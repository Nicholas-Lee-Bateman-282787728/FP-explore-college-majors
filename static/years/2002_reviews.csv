661053,"Vatel, Fran?ois (fr&Scaron;Nsw&Scaron; v&Scaron;tl)(KEY), fl. 17th cent., French chef, famous in the time of Louis XIV. Mme Marie de S&#x17D;vign&#x17D;,in her letters, speaks of him as the chef of the prince of Cond&#x17D; and says that on a Friday, when the king was coming to dinnerand the fish failed to arrive in time, Vatel committed suicide. The authenticity of this story is doubtful.-The Columbia Encyclopedia, Sixth Edition.2001.Playwright/Screenwriter Tom Stoppard and Director Roland Joffe have taken the Francois Vatel of historical legend and turned him into aquintessential French hero in this fabulous looking but oddly soulless film.  In France in 1671, Louis XIV is King and, as Mel Brooks might say : ""It'sgood to be the King!"" Fab babes are always ready to get their freak on with you and your nobles will do anything to curry favor.  So when the Princede Conde is informed that Louis and his court will be coming to visit his estate , Chantilly, Conde tells his famed steward Vatel to pull out all thestops.  Perversely, Conde, who is in desperate need of money, will have to plunge himself even deeper into debt in the mere hope that Louis willchoose him to command the royal forces in the coming war with Holland.Given a blank check, Vatel proceeds to put on the most sumptuous and ornate feasting imaginable.  There's a moment early in the King's visit whereas the King walks through the garden the scenery rises, collapses, is rearranged and fits together again like pieces of an elaborate puzzle--by itself thisscene is worth the price of admission.  It is remarkable.  As the visit goes on, Vatel must improvise when shortages crop up, must respond to theextravagant requests of the various guests, and must navigate the petty jealousies of the spoiled visitors.  He gets himself in a real bind when hedallies with the beautiful and reserved Anne de Montausier (Uma Thurman) who is both the King's latest favorite and the object of desire of the nastyand vindictive Marquis de Lauzon (Tim Roth).The caged bird imagery that Mr. Joffe resorts to is a tad heavy-handed, but the film nicely captures the stratification of society (though that does makethe relationship between Vatel and Anne rather improbable) and shows the degree to which everyone is subject to the whims of the King, who canmake or break you with the wave of his hand.  Gerard Depardieu as Vatel is appealingly earnest and his total commitment to his work raises it to thelevel of artistry.  He is so decent, and the culture around him so indecent, that we can understand why Anne is attracted to him, even if we don'tbelieve they could have been friends given the circumstances of the day, let alone lovers.Then the story takes a couple of odd twists, one that seems to have been pilfered from Ruggles of Red Gap, as Conde loses Vatel to the King in acard game, then one which matches the fate of the historical Vatel but which occurs for precisely the opposite reason.  In real life Vatel supposedlykilled himself for failing to serve the King well, here he kills himself rather than serve the King at all.  That seems too much license to take withhistory.The film received a well-deserved Oscar nomination for Art Direction, but one wonders if so much energy went into the look of the movie that thefilmmakers lost track of the need to tell a compelling story along with the pretty pictures.  When the climactic scene of the film was going on it cameso suddenly and was shot so obliquely that, not knowing the background of the story,  I honestly didn't realize what had happened right away.  Thelogic they saw on their story boards didn't quite make it to the screen.  It's definitely worth seeing (and DVD is a must), but you can probably watchwith the sound off; it's intended to be looked at more than watched.GRADE : C+",Vatel

484037,"I suppose since I am pro-choice all the stuff on abortion in this movie really does not bother me at all.  This movie is definitely not for pro-lifers.  I agree with some of the other reviewers, Hollywood definitely has a political agenda that it puts forth in its movies, but I really don't see how that detracts from the movies all that much because I really liked this film very much.  I really like Tobey Maguire; I think he is a very good actor and his character, Homer Wells, is a very likeable young man that we want to see succeed in life as more than an apple picker, which makes the ending very satisfying for me in some regards.  The best part of the movie is definitely the beginning, which takes place in the orphanage, but I do think that it was really important for Homer to leave the orphanage and experience more of life.  The ending of the movie is bittersweet and kind of unrealistic, but this does not detract from the overall quality of this film.  Lasse Hallstrom is a wonderful director and I am a devoted fan of his movies.  Personally, I liked the movie because it raised some issues and made some arguments that pro-lifer's needed to hear.  Obviously, Hollywood's political agenda is going to make people mad when it disagrees with their political agenda.",The Cider House Rules VHS
690252,"I initially picked up A.D. Police, because I was bored, and wanted an anime series that was reasonablly priced.  I was'nt sure what to expect.  After the second episode, however, I was hooked.A.D. Police has a drawing quality, which makes you want to see it through to the end.  The two main characters, Kenji, and Klaif, have their share of differneces, which effects their role as partners.  Kenji is a loaner cold as ice type of guy.  WHile Klaif is a freindly type, who cna't remember his past.THe sereis takes some interesting twists and turns, as the two partners hunt Voomers (rouge robots) in the city of Genom.  THe setting is the near future, so don't expect a futuristic mech  type anime.  The series works well as is though.While the ending may not be a total surprise, you'll still want to see how everything turns out for the characters.A.D. Police is also a good value for a five hour anime.  If you're looking for a short, but good anime series at a resonable price, give A.D. Police a try.  You won't be disappointed.",N/A
689805,"Monster's Ball is a very intense movie. It garnished Hallie Berry with her Academy Award and I must admit she did a fantastic job, however this movie is not something I would see again. The performances are good and even Peter Boyle is a standout. Hallie tries hard and performs very well.Billy Bob Thorton is also a deep performer in this piece. Coupled with a really weird town and a really backwards thinking community - this movie shows the harsh realities of prejudice, love, hate and rivalry among a father who doesn't love his son and a son who loves his father.I wouldn't recommend this for the faint of heart and it has a real depressing theme - even Hallie's own child gets a strange twist. Overall the DVD doesn't have a lot of extra features but it does have few trailers of some better films. I was disappointed in this and wasn't quite expecting what I saw. I rented it because this is not a film I would buy.",Monster's Ball
537249,"A number of friends who saw and didn't rave about this movie wanted more of a documentary; a &quot;Tora! Tora! Tora!&quot; with modern special effects. I differ: I believe that each movie stands on its own, both technically, and, more importantly, as a story. I liked the earlier film, but its flaw was and is that it is more of a documentary. &quot;Pearl Harbor&quot; may well be a misnomer for a great story that goes well beyond December 7, 1941, but if you can set all that aside, this is, from almost all perspectives, a really good movie. The characters are believeable people experiencing real world problems, and one cannot help but be drawn into the drama thus created. Both male leads do very well, but I thought that special praise goes to Kate Beckinsale for portraying a young nurse who comes face to face with horrendous loss of life and injuries and, as a result, matures as a character from dilletant to combat nurse.  It's a great job of acting. The story of two young flyers starts in their boyhood and beginning careers as Army flyers (There was no US Air Force then, just the Army Air Corps). One (Ben Affleck) flys in the Battle of Britain and is believed killed; his friend ( Josh Hartnett) and his fiancee (Beckinsale) fall in love, and the dramatic tension occurs when Affleck surfaces alive and well. The special effects are fantastic; I never got the sense of a computer trying to fool me, although military historians will note that some of the ships that blow up could not have been at the real attack because their radar masts didn't exist then. But one can always nit pick at details. The fact is that &quot;Pearl Harbor&quot; has suffered somewhat in the press, but don't let that cause you to turn away from it. You are in for a stunning visual experience with this one. And visually and sonically it is all that we have come to expect of the DVD medium.",N/A

I also own the DVD of ""Pearl Harbor"" I feel that the computer graphics used to generate the attack scenes in ""Pearl"" are something that can't be equaled and must be seen to be believed, ""Tora"" give a much more detailed and accurate account of the events surrounding December 7, 1941. Since the first time that I saw Tora Tora Tora, I have always been fascinated by the degree of knowledge that the members of the military community in Washington D.C. had of the ""Surprise"" attack by The Japanese Empire. In conclusion, I highly recommend this movie to anyone who has an interest in the events of World War II.",N/A
140096,"How does one describe Blue Velvet? Disturbing, entertaining, romantic (yes, I did say romantic), mysterious, brilliant. Those words all describe Blue Velvet. This is a masterpiece of cinema. With all of David Lynch's brilliance, he has or may never touch a film this great again.Dennis Hopper. Why isn't this man in a category of the legends? Why isn't he revered as much as Pacino, DeNiro or Nicholson? Dennis Hopper can take the most wacked-out roles and transform them into legendary villains (Speed, Apocalypse Now).Kyle MacLachlan does an incredible job with his protagonistic role as does Laura Dern, playing the innocent virgin. Isabella Rossellini is also incredible as the victim, and there is always the cast of crazy characters David Lynch is famous for (Dean Stockwell, Jack Nance, to name a few). But the show is stolen by the script and cinematography. The scene of Dean Stockwell's lip sync is one of the greatest scenes in the history. It's why we have film. Plus, extra mention should me made about the score.Blue Velvet is not for the kids. It has graphic language, nudity and some violent moments not for the squeamish.

520411,"I would just like to start by saying the movie presented in this edition is splendid looking and sounding.The visuals are still stunningly clear and sound still makes me jump out of my seat. The second DVD on the other hand could have been left out. It is just a blantant marketing ploy trying to convince us to buy the video game, Enya's CD, Two Towers, and the extended version of the movie coming out on DVD in November. The two ""In-depth Documentary's"" were made for TV before the movie came out, basically for promotional purposes. One of which I had already seen on Sci-Fi. Knowing that an extended version would be released at a later date and already knowing the sub-par material I bought this edition anyway just because it is the only way to get the theatrical version. Knowing what I did i wasn't suprised at how bad the suplemental material was. I would have been happy if they would have put just a commentary and movie on one disc, but then again I love commentaries.As for the movie itself, it is a great action/fantasy/romance movie. If Tolkien could see this his only complaint would probably be more singing and for it to be longer. Its been along time since I've read the book so i'm not sure how much Jackson cut out but other than the noticable exclusion of Farmer Maggot and Tom Bombadil (sp?) it follows Tolkien's story pretty faithfully. I may get stoned by Tolkien and Peter Jackson fans alike for this comment but i would like to see another Lord of the Rings movie trilogy maybe animated. We need a quality animated version of the movie that maybe can be a little more faithful to the spirit of Tolkien.I bought this edition of the DVD on sale for [money] and i don't think i would spend much more than that for DVD without a commentary and a decent documentary. Once again, the movie is a great little escape into fantasy for three hours or so but it is obvious Jackson wants us to buy two different versions of this movie. And being the sucker I am, I probably will buy the extended version in November.",The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring

423244,"""Stagecoach"" is a landmark film in so many ways. While probably not the very best western ever created this stunning production is memorable as being one of the first of the genre where just as much emphasis was placed on character development as action. It also marked the breakthrough role (and first collaboration with frequent director Ford) for a young John Wayne after a decade of appearing in countless B films, and the first time that director John Ford used his most favourite location of Monument Valley, Utah for shooting which gives this film an almost out of this world ,mythical quality.Produced in the magical year of 1939 ""Stagecoach"" more than holds its own with all the other great classics produced in that year. Honoured with two Academy Awards for its musical score and the beautiful performance by Thomas Mitchell as the drunken doctor travelling on the stagecoach the film tells a very simple story of the intertwined lives of a group of people travelling through dangerous Indian territory on a stagecoach and how each effects the others lives in different ways. Ford assembled a sterling cast of performers here and apart from Wayne as the wrongly convicted  outlaw the Ringo Kid we have the before mentioned Thomas Mitchell (in the same year that he played Scarlett O'Hara's father in ""Gone With The Wind""), as the drunken doctor who is forced to deliver a baby on route, Claire Trevor in a superb performance as the ""scarlett lady"" Dallas, run out of town for her morals who forms an attachment to Wayne's character , Andy Devine as the coach driver and John Carradine as the shady gambler Hatfield. Donald Meek also registers as the fumbling spirits salesman who keeps having his samples raided by Mitchell. Louise Platt also does some memorable work as the very pregnant Lucy Mallory, travelling on the stagecoach to join her husband who gives birth during the journey and with help from Dallas learns a good lesson in understanding and tolerance of other's failings. ""B"" movie cowboy veteran Tom Tyler also makes a rare appearance as the Ringo Kid's nemesis Luke Plummer who is involved in a shoot out with Ringo at the finale.""Stagecoach"" contains many memorable moments, the most outstanding without a doubt being the lengthy and cleverly filmed Indian attack on route which contains some of the most amazing stunt work seen in films up till then. It is the work of stuntman genius Yakima Canutt who doubled for John Wayne in all the complicated action sequnces such as when the Ringo Kid takes control of the horses leading the stagecoach when it is attacked. These stunt scenes became re-used footage in countless westerns over the succeeding years so brilliant they were and are still considered.While not being a huge fan of the western genre I do love this film for its intelligent writing and attention to character development often not seen in alot of westerns. The beautiful location photography adds a tremendous boost to the overall look of the film and really sets the mood for the whole piece. It is such a landmark film in so many ways already mentioned however for sheer entertainment value for those that like action adventure tales it is unsurpassed. I dont feel you even need to be a western lover to enjoy it so well crafted are the characters and the action story that they are involved in. For stirring western excitement you can't go past John Ford's memorable classic ""Stagecoach"".",Stagecoach VHS
481977,"Want proof that this isn't a true sequel: Even Iron Monkey himself never dresses like he did in the first film.  Before he always had half his face covered, but now he does most his fighting in leisure suits with everyone seeing his face. Even the original music is absent, instead we get a musical score from the movie ""True Lies"" (I know, I own the soundtrack) during the action scenes, repeating the same string in one of the music tracks over and over (almost in every fight--at least at 5 different times!). In fact, besides dubbing in the use of the name ""Iron Monkey"" every once and a while, this is basically an older Donnie Yen movie re-released with the ""Iron Monkey 2"" label. Somebody tried way to hard to market in on the ""Iron Monkey"" name, and it shows quite badly.The only thing that made me keep watching was the frequent appearance of astonishing hyper-kinetic fight scenes choreographed by Yuen Ho-Ping, not the endlessly inventive Yuen Woo-Ping (as Amazon.com states), who came to fame as the fight choreographer of ""The Matrix."" Many people think that Woo-Ping did the fight choreography in this one... but he didn't. Those that have seen many of his other movies will notice the fight scenes lack a certain charisma that only Woo-Ping can deliver. Still, the curious thing is that, after a while, this choppy movie starts to lurch into a good-old kung fu spectacle. Iron Monkey 2 grows strangely compelling. It's as if, through directorial incompetence, the movie has been distilled to the basic elements of cinematic storytelling.This is not Yuen Woo-Ping's work, but I believe you may find it worth it because of Donnie Yen, who many believe is up there in on screen-fighting-fireworks with the likes of Jet Li and Jackie Chan. The other highlight in this movie was the actor who portrayed the son looking for his father --he had incredible martial arts skills in his own right. His fight with Donnie Yen was arguably one of the better ones in the film. The one bad thing was that we get more fighting from this looking-for-father guy than Donnie Yen himself. He's not a bad fighter, but I bought the movie looking for most of the fights with the Iron Monkey himself involved.By itself, you have some good fighting with some really bad dubbing and a reused music track from the movie ""True Lies."" But when you slap the name of the sequel to one of Yuen Woo-Ping's best work to it, too many comparisons will be made.",Iron Monkey 2
88838,"When Exorcist hit the big screen in the seventies, audiences around the nation waited in lines around the block to get into theatres everywhere. This movie revolted, facsinated, and flat out scared the hell out of them, and most of them loved it! The rest either fled the theatre in sheer terror, or became sick, and went home to turn on all the lights, and head straight for church the next AM. Wow. What a movie, and a stroke of brilliant filmmaking, to get an audience to behave as such. There are many subtle scenes that may escape those who only want to see head spinning and green pea soup. Such as the young priest's disturbing dreams about his mother. Young Regan fooling around with an Ouija Board, or the nasty demonic visage that keeps popping it's face throughout the possessed house. Regan eventually transforms into one of the most terrifying monsters in cinematic history. Her possessed 12 yr. old girl character is demonic, vile and pure evil. One can almost feel the chill in her room, or smell her repulsiveness. Dr. Billy Graham himself admitted that the film had a sense of real evil to it. The reason it scares us is fear of the unknown. If one is strictly an atheist, then it is sheer nonsense. But if one has faith in God, or any gods, then possession is a VERY real reality. The fact that the film's screenplay was based on a real story that happened in the Midwest in the fifties, only adds to the sense of dread and terror that one feels alone at night after viewing this movie. Throughout history, and in the Bible there are many mentions of demonic possession. If these instances werent mere seizures, or mental illness, then perhaps the horror that Linda Blair portrays is chillingly real.",N/A

How can you go wrong with [bad] ET ripoff?Here's the story:A group of really bad and argumentative musicians decide to go on vacation to some place that is mountainous and always shrouded in fog.  They end up taking a groupie along with them whom everyone (especially the other women in the group) hates.  At the same time, a trio of stupid poachers, consisting of Lorne Green, Norm Abrahams and a Rennaissance Festival leather mug-maker investigate a meteor that hit the ground near there.  The meteor turns out to be a ship (i guess it was a ship, even though the budget, apparently, wouldn't allow for one to be shown) loaded with eggs that hatch into a cross between ET and snuffelupaguss.  Norm Abrahams smashes a bunch of the eggs, which causes an adult alien to kill him and hunt down his buddies.  Meanwhile, a young, insect-collecting boy finds one of the eggs and decides to hatch it in his bed (ewwww!).  The musicians find themselves at the boy's house eventually, after causing the death of the groupie that went with them.  Well, the egg hatches, and the alien, whom the boy calls Trumpy, is actually very nice, but his magic act [is bad].  However, his relative who killed the poachers isn't nearly as friendly, and sets about killing the musicians and the boy's curmudgeon of an uncle.  Finally, the kid sends Trumpy packing into the forest because he knows that humans and trunked aliens cannot live in peace.Man, this movie is REALLY bad.  But Joel and the Bots make it fun.

In the first, she's a prim college professor who's really a witch/succubus with a taste for turning the tables on amorous young men. The second has her as a spinster with a split personality---allowing her to play ""two"" roles. And the last is the now famous Zuni fetish doll story that has the doll coming to life and terrorizing her all over her apartment. She's a lonely career woman dominated by her mother and the ending has her possessed by the spirit of the doll waiting for mama to come over. A great ending. The movie is Black's show all the way.

701762,"I went into this movie as a lover of the Escaflowne series, but I knew not to set my expectations too high.  I read the reviews and most people said that it is best if you take the movie on its own terms without comparing it to the series.Well I have to admit, that's a little hard to do.  People who have seen the series will be absolutely flabbergasted that their favorite characters and storyline have been butchered into something boderline incoherent.  People who haven't seen the show will likely be very confused and bored by the storyline which seems to cram way to much into too little time (hardly a surprise considering the source material).Although I didn't really care for the character redesigns, I have to say that visually Escaflowne is a spectacular movie.  The opening scene where Van bisects the crew of an airship is worth a rental at least.  The problem is that the creators forgot what made Escaflowne the series so special to begin with.  It wasn't the animation, the giant Gymelfs or even the storyline (although it was excellent).  No, Escaflowne's biggest appeal was the endearing characters, especially Van, Hitomi and Folken.  The problem with the movie is that I actually detested the characters movie counterparts as they exhibited exactly none of the facination of the series.So what are we left with here?  A boring movie with stale dialogue, uninteresting characters and an absolute affront to fans of the TV show that has some remarkably stunning visuals.  Would I recommend it?  No, visuals alone do not make a movie and if you liked the Escaflowne series even a little bit then you probably don't want to see this movie as it will likely leave a very bitter taste in your mouth over all the wasted potential that is here.",N/A

I do like Grace Kelly very much. She was a beautiful woman, and I loved her strange way of talking. So I liked seeing her and of course the diamond (it was quite impressive), but as for the rest of the movie, it was a real bore. I do not care for Frank Sinatra, Bing is okay, but there was too much singing and the songs weren't even good in my opinion. I felt the script was very loose and vague, and all along I kept wondering, ""when is the ACTION going to happen?""  It also seemed a bit silly as well. I don't go for such lightweight fair, no matter who is in it. As I said, I was glad to see Grace Kelly, but I will never watch this again.

574327,"A cabana boy (Joseph Feinnes) falls in love with a married woman (Gretchen Mol) who is staying at the vacation resort that employs him along with her politically powerful husband (Ray Liota). After a little maneuvering the cabana boy seduces the married woman and then inserts his jade stem in her jade passageway followed by tearful farewells and her inevitable return home. Consumed by passion the cabana boy follows her to Yonkers New York where he continues to park his jizzm wagon in her love garage until her husband gets wind of things and warns him to stay away. Upon failing to heed this advice, cabana boy is shot and left for dead, but as luck would have it, he survives with his head conveniently disfigured beyond recognition. In the spirit of Monte Christo, cabana boy takes a few years off to build a new identity complete with wealth and powerful fiscal/criminal credentials before returning to the Empire State to obtain vengeance and to reclaim the object of his desires. In case it isn't patently clear what he's up to, he takes the name ""Esquema"" and a fake South American (but not Brazilian) accent. Cabana boy insinuates himself in the husband's life, solves his racketeering problems and then demands his wife as payment. Before you can say, ""what is the point of revealing yourself if you're not going to kill him"", cabana boy seduces the wife again and runs off with her. The couple spend an idyllic night in the country during which cabana boy repeatedly inserts his splutter plug into the wife's love socket before the husband catches up to them and shoots cabana boy in the morning. During the inconclusive ambulance ride in which we guess that cabana boy will either wind up dead or further disfigured/disguised, the wife reminds him of how they first met.Oddly enough, this film is so wretchedly bad that it's good. ""Forever Mine"" is poorly done to the point of being wildly entertaining. How Joseph Feinnes and Ray Liota got roped into this film is beyond me. Even more puzzling is how Ray Liota who electrified audiences with his portrayal of visceral villains in ""Something Wild"" and ""Good Fellows"" managed to play such an incompetent bad guy in this film.

374408,"I consider this one of the best films ever made and unarguably one of the most unforgettable; the opening scene is proof of that. This is based on the true life story of a New Zealand murder/matricide that shocked the world and it is directed by the genius Peter Jackson, who obviously insists on leaving a haunting impact on the viewer. The story follows two highly imaginative girls who're outcasts but when they meet they form an obsessive--though beautiful-- bond, creating an imaginary world only they can share, completely shutting out everyone and everything else around them. When their parents discover the intensity of their relationship, they threaten to tear them apart, causing the girls to plot the unthinkable. Both Winslet and Lynskey are mesmerizing as the beyond creative and imaginative duo who simultaneously manage to delight and frighten us with utmost perfection. They are able to move us with their dedicated affection for one another while also provoking a bit of uneasiness in us, afraid of what they're going to do next. The story is beautiful, haunting, suspenseful, thrilling, and nothing short of awe-inspiring and I highly reccommend it to anyone with a touch of creativity in them!!",Heavenly Creatures VHS

204442,"History buffs, lovers of Tudor England, and historical dramas in general could not help but be impressed by this magnificent production that is rich in detail, characterisation, historical research and perfect contemporary backdrops. I know it has always been an absolute favourite of mine among all the fine historical films produced in the late 1960's and early 1970's.""Anne Of The Thousand Days"" despite a few strayings from the historical truths, at times is a painstakingly researched production that tries to always be as accurate as possible in its retelling of the tragic rise and fall of the fascinating Anne Boleyn, second wife of King Henry VIII. Tudor England was a time of great beauty, savagery, religious upheaval and pagentry and this is all captured beautifully in this film. Indeed ""Anne Of The Thousand Days"" is a visual and indeed intellectual feast for the eyes and the brain. Towering above the whole massive production here is Genevieve Bujold in the role of a life time as Anne Boleyn. Never has she been so perfectly cast as here. During the course of the film she develops from the simple girl just arrived back in England from her time at the stylish French court, who catches the eye of the England's august and rather frightening monarch, to that of  being England's Queen who must live by her own wits alone if she is to survive in such unsure times. It is a stunning performance filled with equal amounts of fire, passion, sorrow, wit and spirit. The character of Anne is well researched here and Bujold rightly won an Academy Award Nomination for her performance here. Richard Burton had his last real stand out role as Henry VIII in this production. Many famous actors have portrayed Henry on stage and screen and Keith Michell's superb portrayal of the king was still ahead in the future when this film was made. Burton is wonderfully believable as Henry and fits the part like a glove with equal parts, majestic presence, selfishness, cruelty and great passion, just how this most famous of monarch's is envisioned. Burton also received an Academy Award Nomination for his colourful and beautifully balanced performance and his Henry has rightly joined the few who are deservedly remembered for their portrayals, Charles Laughton and Keith Michell in particular.""Anne Of The Thousand Days' is rich in wonderful performances from Michael Hordern and Katherine Blake as Thomas and Elizabeth Boleyn, Anne's parents to Anthony Quayle in a superb performance of world weary splendour as the infamous Cardinal Wolsey. William Squire as Thomas More and Joseph O'Conor as Archbishop Fisher, two men bound up in all the tragic tumult of Henry's Reformation and who were sacrificed for Anne's sake also excel. Irene Papas portrays Henry's first wife Catherine of Aragon and while her very dark appearance perhaps fails to match the Red/Gold hair and pale complexion of the real Catherine, she is very impressive in her brief scenes as Henry's cast off wife who fought him all the way by refusing to grant him the divorce he eagerly sought thus bringing on the English Reformation. In a small but standout role Valerie Gearon plays Mary Boleyn, Anne's older sister and former mistress of Henry. While their relationship was historical fact in the film she is portrayed carrying Henry's child. That fictional development aside her's is a wonderful performance filled with the anger and uselessness felt by many women in the man's world of Tudor England.The film is full of wonderful moments. Two standouts are Anne's triumphal procession through London where she is greeted by the jeers and insults of an outraged population who thought of her as a whore and her final speech to Henry in the Tower (fictional but carried of with finesse) prior to her execution where she gives nothing away to him and declares that ""her blood will be well spent"" and predicts that ""her daughter (Elizabeth) will become a greater Queen than England has ever known. Stirring stuff and Genevieve Bujold makes the most of such a juicy part. The period flavour is caught beautifully and for all its brutality the Tudor period was sumptous in costumes, interior decoration, garden design etc. These are all faithfully reproduced in ""Anne Of The Thousand Days"" to maximum effect and the film is a gorgeous feast for the eyes.For any student of Tudor history this film is a must see. I love it for its sterling attempt within the confines of popular entertainment to tell the story as it was. Production values are top notch and one feels the spirit of that young Boleyn girl who unwillingly found herself thrust into the historical spotlight, and who  became a woman in the process, in each frame of Bujold's performance.",N/A

259543,"Each time I watch this wonderful movie about the shades of gray we use to cement together the brickwork of our lives, I think of James Stewart's comment in the trailer at the beginning of the movie as he describes doing the original play on the road, when invariably some kid in the audience would loudly ask, ""Where's the rabbit""? Where is he indeed! I wanna see the damned rabbit, too!  Yet this thought-provoking parable about what is real and what isn't and the shades of each we use to try to live our lives as best we can, remains one of the all-time favorites of people who love to watch movies.James Stewart portrays Elwin P. Dowd as a more than slightly-tipsy drinker who happens to enjoy the company of his constant company Harvey, a six-foot- something invisible (and imaginary?)  rabbit. Now all of the terrific character actors in the film are of one opinion or another about the rabbit, but all agree that Dowd is an altogether pleasant man who everyone enjoys having around. Yet his incessant and insistent ramblings about Harvey make him an embarrassment, and some of them are honestly concerned about him. So what to do about Elwin? And what do you think about the rabbit?As for me, I prefer to think the rabbit is real, but chooses to be invisible. More interesting that way. And you have to admit the porch swing does rock without anyone else on it in the last scene, after all. I've tried the rabbit routine a few times when in a particularly whimsical mood, and it always brings smiles and conversation. So what's wrong with having a big albeit invisible rabbit as a drinking chum? A guy could do a lot worse. See the movie; it is a bona-fide classic. I have to give this one two thumbs WAY UP!

520924,"15 years from now, people are going to pick up this movie and wonder why so many people thought it was bad--there's actually very little wrong with it: memorable performances from Sizemore, Stamp and Kilmer, better science than the average Hollywood flick, a nifty mystery, a logical triumph of man over machine (aren't we all a little tired of omnipotent, indestructible robots?), and crisp suspense as the astronauts race the clock to escape the tightening noose of a mission gone awry.It was promoted as a SF/Horror flick similar to ALIEN, and it really isn't--it's more like Alfred Hitchcock directing THE RIGHT STUFF.All the SF movie fans I know tend to like byzantine tales, historic in scope, filled with quirky characters roaming rich new landscapes, so this simple tale of a small group of men trying to escape a desolate red planet within a short span of hours might not be rich enough for them. (The SF fanboys won't like it because Carrie-Anne Moss's shower scene is too short and doesn't show enough...er...Moss.)It's definitely worth a rental, but you won't want to own it unless you're a suspense fan that revels more in how a film is put together than in how it turns out.",N/A
52872,"Everybody knows what Conan is about, so I won't bore you with that. What I *will* say is that this is some sort of director's cut, with several scenes in it I'd never seen before (and I'm a die-hard Conan fangirl). The scenes help the movie considerably. There are a few deleted scenes regarding King Osric included as freebies and a little deleted scene of the director as a peasant selling Conan lizard-on-a-stick in Zamora, but these are fribble and not in the actual movie. The included scenes include a vastly expanded role for Osric's daughter (didn't you wonder why she even got billing? In the VHS edition she gets about as much screen time and dialog as the half-naked sacrificial victim in the Tower where the jewel was) and some explanatory stuff that helped the movie flow better. I can't imagine why they were cut to begin with, but they made the movie as fresh to watch this time as it was the first time I saw it.There's some &quot;making of&quot; stuff that was fun to watch, some stuff we'd seen before and lots of new stuff -- a very frail Max von Sydow talking about how he took the role of Osric because his kid was into the comics, a suprisingly mature Sandahl Bergman talking about how her finger got severed during a fight scene, the composer telling how he composed Valeria's funeral song after a terrible nightmare about his own family dying... The director also explains how he decided upon his cast, which was neat, and set producers and animal handlers talk about their particular challenges. I'd never seen or heard most of this before, so that was interesting. The &quot;archives&quot; show onsite photos and drawings and whatnot, which didn't do a ton for me but which others might find interesting. A small bio of whatshisname who wrote the Conan books is given.I already owned this on VHS, and bought the DVD because I was afraid my tape was wearing out. I'm glad I got it.

161025,"This is a movie that, if memory serves, performed less than spectacularly at the box office.  I suppose the reason for this is that when people go to see a movie about Robin Hood, they generally want to see swashbuckling action, topped off with a happy ending where good triumphs. That's what viewers of Robin Hood movies have been used to ever since Errol Flynn swung a sword in the role.  This movie, on the other hand, features relatively little action, and a distinctly tragic ending (it's also the only screen treatment of the character I know of that portrays a variant of the actual legend of Robin's end, and the arrow shot blindly to mark the site of his grave).  Instead of an upbeat, good-triumphs-over-evil swashbuckler, which most Robin Hood movies are, ""Robin and Marian"" is melancholy character study with a rather tragic ending.  I think this left moviegoing audiences feeling a bit let down when the film debuted, and resulted in a relatively poor box office performance.But since then, many people have come to appreciate the movie for its considerable artistic merits.  I have always loved this movie, and for many of the reasons already listed by other reviewers.  It has a truly inspired cast, a tremendously moving ending, the chemistry between the two leads is extraordinary, and the movie presents a new and interesting take on some of the classic characters of English folklore.What really stands out for me though is the late Robert Shaw's brilliant performance as the Sheriff of Nottingham.  This is the only time I have ever seen the character portrayed on screen as anything other than a throughly contemptible villain.  The Sheriff has been seen as everything from the greedy, rapacious robber baron of the old British ""Robin of Sherwood"" TV series, to the over-the-top, caricature of evil portrayed by Alan Rickman in ""Robin Hood: Prince of Thieves"".  In this movie, Shaw shows us a very believable, and very human Sheriff.He's obviously cleverer than Robin, and it's also obvious that he truly respects his old adversary.  A really touching scene is when the Sheriff warns Robin not to interfere and try to rescue Marian from the fate she has chosen for herself.  It's clear he doesn't at all want to be Robin's enemy again.  In another scene, he actually laments the death of one of his soldiers - something no other actor's Sheriff would have done in a million years.  This Sheriff is actually a rather likeable figure in his way, and if he's a bad guy, it's only because he is a creature of duty and is determined to carry out the orders of his king, even when the king is an unworthy master.It's fascinating to see such a human portrayal of the Sheriff, to match the realistic human portrayals all the other actors bring to their characters.  This is really one of the most underrated pictures out there.  I highly recommend it.",N/A
82911,"Here we have one of the funniest, most creative and original, and genuinely emotional animated films that has EVER been created, and this pretentious ""Watchman-on-the-Wall"" person has the nerve to put it down for elements that don't even figure into it.  ""Lilo & Stitch"" is the only movie I have ever seen that makes me cry literally from beginning to end; half the time because it's just that charming and funny, and the other half the time because the themes of love, loyalty, and family are SO beautifully and tenderly conveyed.  Right from the film's opening credits sequence you will surely have tears in your eyes from the sheer beauty of the Hawaiian musical numbers and the open affection of the filmmakers for the Hawaiian culture.  On a character note, Lilo has perhaps more depth than any animated character I've ever seen.  Her eccentricities and emotional baggage make her, by turns, delightfully charming and totally heartbreaking.  Stitch is, hands-down, the most original and entertaining animated character I have EVER seen, and so long as he is on the screen, I am having the BEST time with all of his fantastically wonderful random movements and noises.  ""Lilo & Stitch"" also deserves kudos for having the courage to be so modern in its handling of such important real-life issues as broken familes and Departments of Child Welfare.  This is an absolutely brilliant and deeply moving little film that deserves FAR better than the lazy, cheesy direct-to-video sequel and TV series that are already in the works, and my only wish at this point is that Disney would treat their finest properties with enough reverence and respect to give them the better-thought-out *theatrical* sequel treatment they so strongly deserve.  I may not pay much attention to the forthcoming direct-to-video ""Stitch: The Movie,"" but ""Lilo & Stitch"" is one movie that I personally cannot WAIT to add to my personal DVD collection... it has entertained and moved me more thoroughly than any other movie I have had the privelige of seeing this year!

683581,"Chances are, if you're considering this DVD purchase, then you're familiar with Michael Moore.  The renegade filmmaker behind Roger and Me returns for the second season of his Emmy-nominated documentary TV show &quot;The Awful Truth.&quot;  It ran on Bravo! in the summer of 2000, and Moore returns to his familiar Times Square setting for more of his guerilla-style harassment of all things nasty.Moore's satirical fist knows no friends: he takes stabs at both major political parties (note to Conservatives: just because he bashes you doesn't mean he doesn't bash Liberals, too!), goes after screwy judicial systems, the mainstream media, religious nutjobs, and even himself.  Some of his stunts include driving a taxi in New York that refuses to pick up white people, sending a pimp to Congress (to make the point that politicians who whore out votes in exchange for campaign contributions are &quot;hos&quot;), importing Iraqi gas and selling it for 60 cents a gallon, and a new short film: Ficus, in which he runs a ficus plant for an uncontested Congress nomination (and, by all counts, WINS).  This season is much more hit-and-miss than the first season, with some episodes, like the pimp, worth watching over and over, while others are pretty darn boring.  But, all in all, there's certainly enough here to justify this 2-disc set.The video is presented in crisp full-frame, which makes sense because most of it was shot digitally.  The sound mix is a strong DD 2.0, standard TV-show fare - there isn't enough here to really rock the old subwoofer anyway, and the mix is more than adequate.  The only extras are some Bookie segments that didn't appear on TV, and Michael Moore's commentary on four of the episodes.  His commentary is hilarious and informative, which is generally what I'd expect from Mike.  The only disappointment is that Awful Truth episodes ran 60 seconds longer in the UK, and it would have been cool to see that extra footage, but hey, it's a minor complaint.So sit back, pop in this DVD, and get ready to think.  Rather than succumb to the fallacies of those he satirizes, by offering easy, cookie-cutter, bumper-sticker answers, Moore is content raising questions and letting us work through them on our own.  It's a sign of maturity, intellect, and a true desire to change the world: people are more apt to work for themselves when they figure out the answers to problems on their own, instead of listening to MSNBC, chubby radio talk-show hosts, or the 700 club for the &quot;cheat-sheet&quot; solutions.

708003,"After a few months of waiting, I finally checked out ""Queen of the Damned"" for myself. I really didn't have the time to see it in the theater. But now that I have seen it, let me just say that this is the best Anne Rice adaption that I've seen  since her first film adaption from her ""Vampire Chronicles"" series, ""Interview with the Vampire"" back in 1994! But, there is also another side to the film as well...and that is to remember the late, great songstress Aaliyah (""Romeo Must Die""), who died so tragically in that horrible plane crash after filming this movie. I think that she was either 22 or 23 when it happened. To me, ""Queen of the Damned"" is not really a sequel, but more of a continuation as to what happened at the end of ""Interview with the Vampire"" involving the vampire Lestat (who was played by superstar Tom Cruise at the time). ""Queen of the Damned"" focuses once again on Lestat (Now portrayed by Stuart Townsend, ""Shooting Fish""), who awakens after his 100-year slumber only to find himself among a new trend in the world...the world of rock music. And so, Lestat finds acceptance in a tattooed and pierced world by reinventing himself as a rock star. And Lestat becomes an overnight sensation around the world, etc. Meanwhile, his intoxicating Goth-riffed sound waves not only awakens the almighty Queen of the Vampires, Akasha (Aaliyah), but his sound also rekindles Akasha's desires as well, which is simply...to rule once again! And to also have Lestat rule by her side as well! Unless an elite few can stop Akasha's reign, everyone, even vampires, in the whole world is doomed! In conclusion, ""Queen of the Damned"" is in the same scary and gothic spirit as any other horror flick that I've seen, but better! I now own the DVD version of the film which includes tons of extras such as a many number of featurettes (including a featurette that pays tribute to the beloved Aaliyah), 13 deleted scenes, 3 full-length Lestat music videos as they were performed in the film, extended Death Valley concert sequences, theatrical trailer, and DVD-ROM features. And also, in conclusion, this film has not only two great performances from both Stuart Townsend and Aaliyah, but also an excellent supporting cast including Marguerite Moreau (""Firestarter: Rekindled""), Vincent Perez (""The Crow: City of Angels""), and Lena Olin (""Romeo is Bleeding""), as well as an incredible storyline, and a great soundtrack to add!

Now I'm something of an anomaly in my family, because all the otherGuys'n'Gals did devour this trilogy. So really, for someone who never read it, I've certainly heard enough about it over the years. I know character and place names, the way children sometime pick up details about the parents' childhoods through hearing twicetold tales.Twenty years ago, I saw the lambasted cartoon version of LofR. Well, contrary to what so many have said--I don't see the difference between the two! I mean, that wasn't SO bad, but this is not at ALL as good as I was led to believer. Don't get me wrong, I wanted to like this movie badly: after all, threee hours is quite an investment of one's time. But I felt cold and unaffected by the goings-on. Probably didn't help that I was there on an unsatisfactory date, either. But all the more reason to escape into fantasy, you see!And the one detail that annoyed me more than anything else, was this: There are SO many scenes of an outstretched palm on which the ring is sitting. Every single palm--and there were several that had a go at this--was filthy dirty. One friend countered and said that I had to understand that folks were on this journey and would of course get dirty.

513279,"The Film:Positively unique. While I see parallels between Run Lola Run and its 1999 counterpart, Fight Club, the instances are only fleeting and probably have more to do with the fact that I saw the two films shortly after one another than they do with actual similarities. Or perhaps it's how both films have taken a novel idea and let it run its course, flaws and all, producing something that's much stronger when all's said and done.If the stranger who brushed past you this morning had walked an extra couple inches to their left, what kind of an effect do you think it might have had on the rest of your life? If the film is to be trusted, a bit more than you'd think. One woman, mere scenery in any other film, goes from lotto winner to baby stealer to bible pusher after her chance meetings with Lola. And that's where the real strength lies here. More than anything else, Run is a story about everyday lives, and how conceivably miniscule changes can alter an entire lifetime. Despite the imaginative camera angles and Quentin Tarantino meets Guy Ritchie storyline, the real focus of the movie is the interaction with the regular Joe, and the ultimate result of that interaction.Sure, there are some scenes I'd have done differently. But like they say, hindsight is 20 / 20 and everybody's the world's finest director from their couch (or, in this case, from behind their monitors). Some transitions are awkward, but the characters are there in full force, and the possibly-complicated plot is handled to perfection. Add to that the list of risky camera tricks that paid off in spades, and you've got a healthy package. Highly Recommended.9 / 10DVD Extras:Not exactly a stack of bonus features, but those that are present really do pack a punch. First, and most notably, is the option to watch the film in English or original German with English subtitles... which, if you've ever heard the American voice actors, you'll know isn't really that much of an option. Put plainly, the English dub blows. Go for German with the subtitles, and enjoy the original vocal inflections in all their glory.You also get a feature-length commentary from writer / director / producer Tom Tykwer and Lola herself, actress Franka Potente. This one's a real goldmine, if you're into insightful audio commentary, as the two reveal bits and pieces the uneducated eye would have blown past without a second thought. Honestly, the definition of what a DVD commentary track should be.Finally, there are the prerequisite Theatrical Trailers, which are nothing extraordinary, and a music video from the picture's phenomenal soundtrack. Again, nothing special... mostly just Potente mouthing along to the words of one of the few songs with a vocal track, screaming, and looking a bit bizarre without the bright red hair. It's no surprise the single never really shook the charts.Worth the extra bucks to pick up on DVD, without a doubt. Hell, they could've just given it the German dub and I would've been happy, but the audio commentary makes it all that much nicer.7 / 10",N/A

298493,"One of the few good things about &quot;Fantasia 2000&quot; is that after I saw it, it compelled me to dig out the original Fantasia and watch it again. I fell in love with it all over again. When I first saw it in 1990 at its theatrical re-release, I was only 8 years old. Ten years later, in 2000, I had taken up the violin and I was about to graduate from high school. Watching this film with a new appreciation for classical music that I didn't have in 1990, this film inspired me to stick with the violin and pursue a music major. Another thing that changed when I watched it again in 2000, was my view on the final segment, Night on Bald Mountain and Ave Maria. Today it is my favorite segment of Fantasia. Fantasia's presentation of &quot;Ave Maria&quot; is one of the most spiritually uplifting endings in the history of cinema. The music in this segment is just gorgeous. It showed me that music can have an impact and that it is just as important as any other form of entertainment.Of coarse, it wouldn't be fair not to list some of the other highlights of this film. Highlights include J.S. Bach's &quot;Toccata and Fugue in D minor&quot; which shows off the orchestra and then dissolves into an abstract dream with flashes of light and flying bows and quaking landscapes, Beethoven's &quot;Pastoral symphony&quot; which is a pretty accurate perception of Greek Mythology, except for the centaurettes. Those are purely Disney's idea. Then we have &quot;The Dance of the Hours&quot; Fantasia's funniest and second-most famous (next to the `Sorcerer's Apprentice') this segment features dancing hippos, elephants, ostriches and alligators throughout the coarse of a day from morning to the afternoon, then into the evening and night. This is shown through some very beautiful animation. Sense I was only 8 when I saw this the first time, I was mainly focusing on the cartoon part of it, and the quality of animation made me think it was a new release, and not a 50 year old classic.Forget Fantasia 2000. This movie is the real deal.",Fantasia Walt Disney's Masterpiece  VHS
155755,THis entry in the Candyman series is actually not as bad as one may think.  This time the story revolves around a woman (as usual) who is a direct decndent of the cnadyman.  She doesn't know this at first.  SHe finds out more about this after her brother is arrested blaming the Candyman for the crimes.  The woman summons him sometime along the lines and he is going about the task of seducing her and taking her back with him.

475220,"One of the biggest surprises in '99, this superbly crafted film was majorly overlooked.  The plot is a conventional one but shot and edited brilliantly by Steven Soderbergh from a screenplay by Lem Dobbs.It follows an english ex-con named Wilson (played wonderfully by Terence Stamp) and his quest for vengeance for the murder of his daughter.  Soderbergh and Dobbs' commentary on the DVD is worth the price..  they give an amazing insight into the situations and the overall editing style that makes this movie so interesting to watch.This movie also features a very oddball but amusing cast of supporting actors like Peter Fonda, Leslie Ann Warren and Luis Guzman.Another real interesting note about this movie is how they convinced director Ken Loach to lend them footage from an older film showing a younger Terence Stamp, to integrate with Wilson's ongoing character development.Like modern noir-ish classics like Memento and Insomnia (the original version), The Limey is both entertaining and thought provoking and keeps the audience within it's reach.",The Limey

The group becomes trapped and, one by one, the supporting cast members fall prey to nasty bugs of all shapes and sizes.  Genre veteran Jack Shoulder (Alone in the Dark, The Hidden, and A Nightmare on Elm Street 2: Freddy's Revenge) keeps the pace swift and tension passable.  This movie won't win any awards, but it's a nifty little addition to the creature feature genre.",Arachnid

But the minute the movie came on, my previous thoughts faded and I never left my chair for a second. That's the effect a movie like Red Dragon had on me.  Edward Norton was a wonderful pick for this movie.  His chemistry with Hopkins easily rivaled Foster's.  Ralph Fiennes in my opinion though was the show stealer.  His acting was so convincing that you could almost feel sorry for him and what he was which was a killer ruled by pain and suffering.  For people who thought that the series went downhill after ""Hannibal"", do yourself a favor and see Red Dragon.  Like I said, I liked Hannibal, but Red Dragon shuts the door on it.",N/A

Most notably the main character, Jack Skelington - The Pumpkin King, who is in charge of the yearly preparations for Halloween. One day, Jack stumbles into Christmas Town, a world much more colorful and cheery than his own.

Jack is a sweet skeleton with his heart is in the right place, however...........well, you can imagine.The time and effort taken to create the stop-motion animation in NBC is mind-boggling. I still can't figure out how they created some of the effects.  This is one of those films that commands repeat viewing. I've watched the DVD several times and I always see something new that I hadn't caught before. The attention to detail is magnificent.NBC is a little off the beaten path (it's rated PG), however keep in mind that even though Santa Clause (&quot;Sandy Claws&quot;) is kidnapped and held hostage, the movie has a happy ending.The DVD picture and sound quality (Dolby Digital and DTS) are absolutely marvelous, and the disk is loaded with tons of wonderful extras.",Tim Burton's The Nightmare Before Christmas VHS
669484,"Anyone who's a big fan of blues-rock or guitar-hero rock of the sixties and seventies should get a huge thrill out of this gem. It begins with scenes of the sea thrusting into the Irish coast and then makes its way into a spellbound onstage version of 'Walk On Hot Coals'. Rory Gallagher was definitely the most under-rated blues-rock guitarist of all time; this DVD is proof of it. His style and tone are both blustery and unrefined, but natural and brown-toned as well. His band of himself on vocal and guitar (mainly a strat player), Gerry McAvoy (bass), Lou Martin (piano), and Rod de'Ath (drums), is loud and raw blues-rock heaven. The backstage interviews are interesting, too, as they show how electrified and personable he was. It's blatantly obvious how much he loved playing live by the huge smile on his face and the way he interacts with the crowd. The scenes of Belfast and the rough old Irish nightclubs and venues just add to the raw beauty of the music. This one will be all worn out by the time I'm done watching it and listening to it. It's one of my favorite DVDs.",Rory Gallagher - Irish Tour 1974

674186,"This is another film that has been touted as the next ""Beautiful Thing,"" but it was not the director's intention to make a love story like that.  Rather, this is a series of snapshots of a few days in the lives of two Spanish boys who are heading down different forks in the road.  Though clocked at 90 minutes the movie speeds by in seemingly half that time.Nico is coming to visit Dani at the coast while Dani's parents are away; he is intending to do the same thing he would do if he stayed home in Barcelona, went to Rome, or, for that matter, orbited in the Space Shuttle:  chase skirts.  Dani has begun to hear the tapping of a different drummer and has apparently had a lot of time to plan all the ways he wants to share his new interests with his long time pal.  Clearly these two have been very close.  Krammpack (mutual masturbation), the original title of the play, is not just something they've read about in magazines.The movie is a series of fast moving vignettes of the two boys and the two girls they meet and interact with.  They move from incident to incident quickly, not lingering long nor introspecting much about what has happened.  Though the age of the two is not clear (I've read as young as 15, as old as 17) it is made clear they are both virgins and minors (in much of Europe, 16 is the age of consent).There are some unsettling undertones as Dani experiments with sexuality, mas or menos, oblivious for some time to the fact Nico is increasingly uncomfortable with the moves he is putting on him.  There is a very unsettling, for me, date rape scene, involving the hoary old concoction Spanish Fly, not the modern date rape drug DHA.  The movie remains non-judgemental.  Director Cesc Gay keeps things from getting too heavy both by not lingering on any one incident and with musical punctuation and title cards reminscent of silent films that foreshadow upcoming scenes.  The music in the film is excellent.Nico is played by Jordi Villachi and he is a real charmer.  Though not blessed with extraordinary good looks, it is nevertheless easy to see why Dani and Elena and Berta are drawn to him.  Dani is a very handsome young man, played by Fernando Ramalla with an intensity that is at times eerie.  He is struggling with more difficult issues than Nico, of course, and has anticipated that he is facing almost certain frustration of his desires.When the two go their separate ways one evening Dani, in a lover's snit, tries tarting an older man, which is a cake walk for him, but the better angels of his nature prevail.The movie ends positively; the two's friendship survives the stresses.  Nobody is thrown into therapy nor denounced from the pulpit for their misdeeds.  Nico hasn't given up on chasing skirts and Dani has learned a lot about what he wants, as well as what he doesn't want.  The worst that Nico can bring himself to say of his friend is that he is selfish.I gave the movie four stars but if the system would have let me, I would have given it another 1/4 or 1/2 star, and if it continues to wear well with repeated viewing, as I think it will, I'll be upgrading my rating in a few months.  Nico and Dani is not ""Romeo and Julian,"" nor is it even ""Jaime and Ste,"" but it's a lot closer to them that it is to American Pie, and it's a very good movie.",Nico and Dani
533836,"A lot of folk don't get this movie. The director is dealing not so much with war, but with the creation of a propoganda icon. The film jumps back and forth between reality and myth. In essence, it's the story of the Soviets building up a myth about a heroic sniper in the ruins of Stalingrad, taking his exploits and exagerating them. One scene may be gritty realism, while another surreal myth. The opening scene is a good example of the former, while the climax, in a hushed, mist shrouded rail yard, is the ultimate expression of the latter. Yes, it's impossible to imagine a day when any part of Stalingrad was virtually bereft of sound. The director knows this and that's the whole point. Watch the film while asking yourself, &quot;Is this scene a view of what 'really' happened, or part of the created myth?&quot; A friend, with more knowledge than I in such matters, tells me that there are many, obvious references to the great Soviet director Sergei Eisenstein. If you are looking for nothing but &quot;reality&quot;, I recommend _Band of Brothers_ instead. As for the romance, I'm usually very much against a slapped-together &quot;Hollywood&quot; romance, but it's well handled here and not a huge part of the story. Those who talk about it &quot;marring&quot; a large part of the film are prehaps seeing the romance as bigger than it is, hating the fact that it is there at all. Ironically, there were female snipers in Stalingrad and there has been a suggestion that the historical main character did have a romantic attachment to a female sniper. While watching, ask yourself if the romance appears in the &quot;realistic&quot; scenes or the &quot;mythical&quot; scenes...",Enemy At the Gates

372904,"I know that technically I am wrong on every count.  Joan Hickson is far closer to the character from the books than was Margaret Rutherford.  The T.V. series stuck far more closely to the plots of the books and the style of the books than did the MGM films.  And I know that, although they became great friends, Agatha Christie detested the films and thought Rutherford totally wrong for the part.Nevertheless, Margaret Rutherford had such charm and was clearly such an eccentric (as well as being an excellent character actress,) that I far prefer the generally maligned film series.  To top it off, Ron Goodwin's soundtracks were terrific.  It would be nice to see them on CD.  (Fat chance.)By all means, perpetuate the series via DVD, but PLEASE, MGM or Ted Turner or whoever currently holds the rights, issue the Rutherford films on DVD as well.The less said the better, however, about MGM's ill-conceived, ill-fated attempt to launch an Hercule Poirot franchise with Tony Randall.  And I LIKE Tony Randall.  I loved him in The 7 Faces of Dr. Lao, which, through some uncharacteristic burst of good taste, IS on DVD and which should be purchased forthwith.  When they actually manage to put out a deserving film, it is our responsibility to support the effort by buying it.  The book (The Circus of Dr. Lao) is 20 times better than the movie and should still be in print.One more thing and then I will shut up.  If you are a Margaret Rutherford fan, I strongly reccommend Mouse on the Moon.  Granted, Peter Sellers is AWOL, but ya got yer Margaret, ya got yer Terry Thomas, yer Ron Moody, Bernard Cribbens, John Le Mesurier, etc.  Ya got yer Richard Lester directing.

597141,"Jack the Ripper (David Warner) uses H.G. Wells' (Malcolm McDowell) time machine to escape justice and travel to 1979 San Francisco, with Wells in hot pursuit. That's the premise behind an entertaining film written and directed by Nicholas Meyer (Star Trek 2 & 4, The Day After). After a somewhat slow start, the film picks up once Wells reaches the future. Meyer shows acute awareness of how the real Wells might react in 1979 San Francisco: ever the inquisitive mind, Wells studies and learns as much as he can and never seems overwhelmed. After all, he was a visionary who wrote grand imaginings of the future; to a degree, he was already a man out of his time. The same is true for Jack the Ripper, who would feel more at home in our time (as stated in the film; in our time, he would be another Dahmer or Gacy). Simple things like that make this movie a cut above the average time-travel/fish-out-of-water film. It falls into convention at times, recycling some very familiar elements, but it still manages to entertain, thanks in large part to brisk direction and a marvelous performance by Mary Steenburgen as Wells' liberated love interest. McDowell and Warner are also good, and McDowell's performance is nicely restrained (given his occasional tendency to overact) in one of his better roles. I also liked the realization of Wells' time machine--very similar to how it is described in his book, but with a few tweakings to make it look a tad more ""realistic."" The special effects aren't great, but they are merely a sideshow to the plot. Also, some of the attempts at social commentary come across as preachy and heavy-handed. Never mind all of that. What matters here is plot and characterization. It's not a completely satisfying film, but it's intelligently done and engaging, with good doses of romance and suspense. An interesting speculation: Imagine the same film with Sherlock Holmes, or Thomas Edison, or Jules Verne transported to the future.",N/A
283231,"I have seen this film countless times to the point of having memorized the script. I'm not sure if such a ethnically centred character (though he comes out as moral giant compared with the rest) would ever be allowed in current stuffy PC Hollywood, so this will remain an inimitable classic. Seller plays Hrundi V.Bakhshi  would be indian actor - does dat include telvision sir? he asks -  Seller's Indian accent - as a specialist in east Indian impersonations myself I can recognize the talent -  is in my view the main attraction of the film. He's absolutely believable and the accent and intricate sophisticated and flowery english constructions typical of educated Indians are a contrast to the hype and flash of Hollywood.  After the kind of analysis that can only result from multiple viewing, i noted Sellers' character's salmon coloured tie to be a very important detail. It gets him caught - literally - in some of the key moments. also after such painstking viewing I find the very funniest line to come even before the credits appear. The laughs are constant however. The film also has some great music a morgan Three wheeler sports car and a big hat, that Hrundi V. Bakshi desperately wants back by the end of the film. warning, teh accent is addictive.

First I should point out that there are changes from the first movie. Just Mr. and Mrs. Little and thier sons George and Stuart Little are back along with both Monty (he is in a short part of the movie) and Snowbell are back.

Mr. Little (Hugh Laurie) and Mrs. Little (Geena Davis) allow Stuart to drive to and from school in his car, but his old brother George has to be with him. George now has a new friend named Will (Marc John Jefferies). And Stuart is lonely until one day when a bird named Margalo (Melaine Griffth) falls into his car on his way home from school.

535262,"Snatch is a fast-paced gangster thriller from England. Like many such British films, it is equal parts drama and black comedy. Our friends in the UK may take crime seriously, but they can't bring themselves to do the same with criminals. Perhaps there is a lesson for us there. I thoroughly enjoyed Snatch, but I must warn you that the accents can sometimes be hard to understand. The one used by Brad Pitt is intentionally indecipherable. Fortunately, I watched the DVD version, which has an option that puts subtitles on the screen whenever Mt. Pitt speaks. The video edition does not have this feature, but that doesn't matter too much. His dazzling performance is entirely physical in nature, so what does it matter what he has to say? The other characters don't understand him either.The movie was directed by Michael Ritchie, who is probably better known to Americans as Madonna's husband. His first picture, Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels, was also about psycho bad guys; in fact, Snatch is so similar to it that it is practically a sequel. The characters are different, but many of the same actors appear in both movies. Both films also share Ritchie's frenetic, stylish editing, as well as his fascination with lowlifes.The plot is so complicated that describing it is difficult. I had little problem following it, but several reviewers admitted to getting completely lost. Basically, the story is about a huge diamond that gets stolen from a jewelry company in Amsterdam. It bounces from one group of criminals to the next, and, of course, everybody wants to get their hands on it at any cost. Meanwhile, a boxing promoter is having a very difficult time with a vile, ruthless gang boss who is demanding that he fix a fight. This is where Brad Pitt's character, One Punch Mickey, comes in. He is part of a band of gypsies [thus, the accent] who are the trickiest double-dealing folks you are every likely to see. Soon, everyone is merrily out to get everyone else.The characters all have names straight out of a Damon Runyon story - Frankie Four Fingers, Bullet Tooth, Boris the Blade, Turkish and Brick Top are some of them. I think the names alone are enough of a clue that the movie is not to be taken seriously. One problem some viewers will have with it is that there are two or three times as many characters than in most movies. Keeping up with them can be a challenge.Snatch should prove to be great fun for those who love for a movie to be fast and innovative. For those who like them to be cool, calm and collected, another choice of movies is recommended.",Snatch

543612,"I am a Kevin Smith fan and have enjoyed the first four movies in the Jay and Silent Bob series.  I am also a frequent surfer of his ViewAskew website and read for months prior to its release about the fun that everybody had in making ""Jay and Silent Bob Strike Back"" and that this was going to be the best in the bunch.When the movie came out, I was one of the first in line to see it.  I have to admit that I was extremely disappointed and came out with the opinion that Jay and Silent Bob were best suited as support players and not lead characters.  I just felt that Jay was at his best when he chimed in here and there with a foul-mouthed smart-aleck comment instead of having to sustain it for 100 minutes.But I am a completest and since I have all of the other Kevin Smith movies on DVD, I had to make this purchase for no other reason to get the outtakes and to hear the director's commentary track.  Unlike most other commentary tracks where the director treats his movie like it is ""Citizen Kane"", ViewAskew commentaries are hilarious as the participants rag on each other, criticize Hollywood executives and some of the actors and aren't afraid to admit that a particular scene stunk.After a couple of different relooks at the movie, I have to say I like it and would rank it as the second best of the five (I unabashedly state that ""Mallrats"" is my favorite - although I'm probably the only one in the world who would say that).  It is a well shot movie, with great music and great performances by Shannon Elizabeth (she actually can act), Judd Nelson, Will Ferrell and most of all by Jason Mewes as Jay.  Cameos by Jason Lee, Ben Affleck, George Carlin (he's not washed up after all), Mark Hamill, Matt Damon and Deidrich Bader (from Drew Carey's show) were all enjoyable.My only criticism is that Chris Rock's cameo as an angry African-American movie director came off to me as extremely hateful and is a real turnoff.  I don't know the point that Kevin Smith was trying to make with that character, but he failed miserably, both at the theater and on DVD.This was a nice wrapup to the Jay and Silent Bob story.

708648,"This film is awesome.  If you like a good action-packed mystery/horror flick then you will love this movie.  It is the story of Mani and Fronsac two French/Indian war veterans who are asked to come to France to find and kill the invincible beast that is devastating a small French coutryside.  This film is not another mindless horror flick with a simple, formulaic plot.  It is very complex in terms of story and character motivations.  The characters themselves are all interesting and unique unto themselves.  Mani is an Iroquois Indian who fights like Jet Li.  The guy who plays Mani did a wonderful job.  I haven't seen so much charisma in an actor since Bruce Lee.  Fronsac is a naturalist/taxidermist who falls for a beautiful girl who is the daughter of the King.  He can also fight well.The best things about this movie is the story behind the wolf itself, the scenery and cinematography, the martial arts fighting (especially with Mani), the gorgeous women, and the camera direction.  The french subtitles didn't bother me at all but I might have to go see the film again because it was hard to follow sometimes.  It's just really complex, that's all.  It's also a long movie at a good two hours, maybe more.  I definitely wouldn't mind seeing it again.  It's the best action movie I've seen since the Matrix.

A small group of goofy government agents are sent to investigate a mass disappearance of the residents in a New Zealand town.  The disappearance is linked to a huge extraterrestrial fast food conglomerate which sets up shop in the town.  I shouldn't have to tell anyone what they put in the burgers.This is Peter Jackson's first movie.  As many of you know, he went on to direct Lord of the Rings, as well as the equally gory Dead Alive and the more mainstream but still great The Frighteners.  However, this film shows how well he was able to work with a far more modest budget.  Some of the effects and action sequences are impressive considering the limited resources, especially the chase scene involving agent Derek (played by Jackson) and an alien zombie (also played by Jackson).You should tell just by looking at the cover, which depicts an alien who looks like a Star Wars cantina reject flipping us the bird, that this is not to be taken seriously.  This really is not a horror movie as much as it is a comedy, an extremely gory comedy in which much of the humor revolves around the gore.  An example would be the hilarious scene in which Derek falls off a cliff and fractures his skull.  He literally has to keep his head together by tying his belt around it.Even though I can't recommend Bad Taste to all audiences, I truly think people who like Monty Python or South Park may find something to enjoy about it.",Bad Taste VHS

247876,"Post-Vietnam and post-Watergate, Americans back in the mid-1970's were, frankly, afraid. The world had turned upside down, and people were looking for something, anything, to say that we would be alright, or taken care of, or most especially, that we were not alone. Could we rely on a benign force of Nature, or God, or aliens, or other mysterious forces to save us? This fear and wonderment took the form of a blossoming interest in ESP, witchcraft, UFOs, Ghosts, Bigfoot, the Burmuda Triangle, and the mysterious magic of pyramids, King Tut, Stonehenge, and Easter Island. To fuel this public interest and acceptance of the Unknown, a new genre sprang up in film and television; the pseudo-science documentary. ""The Late Great Planet Earth"" is one of the earliest of these anecdotal, half-baked suppositions based on misread documents, bad science, and wishful thinking to justify its bizzare claims.Toward the end of his life, Orson Welles hosted a number of pseudo-science documentaries, and even had his own TV show about the mysteries that surround us (think, a low rent version of ""In Search Of""). ""The Late Great Planet Earth"" is one of these projects, and one of the better ones. In fact, it is actually one of the better examples of the genre.The production values are surprisingly good. The re-enactments are, for the most part, well handled. And of course, we have Welles, intimidating in his silvered beard and black suit, posing the questions of bible prophecy in that powerful voice. Certainly worth a viewing, even if you don't buy into bible prophecy.Of course the ""science"" here is worthless, and has been debunked a million times over. However, that isn't the reason people read Lindsey's book or watched this movie.The film is actually quite well made, so I encourage you to check it out. The opening sweep alone of Earth in space is a better-looking planet effects shot than any I can recall. And again, we have Welles.Pseudo-science documentaries died out in the early 1980's when the national mindset changed, and are deucedly hard to find today, especially on DVD. Perhaps it is a sort of national embarassment that keeps them from being more readily available, or perhaps the copyright holders of these films feel there is no value or profit in releasing them. This is unfortunate, for they need to be viewed, not only for comedy value, but as a window into the thinking of a past generation. After the events of September 11, the innocence and wonder on display in these projects is all the more poignant.",N/A
57448,"This well-meaning but flawed film purports to be about the life and times of Bruce Lee, the intense, talented actor and martial artist who died tragically all too young.  There is dispute over the biographical truth of the film, which is really neither here nor there, as the film seems far less interested in delving into Lee's biography than it does walking a strange line between drama and melodrama.  Though he doesn't much resemble the real-life Bruce Lee, star Jason Scott Lee tries hard to capture the actor's raw power and charisma, with mixed results.  He's best in the film's quieter moments, when the sincerity of his face gives the film much-needed grounding, and worst when his frenetic facial expressions and frequent shouting border on camp.  But this probably isn't Lee's fault, as the film itself drifts in and out of wanting to be taken seriously and wanting to be a pseudo-chopsocky matinee, all to an often-syrupy music score.  Co-star Lauren Holly is believable as Lee's caucasian wife, who struggles with him against racism that comes from so many in society--even her own mother.  It is here that the film works best, illustrating the humiliation and degradation of anti-Asian racism that Lee, who simply wants to be recognized as the American he is, endures from fellow Americans, even after achieving his fame.  A particularly clever--and dead-on accurate--scene reveals the isolation and thoughtless prejudice that Asian Americans frequently face:  amidst a crowd of whites roaring with laughter, Lee quietly suffers Mickey Rooney's grotesque yellowface characterization in the critically-acclaimed ""Breakfast at Tiffany's.""  Had the film focused more on meaningful emotional pyrotechnics like these, rather than the frequent, goofy interplay between Lee and a symbolic Mongol warrior, it might have captured the essence of the man instead of his onscreen persona.  Like ""Boogie Nights,"" it would have risen above the obvious exploitive qualities of its subject matter.",Dragon: The Bruce Lee Story

No need to mention Anthony Hopkins and Giancarlo Gianinni who are also perfect in their roles. I did not like the idea of replacing Jodie Foster with... Julianne Moore, but I guess the movie is so good, I'll have to forgive this mistake. Miscasting?

Well, as we all know, Hannibal Lecter is free and hiding somewhere in Italy. But one of his victims, wealthy Mason Verger is planing an elaborate scheme to get his revenge: trapping Hannibal Lecter to watch him being eaten by wild animals.I have to say the music is excellent, cinematography... wow!

This movie, like the book, is to ""The Lord of the Rings"" like a romance novel is compaired to ""A Tale of Two Cities"".  Sorry to say so Harry fans, but it's true.  Yes it is.

4123,"I won't bother to get into details of the stories, since that is already well-covered by other reviews on this site.This two DVD set includes ""The Murder of Roger Ackroyd"" and ""Lord Edgeware Dies"". The producers set these stories as taking place after previous episodes. This decision was probably made on account of how much older the actors look. While Poirot and Inspector Japp have aged gracefully, both Captain Hastings and Miss Lemon show their years.The Murder of Roger Ackroyd is one of Agatha Christie's most famous novels, but it translates poorly on the screen. It is impossible to go into details without giving away who the murderer is, but suffice it to say that the surprise of the novel is greatly diluted here. There is also a wistful sort of sadness that permeates the entire story, with none of the charm of the earlier episodes. There is also a feeling that the production was rushed, and that the actors feel uncomfortable in their roles.Lord Edgeware Dies is a much better production. All the old favorite characters are re-united here and some of the charm/humor missing in the first story is present here. There is also a greater sense of locale. This episode feels more populated and the variety of locations along with the complexity of the story helps keeps this moving along at an entertaining clip.If you have the opportunity to purchase the two DVDs seperately, definately choose Lord Edgeware Dies and forget about Murder of Roger Ackroyd.",N/A

As I recall, 'It's a Wonderful Life' didn't register on the radar at all in 1967 - were these guys on to something?Peter Cook and Dudley Moore, playing as a comedy team long past their 'Beyond the Fringe' days, showed up in a fair number of 1960s movies (also: THE WRONG BOX, THE BED-SITTING ROOM, THOSE DARING YOUNG MEN IN THEIR JAUNTY JALOPIES) but this film is clearly their own.In a perverse way, this film lifts me when I'm feeling down - the idea that one's fate is indifferently observed by Good and Evil is outweighed by the idea that one's fate is ultimately in one's own hands makes me feel the possibilities are, indeed, unlimited.Cook and Moore both died way too soon, but this film is forever. It addresses theological issues clearer than many 'serious' treatises.

484911,"John Cusack on the screen is infinitely watchable.  He teams up with director Stephen Frears (Grosse Pointe Blank) again for High Fidelity and the results are nothing short of entertaining.This adaptation of Brit Nick Hornby's novel sees the world through top five and top ten lists.  Cusack's character, Rob Gordon, is a man in progress, in fact a man in need of very much progress.  He owns a record store, works with two other man-boy vinyl purists (well-played by Jack Black and Todd Louiso), and refuses to be committed to any one relationship or any pursuit in life.  Cusack's latest love interest Laura, played by Iben Hjejle, is left wanting.  The acting is left wanting and the chemistry is left wanting.  The electricity is never very apparent between Cusack and Hjejle like that with Cusack and Minnie Driver in Grosse Pointe Blank.  But it's a minor flaw really.There are many funny moments here.  There are many hip moments here.  One of the hippest being Bruce Springsteen's cameo appearance dispensing sage observations while playing an incredible blues riff.  As Cusack goes hunting for someone to anchor his wandering soul, things almost rap up in the end in too neat of a package.  But the minor detractions really aren't enough to keep you away, especially with music as the common thread.  Needless to say we get to hear much good music as Cusack muses to the camera.This movie may not be Cusack's best, but it's right up there.

539820,"A man is found almost dead with two bullet holes in his back, but what is more mysterious is that when he regains consciousness, he finds that all of his memory is gone! A Swiss bank account number tattooed on this body leads him to discover he is Jason Bourne (Matt Damon) but no other facts are unearthed, except for knowing he has remarkable and terrifying talents. Besides finding out his name, he also finds in his Swiss box money, false passports, and a gun. With the help of a German gypsy, Marie (Franka Potente), he goes on a trail to find out his real identity. Unfortunately for him, assassins have a new target... him!""The Bourne Identity"" most certainly falls into the category of a spy thriller, a new venture for Matt Damon who is the star of the movie. Throughout the movie I was very impressed with his spectacular fight scenes, obvious that he had training in kickboxing, karate, and firearms, using the skills like a 'born' natural (no pun intended :). His acting is also well done, from his expressions, emotions, and even showing the lack of both. Franka Potente is also a good love interest in the movie. She displays both nervousness and strength in her character. Other notable stars are Clive Owen, Chris Cooper, and Julia Stiles, though their roles are very small.Of course the movie has spectacular action and fighting scenes, mesmerizing you throughout the film. From car chase scenes and foxes and hounds chases to hand to hand combat fighting and gun fighting, you will be tense with excitement and suspense! One of the interesting things about the movie is the car chase scene. Well, we all have seen probably numerous car chase scenes with the hero in a cool sports car, Matt Damon as Jason Bourne drives a mini cooper! Now that was interesting! But some of the fight scenes are a bit violent, especially the end, hence the PG-13 rating.The movie is not all action, there is actually a pretty neat plot! The story is based on Robert Ludlum's 1980 bestseller so you can rely on ""The Bourne Identity"" having an intricate plot with lots of twists and turns. But one thing that disappointed me was the conclusion. The end was a bit confusing, making you wonder what in the world had been going on? Maybe it was me or the ending didn't seem to make sense. But I think the filmmakers are just making way for the sequel which I expect since ""The Bourne Identity"" is only the first in a trilogy. The other two sequels are ""The Bourne Supremacy"" and ""The Bourne Ultimatum"".So, if you are looking for a movie with lots of action and thrills, I highly recommend you ""The Bourne Identity"" which I'm sure will satisfy!",N/A
708584,"This film is a masterpiece, taking what fairy tales were long before the Brothers Grim, Disney and other sanitizers changed them for children and bringing it to us in beautiful detail.Nothing is more horrfying than the unknown and one of the best things about this film is that they keep you guessing through most of the picture and they do not dumb it down. (Unlike Tim Burton's Sleepy Hollow which took out 90% of the suspense and made the film almost boring while we waited for Ichobod Crane to catch up with us in the audience.)It is witty, intelligent and so much better than most American films being produced today.Many of my friends found this film to bloody, as someone who HATES bloody films I did NOT find this too bloody. There was one objectional scene for me and that was brief. This was no means a blood bath film but it is VERY dark and is not some clean hollywood film where the good guys don't sweat or bleed.I had two problems with the film and they are personal issues:1.

The wolf hunt was horrible to watch if you are at all fond of animals, however as it was not a REAL wolf hunt and was what people would have done back then I found it less objectionable than the dead shepardess scene which was just a little too gross for me.Also the soundtrack is superb and fits the movie to a T.Go see this film or buy the DVD-Video when it comes out and you will be amazed!",N/A

But, unfortunately, the portrayal of the central character, Baron Frankenstein, is off when compared to other entries in the series, particularly high-points like ""Curse of Frankenstein"" and ""Frankenstein Created Woman.""In those films, there was something twistly heroic about Frankenstein... one almost finds oneself hoping he'll succeed. But here, he is just a vicious killer, a brutal rapist, a creature with no redeeming qualities safe for the inherent charm of Peter Cushing, the actor who portrays him.The tale has Frankenstein blackmail a crooked doctor at a local asylum into giving him access to a mad scientist soFrankenstein can cure the madness through brain surgery. The corruption of Frankenstein and the crooked doctor spread to engulf the doctor's otherwise innocent fiance. On the very night of Frankenstein's seeming triumph, everyone ends up paying for their crimes, including Frankenstein himself.The ""morality play"" aspect of this film works extremely well. What doesn't work is Frankenstein's completely monstrous nature. And it's made worse by the brutal rape he visits upon Victoria Carlson (who gives what is probably her best performance in this film). It's a shame really that the central character should be so off in the way he was written.",Frankenstein Must Be Destroyed VHS

(Is it Hollywood's skittishness about Hopkins playing one of the greatest Christian writers of the 20th Century?).This was an emotionally-shattering film to watch, a love story that reaches so much deeper than anything I'd seen before. I NEVER cry at films (came close with SCHINDLER'S LIST and THE ENGLISH PATIENT) but SHADOWLANDS pushed me over the edge. I remember watching the audience leave the theatre: they shuffled out with shell-shocked expressions, everyone looking deep into themselves. The parents of two sisters I took called me the next day to ask what we had seen (the girls went home and had been strangely quiet).I'd read C.S. Lewis' theological books for years but had no idea of what his personal life was like, so SHADOWLANDS was a wonderful insight into his life.(My only problem--and from what I've read of people who knew him--is one single line at the end of the film: ""I have no answers--only the life that I've lived.""

548552,"A critic named Pauline Kael has once said that there are such things as good trash and bad trash when it comes to movies. Her theory could certainly be proven under ""Dragoon"", an anime so goofy that since then NO SEQUEL's been made to follow up with it, even though the story is not yet completed. From the dubbing to the animation, nothing is pitch perfect, but it could be worth a chuckle or two, and it makes for great fanfiction material.""Dragoon's"" story is one of the oldest stories of all time. Basically, Sedon, a young man with an aging father, must now carry on his father's skill and courage to survive the future. That future arrives to him in the form of a lost and beautiful woman, who doesn't remember that she is part of an evil plan, and therefore many villains want her. Along the way, the young man must protect the woman through his healer sister, a lance-wielding prince named Lain, a fiery beaut named Lilith and her trusty knife-wielding assistant.That's about where the differences end. The animation is corny, nothing as skillful compared to Digimon or anything from Clamp. But there's a ton of nudity included in this one. The shiest character, the woman May, has a nude scene almost every 10 minutes!!! If that doesn't get your noodle nutty, read this; Sedon's sister and Lilith also bare their bums too. This is a guilty-pleasure anime that's just ambrosia to anime nerds who dig naked women in a medieval setting.You want violence? There is some, especially some graphic explosions and swordplay with blood shooting everywhere. But it's very tame compared to the nudity, which no doubt is the explanation for the anime's +17 rating.The characters can be good for some, bad for others. Let me explain. The characters have hardly a mite for any development. They are often involved in predictable situations (e.g., sibling rivalry, uneasy inheritance of power) that you've seen before not just in anime, but in ""Dawson's Creek"". My favorite characters are Lilith, Sedon's sister and Lain. I couldn't gather much info, but I think Lain and Sedon's sister make quite a couple. I wouldn't mind Sedon and Lilith, but I have no idea who May really is. She's not a character, just a plot point that will have men leering at her from all angles.Maybe you folks could spare a view of ""Dragoon"", but if you really like it, be warned; there's no sequel made for this story. Then again, why don't you conjure your own sequel? That way, you could imagine all the nudity that you want.",Dragoon VHS

587085,"Bergman, Fellini, Kurosawa, Kubrick, Welles. A week ago, I would never have thought to have included David Lynch among these visionary masters. But then I purchased the DVD for &#65533;Mulholland Drive&#65533; on a whim (something I rarely do for films I&#65533;ve never seen). I sat one night in front of the flat screen in my LA home, put the disc into the player, and was held captive for two and a half hours by a work of startling cinematic genius. It was, like all great films, a work that haunted me for days afterwards; a work that I wanted to immediately share with those closest to me -- but only those who would be willing, and able, to work through a very difficult film to the harrowing truths that glowered beneath the surface like a brilliant blue light.There are many good filmmakers. There are some great filmmakers. But those handful who are considered true masters, true geniuses of the cinema, all share one trait: they adhere almost religiously to the idea of film as a Visual art form. Simply put, they allow the images, and the arrangement of those images, to tell the story. They aren&#65533;t content, as most mainstream filmmakers are, with allowing a linear written narrative to wholly dictate the visual presentation of their films. Rather, they respect the raw, organic nature of an idea, they allow that idea to spread its roots, and they cull the images and the sounds together that will bend to the inclinations of that idea. Thus, these films, like &#65533;Mulholland Drive,&#65533; do not follow the simplistic but comforting A-B trajectory of most films, which are usually nothing more than cinematic renderings of novels. (Film and Literature are equally important artistic mediums; but the masters understand that they are essentially very distinct animals and should be treated as such.)And so it is that &#65533;Mulholland Drive,&#65533; like Bergman&#65533;s &#65533;Persona,&#65533; Fellini&#65533;s &#65533;8 1/2,&#65533; and Kurosawa&#65533;s &#65533;Rashomon,&#65533; decidedly turns traditional linear narrative upside down and inside out, and does so gleefully. Lynch&#65533;s film is like a prolonged fever dream of the most intense human emotions: paranoia, anger, grief, jealousy, remorse and a soul-wrenching despair. It is a work that transcends its film noir underpinnings and becomes, ultimately, an incisive examination of Hollywood as &#65533;Dream Factory&#65533; and of the troubling implications that arise from our unquestioning willingness to embrace its position as such. Lynch seems to suggest that our willingness to surrender to the &#65533;dream&#65533; that is Hollywood makes us complicit in the crimes that Hollywood then commits to further sustain that &#65533;dream.&#65533; And he doesn't exclude himself from this complicity (the brash young filmmaker Adam Kesher is arguably a self-parody).I will not discuss the specifics of the plot because I think that would be a true injustice for those who have not yet had the privilege of working through this masterpiece. All I will say is that of all of the films from all over the world that I have had the honor of taking into my mind and my heart, few have shaken me as much as &#65533;Mulholland Drive.&#65533; I cannot emphasize enough how brilliant Naomi Watts&#65533; performance is in this film. To even call it a performance seems like an insult. I have rarely, if ever, seen a young actress so fully inhabit the skin of her character as Ms. Watts does here. Her character arc in this film is not simply A to B to C. It is more like BA to AB to C, and what a heartbreaking C it is. Those of you who have seen and understood the heart of the film will know what I mean.Mr. Lynch and Ms. Watts, if you are reading this, one lowly cinephile salutes you.",Mulholland Drive

He admires and wishes to learn from a rich, successful capitalist rather than someone who has foresaken worldly goods in the service of the poor, for instance, or a prisoner of conscience in some gulag somewhere. The wine list is terrible in those places and anyway, death knows what 'The Stranglers' know, that is, it's only the children of the wealthy that tend to be good looking.

The industrialist is played by Anthony Hopkins who obviously seems to view himself as an elder statesman to such an extent that he barely appears to be in the picture. He is smug and avuncular and you expect him to break out into a royal wave at any moment. Rather than lend a hand to some poor peasant whose about to have their land taken away from them by a tyrant, death lends a hand to a walking dollar sign in a less than scintilating boardroom battle that is supposed to have us laughing and cheering. Death is a bit repugnant, it seems.Slow and long, the director fancies this as his 'Being There', only you get Pitt instead of Sellars. Pitt is gorgeous but looking at that face for three hours is like gorging on a box of chockies. Too much of a good thing makes you want to throw. Death bends his own rules and let's a very good looking man go on living, presumably because blood on such a sharp suit may ruin any future job interview as a male model. We can't have that, can we? As the fireworks explode and the camera pulls back on a scene of outdoor opulance, we are reminded that it's a hard life for the privileged in letting go. No longer will they be able to watch films which make them feel good about being American. I mean, death loves America. He loves low cut dresses. If I should meet Joe Black, I'll know what to say. &quot;Lend us a fiver, Joe, the lights have gone out and I need to feed the meter.&quot;",N/A
178682,"Ahh, what is there to be said. After watching both as soon as I got the DVD from Amazon, I find that I am completely dumbfounded at Scott's choices of cuts in the director's edition. The first half was magic as only true fantasy storytelling could be in every aspect except the music (which I'll get to later). However, after the setting moves to Darkness' keep, it becomes apparent why Scott made the cuts he made in the first place when Legend was first theatrically released. The standoff between Darkness and Lili loses its edge and tension with the director's cut and becomes something akin to dinner conversation with a new date. This is symptomatic of the entire second half, as the director's cut loses the cohesiveness and pacing of the original release with alot of unnecessary and out of place scenes and dialogue. Yes I understand that such scenes were meant to add to each character's development, but I think Scott failed in that regard here. In the first half he was successful, revealing for the first time Jack's ability to speak with animals and such, but in the dramatic second half it just gets in the way and interrupts the drama and action. And Darkness' father has a really annoying voice now too.As for the music, I really was disappointed with Goldsmith's work, which has been superb in other movies. It was not nearly as emotive as the TD score nor as unique and supportive of the scenes. Specifically, the TD score was far superior in the black dress dancing scene a waltzy dance number with a hint of discord and evil whereas the Goldsmith score was a dance, rather light and breezy which of course did not fit at all. And he botched the ending! The original ending was nearly perfect, and he completely deviates from it. But oh well, I have to go to work, hope this helps.",N/A

More of a prequel than a sequel, this movie is about a Mexican outlaw who kidnaps an executioner's daughter and finds himself chased by soldiers, criminals and, of course, vampires. The ending is very cool with the action staying pretty solid. A fun hour and a half of nonstop action and humor.",From Dusk Till Dawn 3: The Hangman's Daughter
113334,"So many films in my collection are &quot;important&quot;, &quot;serious&quot;, &quot;disturbing&quot;, or &quot;great&quot;, and as much as I treasure them (films like Citizen Kane, Vertigo, and Ran), there is only so much self-importance a person can take before the pores fairly scream out for something just plain fun;  something slight, buoyant, silly, and full of energy.  Singin' in the Rain is just that kind of movie.  The funny part is, I generally HATE musicals!In 1951, Gene Kelly and Stanley Donen took a collection of songs by Arthur Freed and Nacio Herb Brown and - assisted by a pitch-perfect screenplay from the writing team of Adolph Green and Betty Comden - sculpted one of the great classic fusions of popular cinematic art and precision dance craft.  It is the Citizen Kane of musicals: a virtual catalog of musical film technique, executed flawlessly.But that alone would not be enough to separate Singin' in the Rain from the kind of musical I can't stand (which is to say, just about every other musical ever made).  No, what makes this one special is that it knows what it is and celebrates it.  It never for a moment asks you to forget you're watching a movie and then grinds to a screeching halt for the musical number.  Instead, it deconstructs itself before your very eyes (and ears) as a razor-sharp, self-aware satire of the movie industry - as well as a joyous expression of the pure ecstasy of great song and dance.  In that sense, it is one of the few so-called musicals that actually achieves a genuine symbiosis of drama, music, and kinetic performance art.If all this sounds rather gushing and pretentious, so be it.  This is great film-making.  It is Rolex Oyster Perpetual film-making.  This DVD edition sparkles with ultra-saturated colors, digitally remixed Dolby 5.1 sound, and some terrific extras (even if you're not particularly into musicals).My favorite sequence is the eerily fluid dance work between Gene Kelly and Cyd Charisse against a Dali-esque background near the end of the film.  Charisse is spellbinding as she trails a gravity-defying veil that must be 30 feet long.  It hangs in the air, suspended by wind machines as she uses her extraordinary dance skill (and fantastic legs) to affect a wordless seduction of Kelly's naive, love-struck hero.  Great stuff.Even if you don't think of yourself as the &quot;musical type&quot;, give Singin' in the Rain a try.  After all that heavy, bitter, existential cinema, it makes one helluva fine dessert.",N/A
496987,"I didn't see this film when it was in the theatre, despite urging from friends to do so. I didn't because Hollywood's approach to stories with racial themes is usually so politically correct as to insult the viewer's intelligence (which is demonstrated by my buying the DVD, rather than paying $5.00 for the matinee ticket?). This is a well made movie with an excellent cast. The interaction between the German POW Camp staff and the prisoners is excellent - taut and dramatic. The racial bias of the white enlisted men vs. the black Air Force officers is also realistic, and because it is not sanitized, it comes across very well. Good films are ""good"", because they draw the viewer into the story; one becomes a viewer, through the camera, of the plot, and often loses the sense of ""watching a movie"". Older films have less of this characteristic, I think, because stylized camera and acting techniques of that time detract from the viewer becoming totally immersed in watching believeable action. This movie brings the viewer into contact with characters and plot from the outset, and never lets go. Bruce Willis has come a long way from the ""Die Hard"" days, and is more convincing because of his matured talent. The rest of the cast perform very well. It's a very enjoyable, yet thought provoking experience.",Hart's War
526961,"In Short:Pros1: Jackie Chan has the perfect part in this movie, very believable role for him.2: Pretty clean humor you could watch it with the family (even the Indian peace pipe scene does not expressly state it's marijuana).3: Excellant chemistry between Chan and Wilson.4: Yes there are fight scenes here but not much blood at all.Pro or Con:1: There are fewer stunts and fight scenes than in some other Chan movies and they tend to be more in line with what you see in other movies at times.  For some this is a good thing for others not but it's still got some good action sequences to go with the comedy.ConsNothing significant really.I'm a fan of Jackie Chan's so it's no wonder that I liked this but I also think it is one of his better movies.It's a pretty good take on a standard plotline involving the good guys saving the princess and works very well as a vehicle for the humor and stunts we get with most any Chan movie. Chan and Wilson have good on screen chemistry and create an endearing image of a likeable cowboy want-a-be and a Chinese immigrant come from the emperors court to save his princess.I thought the scene where Chan is befriended by a local Indian tribe after saving one of the chiefs daughters was one of the highlights but I do kind of wonder what an Indian would make of it (it involves Marijuana and some interesting conversation subtitles). Man Who Fights In Dress is instantly liked by the Indians even though no one can understand him.Owen Wilson's character is a contemporary take on the American cowboy and old west opportunist. He equals Chan on the humor side perhaps but not on the stunt end, that is Jackie's show through and through. The standard out takes and bloopers are at the end but are shorter than I've seen on other Chan films, whether there was fewer of them or what I don't know. It's a very small part of the product of course that does not detract from the film.I would not say this is Chan's best movie for stunts necessarily and the fighting choreography has been better in other pictures. What I rate this film so highly for is the overall pace of it and the flow of the movie. This is one of those movies that seem to fly past even though it is in fact a standard length picture leaving you wishing there was more.It's really very good in my opinion.",Shanghai Noon

Moulin Rouge is an indulgent mess, with a few wonderful sequences and performances (most notably by Ewan McGregor and Jim Broadbent, both of whom are quite good) Personally I am mystified by the film's appeal.  Kidman and Leguizamo are both way over the top, the story is much too simplistic and the dance sequences are unfocused and dull.  I would very much like Luhrmann to take a look at an earlier film of his ""Strictly Ballroom"" and take a lesson from it.

The only people that have given this movie 1 star was because they were anti-war fanatics and just want to downgrade war in general. This movie is very realistic for the most part, absolutely action-packed, and will have you sitting on the edge of your seat from the second that the fighting begins.On the other hand, like a lot of American war films...this movie is extremely biased towards the American side of the story, not to mention the fact that it also only focuses on the American troops fighting...and not the Pakistani and other troops helping the UN side. It also portrays the Somalis as heartless people, when they were no more heartless then the Americans fighting.All in all, it is still a great movie, I'd recommend it to anyone that isn't weak of the heart.",N/A
26154,"The title of the review makes this film seem like paradise, but as soon as watch it you will find that it's not.  It's basically a darkly humorous and daydream filled movie about government becoming too controlling by using fear and paperwork (lots of paperwork).  It is inspired by '1984', but it doesn't plagiarize because there are significant differences between the two and the most important one being that 'Brazil' isn't humorless like '1984.' Although the director is American he used to be in a Brittish comedy group called Monty Python, you may have heard of them. I say this because the film has very Brittish feel to it because many of the actors are Brittish (Michael Palin was even in Monty Python).  The production design also has the outlandish feeling of animation because the director mostly did the humorous animation bits for the movies and series for Monty Python. This shows up in many models that were built for this movie.  Most people can't get past this, but if that weren't enough the screenplay was co-written by Tom Stoppard who loves to do dialogue that includes language jokes that I think many Americans won't find funny.  Add to that the fact that it's 2 hours and 22 mins long.  Most won't be able to make it past all of that.  A friend of mine said that the film bored him even though he thought it was visually brilliant.  In my opinion the film needs that amount of time in order introduce you not only to this wacky and dangerous world, but to the dreamworld of the main character and how they become increasingly difficult to differentiate.  Despite all of these 'setbacks' it isn't a smart film and it doesn't take multiple viewings to understand the film, people just enjoy it and were willing to go through the 'setbacks' that other people can't get past. I personally don't even find it difficult to watch at all and enjoy revisiting the world that 'Brazil' offers, or least the one that Sam, the main character dreams up.Also, I must note that the DVD features have just as many 'setbacks' as the film because they are very comprehensive. There are the usual things such as the trailer and the promo documentary, but there are other longer features as well.  A long documentary about the trouble the director had with getting Universal to distribute his film is included as well as long text explanations of the development for the script. Storyboards and many others are more than most can take, but if you're a student of film and find this one fascinating, then this is the best place to look.",N/A

The whole identity of the killer in &quot;CUT&quot; is actually absurd and ends up turning the movie into a bad episode of Nickelodeon's &quot;ARE YOU AFRAID OF THE DARK?&quot;  or &quot;GOOSEBUMPS&quot;. The identity of killer was a let down. The acting, however, was actually good for this type of movie..but the script needed some work (there are too many cliche one-liners at the end..especially by Molly's character). Also, the killings and gore were quite good and stylish. The only problem I have is the plot..and identity of the killer. Instead of making it 82 minutes, they should have fleshed it out more, creating more of a background on the characters. There is a &quot;secret&quot; that we find out about on the the main characters but it's just spoken once and it just doens't make sense that no one would know about it before.

111107,"Stephen King's bestseller SALEM'S LOT is a surprisingly complicated novel that first presents a detailed portrait of normal life in a small New England town--normal life that is gradually perverted when the town becomes infested by the undead.  And with a cast that includes such memorable performers as James Mason, Lew Ayres, Elisha Cook Jr., and Marie Windsor, this 1979 two-part television special seemed to a great deal going for it.  Unfortunately, however, director Tobe Hooper and his screenwriters are unable to find a way to streamline the novel's numerous characters and subplots into any dramatic whole, and the result is a film that constantly references a host of characters, events, and ideas but seldom to any real effect.Even so, the film does have its charms.  Chief among them is James Mason in one of his final performances, offering a brilliant, sinister, and wickedly witty performance as Mr. Straker, the servant of the vampire.  Ayres and Bedelia are also extremely good, and although Cook and Windsor are largely wasted they are nontheless entertaining to watch.  And the film does offer a few ""jump in your seat"" thrills: the scenes of child vampires floating outside bedroom windows are truly creepy, and the great vampire himself harkens back to the silent film NOSFERATU in a most effective way.Still, most viewers will find the film fairly tame.  David Soul was not a memorable actor, the script is incredibly talky, and there are too many lose ends for the story to be satisfying.  It will be of most interest to fans of King's work who would like to see how television handled this, one of his most successful novels.  A word of warning: there are two versions of this film.

292911,"Rating: +4In the eighties, Evil Dead was a moderate success for director Sam Raimi & somehow managed to gross $2,400,000 upon it's initial release in the U.S  even though the budget was only $375,000. Despite mixed reviews from critics, the film has since managed to acquire a dedicated following as well as two successful sequels. (Horror writer Stephen King gave the film massive props in a November 1982 issue of Twilight Zone.) Not only did the sequels do exceptionally well, the films have all received multiple re-issues on DVD & several re-pressings through various distributors. Probability suggests that Evil Dead's popularity will remain a constant & this film's devoted followers will always cite this first entry as being their absolute favorite.Within the past few years, Evil Dead has also been made into an off-Broadway musical production with the approval of Bruce Campbell & Sam Raimi.Although Evil Dead 2 works well as a sequel, I've always considered the film to be a re-visioning of the first low-budget classic only this time Raimi had more moo-lah-ah to play with. Even though there are sure-fire elements of horror present, I'm not REALLY sure I'd call it a straight-forward horror flick as it's way too goofy to be taken seriously. Having said that, there's plenty to love here & more reason to re-visit Evil Dead a second time. Need I say that the laughs come as fast as the gore??How gory is Evil Dead 2? The film is unrated which means it wasn't submitted to the MPAAbecause it surely would have gotten something more than an R), and in fact inspired the distributor (De Laurentiis Entertainment Group, founded by Dino De Laurentiis) to create Rosebud Releasing for this one film. There are plenty of decapitations, zombies, supernatural demons, and plenty of gore to satisfy the blood-thirsty nuts like myself who simply can't get enough of it. Oh, yes there will be blood. Buckets.For some odd reason, Ash (played by Bruce Campbell) seems to love taking weekend trips with his girlfriend to this evil little place in the woods. You would think he might've learned his lesson after dealing with those demons from hell in the first entry & decided to take up golf as a hobby or maybe find another vacation spot. Instead, he would rather do battle with these evil minions in a haunted cabin once again. Some guys never learn I guess.Evil Dead 2 picks up immediately where it's predecessor ended. Ashley takes his girlfriend on a seemingly romantic vacation back to the cabin in the woods. All is well until Ash begins to play a recording of Professor Knowby's incantations from the Necronomicon (roughly translated ""Book Of The Dead"") & the trouble immediately starts up again. As once can probably guess, the recorded passages unleash an evil force which takes possession of Linda's body & Ash is forced to either kill her or be killed.I could go into further details here for you but why kill the ultimate experience? As anyone who has seen this entry or any other Evil Dead film an tell you, the proof is definitely in the pudding. What becomes of a terrified Ash & is it really possible to kill Linda? If Ash can bring himself to murder the girlfriend, will she stay dead? Will Ash ever escape this nightmare in the woods or will he find himself the catalyst in a series of grotesque encounters with the demonic world?Evil Dead is often touted as being a zombie flick by it's fans or cult following. While there are elements of the film which do remind us of zombie flicks, I've always seen the film to be about demonic possession. I will even go so far as to say I've seen countless threads or postings online where people have debated this for many years. At any rate, it's an entertaining flick & that's all that should matter.

589377,"In his first English language film, ""Heaven"", German director Tom Tykwer abandons his earlier displays visual pyrotechnics, fast cut editing, and adrenaline laced pacing, to present us with heart felt meditation on the nature of unconditional love. This may disappoint some fans of his brilliant trilogy of films (""Night Sleepers"", ""Run Lola Run"" and ""Princess and the Warrior"") which explored the themes of syncronicity, metaphysics and causality. It is the blissful performance of the cameleon-like actress Cate Blanchett that allows Tykwer the space to breathe and expand his artistic vision.""Heaven"" begins as a thriller involving a woman obsessed with avenging the death of her husband, but quickly shifts gears and becomes an exploration of love between doomed outsiders, another favorite Tykwer theme. Tykwer shot the film in Italy and it is technically a bi-lingual film, because much of the dialogue is in Italian. Giovanni Ribisi, whose career has alternated between lackluster and compelling acting efforts, presents a starkly well crafted perfomance of an Italian policeman who becomes obsessed with Cate Blanchett's school teacher character. The langorous pacing of ""Heaven"" allows us linger on the voluptuous camera work of Frank Griebe, Tykwer's brilliant cinematographer. Griebe's sensual, impressionistic lens has become the trademark of a Tykwer film.In his last film, ""The Princess and the Warrior"", Tywker gave ample notice that he was maturing as a director, and was becoming more concerned with character development over technical gimmickery. Many of Tykwer's younger devotees may point out logical flaws in the script or find the film's more tender moments absurd.

This is the kind of movie I think women can get their football loving husband to watch.",French Kiss VHS
450424,"THE ACTING WAS GREAT, THE STORY A BIT ONE SIDED:Gwyneth Paltrow and Jean Tripplehorn do an excellent job pulling off duel roles for the same character in this romantic/comedy/drama. The leading men are equally charming in both their particular ways. (Tongue in cheek here).  The story line is creative as well, but more could have been done a little less extremely.  The characters are very one-sided and could have been more creatively handled.BASIC IDEA, WE ALL WONDER WHAT IF:How many times do we have an opportunity to have an insignificant event play an important point in our life, that we don't even realize the significance.  This was the fundamental thrust in the movie.  Timing.  What forces out there guide (or not) our lives?  How much is chance and how much is destiny? If you believe the director/writer in this story, only one path works.  This was the part I didn't like.BASIC STORY:Gwyneth Paltrow's character is involved with a two timing boyfriend, who's lack of character and overbearing mistress dominate both their lives.  Due to a minor change in timing one version takes Gwyneth's character out of his life.  In the other scenerio, she falls prey to her unconfirmed doubts.  Both of their lives continue and the story ends at another crossroads.  I can't say more without giving it away.  However, I think the director, could have handled it a bit more creatively and even handedly.DARK VERSUS LIGHT:The comedy is dark in some situations as you see how manipulated and domineered Gwyneth's character becomes by her situation, while remaining in the louse of a boyfriend's life.  Ironically, the darker scenario, her hair is dark.  And the lighter (kind of) scenario, her hair is light. In this situation once she gets on with her life with another man, the comedy is light and whimsical.  A bit too obvious however.  The drudge versus the successful working womanHATED SOME OF THE ENDING:The only major flaw I find in the movie is the ending.  This was a bit too much.  Is this the directors punishment for all the strong determined woman out there, who have dumped their louses?  What were you thinking?  Shame on you.It was an interesting movie that was at time a bit predictable at times but enjoyable none the less.  One wonderfully hysterical part of it was the dialogue between Jerry and his (sympathetic?) mate at the bar.  How many louses expect sympathy for their situation.  This guy was for real.  Also, the British humor was wonderful.  What does bollux mean?",N/A

This is a gorgeous, action-packed film that has all the right Anime elements. If you are a fan of Japanimation like ""Ghost In The Shell"", then you MUST see this movie. The story centers around a secret organization and one of their top super-powered agents, a ""Spriggan"", who tries to stop another secret organization from exploiting the hidden power behind Noah's Ark.This is a great looking movie, the blending of CGI and cell animation was done so one style did'nt overpower the other.

596391,"In the year 2054 the Justice Department has set up it's first Precrime unit in Washington DC. Through the visions of three psychic ""precogs"" who can see homicides before they actually occur, members of the precrime unit (precops) can arrest people before they commit murder. Murder has literally become non-existent in DC.Chief of the Precrime unit John Anderton (Tom Cruise) believes in the system 100%. Six years ago his son disappeared and now he pours himself into his work in hopes of preventing what happened to his son from happening to others.It makes no sense that Anderton's name comes up in the system as a murderer-to-be. He desperately tries to prove his innocence, but if this premonition is a lie, then the system he believes in and lives by is a failure.I don't predict any awards given for this film. However, credit must be given to the brilliant creativity and vision of director Steven Spielberg. I noticed definite influences from the late Stanley Kubrick here. This future world that Spielberg creates is extremely well thought out and detailed, some real brilliance here (I can't say too much). This is a typical role for Tom Cruise. Max von Sydow wonderfully plays Cruise's boss, Lamar Burgess, Director of Precrime. This is a fast-paced film, not just with action, but also with dialog, ideas and new concepts. It doesn't leave you in the dust, though. Everything comes together nicely.",N/A

664432,"""opera"" is one of argento's most memorable films, again not because of the needlessly excessive and at times just revolting violence, but because of the real fear and terror that the mysteriousness of the killer generates and his twisted relationship to the 'protagonist' female who he physically and mentally terrorizes. obviously this has nothing more to do with realism than any of argento's other movies--i seriously doubt the killer could get this girl with these things on her eyes THAT many times in all those convenient situations he happens to successfully stalk her in--but this goes without saying for his fans, including myself, and does not bother me. the fascinating thing is the comment argento is making on our relationships to one another and how they are, no matter how superficially convincing the facades may be, not what they seem, and are often rooted in depravity and brutality be it of a mental if not physical kind.what takes away from it, though, is the horrendous and ultra cheesy soundtrack that argento pasted on the film. it's really bad heavy metal that has no place in any of the scenes, and if you didn't know argento, you'd think that it was a deliberate joke or partial parody on the part of the director. that's him, i guess. lots of odd idiosyncrasies, the laughable soundtracks being the more harmless one.for those who have a taste for the campy and demented, ""opera"" is another argento treat.",N/A

556536,"""Don't Tell Mom the Babysitter's Dead"" is an all-time comedy great. It shows that when you work hard and work together how you can get something done. When Sue Ellen, Walter, Kenny, and Melissa's mother goes to Australia for the summer they are left home with a babysitter. She's not any ordinary babysitter, she's and old lady that is rule oriented and is very, very strict. The kids decide that they have had enough and when Sue Ellen, the oldest of the kids, goes down to talk to her, she is found dead. They have no money and Sue Ellen is working for a clothing company for the summer. Thus starts a funny and often touching comedy.At the beginning of this film, Sue Ellen has a bad attitude, along with her siblings, about their whole summer. Sue Ellen gets a high position in the clothing company by submitting a made up resume and the job is tedious and very hard. As the movie progresses, she is developed into the young woman that she really is and disovers for herslf how she can accomplish things. She's not the only one that changes. Her brother, Kenny, is a delinquent at the start of the movie as he hangs with the wrong crowd and is off every night using drugs. By the end of the film he changes into a courteous young man that has respect not only for the people and things around him, but for most importantly, himself. The whole family works as a team during their summer and at the end of the movie you know the signifigance of hard work and effort among a group.The comedy in this film is very good and you'll be having a belly laugh every few minutes. This is a comedy that is great for the whole family to sit down to and enjoy. It is funny, touching, and gives great messages. Not many other comedies can do that. this is heartily recommended to the lover of a great comedy or a film with great messages.",N/A

683476,"For starters, if you have seen or read Shakespeare's Othello, then you already know what happens in this film. With that in mind the filmakers have done a good job adapting it into a realistic present day tradgedy.Odin is the star player of his prep school basketball team, he is popular, dates the girl of his dreams, the coach loves him like a son, and colleges are fighting over him. So what is the problem? The coach has a son, Hugo (sound familiar?) that wants his dad to love him like a son. He does everything his father asks yet Odin was still the MVP. All he wants is a little appreciation. Too bad they didn't give it to him. So angry is Hugo that he unleashes the largest double-cross since Iago double-crossed Othello. It is too good to go on. Lets just say for a while it goes as planned.There are several major hang ups with this film that can't be overlooked. Unfortunatly some of them are plot spoilers so it would be wrong to go into them. However, this film does raise an interesting question about society, especially our youth. How long should we let people go before we ask is everything okay? See the film and you will understand.The acting from the young cast is solid and the film looks great. The all rap soundtrack was a little out of place, but it did serve well in some dramatic moments. The story is very solid, but don't forget, Shakepeare really wrote it. And on an additional note, anyone who is affraid this film is in Shakepearian English can relax, it's not.Problems aside, this film is worth a watch. I say read Othello first, but then it will give away the plot. Still the comparison is interesting and the filmmakers did a good job making it contemperary.",O

82593,"Don't get me wrong, this is an excellent dvd set, but...There are moments that make me wonder, is this all really necessary?For instance, the film looks good. Very good. Too good. There is not a flaw to be seen, no specks, no dirt, no dust. Nothing. It's simply too clean. I get this horrible feeling sometimes that I'm not watching the original film, but a remake!Yet the restoration is well done, and the colors are simply phenominal. This is how the film must have looked the first time it was shown.There are many bonus materials here, almost all of which are excellent. The lost scenes are fascinating, the additional music and film materials are interesting, and the development ideas are well presented.Then comes the scariest moment of all - a history of the Disney company.It starts off well enough, and we get to see all the artistic acheivements that happened in the 30's, 40's, 50's, and 60's, but when we get to the 80's, it gets scary. We basically have a laundry list of everything the Disney comapny owns, parks, baseball teams, hockey teams, boats, and on and on. I was waiting for Angela Lansbury to pull out the deed to the country. What was sad was how blunt the presentation was of what is basically corporate propaganda. It ruined the spirit of the whole set for me, as I realized that these dvds weren't made to celebrate art, they were made to celebrate the beginning of a corporate monolith.Ah well, the rest of this set is great, and by buying it, I've increased stock values.Enjoy!",N/A
61836,"""Hindenburg"" is a pretty good film that unfortunately falls a bit flat. The concept, sets, effects, and the cast are all excellent, but there just seems to be some element missing.The cast is populated with famous faces from yesterday, a standard practice in all 70's disaster movies. Here we have the incomparable Gig Young, Burgess Meredith, Charles Durning, Richard A. Dysart, Robert Clary (late from ""Hogan's Heroes"" at this point), future Star Trek actor Rene Auberjonois, and Roy Thinnes. And of course, we have Anne Bancroft and George C. Scott. Scott and Thinnes really do their best, too (look at their confrontation scene when Thinnes' character mentions Scott's dead son!).Still, the cast just seems to be shuffling through this one, with little or no true tension generated, other than an emergency repair by some crewmen who must venture out onto the hull of the ship (an act that was accomplished, but never happened on Hindenburg's last trip).The end result is somewhat sparse, even strangely emotionless for the most part. Despite the overall blandness in tone, the film is compelling to watch anyway (thanks in large part to the cast and the effects).Knowing as we do what will eventually happen at Lakehurst, one cannot help but marvel at the ironic line the Hindenburg's Captain Proust utters several times throughout the course of film. In regards to the United States' bad luck with dirigibles he remarks, ""It's no wonder they lose all their airships.""The ending of the film seems to mystify some viewers today, but it is, in reality, an incredibly artistic, stylish (and daring), choice on the part of director Robert Wise and the producers. Capturing the action in black and white, with actual newsreel footage of the disaster added, and freezing images in place, Wise makes a stunning montage of the disaster and of the cast members as they flee the impending peril. Even though the end result is only partially effective, the montage makes an artistic statement nevertheless, the kind that Hollywood avoids today. With noisy garbage like ""XXX"" and ""Ace Ventura"" littering our cineplexes, it's nice to know that at one time in the recent past, there was room in Hollywood for some creative and bold artistry in films! Would that it could become fashionable again!An interesting side note here is the night time launch of the Hindenburg. The ship is lit with searchlights that create odd, circular patches of light on the airship's hull. Five years later, Wise directed the critically panned ""Star Trek: The Motion Picture"". In that film, the Starship Enterprise is lit in a similar fashion, with spotlights on the ship's various insignia that create pools of light from odd angles.",N/A

578627,"There's trouble down at Malibu Beach in the early Sixties. Sensible Florence Forrester has begun to ignore her trueblue friend Burdene in favor of ""that sleazy beach crowd,"" a group of young surfbums who have taught her to ride the waves and renamed her ""Chicklet."" Florence suffers from strange spells when she's not herself, and becomes a tough femme fatale named Ann Bowman, ""dominatrix-empress of the planet Earth!,"" who likes nothing better than to enunciate her own name melodramatically and to shout orders at her male sex slaves. Florence's mother, a Joan Crawfordesque control freak, won't explain what's up with her troubled daughter. Meanwhile, some of the surfers in Florence's crowd can't seem to keep their hands off one another. And a strange killer is slaughtering people all over the place, striking largely at the physically imperfect...Charles Busch's successful off-off-Broadway stage play gets the full treatment here and is largely very successful. Very wisely, Busch, who played Chicklet onstage, stepped aside in favor of young Lauren Ambrose, later to be the star of HBO's ""Six Feet Under,"" and cast himself instead as the police detective, Monica Stark, investigating the murders. Monica is such an &uuml;bercompetent butch detective (with strangely thoughtful facial expressions) that everything Busch does or says is funny. Ambrose tries a bit too hard as Chicklet, but she's quite hilarious when she becomes possessed by the Ann Bowman persona (don't be surprised if afterwards you start reciting some of Ann's better, and more arch, bon mots: ""Bad boys need to be spanked... bad boys need to be TORtured!"").

520203,"There are not enough words to describe what Peter Jackson and his team have made to bring to life one of the most amazing stories ever told. There are thousands of thoughts, impressions, reviews and many kinds of things said about Tolkien's wonderful story. In my opinion, his tale is not jus about good and evil, but a recreation of the story of christianism, where there are martyrs willing to sacrifice, symbols to be feared and proteceted at all costs, a company of friends almost like apostles, making a pilgrimage to a distant land where evil is supreme.Peter Jackson was brilliant choosing to make three movies in one, and to film them all at once. Each part of the lord of the rings has a depth that of its own, and to condense the story in only one movie would be a disastrous crime. Either the story would have to be mutilated, or the movie would have to be twelve hours long. With three movies, there is enough space and time for everything in Tolkien's imagination to be brought to life and, which is better, accurately.The visual effects are simply fantastic (the Balrog being the most amazing one), worked on to the last and smallest details.New Zealand is a wonderful country and the right choice for the photography and photography effects, like the famous scene of the two stone-figures guarding the entrance of the river.The casting was appropriate also, a blend of old and proved talented actors and the new generation of stars of medium shine.Ian McKellen is, again, superb as Gandalf. Cate Blanchett and Liv Tyler are the beautiful ladies of the elven. Viggo Mortensen and Elijah Wood do their parts very well.

200586,"Noir fans may exalt Detour as the best cheapo road movie in film history, but the non-noirish Duel certainly has it beat in the suspense department. This is a tour-de-force of direction and editing that stretches a scanty plot into a breathless 90 minutes of edge-of-the-seat entertainment as Mann (man) duels tanker to the death. And where could the producers have located one of filmdom's scariest monsters?-- that rusting leviathan that could only have come from 18-wheeler hell. The movie itself confims what many of us only suspect: that heavy machinery operators should be psychologically tested before being loosed on the road.

Man wins because his more highly-evolved brain and agility will always best clumsy bulk and strength.

722127,"It's funny that ""Buffy the Vampire Slayer"" is already in its seventh season, when there was a time it didn't seem as if the show would even last seven episodes.  Only recently  (very recently) has ""Buffy"" finally started to lose steam, in terms of ratings, core fan loyalty, and critical acclaim.  The long-overdue DVD release of Season 3 should be a welcome reminder of what ""Buffy"" was like at its artistic and popular peak.  Season 2 of ""Buffy"" shattered all sorts of dramatic rules and managing to remain hilarious and poignant all at once.  Season 3 keeps rolling with the punches and duplicates those successes.We begin with a pair of episodes easing Buffy back into life in Sunnydale, after her traumatic exit in ""Becoming"".  ""Anne"" is a careful character piece, reintroducing Buffy to her relevance in the larger world, through a trip through Los Angeles' demon dimensions.  In ""Dead Man's Party"", a host of zombies comes to town and wrecks Buffy's house, just in time to salvage her disastrous homecoming party.""Faith, Hope and Trick"" is the first great episode of the year.  Faith, the new second Slayer, is introduced, as is Mr. Trick, the  season's first recurring villain -- Pimp Vampire Daddy.  Also along for the ride is Scott Hope, Buffy's human rebound boyfriend.  And, of course, Angel returns to life.  In ""All Men Are Beasts"", Buffy weighs her new boyfriend against the feral Angel, and Oz fights Sunnydale High's resident Jekyll/Hyde monster.The season arc continues in ""Homecoming"" and ""Band Candy"", two funny episodes which introduce Sunnydale's off-kilter Mayor (the witty Harry Groener).  A darker hint of things to come arrives in ""Relevations"" -- the first serious cracks in the prickly Faith's emotional armor, and the first hints that Giles will not be Buffy's Watcher forever.  This episode ends on a frustrating emotional disconnect between Buffy and Faith, and while this was unusual upon first viewing, in retrospect it's a powerful moment, fraught with the tragedy to come.""Lover's Walk"" is one of the season highlights, as last year's villain Spike returns to town.  It's amusing that all the regular characters suffer some defeat in this story, but Spike drives out of town singing along to Sid Vicious and obviously back on top of the world.  It'd be another year before he'd return, but Season 3 is, happily, strong enough to overcome his absence.""The Wish"" is Buffy's first look at alternate history, as Season 1's villain, The Master, is momentarily resurrected and a battle-scarred alter-Buffy can't quite defeat him.  In ""Amends"", billed as ""A Buffy Christmas"", it's Angel's turn to be redeemed from his past.""Gingerbread"", ""Helpless"", and ""The Zeppo"" are in a sense the last three stand-alone episodes of the series, which soon afterwards would roll over into more of a continuous soap-opera storyline.  That said, ""Zeppo"" is memorable for its Xander's-eye view of Sunnydale High, and in ""Helpless"", Giles is finally fired by the increasingly ominous Watcher's Council.Faith takes a screaming left turn toward the dark side of the Slayer force in ""Bad Girls"" and ""Consequences"", two of the rawest  hours of the season.  The ending of this two-parter reveals Faith's betrayal of Buffy, which in a sense stings more than Angel's conversion to evil the year before, because it is voluntary.In ""Enemies"" and ""Choices"", the Faith/Mayor Wilkins relationship develops.  The father/daughter chemistry between the season's two remaining villains sets them up among the pantheon of great ""Buffy"" baddies.  In between are two great solo episodes -- ""Dopplegangland"" (the one with the Evil Willow) and ""Earshot"", the first of two stories so raw and timely that it was yanked from the air due to its eerie prefiguring of the Columbine High School murders.  Oddly, ""The Prom"", a very funny hour, was spared this fate, even though it treads similar grounds.  The ""Class Protector"" trophy awarded Buffy is another of the show's finest bittersweet moments.The year ends with ""Graduation Day"", the culmination of the Faith and Mayor Wilkins storylines, and the final hours of the Scooby Gang as students at Sunnydale High.  Pay close attention to the final battle scene -- many recurring characters have their ultimate fates revealed in brief flashes way from the main action.While Season 4 of ""Buffy"", the next set due out (eventually), is terrific, Season 3 is for many the final year in which the show was, quite simply, perfect.",Buffy the Vampire Slayer - The Complete Third Season

Personally I found Enid to be despondent wreck, hell bent on lambasting others for their perceived injustices (read: success).  The parade of foil characters that attempted to sharply contrast her persona only reinforced my belief that not only was she clueless and without direction, but that she was simply melnacholy because she did not fit in.  Her acerbic demeanor, lack of depth or any altruistic conviction only proved that she wasn't motivated by a cause or struggle.  My belief is that her perpetual effort to rub popular culture the wrong way was in some way a combative response to not fitting in.  On that level this work was a mild success.

It's about three love-lost women (Cher, Pfeiffer and Sarandon) who, bored with small town life, shack up with The Devil (Nicholson) who offers them a world of sex, magic and enjoyment.  However, things soon begin to start spiralling out of control, and by that I mean the movie as well as the three girls' situation.It's not that the acting is bad.  Far from it, each member of the cast is perfect, especially Sarandon in an unusually sexy role.  The problem is that the movie can't balance its menacing elements with its funnier ones.  Much of this problem lies with Nicholson, who constantly is forced to move from scary to fun-loving.  Whilst the four leads are floating above a swimming pool or playing a magical game of tennis it skips along quite nicely.  However, this is all blown away with a ridiculously over-the-top finale which seems to waste all the movie's money on some very silly special effects.Still, Susan Sarandon in a funny role is a treat to behold.",N/A

I followed the script without much trouble.Have heard that some viewers didn't understand the film. Well, I don't know how much education those individuals have.....And the criticism of Aaliyah's character/acting. There was nothing that I could see that merited any such criticism. Her character was that of a African Goddess, a queen who was the most powerful of her kind. She had a relationship with Lestat__Which might be the reason why many felt ""uncomfortable"" with this movie. The relationship was in context with the storyline therefore I felt nothing was out of line there. But if it makes anyone feel better, she was evil, betrayed by those she trusted and was destroyed at the end.But she will return again!! And will avenge her betrayal.I would recommend this to anyone who is looking for good entertainment. It is typical vampire violence and may be a bit scary for younger viewers. But it is viewable.Let your hair down and enjoy it!!!!",N/A
701881,"I was thrilled when M*A*S*H season two was FINALLY released.  Afterall this season has the classic episode titled ""Five O'Clock Charlie"".  Just like the previous season we get 3 disks with 8 episodes on each disk for a total of the full 24 episode season.  (M*A*S*H had 24 episodes per season instead of the normal 13).  Other than scene and episode selection you get no special features which is fine and dandy with me since seeing the un-cut episodes of one of the greatest shows of all time is special feature enough.The ONLY problem period is Fox's release schedule.  The little piece of paper that the set came with said ""Continue Your Collection With Season 3 AVAILABLE WINTER 2003!"" 2003? Are they kidding me?  I need to get like Father Mulchahy and calm down and pray.  But that is an insane amount of time to wait.  I could see Winter 2002 but 2003 is just WAY to long for me.  Fox needs to get back on track here.At least we can watch M*A*S*H about four hours a day (if you have no life) since its on a lot.  I f you are a fan you need to own this set at almost any cost.

She plays a wide variety of characters that shows off her dynamics as an actress.The look of this movie is amazing, from the stunning imagery in the opening sequence (with the flower being crushed by the army of laborers going off to work), to the paradisiacal island where the volcano of the title is located.This movie is funny.

For Your Eyes Only brings 007 back to Earth from Moonraker and downplays the gadgets in this film. The new villian is Aristotle Kristatos. He is sophistically played by Julian Glover. He has stolen the ATAC system and with it, has a serious advantage in destroying any submarine! The new Bond girl is Melina Havelock. She is avenging the death of her parents at the hand of a hitman, Gonzalez hired by Kristatos. The music is fantastic in this film!!! Sheena Easton sings a melody that you just can't get out of your head! The only downpoint in this film is the missing appearance of ""M"" and the ridiculous dialogue between Blofeld and 007.

147268,"It's Jim Belushi's acting that saves this film, yet his character is too dumb to be credible, as is the premise of the film.  He's a vicious corrupt cop who doesn't check anything twice, just shoots and doesn't ask any questions--later or at any time.  Yet because of Belushi's strong acting talents, his character is almost believable.He and his partner, played by a wildly overacting Tupac Shakur, have a nasty profitable scam going:  they set up trades with drug dealers, then kill the latter for the drugs which they can sell again.  Here's another problem--any money cops use for set ups has to be authorized by higher ups, then accounted for.  There's no mention of that in the film; how do they get away with keeping the money?  It's also mentioned that they've pulled this 11 times.  OK, so after all those times, NOBODY on the force investigates how it is that so many drug dealers have died after a set up put in place by the same two cops over and over?  Also not credible.The two thug cops kill a drug dealer who turns out to be an undercover DEA agent and fellow DEA guy Gary Cole pulls in and starts hassling the precinct for answers.  Cole also overacts here; he's a caricature, not a character.However, as an upscale attorney, James Earl Jones does a fine job, as does Dennis Quaid as a surprising suspect the thug cops have framed for the murder of the DEA agent.  Yet the surprise that comes with discovering Quaid's real identity is another plot point that severely strains credibility.The film seems to be a collection of characters thrown together to flesh out a collection of random, often non-credible, and distinctly unrelated story segments that have not been thought through.  Even the ending is disappointing--you can smell it coming a mile away.In spite of all the above, this is not a bad film because the pacing and momentum are strong enough--along with the acting of Belushi, Jones, and Quaid--to carry it through to its predictable end.  Belushi is on screen most of the time and he's a lot of fun to watch.  You're thinking no cop can be that dumb, but his acting chops make you feel that if a guy could be this crude and vicious, then, OK, maybe he COULD be that dumb.A truly mixed bag.

The relaxing music, narration, and beautiful scenery of California's Death Valley will calm your mind.  While the challenging yoga routine will release tension in your muscles.  Patricia Walden's yoga routine mainly consists of lunges and balancing poses focusing on stretching the legs and back muscles.  Other yoga postures include child's pose, dog pose, proud warrior, and forward bends.  The balancing poses are difficult and challenging, and I was struggling to maintain my balance.  But I feel energized and more relaxed after I complete this routine.My only COMPLAINT with this video is that she does not hold the poses very long for a thorough stretch and the routine seems a bit rushed. In a yoga class, you would normally hold a pose for 2-3 minutes.  However, this video is advertised as a brief yoga workout.  If you want to simulate or replace yoga class with a video, this is NO replacement.  However, it is a great video for people with hectic lives because it is easier to make the time for a 20-minute video versus a 50-minute video.DISCLAIMER:  After reading a few other reviews, I think there is some confusion about what a ""beginners"" video should entail.  If you are excessively overweight, obese, or have any serious health problems--you should consult your doctor before beginning any new exercise regime.  Even though this tape says for ""beginners"" on the box, your health will determine your ability to complete any fitness program.

708016,"After hearing how bad Queen of the Damned was, I was somewhat surprised by how I enjoyed this film overall. It isn't in the same ballpark as the great Interview with a Vampire, but on its own it is worth it to watch.Among the problems it has is the lack of character development for all the main characters, including, to a lesser extent, Lestat. As that vampire re-awakens to become a rock star, we never get a real good sense of who he is, and why he's &quot;coming out of the coffin&quot; and revealing himself as a vampire to the world, a big no-no. But he's got more characterization than the queen of the damned herself, as well as his sort-of love interest, who wants to become a vampire.The pacing of the film also is off, I'm assuming because the plot is taken from a number of Anne Rice novels, not any one in particular. Though I never read them, I could feel the schizophrenia in the film and it made me wish they would have narrowed the plot down to one book.But despite these major flaws, there is still a good deal to appreciate. The world it takes place has the right, spooky atmosphere a good vampire film is supposed to possess, much of the cinematography is visually exciting, and the queen herself, when the rage takes her, is quite an exciting sight.Overall, this film has as many weakness as it does strengths, and it's unfortunate it's not better. But it's not as bad as many critics make it out to be. Worth at least one viewing, especially if you love vampires.",N/A
26264,"You're not smarter than everyone else for liking, or like me-loving, this movie. I admit that no one I have lent my copy to has yet liked this movie, and that's too bad (but thay are no less intelligent because of it). Years and years ago when I worked at one of those BIG video stores (which I will not name here), I used to try to talk people into taking back the movie they had selected in favor of Brazil. If they seemed reluctant then I would simply ruin the ending of the movie in their hand, and then assure them I was saving them time and money. The job was really boring, so I had to keep myself entertained. No one ever complained though...That aside, the movie is really stunning. It's the theatrical equivalent of a Dali painting, at least in theme. Terry Gilliam has done some impressive things in film, but this movie, at least to me-and some others- is a masterpiece. With out a doubt it is bizarre, and the fantasy world of Sam Lowry is only slightly less bizarre than the reality this movie asserts. Its first rate satire, as only the British can supply it(yes I know Terry is from the states, but he's pretty much an honorary brit), with a love story that doesn't need to be believable for this movie to work. There's so much social commentary, that for it's time was ahead of it's time: a child asking Santa for a credit card for Christmas, Sam's mother and mothers friend trying to one-up each other in plastic surgery. Outrageous. Why can't Hollywood make movies like this? Fight Club was a good effort, but it tried too hard to be cool, and somehow tainted the over all quality of that film (which is not the point here). The Robert DeNiro cameo was so unexpected that it felt like a cavalry charge, and it worked so well because that's what his character represented.The movie meanders on from one daydream to another, one bit of faux-reality to another, until it becomes difficult to tell one from the other. Its bleak landscapes are quite intentional, and serve well to crush the viewer with the monstrosity of modern living. Quality of life becomes a real question as the movie takes you through its paces, and caters to ones deepest anxieties about life in the near-future. But to say this movie is depressing does it little justice. At times it can be uplifting. It's just not Hollywood fluff spoon fed to you, which is ironic being that the consumer is the hand that feeds them. A mutually parasitic relationship perhaps? Who can say...I could still watch this movie many times over, and really regret not to have been able to see it in the theatre, where movies get their best treatment anyways. Still I try to get others to enjoy this movie as much as I do, but it seems destined to be a cult classic, which to me has so many negative connotations. So buyer/renter beware. But I really don't think this movie should be a source of elitism, which also has its own negative connotations. I myself am an idiot, and still I love this flick, so maybe there is hope for the world yet!",N/A

703129,"What do you get when you mesh unblinking eyes, priests with webbed fingers and innkeepers with gilled throats, fishermen with a strange affinity for covering their faces, plenty of gold from the depths of the sea to go with the atypical ""bounty from the deep,"" a few faces getting peeled off to teach someone a lesson, a bit of octopi legging to replace those pesky bipedal ones, and one ancient tentacled God? No, it isn't your local barnyard sock-hop taking place at some yokel fairground, its Stuart Gordon's latest creation, the Lovecraft inspired Dagon!Unlike many of Gordon's earlier, more goofy approaches to the horrific, this Shadows Over Innsmouth/Dagon recount wore a dark overcoat that shrouded almost all of the production. The tale begins with Paul (Ezra Godden) and his girlfriend Barbara, accompanied by two friends, as they toast the success of their new company off the coast of Spain. Paul finds himself plagued by dreams of the foulest sort, ones dealing with an underwater monument bearing a strange insignia and a half-fish/half-humanoid woman, the type that end with him awakening (once again) in a pool of sweat and screams. Soon after our introduction, a storm, if you can call the suddenly conceived, quickly overwhelming beast darkening the sky and tossing their boat around like a bath toy ""a storm,"" impales their boat upon a black reef that any Lovecraft fan will well appreciate. This, in turn, injures one of the boat's occupants and forces them to seek help in a decrepit fishing town called Imboca. As they approach the town in their cheaply construed rubber lifeboat their woes begin, with the sound of gunfire coming from the ship and something brushing against their raft and knocking a hole in it. Is this sign of something to come? Well, in a world where the beasts run rampant in the water, you bet it is. The two quickly find themselves in a town that first seems deserted, a place where the churches read ""Esoterica Orde De Dagon"" and the occupants, once they are finally found, seem to grow odder and odder by the minute. All these things come together and finally lead them toward secrets that no Bostonian before them ever really wanted to learn, the truth behind the worshippers of Dagon.Touting nice effects in the monster category, some decent acting (Godden reminding me a lot of Jeffrey Combs, a great thing in my book), pieces of comedy to go with the more horrific, Deep One inspired portions of the movie, and some nice looking DVD quality, this is something to pick up and watch a few time. I highly recommend it for those who've always wanted augmentation by making deals with the oddities of underwater worship or for those simply wanting to stroll the beaches of human suffering as casual passerbys. It'll give you more reasons than the mere shark to stay away from the ocean.",Dagon

Slowly, members of the cast and crew begin disappearing, indicating the killer is still lurking in the halls of Crippen High.The killer did not do enough slashing, he should have had a stab at this cliched script. All the film makers' characters have been done before. The director is all artistic frenzy, the producer is a sleazy scumbag, the screenwriter is ignored, and the actors are shallow.

This plays like rejected scenes from ""Harriet the Spy,"" as they happen on a conversation, whip out a notebook, and nod and write.

One problem I've had with all kinds of computer animation is that everything comes out so clean.  This animation takes the time to dirty up it's characters a little bit, providing more realism, which I like.The movie's also terrific in that it does work at both the adult and child levels.  The kids will like seeing some of their favorite fantasy characters in another context.  While they may have less than pleasant personalities in this movie, I don't think that's going to emotionally scar our nation's youth, and the adults can enjoy the many zingers that get thrown in.But the familiar characters take a back seat to the brand new creations of this story.  Eddie Murphy as the donkey is great, if standard sidekick material.  But the animation of the Shrek character is more enjoyable with each viewing.  We've had slobs as heroes before, but never has such delightfully rude behavior been so incorporated into a lifestyle.  How Shrek brushes his teeth, catches fish for dinner, and provides a candle to light his dinner table are done so well they may become the new way of polite society.Well, maybe just in the movies.

The scary thing is that Enough actually featured a talented cast, with Juliette Lewis, Noah Wyle and yes, even Jennifer Lopez, yet none of them were watchable, the performances were uninspiring and boring.Let's face it, domestic thrillers have been done numerous times before, unfortunately Enough didn't do anything new to set itself apart from the others in the same genre.

217584,"In the ranking of American playwrights Clifford Odets is usually placed in the second tier behind Eugene O'Neill, Arthur Miller, Lillian Hellman and Tennessee Williams.  His output was something less than theirs and his two best-known plays, Waiting for Lefty and The Country Girl, never quite reached the artistic pinnacle of say, Miller's Death of a Salesman or Williams's A Streetcar Named Desire.  Nonetheless as a movie The Country Girl is a brilliant piece of work thanks in part to a fine adaptation by director and screenwriter George Seaton (Oscar for best screen adaptation, 1954) and sterling performances by Grace Kelly, Bing Crosby and William Holden.  Seeing this for the first time I was almost as much impressed by Holden, who played a part very much in keeping with his character and with other parts he has played, as I was by Kelly and Crosby who both did 180 degree turns in type-casting.Grace Kelly won an Oscar as the faithful, strong-willed, bitter, dowdy co-dependent wife of crooner Crosby who played a whimpering, guilt-ridden alcoholic.  You have to see Grace Kelly in the bags-under-her-eyes make-up and spinster get-ups to believe it.  She looks at least ten years older than her 25 years with a sour puss of a face and an attitude to match.  I think she won best actress (over Judy Garland in A Star Is Born) partly because her appearance was so stunningly...different.  (While I'm musing, I wonder if this was the film of hers that was banned in Monaco.)  It would seem to be the height of creative casting to put her into such a role, yet she is excellent, wonderful to watch as always, her timing exquisite, her expression indelible, and her sense of character perfect.  When she says to Holden, ""You kissed me--don't let that give you any ideas,"" and then when we see her face after he leaves, loving it, we believe her both times.Bing Crosby too is a sight to behold in what must have been his finest 104 minutes as a dramatic actor.  He too played way out of character and yet one had the sense that he knew the character well.  He was absolutely pathetic as the spineless one.  (In real life Der Bingo was reportedly a stern task master at home--ask his kids.)  Clearly director Seaton should be given some of the credit for these fine performances.  When your stars perform so well, it's clear you've done something right.The production suffers--inevitably, I suppose--from the weakness of the play within the play. Crosby is to be the star of a Broadway musical called ""The Land Around Us.""  (What we see of the musical assures us it's no Oklahoma!)  He's a little too old and stationary for the part, but of course he sings beautifully. (Painful was the excruciatingly slow audition scene opening the movie with Crosby singing and walking through a thoroughly boring number.)  Holden is the director and he is taking a chance on Crosby partly because he believes in him and partly because he has nobody else.  Naturally if Crosby returns to the bottle, everything will fall apart.What about the nature of alcoholism as depicted by Odets?  Knowing what we now know of the disease, how accurate was his delineation?  I think he got it surprising right except for the implied cause.  Crosby's character goes downhill after the accidental death of his son, which he blames on himself.  Odets reflects the belief, only finally dispelled in recent decades, that alcoholism was indicative of a character flaw, as he has Crosby say he used his son's death as an excuse to drink. Today we know that alcoholism is a disease, a chemical imbalance.  Yet Odets knew this practical  truth (from the words he puts into the mouth of William Holden's character): an alcoholic stops drinking when he dies or when he gives it up himself.  It is interesting to note that as a play The Country Girl appeared in 1950, the same year as William Inge's Come Back, Little Sheba, which also dealt with alcoholism.  The intuitive understanding of alcoholism by these two great playwrights might be compared with the present scientific understanding.  (See for example, Milam, Dr. James R. and Katherine Ketcham.  Under the Influence: A Guide to the Myths and Realities of Alcoholism [1981] or  Ketcham, Katherine, et al.  Beyond the Influence: Understanding and Defeating Alcoholism [2000].)Here's a curiosity: the duet song (best number in the movie; Crosby sang it with Jacqueline Fontaine) has the lyric ""What you learn is you haven't learned a thing,"" which is what the alcoholic learns everyday.And here's a familiar line, cribbed from somewhere in the long ago: Fontaine asks Crosby aren't you so-and-so, and he replies, ""I used to be.""",The Country Girl VHS

He falls in love with a girl named Mary, they get married, (I warn you, don't try some of the antics he does.) and George becomes a banker. His business runs short on money and he tries all he can to get it booming again, with a few obstacles along the way. On account of a guardian angel, George gets to see what the town would be like without him (Hey man, why wish that in the first place?  NEVER feel discouraged.)  But it all comes to a happy ending, with the full company on screen.Try this classic for yourself.",N/A

331215,"I bought this video after using Gin Miller's Best of Step Reebok TV workout.  These two videos are very different.  Whereas the Best of video is informal with a lot of vocal interaction and silliness among the steppers, this video reminds me of Orwell's &quot;1984.&quot;  The background steppers are nameless with blank expressions. Gin Miller is among the steppers counting down moves with hand signals while the instructor is Miller's face on a TV screen.  The steppers seem to be stepping on metal grating with light shining from below.  A live African band provides the pumping music.  The setting is very industrial.Whereas the atmosphere is a little intimidating, the workout is not.  The moves (including arm movements) are very simple and are done with a lot of repetition.  The first part of the workout I would classify as beginner/lower intermediate (one can always add propulsion, of course).  After the heart rate check, the workout gets a little more heart-pounding with a challenging lunge and straddle combination.The last segment of the workout includes 3 sets of pushups,lat pull downs, and ab crunches.  The ab crunches seem a littleskimpy for me (about 4 different crunches at only 8 reps each with rests in between.  I usually do crunches straight through).A good workout that is not too challenging but also doesn't leave you feeling that you cheated yourself.",Step Reebok: The Video VHS
660410,"Marshall Thompson is the sole surviving member of the first expedition to Mars (in 1973  -  Americans were very optimistic, in 1958), and the second expedition is bringing him back to Earth for court-martial on suspicion of having turned Alfred Packer to survive the harsh Martian clime.  Thompson's story is that an unseen Martian animal killed his men.  (Pfft - !  Who hasn't heard that one, before?)  It isn't too long before the second ship's crew believes him, however, because Thompson's never-glimpsed beastie has hitched a ride back to Earth with them, and is an especially violent killer...This was the inspiration for the much more famous Alien, twenty years later, and surprisingly is almost as good.  The production is imminently cheaper, of course, but that hardly matters.  The Martian monster (stuntman Ray ""Crash"" Corrigan in a fairly convincing zippered rubber suit with especially nasty claws) is pretty ghastly and near-indestructible, and creative use of light and shadow enhance its menace.  The cast perform with conviction, and are generally more believable than the standard stock characters usually attached to this sort of thing.  The effective soundtrack is lifted straight from the preceding year's almost equally good sci-fi B-flick, Kronos.",N/A
215685,"This masterful adaptation of Joseph Conrad's Heart of Darkness is an intriguing look into the mind confronted with madness.  As Martin Sheen's Cpt. Willard tells us, the story is about his journey as well as about Marlon Brando's Col. Kurtz.  The story takes place in Vietnam and Cambodia during the war rather than in Africa.The scenes Coppola gives us are unnerving.  The way Brando fades in and out of darkness, and eventually Sheen, creates in us an almost physical response to their touch with madness.  Are these characters mad or are they giving a sane reaction to the madness in their surroundings?  Everyone is trying to survive the horror of the war, but by embracing that horror, these two characters somehow make some sense of it themselves.This is an intense film, and I highly recommend it.",N/A

Jackson loses everything and is hell-bent on revenge.

695415,"You know, I normally have no use for romantic comedies--let alone romantic comedies that revolve around quasi-obscure cultural traditions--but this was--I must admit--quite good.  This is largely due to the fact that its creators saw fit to insert some actual *comedy,* rather than just the cutesiness which typically passes for humor in these affairs, in spite of not being at all funny.  The fact that the characters are, by and large, well-drawn helps too, and including the cab driver (the only one in London, apparently) as a central, unifying figure was a good idea that worked.  I cannot help but compare Born Romantic to Sidewalks of New York, a film I hated (two stars was a bit generous, methinks).  That film was also an ensemble piece examining multiple relationships, but it got bogged down in its self-satisfied smugness, never allowing the charaters to actually be people.  This, on the other hand, does; it has a relatively unaffected charm that made it a highly enjoyable experience (of course, it also didn't hurt that it appealed to my inner anglophile either).

504869,"*I cannot really ''praise,'' per se, the originality or story of the film ''Virus,'' because, in all honesty, it's not what anyone can rightly call a great film. Sure, it's visually stunning and fun and enjoyable and all that... but it's certainly not ''Terminator'' or ''Aliens.''Even so, I'm somewhat puzzled that so many reviewers are having a difficult time ''relating'' to this movie, based upon how it plays itself out. I think they are missing one key element in the whole thing, however:Just as ADULT reviewers have to be reminded that ''Santa Claus Conquers the Martians'' was a movie made for the tiny tot audience, reviewers of the movie ''Virus'' need to keep in mind that this film was based on a ''comic book'' story (...or as ''fanboys''-- current and former --would call it, a ''graphic novel'')!Anyone who pays any amount of attention would realize that there is NEVER (or rarely ever) going to be a ''totally straight'' presentation of a comic book story translated to the big screen -- even if the story itself is treated ''seriously'' within the pages of the comic. (''The Crow'' was one of those rarest of exceptions.)Keeping that in mind may actually make viewing this movie about an alien energy lifeform that....??? uses human bodies for ''spare parts'' ???...., and tries to kill them off more effectively by constructing cybernetic monstrosities???.... okay, so it's a little ludicrous, but again, I don't think it was meant to be taken completely seriously -- it's mindless escapism that's both fun and scary.

What I liked most about this movie was allll of the secondary characters... Kyra was the PERFECT Older sister looking out for her younger one, Gena was Great as the Southern Belle Mama, the Aunt (don't know this woman's name)was HILARIOUS as the ""little"" crazy Aunt that would/could go there. You really have to pay attention to this movie there are so many innuendos and funny moments that I truly can recommend this one. The actress that played the daughter was wonderful and last but not least Dennis Quaid did quite a convincing job as a contrite husband (once he was caught).If you want something along this plot line I would also suggest ""Hope Floats"" which also stars Gena Rowlands and has pretty much the same subject matter but not the same movie.

417441,"This was a brilliantly frustrating film about a confused man named Howard Campbell (Nolte), a brilliant if ill-fated playwright who led an ambiguous life for an American in wartime Germany.  Recruited as a deep-cover allied spy, Campbell ingratiated his way into the inner circles of the Nazi high command, then passed his secrets to our side through special coded messages.  Unfortunately, to earn the Nazis' good graces while providing an open avenue to transmit his secrets, Campbell becomes a German propaganda hero - ""The Last Free American"".  His cover proves too convincing by war's end, earning Campbell a spot next to ""Lord Haw-Haw"" and ""Ezra Pound"" in the victorious allies' hall of shame.  Though victorious, the allies maintain the secret of Campbell's wartime service against the Nazis, mostly because disclosure would muck up America's complicated post-war position (i.e., the ""cold war"").  Others, chiefly an OSS officer named Frank Virtanen (Goodman) are less convinced that Campbell's act was really an act, doubting that Campbell himself would have revealed himself to the Nazis had they won the war.  Campbell suffers a quiet obscurity in `50's NY, until a resurgent band of Nazis plucks him out of hiding, returning him to the public eye and its scorn.  Campbell finds himself targeted by thugs who may work for the Russians, while being essentially spat upon by everybody else.  In a twist, the only asylum he can find is with the Nazis - especially painful because their devotion undermines the only source of strength he has left: his belief in his own innocence.This was a brilliant film in that it works to achieve two seemingly opposite ends - both to exonerate and condemn the hapless Campbell.  On the one hand, we never fall for the idea of Campbell really would have thrown in his lot with the Nazis had America lost WWII.  On the other hand, like Campbell, the Nazis were also self-invented figures - actors who took their roles as genocidal supermen too seriously.  Though revealing their secrets to the allies, Campbell's propaganda-laden messages inspired the Nazis to press on, even as their shattered armies contracted further into the defeated Reich.  Years later, Campbell is forced to consider the possibility that his mission and intentions may not have been enough to outweigh the harm inflicted by a Nazi assault that took its stage cues from ""The Last Free American"".It's a challenge the script doesn't quite meet.  It would have been better had the Yanks kept Campbell on its public-enemy list because they shared Virtanen's suspicions - cold-war intrigue just seems a cheat.  The post-war Nazis themselves seem darkly laughable, but laughable is laughable, like an episode of ""Hogan's Heroes"" scripted by Roald Dahl.  A cell of these guys turns out to be, unsurprisingly, a group of old men who spend less time planning their conquest of eastern Europe than watching old propaganda movies -  including some vintage reels starring Campbell.  (I think there's something of a joke in that the decrepit surroundings in which the old Nazis take refuge is meant to recall the ""Secret Annex"" from ""The Diary of Anne Frank"".)  The frustration comes at the end when Campbell loses his faith in himself.  By then, despite signs that even the hard-hearted Virtanen may rise to his defense, Campbell surrenders himself to the Israelis for the purpose of being tried for his crimes.  Sharing an Israeli cell next to Adolf Eichman. Campbell bares the ultimate and final insult.  Though the film seeks to clear and condemn Campbell, the ending seems an unambiguous conviction.  So much for the good war, says Vonnegut.This was a great movie, with winning (if subdued) performances by Goodman and Nolte, but also Ala Arkin as a character who seems to suggest the Yossarian character he played in ""Catch-22"".  Also watch for Vonnegut himself as an unspeaking character Campbell encounters during his denoument.",Mother Night VHS

453650,"This film has features akin to many mediocre science fiction films, in that it establishes an inherently interesting premiss, but fails to portray its protagonist as a credible, fully realised character.  Whatever 'journey' or development this character then undertakes seems obvious and almost inevitable, to the point of being unsatisfying.  The plot becomes similarly devoid of surprises.  Watching this might also be compared with viewing an 'escape' movie (i.e from a prison, or prisoner-of-war camp),  where very quickly you know where everything is headed - the pleasure then becomes that of the details, the mood, and unexpected insights into people's behaviour under stress (see 'Le Trou' for a classic example) - unfortunately, 'The Truman Show' is not strong on any of these counts.*Jim Carrey has a very limited talent.  He seems like a caricature of himself, every facial expression, every bodily gesture, being exaggerated.  This is fine for generating a certain kind of humour (Jerry Lewis did something similar), but it seems less than ideal as a technique for evincing audience empathy.  His casting here is regrettable.  I can imagine people leaping to his defence, but just imagine if this film starred an actor capable of rendering a complex personality, a personality riven with conflicting emotions and desires, rather than the 'one-emotion-at-a-time' style of Carrey - think Jeff Bridges (who appeared in Weir's 'Fearless'), or if you want go for broke, a young Marlon Brando.*What is more (or less), every other character is limited in depth and humanity.  Ed Harris, blank-faced veteran of such unreflective films as 'The Firm' and 'Apollo 13', gives a one, or possibly two, dimensional performance as producer turned god (perhaps this is forgivable as humanity has never been a notable quality of producers or gods).*Weir is at his best being suggestive.  'The Last Wave' is brilliant in this regard.  He's great at certain brooding atmospheres - see also 'Witness', or 'Picnic at Hanging Rock'.  Here, however, he is being didactic (tediously so) and the atmosphere is cheesy grins and half-baked sentimentalism - not his, or anyone else's,  forte.*So, be careful with this film.  It seems to have scored high marks with the critics, and technicians such as 'script doctors', because it is 'more intelligent' than the average Hollywood product - well, yes, but when you're talking 'Hollywood' and 'intelligence' then you're talking about a very low average.*My vote for a truly great contemporary American film goes to David Lynch's 'Mulholland Drive'.",N/A

531695,"I am still laughing about this movie, even though I saw it several days ago! I have never seen a film that makes simple-mindedness, male modeling and the fashion industry so entertaining.This is easily Ben Stiller's most hilarious offering. Through mind-numbingly idiotic international male supermodel Derek Zoolander, Stiller both skewers and winks at the world's modeling/fashion industry.The plot: As the Malaysian Prime Minister prepares to raise wages for his country's impoverished workers, the powerful fashion magnates who rely on cheap labor prepare to strike back. Fashion designer Mugatu is ordered to dispose of the prime minister via an extremely dimwitted patsy, who comes along in the form of  Derek Zoolander.Zoolander becomes the perfect candidate when he looses VH1's Male Model Of The Year Award to archrival Hansel (Owen Wilson), and becomes disillusioned with the fashion industry. But, that's nothing an orange flavored coffee drink cant fix! Life is like a video for Zoolander, whether carousing with similarly dimwitted friends, working in a coal mine or facing down archrivals in back-alley 'walk-offs'.Words cannot describe the entertainment value of seeing Derek Zoolander, male supermodel, working in a coal mine with his father (jon Voight), played strangely like Christopher Walken. I almost fell off the couch.There are few genuinely smart characters in this film, but their presences only serve to make the rediculous heroes (and villains) more hilarious. Christina Taylor plays Zoolander's love interest, an intellectual reporter with Time magazine who finds out about the plot to destroy the Malaysian P.M. Jerry Stiller plays the soft-hearted owner of Balls Models, a reluctant participant in Mugatu's scheme. Finally, Saturday Night Live's outrageous Will Ferrell plays Mugatu, the evil fashion designer who programs Zoolander to do the dirty deed. I don't understand how any of the cast made this movie-I would not have been able to keep a straight face.Most of the extras in this film are, were or can be associated with the modeling/fashion/entertainment industry. Some are mentioned by name, but you can catch others if you are careful and knowledgeable about such things.There is not enough space to gush about this movie.

682359,"I was expecting ""The Anniversary Party"", co-written and co-directed by Alan Cumming and Jennifer Jason Leigh, to be a loosely-scripted, improv-heavy excuse for a bunch of their actor friends to get together in front of the camera and show off their instruments.  What I found instead was a semi-tightly plotted dissection of a marriage teetering on the brink of dissolution, a commentary on the nature of celebrity in a celebrity-saturated market, and a worthy exhibition of exhilaration and pathos.  That is until the film's last hour, which degenerates into a loosely-scripted, improv-heavy excuse for a bunch of actors friends to get together in front of the camera and show off their instruments.  Ad nauseum.Simply structured into five easily-defined segments, the film begins with many gestures of goodwill, which are slowly stripped away as it refuses to finally end.The prologue introduces Joe Therrian (Cumming) and Sally Nash (Leigh).  The first shots of the film feature a sleeping Cumming being observed by Leigh in bed, on the morning of their sixth wedding anniversary.  This segues into a quiet little scene where they both do yoga in the backyard.  These two moments, as well as a later bedroom scene, establish the pair's relationship instantly, while also subtly alluding to important plot points to come.  This is the film's strength, its use of moments and details, picked up only by the most observant viewer, that define character instantly and allude to moments to come.  It is because of this that the film holds up well on second viewing.The next segment shows Joe and Sally greeting their various guests as they arrive for the anniversary party.  Just as Joe and Sally are introduced in tableau during the film's first scenes, so do these short moments explicate the well-defined relationships between the guests and their hosts.  It's the kind of crowd that features both a recent Oscar winner, and a former Booker Prize recipient, a menagerie of talented and egocentric personalities that is vibrant and entertaining, promising at least some good times ahead.  For the most part, they deliver.Once everyone has arrived, the party begins, made up of two long sequences that do an awful lot in terms of defining character, and, especially in the second one, constructing Joe and Sally's backstory.The first is a rousing game of charades, that some take way too seriously (ratcheting up the tension) while others treat as a lark.  It's notable for the way relationships are further cemented, and for the way it sets new ones down a rocky path.The second sequence has everyone stand up in front of the crowd, one by one, presenting either a song or a joke or a dance number as an ode to Joe and Sally.  There were one too many songs, for my liking, especially since each said basically the same thing (we're glad you're back, Joe, don't ever leave our Sally again).  Kevin Kline and daughter do a wonderful balletic interpretive dance of Joe and Sally's marriage.  The little girl appears to be having the time of her life, adopting a mock serious face between bouts of cracking up.  Kline, to his credit, lets her steal the spotlight.  Mostly, this sequence is useful in that it manages to get all the things better left unsaid out in the open, as some of the guests inadvertently peel back the skin of the couple of the hour, the better to expose their inner wounds.It is dubious, however, for the last person to present, Paltrow's Davidson, thinks it a good deal to offer 15 capsules of Ecstasy to this erratic group.  From this point on, the film is a train wreck masquerading as theatre of the absurd.Now, I'm all for giving a repressed group, one with issues as delicious as these people's, an opportunity to bear their souls.  But when that opportunity is only achieved through chemistry, it feels like cheating to me.  The revelations are tainted in some way.  Which is exactly what happens here.The other problem is that this section of the movie goes on and on and on.  It tramples over nearly all the goodwill that Cumming and Leigh worked so hard to build up over the film's first half.  What was once a prudently structured little film, turns violently into a jumbled mess.  Most obnoxious here is Cumming and Leigh's little blow up scene.  Every other word is a curse; every line is punctuated by implausible hysterics and tears.  These are two wonderful actors, who've just finished proving that during the film's first half.  Poof.  All gone.  It's an unwatchable scene, one that a more seasoned director would have guided home much more ably.Once the Ecstasy has worn off (ironically, the ecstasy of the film wore off just as Ecstasy the drug made its appearance), the film can get down to the business of finally ending.  Hold your horses!  There's the denouement to consider.  Or was it an epilogue?  No matter.Where conventionally closure should exist, one last wrench is thrown into the works, and somehow, this brings peace and resolution to the characters.  I didn't think it possibly, but Cumming and Leigh almost save this mess.  Still, I didn't buy the peace and resolution this last bit brought on.  Thankfully, I suspect the filmmaker's don't either.  The last shot, which bears a striking resemblance to the film's first shot, shows that the issues are left unresolved.  What we have is a just a temporary ceasefire.In the end, ""The Anniversary Party"" is little more than a vanity piece by Cumming and Leigh, an opportunity to make a personal film on the cheap, about some particularly vain people.  Which, I suppose, makes the whole endeavor rather appropriate.  If you dare R.S.V.P. to this ""Party"", take my advice and leave just after the sun goes down.",N/A
289476,"Ken Burns' eleven-hour epic brilliantly captures the tragedy of the American Civil War through folksy historians, celebrity voice-overs, searing photography, and the eloquent letters and diaries of everyday soldiers and civilians on both sides of the conflict.It has been said often enough that to truly understand the American spirit, one must study the U.S. Civil War.  In a four-year microcosm, the war summed up all the best in the United States.  Namely, the abolition of race-based chattel slavery, the vindication of democracy in a republican form of goverment in an era dominated by European monarchs, the incredible bravery of the Union and Confederate soldiers, and the sheer political and intellectual brilliance of men like Abraham Lincoln and Frederick Douglass.  Likewise, the war also displayed some of America's worst characteristics:  the vicious 1863 Draft Riots in New York City, the draft exemptions for the rich--both North and South, the 1864 massacre of 300 black Union soldiers by the Confederate army (and Robert E. Lee's refusal to stop similar racist carnage in the future), and Sherman's brutal campaign against civilians in Georgia and South Carolina.In eleven, sprawling hours, Burns and writer Geoffrey C. Ward capture the essence of the war and of the American spirit, and how the war united the country, but yet still divides it.  This is no small feat, and Burns' documentary is truly magnificent.That being said, Burns focuses just a little too much on slavery being the cause of the war (it wasn't).  The real cause was federal power versus state power.  Simply put, the South didn't think the North had any right to tell it what to do--and was convinced that the federal government was a stooge for Northern interests.  If you don't believe me, look to the fact that the U.S. nearly had a civil war over tariffs in the 1830s.  Ken Burns conveniently didn't put THAT in his documentary, but liberty and human freedom undoubtedly make a more compelling story than how much in tax you can charge to imported goods from France.  However, in all fairness, slavery (as well as Lincoln's election in 1860) was the straw the broke the camel's back (so to speak) and it was the preeminent moral and political issue of the mid-19th Century in America.The DVD extras are somewhat insightful.  Ken Burns himself comes across as a stale personality and isn't very interesting.  George Will calls the war ""the greatest war in history"".  Not true, I think the Persian Wars, Punic Wars, 30 Years War, Napoleonic Wars and World Wars I and II all outrank our civil war, but it's interesting fuel for debate.  The best interview is Stanley Crouch of the ""New York Daily News"" who gives a very candid view on the war and why Robert E. Lee is ""overrated"".",N/A

546323,"This season is the beginning of what was to come for ""The X-Files"". Unlike all other seasons, this one is not spliced together with the classic alien mythology episodes the series is now famous for. Instead, it's an entire season of stand-alone episodes, spare a few alien stories. Although lacking the wonderful mythology arc, this season began the classic X-Files formula and changed TV forever. Starting with the excellent Pilot episode, each episode is a monster-of-the-week type thing, a kind of homage to shows like ""The Twilight Zone"". The elements are all in place: the dark atmosphere, the creepy plots, and great cinematography. The first half of the season is okay, despite a few lost efforts such as ""The Jersey Devil"" and ""Ghost in the Machine"". The series really picks up with ""Ice"", placing Mulder and Scully in the arctic with parasitic worms. The last half of the season is more entertaining, with more intriguing stories. While the lack of the mythology arc puts a damper on the season, the stand-alone episodes are some of the classics. ""Eve"", ""Fire"", ""Beyond the Sea"", ""Tooms"", etc. All are great episodes that stand out to establish a medium for ""The X-Files"". Probably the most serious season, it lacks some of the bubbly humor and comedic efforts that follow in later seasons. No casual jokes are exchanged between Mulder and Scully and the most emotional episode is probably ""Beyond the Sea"", which deals with the death of Scully's father. The season wraps up its scattered alien episodes with what some consider the first true mythology episode ""The Erlenmeyer Flask"". Despite being a terrific episode that launchs the series and is the stepping stone for seasons to come, it's a great season finale, maybe the best episode of the season. While its rigidness and seriousness brings it down a bit, this is classic television. And besides, fans didn't know what was to come and knew next to nothing of the mythology. This is the season that starts it all. Everything is set up, the potential is there, and a phenomenon is born.",The X-Files - The Complete First Season
533976,"&quot;Enemy At The Gates&quot; was an excellent and carefully planned war film. I have read an incredible amount of negative reviews on this movie and I can say just one thing about it - it's one of the greatest movies I have ever seen, because it is realistic - more so than in other war movies. &quot;Enemy At The Gates&quot; portrays the Russians and the Germans exactly the way they were back then in World War II.The setting of the film is wonderful - showing Stalingrad as a city of ruins destroyed by the war and bombs. The actors are all wonderful - their intensity and psychological emotions are shown right there in their faces. I think the actors have done an excellent job on making this movie come alive and seem real - it worked! Even the romance between Tanya (Rachel Weisz) and Vassilli (Jude Law) is shown realistically. There were no sweet and sappy romantic scenes like in true Hollywood movies. These were too tough and harsh times to get really carried away with passion.The story is definitely interesting and original as well. It depicts a duel between two excellent snipers, Konig and Zaitsev. Amidst the brutal conditions in the ruins of Stalingrad, the two snipers seek each other out all the time, making the movie full of suspense and intensity.All in all, I think this movie IS worthy of 5 stars I am giving it. Definitely. Just see it for yourself and you will see what I am talking about! Go for it and watch it - you won't regret!",Enemy At the Gates

549819,"Mercifully, Woody Allen appears in this film only as one of many narrators--all either jazz critics or DJ's--which is why I was willing to watch it at all. Unlike the films, post Annie Hall, in which the unbeautiful Allen invariably plays a ""romantic"" lead, he has, this time out, stayed out of the camera's way to create what amounts to a biopic of legendary, yet little-known, guitarist Emmett Ray--considered by many to be the second greatest jazz guitarist ever, after Django Rheinhardt.Penn's performance as the gambling, drunken, pimping, egocentric, unfeeling Ray (who faints at the sight of Django and weeps at the sound of his music) is just terrific. Better yet is Samantha Morton's portrait of the mute Hattie, with whom Ray lives off and on for a number of years. In truth, this is Morton's movie. She is heartbreakingly good as the forever-eating, lovestruck young woman who, at the sound of Penn's/Ray's rendition of ""I'm Forever Blowing Bubbles"" loses her heart.The music is the other star of this film; it is great stuff--a soundtrack worth having for lovers of early jazz. And if the Ray tracks are anything to go by, he was, indeed, the second greatest guitarist of our times.A film worth seeing.",N/A
166968,"There is absolutely no other way to put this film...it is simply hilarious!Known as Italy's clown prince, the actor is a writer, director and producer who often uses his wife Nicoletta Braschi in his films.  It's clear to see whose his comedic influences are, namely Charlie Chaplin, Peter Sellers.  His international success came with the drama/comedy Life is Beautiful.  His more popular work is in the American film, Night on Earth, Down By Law, and the ever so hilarious Italian film Johnny Stecchino.This is beyond Chaplinesque, far superior, in another light!  The premise of the story is mistaken identity.  Loris is a meek and mild school bus driver who is mistaken for the serial killer who the police stake out a plan to nab him soon!  A beautiful woman from the force is part of the stakeout plan, and intently, she hooks up with him to catch him in the act!This is nonstop action of brilliant comedic scenes, such as the police tape as they have Loris under surveillance to prove he is a pervert and it's exactly what they get, innocent behavior that comes off perverted.  There isn't a way to describe that, it is just hilarious.  Then you have the grocery store theft with a bulging trench coat,  trying to put an unclothed female mannequin in the trunk of the car,  pretense of making a phone call with a video remote,  the Chinese interview, and especially the dinner party scene, the attempt at seduction by the female, etc. etc.The subtitles are easy to read, so don't freak if you haven't seen subtitles.

484461,"I have several of the graphic paperbacks from the X/1999 clamp production.  I've read and puzzled over those, and now I have spent several hours with this DVD.  There comes a point in the quest for value where one has to finally ponder why a work is the way it is.  I don't expect every DVD or book to be a work of art, but I do expect that each such effort have some sense of its purpose or potential value.In the case of 'X', I confess I am mystified.  On the surface, a young man (Kamui) returns to Tokyo at the behest of his dying mother to defend those he loves.  But he fails to defend Kotori, who loves him, and forces his friend Fuuma to make impossible choices.  On the layer below this Kamui and Fuuma are doomed to become the primary antagonists in a struggle over whether the human race should be allowed to survive.  In the ensuing fight, shared with the other dragons of heaven and earth, the destruction is sufficient to wonder whether the cure is worse than the disease.In truth, the plot is a pre-ordained ballet of opposing forces driven to a tragic conclusion.  I am not familiar with Japanese literature, but 'X' reminds me of a Greek tragedy where anyone could stop the inevitable end, but no one does.  Kamui's tragic flaw is his inability to act until it is too late.  Fuuma, supposedly the villain of the piece, seems to be the nobler of the two, simply because he throws himself into his role.  All of the characters are disjointed archetypes, but despite all of the symbols and portents, nothing really gels.So this becomes an apocalypse in search of a cause.  Harumitsu Shimuzu as put together an excellent score, which seems to capture Kamui's perpetual agonizing and the film's ambivalent perfectly.  The film's theme, 'Forever Love' by Yoshiki, is worth keeping as well.  But good music and interesting artwork are not enough to overcome a skeletal plot that never moves in any direction for long.  A glance at the final credits reveals that this was a production with a cast of hundreds, and perhaps that is the problem.  Tragedy is best when it is not designed by committee.",X - The Movie VHS

255013,"This movie should have been billed as a spoof. After two, three, and four, it is obvious that the cast wanted to have fun with the story, and it is equally(and painfully)obvious that they really did not have a script. Kirk, McCoy and Spock are camping in Yosemite, when they are called back to go rescue the peace delegates on &quot;The planet of galactic peace&quot;. The delegates have been kidnapped by a renegade Vulcan named Sybok, who happens to be Spocks(half?)brother. That was a little too pat. Sybok's quest is to find God, who according to legend lives an the other side of the barrier at the center of the Galaxy. They rescue the delegates, only to have the delegates turn on them and turn him over to Sybok, who then turns his empathy powers onto the crew of the 1701-A, and who help imprison the Captain(Admiral!)and the Captain Spock. Except that they are rescued by the Captain Scott, despite his being exposed to the empathy powers of Sybok. Scottie then runs into a wall after saying he knows the ship like the back of his hand. The two captains are soon captured by Sybok's converts, but since they are now at or beyond the barrier, Sybok turns command back over to Kirk without even making him say pretty please. They find God, except he is not God but just some super energy being who was imprisoned in the ancient galaxy by forces/powers that we never find out about for reasons that are never stated. This scene produced the highlight of the movie, when Kirk asked &quot;Excuse me. Why does God need a starship?&quot;. A semi-renegade Klingon captain and crew were thrown in to spice it up, but ultimately they only give the movie two good lines for Spock: &quot;Damn you sir, you will try.&quot; and &quot;Please sir, not in front of the Klingons.&quot; The good-guys win, the bad guys lose, the betrayed idealist becomes the hero-martyr, and all is well again. Then we are back in Yosemite, but this time Spock knows &quot;Row, Row, Row your boat.&quot;It was obvious that the cast had fun doing this movie, but if I were the one titling it, it would be Star Trek Five: The Wrath of the Screen-Writers Guild.",N/A

595098,"Just came back for seeing M. Night Shyamalan's 'Signs' and I have to say that I enjoyed it very much.  The film features some really thrilling moments and will have the audience on the edge of their seats.  The cinematography is stunning and adds so much to the creepy atmosphere.  M.Night is one of my favorite new directors, and he did not disappoint me with this highly orginal take on the 'War Of The Worlds' theme.  And as much as the movie is about aliens and crop circles, there is also an underlying theme that deals with a man's search to regain his faith in God and to find the answer as to why sometimes bad things happen to the people we love.The movie begins with a series of geometric crop circles appearing mysteriously on the farm of Graham Hess(Mel Gibson), a former priest who lost his faith after his wife was accidently killed by a truck.  At first he thinks it is a hoax perpetrated by some local hooligans, but when he watches the news and finds that these crop circles are appearing in all parts of the world, he begins to realize that something more ominous could be happening.  The animals in the area begin to act strangely, and Graham's own dogs act violently, as if they were barking at something that wasn't there.  As the tension mounts, more reports on the television about crop circles, and then some strange lights that are seen hovering in the sky over Mexico.  People begin to predict the end of the world.  Graham tries to protect his family as the reports become even more terrifying.  This all leads to a very scary finale.Although the movie is filled with tension and suspense, there are also some great moments of comic relief, and they are interspersed nicely throughout the film.  Very good performances by Mel Gibson and Joaquin Phoenix(Merill Hess, Graham's brother), but they are upstaged by the two kids, Rory Culkin and Abigail Breslin.  Where does M. Night keep coming up with these great child actors from?  One minor problem I had with the film is a little too much reliance on sentimentality--in my opinion it could of done without so much of it and still been effective.  Also, in fairness I should say that I've already talked to someone who didn't like 'Signs' as much as I did, and I've read some of the bad reviews it has received, so my advice would be to see it for yourself, especially if you liked 'Unbreakable' and 'The Sixth Sense'; if it is anything, it is certainly entertaining.  I am already highly anticipating M. Night's next effort.",Signs
471186,"Since catching an edited version of ONE NIGHT IN EDEN on PBS, I have become an ardent Sarah Brightman fan. During that first experience, my world stopped; I was in suspended animation, so enthralled I was by this gorgeous and talented creature. After learning more about her -- that she is in fact a world renowned crossover theatrical performer -- I felt like the last to know. But, as they say, better late than never, and I cannot convey the emotion Sarah elicits with her stellar vocals and ethereal presence. Since that first accidental viewing, I've been under her spell; I have become a slave to that voice, that face, those beguiling facial expressions. It's no wonder she is referred to as ""The Angel of Music"": everything about her performance conjures the image of some diaphanous being whose spiritual energies are all but spent maintaining a bridge between heaven and earth.Sarah has so much talent to spare, she makes singing appear easy, almost as if she were conversing with us. She emotes sincerity, a love for the song, and a love for performing it for us. During the opening piece, ""Eden,"" she rises from a red-draped divan -- an allusion to the album from which the newest songs for this show are selected -- dressed in a silk, black gown accessorized with a filigreed breastplate fashioned after the attire of Nordic goddesses, a nod to her theatrical roots and denoting her pop-opera fusion. She then allures us with her supple, ornamented, genteel hands as she details the shortcomings in a previous friendship. The song conveys a longing to make the friendship whole, to finish what was left unrealized. In the context of this show, the audience is now the friend, and she seduces us into putting aside our misgivings with the promise that she will attain completeness with us. She more than meets her obligation. For the rest of the program, you'll be spellbound.To further justify my admiration for this woman, I want to note the nuanced performance of the Queen classic, ""Who Wants to Live Forever."" At the beginning of the song, she looms on a dias silhouetted against a dusk-blue backdrop of roiling sky, arms out, the light coming up to reveal her hair windblown back from her face. Forward movement is implied, and I was reminded of the figurehead on the prow of a galleon, resolutely looking out over a harsh seascape. She sings of a mournful resignation to mortality, but her posture is one of defiance, her chin tilted to take the blow of the elements: ""There's no time for us/ there's no place for us/ What is this thing that builds our dreams/ yet slips away from us?"" This contrast between determination and resignation extracts even greater irony from the lyrics, and while Queen's version is good in its own right, this cover by Sarah enriches it; she makes the song her own.Sarah demonstrates her own writing ability in ""So Many Things."" Some might recognize this song as the traditional melody ""The Women of Ireland"" (you can hear the Chieftans perform it on the BARRY LYNDON soundtrack), to which Sarah has added some folk-flavored lyrics befitting world music. Her words and vocals are a fine addition to this song, maintaining the Celtic tradition while broadening its appeal. She clearly has a dead-on instinct for picking songs that facilitate her unique stamp; she understands the songs, and uses her voice as an alembic to extract the rarest of emotions, further delineating the heart of the piece.Her performance is complemented throughout with a theatrical visual style, as you'd expect from someone with roots in musical theater. In ""Captain Nemo,"" a sheer curtain suggests an underwater world, from behind which Sarah emerges wearing a lavender dress, marking a sudden shift from a red-and-black color scheme (like the EDEN album cover) to a less-somber pastel theme. As the song changes to ""La Mer,"" she steps back behind the curtain, where she and two dancers take to the air via cables to create the illusion of swimming underwater. She also performs a few of the songs she made famous as Christine in PHANTOM OF THE OPERA, demonstrating her range and power, as she does at other times in the concert, such as in the more classically flavored pieces ""Nella Fantasia,"" ""Anytime, Anywhere,"" and ""Nessun Dorma."" She also reaches up and out in ""Only an Ocean Away"" -- a piece with an electric pulse to it, very strong and modern -- going from sweet songstress in one verse to soaring diva in the next.Her vocals are often processed to accentuate lushness. The live presentations differ from the studio versions of her songs in varying degrees, most of the time noticably, sometimes just enough to enjoy them as new performances. But the real pleasure comes from watching Sarah herself. She's charming and beautiful, with the most captivating blue-gray eyes, and hair as thick as wild jungle vines. Hell, she has so much poise, I'd pay to watch this woman do her nails.There are no extra features per se on this DVD. That is, there are no extras you access through a menu, as you can inLa Luna (Live in Concert). But like the VHS edition of this concert, the presentation begins with Sarah describing her affection for Africa, with samples of the landscape and icons to which she is referring spliced in. After the concert concludes, there is another more extensive interview about the show itself. She's an insightful interviewee and you come to appreciate the exactitude she attends to her art. Other than these interviews, the DVD edition is a no-frills product, basically a simple transfer from the VHS edition. The significant difference is that the sound and picture quality are vastly improved, and I can attest to this with certainty since I had watched the tape many, many times before I upgraded to the DVD. The improvement over the VHS edition is strikingly obvious, especially in the sharpness of the picture.I recommend this concert to anyone who enjoys live performances. This is a premium show, not to be missed.",N/A

Once everyone is in they go until a member of one of the teams submits.***1/2 Check out the first Wargames at Bash '87 instead.NWA Title - Ric Flair vs. Terry Funk - Funk was a judge for Flair vs. Steamboat at Wrestlewar (Greatest Match Ever!).  After about 40 minutes of action Ric Flair pinned Steamboat to regain the title.  Funk (who had been retired) took the opportunity to congratulate and challenge Flair for the title.  Flair pointed out that there is a ranking system and Funk would just have to climb the ladder until he was #1.  Funk was enraged and gave Ric a piledriver on a table (not the weak Dudley kind either!).  Flair's neck was broken and he gave Funk a title shot in order to get his hands on him.  Great angle and a great match.  1988-89 really showed what Flair could do - classic wrestling with Steamboat, making the careers of Sting/Luger, and two all out brawls with Terry Funk. ****1/2 Find Clash of the Champions for their ""I Quit"" match.

While I was not born in England and do not understand any of the slang, it did not stop me from enjoying this film.  I thought that the use of Beethoven's 9th Symphony was a very amusing touch, as it did not quite fit in with a lot of the visuals that were expressed;  I was further amused to see this brilliant piece of music used to torture Alex, as one of his victims frightenly recognizes the identity of his attacker.

147382,"Probably Fred Williamson's most successful and best-known film in the 1970s. ""Black Caesar"" deserves much attention.  Though it is flawed at some points, it is better than most of average blaxploitation films...The film choronicles the rise and fall of Tommy Gibbs, played by Fred Williamson with star-making performance.  But what makes this film impressive is Director Larry Cohen's good ideas here and there.  This New Yorker director uses good locations in New York City to give the film an authentic feeling, and Tommy's assasination scene and car chase sense (not by a fact-moving car, but by a stop-and-going taxi with mobsters behind it) in Manhattan is terrific.  And very ironical ending of the film (shot among the debris of buildings, or old dream) expresses effectively much bitter taste of Tommy's short-lived fame and power.Larry Cohen, whose career includes films which have many cult followers (""Maniac Cop"" ""Q"" ""It's Alive,"" and many more), is also known as a writer who produces good ideas, and ""Black Caesar"" surely shows his skills.  This film is probably better understood as a homage to gangster films of the 1930s (like ""Scarface"" starring Paul Muni) and ""Black Caesar,"" of which title reminds us of ""Little Caesar"" featuring Edward G Robinson, follows the pattern of the genre.  But the film definitely belongs to blaxploitation with its characteristic energy -- particularly by the intense acting of the cast and good soundtrack by James Brown -- and if you like ""Coffy"" ""Shaft"" ""Slaughter"" or that kind of film, you like it.Some ideas, by the today's standard, are questionable -- see how Tommy beats his enemy as a revenge for old days, using a shoe-shine box, and smears his face with black shoe polish -- but overall the film is an exciting blaxploitation film with a nod to gangster movies.",N/A

I find I often use the breathing technique now, not only to get through more challenging poses but during my busy day also. The meditation tapes are wonderful.

As far as Alicia Silverstone movies, this is, by far, the best. I fell in love with Alicia Silverstone. She is the best actress ever. I can recite the whole movei practically by heart. I bug the hell out of people with my recitations of scenes. This is hilarious! You won't stop laughing the whole time. AS's portrayal of Cher is perfect. Her faces are so cute and she is so hot in anything she wears, or, doesn't wear. The soundtrack is awesome too. I recommend that. This movie is so good! I can't say it enough times! Sure, there isn't much extra on the DVD, but the movie rocks. It's the best movie ever. EVER! It's a great movie for everyone, all ages. Men and women alike will love this movie when they see it. It's hilarious. Can I say it enough? You so have to get this movie. You'll start catching yourself doing all these Cher-isms. I do all the time. YOU MUST GET THIS MOVIE OR AT LEAST RENT IT! YOU WON'T REGRET IT. Until next time, Mariah Carey rules, and so does this movie! Enjoy!!!!!",Clueless VHS
696437,"Season 4 offers a lot; I'd buy the package for ""Brothers,"" ""Family,"" and ""The Drumhead"" alone. ""The Drumhead"" is a bottle show, but it doesn't play like one: it's a searing episode, and one that continues, or at least looks at seriously, the [groundless] investigation of Picard's character and command abilities. I must say, though, it's ahead of it's time - they should have saved it for the end of season 5 after such episodes as ""I, Borg"" and ""Silicon Avatar."" Then again, it sets up nicely the possibility that maybe even Picard has seriously dangerous lapses in judgment, as we see later in those two shows. Other gems of the season include ""Family,"" in which Picard returns to Earth after the Borg incident to try and patch up his relationship with his estranged brother while getting some time to sort things out. Picard's brother Robert is a bit gruff but welcoms his brother to their home in France; Jean-Luc, full of self doubt and distraught by his own lack of confidence as a result of his inability to resist assimilation, is tempted to leave Starfleet when he is invigorated by the promising youthfulness of Robert's son. Robert confronts his brother, encourages him to get back where he belongs, get back in the saddle, and they come to terms with their past differences and grudges in an old-fashioned fist fight in the mud behind the house. They laugh about their differences, now behind them, and Picard returns to his Enterprise emotionally healed. ""Brothers"" is also a gem, and continues the family theme from the aforementioned episode. In ""Brothers,"" Data is reunited with his father, Dr. Noonian Soong, in the wake of a bizarre accident onboard the Enterprise in which a child almost kills his brother. Data learns a lot about himself and his own little family: his father is brilliant and reclusive, alive when thought dead, he never knew his ""mother,"" and his brother (Lore) is opportunistic and maniacal. We're left with the thought that Data, in his own way, is very much human. After Lore shows up and goes on a violent rampage, Dr. Soong is left critically injured. Lore escapes before Data or the Enterprise crew can help, and the old man leaves his emotionless ""son"" with words that will give you shivers: in your own way, Data, you will grieve. The accident onboard the Enterprise that almost killed the child's brother is attended to, the child is saved, and we're left with Data watching them play.Season 4 is slightly unusual in that it hits the ground running and maintains its momentum throughout. Other goodies include: ""Final Mission,"" ""Legacy,"" and ""Future Imperfect."" ""Devil's Due"" is a romp, much like ""Qpid"" and ""The Nth Degree,"" where after encountering an alien probe Lt. Barclay's I.Q. is increased by hundreds of times. He connects himself to the computer, debates quantum physics and advanced math with Albert Einstein, and bests him. ""The Nth Degree"" features some cool visuals as well. ""Legacy"" is a good action episode and stirs up old memories for the crew when they visit the planet tasha Yar grew up on to recover a downed shuttle.There really aren't any shows that this season could do without; most seasons have at least one junk episode, but this one does not, along with season 7. All of the characters get their own showcase epsiode this season, and some get more than one. Data gets ""Brothers,"" ""Data's Day,"" and ""In Theory."" Picard gets ""Family,"" ""Final Mission"" along with Wes Crusher, and several other episodes. Troi is showcased in ""The Loss,"" and it's great to see her get to develop Troi from here on out; she's far above and beyond the cheerleader of seasons 1 and 2. Dr. Crusher and Wes get ""Remember Me,"" and Worf is showcased in ""Reunion"" and ""Redemption, Part I,"" two episodes that sort of ignite his ""family honor/Gowron"" theme that returns throughout the series. Riker's character gets to shine in ""First Contact"" and ""Future Imperfect.""I highly recommend season 4 and it's lineup of intriguing, emotionally charged stories. Character development is finally and thankfully made the driving force of the year. While season 3 was a colossal leap forward, year 4 was the pay off of the first 4 seasons.",N/A

676639,"First off, I was ... misled ...  The previews in no way suggested that this movie would be a musical.  Although visually pleasing, the bits and pieces of pop music scattered throughout the movie was somewhat disconcerting.  I just couldn't get used to it.  It might have been a bit better if I would have known whether most of the movie was meant to be joking or serious.  I swear, every time they burst into a remade pop song, I was waiting for a punch line only to be confused when there wasn't any.  I am assuming the ""Like a Virgin"" scene was a joke, and, although I now find it hilarious, the first time I saw the movie I was so confused as to whether the director was joking and trying to make the audience laugh, or if he was in earnest ...  I would have just given this movie two stars, but for one reason.  The remake or ""Roxanne"" was so poinient and so well done I would buy the movie just for that.",N/A

The box structure and layout remains the same, the foldout holding the DVDs is the same material as the rest. Overall the physical layout of the box set is the same as before.My only complaint with the entire box set is the layout on each disk. This time, instead of having short clips of all the episodes on the disk play back to back, or having a separate screen for each episode, the disk is split in half, with two screens for clips, each one alternating between two episodes. It makes it harder to follow than previous disks, unless you're familiar with all the episodes on that disk you're not sure where each episode ends and the next begins.",N/A

If you saw them before then or after it, his voice sounds SO much better.

675926,"I can see how this film would be popular with a certain audience.  Hedwig is one of those cutsey/artsy films that is clearly in origin intelligent enough to be really great but seems so caught up in its gimick rather than getting down to telling a story that in the end I couldn't consider this film anything more than a failure.True, there are plenty of films that don't have half the talent that Hedwig does, but its just that promise with a failure to deliver that's so frustrating.  So, let's itemize this nonesense:1.  If you don't love the music, forget it.  The obvious nods to Bowie are certainly enjoyable, but the music literally pads out over half the movie.  In a true musical, we actually have the narrative of the story explained and strengthened through the songs.  At times it feels like Hedwig was doing this but most of the time it seems like they were having more fun doing fake music performances.  Why not just watch Spinal Tap instead?  Because the songs take up the majority of the film and bring the tiny amount of narrrative flow in the movie to a near standstill, unless you're absolutely enthralled with the music in Hedwig, the film can't help but dissapoint.2. What I was waiting to develop during all those songs was a great story that just didn't happen.  I was actually interested in main character and many of the unexplained side characters.  The fact that hedwig was a TRUE freak among a profession of poesers was absolutely fascinating.  Did the movie bother to explore any of this?  Absolutely not.3. What we get instead of an actual resolution to the nonexisting story is a rather inept attempt at a freak-out ending, complete with sets that were formerly all black changing to all white, Hedwig rips off his/her close, walking around near naked and looking identical to his love/hate boyfriend Tommy.  There's supposed to be something deep with how men and women used to be one being and were split, but it feels as though it was carried off so incompetantly or simply incompletely that whatever message the director was intending feels utterly lost--meaning that really the last 20 minutes are essentially a waste.I'm left wondering why this film has received such a high rating and so many positive reviews.  Where other films have explored similiar grounds with much greater effectiveness, Hedwig seems only capable of raising them, singing about them, but then gives up.  Or perhaps it was just one big music video?  Hedwig certainly isn't the worst film I've seen by any measure, rather, it isn't a movie.  Just a pretentious artsy pile posing as one.",Hedwig and the Angry Inch
592104,"To begin with, this movie is very emotionally charged and poignant and sends a distinct message concerning the rapid decline of our health care system.  It is a story of one individual driven to take extreme measures when all other courses of action have failed.Denzel Washington stars as John Q. Archibald who is a hard working family man trying his very best to keep his finances solvent and trying to make a better life for his family.  It is discovered early on, while at his son's baseball game, that his son collapses and is diagnosed with a life threatening heart condition.  The prognosis for his son is that he needs a heart transplant in a very short time.  John Q discovers that his insurance policy does not cover the needed medical costs to have this operation take place and he is suddenly initiated into the unfair and cruel realities of our health system.Anne Heche, who plays the consummate hospital administrator, tells John Q his son needs to placed on a list for heart recipients and that a heart transplant comes with an enormous cost which he cannot possibly afford.  Almost devoid of sympathy and acting in a manner akin to a corporate CEO or policy maker or politician, the administrator's true interest here is the profit margin and having the correct type of insurance coverage or nothing at all.  John Q is basically told that there is nothing that can be done for him whatsoever.John Q pleads with the cardiologist (James Woods) to perform the operation and that he will raise the necessary funds and pay him any way that he can as soon as he can.  The doctor basically tells him that he is out of options also and that his dying son will be discharged from the hospital very soon.  John Q's distraught wife urges her husband to take some form of action immediately to save their son's life.  Being forced into a corner with nowhere to turn, John Q decides to take control of the hospital (along with hostages) until an agreement can be made to help his son.Ray Liotta and Robert Duvall star as police officers trying to diffuse the situation with each one of them having differing and conflicting ideas on how to terminate the hostage crisis.  As the movie proceeds, you are able to see the interactions that unfold between John Q, his hostages, his family, and the police.  It is a moving and emotional time leading ever closer to his son losing his battle to live.  By what might be attributed to a miracle, the hospital receives word that a properly matched heart has been located and is flown to the hospital to save the son of John Q.  A successful operation is perfomed which saves the life of his son, ends the hospital crisis, and subjects John Q to the legal system for the acts he has committed.The actions of John Q, although criminal, were not borne out of machismo or malice or spite, but instead were acted out because of serious desperation and the deep love for his son and his desire for his son to have an equal chance to live a long, healthy, and prosperous life.The main characters in this movie, Denzel Washington, James Woods, Robert Duvall, Ray Liotta, and Anne Heche, delivered excellent perfomances and made the movie very enjoyable.  The plot does, at times, seem a little sensational or maybe a little too manufactured but it does not really deter from the true meaning of the movies message.  This movie idealizes a loving father saving his son's life and having to fight an unjust health care system that should benefit all citizens but doesn't due to it's myriad problems and unfair practices.I highly recommend this movie to everyone and would venture to say that it is probably one of Denzel Washington's best performances to date.  Very enjoyable movie.",N/A

Mandy Moore's performance as the shy and reserved Jamie Sullivan was both inspiring and believable, her acting proved to be nothing more than perfect, she really made the character come alive. Shane West played the part of Landon Carter to perfection, in the beginning of the movie his character was like this tough, bad boy I don't give a sh** about anything and then he meets Mandy Moore's character and the way their friendship blossoms into love changes him in a way that he never thought possible and Shane does that transformation so well. Shane and Mandy's chemistry in this movie is electric and seeing them together in some of the scenes in this movie such as when she tells him that she is dying from cancer, or when he tells her that he loves her definitely touched my heart and brought tears to my eyes. This movie is about true love, faith, and that admist all of those goals we wish to accomplish in our lives the greatest one we can accomplish is finding true love.

382526,"Tales about sinister, creepy mansions were already cliched by the time director James Whale directed THE OLD DARK HOUSE--and instead of presenting the piece as a straight-forward thriller he mixed the film's very atmospheric cinematography with a wild strain of parody.  The result is a movie with a bizarre camp humor that foreshadows Whale's slightly later and even more bizarrely camp THE BRIDE OF FRANKESTEIN.  The plot, based loosely on a J.B. Priestly novel, is perfunctory, existingly only to throw together an ensemble cast of already-famous and soon-to-be-famous stars.  Five motorists are trapped in the wilds of Wales during a horrific storm and are forced to seek shelter at, of course, an old dark house... but their unwilling hosts are a neurotic Ernest Thesiger, his religious fanatic sister Eva Moore, and their hulking, deformed, and mute butler Boris Karloff.  Before the night is over the storm-weary travelers experience everything from a hellish meal to religious lectures--not to mention assault, attempted rape, mysterious cackling, a bit of arson, and a touch of homosexual hysteria (courtesy of Thesiger, Moore, and a surprise male character who is actually played by a woman) thrown in for good measure.The cast is exceptional; in addition to Karloff, Thesiger, and Moore, we have Melvyn Douglas, Raymond Massey, Charles Laughton, Gloria Stuart, and Lilian Bond, and they wring the most from the covertly wicked script, with Eva Moore ranting about ""laughter and sin,"" Thesiger inviting Raymond Massey into his room ""to see a few things,"" and one of the most socially awkward meals ever put to film.  But the film's real power is its cinematography: when they say old DARK house, they really mean it, and the look of the film is just as disorienting for viewers as for the characters; particularly noteworthy is the scene in which Moore lectures Gloria Stuart, with their faces distorted by the bedroom mirror, and the sequence in which Karloff pursues the white-clad and wind-whipped Gloria Stuart with mayhem in mind. Viewers who expect ""Universial Horror"" fare will probably be disappointed by THE OLD DARK HOUSE, and director James Whale would create a still more memorable combination of horror and high-camp with THE BRIDE OF FRANKENSTIEN.  But THE OLD DARK HOUSE is an overlooked jewel of unusual quality: a sardonic parody of a famous theme, well played, filmed and scripted.  Recommended.",Old Dark House VHS
364043,"Richard Donner's madcap kids adventure was a big hit in it's own little way back in the 80s, and it's not hard to see why. It's filled with memorable lines and wacky humour that appealed to kids back then. But is it actually that good? Well, some of it is a bit grinding sometimes, where the film starts to verge on ""screaming"" humour, which we all know, ain't funny at all. But the bunch of weirdos who go off in search of 'One-eyed Willie's treasure proves for some good-natured fun and innocent adventure.The standout performance in the film is Jonathan Ke Quan (INDIANA JONES AND THE TEMPLE OF DOOM), where we find out, that HEY, Some kids CAN act! It's fun to spot all the young kiddies who went on to bigger things like Josh Brolin and Sean Astin. And of course, Jeff Cohen as the wimpy 'Chunk' who keeps coming across corpses, providing some halarious moments. The fact that Donner helmed this small-scale adventure seems strange, given that he went on to do things like THE OMEN and the LETHAL WEAPON films, but it's handled well, and dosn't get TOO far-fetched. You have to have bad guys of course, and this one has Robert Davi (From A VIEW TO A KILL) and THE MATRIX's Joe Pantoliano as the bumbling Fratelli brothers chasing after the ""Goonies"".

543624,"Writer/director Kevin Smith's characters Jay and Silent Bob made their first appearance in 1994's cult favorite, ""Clerks"". They stood outside a convenience store. Ostensibly, they were selling pot, but, for the most part, they just hung out waiting for something to happen. They appeared in all of Smith movies over the next five years [""Mallrats"", Chasing Amy"" and ""Dogma""]. Now comes ""Jay and Silent Bob Strike Back"", in which the pair must carry an entire movie, rather than playing minor roles. Because they are basically one big joke, the results are uneven. The scenes that work are some the funniest moments in recent movies. The rest, which are in the minority, are pretty painful. Whatever the scene, be forewarned that these guys remain consistently perverse and offensive.This is a road movie, and the plot is just an outline to which the various skits are attached. The movie starts off outside the very same convenience store where Jay and Silent Bob [Jason Mewes and Kevin Smith] were first seen in ""Clerks"".They learn that a movie studio is about to make a film based on ""Bluntman and Chronic"", a comic book. Jay and Bob were the inspiration for the comic, and they are furious that they are getting neither cash nor credit from the project. They decided to go to Hollywood to stop the movie production and to get revenge. Along the way, they become the unwitting pawns of a beautiful girl gang of jewel thieves. They're easy targets since both Jay and Silent Bob are complete morons.Whether or not you find the movie funny depends on a couple of things. One is an appreciation of Hollywood in-jokes.  Rarely has a movie been so full of them. The title itself is a reference to ""The Empire Strikes Back"". The original Princess Leia and Luke Skywalker, Carrie Fisher and Mark Hamil, have cameo appearances. So do lots of other actors, like Matt Damon and Ben Affleck. Smith executive produced the movie that made them famous, ""Good Will Hunting"". The girl gang is a parody of ""Charlie's Angels"". The movie references are so numerous that there are references to references. For some viewers, all this insider stuff will become exasperating. Others will love it, as they try to recognize as many as possible. I found it all to be fun yet completely self-indulgent, since, ultimately, it's all about how hip and knowledgeable Smith and his buddies are.The other thing required to enjoy this movie is a fondness for crude humor, or, perhaps in this case, a love of it. There is enough bathroom humor and profanity in the first twenty minutes to last some people a lifetime. I read that a certain four-letter word is used here 228 times, a figure I've no reason to doubt. Graphic sexual references abound, due mainly to Jay's complete obsession with the subject. Since many people are already familiar with Smith's characters, they won't be seeing or hearing anything unexpected. It's other people who need to be warned. This movie goes way beyond merely risqu&eacute;.It is only fair to point out that several groups have protested Jay's totally homophobia behavior. I doubt these attempts to censure Smith are necessary. He's a satirist. No group, be it women, blacks, Catholics, teenagers, old people or gays, escape his twisted humor. Even the stars playing themselves, such as Damon and Affleck, come off as ditzy fools. Smith himself laughs the criticism off, noting that everyone knows Jay and Silent Bob are idiots. At least we hope they do. On the other hand, aren't there always a few idiots in an audience?",Jay and Silent: Bob Strike Back
262564,"Cynics would hardly expect much from a movie featuring such fan mag confections as Sandra Dee and Troy Donahue, whose blonde coiffures graced many a Photoplay cover of the day. (Then, there is the friend who cautioned never to trust a film in which the boy is prettier than the girl.) That being said, the film holds up surprisingly well as a super slick piece of 50's soap opera, in which the usually vapid Donahue and the baby-faced Dee remain rather affecting as lovers despite the handicaps. Thankfully, Donahue is called upon to do little more than look earnestly concerned, while Dee pouts and emotes in wide-eyed, photogenic fashion that brought out many an audience handkerchief. Credit should go to producer-writer-director Delmer Daves for almost transcending the material with an earnest plea to humanize love and sex away from the dead hand of our Puritan forebearers. In the uptight 50's, that was no small risk and could even be construed as a commitment to free love and communism. As writer, Daves may not have thought in subversive terms, but his plea was enthusiastically received by teens of the day, who flocked to the film in droves. As producer, Daves had the good sense to bolster his youthful celebrities with a first-rate supporting cast, including the always commanding Constance Ford as the Puritan witch, along with the ever versatile Arthur Kennedy, at his sardonic and smirking best. Also holding up over time--photographer Harry Stradling's glossy transformation of coastal life into a series of blissfully romanticized frames that contribute greatly to the movie's travel brochure atmosphere. Unfortunately, Daves remains an under-rated filmmaker from that era, while A Summer Place proves he could handle the treacly fare just as effectively as the more cowboy kind he was used to. Also of passing interest--anyone wondering how teen culture moved out of the 50's to become that of the free-wheeling 60's should catch this movie for its few hesitant steps, suggesting, I suppose, that it's the Delmer Daves of the world that effect real change, rather than the more lauded and esoteric art house crowd.",N/A
363057,"This is the kind of dark, bleak comedy that the British excelled at in the 1950s, and seems to anticipate many of the comic trends found on both sides of the Atlantic in the decades that were to follow.  The plot concerns the adventures of a group of thieves who meet in the apartment of Alec Guinness, the gang's mastermind and the tenant of the lady of the title.  Although the movie has many wonderful moments, I think my favorites are those in which a wildly grinning Guinness explains to his landlady the various goings on in his flat.The cast is absolutely first rate.  Even by Guinness's chameleonic standards, this is one of his more unusual performances.  He made himself up to bear a striking resemblance to the great Alastair Sim, wearing some padding to make his frame look more like Sim's, and wearing false teeth and combing his hair to more successfully mimic Sim.  It is a quite successful imitation, but I would enjoy knowing a bit more about why Guinness made this decision.  Anyone familiar with the Pink Panther films will be delighted to see Peter Sellers and Herbert Lom as members of Guinness's gang.  Lom was one of the great heavies in 1950s British film, and his casting in a comedy film was at the time highly unusual.  Sellers, of course, was a few years from the film that would first bring him fame, I'm ALRIGHT, JACK, and his role in this film is not a major one.  This is very definitely the &quot;early&quot; Peter Seller, carrying a great deal more weight before he lost a great deal because of the illnesses that plagued him throughout most of his life (Sellers suffered from a very serious heart condition the eventually killed him).This film isn't for everyone.  It isn't a film that will illicit laughs so much as smiles.  And many will find the entire tone to be very, very dark, perhaps too dark for their liking.  Finally, many will not enjoy a comedy in which all the major characters are essentially unlikable cads.  But for those of us for whom these are not barriers, this is one of the most unique and enjoyable comedies of the 1950s.",The Ladykillers VHS

There is no discussion of proper body alignment (though Tracey Rich certainly demonstrates admirable positioning herself), the only modifications provided are for people who are more advanced (which is not the likely to be the largest audience for this or any other yoga tape), and the pace is basically breakneck.  Most teachers will tell you that yoga is to be done with the breath, and doing the ujjayi breathing that is taught at the beginning of this tape tends to slow and deepen the breath... However, Ms. Rich whips through the movements at a frenetic pace that has never left me time to do the asanas with proper care.  I find that I have to do this tape with the remote at hand to stop the program frequently so that I can do the movements at a pace appropriate for me.If you want an aerobic routine, this might be the ticket due to the speed of the instruction.  If you are brand-new to yoga, this tape may be quite frustrating due to the pace and lack of true beginner-level guidance.  If you have done yoga for awhile and have a good grasp of proper alignment, this program can provide a moderate challenge (again, mostly due to the speed, rather than the difficulty of the asanas).While this is a great tape, I just don't think it is a good choice for *most* beginners.  Although many reviewers seem to find the Yoga Journal tapes &quot;too slow,&quot; they are a much better intro and provide more guidance for proper alignment, modifications, etc.Incidentally, I agree with other reviewers' comments about the clean, plain set.  I don't mind the exotic locales in most tapes, but they don't exactly provide the viewer any real benefit.  Tracey Rich's ramrod-straight bearing and slightly cranky expression seem very businesslike, in contrast with the often woozy/dreamy vibe put out by most video yogis.  And it's not a negative, just a comment, but Ms. Rich is wearing more makeup in this video than I've ever seen in any other yoga video or in a live class!Overall, a good tape for people with a well-integrated sense of proper alignment and at least some yoga experience.",Total Yoga VHS

The movie itself is wonderful and includes the voice talents of Billy Crystal, John Goodman, Steve Buscemi, John Ratzenberger, Jennifer Tilly, and James Coburn. As you probably already know the storyline, I'll just talk about DVD.You get 2 discs- one contains the movie itself (with the ""full screen"" or ""widescreen"" versions, as well as a director's commentary option)and the second disc is chock full of goodies! You get ""For the Birds"" the 2001 Academy Award winner for Best Animated Short Film (shown in theaters before the movie), and ""Mike's New Car"" (exclusively created for the video and DVD release, as well as an exclusive sneak peek of ""Finding Nemo"", the newest upcoming release from Disney starring Ellen DeGeneres, Albert Brooks, and Willem Dafoe. Plus, if you choose the ""Human Door"" option, you get a tour of the Pixar animation studios by the makers of the film. They'll show you deleted scenes, 3-D location flyarounds, and animation gags and ""inside"" jokes. The ""Monster World"" door is where the real fun starts- train for your first day at Monster's Inc.; see the employee handbook, and play the ""Boo's Door Game"", which works like a CD rom-type game. Use your remote control to go through doors and find pieces of Boo's door that come together like a puzzle. The kids and I had tons of fun playing this together.

I have not had the desire to sit through the 'longer' version just yet but it will be interesting to see what elements of the movie were removed prior to it's original release.

If the subject matter is tough for you to get into, then check it out just for Emma Thompson's performance. Amazing. Emma stars as Vivian Bearing, an English teacher who is diagnosed with cancer. The film then follows her through her life and her ordeal with the deadly disease. It's all her. The whole film focuses on her and her point of view, and doesn't go for the medical view of it. It's about human compassion. It's about facing one's mortality. The movie is so shockingly real, with no cotton candy covering at all. Emma Thompson's performance is nothing short of astonishing. You feel for her. You pray for her. You feel as if you know her. I certainly did. This film brought back some very personal memories of my own. My aunt died from cancer a number of years ago. She moved in with us and we took care of her. I watched as she faded away. Rather quickly at that as well. The images and different stages of it that I saw were really tough on an 11 year old. Images I will never forget as long as I live. She was misdiagnosed at the beginning, and when it was corrected, it was too late. She would still be here with us today if it had been diagnosed correctly. This film was a definite hearttugger for me. Have some hankies handy. Director Mike Nichols is a genius. Both him and Emma deserve Emmy's. Wit is a groundbreaking film. The best Made For Cable film in ages.",Wit

587291,"David Lynch's &quot;Mulholland Drive&quot; is one of the best movies I've seen in many years, even though I'm still trying to figure out what actually happened in this 2.5 hour movie.  Unlike most films that operate on logic, &quot;Mulholland Drive&quot; works on the emotions.  If you want a mystery that &quot;ties everything together,&quot; then this isn't the movie for you.The plot involves a brunette who, having just survived a car accident, staggers through the streets of LA, apparently not remembering her name or the accident.  She stumbles her way into a posh home, where she befriends a perky blonde, who just flown from Canada to launch an acting career.  Together, they try to discover the brunette's identity.Meanwhile, a young hotshot director is being manipulated by members of the mob, who insist they have a say as to who should be cast as leading lady in his film.  This subplot, I guess, is Lynch's commentary on Hollywood and the often dubious politics that go on during movie-making.Despie the movie's incoherence, &quot;Mulholland Drive&quot; is absolutely fascinating to watch.  Everything, from the camerawork to Angelo Badalamenti's seductive score to Naomi Watts's award-calibre performance, grabs hold of your attention and refuses to let go.  But just when you THINK you've understood the movie, the film's final third takes a dramatic, unexpected turn.  I won't reveal what it is, but it will certainly throw you in for a loop.The DVD itself has a great 5.1 soundtrack and a crisp and vivid picture.  However, all we get for features are the trailer and &quot;10 clues.&quot;  What's really frustrating, though, is that the film has only ONE chapter: the movie itself!  That's right, you can't go from scene to scene in this film without hitting your fast-forward button.

The back stabbing in question ceasing to be a metaphor at one point. Just thought I'd mention it, though. No dancing around the Dahlias then, just corpses.Allegedly funny, this modest genre outing proves nothing less than the pornography of violence, the sadism of which precludes any real fun. Did I say fun? There must be a reason why it has engendered so many repeat viewings and that can only be due to the performance of Jeff Combs, although the rest of the cast is strong. Combs manages to introduce elements of a walking cartoon into his performance without losing focus and realism. It's quite a turn. Having found his niche, Mr Combs has continued to work mostly outside the mainstream of movie production where he has no doubt progressed from playing the unhinged Mr West to characters without any window frame at all. I have only seen three of his oeuvre, so I cannot testify to the accuracy of this statement but should the situation change I expect uncanny prescience to be the order of the day.Nice touch when a character actually collapses from shock, an affliction that curiously escaped the beleagered Ash in 'The Evil Dead' in which he suffered considerably worse without the employ (however Dionysian) of a side kick.",N/A

346538,"What would you do, as a fulfillment of office, if you were given the chance to stand-in for the President of the United States? ""Dave"" answers this question in a light political comedy that is sure to please anyone. The film may not be as intelligent a material as ""The American President,"" but it is still a winner in its own right, and much more.A stroke while on adulterous sex has the incumbent President incapacitated by stroke, and look-alike Dave is secretly planted into the position by the scheming Chief of Staff to prevent the ""Boy Scout"" VP from taking it otherwise (the movie leaves us to deduce much of the Chief's hidden agenda. It is quite bloody when you think about it.) Other than a breach in democracy and the breaking of a multitude of laws, what follows is the heartwarming story of a White House adventure that is very satirical, endearing, funny, melancholic and ultimately romantic.Originally, I thought of giving this film four stars, but changed my mind since having noticed that it got better and better with each viewing. Having seen this film more than once, I also found out that what makes ""Dave"" work is not only its ability to warm the heart, but to make it soar as well. We find a connection with Dave (Kevin Kline) that makes us want to give him a big hug for the things he did in the White House. What is mostly curious is the movie's ability to arouse the pride of the nation, all the while saying (and portraying) that ""the country has a lot of problems that we don't want to face them anymore.""The wonderful storyline is seasoned with:1.) lots of excellent performances (to name one, watch Frank Langella silently boil over as he helplessly watches Dave do cuts with the budget,)2.) lots of cameos by real-life politicians, and personalities from TV, film and media, lending credibility to an otherwise incredible story.3.) lots of comic moments,4.) some one-line punchers such as Sigourney Weaver's ""Go to hell..."" (for a 1993 movie, this remark seems to hail a future event,) Charles Grodin's ""Get out of here as fast as you can!"", and the sudden and uncalled for remark of the real president, "" &iexcl;Kjust get rid of that grin, you look like a schmuck.""5.) and at least a seemingly irrelevant (and short) but ultimately funny scene where the dialogue veered into the topic of thick necks and sweaters.This movie is bound to raise different kinds of questions. It makes us ask why things are always otherwise than that of the movie. Could be that this is bred from our want of political heroes, something which our modern world lacks and lacks and lacks. My answer, ""Let the film inspire you."" However on the other side, one will find implausible such a scenario as the film's premise. My answer, ""Who cares??""",N/A

689973,"This is a brilliant and highly original animated film, directed by Richard Linklater. It is definitely not a children's movie, not because it contains ""adult"" themes, but because it is very verbal and intellectual. It is actually a series of discussions on philosophical topics. The unifying theme is dreaming. The protaganist is a young man who cannot seem to wake from his dream. As he encounters many eccentrics, who expound on existentialism, evolution and rebellion (real life conspiracy theorist Alex Jones is the voice of a rabble rouser), he gradually realizes he is having a long lucid dream (a lucid dream being a dream where you know you are dreaming). Can he ever wake up? Are dreams and waking really separate worlds? The highly creative and original animation provides a superb visual counterpart to the film's intellectualism, which would be a little dry if it was just people talking to each other. In this manner the film satisfies both sides of the brain. The voices are entertaining and diverse; among them are Ethan Hawke and Julie Delpy, who starred in Before Sunrise, another Linklater film.

A large portion of Spy Game was spent largely on dialogue... not very good dialogue, mind you.  More captivating films tend to show these professional spies in action, i.e. jumping out of airplanes or making large buildings explode.  This may not be the case in real life, but it's what we paid to see.Robert Redford may have acted his character well, but was he interesting enough to glue his audience to the screen?

The characters are cardboard cutouts and the action is so plodding it stands still. This could be better described as a SDS propaganda film made twenty odd years after the fact. The use of 16mm film could have added power if there had just been something of a story to be told.Instead we are introduced to the caring Bos, but we are never given any clues to why he cares, who he is, or what he actually thinks about anything.

491100,"My favorite female performer in the history of film is Barbara Stanwyck. Unlike many actresses, she could excell in sympathetic roles, comedic roles, and sinister roles. We could love her or hate her. Unfortunately, this enormous versatility of hers kept her from making as many romantic or screwball comedies as I would have liked. As great as she could be in comedy (especially in her three great comedic pictures, BALL OF FIRE, her other, even better, holiday film REMEMBER THE NIGHT, and the incomparably brilliant THE LADY EVE, which provided her with one two or three greatest screen roles, and which also took place partly in Connecticut), she made comparably few.CHRISTMAS IN CONNECTICUT is a good film, and Stanwyck is Stanwyck, but despite many fine and enjoyable moments, it does not rank among her very best. The problem does not lie with her, but with her costar Dennis Morgan, who although quite handsome and possessed of a beautiful baritone, was more than a little stiff as an actor, and not terribly good at comedy. The supporting cast, however, is utterly first rate. The film provided S. K. ""Cuddles"" Sakall one of his finest roles, as Felix, the person who provides columnist Stanwyck her recipes. Reginald Gardiner is also excellent, as the would-be and more than a little dull suitor, less oily and dislikable than most of his other roles. Sydney Greenstreet is great in a role that we more normally associate with Charles Coburn in the forties.But a couple of things keep me from liking this film as much as I might have. First, there is the aforementioned Morgan. I find him just a little too dull. A good singer and serviceable in musicals, but not a comic talent.  I know Cary Grant and Joel McCrea weren't available for every film being made in the decade, but I do regret that someone with a little more charisma. Second, there is a problem with the script that makes the film seem too formulaic for me. Now, this is a formula picture, like most comedies, apart from the greatest classics (like THE LADY EVE or BRINGING UP BABY, which, by the way, used the same house as this one). The trick with the good formula pictures is that they don't allow the formula to drive the picture as key moments. This one does. For instance, when Barbara meets Dennis Morgan for the first time, she is almost instantly smitten with him. Why? Was it because things happened that indicated a magical chemistry? No, it was because the plot required that she fall in love with him right away. Contrast this with the long initial seduction scene where Barbara causes Henry Fonda to fall in love with her in THE LADY EVE, during which she unexpectedly falls in love with her prey. Now, later in the film, her talent takes several scenes over and she makes their attraction seem more plausible than the script itself does. But their first several minutes seem faked, more a need of the film's story than anything else.Still, another good Barbara Stanwyck movie. Not all of her movies are good, but I have never seen her in a film in which she wasn't superb. Anyone seeing this primarily because it is a holiday movie should definitely go out of their way to see the even better REMEMBER THE NIGHT, in which Barbara goes home with Fred MacMurray to Indiana for the holidays.",N/A
16320,"APT PUPIL(USA/France - 1997)Aspect ratio: 2.39:1 (Super 35)Theatrical soundtracks: SDDS-8 / Dolby Stereo SRBased on a Stephen King novella first published in the 'Different Seasons' anthology in 1982, Bryan Singer's masterful thriller - his immediate follow-up to the cult favorite THE USUAL SUSPECTS (1995) - is a virtual two-hander between venerable Brit actor Ian McKellen as a decrepit former Nazi living in seclusion in a small American town, and young Brad Renfro (THE CLIENT) as a budding sadist whose unhealthy interest in the Holocaust sends him directly to McKellen's door, having recognized him from old photographs which betray his prior identity. Forced to recount the details of his murderous past to the boy, who threatens to expose him otherwise, these two deeply unpleasant characters begin to awaken long-dormant mutual impulses, with inevitably tragic consequences...Superbly acted, especially by the two leads, and directed by Singer with exquisite grace from Brandon Boyce's tightly-constructed screenplay, the film explores the ways in which history affects the present, and how the seeds of genocide can blossom unexpectedly from within the most ordinary - seemingly benign - circumstances. When Renfro asks McKellen how it felt to kill people, he's actually testing his own capacity for unimaginable evil, and one suddenly understands how the Holocaust was possible, and how a similar atrocity could easily happen again, even in the most 'civilized' society. Despite first-class performances and production values, the movie wasn't a box-office success, partly because we're invited to sympathize with an unrepentant monster and his all-too-willing disciple. David Schwimmer, Elias Koteas, Bruce Davison and Joshua Jackson are featured in brief supporting roles.NB. Similar territory is explored in Agustin Villaronga's extraordinary thriller IN A GLASS CAGE (1986), a Spanish masterpiece in which a former Nazi doctor is visited at his isolated home by one of his victims, a young man whose experiences as a child in the concentration camps have unleashed all kinds of monsters from his broken mind.

And that is a good thing.Frida is an amazing collage of one of the most fascinating artists, sexual and political women of our time. Like many others her paintings, at first repulsed me, but after reading excerpts from Herrera's biography on Frida- ( which is bogged down on the love letters and love making, with hardly a comment on the political and national turmoil of the times),- one could see why the painting's were so full of sorrow and life defying pain.Frida lived in some very volatile times the revolution in Russia with Trotsky living in her house. Her husband and mentor and much admired muralist Diego Rivera going to New York, commissioned to paint a mural for Rockefeller and painting Lenin as one of the struggling workers. When asked to remove Lenin from the painting, he refused and Rockefeller tore the mural down.It was a time of great nationalism and the struggle to stop the European influence in Mexico.Many kudos' to Salma Hayek for her devotion to this biopic. I was very concerned that it could not be done, but it has been done and a great job. There's got to be some Oscar nominations out of this beautiful movie.

The two main characters, Salma and Molina fit as a pair of gloves and Tango around each other as honeybees around a bright red poppy.If you miss this movie you will have missed one of the best biopic's ever.ciao yaaah69I give it 4/5",Frida
579935,"Tati spent years working on this, the summa of all his comedic direction. PLAYTIME is a study of a day and night in an unrecognizable Paris, where modernist architecture have all but obliterated the city everyone remembers. Tati's point is that this is what urban life has done to Western civilization worldwide (indeed, in the film we frequently see travel posters advertising foreign cities where the same ugly concrete skyscraper appears, blocking out the views of more distinctive landmarks behind it.) But Tati's genius is that he doesn't linger on nostalgia: no matter what has been lost, Tati's characters must move forward and make do with what they've been given. This point is gorgeously made in the film when, fleetingly, the cupolas of Sacre Coeur and the spire of the Eiffel Tower are seen as reflections in glassed doorways. As we see these reflected images, the characters in the film look back at these pre-contemporary landmarks, softly sigh, and then move forward with the modernist Paris they have been given to work in and with.But the pleasure of PLAYTIME is that this modernist Paris may be ugly but it's all a kind of glass-and-cement playground for adults: everything in Tati's Paris is breaking down and is hopelessly confusing, but this is a source of tremendous fun for the viewer--and ultimately, for the film's participants. The story follows Tati's French Everyman, the endearingly clumsy Monsieur Hulot, as his path takes him in and out of a group of American tourists (their dialogue, written by Art Buchwald, becomes most memorable when they visit a technology fair: ""Ooh, and it's so pratical!"" one of them intones, as she watches a model demonstrate new eyeglasses with lift-up lenses for doing one's eyeshadow.) Although Hulot's confusion with modernity inevitably brings chaos in his wake, just about everyone adores him, and by the end of the film he's memorably charmed the prettiest of the tourists. Also by the film's brilliant ending the triumph of this sense of postmodern ""play"" is firmly in place: everytime I see this film I choke up at the end (and can't explain why) when the traffic circle becomes brilliantly transformed (by Tati's brilliant editing and choreography) into a kind of funfair. There's something very moving in seeing that, finally, that Tati reaffirms this landscape of modernity as a space for fun and play, rather than for alienation and disintegration.I was very lucky to have first seen this film in the Eighties on a widescreen, at the Brattle Theatre in Cambridge, Mass. It's just about impossible to see this film this way anymore, and it's a great shame: the widescreen ratio was employed to full use by Tati, and there's often something going on on both sides of the screen that the current DVD format can't pick up. But this is small potatoes: this film is a masterpiece, and deserves to be seen in any format.",Playtime

I expect to see some grain on the film and all in all, I personally am not that disappointed with the picture quality but it all could (and should) have been so much better.To start off with the packaging is a cardboard case that will fall to pieces long before the DVD does. There are no commentaries, no production notes, filmographies, cast/character bios, gallery, outtakes, etc etc. All we get is a static menu, the movie trailer and 20 minutes of interviews with the cast (that were recorded 4 years ago to celebrate the re-release of Grease for it's 20th anniversary in 1998).

868233,"Taliesin Jones, the triumphant first film from Tulsa-based Impact Entertainment to see a national release, differs from mainstream Hollywood films in three ways.  First, it&#65533;s character-driven, which means that the actors have to carry the film by showing character development and growth, instead of dodging bullets and explosions.  Second, it&#65533;s about a thought-provoking philosophical concept &#65533; in this case, the existence and nature of God &#65533; which most movies don&#65533;t even both with anymore.  Third, the way it handles that concept sets Jones apart from other films that attempt the same, and ultimately fail.Jones, from a book by the same name by Welsh author Rhidian Brook, follows its title character (newcomer John-Paul Macleod), a 12-year-old from a broken home in working-class Wales.  His father scrapes out a living by farming, and Taliesin alternately dodges abuse from his bullying older brother and his classmates at school.  Taliesin&#65533;s life is changed when, during his piano lessons, his elderly teacher Billy (the late Ian Bannen in his last role) introduces Billy to faith-healing.  Soon, Taliesin tries the power of prayer on himself and is miraculously cured of warts.  Building a community around faith-healing, Tal&#65533;s belief in this newfound concept of God is shattered when his activities nearly lead to the death of a local diabetic boy.  Afterwards, Taliesin begins to re-examine what he believes and, more importantly, why he believes what he does.The fact that Jones postulates an answer to one of life&#65533;s ultimate philosophical questions isn&#65533;t unique, but what sets it apart is that the movie fails to cave in to simplistic, sound-byte style philosophy.  Those who have done any amount of philosophical inquiry know that life&#65533;s truths cannot be summarized in a quick quote or a simple phrase, and to do so wrecks the beautiful inquiry that makes discovering those truths so unique.  Unlike other recent Christian movie-fare, like Left Behind and The Omega Code, Taliesin Jones offers the audience a journey of experience, and one that it doesn&#65533;t necessarily shove down people&#65533;s throats, either.  Although God is certainly the focus of the film, a belief in a Christian God is just one possible explanation for what happens, and Taliesin&#65533;s personal concept of God develops in a way that leads him from the trappings of religious immaturity to the makings of an adult.Most movies cannot manage to even get the sound-byte philosophy right in two-hours-plus; Jones manages to encapsulate one possible philosophical experience in its brief 95 minutes.  For those of us tired of movies that simply pander and cater, Taliesin Jones is a refreshing break from the mainstream.  The film wouldn&#65533;t have come together without the strength of the actors involved, and the levels of talent that fully realize the characters is also a relief a movie environment increasingly ruled by cardboard stereotypes.  Taliesin Jones is not a film to miss.",N/A

699578,"This is one of those French film that is really about the complexities of interaction between characters and their interactions with the story and milieu that surrounds them.  The milieu here is the fine jewelry trade, about as elite and luxurious as you can get and, as a result, prone to intrigue and corruption.  Caught in the vortex is Catherine Deneuve as the alcoholic wife of the head of the prestigious house of Malivert.  Her husband and brother-in-law have gotten themselves involved in trading stolen jewels which could send them to jail and destroy their house.  When Deneuve's husband commits suicide by driving himself into a logging truck, Deneuve has to sobber up a bit and contemplate a few precious diamonds that he spoke to her about the day before.  Turns out that Deneuve's character has a past and it involves the original distributor of the stolen gems, a man who left her high and dry years before.  The characters and setting make for a sumptuous tale punctuated with real romantic, nostalgic and regretful, longing, the obligatory chills of a thriller and fine acting.

709237,"I glanced at some other reviews here before inscribing my own (which can sometimes be an unhealthy procedure), and noticed a motif that seems to underline most independent reviewers criticism.  They either find the film to far from ""Memento,"" or to close to ""Memento,"" which is beyond explanation on my part. The fact is, Christopher Nolan does an outstanding job with this film, and nothing more nor nothing less should have been done in the creation and editing of this film.  The truth is, this movie isn't much like ""Memento,"" but more like ""Insomnia.""A reviewer here posted that most of the shots are over-stylized, exaggerated, and uncomfortable to watch. Well, I would suppose that the psychological state of insomnia might exactly reflect those very three states.... but on to the movie.Robin Williams and Al Pacino definitely did a great job with this movie, with Al Pacino definitely taking the more impressive role. You really get the feeling that there was a ""trinity"" between Nolan, Pacino, and Williams going on, much like the ""trinity"" which took place in ""Taxi Driver.""I never saw the original ""Insomnia,"" so I am not going to draw comparisons, all I know is that this movie stands by itself as a fantastically dark, thought-provoking film. I will watch the original, just because this movie was so good.A note on the camera angles and stylizied scenes, good job Nolan, you truly did an epic job portraying that vexing state of mind, the light playing, the speeding up and slowing down, the warping of depth, all very well done here, hope to see more of that coming from you.Cant wait for this one to come to DVD...",Insomnia Region 2

259821,"I just saw Red Dragon this weekend. I tried to maintain an open mind as I am a fan of the movie Manhunter. Red Dragon was nicely done using a style similar to Silence of the Lambs. You will see scenes that will definitely spark the comparison and/or tying the movies together. As in Silence Anthony Hopkins will frighten and compell you. I was happy with all the acting. Edward Norton did a nice job but there is no doubt in my mind that William Petersen did a better job in Manhunter. I was also impressed with Ralph Fiennes job of Dolarhyde, but he was no Tom Noonan. Noonan first made me feel compassion for him then he frightened the hell out of me, Fiennes did not. Dennis Farina was a better Cop than Harvey Keitel and Stephen Lang's acting as the obnoxius reporter Freddy Lounds was far better than Phillip Hoffman's rendition. Michael Mann did a brilliant job with the casting, scenes, sets, and music that gave Manhunter a very unique style. Mann's style I think would have been better in the remake than the Brett Ratner version. The characterizations are so real that you can't turn your eyes away. The camera work and visual effects are some of the best you will ever see. This movie is intellectual and shocking. Why Thomas Harris refused to let them call Manhunter ""Red Dragon"" is beyond me. I have read all his books and Manhunter is my favorite movie made from them. If you don't own a copy of Manhunter and you like mysteries like ""Along Came A Spider"", ""Kiss the Girls"", and ""The Bone Collector"", you need to immediately get it.",N/A
40450,"Some reviewers have claimed that this movie is dated and perhaps corny.  I say that this movie isn't dated at all and that perhaps people being bothered by their conscience, while funny in this movie, is something that can still happen.That Touch of Mink is a hysterical movie that pokes a little bit of fun at innocent Doris Day's conscience.  Going around town in Bermuda, you get to see Day thinking to herself ""They all know!"" while she pictures that the elevator she is standing in is actually a canopy bed.  It's funny.  The movie is just good, clean fun.  Something that many will find refreshing in this day of overly action-packed, sex-driven movies.  I hope that someday movie makers will look back on older movies and realize that they can make good movies without boat loads of sex and violence.  That Touch of Mink is a great example.At any rate, I suspect that those interested in purchasing this DVD have already seen and enjoy the movie.  The DVD is letterbox (not widescreen, for those who care), digitally remastered (though some reviewers have argued poorly and I have to agree), and contains a theatrical trailer.

503431,"This delightfully unique movie would have been very, very easy to have marred.  Fortunately, director William Dieterle maintained a light touch throughout, managing just the right mood for each segment of the film.  What could have easily have been hokey instead is eerie and delightful.PORTRAIT OF JENNIE is unique not just for its subject matter, but for being one of the very, very few films of the Hollywood studio era to have been filmed on location in New York.  Almost always in the 1930s and 1940s, a film that was supposedly set in New York or Chicago would in fact be filmed on a Hollywood back lot.  In this case, that would have been a serious blow to the atmosphere of the film, since the numerous scenes shot in Central Park, with the unique skyline framing the park, creates imagery unlike any other film of the time.The cast overall is quite excellent.  Jennifer Jones is not completely believable in her role, but, then, I am not sure many actresses could have been.  She is asked to age too much during the course of the film, and no adult actress is going to be completely believable as small girl and as an adult.  I always love seeing Joseph Cotton in anything, and this was one of his finest romantic roles.  The cast is filled out with a bevy of notable character actresses and actors, such as David Wayne, Lillian Gish, Ethel Barrymore, Florence Bates, Cecil Kellaway, and Henry Hull.The ending is a bit anticlimactic.  The heart of the story is Eben Adams's (Joseph Cotton) meeting Jennie, and the way she changes at each meeting, until he is able to solve her mystery.  The ending was much ballyhooed by Selznick, with the striking tinted waves, but ironically it pales next to the much quieter, but far more emotionally involving, story of a man and a woman.",N/A
661218,"This 77 minute documentary film is interesting.  It takes us on a tour through Ireland, Scotland, England and Cape Breton where we meet several people who share their experiences, visions, sightings and folk stories regarding fairies.  The people we meet are all charming and the scenery in these locations where faery lore is abundant is equally charming.  I thoroughly enjoyed the film.  It was like visiting with my Nana and Grandpa and hearing their tales of the faery realm.  I felt comforted by the honest matter-of-fact way they shared their feelings, ideas and experiences.  They weren't the least bit worried that they might seem far-fetched or unbelievable because in these countries there is healthy respect for the fey.  I enjoyed experiencing that openness and credibility.  I would tell anyone with an interest in faeries or the Celtic world or in magic to check this documentary out.  The reason I only give it three stars is that I didn't feel it was far-reaching enough. It really didn't knock me over in any way.  I would have been happy as can be to have come across it while channel surfing.  I would have certainly considered it a good program and worth the 77 minutes spent viewing it, though some of it was a bit on the dull side.  However, to order it and pay over...for it was too much.  It doesn't contain anything that any student of faery lore hasn't heard a hundred times.  It isn't a film I would watch again because I got the good of it from the one viewing and it's not profound enough or enlightening enough to warrant repeated viewings. If you can rent it or borrow it from a friend, by all means do so, but you can spend...more productively on other faery information or maybe start an account and save up to visit the Celtic countries personally where you can talk to the people and maybe experience the fey yourself.",The Fairy Faith VHS

One assumes her ex will be responsible for the bills or she has been given a handsome settlement that enables her to continue with her life of trivial pursuits.Enter the men. Three thieves.

So why not stay and see how it goes? Duh?Well predictably it doesn't go well. Motivated by the impoverishing divorce where she can now only access millions of dollars instead of tens or hundreds of millions and protecting her chronically wounded daughter, the mother puts up a mythic defense against the sullying patrimony of society.

563977,"There are so many reasons to watch Buffy, it's impossible to list them in a brief precis:  epic scope, mythic resonance, a completely believable variety of diverse characters, witty scripts, sparkling dialogue, wonderfully realized performances, and even a legitimate scare, here and there, along the way.Every season has its own feel and flavor, and its own self-contained story arc.  The first season, needless to say, introduced all the basic characters and situations, emphasizing humor, courage and loyalty.  The Order of Aurelius, headed by the arch-vampire known as The Master, was Buffy's Season One trial, though it properly only covered half the total number of episodes, the rest being filled out by ""incidental"" horrors of the Hellmouth, where the supernatural manifests itself more than in most places of the world.Against The Master and his sinister, apocalyptic vampire Order, are:  Buffy Summers (Sarah Michelle Gellar), the born ""Slayer,"" whose dharma is to be the one girl in all the world equipped from birth with the strength and stamina to thin-out the vampire ranks and prevent their overrunning the world; her watcher, Rupert Giles (Anthony Stewart Head), an introverted British bookworm and surrogate father, whose knowledge and training are invaluable to Buffy; Xander Harris (Nicholas Brendon), a good-hearted unlucky social loser but pithily witty analyst, whose love and loyalty to Buffy elevate him to the rank of unsung hero/helpmeet; and Willow Rosenberg (Alyson Hannigan), a scholarly computer nerd and gentle soul of great innate wisdom.Added assistance are provided by Angel (David Boreanaz), the vampire with a restored soul who becomes the great love of Buffy's life, and reluctant sometime-helper Cordelia Chase (Charisma Carpenter), the most pathologically self-absorbed beauty queen on campus.The balance of horror and humor in the first season is very well managed, and the cast click together with remarkable chemistry and joie de vivre.  The only flaw in these early episodes is the sometimes laughably low budget, though the show beautifully compensates with clever theatrical tricks, the most notable of which is making the underground Order of Aurelius appear much larger and more populated than it is by the use of a multitude of candles and limbo lighting.The best way to get into the magic that is Buffy is from the beginning  -  and this is it.",N/A
272655,"Bigelow's revisionist vampire picture, cowritten with Eric Red, can be lumped in with all those other revisionist vampire pictures.Adrian Pasdar is an aw shucks cowboy in Oklahoma who hooks up with weird girl Mae, played by Jenny Wright (what ever happened to her?). She brings him home to meet the family, who all happen to be vampires. A little love nip gets Pasdar hankering for some blood, and he reluctantly goes along with the band of psychotic human hunters. Pasdar's dad, Tim Thomerson, tracks down Pasdar and takes him back home. A blood transfusion fixes Pasdar right up, but the pack of vampires follows him, kidnapping his sister. A fiery climax ends this weird little film.Lance Henriksen is the leader of the pack, and he is great. He has never received the recognition he deserved, and I wish ""Millennium"" was still on. Bill Paxton plays ""the crazy one,"" the vampire who enjoys killing. In short, is seems to be the same role Paxton plays every other film or so. Pasdar and Wright are okay as the bloodstruck couple, but there is no real body heat between them (so to speak).My problem with this film is this vague lack of spark throughout the film. Everyone goes through the motions, but no one looks like they are really into this. Like Red's other notorious film, ""The Hitcher,"" this film opens badly. I felt like I sat down in the middle of the film, not the beginning. Pasdar and Wright are not given enough time to generate this Romeo and Juliet kind of love they are supposed to be experiencing. The vampire ""family"" are all nuts, and are not given enough time to show any care for each other, which means we eventually do not care either. Thomerson as the veterinarian dad is very good, but again, in an underwritten part.The film certainly looks good. The special and makeup effects are great, especially the infamous scene of a little fifth grader-looking vampire running down a highway in sunlight and bursting into flame. Bigelow's direction is good, if a little sloppy. There are a couple of editing errors, but she does a good job of keeping things going.When you think things are finally clicking, the film makers throw in a silly scene that makes you rethink your previous joy at the film. The blood transfusions and the second kidnapping of Pasdar's sister (really dumb) just provide grist for the mediocrity.Throw in a completely inappropriate musical score by Tangerine Dream, and this film is a definite mixed bag. I recommend ""Near Dark,"" but with some huge reservations.This is rated (R) for strong physical violence, strong gun violence, strong gore, strong profanity, some sexual references, and adult situations.",Near Dark VHS

592267,"There's not much I can say about writer-director Steve Oedekerk's ""Kung Pow: Enter the Fist,"" a spoof on the kung-fu movies of an era gone by that contains jokes, gags, and humor ranging from chuckle-inducing to all-stops-outs belly laughs. As a humorous play on a overly cheesy film genre that only gets goofier with age, the film follows all the necessary rules; the good news is that unlike such a film as, say, ""Scary Movie,"" you don't necessarily have to be acquainted with movies of this sort to appreciate Oedekerk's brand of humor.Using the elements of the digital age to insert himself as a character in the 1976 Hong Kong film ""Tiger and Crane Fist,"" Oedekerk plays The Chosen One, whose family life was stripped from him in his infant years at the hands of Master Pain, who, in the present, adopts the name ""Betty."" Chosen One returns after many years, bent on exacting revenge against Betty.A pretty lame setup, considering the fact that it was the plot of an actual film. What Oedekerk has done is removed the film's main hero and placed himself and various new characters into the film, all the while providing the replacement voices in the redubbiing process.All of this is corny and cheesy, to be sure, but what is most surprising about the movie is how funny it can actually be if you can get into it. The spoofs of ""The Matrix"" and ""The Lion King"" aren't exactly fresh, but they still manage a good deal of hearty chuckles. The bigs laughs come from the Oedekerk's voicing of his character's lady-love, who spends much of her time running around yelling ""wee-ohh;"" the narration of the story, at times, provides humorous commentary on the present situation, and was I the only one who got a kick out of the tongue gag?What's most enjoyable about a movie like ""Kung Pow"" is that its dialogue fits right in with the body language and movements of its characters; at one point, a highly-revered master breaks into a coughing fit during the middle of a discussion. Oedekerk's solution? Insert a fly that will enter his mouth. This, and many of the movie's sight and sound gags, are cheap in their construction and execution, but still manage to provide one with a well-spent 80 minutes of almost-continuous laughter. Wee-ooh!",Kung Pow! Enter the Fist

385706,"This DVD looks like it was produced in such a way that would not make Beatles fans sorry for what they'd already bought. Do you have &quot;The Making of a Hard Day's Night&quot;? Good thing, because that documentary has a lot more interesting stuff than you will find in the extras, here. Do you already have the laserdisc edition of the movie, released in 1987 by Criterion Collection? Good for you, again - that edition had all the songs in STEREO and included &quot;The Running and Jumping and Standing Still Movie&quot; as a bonus.The DVD format, with its menu features, has created a new standard for supplementary material. Instead of one carefully edited documentary that flows smoothly from start to finish, you get several interviews that you can watch in any order. Some of them are quite interesting, in fact. OF COURSE this is a mandatory item for any Beatles collector. Come to think of it, perhaps they did the right thing by not overlapping with previously released stuff. I just hope &quot;The Making of A Hard Day's Night&quot; is still in print, for the sake of those who hadn't bought it. As for the laserdisc, sorry, it's a dead format, anyway.",N/A

When I bought Titanic, the movie sailed away into my heart, I even burst into tears at the end and that does not happen often when I watch a movie. Titanic is truly ""the ship of dreams"".I floated away into the era of pure granduer and magic as Kate Winslet and Leonardo DiCaprio lit up the screen as Jack and Rose, two young lovers who are absolutely crazy for each other. However, love is hard sometimes. Rose's spirit, compared to that of a wild horse roaming the plains, is what draws herself towards Jack, who really thinks she is the greatest girl in the the world.The sunset is my favorite scene where Rose cries out ""I'm flying"" before she and Jack engage in the most endearing kiss.The Titanic then hits a lone iceburg one night.  The scenes are emotional, filled with pure terror, bitterness, and the ever-lasting screams of the dying.  Fifteen hundred will die.  Along with the sinking comes thrilling chases and hardness of envy.  When the ship sinks, Rose and Jack fight for survial, but in the end their love is star-crossed and Jack dies, but at least they are together again after death.A beautiful movie of tenderness, adventure, and the surival to live or die on the Titanic!",Titanic VHS

I'm big on deleted scenes and the like, and there are quite a few here. Most especially, the expanded beginning sequence that shows/tells about the explosion that killed Buckaroo's dad (and features Jamie Lee Curtis).This is a love-it-or-hate it film, to be sure.

327920,"Dave Hirsch (Frank Sinatra), an ex-soldier and writer whose best work is in his past, returns to his small-town roots only to be confronted by hypocrisy at every turn.  Every element of this meandering drama is predictable and every character a stereotype.  We never get under the skin of Sinatra's character to understand why he is so moody and brooding, thereby compromising his role as a foil for the community at large.  It was difficult to understand the intense loyalty he provokes in the gambler Bama (Dean Martin) and the floozy Ginny (Shirley MacLaine).  Magnificent work by MacLaine and supporting actor Arthur Kennedy, as Sinatra's brother, are not enough to save the film.  The climax is overwrought and predictable.",Some Came Running VHS
476818,"The story element in this movie is good, the fight scenes are typical Jet Li quality (amazing), but the picture quality is so poor it is ridiculous. The picture is never clear, the colors appear as if they were applied with a big crayon, almost pastel in texture and color. The subtitles were just plain terrible. There is a good 3 to 5 minute narrative at the begining of the film that is not subtitled at all, so if you don't happen to speak Cantonese (which I don't) you have to switch the language, this also happens during the film itself, especially during one of the last fight scenes, sure they are talking but there are no subtitles.For some obsqure reason though the sound quality is better than most films of it's age. I've seen a lot of cantonese films from the 70's and 80's in the past few years, and typically it is almost impossible to understand any of what they are saying even if you do speak the language. This has been one of the clearest audio tracks I have heard in a while... I acctually even picked up a few new words (that I will promptly forget before I get the chance to use them).",Shaolin Temple (World Video)
225993,"This film, directed by Ridley Scott, is without a doubt one of finest science fiction films ever.  Resultantly, it is also one of the most effective horror films as well.The casting for the film is excellent.  While Scott was going for the ""truck drivers in space"" look, he succeeded in accidentally finding the perfect middle ground.  Obviously actors aren't going to be as un-photogenic as real truck drivers, but at least his goal moved the casting away from Beautiful People Syndrome that plagues other projects.  This is further built upon with a very ""lived in"" large industrial towing spaceship.  Their clothing also looked used and functional, rather than the product of artistic fashion/costume designers.  I'm struck by how Russian everything looks: the laced-up underclothing that goes under the pressure suit, the space-suit's big round helmet, the woven-cloth insulated wiring on the self destruct controls, etc.  The name Nostromo may also be further evidence that the production designers looked to the Russians for inspiration.  Considering that nation was (and still is) more practical and successful in extended-duration space missions, this reflects well on the filmmakers.Another nice addition was the mention of Zeta Reticuli, which in the alien phenomenon field is synonymous with their home planet as supposedly claimed by the Betty Hill case.  Interestingly, it was not Betty Hill who said that, but a public school teacher & astrologer who erroneously tried to match Hill's star map to known constellations.  The fact that this is completely bogus even if one hypothetically thought there were little gray men does not detract from the film, but is yet another goody for the attentive viewer, especially for one released in 1979.With all these positive comments, it is important to point out how they are presented to the audience.  The acting is very good.  The dialog is always realistic chatter, not the obviously scripted lines of most films.  Multiple characters are often speaking at the same time and there is a sense of room ambience, perhaps because much of the audio was recorded live on set (or evidence of how good the ADR and foley people were).  Much of this chatter is already seemingly underway when the scene switches to it, as if we are observing real events.  With a horror element that is already expertly managed, all of this serves to heighten our involvement in the movie and help us empathize with the characters.",Alien VHS

721587,"I haven't seen any versions of ""Alice"" that match up with what is in my mind. Disney tried vewwy hard and it is a nice, clinical and somewhat sterile interpretation (with some early celebrity flavor in it, as we would see come to blossom in the 1960's with the movies from ""101 Dalmations"" on up). However, I am not reviewing that movie, nor THIS! I am putting in a teeny vote for the 1930's (1933, I think...or maybe '35) version, which had (actually, mebbe it was '36?) W.C.

I stayed home from school in 1975 to watch this film because I had read so much about it in my books on Cary Grant and also WC Fields [plus some other starz!whoze namez! ezcape!me]). Ok, enough. Suffice to say, the 1930's version was pretty neat, and had many of the best special FX guys of the 30's working on it. Put in a vote for the early 1930's version to be released at least on DVD.

399371,"I keep trying to write reviews about this movie, and they either get lost, or I get interrupted. But I'm determined to add my 2 cents about this great movie because I feel so strongly about Jennifer Jason Leighs miraculous performance. She is touched by God (or Satan), because she so totally immerses herself into her role as ""Sadie"", that there is not a hint of ""acting."" She so perfectly captures those downed-out girls I saw in punk clubs in the '70's & '80's (where are THEY now??), and her slide down the gutter of addiction is so real, you may find yourself trying to wipe the droul off your t.v. screen. Sadie's pathetic attempts to ""be somebody"", in light of her sister, ""Georgia"", who not only has ""respectable"" fame, but, a seemingly stable family..etc, is heartbreaking to behold. The nuances of her portrayal are newly un-covereed at each viewing, leaving you just shaking your head in amazement at her performance. I'm surprised some viewers found her interpretation ""mannered"", to put it kindly. Because I recognized her mannerisms, her sad creation of a ""Sadie"" to hide the real hurt inside,as traits I have seen in many troubled people I have known. Hey, you either get it, or you don't. I have always admired Ms. Leighs work, always thought she was an exceptional actress, but this role just ""blew me away"", for want of a better phrase. I don't want to take anything away from all the other actors, stars, superstars, commercial draws, etc..., out there in ""La-La Land"", but this girl is SO much more of an artist, wonder, PRESENCE, that 99% of the others should just forget it. She makes you realize what true talent is, not just a bunch of hype.I almost feel bad about going on about her, because this movie also has one of my all-time favorite actresses,the incredibly gifted Mare Winningham.Her ""Georgia"" is a very subtle, perfect contrast, to J.J.Leighs ""Sadie.""I've always hoped Oliver Stone would make a film of another one of the handful of people who had true, God-given talent, Janis Joplin, and that Mare Winningham would star. She would be perfect. If you can ever get your hands on her early work ""Off The Minnesota Strip""(?), do so, as it is a precursor of J.J.Leighs role as Sadie.She is miraculous in it. The supporting players are all very good also in Georgia, especially John Doe, of ""X"" fame. (One of the best bands EVER!!)They all contribute to make a film which will take you on an emotional ride, no...it's not ""happy"", but, it's worth the trip.You will be in awe at the wonder of the living, breathing, ""Sadie.""",Georgia VHS

593036,"MEN IN BLACK II is not nearly as good as the original, but after seen all the horrible reviews, I was expecting to really dislike it. Fortunately, it wasn't bad at all. Great? No. Horrible? No.The only way that MEN IN BLACK II can be considered a bad movie is in direct comparison with the original. If one were to see this one, never having seen the first, I think the experience would be a very pleasurable one. Will Smith is as likable in this one as in the first, and I enjoyed a lot of the accoutrements from the original are back. Tony Shaloub, one of my favorite character actors, reprises his role as Jack Jeebs, and provides some funny moments. Rosario Dawson was fine in her role, though it could have been a expanded with ease. And Lara Flynn Boyle made a believable and successful villainous. My one disappointment was with Tommy Lee Jones, who I almost always love. His performance was fine, but the script doesn't do nearly as much with his memory loss as they might have, and the completely sudden way he gets his memory back makes for a rough transition. I felt Frank the Pug and the worm guys could have had slightly (or even much) smaller roles.I would recommend this to anyone who enjoyed the original, as long as they realize that it isn't as good as the first one.",N/A

665700,"...then, hooo-boy did you pick the wrong movie.This is a quiet, charming little character piece with no sex, no explosion, and real people doing real things.For anyone born after 1962, it will be a revelation of how important the world thought it was to land on the moon. A history lesson, of a time out of memory or before you were born.For those born earlier, this movie fulfills a dual function. It is a delightfully funny movie with dozens of interesting offbeat characters, and an intelligent plot. It is also the only film I've ever seen that accurately captures the often miserable broadcast quality of the moon landings. Most documentaries and films use footage that the astronauts themselves took on either film or better quality video. The actual broadcast we baby boomers saw live was a shadowy, grainy, nearly indecipherable mess.Filmed on location on the 200-ft wide dish where the events took place, this movie scores big on the little touches: the security guard who is convinced that's Neil Armstrong on his walkie-talkie, the rather unusual selection for the American National Anthem, the cadet hopelessly infatuated with the mayor's rebel daughter, the father who has to keep asking his 8-year old son about the technical details of the moon launch. (Anyone who lived through the time knows how spot on that situation was.) The music choices, ranging from the Australian classic ""The Real Thing"" by Russel Morris to ""Good Morning Starshine"" by Oliver, are accurate for the era and appropriate.Give yourself about 10 minutes into the film to get adjusted to the sometimes thick Australian accents, and you be pleasantly rewarded for your investment.",N/A

The choir voices from the radio while all this is going on is quite effective.The second stars Ian Hendry who deserts his family to run off with his lover but is involved in a car crash which disfigures him. He eventually finds his own way back home to discover his lover is blind from the accident and that he is not too good shape himself when catching a glimpe of himself in a glass table.The third stars the excellent Peter Cushing in a touching and even tear jerking performance as an old man who commits suicide after his rich neighbout attempts to drive him out of his house. A year later he takes his revenge in a superb climax to the story.Story number 4 Richard Greene goes bankrupt and his very silly wife decides to use an old Chinese figurine that grants three wishes to get the money back. Things don't go to plan of course and Greene ends up dead. Won't ruin the film by telling you what happens next. But this is perhaps the most psychologically terrifying sequence i have ever seen.

After CAPTAIN BLOOD proved to be such a gold mine, Warner Bros. put writer Delmer Daves to work adapting another Rafael Sabatini novel THE SEA HAWK; it ranks as one of Flynn's best all-round films, and remains a beautiful picture to see and hear. The 1.7 million dollar budget was lavish by 1940 standards; an enormous new sound stage was inaugurated for the film. Two newly built full-scale ships - one 165' long, the other 135' - both surrounded by 12 feet of water (!) helped make the opening of the movie an amazing, crammed-with-detail piece of filmmaking. The musical score by Erich Wolfgang Korngold was his last for an historical pageant and one of his best; his score splendidly captures the ""sweep and roll"" of 16th century ships. It's interesting to compare Flora Robson's interpretation of Queen Elizabeth I to Bette Davis's. Both are intelligent and convincing, but Robson conveys level-headedness with flashes of temper while Davis (in THE PRIVATE LIVES OF ELIZABETH AND ESSEX, which she made with Flynn one year prior) projects distinctly neurotic and indecisive aspects of her character. Flynn's performance is good and believable; he chose a relatively quiet, restrained delivery here and he was at the apex of his career both looks and performance-wise. The term was ""sea dogs"" was conveniently changed to ""sea hawks"", thereby refuting history and confusing Sabatini buffs, but giving a 'raison d'etre' to the saleable and dramatic title the studio decided to retain.

As expected, this sci-fi adventure is excellent in the visual department, with stunning vistas, brilliantly-conceived worlds, and awe-inspiring and frightening alien creatures. The action sequences are amazing, and the final half-hour delivers simply the best large-scale battle scene in ANY fantasy/adventure (as everybody knows, it concludes with a fight between a dark Jedi and Yoda in a duel that has to be seen to be believed). The dialogue is spotty, but the performances are convincing and earnest (Ewan Mcgregor stands out as Kenobi, and Samuel L. Jackson creates a fierce, honorable warrior in Mace Windu) and the story is interesting and suspenseful.

486039,"I purchased ""Two-Lane Blacktop"" because of a review by Leonard Maltin stating that Warren Oates should have received the Oscar for his role.  I was not let down.  The movie is ostensibly about drag racing, with a cross-country race being waged.  More broadly, the movie addresses the American fascination with speed and excitement.  More importantly, it is a prime example of the type of small American movies that flourished in the 1970s, but are not being made today.  James Taylor and Dennis Wilson star in their only primary acting roles of their careers, and bring a low-key realism to the movie.

683757,"In ""Bubble Boy,"" Jake Gyllenhaal plays Jimmy, a teen who suffers from severe immune deficiency, and is forced to come of age in the confines of a plastic bubble, set up in his parents' suburbia home.  Jimmy is smothered by his obsessively religious mother (Swoozie Kurtz), and doesn't seem to mind till he meets Chloe, the beautiful girl who visits from next door, whom he becomes very close to, and falls in love with.  When Chloe goes off  to get married, Jimmy decides he must pursue her, so he fashions himself a ""travel bubble"" and goes off in search of his true love across the country.Along the way, he meets a wide range of nutty characters, including the performers of a freak circus, the members of a religious cult, a motorcycle gang, and assorted other oddballs.  Gyllenhall (who starred in Donnie Darko as as of late) brings a genuinely sweet and charming quality to his performance as the heroic Jimmy much like Johnny Depp in Tim Burton's Edward Scissorhands.Some folks may find it offensive, some of the humor is pretty over the top, but if you take it for what it is, good silly fun, I think you'll find it charming.  To me, the film was totally appealing and very entertaining, in a Tim Burton Pee Wee Big Adventure kinda way.  I laughed myself silly!",N/A
537039,"Let me start by asking you a question.  When DVD's came out, weren't you happy that a long movie like 'Titanic' would be able to fit on one DVD and not split into two discs like on video?  I'm sure you would answer yes, so that begs the question, what is the purpose of splitting 'Pearl Harbor' onto 2 DVD's?  It is stupid if you ask me.  That is the only reason why I gave this 1 star rather than 3.The movie itself was ok.  The special effects were good, but you could tell that they were special effects, and that always detracts from my enjoyment of a film.  I thought the story was really two movies in one, a love story and a war story.  Each one would have been great on its own, but mixed together they just make for a long movie.  I also thought that Ben Affleck was not that good, and over acted for most if not all of the film.I would not suggest buying this DVD because the film is split onto two disks, and the movie was not that great. Hope this helps you stay away from this purchase.",N/A
298927,"After the success of BACK TO THE FUTURE, a slew of movies about time travel were produced and released. None have ever reached the level of excitement and humor yet without breaking continuity with time travel theory than that film did. Some of the films made were decent, some were terrible, and some were just incredibly funny.  BILL AND TED'S EXCELLENT ADVENTURE was one the funniest time travel films and was a huge hit.Bill and Ted are two California high school losers who can't even play instruments but have a band called ""Wyld Stallions"" (Bill and Ted introduced air guitar to the rest of America outside of LA). The duo want to learn to play and stuff, but they have to graduate from high school and in order to do that they have to get an A+ on their history final.Enter Rufus (George Carlin). Rufus is from the future, a future where peace reigns thanks to the music of Bill and Ted. However, if they don't pass that final, all of Rufus' society will be wiped into oblivion. So, he let's the bumbling duo borrow his time traveling phone booth (anybody seen Doctor Who) and travel throughout history picking up famous people to help them with their report.  Abe Lincoln, Sigmund Freud, Genghis Khan, Joan of Arc, Billy the Kid, Beethoven, and Napolean are all along for the ride. But while Bill and Ted have to find Napolean (ditched by his babysitter) the men and woman of history run wild in the mall and are arrested.The movie is hilarious. True it is totally anachronistic and doesn't follow time travel theory at all, but because it never takes itself seriously, one can relish in the humor. The movie haunted Keanu Reeves' career and the surfer in the actor never left him until he made THE MATRIX. And the rest is, as they say, history.",N/A
415679,"I was only two years old in 1964, but I do know the year as a watershed era in rock music, because that was the year both the Beatles *and* Motown came to the American culture- via television. That said, what really impresses me about ""TTYD"" are the small touches. Director Tom Hanks has been quoted as saying that the songs by Adam Schlesinger (and score by Howard Shore) are original songs- that is, they were written for this film, but they were made, in tempo and arrangement, to *sound* like they came out of the 60's. That's amazing- especially when you re-listen to them. Also impressive are various bits of the day-glo color cinematography, art direction, set pieces (like the Play-Tone 'big record' stage), and even some of the co-stars in their cross country tour (the singer of ""Mr. Downtown"" paying an obvious tribute to Johnny Rivers, and the beautiful ""Chantrellines"" trio a spot-on amalgam of the Crystals, Shirelles, and the Supremes, right down to the coiffed wigs, dresses, hand-claps, and position of the microphones).(P.S.: While I enjoyed Tom Everett Scott immensely, I don't see the resemblance to Tom Hanks that everyone's talking about.

A review on the box said it was a ""psychological thriller in the style of the Blair Witch Project"". So I rented it. I was willing to give it the benefit of the doubt for most, if not all, of the movie. I quite enjoyed the psychological elements of the movie, although my friend did note that the characters spent most of the first half of the movie talking. It was interesting talk, at least. I loved the psychological sessions, and particularly the character of Billy. Princess was good, too. Then there was Simon. I'm not sure how much I can say about where the movie went wrong without giving too much away, but I'll try. At the end of the movie it turns out that it wasn't really a psychological thriller at all. Oh, no, no, no. It turns out it was a... * spoiler alert * case of demonic possession. Well, at least it was an excuse to * spoiler alert * kill off most of the main characters. What occurred to me at the movie's end was that the movie had been ambitious, and the director had clearly tried hard to make it a good movie. Good effort. They almost made it.",Session 9

388819,"Great series, great actors... You could not go very wrong with an adaptation of such a classical masterpiece as P&amp;P, provided that you only follow the book, and this series does exactly that.Without delving too much on the plot and the excelent performances delivered by all actors, I'm just going to note a few differences from the book:1. There is a scene added while Lizzy is at Netherfield tending her sister, which shows Darcy watching her as she plays with a dog from an upper window. This is added to show how his interest in her is piqued.2. There is a scene added right before Lizzy meets Mr. Darcy at Pemberley, showing him training in duel and then taking a bath in the river by the house. I think those were added to show his state of mind and his inner struggle with his feelings. They were good and did nothing wrong to the character.3. The involment of Mr. Darcy in Lydia's wedding is shown as we go along, instead of Lizzy discovering it from her aunt's letter. I liked it better when it was all a surprise right up the moment she got the letter.4. The ending is a little rushed; after Lizzy and Darcy confess their love, we are taken almost directly to the wedding day. We don't see the scene where Lizzy tells her mother about the upcoming wedding, and that scene was great. Also, all the 'future' developments Ms. Austen suggests for the characters -- like Mr. Bennett constantly visiting his daughters, Lydia and Wickham coming to visit, Lydia's letters -- are not included.And two other things:The actress who plays Jane is not as beautiful as she should have been. She acts very well, however.Finally, I gave this DVD four stars not because of the movie -- which despite its flaws is a full 5 star -- but because it has no subtitles. Dialogue is one of the most important aspects in this movie, and with the old English phrasing it was sometimes dfficult to follow, because of the absence of the subtitles.",Jane Austen's Pride and Prejudice Six Piece Collector's VHS
538058,"The idea behind ""Along came a Spider"" is that the director, Lee Tamahori, wants to manipulate and surprise his audience...he does this perfectly.  ""Along came a Spider"" has more twists (exclude the pun) than a spider web.  This, of course, makes most people want to go back and check out each character and see how it all envelops in the end.  It's very confusing, but makes almost perfect sense...well, almost.""Along came a spider"" is the sequel to ""Kiss the Girls""...or maybe it's a prequel?  You don't know.  The one thing you do know is that Dr. Alex Cross, the shady and ruthless detective, is back, reprised by the talented Morgan Freeman.  The beginning of the film is kinda farfetched and silly, when a car flips in the air like a board game dice and holds on by a thread over a dam.  It almost seems like the car has a mind of it's own!  Anyways, Dr. Cross has filed for retirement after his partner was killed in that car, after a sting operation went very bad.  Meanwhile, a international catastrophe goes out of control, when the daughter of a US senator is kidnapped by her teacher and posted as ransom.  The kidnapper, named ""Mr. Soneji"" (played perfectly by Michael Wincott) has unknown objectives to the kidnapping.  Meanwhile, Dr. Cross is thrusted back into action when Soneji calls him at home, wanting to play a game.  Cross is partnered up with a special agent Jezzie (played by Monica Potter) who's is to blame for Megan's (the girl) kidnapping, due to lack of security.  The two go out on the case, searching for Soneji, while the really plot starts to unveal about half-way through the film.ACAS is thrilling and suspenseful.  The only problem is that much of the climax doesn't exactly explain anything.  Most of all, the reason I said it was a ""international"" catastrophe, was because around somewhere in the film, Morgan's friend is the son of the Russian Embassador.  Obviously the Russians are stuck up and act like all of them have a stick up their [end].  In this case, in one scene, Alex and Jezzie stop Soneji from taking Morgan's friend from outside the Russian Embassy.  They almost have Soneji while he's getting away, but then the Russian Embassy guards come out and go postal on the two detectives, as if they were the assisins!  Nevermind.",N/A

541896,"Brilliantly directed by Christopher Nolan, who also wrote the screenplay based on a short story by his brother, Jonathan Nolan, this film had to be a huge challenge for all.  The word ""memento"" means ""remember"" in Latin, and the story is about Leonard, so traumatized by a blow to the head after his wife's rape and murder, that he has lost his short-term memory. He's out for revenge and is looking for the killer, but, although he remembers his life with his wife and who he is, he cannot remember anything that has happened since.  He therefore takes Polaroid shots of everyone he meets and writes notes on them.  And he also tattoos things he wants to remember all over his body. The role calls out for an exceptional actor and Guy Pearce certainly does rise to the occasion.  I found myself drawn to him, identifying with his condition, and joining him in his struggle to relate to the world.The story unfolds backwards, an unusual narrative technique that is tricky to use.  We see a scene and think we understand.  And then there is another scene that has happened prior to it, and it totally changes our perception of what is going on.  Purposely, it is confusing.  And purposely, there are moments of clarity where it all fits together only to become even more confusing in the next scene.  Carrie Ann Moss plays a femme fatal and, as we get to know her, we are not quite sure what her motives are.  Joe Pantolino is cast as in the role of Leonard's buddy, and we are constantly confused as to whether he is friend or foe.I sat there fascinated as this complicated plot unfolded, enjoying the mastery in which the director led me down different avenues of thought and also introduced questions about the moral issues involved.  By the end, I was absolutely sure of nothing at all, except that I had been traveling on a roller coaster of an experience that didn't have any easy answers.  While I tend to want films to have a beginning, middle and end, and a story line that is easy to follow, this an exception to the rule.  I definitely recommend to those who are willing to explore this unique film, which is certainly one of a kind.",Memento VHS
511794,"Transformers The Movie had a lot of competion in the dawn of animated TV-to-movie era. It was in competition with the GI Joe Movie and the Robotech Movie. But out of all of them, Transformers was the only one that stood the test of time.The movie begins in the year 2005 when Cybertron has been taken over by the Decepticons. While Ironhide makes a special shuttle run to Autobot City on Earth, the shuttle is hijacked by Megatron and the other Decepticons. Once hearing of this, Optimus Prime rushes to earth to assist the other Autobots in combat. However, Optimus bites the big one as well as Megatron once Starscream throws him out into space. Soon, Megatron meets the gigantic Unicron and is offered a second chance to destory the matrix.Many fans of Transformers were a bit angry at the fact that so many characters were killed off in the movie. The reason for that was because they saw that in GI Joe, Duke dies, but it was edited out. The writers thought that would be cool and have a greater impact so they went overboard with it. There were too many characters to begin with anyway.This version is the special so called ""PG"" version that was originally released in theaters. I call it the PG version because once it was discovered that Danny's father says the S word in the PG version, they released an unrated edited version that includes a Star-Wars-esque opening. I like this version way better than that of the edited version that was released by FHE. The all-star voice cast includes a range of great celebrities. You may remember Peter Cullens (Optimus Prime) as the announcer for Toonami trailers. Some more famous names are Lenord Nemoy, Robert Stack (Unsolved Mysteries), Scatman Crothers (Roots), Orson Welles (his last film I should mention) and Eric Idle (Monty Python) although you can bearly understand a word he is saying since his voice is distorted in the film.Extras on here are pretty slim, but good extras at that. The first is an interview with Vince DiCola, the composer for Transformers. It's pretty long and mentions a lot of stuff about going through the process of composing music for Transformers. The second extra is a bunch of unused storyboards. These were fun to look at especially since there are descriptions on each storyboard. I would have liked it better if Rhino had included all the Transformers movie trailers.Overall, this is the best version of Transformers The Movie that easily overpowers the Laser Discs.

106472,"Meredith Willson's &quot;The Music Man&quot; was a phenomenal success on Broadway (1957) before it came to Hollywood.  At this point in time, in Hollywood musical history, studios wanted to be certain that they had a &quot;sure thing&quot; before they expended any amount of money on the musical.  Consequently, most of the musicals being made in Hollywood had previously been successful on Broadway.  The same principle applied to &quot;The Music Man.&quot;Director Morton DaCosta and choreographer Onna White also handled the Broadway production and several of the original Broadway cast members were featured in the movie including Pert Kelton, The Buffalo Bills singing quartet and last but not least Robert Preston.  Even though Preston portrayed the dynamic Professor Hill on Broadway, he was awarded the starring role in the movie only after Cary Grant turned down the studio.  Preston's enthusiastic character in the movie, his style, his charm and his personality reflected in Professor Hill are the qualities that went on to make the movie as successful as the Broadway play.  According to Ted Sennett in his book 'Hollywood Musicals,' &quot;His performance is a miracle of energy and drive, perfectly in key to the style and intention of the film.&quot;&quot;The Music Man&quot; centers on down home America, Iowa style, circa 1912.  The crux of the plot involves a fast-talking, good looking, and smooth kind of guy called Professor Harold Hill.  In actuality, he's a con man who goes from small town to small town, making a fast buck.  However, when he arrives in River City, he doesn't realize that he has met his Waterloo.  He proceeds in trying to convince these small town folks that there's 'trouble right here in River City,' referring to the young people who are hanging around with nothing to do.  He puts himself across as a music teacher and tries to get all of the parents to buy band instruments and uniforms in order to form a band that he can instruct.  Wanting to do the best for their children, parents go along with his suggestion, not realizing that he knows nothing about music, bands or band instruments.  Marian (Shirley Jones), the town's librarian sees through his faade but also at the same time, falls in love with him.  The movie ends with the famous song '76 trombones.'The songs in this movie flowed smoothly with the storyline and there was something for everyone.  The production number &quot;The Wells Fargo Wagon&quot; involved members of the whole town, looking and waiting for the Wells Fargo Wagon to deliver all the things that were ordered from the catalogue.  Children and adults alike were all excited about the arrival, which was a big happening in this little town. Robert Preston's rendition of 'Trouble' set the tone for the movie and showed, in music, how he could incite the townspeople and get just what he wanted.  Shirley Jones and Robert Preston vocalizing on 'Till There Was You' made it very clear that they cared deeply for one another and the audience knew, at that point, that he wasn't going to leave River City.  The grand finale, with the marching band playing '76 Trombones' was really the high point of the movie and &quot;...the musical's biggest hit song...which Preston makes virtually his own with every confident stride and strut&quot; (Ted Sennett, &quot;Hollywood Musicals&quot;).  It's a song in the movie where you just had to join in with the music.&quot;The Music Man&quot; is two and a half hours of sheer pleasure. Yes, it was corny, but so were a lot of other musicals.  Maybe that's what made it so appealing.  If it didn't have the staying power it wouldn't be around today, being shown repeatedly on television and being sold on videocassette and DVD.  Robert Preston and Shirley Jones will always be fondly remembered for their excellent portrayals in this movie.",N/A

28933,"With trips to the summit of Everest now quite routine, there are no more places on the surface of the Earth left to explore. The greatest feat of exploration of the past century was the manned landing on the moon. However, it was more a feat of technology than a voyage of discovery. In the nineteenth century, the greatest feat of exploration in North America was the journey of the corps of discovery, where Meriwether Lewis and William Clark led a small expedition up the Missouri river and over land to the Pacific ocean. Sent by President Jefferson shortly after the Louisiana Purchase, their mandate was to map, gather scientific data on the wildlife, search for a Northwest passage to the Pacific and to make contact with the native American inhabitants.  Amazingly, they did all three, being more successful than even the greatest of optimists could have foreseen.Retracing their journey and interspersed with dramatic reenactments, this tape is truly history in action. With no possibility of relief arriving for years, they were required to live on what they could carry as well as what they could find on the land or obtain from the natives. What was most interesting about the tape is the descriptions of their relationships with the various tribes they encountered. Truly, without the active assistance of several tribes, they would have starved to death or have been forced to turn back. In fact, a Shoshone woman named Sacagawea traveled with them for most of the journey, carrying her infant son every step of the way. It is a tribute to Lewis and Clark that they kept such accurate and honest journals. From them, we can learn what happened, and there is no hint of personal embellishment in their writings. In hearing these accounts, you cannot help but wonder if the native tribes understood that their world had changed forever, and of course not for the better.I have traveled most of their route by vehicle, and when you move up the mountains, you cannot help but be impressed by how difficult it was for them to move over them by horseback. Keep in mind that they were also carrying extensive munitions, goods for trade and other miscellaneous necessities. Furthermore, there was only one fatality among the members of the corps, and that was most likely appendicitis, something that no medical person on the planet could have successfully treated.The journey of Lewis & Clark irrevocably changed the social structure of half of what is now the continental United States. This tape is an accurate historical account of their adventure and should be a requirement for graduation from high school.",N/A

547281,"A good war film, about the creation of the modern Israeli army and the creation of the state of Israel.  Kirk Douglas plays a recently demobilized American military expert who returns home from WWII only to find he still has fighting and wanderlust in his blood.  A cloak-and-dagger offer to help train the beleagured Jewish militias is all he needs to tell his wife, ""honey, I'll write you soon!"" and zip off to the promised land.  The film is very one-sided and romanticized, yet compelling... In retrospect, historians have argued that the Israelis weren't as badly outgunned in 1948 as the official version implies, but I'm sure it was still bad enough.  Guest appearances by John Wayne, Frank Sinatra (who phoned in role as a happy-go-lucky fighter pilot) and Yul Brynner make this a bona fide Epic Film, but you might find your attention wandering more towards the Sophia Loren-alike hottie, Senta Berger, who plays Kirk's Israeli love interest.

147855,"On second viewing, ""Fargo""'s fun and surprises diminish considerably. A black comedy set against a stark and desolate white snowscape, the Coen brothers' film registers its effects through three primary devices: the variation on film noir conventions, the constant juxtaposition of incongruities, the opportunistic use of local color. But most of the film's success depends less on cinematic originality than on the colorful, memorable performances of Frances McDormand, William Macy, and Steve Buscemi. Shot mostly in cars and tight interiors, ""Fargo"" is neither a northern epic nor an intricately plotted Warners Brothers crime yarn. It's a ""three actor"" drama that, in the end, comes up somewhat short in credibility, depth, and meaning.While Ingmar Bergman's Swedes use the desolate landscape as a theatrical stage for poignant meditations on the existence of God and the meaning of human existence, the Coen brothers' characters are pretty much clueless about anything beyond eating, sleeping, and getting on with life. The characters' ""yah's,"" ""you betcha's,"" and ""thanks a bunches,"" while fully recognizable localisms on first viewing, seem overdone the second time around (in fact, this time the performance of the two prostitutes struck me as the stuff of a ""Saturday Night Live"" skit).I wouldn't mind seeing the film yet another time, provided it was in the presence of someone who hadn't seen it. But one almost wishes the Coen brothers could have consulted Garrison Keillor on the script of this project, in which case genuine characters might have replaced the caricatures the film serves up. Or maybe it would have been enough if they had simply tuned into some of those NPR Saturday night broadcasts. They would have discovered that the people of Lake Wobegon know something the filmmakers apparently do not--that the unexamined life is unfit to be lived.",N/A

543124,"I hesitated to see this film because having seen my share of Kristen Dunst movies, I wasn't sure I was ready for another teen sugar attack.  However, this film turned out to be a pleasant departure from the perky candy coated parts Dunst has played in the past.  In fact, this might be a watershed role for her, marking her transition from teen roles to adult roles.Dunst plays Nicole Oakley, a troubled teenager from a privileged family who falls in love with Carlos (Jay Hernandez), a boy from the wrong side of the tracks.  The story is nothing new, but the presentation is remarkably good, with far greater maturity than one would expect from a high school flick.This film is exceptional considering its limited budget and the fact that most of the major players have very little experience at this level.  For writers Phil Hay and Matt Manfredi, this is their first feature film screenplay.  For director John Stockwell, it is only his second feature film.  Likewise for Jay Hernandez and Taryn Manning.  Many of the Latino actors were cast from a local high school, so they are in their first film.  By comparison, Kirsten Dunst is a jaded veteran.  The use of so many ordinary (not professional actors) high school students in the film gives it a very genuine look and feel.Stockwell turns in an impressive directorial effort with a story that is much more complex than it seems at first blush.  It starts out as your standard boy-meets-girl love story.  They flirt, act silly, have sex, fall in love and create beautiful romantic images on the beach.  Just when you think it is going to be a real yawner, things begin to get complicated.  Stockwell slowly peels away the layers of the two main characters and their families to reveal subterranean shearing forces that will act to tear them apart.Nicole, who at first seems to be just a wild, rebellious brat, turns out to be far deeper and more emotionally unsettled than one would ever imagine.  Carlos' humble roots and burning ambition bring the relationship to a breaking point when he has to decide between Nicole and his shot at Annapolis.  Stockwell takes what could have been a trite teen romance and turns it into an engaging character study.  While his pace is perhaps a bit too deliberate and inclusive, his sensitive treatment of the motivation of the characters and his style of unraveling their psyches slowly before our eyes makes for great drama.  This film is full of ""ahah"" moments, where you find yourself re-evaluating the characters as some new piece of information is revealed.Kirsten Dunst has had an active career, appearing in over twenty films before the age of twenty (which age she will attain in April 2002).  This is by far her best performance, helped by the fact that it is the most complex character she has ever played.  There was a hint that her ability extended beyond the superficial teen characters she normally plays in the film ""Virgin Suicides"", where she played a sullen, bad girl with some serious problems.  As Nicole in this film, she shows us that she has extraordinary range.  She really cuts loose with the character, taking her to exhilarating and uninhibited highs as well as crashing, depression ridden lows.  Though this is a minor film from a box office perspective, this performance should get the attention of casting directors and open the door for her to get bigger, more serious parts.  Jay Hernandez shows promise, although he seems a little wooden in this film.  His great strength (other than his obvious good looks) is his sincerity.  He comes across as if he means every word he says.I was going crazy trying to figure out where I had seen Bruce Davidson (who played Tom Oakley) before.  He played Willard in the film of the same name (1971) about a sociopathic kid who befriended rats and used them to attack his enemies.  Davidson gives a good performance here as Nicole's congressman father, particularly in the touching scene at the end.Herman Osario, Miguel Castro and Tommy De La Cruz were all cast for their first film in open auditions from thousands of Latino high school students.  They provide the film with some of its lighter moments as Carlos' friends, and they all give fantastic performances, basically being themselves.  Taryn Manning rounds out the cast as Nicole's best friend and does a fine job of playing the wild thing.I liked this film more for the drama than the romance.  I rated it an 8/10.  Kirsten Dunst takes a quantum leap with this performance.  It is not for impatient viewers or those who despise slushy romances.  However, for those who like a good character study with emotionally charged content and complex characters it is well worth a look.",Crazy/ Beautiful
590626,"but it's his performance that makes this movie.  A Beautiful Mind is an engaging film.  Not a great movie, but a very good one.  As has become rather expected in movies by the &quot;better&quot; American directors, the ending is pure schmaltz.  I presume studio pressure had a lot to do with it--which is an excuse that is unavailable to Mr. Speilberg, who has transformed himself into the king of schmaltzy endings.  But, I digress.Part of Crowe's approach to acting is to notice and replicate certain &quot;tics&quot; that become the nucleus around which his performance can spin, react, and coalesce.  But, unlike many lesser actors, these &quot;tics&quot; do not devolve into cliches.  He uses them as windows into the character's soul.  Here, John Nash's fingers do a figure eight on his forehead when the stress around him builds.  It's as if he is both shielding himself from the world and also wishing away demons with some arcane incantation.  Crowe's portrait of a man transformed by events beyond his control should have earned him an Oscar.  This truly was the performance of the year, and not a throwaway like Crowe's performance in the mediocre Gladiator.  But, apparently, he was even too rude and boorish for Hollywood (which is saying something when major stars can still win Oscars after attacking people with golf clubs).Jennifer Connolly won an oscar for her role, but I'm not quite sure why.  Her performance is adequate, but the role is thin and her range of emotion is merely ordinary.  There is one scene where she is driven into a rage of frustration, shattering a mirror in the process, but that is the only shining moment for her.Now if we can only get Mr. Howard to get off the schmaltzy ending train ...",N/A

677019,"Moulin Rouge is theatre as it should be. It is a feast for the senses, an enthralling and captivating spectacle that entertains, exhilarates, and grips the emotions. This is more than a movie: It is an experience. On more than one occasion I almost wanted to rise to my feet and applaud. For this reviewer, at least, Moulin Rouge was an absolute riot.For those who think the musical genre could never work again, save in the context of a Disney cartoon: Think again. The movie-musical receives here a glorious resurrection. Musical numbers are pulled off with style, wit and imagination, and the tongue is never far from the inside cheek, meaning that we never feel we are watching a movie that belongs to an earlier time. Tunes are drawn from an entire century or more of music, often hilariously executed (if I tell you that Madonna's Like a Virgin is staged in the mode of a show-stopping, toe-tapping Broadway musical number, you will gain an idea of the general tenor of the picture). The film's terrifically old-fashioned conventions are given a modern lilt, and are met with a refreshing and creative energy at the hands of veteran director, Baz Luhrmann (Strictly Ballroom, Romeo and Juliet). Shades of Shakespeare are everywhere seen. Stylistically, we are in the surreal world of Jeunet and Caro (Delicatessen, Amelie). Musically, this is in a category of its own, quite unparalleled.Don't be fooled into thinking this is nothing more than a cracked attempt at a musical revue. That was exactly the impression I had from the trailers, and it was with suspicion and hesitation that I rented this movie, at the recommendation of a friend. I wasn't to be disappointed: I had tremendous fun watching Moulin Rouge, and hope you will too.",N/A
322857,"It's hard for me to believe that there is anyone out there who hasn't seen Coppola's 3 Godfather movies.  If there is such a person, he or she would be well advised to buy this set.  Don't believe what people say about the 3rd part being a stinker either.  It may not be quite as stellar as the first two films but it is a worthy conclusion to the film saga and is necessary to bring closure to the series.  A &quot;Who's Who&quot; of the acting world, this film trilogy uses just about anyone who became big in the 1970s as an actor plus big actors from other eras as well. There's Marlon Brando's return to the big time in the first film as the pater familias of a New York City mob family, the godfather himself.  However, even more identified with this film series is Al Pacino, who stars in all 3 films as the the godfather's son who is reluctant to enter the family business but then shows himself to have even more natural talent in it than his father did.  Robert DeNiro plays the Brando role in the 2nd film but is the &quot;young&quot; godfather starting out in New York.  He is superb.  Robert Duvall is the family lawyer in the first two films and his brash, overbearing style here is hard to imagine when juxtaposed with quieter, later roles of his, showing us the full range of his talent.  Diane Keaton as Michael's wife brings the thankless job of being a mob wife totally home. The late John Cazeles is wonderful as Michael's weak brother, Fredo.  And you see James Caan here in the role that he would play for the rest of his career, Sonny Corleone, the hot headed brother of Michael's, who doesn't have enough control over himself to take over his father's position. Artistically I think Coppola went even higher with his &quot;Apocalypse Now,&quot; &quot;One From the Heart&quot; and &quot;The Conversation&quot; but why split hairs? He's a formidable talent and most of his work, including this trilogy, shows that.",N/A
537020,"What PEARL HARBOR strives to be is the ""Titanic"" it never was. Sure, it's a blockbuster, but the movie is far from getting a Best Picture Oscar nomination, except probably for the special effects and sound effects.PEARL HARBOR is counting the days until and after the Day of Infamy, December 7, 1941, all the while spinning a somewhat uneven romantic triangle between Kate Beckinsale, Josh Harnett and Ben Affleck. Affleck and Harnett are top-notch pilots, while Beckinsale is an adorable nurse whom they both love.PEARL HARBOR is a uneven movie that tries to be the ""Titanic"" of 2001, and turns out to be a pale imitation. Sure, it's not good, but it's far from being a expensive piece of eye candy. What we get from the movie is countless cameos from Cuba Gooding Jr. and dozens more; an uneven romantic subplot with the most awful romantic dialogue there is; a frightening, realistic 30 minutes as the Japanese bomb Pearl Harbor; and a sad ending.I prefer TITANIC over PEARL HARBOR because the story focuses more on the characters and events surrounding them, whilst PEARL HARBOR unevenly paces the many subplots it's sagging with, no tension as the battle rages on and off the battlefield, and all of the characters aren't fully fleshed out.If you're looking for a good tear-jerker, this isn't your flick.

584936,"I saw Spider-Man last night at a sneak preview sponsored by a famous food company.  As a lifelong Spider-Man fan, I was very pleased with Sam Raimi's faithful interpretation of Stan Lee and Steve Ditko's character, and his world.  The writing couldn't have captured the spirit of the comic any better, and the casting was truly inspired.  Unlike so many other comic book movies, Spider-Man brought the best of the series to the screen without needless changes aimed at ""marketing"" to a broader audience.My only complaint with the film was the Green Goblin's costume.  Defoe is one of Hollywood's greatest modern faces, he can convey a broad range of emotions simply by changing the expression on his face. Yet in Spider-Man his face is covered with a metal shell which doesn't move at all.  Not even when he speaks.

A departure from the sleazy sets of Dr. No and Goldfinger. Nonetheless, I never expected myself, a die-hard Connery fan, to say that George Lazenby blows everyone away in the contest for the best Bond. He and Diana Rigg make the most stylish pair of all. She: coolly intelligent yet girlish and spoiled. He: brutish strength yet disarming boyishness. The Combination: Sexy and suspensful -- for REAL. When she teases and manipulates him, we can't tell which side she's on. When he kicks huge guys' a**es and outruns expert hitmen, we totally believe it. Not to mention, when he makes the girls squeal, we know he loves it! He delivers the lines with force AND humor, well suited to the context. Unlike Moore who just delivered it all with a smirk, or Connery who was so conflicted and serious. Lazenby also looks the best of them all in a kilt. Now, I KNOW Connery IS Scottish and I KNOW Diana and George hated each other during the filming, but that's just how it is. Wish he'd made another.

286065,"This 1941 film is the Hollywood life of George Armstrong Custer - the cadet with the lowest marks and the highest demerits in the history of West Point. He only excelled in horsemanship and swordsmanship. It begins with his arrival as a cadet from Michigan; his hero was Murat. In need of officers, he is sent to Washington. He meets General Winfield Scott and is sent to the front. Custer helps to prevent a defeat at Gettysburg by repulsing Stuart's cavalry.Back in civilian life he is offered the chance to lend his name to a business: to sell stock on his reputation, and gain a government monopoly. Custer rejects this deal. His wife meets General Scott and asks that he be placed on the active list. He is, and assigned to the Dakotas. He finds Fort Abraham Lincoln in disarray: slackness, a lack of training, drinking, and selling guns to the Indians. He imposed order on the 7th Cavalry. But his hot temper drew him into a trap. One scene explains the writing of ""Garry Owen"" and its adaption by the 7th Cavalry.The film shows the Great Plains Indians defended their homeland against the invaders. Defeated, they promise to keep the peace treaty as long as their sacred Black Hills were not invaded. But greedy gold seekers came, and the war was renewed. The railroad company and their politicians wanted to bring in new settlers, and profit from this. You can read about this in the history books.General Custer was given orders to pursue the Indians and do as he thought best. His regiment proceeded up the Rosebud towards the Little Big Horn river. The film shows them chasing a small group that draws them into a trap - the oldest trick in the book! Into the valley of death rode the three hundred; someone had blundered. On the 100th anniversary of the Declaration of Independence America learned of Custer's last stand. Custer found fame and glory from his defeat.

Joined by gutter-mouth announcer Joey Styles and aggravated World Heavyweight Champ Shane Douglas, you will see why this DVD beats anything you have seen from Vinnie Mac's company.1. Jerry Lynn vs. Justin Credible- If you ever saw these two men only on the WWF, you will be very surprised. Reverse slams, power bombs and lots of hurrincanranas abound as both men fight off in the supposed final chapter of their rivalry. Lynn does a hurrincanrana that sends Credible diving through a table outside the ring. But Credible fights back, and with the aid of his cronies, lands a piledriver on Lynn from the top rope to get this show cooking! ****1/22. Lance Storm vs. Chris Candido- Former friends collide in the weakest but also safest match of the night. Don't let that drop your confidence, because they still do some extreme work. A huge chop fest and a superplex out of the ring are this match's highlights. Whoops, how can I forget the moment with Tammy Lynn Stych and the powder, or Candido's huge power bomb off the top rope?! ****3. Masato Tanaka vs. Mike Awesome- DANGAN! This is the bestest best battle I've ever seen between these two titans. This can't be just a hardcore match; it's a strategic hardcore confrontation where aerial flight, steel chairs and a table all come into play at the hands of both these men. You'll scream ""Holy S."" when Awesome leaps over the ropes to land on Tanaka, and this senor's almost 300 pounds! But that's not all. Awesome lands 4 steel chair shots that almost breaks the seat of the chair onto Tanaka's head, and Tanaka still kicks out! However, you'll love Tanaka even more when he dashes 70 feet to cave in a chair on Awesome's head (""Mike Awesome went down like a giant redwood tree!""), throws Awesome OVER the rope through a table outside (THE BEST TABLE BUMP EVER), and lands a tornado DDT through two stacked chairs to get the win. This match especially had the crowd going wild at the end, and it shocked Styles and Douglas from head to toe. Check it out! *****+++4. Sabu and Rob Van Dam vs. Hayabusa and Jinsei Shinzaki- If you love airborne warfare, you got it when two wrestlers each from two different companies (ECW & FMW) square each other off for the ECW Tag Titles! Undoubtly, Hayabusa and Shinzaki fly off the rings and injure Sabu and Rob with plenty of strikes to the face and chests. But the extreme tag team rocket themselves with full power, trapping each of their opponents to nightmarish double teams and terrific head-busting chair shots. They also gain the final advantage as Hayabusa and Shinzaki are simultaneously drop-kicked through a single table by Sabu and the Whole Effin' Show! What a match, but it loses points only for two mistakes in the match (Missed chair catch and broken table leg). ****1/25. Taz vs. Bam Bam Bigelow- This is a wild, fast-paced brawl with the goliath Beast From the East trying to tear apart Taz before the suplexing machine can have a title shot against none other than Douglas himself! Spills outside of the ring, but once the match gets back inside, BBB then smashes Taz through a table. Taz fights back, and gives Bigelow his own medicine, suplexing the giant onto that same table! Back out of the ring, Taz tornado DDTs BBB through the ramp floor, causing both to fall inside! (""They killed each other!"") But just as it seems only Bigelow had the strength to get back up from the fall, out pops Taz as he finishes off Bigelow with a Taz-mission, and forces Douglas to accept that his days as a champ are about to be numbered! ****1/26. Dudleyz vs. Tommy Dreamer, Sandman, and Spike Dudley- The final match has got nothing on technical skill, but this brawl will have you laughing at the insanity of it all. Several chairs, a ladder (they could've used all three), and a table all are demolished in this insane feud for vengeance for Beulah's (Dreamer's girlfriend) injury! The story is one worth telling, as the Dudleyz obnoxious buddies, including fatty boy Joel Gertner, taste the wrath of the odd trio from chair shots to piledrivers! The match ends rather abruptly with a ddt on Bubba-Ray Dudley by Tommy Dreamer through a ladder, but just as it seems to be done, in comes Jack Victory to help out the Dudleyz. But wait! Out comes New Jack to deliver some comeuppance to Victory and the Dudleyz! New Jack throws a few garbage weapons for Dreamer, Sandman and Spike to fulfill the revenge and get those losers out of there. Oh, and did I forget to mention that Jack Victory gets planted on the head by a brutal guitar shot?!Tommy Dreamer was perfectly right at the end, when he said, ""It's safe to say...that Dayton, Ohio...is EXTREME COUNTRY!""****So if you love hardcore battles, if you enjoy table spots in almost every match, and if you think ECW was not the greatest company in U.S. wrestling, grab this dvd now and see what you've been missing.

357595,"Sam Peckinpah (""The Getaway"") delivers his usual blend of action and paranoia in this 1983 sleeper, which stars the underrated Rutger Hauer as a investigative TV reporter out of the Mike Wallace mold, and John Hurt as the CIA operative.  Burt Lancaster as the national security chief reprises his role as an overzealous cold warrior type (like he played in ""Seven Days in May"").  The plot takes off when Lancaster, the frequent target of Hauer's hit pieces for his civil liberties violations, turns Hauer over to Hurt, who reveals that Hauer's business partners (Craig Nelson, cast against his ""Coach"" type as a ruthless businessman, and the ever-edgy Dennis Hopper) are traitorous subversives selling government secrets to the communists.Soon the plot takes several twists and turns and everyone is mice trapped in a maze with the cat having just been dropped in.  ""The Osterman Weekend"" starts off as a traditional espionage thriller as a red herring just to fool you, but becomes a paranoid psychological manhunt which will leave you wondering who is the good guy and who is the bad guy (which I won't give away here).The acting is top notch, especially Hauer;  It is such a shame seeing an actor with such a fine sense of timing and the ability to impart dialogue with intelligence, wit and subtle power, being trapped in made-for-cable and miniseries supporting roles.  ""The Osterman Weekend"" shows off the full power of his dramatic acumen , and is up there with his performances in ""Fatherland,"" ""The Hitcher"" and ""Inside the Third Reich.""  Lancaster and Hurt are chilling as the tough-guy spook and the manipulative psychological warfare agent, respectively.  I still say that *no one* can deliver an impassioned speech better than Lancaster, and he's in top form here.So, treat yourself to a great psychological thriller that's almost as great as ""The Manchurian Candidate,"" with the devastating action and shoot-em-up pyrotechnics you expect from Sam Peckinpah.

The disc offers quite a lot of information and footage:  the documentary itself covers the Carpenters from their beginnings as a jazz trio to the A&M; hits to Karen's tragic death at the age of 32.  The disc has lots of extras too:  A portion of the Carpenters performance at the White House, some of their commercials, and a listing of singles and albums in the discography section.

The DVD tells briefly about Karen's wedding, but doesn't even mention who she married!!!  What was it that made Karen such a tragic figure?  What is Richard doing now and how did the end of the Carpenters change his life?  Maybe I'm asking for too much and maybe all this is still too painful for the family to deal with.  I don't think fans are asking for tabloid-type reporting.  I do think a lot of fans sincerely want to know what was going through Karen's mind, what demons she was dealing with and what Richard is dealing with now.  Maybe that's too much for them to present to the general public.

661866,"I've been wanting to get this movie since reading a rather breathless review on Planet Out a couple of years ago.It's a better movie than I expected, but you should know it's not a gay love story.  Our hero, Pol, played by Alan Paule, is determinedly hetero but turns to hustling to raise money for his impoverished family.  To this end, he goes to Manila and becomes a male (macho) dancer in a sex club.  You may make of that what you will, the film, is non-judgmental.  Pol maintains a certain detachment from his chosen craft; the cover art for the CD is taken from the one scene in which he genuinely seems to enjoy being erotic with another guy and Pol's lovemaking scene with Bambi, a cute, sassy young female Philippino in the same situation, is the hottest scene in the movie.There's only one character in the film who appears to have homo-erotic tendencies, Noel, played by Daniel Fernando, and he ends up tragically.  His was the more interesting and attractive character to me.  There's only one gay kiss that isn't just for the sake of the show at the sex club and Pol is genuinely surprised that Noel would kiss him on the lips other than when they're on stage.There is a lot of simulated eroticism and near total male nudity, even a little total male nudity (one brief scene in which a bunch of the dancers are on stage masturbating - shot from across the room, not close up) and a lot of simulated sex acts.  Pol is pretty good at undulating and gyrating in a g-string; Noel is even better.Maybe as much as a third of the movie consists of these scenes of male dancers, serving as backdrop for a morality tale involving Pol and Noel and Noel's sister in which the heavy is the police official who ""protects"" this aspect of Philippino society.  To the extent the film is a commentary on social conditions which give rise to all of this prostitution, it paints a much direr picture of the young Philippino girls who are drawn into this trade than of the young men.  I've read the film is a searing indictment of the corruption that existed under the Marcos and Aquino regimes.  I lack the knowledge of Philippino society to judge this statement, but ""The Comedians"" with Richard Burton and Elizabeth Taylor was a searing indictment of life in Haiti under Papa Doc and this film has nowhere near the power of that one.So much of the film is devoted to the scenes at the sex clubs it's difficult to believe the filmmaker was simply producing an indictment of political corruption but I'm not sure what else to make of it.The acting is better than I expected, as is the filmmaking, but this DVD was produced from a very old and scratchy copy of the film and is the worst visually I've ever seen.Planet Out is incapable of giving anything less than a breathless review to any film in which at least one malecharacter takes his shirt off but I give this film only 3 stars.",N/A

The cast acquits itself honorably, and the movie is very entertaining, yet it lacks either the pervasive foreboding of ""The Silence of the Lambs"" or the stylishness of ""Manhunter,"" Michael Mann's original film version of Thomas Harris' novel of ""Red Dragon."" Brett Ratner is a good journeyman director; he paces the movie well, and gets a good share of thrills from the terrifying story. But he lacks the distinctive style of either Mann or Jonathan Demme. Compare how Ratner and Mann stage the ultimate fate of the sleazy tabloid reporter played by Stephen Lang in ""Manhunter"" and by Hoffman in ""Red Dragon."" The basic situation is horrific beyond belief, but Ratner's staging is pedestrian compared with Mann's, which rolls down the garage ramp into our nightmares. Among the ""Red Dragon"" cast, Fiennes and Watson make the most of their satisfyingly showy roles, but once again it is Hopkins, with his dead-fish stare and malevolent grin, who is the truly unforgettable and indispensable member of the cast.",N/A

507685,"Takeshi ""Beat"" Kitano has gained notoriety and acclaim in Japan as well as a large fanbase in the States, mainly due to his unique genre of films and his uncompromising vision and style.Kitano does a great job in all of his films in protraying the brutal and violent world of the Yakuza, usually playing a character that seems cold at first but eventually having some amount of humanity in him. A common theme I have noticed in many Kitano films is the ""unhappy ending"". No peaches and cream here folks.The title Violent Cop sums it up pretty nicely. Kitano plays Azuma, a cop who goes beyond the line that cops cannot cross legally. The movie is much deeper than the title suggests, however, because there are underlying themes of humanity, honor, and consequence. Tarantino has nothing on Takeshi, and after watching Violent Cop you can see why. Not many can pull off cold and brutal as well as Kitano can, and his characters are always intriguing.This film isn't Kitano's best, but it's up there with ""Fireworks"" and ""Sonatine"".

519718,"I am really not quite sure what to say or how to start it. I have never been interested in this legendary story, and this movie hasn't converted me. It is very easy to look at, but it's hard to to follow and hard to keep your attention to it. Director Peter Jackson has, without a doubt, delivered a magnificent looking film. He has created an unbelieveable world thanks to J.R.R. Tolkien, and brought to life some pretty good characters. Still, it wasn't enough for me. Everything about this film is marvelously done and made and acted, but I wasn't swept up by it. Here's the story - A magical ring falls into the hands of a young hobbit named Frodo Baggins(Elijah Wood), who sets out on a journey to Mordor, to destroy the ring. He is aided and guided by a magical wizard named Gandolf(Superbly done by Sir Ian McKellen). He is also supported by three other hobbit friends, led by Sam(Sean Astin). Along the way they meet up with Aragorn(Viggo Mortensen), an elf(Liv Tyler), and assorted other characters(Played by John Rhys Davies, Orlando Bloom, and Sean Bean from ""Goldeneye""). Also on hand is horror and film legend Christopher Lee, who gives a fantastic performance that will no doubt make his legion of fans smile proudly. The old master still has it. The storytelling is rich and deep, without question, but I could just never get involved with it. The landscape and cinematography is wonderful and, at times, extremely beautiful. The movie might of floundered if it were held together by a lesser cast. That's the best thing this film has going for it. The cast. Sir Ian is the very best of the bunch. You watch every single frame he's in. Listen to every word he utters. It's hard to say that about the others, but they are all still good. Clocking in at a near 3 hours, the film runs pretty long and certainly drags in a few places, but it usually picks up with some kind of heart pounding scene that grabs your attention. The loyalists and fans will no doubt be pleased and satisfied, but newbies to the story might not be as swept away by the film itself. The effects and all that, sure, but I doubt they will be as excited for the next chapter as the fans. As for the upcoming sequel, I'll wait for cable.

408249,"Up there with Bunuel's work as an analysis of elitism and also up there with &quot;Cannibal! The Musical!&quot; as the strangest (and funniest) musical ever made, this is a treat.Its length can seem intimidating, but it goes by quickly.  The opening half has a lot of the feel and wit of Victorian drawing room comedies, only infinitely more scandalous and blasphemous.  After the 13th Earl of Guerney buys the farm in rather spectacular fashion, it goes to his son, Jack.  Only Jack would prefer Joshua; you see, he thinks he's Jesus Christ.  This naturally scandalizes his uncle, who of course is out for the family money.To blow what follows wouldn't be fair, because you won't see it coming.  Suffice to say this goes from being light, witty comedy to something much more serious; the line I quoted above closes out the film and it's one of the more chilling things you'll hear.This is highly recommended.

535215,"I watched this movie in the summer, but from that one viewing, I couldn't really review it. So I waited, and I got it again last night and watched it twice.A second viewing is required to fully enjoy this movie. A first viewing, and you will say, ""Pretty good!"". A second viewing and you will say, ""This is so awesome!""-and every other word that is a synonym to awesome.Slick, stylish, funny-everything you could want in this type of movie. Intermixing storylines give this movie a nice touch, especially when a person from one of the storylines does something that impacts the other storyline without even knowing it.Each character in this movie contributes to the overall effect. By themselves, the characters may be boring. Together, each and every character compliments the other characters, meaning that they all suddenly become a whole lot funnier and more interesting.The reason I needed the second viewing was also because I couldn't understand half of what was being said the first time I watched it. The second time, everything became clear, and suddenly, I understood the whole plot. The third time I watched it, I could understand 5/6 of what Mickey was saying. (and that is an accomplishment in itself) Even if you don't understand the characters (and as you see, half the characters in the movie itself can't understand Mickey either) it is still an enjoyable film. The best parts in this are definitely the ones where the storylines touch each other. Example-the three cars scene, the hallway scene, and even the dogs and a hare scene.Tyrone and his ""funny angle"" part held a special laugh for my cousin, who backed into a Jaguar one day, and said almost the exact same thing.Great acting from every single actor/actress here. This is the third film that I've watched with del Toro in it, and he hasn't disappointed me yet. (the others were Traffic and The Usual Suspects) Brad Pitt did a worthy job as the ""piker""/gypsy and Statham was great as Turkish.The best-character-in-the-movie award has to go to...the dog (or the ""dag""). I LOVED the dog-he has the best part in the movie. I won't reveal anything, but let's just say that the name of this movie is most likely derived from this dog.Also has a killer ending, and a great climax with the boxing match. You don't even really have to see the first movie (yes, this is a sequel) to understand this one-I certainly haven't watched the first yet (called Lock, Stock, and Two Smoking Barrels) but I understood everything in the movie.

221815,"""Chinatown"" arguably represents Jack Nicholson at his very best in his most enduring role, despite not having received an Oscar for his effort.  Fortunately Robert Towne netted an Oscar for Best Original Screenplay in what film experts consider one of the greatest scenarios ever written.  Screenwriting guru Syd Field has used the Towne script as a working model for a generation as a teaching guide.The muted photography of cinematographer John A. Alonzo along with the neatly selected settings reveal Los Angeles in 1937.  Jack Gittes is a Los Angeles detective initially used as a fall guy in a battle for water rights.  The longer Nicholson as Gittes investigates, the more convinced he becomes that the man behind the skullduggery, which ultimately results in the murder of Horace Mulwray, the honest head of the Department of Water and Power who does not want to build a new dam and risk a tragedy such as the earlier described Van Lipp disaster, is super wealthy Noah Cross, played by John Huston.Gittes is a man used to dealing with criminal minds less powerful and less ruthless than Cross.  As Robert Towne noted in an interview about the film, a major element of ""Chinatown"" is the shocking realization on the part of Nicholson, who had formerly worked as a police officer assigned to Chinatown, that John Huston as Noah Cross is a man who will do anything to get what he wants, and is more ruthless than anyone he ever encountered.  When an exasperated Gittes asks Cross at one point what he can possibly gain through a big land payoff predicated on accessibility to water, noting that he could buy anything he wanted presently, Cross answers, ""The future, Mr. Gittes, the future.""Towne shrewdly used a historical controversy from Los Angeles history, the career of William Mulholland and the tragedy of the Van Norman Dam.  History was juxtaposed and the controversy was moved from the first decade of the twentieth century to 1937.  It made good sense cinematically since the city was so much more developed by that time.Another integral element of the film is Nicholson's developing romantic relationship with Faye Dunaway as Evelyn Mulwray, widow of the slain water chief and daughter of Noah Cross.  Gittes'  romantic progress is slowed by the manner in which he holds Evelyn, an erudite, sophisticated woman in awe, someone removed from his own rough and tumble middle class world.  He ultimately learns that the daughter toward whom Evelyn is so protective was sired by none other than Noah Cross.In addition to adroitly directing the film, maintaining a consistently brisk pace, Roman Polanski also had a small but key acting role.  Playing one of Cross' thugs, he tells Gittes, ""You've got a big nose, kitty cat.""  To prove his point, while another Cross hoodlum, a crooked ex-sheriff, holds Gittes, Polanski snips off part of the detective's nose with a knife.",N/A
406536,"&quot;Stealing Beauty&quot; could be considered a breakthrough for both Liv Tyler and Rachel Weisz. Not only it helped Tyler shake off her failure in previous films (&quot;Heavy&quot; and &quot;Silent Fall&quot;), it gave her and Weisz a good leverage to box office hits thereafter (like &quot;The Mummy&quot; and &quot;Lord of the Rings&quot;). So Bernardo Bertolucci deserved all the credit here. In fact, the cast and cinematography were quite enjoyable. However, when it came to  Bertolucci's portrayal of life through the eyes of artists (and people connected with them in one way or another), I couldn't help thinking of Federico Fellini. I believe Bertolucci is almost as good as Fellini, just one small step short.

594115,Considering how much I really despise Beyonces group Destinys Child I kept my expectations for this movie relatively low. I was so sick and tired of hearing that strongly annoying voice on the radio and people shoving that DC krap in my face.However my expectations were completely blown away and Goldmember turned out to be my favorite of the Austin Powers saga.The jokes that dominated the first two flicks are continued in the third installment of the bunch. Austin Powers is one a mission to stop a crazed man from using a magnetic beam to cause an giant asteroid to collide with earth. Plus Austin has to rescue his long lost father by the name of Nigel Powers.My favorite part was where Austin Powers met Britney Spears in the awful Boyz video when it turns out that the Britney in the movie was actually a fembot. I literally laughed when I saw the fembot blow up.While the female charachter Foxy Cleopatra did get on my nerves at the beginning I must say she turned out much better than I thought.

Maybe there's some truth on the werewolf legends after all.....This is a typical ""a group of people gather in a strange place and get killed one after the other while they try to figure out what's happening""-movie, and like many movies of its kind, it suffers from lack of any real plot, and has too many characters that you never really get to know. Especially in the beginning there are a number of scenes with lots of unimportant dialogue. The acting is like in most b-grade horror movies not very good.This movie is better than ""Howling III"", but not good as ""The Howling"" or ""Howling IV"" and not as funny as ""Howling II"". It's just another b-horror movie with nothing that will make you remember it. But if you've watched the four previous Howling-movies you might just as well watch this one as well.",N/A
48101,"Unlike ""The Right Stuff,"" the brilliant film on the Mercury space program that focuses more on character profiles and symbolism than factual history, ""Apollo 13"" is an entertaining space film that can be used by high school and junior high history teachers. This is due to director Ron Howard and his crew's painstaking recreation of the Apollo space program -- from using a weightless environment to borrowing large chunks of mission control transcripts. The recreations are so dead-on that astronauts and mission control members report having forgotten they were on a set, or confusing the digital imitations for the real thing.Where Howard's dazzling special effects and technical accuracy leave off, his cast takes over. Tom Hanks' enthusiasm for the subject matter shows as Commander Jim Lovell. He skillfully portrays both the excitement of going into space and the stoicism with which the astronauts approached their dangerous work. Bill Paxton as Lunar Module Pilot Fred Haise, Kevin Bacon as Command Module Pilot Jack Swigert and Kathleen Quinlan as Lovell's wife Marilyn also shine, but it is masters of subtlety Ed Harris as flight director Gene Kranz and Gary Sinise as grounded astronaut Ken Mattingly who steal every scene. They are given ample opportunity to do so, thanks to the wise decision to focus as much on the heroism on the ground from geeks with pocket protectors as the heroism in space from the astronauts.The only problem is the film's occasional ham-handedness, most noticably in its attempts to place the mission in a historical context. Where Hanks, Howard and producer Brian Grazer's miniseries ""From the Earth to the Moon"" (in the segment ""1968"") deftly underscored the turbulence of the late 1960s and early 1970s, this film makes offhand references through the eldest Lovell daughter to the Hippie Movement and the Beatles breaking up, which comes off as crass and afterthought-like.Still, the film is alternately suspenseful and meticulous in most of the right places, and is therefore valuable both as a movie and as a historical record.The DVD was made when studios were only beginning to play with the medium, and while the ""Apollo 13"" DVD was an early groundbreaker, the awkwardness shows. An hour-long documentary and two commentary tracks -- one from Howard, one from the real-life Jim and Marilyn Lovell -- together provide a glimpse into both the historical facts and the filmmaking tricks (although screenwriters William Broyles, Jr. and Al Reinert are entirely ignored). But the extras mostly stop there. There is a trailer and production and cast and crew notes, and the menu is a CD for the film score soundtrack, albeit a CD which cannot be paused and in which you can skip FORWARD but not BACKWARDS. Yet the DVD is a far cry from the Special Editions of today. There are no NASA documentaries, for instance, and very little original documentary footage.While it seems possible, perhaps likely, that Universal could eventually release an even more loaded DVD release, the current one is more than adequate for educational and entertainment purposes.",N/A

ADV has also put together an impressive package here, featuring 3 DVD's for less than the price of two of the VHS editions, removeable subtitles, chapter selections, and some of the most creative and effective cover art ever brought to a Japanese SciFi film release.

475860,"Already over 2,000 reviews on this thing so far.  That's amazing, but even more amazing was how uninspiring this film was.  The city planet was a strange place, and it reminded of all the trips to Boston on Rte 128 or Rte 495.  I can't imagine a planet that reminds me of New York City.  That was a truly disturbing vision.  Then there were the Jedi's.  Not too inspiring, either.  The villains were preposterous, as was the alleged UN of the planets.  Just the same kind of stuff as in the year 2002.  Boring, boring, and politically boring.  Ja-Ja Binks was the real winner, here, and I'm not getting into the racist dialogue.  He had nothing to do with being a Jamaican, no matter what anyone says.  He was a unique character, and his city under the sea was truly inspiring.  The rest of the movie was a set-up for the next.

Secondly, this profound and powerful film brings tears to my eyes even now, weeks later.  I've heard people link it to To Kill a Mockingbird and Forrest Gump, but I don't believe it needs to ride the coattails of anything--it's strong on its own.  This movie is ultimately about sacrifice, but it holds its own on all kinds of subjects, ranging from the treatment of criminally insane to domestic violence to child abuse.  John Ritter beautifully brings to life a warm, loving, stable gay character, and that, in my book, only adds to the film's far-reaching appeal.  The surprise performance:  Dwight Yoakam's portrayal of the drunken, abusive Doyle.  This film is perfection.",N/A
520206,"Every dime they've spent on this trilogy is on the screen. Whether it's set design, costumes, make-up or digital wizardry - even the acting - they've gotten the biggest possible bang for every buck. The movie is a continuous visual feast from beginning to end. It's just that by the time the last course comes out, you've been sitting back from the table with your hands folded across your chest for almost an hour. And, since the final installment won't be out until Christmas 2003, you know there won't be a dessert.The creators' devotion to the events in the source material is admirable but also a limitation. Tolkien often substituted internal back-story and characterization for plot development and this is glaringly evident on film. The plot breaks down into a three hour chase sequence that feels uncomfortably repetitive.If you don't know where the first book ends, you'll be treated to a least a half dozen false endings that utilize every visual and musical cue to indicate the credits are about to roll...then cut to more dialogue. Every third person in the theater looked at their watch when this happened. I didn't realize so many folks had day-glow watches these days.I am not saying the movie is a waste of time. The elements that make the Rings trilogy great - Tolkien's imagination and love of detail and his depiction of the individual's potential for good and evil - are evident. But there have been so many movies inspired by his work that - unfortunately - it takes the luster off the master's story when it finally sees its moment in the sun.",The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring
727118,"Reese Witherspoon shines, surrounded by strong supporting characters like Mary Kay Place (of the TV series, Mary Hartman, Mary Hartman, popular some 20 years ago), and a shrewd, witchy Candice Bergen. ""Sweet Home Alabama"" is made according to the old-fashioned formula of romance, dilemma, and symmetry. The film begins and ends at the same place, the beach on the Gulf Coast in a severe electrical storm.My sole criticism is that some of the outfits that Witherspoon wears in the film belie her successful career as a New York fashion designer.Her two love interests, her Alabama high school sweetheart who stocks his refrigerator with non-lite Bud, and her New York fiance who stages his marriage proposal in an after-hours opening of Tiffany's jewelry department, could not be further apart, geographically and otherwise.This good-natured film will evoke nostalgia for the well-made stories of the 1940s.

317055,"This is a great Bond movie.  You could tell it was written for Connery, right before his departure from the series.  It's very suspenseful, and has a great premise, and a great villain in Christopher Lee.  However, about an hour an a half into the movie, there's one glaring fault that always bothers me: as Bond jumps his car over a river in an amazing stunt during a chase sequence, the filmmakers added the sound effect of a child's whislte; the whistle is the first note in the dumbing-down of Bond we suffered in the 70s.  It announces to us the series is about to get very silly.  Had Connery been in this one, it would have been one of the best of the entire series.",N/A
462889,"'Insomnia' announces itself as yet another 'Se7en' clone, with its brutal opening murder, as lovingly detailed and dehumanised in its execution as Kevin Spacey's handcraft at the beginning of Fincher's film; and in its nervy, scratchy credits sequence.  But, while it only became apparent near the end that 'Se7en' was really about the detectives rather than the killer, this film is a relentless study of a morally void cop.  In his first scene, we see Jonas scribbling over the victim's face; and a blunder in the early stages of the investigation finds him covering up the truth about the murder, rather than trying to reveal it, leading to an unholy pact with the killer.This perversion of the detective's traditional role is visualised in two related ways.  Firstly, the enlightenment the detective should bring, but here suppresses, is displaced onto the 24-hour bleaching sunlight of the Northern Norwegian coastal town in which the film is set.  A Swede in a hostile environment, and already guilty of abusing his position with sexual misdemeanours, Jonas tries to block out this light which prevents him from sleeping.  Lack of sleep begins to effect not only his morality, but his judgement - he gropes a teenage witness; he spies on her making love to the young sap he is going to frame; he nearly rapes the hotel receptionist he lusts after.  The film's rhythms and visuals take on the character of this psychological breakdown - the pace decelerates, becomes bleary and dream-like; the narrative fragments, heightened by the hallucinatory and visionary; the clinical white that seeps the frame blocks out all depth and perspective, leaving everything flat and on the surface.  Allied to this sun, which is too bright to shed any light, is the dusky, enveloping fog, wastes of garbage and delapidated buildings with their subterranean passages destroying any chance of truth and resolution emerging.It is a tribute to Stellan Skarsgard's brave, controlled performance as a nasty, gutless, uncontrolled psychotic, that it is at all possible to watch this unpleasant but compelling film to the end.",N/A

500302,"First let me say that Stanley Kubrick is one of my favorite filmmakers. Only Hitchcock, Welles, David Fincher and a few others can compare with him. But that doesn't mean that every movie he made was great (anyone see Eyes Wide Shut?). Barry Lyndon is not a great movie. It's a period piece, and it seems well researched. The costumes are great. The sets are magnificant. And the photography is beautiful. I heard somewhere that it was like watching a painting move. And that is pretty accurate. Kubrick paid very close attention to detail, and it is a very beautiful picture to watch. The problem is that the characters are one dimensional, Lord Bullingdon being the one exception. The acting is wooden. The story moves at such a slow pace. The movie feels like it goes on for hours and hours. It's hard to believe that the same guy who made A Clockwork Orange and Full Metal Jacket is the same filmmaker who made this movie. It's just plain boring. If you are a serious film student or a hard core fan of Kubrick, I'd say watch it once, just so you can say you did. Otherwise, rewatch A Clockwork Orange.",Barry Lyndon VHS

I bought this DVD because Hugh Jackman is utterly charming, charismatic and WOW is he easy on the eyes. I could watch this man read the phone book and it would probably be more entertaining and original than this movie's storyline. Meg Ryan who usually can act, decided not too for this movie. I wish that somebody would have informed Ms. Ryan that her hair looked like it was styled a la weedwacker in this movie(it was very distracting)! Don't get me wrong I usually love Meg in romantic comedies and I love Hugh in anything. The whole cast are good actors, but the script was just average, no new twists or surprises added to make this movie different from any other romantic comedy. How the time travel took place was different but highly questionable, like after jumping off the bridge how do they land in the other time era, on their feet with no impact or in the river, How does Stuart know that when Leopold goes back that he will be repeating the whole day over of when he left, and when Meg's character goes back why does she arrive later that day and just in time? I know that it is just a romantic comedy but....don't introduce and then not explain it.Oh, well. If you want to watch an extremely handsome man then this is the movie.

190254,"Okay, it's another homobittersweetsexual movie.  This one is set in a garish place called Hollywood, if you choose to believe a place populated by such shallow people really exists.  It's also a delightful trifle.Had I written this review shortly after receiving the DVD I would have gone on gushily about how great it is, but it hasn't worn that well with repeated viewings.  The slender thread - should I say tease - upon which the plot hangs, ""is he or isn't he,"" ""will he or won't he,"" hasn't sustained my interest that much on subsequent viewings.Still, it's a fun movie.Sean Hayes is wonderful in this endearing role he created before becoming a stereotypical queen on ""Will and Grace.""  The other characters are not as well drawn and mostly too true to simplistic stereotypes but are entertaining.  Brad Rowe plays the somewhat naive but just-a-little-bit curious hunk well.  It isn't a role that I'm very sympathetic to.  I realize he was supposed to be more wooden and less graceful than Billy, and a bit of a tease and a bit of a jerk, but I kept wondering if he was chosen just for his Brad Pitt looks.I am not a fan of drag or musicals, but the fantasy sequences were a real hoot, particularly the dance number with Billy and Gabriel and the Petula Clark numbers.  Besides Hayes acting, these are the best parts of the film.Director Tommy O'Haver has a few cute cinematic tricks up his sleeve.  The use of the Polaroid as integral to the story was fine, but he was overly fond of it's use as a cinematic device.  I found the opening sequence and ""groovy"" credits tedious the first time thru and even more so on subsequent viewings.  When a film starts out by playing down to the audience and talking down to the audience, it's usually not a good sign, but fortunately the rest of the film treats the audience more intelligently.The Polaroid device is also unfortunately used to present the tedious flashback of Billy's coming out, which I suppose is actually somewhat autobiographical of the director.  I suppose everybody thinks their coming out story is absolutely fascinating, but in truth they seldom are to anybody other than the teller.  Anyway, its preferable in a movie to show a prior coming out experience, if it's essential to the story, rather than just have a character narrate a slide show.  Billy's character is already the only well developed character in the film and this extra insight isn't necessary to the plot.Besides the tiresome overuse of the Polaroid as a cinematic device, the scene in which Billy gets some quality PosturePedic time with Gabriel and starts acting like a rabbit in a lettuce patch was a bit heavy for a trifle like this.  I was grateful Gabriel quickly put a stop to it.One of the best parts of the DVD is the track of director's comments; don't miss it.  There is a lot to the film that doesn't catch the eye of a casual viewer and I hope Mr. O'Haver has the opportunity to make more films, so long as he loses the Polaroid next time around.",N/A
532787,"Some critics have complained that the storyline in Vertical Limit is silly. I think they miss the point. This is a thriller, pure and simple, and on that level it is excellent. I think it must be quite difficult to make a movie that both pumps up the audience's adrenaline and tells a meaningful story that makes perfect sense. A few years ago I decided that this kind of picture succeeded if the action didn't totally defy logic, if the excitement was sustained and, if the plot was easy to follow. Vertical Limit easily meets these requirements. So what if the story is banal and absurd? So was Twister's. Such films serve the same purpose as thrill rides, and that purpose has nothing to do with education or enlightenment.The movie opens with a terrifying sequence. Peter [Chris O'Donnell] and his sister, Annie [Robin Tunney], are rock climbing with their Dad. Suddenly, some novice climbers above them fall. In the ensuing melee, the father is killed. Annie blames Peter. Four years later, the siblings are still cool towards each other. Peter has given up climbing and become a nature photographer, but Annie has become a professional mountaineer. Peter runs into her in Pakistan where Annie is working for Elliot Vaughn [Bill Paxton], a billionaire who is obsessed with climbing K-2, the highest mountain in the world. The expedition turns into a disaster when an avalanche sweeps Elliot, Annie and another climber into a cave, where they are trapped. Peter assembles a rescue team, which must endure wind, cold, icy precipices and more avalanches. They take along some nitroglycerine, which proves to be unstable and adds even more danger. If they don't hurry, the stranded trio will die, partly because the oxygen is very thin at 26,000 feet.Admittedly, the plot itself gets very thin at times. For example, why would they take nitroglycerin into an area where avalanches are your worst nightmare? Because this is an action-adventure movie, and such fare demands explosions. To me, the plot holes are inconsequential. Like Jaws, Twister, Independence Day and Armageddon, the story is just on outline to build the action on.It occurred to me while watching Vertical Limit that a viewer's involvement in a thriller increases when the subject matter involves things he or she is fearful of. There are three elements in the movie I find the thought of dreadful. Often when I am out in the cold, I wonder what would happen if I couldn't find a warm place. In certain situations, I think there is not enough air to breath. I don't have a fear of heights, but, oddly, I do have a great fear of falling. Vertical Limit takes place in zero degree weather on an icy, slippery mountain, so naturally I found it to be both frightening and fascinating. As thrillers went in the year 2000, this flick was at the top of the heap. Or the mountain.",N/A

I guess I feel that if the movie doesn't have to make sense, its review doesn't either. ;)This movie is a black hole of hopelessness. Everything is so drawn out and there seems to be no real point to anything...which is the way life seems at times. No solid plot, unexplained characters and events(?), dirty, dingy surroundings..I would say that Gummo is an important film because it answers no questions but raises many... Are there really people who live this way? Has anyone ever escaped this town/fate? Do I ever come across that way? Is it ok to be like that? What do I think about people like this, and does that make me a bad person? In other words, it forces you to examine yourself and the way you view others.Also, on the grander side, it asks what qualifies as a legitimate film? When does a movie become something other than art?Gummo is definately more than art, because it captures very difficult sensations from real life and unapologetically subjects the viewer to them.In conclusion, I would not recommend this movie to those who have a problem with unflinching ugliness, disorienting situations, and sincere self-examination.",N/A

(Storyline?)Movie traces the lives of Frida Kahlo and Diego Rivera from the time the schoolgirl and friends first ogle him and his model when he comes to town, to their marriage, their divorce, their re-marriage and...it's frankly hard to tell what happens at the end, but I assumed Sra. Kahlo was near death.Be warned, there is a lot of sex and nudity. There is also a lot of blood, and a particularly graphic scene involving an embryo. Those familiar with the career of Kahlo will not be surprised at this. Those unfamiliar may wince at all of this.On the plus side, there are some really cool visual effects involving some puppetry and other low-tech graphics, as you might expect from The Lion King's Julie Taymor. Pay close attention to the paintings in the movie.All in all, I personally found a visually beautiful movie which dangerously smelled of lacking a plot. Point-of-view changes constantly from narration to observation. If the unsuspecting moviegoers keep the kids at home, turn their heads during the grosser parts, and do not expect a strict biopic, I think they may find it, at the very least, interesting. It's not a feel-good movie by any stretch, but it's not totally pessimistic, either. In fact, I found myself not knowing what exactly to feel by the end of it.",Frida

Actually, this movie breaks new ground on a number of fronts, one of which is to involve the cameraperson in the movie.  And so if the camera is off center or sideways or shaking or even dropped, you can tell how the cameraperson is feeling and since this is a horror movie, the point is to show how very very scared everyone is, especially the person who is holding the camera.Another effective aspect of the movie besides the way it was shot is the way it was cast.  The characters/victims are not professional actors/actresses giving canned responses.  They are again amateurs, and the way in which they talk and act in the movie is very realistic.  The audience can identify with them.Finally, the situation that arises in this movie, that of losing the map and getting lost in the woods, is a situation which almost anyone can relate to.  Even if you haven't actually gotten lost before, the fear or the momentary nudge that maybe you don't know where you're going, or that you can't trust the person who is leading the way or who is entrusted with the map is certainly a psychological dynamic which we are no doubt familiar with.And then there are those sounds and shadows in the middle of the night in the woods when you are camping out, which you can't quite identify but which look or sound eerily reminscent of something which you have seen or heard before . . . .",Curse of the Blair Witch VHS

The movie takes off like a rocket and the action doesn't stop 'til the end - and that's when you suddenly realize the ride is almost over and you start wishing for more.

86389,"Let's get one thing straight, the Kubrick film is not, repeat, is not the book. It is a re-invention of the theme under the same title. That being said, let's cut the whining about how different it is from the book and try to judge the film on its own merits.The movie held my attention from start to finish, and geuniunely scared me at parts. Much has been made of the characters, so let's review them. First, there is Jack, a man who was apparently never very stable and, once placed in relative isolation in a haunted hotel, goes completely crazy. This is consistent with the character's history as explained in the film. His &quot;recovery&quot; after breaking his son's arm was apparently only a thin shell that he developed to hide his abberation. As a side note, this is consistent with the Jack in the book, who never sought outside help to help him control his drinking (unlike the miniseries, the first 20 minutes or so of which seemed like Jack doing a commercial for AA). In this film (and in the book) Jack's erratic nature was invisible to his family because they loved him blindly. Shelly Duval's character appears to be just the kind of person who could love a person so blindly, so she gets five stars too.Danny's performance in the movie is also widely criticized as over the top, especially with regards to the &quot;redrum&quot; sequence. Let's not forget, however, that he is a child and something unworldly is happening to him. What do you expect, calm acceptance of his situation? I doubt that even an adult could manage that in his situation. Furthermore, the Tony in the film was largely unseen, like the Tony in the book, which enhanced the effect of &quot;his&quot; role greatly. This is in contrast to the Tony of the miniseries, who hovered above Danny and preached like some cheesy b-movie angel.A lot is made about the elements of the book that were excluded. The things that were lost, however, really made little difference to the plot. The hornet's nest sequence served only to highlight Jack's inadequacy as an exterminator  The topiaries were not missed as they were probably the silliest part of the book (when I read that part remember thinking &quot;what is this, 'Day of the Triffids' all of a sudden?&quot;). The hedge maze was a place of fun turned into a trap that required paradoxial thinking (i.e. walking backwards) to foil. This was consistent with the tone of the movie and enhanced it greatly.Again., I urge viewers to watch this movie with an open mind. Don't criticize it just because it is different from the book. Instead, try to appreciate the creepy atmosphere, shockig visuals and excellent performances.",N/A
27515,"Although this movie does have some intriguing points and does a good job of bringing up age old scepticism,it inadequatly depicts Christianity by demonizing religon and lionizing the proud and rebelious.Mimi Rogers who plays Sharon does a few things that make me wonder why so many people would feel sorry for her.First of all(and I blame this largely on Hollywood)when Sharon decides to turn a new leaf and try to better herself AKA not sleeping around in promiscuous group sex,she instantly goes to a 180 extreme by rigid rules and preaching to others instead of knowing God,loving God,treating herself and others with reaspect and trying to lead a decent life.Hollywood always makes this statement that you're either extremely pious or you indulge in every kind of sin;no inbetween,how unoriginal and closeminded.Secondly,she kills her daughter one day before the rapture not because God told her to,but because of her own lack of faith.All she had to do was wait ONE DAY!That in itself shows her selfishness and how shallow her soul is.Lastly,near the end of the movie,when she is sooo angry with God(why I don't know,God did not order her to kill her daughter)she has the chance to be reunited with her daughter in Heaven if she would just accept God and His commandments.Naturally being the idiot that she is,she refuses.If any human is that proud and that self-absorbed then they don't deserve to be in Paradise.I really like Mimi Rogers,but this script was so sterotypical and biased that it would turn away anyone who was considering a religous life.",Rapture VHS
37521,"With any sequel it's difficult to have high hopes of it surpassing the original.  This rudimentary slasher flick offers nothing new, but it's difficult to say that it's a bad movie.  The story has Jesse (Patton) move in with his family to the house where Nancy from the first movie lived and watched her boyfriend get murdered across the street.  Soon he realises that his sickening nightmares are actually a manifestation of the very thing Nancy was trying to get away from - Freddy Krueger, a deformed monster who possesses Jesse in order to reak bloody havoc.  Caught up in the mess is occassional love interest Lisa (Myers).There's clearly plenty to pick out of the plot, in particular some cheesy acting and plenty of obvious turning points.  However, the gore is laid on thick, with some impressive special effects, especially for a movie made in the 80's.  There's a handful of pretty enjoyable scenes as Freddy rips his way through the pool party of a bunch of obnoxious teens.  The movie is also peppered with gay undertones, although the movie never really tells us why.  In addition, the split-personality of Jesse is never quite exploited for all its worth.  Still, there's a bizarre and appropriately surreal dream sequence at the beginning, and even if this will never truly scare it's still entertaining enough.",N/A

256210,"The Karate Kid trilogy despicably ends with one of the most pathetic movies ever produced, &quot;Karate Kid 3,&quot; which was SO stupid, in fact, that it was funny.Years after Daniel-sahn has returned home from Japan, he has yet a NEW girlfriend, and resides with Miyagi somewhere in the U.S.A.  Daniel-sahn is overweight and looking at him walk and talk, one would never guess that he even ever SAW a karate move in his entire life, much less PRACTICED one.  He looks like a chubby nerd who probably couldn't defend himself against a scrappy chihuahua puppy, let alone an adept karateka.In this flic, Daniel-sahn is coerced in numerous ways to begin training for a karate tournament that neither he nor Miyagi have any desire in entering.  Miyagi, in fact, initially refuses to train him and tells Daniel-sahn that he's on his own.  In comes Daniel's deus ex machina: One of the &quot;bad guys&quot; deceives Daniel into believing that he's a good guy that wants to train Daniel-sahn.  And he trains him by having Daniel hitting wooden boards so hard that they bludgeon his fists!  This aggressive training leads Daniel-sahn to break someone's nose, and finally the idiot gets a clue and realizes that he's been set up all along.Finally, Miyagi comes into the picture and gets Daniel back into true form in time for the tournament where Daniel faces an opponent who is clearly much more confident and aggresive than Macchio.  The tactic of Macchio's opponent -in typical, predictable fashion- is to injure Daniel-sahn as severely as possible, scoring illegal hits, then score a legal hit to win.  In typical fashion, Daniel-sahn pulls himself together and wins the last point and the movie ends.This is definitely a movie that should be submitted to Mystery Science Theater for review.  Don't get me wrong; there's plenty of comedy, but the only problem is that the producers of the movie didn't INTEND this flic to be a comedy.  Purchase this movie only if you enjoy comedies, but don't expect any of the drama and interesting plot found in the previous two Karate Kids.",The Karate Kid Part III VHS

274940,"I realize that I am in the minority here, but I have never much cared for the movie 2001. Granted there are some breathtaking picturesque scenes and the score is one cinema's great masterpieces, not to mention the grand special effects (tame by today's standards, but that was in 1968). However, the movie dragged on forever and the plot was paper thin. There was a great deal in the movie that made no sense whatsoever. 2001 was like trying to eat plastic food; it looks really nice, but it serves no function except decoration.Happily 2010 is not like that. The movie is very much plot driven (as movies should be) and is far more enjoyable to watch than it's predecessor. Roy Scheider is always a joy to watch and it's interesting to see John Lithgow in a ""regular Joe"" role instead of the quirky parts he usually plays. The movie not only has a decent plot of it's own, but it answers many of the questions that 2001 left unanswered: What happened to Dave Bowman; why did HAL go berserk; what are those monoliths near Jupiter doing.The film never reaches the artistic achievements of 2001.

Redford's metamorphosis as he moves from the hunter to the hunted is just amazing and the scene with Geer at the end of the film is one of the most poignant in movie history. Can't understand why they made Redford enunciate his words so clearly like nobody else around spoke English?The DVD transfer is outstanding and the sountrack is one of the best Hollywood ever produced.

704163,"Be prepared for a startingly novel view on this old warhorse.  McVicar's production for London's Royal Opera brings out unabashedly all of the libretto's sexual tensions, usually only hinted at in traditional productions, stunningly laid out and planted before the viewer's very eyes throughout the whole work which characterises the production's conception. In purely vocal terms the very accomplished cast is led by the immaculate Gilda of Christine Sch&auml;fer (yes, the same one you encountered ""singing"" Pierrot Lunaire exemplarily for Pierre Boulez on a DG cd, of all people), prudently set apart by McVicar as apparently the only sane person in the whole lot of characters in spite of her falling for ""Gualtier Mald&eacute;"". The Argentinian Marcelo &Aacute;lvarez is an outstanding Duke, cynical, libidinous and unhinbited as perhaps any other recent exponent of the rle, his physical presence no doubt visually supporting this. Gavanelli is a Rigoletto vocally in the grand Italian tradition, right in timbre in spite of some occasional rapid vibrato but exemplary in his diction, a rather deranged character in McVicar's view who walks about the stage in crotches; one quickly sees why he's rightly sought after by the world's leading opera houses for this rle. The other important parts, those of Sparafucile and Gilda, are also very well cast, especially the latter who must be one of the horniest Gildas on record. Visually, the production subscribes to current visions on the ways of people of wealth of four or five centuries ago: exquisite fabrics enrobing people who appear not to have visited a bathtub for many months (gone seem to be the days in which period plays, operas and movies showed immaculate participants). Sir Edward Downes' conducting with swift, vigorous tempi provokes inspired playing from the ROH's Orchestra and the sound really justifies your connecting your player to a quality sound system if you still haven't done so: it has to be heard to be believed. D&eacute;cors & staging take full advantage of the ROH's recent refurbishing, Rigoletto's and Spafucile's respective dwellings depicting a timeless and appropriate shantiness of tin roofing and carton walling that recall today's third-world capitals' misery belts. Camerawork is very good, and curiously the BBC take great pains in making you believe this was taped live by inserting applause at the ""right"" places (like after arias and ensembles or at Sir Edward's entrances to the pit at the beginning of acts); only when this applause tends to sound the same one time after the other you begin to suspect and your suspicions confirm at the end --or at least so seemed in my case-- when applause de-synchonises with what's actually happening on stage when curtain calls are taking place once the work has finished, but this is only a minor quibble. And for a change, and this is a big plus, this opera dvd does bring extra material, with a plot lecture and an enlightening interview with the producer. If you are one of those who don't make totems out of the big figures of old but are rather looking for a current, up-to-date version of Rigoletto, look no further. Mind, though, that the production is far from the ""good-to-introduce-the-kids-to-opera"" world.","Verdi - Rigoletto / Downes, Gavanelli, Schafer, Alvarez, Royal Opera House"

I could never put my finger on it but as I was watching Minority Report I never felt overly interested in the movie.  I tried to figure out why this beautifully made movie wasn't pulling me in but I couldn't, all I can say is that it was missing something that made it fall short of being one of the great movies.  I would definately recomend seing this movie, and I didn't feel cheated as I walked out of the theatre, but I did turn to my friend and say ""this is definately not a purchase (when it comes out on DVD)"".  I wasn't alone in this feeling of incompleteness.  My friends felt the same way and neither of them could put their finger on what it was either.  Also, the whole theatre full of people seemed to walk out in a daze as though they had just finished watching a documentry in history class, not as though they had just seen a great movie.  It seemed to me that everyone was impressed with the movie; it's original story, it's great special effects, but no one was overly impressed with the movie itself.

713781,"I always hated the original films because I thought they were REALLY stupid. Well, after watching part 3, I didn't watch any more until part 8, which my friend dragged me too. It [was bad], to put it mildly. Then Jason Goes to Hell came out and I went and saw it with another friend. It was a whole new studio, and I had been impressed with the coverage offered by Fangoria and had been looking forawrd to it. There was maybe 10 people at the show. It was great and I was in love with Jason as a character, although I had wished he was in it more. Now, many years later, Jason X comes on the scene. This time I went with my girlfriend. Again, there was about 10 people at the show. We all LOVED it! We all laughed at the right times, particularly the whole last half hour. This is a sci-fi comedy with horror added as spice, not as a central element. Anyway, we all thoroughly enjoyed it and everyone applauded at the end, it was fantastic! So why did this movie bomb? Well, frankly I don't know. I thought it was spoofing Hellraiser: Bloodlines and Leprachaun in Space, but I think some people took this film seriously. This film was never meant to be taken seriously. When one character says ""It's ok, he just wanted his machete back."", it's a joke people. That's not bad acting, that's not bad writing, it's a joke. A funny one at that.That being said, I do have some complaints. First, the editing. This film was completed and on the shelf for 2 years, why couldn't they fix the editing?... Also, the score just stinks. I believe I read somewhere that they hired the guy from the first one to also score this one. Why? Cheesy sythesizers [were bad]then and they [are] even worse now. My girlfriend maintains that they are spoofing those old scores, but I found it annoying. It wouldn't be so bad except the trailer was pumping with cool heavy metal music and it was certainly missed here. I also didn't like the Tomb Raider inspired robo-chick. She can't act, she didn't really further the plot and her wise-cracks got old real fast. I can overlook all of this though because this movie just rocks! The effects are great, but the real hero is the story that doesn't pull any punches and just GOES FOR IT! The film ends pitch perfect and sets up for a sequel, although that's pretty doubtful. So it looks like Jason X is the swan song of the series. There's a chance it could come back if Jason Vs. Freddy gets off the ground and is successful, but I'll believe it when I see it. Short of that, Jason X is a good bookend to the series, and shows off what all these films could have produced with a little more tweaking and more time to develop the scripts.

I believe that the movie was to show some insight to Dahmer's motives and they were somewhat successful on that (of course we'll never be able to completely understand). The most important thing was left out, the cannibalism.  Jeffrey Dahmer had bizzare murdering and raping rituals, but I believe peoples curiosity of this infamous man was the cannibalism.  The subject doesn't even get touched in the movie.  Aside from that, I thought the movie was very good.  Casting Jeremy Renner as Dahmer was a good call.  He's attractive in a understated way just as Dahmer was.  He potrays the quiet, mousy, friendly, and semi-normal personallity that Dahmer was said to have.  Some of the supporting actors weren't very good ones, but Artel Kayru (Rodney) was quite skillful in his preformance.

577485,"Contrary to many views, this is not similar to Usual Suspects. In the latter film, a man concocted a story based on information he was viewing the entire time of the police interrogation.  Here, while there is, similarly, an interrogation, the man being interrogated is not viewing anything at all. A more important difference has to do with the psychological basis for the events that unfold in the two different stories.Whether or not the suspect here is concocting a story should not be revealed for fear of spoiling the premise of this work--which is a real paradox.  Why?While the acting here is superior--especially Hugo Weaving in the role of the man under investigation--and the premise is gripping, ultimately the rationale for the events that unfold in the police station is shown to be too banal to support the powerful theme of the story.A critical difference between the two films is that The Usual Suspects involves a spectrum of shady characters in the criminal milieu, while The Interview focuses on just one.  This is important, because the opportunity for multi-layered interaction (among the criminal bunch) in Usual Suspects is present and handled very well.  Here, the interaction is strictly between the suspect and the police.  With that kind of restricted focus, there would have to be a much greater emphasis on the psychology of the two sides.  While that is true to some extent, because this film ultimately emphasizes procedural error, the entire psychological basis is trivialized--in essence, destroyed.The trivialization and virtual elimination of the psychological basis for the mental battle between the two sides itself makes the film much less than what it could and should have been.  This is really too bad, because there are some fascinating sequences.  The very last scene of the suspect alone could have been a great ending, if the focus on procedural error had been replaced by something more subtle.  As it is, this is a noble and failed effort.",The Interview

756323,"I can't believe this gem of a thriller isn't better known.Reclusive secondhand bookstore shopper Jenny Wright finds an obscure paperback original horror thriller, and loves it so much she hunts down the unknown author's only other title, ""I, Madman.""  Its story is about a psychotic surgeon scorned by the object of his affections, who, in order to please her with the perfect visage, novocains himself, cuts off his own face, and murders other people to steal their features and sew them onto himself.  But no sooner does Wright begin reading the story, than a bizarre, masked stalker begins following her around, enacting the story in real-life, killing her friends to steal their features and get closer to her.  The author of ""I, Madman,"" it seems, wasn't writing a thriller  -  he wrote his autobiography.This one's a beautifully produced low-budget winner, benefiting from solid performances, a good script, gripping suspense and just the right amount of graphic gore.  It even has a nice opening and closing surreal special effects sequence, used probably to help diminish the intensity of the film so viewers will be reminded that it's just a story, after all, and not have as many nightmares after watching as they might otherwise.Definitely not for the faint of heart or squeamish of stomach, but lovers of thrillers and horror flicks will be more than satisfied.","I, Madman"
200095,"""Going My Way"" is not exactly one of the most perfect of all movies ever made. And it's not the most deserving ""Best Picture"" winner of 1944 either. The reasons I make those statements are 1.) It's somewhat corny and simplistic, with a few subplots and scenes that do work but still could have been left out. And 2.) Many people, including myself, would name ""Double Indemnity"", ""Gaslight"", ""Laura"", ""Meet Me in St. Louis"" or ""Murder, My Sweet"" as more deserving winners. But awards aren't really the best way to judge a movie's greatness because it's a matter of personal opinion. And ""Going My Way"" is a really good movie, despite these flaws.The movie is a great star vehicle for Bing Crosby, who portrays a priest named Father O'Malley sent to help another church run by cranky old Father Fitzgibbon (Barry Fitzgerald). Fitzgibbon, who's run the church for 45 years (""46 in October""), is in debt problems with the savings and loans run by Ted Haines Sr. (Gene Lockhart). Fitzgibbon, at first, is not excited by his new assistant's unorthodox methods of practice, such as wearing a baseball uniform when his priest clothing gets wet. He also doesn't care much for O'Malley's liking of golf along with fellow priest Father Timothy (Frank McHugh), remarking that there is too much work to allow games. Fitzgibbon tries to go to the bishop to get O'Malley transferred. But after hearing good things about Father O'Malley and being patient, O'Malley starts to grow on him. Eventually, the old bat starts to lighten up until, by film's end, his church is out of debt and he claims to be ten years younger. He even starts playing golf and other games.Fitzgerald is very good in the role, being sensitive or strict when the time comes. The interaction that he and Crosby have is marvelous. I also love his leprechaunish voice, which is most likely because he comes from Ireland. He received Oscar nominations for both Best Actor and Best Supporting Actor, the only such incident in the academy's history, and deservedly won Supporting Actor.But Bing has several very good to great scenes, which were probably a major factor in his Best Actor win. His performances of the title song and, with the help of the choir, ""Swinging on a Star"" are upbeat and entertaining. I also enjoyed the scene where he gives advice to a troubled young girl named Carol James (Jean Heather) on how to be a better singer and she follows it (A wise move I might add).Now for the movie's problems. There are a couple scenes that could have been excised from the film at the cutting room. About half an hour through the film, after visiting the bishop, Fitzgibbon is talked into keeping O'Malley at the church. But then, he leaves the church at night only to return some hours later. What does this scene mean? I think it was meant to show Fitzgibbon is thinking about whether he wants to stay in charge, for when he returns he says its only temporarily. Also, after that scene, there is one between him and O'Malley that shows character development for Fitzgibbon in how he longs to see his mother, whom he hasn't meet in 45 years. Yet another scene that could have been taken out is when O'Malley watches a performance of ""Ava Maria"" at the Metropolitan by singer Genevieve Linden (Rise Stevens), an old friend of ""Chuck"" (The nickname used by his friends). Both the song and Steven's performance of it are great, but it doesn't do much except slow the pace. And her impressive singing isn't enough to sway a publisher into buy some of Chuck's songs.There are also a couple of subplots. First with Carol and Ted Haines Jr. (James Brown), son of the Savings and Loans manager. This plot shows how O'Malley's advice helped the two straighten out their lives. Ted Sr. visits his son to find out why he quit his job, and finds out it was for a reason relevant to the time. There is also a plot that has some punk kids, who are more of a nuisance than a threat, getting help from O'Malley by forming a choir. By the film's end, they are straightened out and like singing even more than baseball or, the worst of their crimes, hijacking poultry trucks.The movie has several touching moments, most notably the ending when Fitzgibbon receives a big surprise. The surprise was arranged by O'Malley whom, since he is being transferred out, did it as a farewell gift. I admit that I'm not one for crying, having been hardened by too many action movies (Plus I wasted a lot of tears of ""Titanic"" back when I was 10 years old). But my eyes were just a bit misty as the choir started ""Too-ra-Loo-ra-Loo-ra"". Maybe in a few years I will come back and find this to be even sadder. For now, I'll read more of mother's Harlequin romances.I found certain themes here to be similar to those covered in a later movie: ""It's a Wonderful Life"". O'Malley influences and helps out many people in the movie who wouldn't have been better off without him. The only difference is that O'Malley, unlike the later film's protagonist, already knows that he has done great things before the movie ends. At the end, he walks out of the church with no formal thanks. He doesn't need one because he's the kind of person who doesn't ask in return.With a fine supporting cast, great songs, many humorous and touching scenes, ""Going My Way"" is movie I'm glad I watched. It may not be the best Oscar winner, but it made me sigh in one respect: Though ""Double Indemnity"" is an excellent (One of my favorites), how many remakes, homages, and spoofs have been done of that compared to ""Going My Way""? I guess schmaltz doesn't sell.",Going My Way VHS

602196,"Some including myself didn't think  Brett Ratner (Rush Hour) was a suitable choice to direct Red Dragon when it was first announced. However he easily put all my doubts to rest after me viewing the film. Don't get me wrong Maichael Mann (Heat, The Insider) is a fine director but I think he had the wrong idea with Manhunter. Sure it was good but the whole look of the movie was wrong, plus he sorta made it too sexy. It's sorta like Hannibal Lector on an episode of Miami Vice or Nash Bridges. Ratner does so much more with a lot of the same material and took a lot more of a darker and scarier approach. Hell even Danny Elfman's score is much superior to the typicla 80's drama musical score in Manhunter. On the subject of Hannibal, Brian Coxx just wasn't menacing enough and doesn't have the over the top but fun presence that Hopkins does. I saw Red Dragon and then watched Manhunter and Coxx has a lot of the same dialogue that Hopkins has in Dragon but just says the lines with no energy. He even lacks the expressions of Hopkins and that insane look in his eyes. Coxx looked bored playing Hannibal but Hopkins you can just tell he loves  playing him.Edward Norton plays Will Graham, who William Peterson played in Manhunter and their couldn't of been a better choice. However I saw a review on tv where this women said Hopkins and Norton are the only reason to see Red Dragon and I disagree totally. Ralph Fiennes (Strange Days) and Emily Watson are excellent in supporting roles. Think they both should be nominated actually. The idea of a mad man who thinks he's hideous falling in love with a blind women who has no way of knowing the type of man she's with is ingenious. Dragon does so much more with those 2 characters than Manhunter did too. They both have a lot  more human emotion and character build up than in Manhunter too. Plus like I said Hopkins is back but as the Lector you loved in Silence of the Lambs and not the insane Martha Stewart one in Hannibal. The beginning he has a little fun cooking for guests but that scene is a lot less gross than the one in Hannibal. Well anyway I'd love to see Hopkins return for yet another serving as Hannibal, possibly this time Clarice and Graham could team up to catch him.",N/A

This has to be one of the funniest movies I've ever seen.  Every performance, from Witherspoon to Keifer Sutherland to Veronica Cartwright, is a tour-de-force.  Witherspoons plays Vanessa, a modern day Red Riding Hood on a journey to meet her long-lost grandmother, running away from the Child Services Department after her alcoholic, drug-addicted mother [Cartwright] is once again arrested for solicitation.  On her way, she encounters Sutherland, a child psychologist of dubious nature.  There's the ensuing hilarity, poignant moments and satisfying resolution.Why should you see this movie?  Because it's downright hysterical.  Reward yourself with a movie that you'll laugh through from start to finish and never skip through.",Freeway VHS

I was struck by Bertolucci's use of vivid color and texture throughout the film, and of how Kit's journey from beginning to end leaves her with an almost transcendant perspective on her own life and the world.  I am not sure if the old man in the cafe is played by the author Bowles himself, but it seems as though his presence is a kind of bookend effect; he sends his character out into the unknown and is there to receive her when her journey has ended.

661007,"CHOCOLAT lacks action and heavy drama. Also, outside of Judi Densch's best-supporting nominated performance, the acting isn't all that great. Johnny Depp shows up at the end of the film, but his appearance is more of a cameo than a performance.The movie itself isn't bad. The story has a good moral (tolerance) and the setting of a small 1950s French village is beautiful. However, the film isn't all that great; it's just average. The film's story is just another rehashed version of a water-downed Hollywood favorite: an outsider with liberal values moves to a small secluded place, the outsider is threatened, but in the end the outsider ""enlightens"" the people about their backward ways.Tolerance and forgiveness are essential in life. Jesus was all about forgiveness and Christians should be the most forgiving people. There are some Christians who aren't very tolerant or forgiving, but many are. Therefore, why are Christians almost always the bad guys in modern movies? Overall, CHOCOLAT looks tasty, but doesn't have much filling.",N/A

Or consider the synopsis of the plot - a family of dsyfunctional geniuses reconcile after decades of failure.  Open the package of this DVD and you will immediately notice the love in which the film was made, right down to the personable scetches created by the director's brother.Now imagine watching this movie and have all you're expectations met or exceeded.  That was my experience. This movie has become one of my all-time favorite films, something I've treasured and pondered long after I watched it.Nothing at all is ordinary in this film.  The presense of Angelia Huston gave me the impression of a modern-day Addams Family, most everything bizarre and fascinating like that family was.  The exiled head of the family, Royal Tenenbaum, attempts to reconcile with everyone by pulling a [quick one] on them.  Richard Tenenbaum falls in love with his sister and lives in a tent in the middle of his room.  Clas Tenenbaum is a childhood business mogol who is obsessed with safety after his wife dies, and thus dresses himself and his children in identical, bright-red jumpsuits.Each scene plays out like the characters - highly defined, quick witted and quick paced, backed with energy and emotion, and before you realized everything you saw, you're on to the next one.  The conflicts resolve in a satisfying yet never-predictable way - nothing you ever are hoping for happens, and yet everyone ends up happy.  The messages of redemption after failure are my favorite, and give this movie itself greatest weight.  To watch this family work through its incredible problems is a source of hope to even the most bitter person.",The Royal Tenenbaums

663700,"This is a failed attempt at a Stephen King-ish story. A straight-to-video rehash of other (and better) movies about a troubled writer and his troubled but devoted wife who move into a great big old scary house way out in the ""marsh"". They are both grieving the recent loss of their only child--a little boy--to a sudden freak death (he swallowed a wasp in his cereal!). The husband becomes surly and starts pounding out his new ""bestseller"" on the computer while the wife starts seeing things and getting supernatural ""messages"" that she only has so many days to live---5 then 4 then 3 and so on. The husband doesn't believe her and goes totally bonkers while the wife desperately tries to figure out whats going on. Then TA-DA! She finds out the property is built on a huge mass grave of murdered convicts! If any of this sounds familiar, the story borrows shamelessly from ""The Shining"" and ""Poltergeist""- even the ending with corpses coming up in the basement and the wife running around with a big butcher knife to get away from the crazed hubby is all too familiar. Only this go 'round, they both survive and write the bestseller that saves the husband's career: ""7 Days to Live"" based on their experiences! Hogwash.

521404,"How do you take the best selling comic book and turn it into something that everyone will enjoy?  Well you got yourself the best example ever in X-Men.First off we all know the story, mutants, Professor X, and Wolverine.  It's all good, the fan boys have bought this film to death.  So my review is geared towards the non-fan boys.  Because they should be the only ones that do not own this film yet.By the way fan boy = comic book lover.So heres the dealeo.  X-Men starts off by telling us the tragic story of how mutants and humans are having trouble coexisting, this burr is stuck between a certain senators unmentionables.  Thus creating stress between the two races.  In comes Magneto (picture villian with power to control magnetism)a mutant with a cause.  To kick all humans ....  Here enters Prof. X the good guy with mind powers and his X-Men (basically lots of mutants that help the fella out)  Plus we get treated to how these characters focus around two other mutants, Rogue and Wolverine who meet up in the Canadian outback.  The story then progesses along and well I won't tell you anymore, sorta ruins the whole movie watching process.The DVD in itself is awesome with really neat interactive menus and lots of goodies to keep one entertained for awhile.  But I think they should have at least added in mutant biographies to give non-comic fans an idea of who these characters are and describe them a bit better.  All in all though..it's still super well done.The story and movie is excellent as it has a lot of action scenes to keep everyone buckled in.  Plus the acting is a pure treat to watch.  The actors in this movie really made it work.  Just a great movie to sit down and watch.In closing, if your not a comic book fan and thinking ""eh is it really worth it?"" my answer yes it is, it is at least a must rent and a eventual must own.  Great watch and feast for the eyes, the special effects are great and nothing is done below the par level.  So go out and get this film people, what still reading this review?  Go! Shoo!By the way, fan boys not having this film yet (unless of course your anti marvel) you better go out and get it. Nuff' Said.Till next time true believers. Excelsior!",X-Men VHS
519958,"I really, really did not like this movie. Saying this when almost all the other reviews are well written explanations of why this movie deserves 5 stars is very difficult indeed. Nevertheless, after seeing this movie I felt very disappointed. I am a fan of both fantasy and science fiction, and I read and enjoyed (to some extend) one of the books in the Lord of the Rings series. So it is not that I just dislike fantasy/sci-fi.The reason I disliked this movie is that when I saw it in the theaters I almost fell asleep. There was no dramatic tension at all. Although I have to admit the opening sequences were very good, and the special effects and scenery were great - I would claim that the filmmakers got totally carried away with special effects. Once the hobbit and company started fighting computer generated monsters, I grew less and less interested until I was at the point of walking out of the theater! I mean, I have nothing against fighting in movies, especially fighting with well done special effects - but enough is enough! After a point there is no more excitement, and it becomes monotonous and dull.Honesty, the sad thing about movies today is that the reliance on special effects has led to a decline in the quality of the other aspects of the film, such as dialogue, creativity, etc, etc. In my opinion, there is nothing interesting in watching hours of computer generated fighting scenes. Come on - where is the excitement in that?In addition to the excessive fighting, I feel that this movie was badly acted. In one scene, there was a close up on the hobbit's face after somebody was killed (the fact that I don't remember who shows how much I really cared at that point) - and the whole theater began laughing out loud. I don't think that this was the desired effect, somehow.Anyhow, this is only my personal opinion. After viewing the movie, I felt that it was very bad due to the excessive fighting (and subsequent lack of creative dialogue, character development, etc, etc.) and poor acting. Hollywood really needs to go back to watching some classic movies - which did not use any special effects - because it seems that filmmakers have lost the ability to entertain audiences without massive doses of sepcial effects. And even worse, as proved by this movie, sometimes even special effects cannot make a dull movie interesting...",The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring

The fact that the record stood all these years with an asterix behind it, was unfair to Maris because his accomplishment was astounding and took many years to be matched.Billy Crystal brought the story forward to when Maris's record was broken, with actual footage of the Maris family.

The film portrays him as a conquistador-turned-healer.  The church--which even now pushes to make Junipero Serra, religious conquerer of California, a saint, having learned nothing about the damage done by the colonizer mentality--considers him a great patron of Christianizing the heathen Natives.  Some of the advocates of Native rights, voice, and history condemn him as a well-intentioned point man for the subsequent Spanish, and then Anglo, waves of conquest surging into Norteamerica.Whomever he was (and do e-mail me if you know much about him, because I'm curious), I like to think that the Seven Cities of Gold were metaphysical experiences not to be taken so literally.

Also included are the great comedic episode, ""Out of Their Minds,"" and the dramatic ""My Three Crichtons."" In terms of quality, this is the best out of the second season sets so far, since every episode is a gem.""Out of Their Minds"" takes an old sci-fi chestnut (the main characters all switch bodies), and completely turns it on its head in typical ""Farscape"" fashion. This episode is fun, fun, fun in the same vein as ""Crackers Don't Matter,"" (although not as dark) and ""Through the Looking Glass"" (although not quite as wack-a-do). A true classic.""My Three Crichtons"" takes another classic sci-fi cliche, in that John is split into three versions of himself. The twist, though, is that one is at the bottom of the evolutionary scale, a caveman early-man prototype, the second is the regular human him, and the third is a John Crichton of the future, further evolved than the average human, with a large skull, to hold his much-bigger brain. This episode, despite its jokey title, is a dark, involving hour.And then the crown jewel of the set...The entire ""Look at the Princess"" trilogy, composed of Part 1, ""A Kiss is But a Kiss,"" Part 2, ""I Do, I Think,"" and Part 3, ""The Maltese Crichton.""

Rex Harrison was an absolutely perfect Professor Higgins and never wavered or changed character.  My problem (a minor one) is with the ending and with the dubbing.The story is brilliant of course, taken from George Bernard Shaw's acclaimed play Pygmalion, although materially altered to fit the requirements of a musical comedy.  The contrast of the unschooled street urchin Liza Doolittle and the stuffy, self-possessed confirmed bachelor, a kind of nineteenth century British man of science, wonderfully accomplished in his profession, but blind to himself when it comes to relationships with other people, made for a most interesting match.  And the delusive dream of a man forming his own perfect woman (which is the basis of the Pygmalion legend) works so very well with a conceited linguist tutoring a cockney girl.  The entire concept is a work of genius with the drunken father and the objectifying Col. Pickering and the very right Mrs. Pierce.But there are some problems.  Freddy is needed of course as another &quot;objectifying&quot; character to make it clear just how desirable Eliza really is and how foolish and blind Professor Higgins is in not seeing this--in theory, of course, because in practice with Audrey Hepburn or Julie Andrews as Eliza, this would seem entirely unnecessary.  And indeed without Freddy we do not have the beautiful &quot;On the Street Where You Live.&quot;  But even with him Prof. Higgins does not see, and indeed even at the resolution of the story, he still does not see, as he asks for his slippers.  If this were presented to current London and Broadway audiences it would never play the way it was written.  Professor Higgins would need to see the light and he would have to get his own slippers!The dubbing and the need for it is curious.  There is no doubt that Marni Nixon, who did the singing, has a beautiful and commanding voice, and we are the better for having heard her, but why is the dubbing so obvious?  It's almost as if Miss Hepburn is saying to the audience: they said it would be better if Miss Nixon sings instead of me because her voice is stronger and so very well trained.  And so Hepburn does not completely lip-sync some of the opening words of songs as though to remind us that she is not singing.  And the contrast between her delicate voice and then the sudden power of Marni Nixon's is obvious.  Beyond this is the question of why Julie Andrews, who has a voice to match that of Miss Nixon, and charisma and charm at least in the same ballpark as Miss Hepburn, wasn't asked to play the part that she knew so very well from her experience on the stage.  Still, as another reviewer has so acutely noted, if she had been asked, we would have missed her in Mary Poppins, which was made the same year.  I should also note that Hepburn was 33 or 34 years old when this was made (although she looked almost ten years younger).  Nonetheless she was playing the part of &quot;a good girl, I am,&quot; whom Pickering identifies in his call to Scotland Yard as being 21 years old.Curious.  But all is forgiven because Audrey Hepburn is just so beautiful, so elegant and so delightful in the part.  I especially loved her in the opening scene in her soiled clothes and hat and her sour voice.  By the way, I have heard Julie Andrews sing the part, although I never saw her on the stage, and the way she &quot;meow's&quot; Eliza's accent, like a cat's claw on a chalk board, is really amazing.  (Get the CD.)This is one of the best movie musicals ever made, a sheer delight highlighted not only by Rex Harrison and Audrey Hepburn, but by Stanley Holloway as the Liza's lovable rascal father and Wilfrid Hyde-White as the very understanding and very properly British Col. Pickering with opulent direction by the great George Cukor.  The sets and production numbers are gorgeous.  But see it for Audrey Hepburn, one of the great stars of the silver screen in one of her most memorable roles.",N/A

414552,"First off, I must say this, I've never seen the first two Mighty Ducks movies and I'm not especially a hockey lover. But I must confess I thought this movie was terrific and fun! Mostly aimed for teenagers, this is a great movie to watch!The whole team &quot;Mighty Ducks&quot; have won scholarships to prestigious Eden Hall: Charlie (Joshua Jackson), Goldberg (Shaun Weiss), Fulton (Elden Henson), Averman (Matt Doherty), Julie 'the Cat' (Colombe Jacobsen-Derstine), Russ (Kenan Thompson), Dwayne (Ty O'Neal), Luis (Mike Vitar), Ken (Justin Wong), Guy Germaine (Garette Ratliff Henson), Connie (Marguerite Moreau), and Adam (Vincent Larusso). But there are some changes for the team. First of all, one of the 'Basher Brothers' Dean Portman (Aaron Lohr) is not going to join them. But most important, their coach Gordon Bombay (Emilio Estevez) won't be coaching them anymore. Charlie can't accept that and even more can't accept their seemingly harsh new coach, Ted Orion (Jeffrey Nordling). The 'Mighty Ducks' have a big game ahead of them against the Varsity team 'Warriors' who are going to be hard to beat. Will they be able to beat them and show them who's the best?With plenty of suspense and humor, &quot;D3: The Mighty Ducks&quot; is certainly worth the watch. Terrific acting done by the whole cast, including the notable actor Joss Ackland who plays Hans, the good friend and mentor to the 'Ducks'. The suspense during the hockey games were sometimes pretty intense, especially the last game between the 'Ducks' and the 'Warriors'. As for the humor, the movie was hilarious, I was laughing most of the time!A few of my favorites parts are when the 'Ducks' play pranks on the Varsity team and when Bombay gives his little 'speech' to the board members of Eden Hall. And a few of my favorite lines is:Cheerleader: Cheerleaders only. Are you a cheerleader?Linda: Do I look like an idiot?Connie: This ninja stuff makes you look, I don't know, how would you say...Guy Germaine: Ruggedly handsome?Connie: Amazingly stupid.Dwayne (while swinging a lariat at one of the Varsity members): It would be more fun for me if you ran.For parents, the movie is rated PG for the reason that there are some bad words sprinkled here and there. Other than that and the game of hockey being pretty rough, it's pretty good! I can't wait to watch the first two movies! I hope they're as good as the third one! If you haven't seen this movie, I highly recommend it!",D3 - The Mighty Ducks VHS
557160,"This movie is a must-see for anyone who enjoys war flicks, or who has an interest in the American Revolution.  It is not a perfect movie, but its strong points overwhelm the relatively few week ones.  Mel Gibson does his customary stellar job, and the acting overall is pretty good, and the story is very good indeed.  An unabashedly pro-American movie, but then again what's wrong with that?  It is still legal to make the odd movie that happens to celebrate American patriotism.The thing I liked best about the movie is that it really did convey a sense of what it might have been like to live in American revolutionary times.  It was a long war and a hard war, and ideals had to have been what kept the outgunned and outmanned patriots going.  The Brits are portrayed as the bad guys, but not, except for one villain, as bad guys.  I get a kick out of recommending this movie to my British friends.The story keeps going, there is a beginning, a middle, and an exciting ending.  That's more than can be said of most movies nowadays.  A keeper and a must for any DVD collection.",N/A
691391,"I have to admit: when I first saw the series I wasn't really thrilled. Of course, I only saw the German version which was dubbed in the former G.D.R. This version was censored quite heavily. For instance every reference to Holmes' drug abuse was cut out, which happens to be an important aspect of Holmes' personality. Being used to the film versions with Basil Rathbone and Peter Cushing I also thought that Jeremy Brett was quite overacting. Today I am ashamed of that.I challenge you: read the original stories by Sir Arthur Conan Doyle - you will never find a better and finer Holmes on film than the one performed by Jeremy Brett. And let's not forget Watson. Finally there is a real Doctor and not a mere comic relief. David Burke and in later seasons Edward Hardwicke are a pure joy to watch. Furthermore in every episode you have a great cast. Some of the biggest talents British TV has to offer.The producers went to a great deal of trouble to make the series as ""right"" as possible. Although Baker Street 221b didn't exist in Holmes' time the production designers recreated a room of the exact proportions that would have fit in a house of that time and area. Every detail was thoroughly investigated, like the colour and shape of the drapes or the carpet. Another important reference were the original book illustrations by artist Sidney Paget. His pictures literally come to live. Nothing is missing, not even the Persian slipper where Holmes keeps his tobacco.This boxed set (The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes) is the complete first season. Just watch out for the next titles of the series. Let's hope we don't have to wait too long for them.",The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes

While at the same time, a detective(Lindo),who has had a bad past with Raines, is trying to catch him in the act so he can 'put him away' for good. Sounds corny huh?

He decides to leave the house to find himself, we could say that what he finds out is that that life was the one that he longed for, but that's simplistic as hell. So, while he is out there thinking how it was that he fell out of love, his best buddy Sam (Jeff Daniels) has finally found the one girl he's looked for all his life -or is she?. This 1988 film starred Don Johnson in the best work of his career (so far) and Susan Sarandon in some kind of post-Springsteen characters story (theirs was the idyllic marriage, they were the king and queen of high school) and they are now trapped in the routine of marriage.

529026,"I already have written a review on ""Almost Famous,"" after I saw it in the earlier part of 2001.  However, rumor of this ""Bootleg Cut""  kept me from purchasing the original.  When mom used to say ""patience is a virtue,"" this was one of those reasons to take her on her word!Writer/Producer/Director Cameron Crowe presents ""Almost Famous"" in it's original incarnation titled: ""Untitled!""  Yes, you heard right.  Crowe finally had the chance to insert the sequences that explained more of his characters, gave him a better piece of mind, and probably told things that wouldn't be understood by the audience (the film originally ran 2 hours long, and the 35 minutes that appear in ""Untitiled"" would probably make some squrim out of boredom in their seats).For those not sure of the film, here's the summary:  William Miller is a young man trapped in a family with an overbearing mother and her hope that one day, he will become a great lawyer.  But in actuality, William loves Rock and Roll, and he uses his love of music to write reviews and reports for several local and underground papers.  One day, Rolling Stone magazine gets ahold of his work, and asks William to do a story for them.  William then takes to the road with the up and coming band called ""Stillwater,"" where he meets the lead guitarist Russell Hammond(Billy Crudup), and even the infamous Penny Lane(Kate Hudson), a young girl who's the most enigmatic screen presence you may ever see.The extras that Crowe includes in this DVD set include audio commentary by himself and (possibly a first for an audio guest) his Mom!  She's very informative, and also helps keep the conversation lively.  There's also a longer cut of a scene featuring the band ""Still Water,"" as well as articles Crowe wrote for Rolling Stone in his youth (this film is actually a biopic of his life, with some fiction).  There is also a great interactive scene that requires you to have Led Zeppelin's ""Stairway to Heaven"" on audio, CD, Vinyl or any form you can get your hands on it.  Trust me, get a copy of ""Stairway"" if you get this DVD set. What it's for is a great scene that was cut because they couldn't get the copyright for the song.As an added bonus, there is a 6-song CD featuring the music written for the band ""Stillwater"" in the film.  Every single song is Excellent!  Not a bad one in the bunch.The set contains the original cut of the film on Disc 2, which is a great way to compare the cut for the big screen, and the true director's vision.The film has been known to off-put some people ( almost all my family didn't like it), but for those that like music, nostalgia, and a film that is really unlike what most people create or experience, this is a great set to get.",Almost Famous

The animation is very neat and looks great, but the cliched over the top ridiculous storyline and borderline terrible voice acting just about kills anything enjoyable with Golgo 13: Queen Bee.  The Queen Bee, a female guerilla renegade who seems to have sex with just about anything that moves, is really the main character here and Duke is in more of a supporting role.

The movie saved the cheesy feminine touch which is so part of the characters and of the whole story, and added a modern twist. Today's ""angels"" are funnier, sexier, and they have more special effects on their side!Cameron Diaz plays a sweet, naive girl who dreams of being a dancer, and is instead a butt-kicking ""angel""; Lucy Liu has a fianc&eacute;e who doesn't know what her real job is, and she dreams of becoming a great cook and a great wife for him, so she gets very annoyed when her souffle gets shot (in an attempt to kill her) at and therefore looses all its puffiness; Drew Barrimore is the brat of the situation, my personal favorite.The characters are taken too far on purpose, and that's what makes them funny.

704062,"I have had something like a thirty year desire to see this, director Luchino Visconti's second film. To my knowledge, it has never enjoyed wide theatrical distribution, which given its content and tone, is hardly surprising. A relentlessly downbeat view of the lives of Sicilian fishermen, it's also a tad on the long side. Still, to have it available on video is a wonderful treat. I can't imagine myself watchiing it frequently, but it has a compositional integrity that more than compensates for the depressing subject matter.Never having seen the film projected, I cannot gauge the effectiveness of the video transfer. My guess is that it is so-so: good enough to give a sense of what the film looks like but not produced with enough care to bring out all the richness of detail and contrast. The opening credits, for example, superimposed over images of dawn in the fishing village, are barely intelligible. With a little more effort, the disc producers could probably have found a way to make the sequence work on video. As it is, we more or less have to imagine what it would look like.""La Terra Trema"" is Italian Neorealism at its most epic. Unlike De Sica's ""Bicycle Thief,"" for example, which reveals the tragedy of one man's decline, ""Terra"" self-consciously uses the Valastro family as an example of a larger phenomenon. Visconti makes no effort to conceal his political prejudices, at one point clearly identifying the corrupt, exploitive wholesalers with the recently deposed Mussolini regime while relentlessly identifying the central characters' problems with social and economic forces.The hopelessness of the situation is relieved only by the internal cohesion of the family which, nonetheless, undergoes severe tests. While we can well imagine the Valastros sinking even lower after the film's ambiguous ending, what is most striking about the film more than fifty years after its release, is its essential *optimism.* The call for a united front to withstand exploitation is good, old-fashioned Marxism at its most bald and unapologetic. The film's unabashed faith in human nature and the possibility of positive change feels not so much naive as nostalgic, the product of a time when it was still possible to believe in broad, systemic change. Wrapped in Visconti's well-known eye for sensuous spectacle, ""La Terra Trema"" is a good two-and-a-half hour tract just shy of convincing.",La Terra Trema
525677,"(Note: this review is of the movie as released in theaters, not of the DVD, which promises to come out with several more hours of deleted scenes.)I just saw HP for the second time in the theaters yesterday, after practically memorizing all four books.  My brother and I were quite disappointed, while my mother enjoyed it.  Probably because she'd never read the books.The difficulty I had with the movie is that it made *such* an effort to be true to the book, that the 90% of the book that was cut for time was all the more obvious and disappointing.  The end result was a set of disjointed scenes that contained the bare minumum of information that the screenwriters could convey and still advance the plot.Most of the character development (and actually, several of the *characters*) was cut for time.  All dialogue was so intent on getting the needed information to the audience in as short a time as possible, that the conversations seemed forced - quite unlike the natural flow of the book's dialogue.  And the humor - one of the biggest strengths of the books - was eliminated almost entirely (Fred and George, for example, had a grand total of three short scenes and two jokes).  The most touching scenes of the book (Dumbledore's &quot;she loved you&quot; exchange with Harry at the end, and Hagrid's gift of the pictures of Harry's parents) were present, but rushed and not developed, and so they carried no emotional impact.  Particularly since the movie cut most of the information that would have gotten across just how starved for love Harry had been with the Dursleys.As for the acting, it was passable.  Harry's actor needs some work.  Ron and Hermione are well played, as are Snape, Quirell, and Hagrid.  Dumbledore (what little we saw of him) was well-played, but seemed considerably more tired than I pictured.  I saw no twinkle in his eyes, and he wasn't nearly as inspiring as in the books.Most of my problems relate to the cutting, which was of course necessary because of time constraints.  I just hate to see what they'll do to Book 4..",N/A
570832,"It's very true that sequels rarely match the quality of the original film (in fact, we're often lucky if they're even WATCHABLE).  The original Blair Witch Project was an effective horror film.  While it didn't exactly scare me, it stayed with me, and I wouldn't ever go camping right after watching that film-no way!  But I had heard that the sequel was a horrible movie, and I only watched it after reading two reviews that praised the film.  But when I did watch it, I was utterly shocked.  Let's just say that I'm frustrated with all the people who told me that this was a terrible movie, because their comments almost kept me from watching one of the best horror films I've ever seen.The plot is fairly predictable-we've seen this all before.  A group of people agree to spend the night at a spot that's supposed to be haunted, cursed, etc. hoping to witness some supernatural phenomena.  They bring cameras to record such phenomena if it occurs.  Terrifying events ensue.  What sets this film apart is the strong sense of forboding that looms over the characters right from the beginning.  The atmosphere is perfect-you know that something is going to happen, something bad, but you don't know what.  And when it does happen, it's not what you expect (or rather, it doesn't happen the way you'd expect it to).  No horrible monsters jump out and kill the main characters, no, this film is into portraying a far more subtle, powerful evil.  The 5 main characters attempt to stay awake the entire night, but they awaken the next morning and discover that they've fallen asleep, and they don't remember what happened in the last 5 hours.  One of the characters lives at an abandoned broom factory (ha ha) and so the group meets there to view the footage they recorded during the night, in hopes of finding out what happened to them during those 5 hours.From the beginning, there are clues that things are not what they seem to be.  The greatest triumph of this film is that it leaves you puzzling over what happened-what is true and what isn't?  Exactly what role did the supernatural play in the events that unfolded after the group met that night in the woods?  Is it safe to assume, as one character states, that ""video doesn't lie""?In recent years, we have seen an increasing number of ""self-aware"" horror films (ha ha, look at us, we're poking fun at the horror genre`) and that's fine.  But I've missed truly scary horror films, films that portrayed evil as something truly bad-horrifying, powerful, and able to ruin lives.  This film captures that spirit perfectly.  Don't play around with evil, it'll get inside you, mess you up, and then kill you.  That's genuinely scary, that's what horror movies are supposed to do, and that's what this film does perfectly.  So don't listen to all the reviewers who hated this movie.  It's not for everyone, but many highly intelligent people enjoyed this film, and I would go as far as to say that it's even better than the original.",N/A

Well it was a bit like it, but it set itself apart too. I really get into these types of movies but mainstream movie goers will probably feel as though they've wasted their money. Personally I hope to see it again in the theater just to make sure I got it all. My recommendations if youre going to see this movie, see with a friend or loved one, and see it quick because once Gangs of New York comes out, then this will be gone. (if its there that long.)This is by far George Clooney's best movie since ""Out of Sight"". He can really act if given the right script and movie to play in. He did a good job of being the lonely guy. And you can tell right off that something has gone wrong and he feels responsible.I felt this movie moved along nicely. It keeps you guessing but not too much. It wraps up nicely with no loose ends. They weave bits and pieces of science versus morality in with threads of human anxiety and morality. Overall it seemed chilling and a bit eerie with some obvious Sci-fi references thrown in for fun.But alas, this is a love story. and I felt that S. Sodobergh did a good job of putting that element at the forefront. I would say if you have patience go and see this at the matinee, or just wait and get the DVD.",Solaris
701518,"I watched this movie as a joke.  The first movie was okay but that's comparing it with the book.  This ""sequel"" (only by name) is meant to be a satire I think but it came off as a joke to me.  I laughed at it and actually was entertained by how bad it really was.  It's a badly made movie by a director who obviously did it for the paycheck (we hope) but I couldn't help laughing and getting a kick out of this movie.  This movie will definitely have an audience and a cult following (a small one but large enough to be classified as a cult following) but for most people, it will be horrible.  Just take it as a comedy and you might actually enjoy it.  Then again....you could make some sort of drinking game out of this movie I bet lol.",N/A
262922,"Clownhouse (Victor Salva, 1988)I really don't want to say Clownhouse is a bad film. I mean, you've got a standup comic (Tree) dressed up as a  psychotic killer clown menacing three teenage boys with his two equally psychotic associates. It's a late-eighties horror flick. I mean, how bad can it be?Well, the answer is, pretty bad. And as much as the recent rash of email chain letters attempting to get Salva's  films boycotted drives me to want to contribue to Salva's coffers, I'd rather watch Powder for twenty-four hours back-to-back than sit through this dog again. Salva enjoys descending  into the realm of teen sex comedy humor all too often, including the inevitable masturbation jokes. Salva (who also wrote the screenplay) has a less then fine ear for  dialog. At times, in fact, it gets positively hideous.It probably says more than I ever could about the film that only two of the ten top-billed actors in the film, Sam  Rockwell (whose film debut was Clownhouse, and who has since gone on to such films as The Green Mile, Heist, and Galaxy Quest) and Karlheinz Teuber (coming back to the screen  next year in Kung Phooey), made more than one film after Clownhouse.Do yourself a favor and avoid it like the plague. * 1/2",N/A

It's so refreshing to watch a film showing the men in the military the proud, brave, courageous, honorable men that they are. This film doesn't depict soldiers as the cartoonish soldier who doesn't feel pain. This movie showed their human side, they were friends, they were shot, they were hurt, they died, and they stood next to their buddies protecting each other until they were killed or out of amunition and then killed.

408146,"I watched this movie on the recommendation of a couple of frequent movie viewers.  This film was fun to watch on a rainy Sunday morning.  It was not profound, and while most of the characters have a happy resolution of their problems, the film will not appeal to all.  If you are a Jane Austen fan and love Emma in particular, the film will appeal to you for three reasons - firstly, the heroine Flora Poste slings off Jane Austen quotes and references (beginning with her intention to write her ""Persuasion"" when she is 53);  secondly, because Flora acts much like Emma in trying to improve and manage the lives of others (without being blind to her own true love);  and lastly, because the heroine Flora is played by Kate Beckinsale (who will go to to play Emma in the Andrew Davis/A&E; version, called Emma 3).  There are also a number of other stellar actors, most notably Sir Ian McKellen (playing a hell-raising preacher) and Eileen Atkins (playing his sad-sack cousin/wife).I have not read the book nor seen the 1971 version, and therefore can judge the film only by its own merits.  While the film left me with a smile on my face, it also left me a little puzzled.  What was Judith Starkadder's real problem, why does she feel the family owes something to Robert Poste's child, and what did Aunt Ada Doom see in the woodshed?A brief plot summary:  London society girl Flora Poste discovers that she has only 100 pounds a year, which will not keep her in stockings.  She decides to write to her many relatives to see if one of them will take her in (this is the 1930s, I believe).  Flora decides to go to the most interesting set of relatives - the Starkadder cousins on Cold Comfort Farm.  The family are portrayed as hillbillies in the worst sense, completely wedded to tradition, dirty and ignorant, unwilling to reform (such as using a dishmop instead of twigs).  [Warning:  this depiction of British farmers of the 1930s may be offensive to some].Flora arrives at Cold Comfort Farm to discover that the farm and the family are apparently cursed.  The family seems to feel that it owes something to her as Robert Poste's child (this is never explained in the film) but her cousins deeply resent her.  The cousins are Amos and Judith Starkadder (cousins who married), their sons Reuben and Seth (the latter a lusty young man who loves the talkies), and several others.  Gradually, Flora changes the way in which her Starkadder cousins live (by cleaning up the house, beginning with her bedroom curtains), persuades nearly each member of the family to make some critical changes, and also brings about three marriages in the future.  All this, while also dangling along a London-based ""embryo parson"" with his own airplane and a locally-based ""writer"" who fancies himself in love with her.Quick summary:  The film was entertaining as long as it is not taken seriously.  There was an element of snobbery in the relations between the city people and the country people that I did not quite like (even if it is true of this period and of today).  The depiction of the gulf between the ""county"" families and the farmers is hinted at, but made light of.  However, there is enough interest sustained in the movie, aided with strong acting from Kate Beckinsale (Flora Poste), Sir Ian McKellan (Amos Starkadder), Eileen Atkins (Judith Starkadder), and Rufus Sewell (Seth Starkadder) that carries the viewer along.  Recommended for lovers of Jane Austen, or for lovers of eccentric British films.  Some crudity but not as much as in WITHNAIL AND I or the BLACKADDER series.",Cold Comfort Farm VHS

The meteor starts to spawn all sorts of weird alien life forcing the inept duo who discovered it to save the world.My Opinion: The trailer made this movie look pretty cool with its excellent special effects and awesome aliens. But it hid the fact that this is a farce comedy. All the special effects and cool aliens are just the backdrop for the slapstick and gross out humor that makes up the core of this movie. David Duchovny and Orlando Jones play stooge like college teachers. They team up with a klutzy fireman want to be  Seann William Scott. Together these three take every scrap of seriousness out of this movie.

484207,"Despite the film's flaws, I found it visually stunning.  The opening sequence with the dead Santa Clauses from an aerial view is orignial; and the film then rewinds in flashback.  The snow-filled scenes of December are well-shot.  Ben Affleck as Rudy Duncan is a well scrubbed prisoner who seems neither worldly nor criminal.  When he tells Ashley, ""I had better sex in prison,"" one sees neither the experience nor the emotional scars.  I saw the film in theatrical release and was firmly convinced that the movie starred Ashley Judd.  I was about 45 minutes into the picture when I said to my wife, ""That's not Ashley Judd; that's the woman from 'Sweet November.'""  Charlize Theron is beautiful.  Her ability to deceive only comes clear as the plot unfolds; we don't really sense the a deep mysterious layer; so it doesn't all hang together, for me.  But I loved the moment when Rudy is on his knees in the snow, about to be shot, and he tells her how Nick (prison mate) loved her.  She looks at him knowingly and says something like, ""Who wouldn't?""  It's at that moment that we can hate her.  The problem, of course, is who do we like?  James Frain as Nick is sensitive and seems also out-of-place in the prison, plus hard to believe in the ending.  It was nice to see Mod Squad's tv show Clarence Williams III as a bank robber.  Gary Sinise was good as the bumbling villain.  Dennis Farina as Jack Bangs the casino owner has great moments laying bloodied on the table keeps repeating, ""I can't go back to Vegas.""  The fact that he's been beaten, laying on a table at gunpoint, and still worried about his job security is humorous at an unlikely moment.  Ehren Kruger's script is so full of plot twists and turns that it is like a roller coaster ride in that you're never sure what's coming next; however, the roller coaster does seem to get off track a bit.  While not classic, this is visually well shot with great pacing.  Enjoy!",Reindeer Games VHS

The perpertrators are so bland and typical that I was thinking of the thugs in ""Home Alone"" trying to be serious.  Did not recognize Dwight Yokum.

The movie is engrossing, very well acted, and even haunting...but is it among the best of all time? Probably not.The main thrust of the is that insecure people do a lot of dumb things if they cannot find love (a hint: everybody in this story is insecure). Maybe all the characters should have followed Sigorney Weaver's character's advice to Christina Ricci's character and gone off into the desert. They all act (adults and teens) like adolescents.Perhaps there is a broader lesson to be drawn from this very well done picture: When the foundations of sand that we--as a society--build for ourselves crumble, those without a more lasting foundation are bound to suffer. The folks in this movie sure do.All in all, ""The Ice Storm"" is a very watchable, intriguing film. A film just like it (American Beauty) deserved the Oscar it won. Maybe ""The Ice Storm"" deserved one too. I recommend this movie highly.",Ice Storm VHS

143737,"I was like her once.... Maybe that's why this movie is so heartbreaking for me to watch. Its whole buildup to the inevitable climax at the Bates High School prom is so expertly constructed out of plot devices, stellar character development, and amazing visual style that we are helplessly swept out to sea by the undertow of our love for the title character. Carrie White (flawless Sissy Spacek) is so wonderfully innocent and remarkably performed that we have no choice in the matter. We are like her prom date at first: Sort of iffy, but then we can't help but adore her. And we can't help but empathize with her because of this grotesque life that she is forced to lead by her pamphlet-pushing religious radical of a mother (the outstanding Piper Laurie). The scenes between the mother and daughter in this film are the key to its satirical elements, as well as giving us a crucial understanding of Carrie's mind. We know why she's so shy, so emotionally distraught, because we would be too in her situation. The very first scene between Spacek and Laurie is a virtuoso, not so much of acting as being the characters, embodying them so fully that all traces of the actresses disappear. They are the key to the entire film; that and Brian Depalma's incredible visuals, which inject every last bit of fear into our veins. Depalma comments on one of the DVD documentaries that he had more time to toy with the visuals in ""Carrie"" than in any other movie he made. It shows. His POV and incredibly detailed crane shots are why certain scenes work at all. By seeing what these characters see, it becomes easier to understand why they act the way they do. Some people might criticize for the excessive use of slow motion, calling it overkill, but it does volumes for the buildup to the climax, which is so powerful with its harsh, constant musical undertone that I dare call it one of the best, most disquieting scenes ever filmed. As Carrie's dark and ruthless use of her telekinetic powers practically rules her body as she wreaks havoc, if not for the sounds of the film itself, you could hear a pindrop every time I've watched the film with company.The film begins with Carrie in the far corner of the screen, awaiting a volleyball toss that she will miss, provoking insults from the girls in her gym class. Then we are shown the locker room in what would have been an exploitation shot if not for the fact that the music and slow motion camerawork make it seem so beautiful. But we are also put on our guard because of this shot, which shows full frontal nudity; frowned upon in most corners of cinema. However it makes one thing clear: This is a director who will do anything. All the ""Halloween"" cliches are not to be found here. There are no cheap shocks. Everything is crafted with only the purpose of building tension, from the blood cascading down Carrie's leg in the shower to one of the single best crane shots I've ever seen, where our fears are allowed to build and build to the breaking point, only to have them build some more before the final purge. The parallel stories of a revenge plot and Carrie's being asked to the prom by the most popular guy in school take the film along at the exact pace it needs, and the intercut scenes with Carrie and her mother supply the emotional center for the film, which rests with our love for Carrie: A character so sweet and unassuming that the slow motion approach to the stage brings a smile to our faces too, even though we are terrified of what awaits her. Therein lies the power of the film. The more we love Carrie, the more we hate her antagonists and feel hurt that they would be so cruel.""Carrie"" is quite possibly the single most dramatically sound horror film ever made. It maps out its characters so vividly and realistically that we never question anyone's actions. There's none of those traditional ""She's so stupid!"" remarks you hear in so many a horror film audience. ""Carrie"" is the real deal. A film that builds an entire house made out of brittle cards of terror, stacking it up until it falls and our fears are realized. There are no scenes of ridiculous scares or people jumping out of the closets to scare their buddies. Depalma recognizes these kind of devices for what they are: Useless. His film is a superb example of how many ways a story can go right, and it is a masterpiece that I am proud to place very high on my list of favorite films.",N/A

520726,"I am not usually a fan of expanded, so-called Director's Cuts of popular movies; usually, they are nothing more than inserted scenes designed to differentiate the film sufficiently enough to garner additional sales from loyal fans.THE LORD OF THE RINGS - THE FELLOWSHIP OF THE RING (PLATINUM SERIES EXTENDED EDITION) is a worthy exception in that the additional 30 or so minutes of footage truly augments and enhances the story.  While I have been a long-time devoted fan of LOTR, I found that the theatrical version, despite some omissions and deviations from the book, was an absolutely marvelous work.  The extended edition is, in my opinion, even better, particularly in the beginning.  The new &quot;shire&quot; opening provides a deeper glimpse into the magical world of the Hobbits and gives the viewer, particularly those who have not read the books, a better understanding of the characters as they develop throughout the movie.  While other scenes are brief, they provide just the extra touch needed to clarify a plot twist or character later in the story.A pleasant surprise is the addition of poetry and song snippets which were such a nice part of the books.  They are not just inserted gratuitously, but rather bring just a touch of additional insight as to the various characters and their unique charms.The quality of the four disc set is very good, although the length and additional features require that the movie be contained on two discs.  The first disc ends rather abruptly (as if someone just turned off the switch rather than a more graceful scene ending fade), however the separation was unavoidable given the limited capacity of the DVD discs, especially with the addition of the various commentaries which can be accessed along with the movie.I have not had the time to fully view the various appendices on discs three and four, however what I have watched to date has been most enjoyable.

That aspect, however, was never among the reasons to see ""Starman"". What makes it worthwhile are it quirky, touching love story, its gentle humor, and Jeff Bridges extraordinary performance as the alien, for which he received an Oscar nomination. Here, he proved himself to be among the great physical actors of his generation. Even if the story itself were not so strong, it would be worth watching the movie simply to see Bridges.Starman comes to visit our planet after we launch a satellite that broadcasts an `invitation' to any intelligent life that might be out there. As you might expect, though, when he gets here, the first thing our military does is to shoot him down. After bailing out, he makes his way to the isolated home of Jenny Hayden [Karen Allen], the widow. While she is sleeping, he looks around the house and finds some home movies and a photo album. This is how he finds and assumes the shape off her husband [we never see Starman's real shape]. His actions awaken her, and she has a shocked first encounter with this apparition. As military helicopters approach, Starman has no choice but to commandeer Jenny and her car for a mad dash across the country to Arizona, where he has one chance to rendezvous with a rescue ship from home.

The plot is clear and consistent. Katie Carr is stunning as Marion. It's not too Disneyfied and sugary, though there is just a touch of that. There is also something you seldom find in movies - a good villain. By that I mean a villain who is not a comic-book bad-guy, but a fully believable and real person who is devious, selfish, ruthless, and always distorting the truth, yet manages to be almost likeable in his own way.

I was kind of expecting one of those stupid special-effects focused horror movies that would be pretty retarded overall, but this turned out to be an exceptionally creepy movie.  There were virtually no amazing visual effects in it, because they weren't neccessary fot the movie.  Based on the old gothic horror story ""The Turn of the Screw"" by Henry James, the movie is about a mother of two children who hires some new servants at her mansion, and the children begin to see strange, eerie things that are made creepy not by what you see but by what you simply hear.  The simple sounds of footsteps thumping upstairs and the sillhouettes of small children at night make the film very genuinely freaky, and this movie is built more on psychological horror than anything else.  Overall, this movie is very good (especially if you watch it in the dark, like any horror movie), and I highly recommend it.",The Others

587726,"If you're selfish and self-absorbed (but don't know it), you'll probably love this colorful film about a single mother's 25-year climb to the best-seller list.  If not, you'll probably just shake your head.  The problem with ""Riding in Cars with Boys"" isn't that it lacks charm or humor; the problem is that it suggests that charm and humor in a person should supplant good judgment, character and sensitivity--even when that person is responsible for someone else.  Drew Barrymore gives her standard perky performance as Beverly Donofrio, a headstrong girl who defies her blue-collar parents (James Woods and Lorraine Bracco in interesting bits) and quickly finds herself pregnant.  Opting for marriage to a soon-to-be-junky loser (played effectively by Steve Zahn), Bev struggles to get to college but not before developing an angry Martyr Complex about her son and dabbling in the drug trade.  The movie's flashback scenes between the now successful Bev and the brash young woman she once was are at times effective--she actually seems a bit smarter and more sensitive in her youth--but too often we're supposed to chuckle at her poor decisions rather than hold her responsible for them.  In fact, the film seems to dodge the tougher question of why we should care about Bev in the first place, as she simply drifts from one crisis to the next, especially when her now-grown son points out all of the psychological trauma being her son has caused.  I guess it's supposed to be all that nostalgic music and Bev's pluck or maybe that she's a single parent.  It's nice that things work out for her in the end--the film is apparently based on an autobiography--but viewers may be left with little sense that the character deserves success so much as fell into it.

Voyerism, wit and suspense are all well played and along with Jimmy's great performance, there is the amazing Grace Kelly and Ramond Burr as the surly neighbour who may, or may not have killed his wife. Franz Waxman's musical score adds a tense layer of gripping suspense, with one of the scores where the music is the 5th character. Everything about the film is brilliant.

I knew they departed from LMM's books, but I was shocked to find out how much.  The story is loosely based on the last book in the Anne series, ""Rilla of Ingleside"", about Anne's youngest daughter during the First World War.  Being the only North American woman's written account of the war, it is a very famous book, and although fiction, has historical value.  In the book Anne & Gibert are middle-aged and the book centers around their young adult children, but the movie has Anne searching for Gilbert on the battle lines!  Of course Anne has a flirtation along the way even though she and Gilbert are married.  What were LMM's descendants thinking when they allowed this movie to be made!?The first two movies are splendid and are true to LMM's characters in ways that the third movie is not.  Although poetic license was used, especially in the 1st sequel, they went a bit further in this second sequel.  Anne didn't seem like Anne.  Gilbert and Diana were so thin they were almost unrecognizable.  How different was Megan Follows as Anne?  One of my friends commented to me that she had seen the movie and actually was under the impression that the actor who played Anne was not Megan Follows!!I think the most unforgiveable thing to me is how they portrayed Anne & Gilbert's wedding, which was so beautiful in the book ""Anne's House of Dreams""!My hope is that if Sullivan productions tackles such a project again that they present ""Anne's House of Dreams"", a wonderful story, and stick to the words that made LMM famous!

357224,"This has always been one of my favorite movies of all time and I have been waiting for a quality DVD Edition to come out, hopefully with some missing scenes.  The DVD looks and sounds absolutely great;  no complaints about the transfer.  A second disc loaded with extras, including about 30 minutes worth of behind the scenes interviews and the like, also adds to the overall value.  My biggest disappointment is with the so-called 'directors cut' edition of the film.  As far as I can tell, there is roughly four minutes worth of additional scenes added to the movie and off the top of my head, this amounts to four scenes of mixed quality in terms of moving the story along (in particular, a mercifully short scene with Doc Holiday's inebriated solo ranting on the night Morgan and Virgil are shot does absolutely nothing to move along the story and it is obvious why this was cut from the theatrical release).  There are a couple of good scenes added, both of which explain further the demise of the relationship between Wyatt and his wife as well as Doc and Kate the Prostitute.  Here is what really, really bugs me;  when you watch the trailers or commercials for this movie (and the second disk is loaded with them), you can see plain as day that there are at least three other scenes which were shot in some form that are of some interest that never ever made it to this director's cut!  Check it out on the trailers and note:  Kurt Russell and Dana Delaney getting passionate in the woods, Doc helping Wyatt up from the river following the gunfight with Curly Bill and his gang, and Jason Priestley nervously pulling a rifle on somebody.  Where were these scenes on this disk?  All in all, the movie is a must have on DVD and the quality of the transfer as well as the movie itself rates very, very highly.  I just feel somewhat 'had' over the lack of these scenes, which I myself was looking forward to finally seeing.",N/A

Prospero's Books matches the former for the rich tapestry that is presented on the screen.  The story, however, from the Shakespeare play &quot;The Tempest&quot;, is complex, difficult to follow, and over the top.  This isn't a turnoff, however, as I have found that I have continued to gain understanding about the story each time I watch this movie.  This movie mixes multiple levels of reality and dream simultaneously, making your first viewing confusing, but each additional viewing a treat for the mind, in addition to the eyes.

520581,"I don't usually review movies but I have to pay tribute to Peter Jackson's impressive film version of LOTR.  Jackson and his team have exercised unusual talent and intelligence in bringing LOTR to the screen.  Jackson and his co-writers made a number of changes in the plot, mainly deleting some subplots and minor characters.  These choices were made very well, not sacrificing any of the dramatic integrity of the story, and are really necessary for keeping a movie, even a 3 part film with long individual components, within reasonable commerical bounds.  Jackson's team is remarkably faithful to Tolkien's vision; their realization of many of the most important setpieces within the books is remarkable.  Most important of all, Jackson and his team have really been faithful to Tolkien's moral vision.  LOTR is a story about the virtues of courage and decency, and the need to and costs of resisting evil.  The LOTR films, with excellent performances from the entire cast, capture this very well.  Jackson has done a particularly good job of making the Ring of Power itself a protagonist in the film.  This insidious source of evil and corruption is the real villain of the piece.  Tolkien's opposition of the pull of the Ring against Frodo's quiet moral courage is tremendous moral drama which Jackson has brought to the fore of his movies.",The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring
600976,"Perfect summer entertainment, except not as cheesy as most summer films. I had a great time with Blue Crush. It entertained and amazed the hell out of me. I was in awe of the incredible surfing sequences. We are taken right into the waves and feel as if we are actually there. Very well done cinematography. The surfing scenes couldn't get more perfect.Now the thing I've heard most complain about is the plot in between the amazing surfing scenes. And you know what? It really was not as bad as everyone was saying, in fact, I didn't think it was bad at all. I'll admit it was a little loose, but that's because the movie isn't really about the plot. It was less talk and more action and that was great, it doesn't give the viewer a chance to be bored. I thought they did a really good job with the actual story that was there. I never once found the diologue snicker worthy. Sure it's not Oscar material, but I have heard some really bad diologue in teen flicks (She's All That, Summer Catch) and the diologue in this movie doesn't come close to that.I also liked the romance. It wasn't that original yet it was interesting and never bored me. Plus I like how it didn't make up the entire movie and never delayed the ...surfing scenes, we spend a lot of time in the water. The realistic ending was also nice, if not a little disappointing at first. It doesn't end how most will expect it to end, which isn't a bad thing. That made it less predictable and I've got to give it props for that. Now I don't want anyone to take what I said the wrong way and expect a bad ending, it's not a bad ending that will leave you [angry] while walking out of the theater. So don't worry, it does end on a high note and have a happy ending, it's just a different happy ending than we thought.I think the diologue is getting unfairly bashed. Remember The Fast And The Furious? I thought that was a very fun movie, even if the diologue was cheesy. That movie was about the fast cars, not the plot. And although I knew it wasn't the best writing or plot it never bothered me once. I just sat back and enjoyed what was a very fun summer movie. And I can tell you for certain that the diologue here is not even close to as bad as it was in The Fast And The Furious. In that movie it was noticeable, in BLUE CRUSH I didn't notice at all. Maybe it's because the actors were able to pull it off with flying colors, or maybe it actually wasn't that bad. But whatever it was I didn't notice. The actors all did well with their parts, especially Bosworth. I can't wait to see her in more movies, like the upcoming RULES OF ATTRACTION. She's a star in the making.Overall, BLUE CRUSH is an excellent summer movie that should be experienced at the cinema. The excellent cinematography just won't be the same on video. Trust me, see it on the big screen. It's not the most original movie, but most movies aren't anymore. Everything has already been done in one way or another. I had a great time watching it. It's the only movie I've seen at the theater this summer and it was definitely a good choice.Grade: 8/10",Blue Crush

543475,"""Rush Hour 2"" is a highly enjoyable follow-up to the original 1998 box office smash.  Like the previous film, this first of what will undoubtedly be a long line of lucrative sequels combines sardonic humor with eye-popping martial arts action sequences to entertaining effect.  Chris Tucker and Jackie Chan repeat their roles as unlikely cop buddies, starting off the film in Chan's home territory, Hong Kong, and finishing up in Tucker's, the good ole US of A.Chan, with his sheepish deadpan delivery, makes a perfect straight man for Tucker's fast-talking bad brotha wiseacre, whose mouth engages in more heavy-duty action than Chan's karate-chopping hands and feet.  Much of the humor is generated by Tucker's ability to seem totally unflustered by any peril that happens to come his way, managing to sass talk his way out of one dangerous predicament after another.  Moreover, Chan's ability to create humor out of perfectly choreographed stunt sequences puts him right up there with some of the silent comedy greats like Chaplin and Keaton.  The split-second perfection of these scenes, combined with the balletic grace with which they are executed, makes him one of the truly unique talents working in movies today.  Luckily, in his move to mainstream American filmmaking, Chan has been able to find behind-the-scenes talent good enough to match his own.  The screenplay by Jeff Nathanson, though no world-beater when it comes to originality or depth, does posses a playful spirit that works well in the context of the genre.  Likewise, director Brett Ratner keeps the action percolating along at a lively, often dizzying clip.As with most Chan films, however, ""Rush Hour 2"" seems to go on for about a half hour too long - even though its running time barely clocks in at a very short 90 minutes.  Perhaps this type of material really can't be sustained much beyond an hour before the repetitiousness of it begins to take its toll.  However, that is certainly a minor quibble about a film that, for the most part, provides plenty of laughs, some kick-... performances and action sequences that, as per usual for a Chan film, will, quite literally, make your jaw drop.  .",N/A

701117,"There was a few David Fencher fans anxiously awaiting the arrival of ~Panic Room~. After the disappointment of 'The Game', we somehow knew that this interesting director would indeed attempt to out due himself, or at least show us that his casting director(s), after the dismal mistake with Michael Douglas, could redeem themselves. Let's face it, with a resume like Jodi Foster, its hard to go wrong, and this certainly was proved in ~Panic Room~. She puts in a grand performance that we've come to expect.This film grabs you from the start - the opening credits are original and quite impressive - so much so, they're worth the price of admission alone. In fact, call me strange, but I wanted to sneak back into the theatre during the second showing to see them again.The camera work is pure art. The planning for each shot shows an attention to detail and seamless quality that does not detract from the viewing. Confined to such a small space over months of shooting, every scene is painstakingly crafted; the editing is tight, which only adds to the suspense.The plot is almost laughably simple, but an excellent scenario in which to get actors and crew to surpass their limits as artists. Fencher surely achieved this end, because everything but the plot itself is superlative. During the first ten minutes of viewing, I kept thinking: in terms of style what does this film remind me of? Hitchcock came to mind. ~Panic Room~ has a 'Vertigo' and 'Rope' feel to it without question. For me, at any rate, this only added to the film's enjoyment.David Fencher set a new standard with his masterpiece, 'Seven' (another work of art in editing that won an Oscar nomination), which deserved all the acolades it received. But, unfortunately, ~Panic Room~ doesn't quite set a new standard, but more a thriller piece that should please moviegoers interested in this genre of film.A suggestion, do not wait for this film to come out on DVD or video, because it's made for the big screen.

579928,"The Diary of a Chambermaid is Luis Brunuel's masterpiece. Though it satirizes countless aspects of French society during the years leading up to WWII (1930, to be precise), includes several intriguing character studies, and carries off a complex plot, it still manages to captivate.  Though there is an obvious political statement about fascism, Brunuel seems to have been more intent on showcasing the complacent attitudes of the bourgeoisie that allowed Europe to crumble into the throes of war.Jeanne Moreau is Celestine, a beautiful Parisian chambermaid to moves to the Normandy countryside to work in the home of the wealthy Monteil family.  The cast of characters she discovers there are laughable.  The family patriarch, Monsieur Rabour, has a foot fetish (with which Celestine has no choice but to comply); his daughter is a frigid woman who cares about nothing more than her imported goodies (and her unvaluables too:  she counts sugar cubes to make sure the staff hasn't been stealing); her husband is an amourous fiend who seeks moments of ""amour fou"" (mad love) with Celestine.  Even Celestine's fellow servant-types have their quirks, except not so funny.  Joseph, the groundskeeper, is a ruthless racist and sadist who denounces ""kikes and wops,"" tortures animals and rapes and murders a child of whom Celestine was fond.  All the while, he is active in a right-winged Facist movement to rid France of foreigners and destroy the republic.It is the murder of young Claire, and her desire to see justice done, that keeps Celestine at the Monteil estate after her master dies (clutching a pair of shoes, no less).  She quickly focuses on Joseph.  She accuses him directly but fails to get a confession--though he didn't deny the act, either.  There's only one problem:  Celestine is forced to fight a sexual attraction to Joseph.  In the end, she uses sex as her last shot at extracting a confession.This film does not end with justice; nor does Celestine remain a character of moral fiber.  In the film's last scene, with Celestine having just proven herself to be the ultimate opportunist, the countrymen are marching through the streets toward right-wing brutality and fascism.From beginning to end, The Diary of a Chambermaid is an amusing look at everything Luis Brunuel apparently hated:  the bourgeoisie, complacency, fascism, Catholic (pay attention to the scene in which Madame Monteil asks the priest how to cope with her husband's advances), and the goverment.  This isn't knee-slapping funny, but a small slice of wisdom served up in black and white.",Diary of a Chambermaid

129526,"This 1984 sequel to the 1981 classic &quot;Raiders Of The Lost Ark&quot;, is a real important film to me. I saw it 11 times in the theaters and I was mesmerized. I hadn't seen anything like it before. It's one of those films that brings back great memories from your youth. Spielberg, Lucas, and Ford all return for this chapter. It takes place 10 years later, and Indy is joined by a nightclub singer, Willie Scott(Kate Capshaw), and a young sidekick named Short Round(Ke Huy - Quan from &quot;The Goonies&quot;), on a mission to find and rescue young children who have been kidnapped from a small village by some sort of cult. Indy and his gang infiltrate this incredible palace, only to discover the horror that lurks below the place. This film definitley has the Saturday morning serial cliffhanger thing going here. More so than the first and third installments. This movie is a little darker and more violent than &quot;Raiders&quot;. Some fans didn't think that was such a good thing. Their loss. This movie is a rollercoaster ride from beginning to end. It's a movie that never stops being entertaining. There are a number of classic scenes in here, like - The mine cart chase, the airplane scene, the water out the side of the mountain, the rope bridge. You know it's a good movie when you can think of a number of good scenes like that. Once again, Spielberg has a nice eye for details. Ford is the most charismatic hero of the century. No one comes close. Capshaw and Quan are on hand mostly for comedic support.

361236,"I think that ""Bleu"" has failed in what most more or less watchable films made in the 90s have failed. While it is beautifully shot, has a good casting, an appropriate musical score, and a number of highly original (and therefore interesting) scenes (where the use of music, the use of silence is very effective), on the whole it is rather pointless and thus boring. While watching it, I could not understand why it should have been called ""Bleu"". This story about a woman who survives a tragedy and has to struggle with her past (and present) is at times very delicate and realistic - and these scenes do come up in my mind from time to time - but it is shown in a way too limited in scope; the film on the whole does not remain in your mind for long, it lacks some strength, some backbone. I tried watching it the second time but it proved to be too boring to bear. I, nevertheless, would recommend everyone to see and think about ""Bleu"" by himself.",N/A
684550,"This new show from the creator of Project Ako is not a disapointment. It manages to bring light-hearted comedy to the screen as well as some fleshy scenes that might be appealing to some viewers who may feel animation belongs only in the realm of children.As I stated there are a few adult overtones in the show but these are laced with extreme insanity which, though it often does not work in a live action format, often does wonders for an animated feature. There are no direct nudity scenes in the show itself though the end credits leave little to the imagination.The voice tracks seem in some ways to be coming from different directions. The Japanese voice track does not seem to flow as easily as the English especially in the comedic scenes. The Japanese actors seem almost to be struggling with their characters but this might be expected. The original idea for the show was that of a samurai show after all. The English track was recorded long after the idea for the show was switched to comedy so the idea the English actors had was different from that given their Japanese counter-parts.Compared to other shows such as Love Hina the flare with which the characters tackle their environment may seem old fashioned but it is sure to appeal to anyone who likes comedy in anime.

588884,"This is not a perfect movie by any means. But Will Smith is brilliant as Ali, particularly during the early part of the film, where he superbly portrays the boxer in his young Cassius Clay days. I remember those years when Cassius Clay came to prominence, and Smith captures his spirit, his cheekiness, his strength, and his sheer, confident youth to a tee. As Clay grows as a boxer and as a man, embraces the Muslim faith, and becomes Muhammad Ali, he changes more than his religion and name. The cockiness is still there, but so is the cynicism and disappointment brought on by too much fame, too much money, too many women, too many hangers-on. Smith handles the change from brash youth to more thoughtful man with subtlety and aplomb.The disappointing part of the film, which begins to drag on and on, is the lack of depth in Ali's relationships. His marriages are glossed over quickly...we get no sense of what he is really thinking, or what his private life is really like. The same holds true of his relationships with his entourage, from his manager on down. If this was meant to come across as aloofness, it didn't work; this viewer found it very frustrating.Nevertheless, the movie is worth seeing, for the sheer exuberance of Smith's acting, and the absolutely dead-on portrayal of the late sportscaster Howard Cosell, rendered fabulously by Jon Voight. It is not a brilliant movie, but in my view, it deserves more than 3 stars. I think it is inexplicably under-rated.",Ali

The movie portrays the coming of age, sexual freedom and wayward view of the young adults of the 60's, the almost plastic existence of their future.  Dustin Hoffman stars as Benjamin and it is his breakout role.  He was thirty years old when he filmed the picture, but he perfectly captures the youthful, nave essence of the part.  Anne Bancroft vamps it up as Mrs. Robinson who seduces Benjamin.  Ms. Bancroft brings a sexy and sultry flair to the film and her role as a sexual predator was stunning at the time.  A third star of the film is the soundtrack by Simon & Garfunkel.  Their music is liberally intertwine throughout the film, the opening sequence set to ""The Sounds Of Silence"" is dead on and the use ""Scarborough Fair/Canticle"" adds a longing, somber note to the picture.  Of course the movie produced the number one hit ""Mrs. Robinson"" which won a Grammy as Record of the Year in 1968.  The film was just the second that Mike Nichols directed.  His first was Whose Afraid of Virginia Woolf, which was departure from his comedic background.

Yet another seemingly tacked-on ending.There were a couple of inspired scenes which appealed to my warped sensibilities: Dafoe and Furlong having a conversation via toilet during their placement in solitary confinement; and the tasteful scene where Dafoe slits his wrists, sprays blood all over himself and eats his own doodoo.

Three of the five shorts on this entry are among the teams' best, ""Three Little Beers"" (1935), ""Three Arabian Nuts"" (1951) and the underrated ""Three Smart Saps"" (1942).  However, I'm only awarding 2 stars due to:- Only 5 shorts on this disc?  Past volumes have included 6 (one with 7), and considering the information capacity of DVD, even more Stooge classics could easily fit.  I'm hoping this was a one-time-only shortchanging, and future volumes will provide more for the money.- Where's the quality control!!!  The print of ""Three Little Beers"" has 20 missing seconds due to a sloppy splice!  One of the funniest scenes in the short (Curly dropping a plethora of golf balls from his pockets) is GONE!I want to continue supporting Columbia's Stooge DVDs, but you will have to do better than this one guys.",N/A

At first I was a little skeptical since Malkovich isn't exactly the prototype big, strong guy I envisioned in the role of Lenny.  Gary Sinise was perfect for the cynical and smug role of George, but I was pleasantly surprised by Malkovich - where was the Oscar nod?Having read the book twice and thoroughly enjoyed it, the movie was hardly a disappointment as most movies based on classics turn out to be(Exhibit A:Mel Gibson's Hamlet).  In fact, Sinise's directorial effort coupled with the genius of Malkovich makes this one movie that seemingly tops the book.  And that's high praise.  Kudos.",Of Mice & Men VHS
428650,"Ray Barrett and wife Jennifer Daniels inherit his brother's Cornish cottage, after the brother's unusual demise by the mysterious ""Black Death.""  The locals aren't too friendly, especially austere neighbor Noel Willman, a reclusive gentleman famous for writing about obscure religious cults around the world.  Willman's lovely daughter, the inexplicably shy and subdued Jacqueline Pearce, is as friendly to Barrett and his wife as her father is hostile, and inadvertently engages them in what rapidly becomes an ugly murder plot  -  the same one that claimed Barrett's late brother.This is one of Hammer's better low-budgeters, which suffers from a few flaws:  it's slow moving and a bit padded; the music (as in many films from the same studio in the same period) is overly melodramatic; and the suspense is half-shot from the opening teaser, by explicitly showing precisely the mystery Barrett and Daniels are attempting to solve (though not quite all of its details).  It plays like a turn-of-the-century supernatural murder mystery, which is essentially what it is.However, it's splendidly acted by all involved, especially Willman and Pearce, who suffer from a guilty secret and a resultant family curse beyond their ability to explain to outsiders.  The sets and props are gorgeous, the scenery beautiful, the atmosphere heavy.  Pearce's makeup is magnificent, even if the papier-mache shows  -  it's a truly striking effect, and properly underused.  There are some very creepy and highly memorable scenes, most notably the finale and one in which Pearce  -  in a genuinely unspeakable condition  -  writhes around on her bed while an insidious Malaysian manservant chants over her body.Anyone enjoying this film should also check out Plague of the Zombies, made by the same production team and many of the same cast members.",Reptile VHS

Even with such an impressive list of movies, ""Passenger 57"" is by far his best work.Snipes plays John Cutter, an ex-cop / terrorism expert, with a rather large chip on his shoulder.

679509,"Jeepers Creepers (Victor Salva, 2001)I think that, with the arguable exception of Battlefield Earth, I haven't heard so much negative press about a movie in the past decade as I did about  this one. No idea why. This is one of the better horror movies to come out of Hollywood in quite a while, and Victor Salva has finally lived up to the promise that's kept Hollywood allowing him to make bad movies on a fairly  regular basis for the past decade and a half.The story opens with a brother and sister team, Derry (Justin Long, from the TV series Ed) and Trish (Gina Phillips, who recently had a turn on Boston  Public and shows up next year in The Anarchist's Cookbook), driving across the state on their way home from college for spring break. On a secluded stretch of highway, a strange truck menaces them before roaring past. A few miles  down the road, they see the truck's driver dumping something that looks suspiciously like a body wrapped in a sheet down a large pipe, and after he drives away they stop to investigate. Complications ensue.The movie's probably not going to win any awards for its acting, writing, or cinematography, all of which fall into the slightly-above-average category.  But then, this isn't a movie with Oscar aspirations anyway. It's supposed to be a fast-paced slick little horror film, and that's what it is. Salva achieves the right balance between showing the nastiness and cutting away to let  suggestion do the work, and also uses the suggestion technique with his bad guy most of the time (something that hasn't been seen too much in films for a while). Add in a Miss Cleo-esque psychic (Patricia Belcher), a few hick cops who  actually break stereotype a few times, and a fun bad guy (Jonathan Breck, from the painfully bad film Spiders), and you've got a fine little flick. *** ",Jeepers Creepers
469104,"The play is there, or most of it. It is funny and light, though a little bit too spectacular. Shakespeare requires and deserves some simplicity in the special effects to make the text more effective. The magic of the play is nevertheless with us : imbroglios, funny sexual innuendo, puns, etc. And of course the end is the triple wedding ceremony with a fourth one (Titania and Oberon) behind and a fifth one that gives a tragic vision of what happens when parents or social circumstances refuse love and impose fake weddings : this leads to death and it is the play in the play that is made funny by the inability of the amateur actors to perform tragedy and also by their creativity in having a wall played by a man and the moon replaced by a lantern held by the man in the moon, or even by ythe replacement of a roaring lion by a barking and biting poodle. Yet I am afraid that the transposition of the play into the finishing 19th century is kind of naive and also adds too many gadgets of the  modern  world, especially bikes. The result is too anecdotic and the humor is no longer on the situation among the young people, but too much in the use, abuse and misuse of these bikes. It also makes the dilemma of getting married with the man chosen by the father or getting executed or becoming a nun kind of silly and out of place because mostly impossible at the end of the 19th century. What's more the two couples of young people are supposed to be sixteen or seventeen in the play, children in a way, and they are obviously adults, too old for the part, too old to be that naive and fresh. Finally I am afraid that turning Puck into an old man is not a very good idea. He has to be inexperienced and innocently sloppy in his work, hence he has to be a very young fairy.

4948,"Director Steven Spielberg's classic 1977 follow-up to &quot;Jaws,&quot; &quot;Close Encounters of the Third Kind&quot; stars Richard Dreyfuss as Roy Neary.  Neary's just an ordinary blue collar guy, a bit of a dreamer with a taste for Disney films and miniature railroads... until he witnesses a spectacular UFO appearance.  Haunted by mental images of a mountain he's never seen before, Neary risks his job, his marriage, his sanity and, eventually, his life to uncover what it all means.&quot;Close Encounters&quot; also marks the first appearance of the Spielberg formula.  You know, the messy suburban house, the mouthy kids, the whole &quot;just plain folks involved with something magical&quot; storyline.  And while he gets a lot of knocks, both justified and unjustified, for inflicting this on American movies in the 80s, Spielberg's use of documentary-like elements throughout (as the space people play some Burmuda Triangle-related tricks on what's apparently an international investigation team) and some funky casting (Teri Garr, French director Francois Truffaut, Bob Balaban and others) combine to lend this one a veracity some of his later films- and those of his imitators- sometimes lack.  This is a very fresh and original take on sci-fi subject matter, completely without physical violence (although there is some of the emotional kind).  Seeing decades later after so many heartless, bombastic, noise and light CGI fests, one can't help but admire Spielberg's ability to get to the emotional core of this material.Plus, it helps that the cutesy elements are kept to a minimum.  There's Melinda Dillon as a single mom whose oh-so-adorable-with-his-big-eyes kid gets kidnapped by the UFOs; the scene is played for scares, rather than laughs and it is genuinely terrifying.  Neary's kids are mostly unpleasant, and gone after the halfway point.  Dreyfuss downplays Neary's potential drippyness and plays up his frustration and rage as circumstances overwhelm him.  And Garr is very believable as Neary's doubtful wife; she keeps the character from becoming a one-note shrew.  You actually sympathize with her as she deals with what she thinks is her husband's selfish midlife crisis.The film ends with an amazing sequence of events and actually takes on an epic scope without losing the human element that makes it all so enjoyable.  This DVD release follows the format from the recent &quot;Jaws&quot; disk:  a gorgeous widescreen print, a few deleted scenes, some documentaries.

40997,"This is on my top three fantasy movies (the others being ""Conan the Barbarian"" and ""The Lord of the Rings""). The story is very original (about a race of immortals living among us in secrecy), the acting great (especially that of Sean Connery, who absolutely steals the show as the immortal mentor Ramirez), and the sword fighting scenes (though they seem a bit dated) are exciting and well-choreographed. It also features an A+ musical score by Michael Kamen, with some great Queen songs added in.The ""Immortal Edition"" DVD is fairly impressive. The sound and picture quality (especially picture) are kind of disappointing for something ""digitally mastered in THX"", but exceptional. The special features consist mainly of Queen music videos (infact, the second disc is nothing more than a CD with three Queen songs), but the talent bios are surprisingly long and interesting.

The film was one of the first true horror animated films for adults (mind you this came out before AKIRA so AKIRA was not the only great one to come out in the 80s) and it's as good as if it had been made into live action movie. The animation is amazing considering the time period and the screenplay is very layered. It makes a fairly subtle social commentery about social positions in terms of the &quot;common&quot; mixing with pure bloods which gives it an added depth which makes it even more compelling and makes it rise above the average anime film. The characters are all extremely well drawn. You can't help but feel empathy for Lamika, the Count's daughter. It has some great visuals in terms of the design of the demons and mosters and the design of landscapes and castles. The music is also great, very ominous, classical and heartfelt at times. This movie also creates a great anime superhero in D who deservedly had another movie created around him called VAMPIRE HUNTER D: BLOODLUST. Do not miss this movie.

279433,"Every actor or actress who has achieved success in Hollywood tends to have one film that is their ""signature"" part and in Greta Garbo's instance that role would have to be her tragic heroine Marguerite Gautier in the MGM classic ""Camille'.This film was, and is one of the benchmarks for how a classic movie should be put together. Flawless attention to detail, a great romantic story, exquisite performances by all concerned, a sumptous production and a fine literary source. All these elements successively combine here to make a screen masterpiece that has moved, charmed and entertained movie goers for generations. Indeed ""Camille"" is probably the best known and most often revived of all of Greta Garbo's great body of work which includes such masterpieces as , ""Grand Hotel"", ""Mata Hari"", ""Queen Christina"", and ""Ninotchka"".Greta Garbo, the mysterious, and reclusive MGM star here proves yet again what a stunning actress she can be when given material worthy of her talents. Based on the tragic story by Alexandre Dumas of ""The Lady of the Camellias"", ""Camille"" tells the story of Marguerite Gautier a famous 19th Century courtesan in Paris who lives by her beauty and the support of those men who can pay for it. The tragedy of her situation is that when life means very little to her and she finds herself slowly dying of consumption, she meets the love of her life the young and penniless gentlemen Armand who loves her for herself and not because of the charms she can offer. Armand offers her a life of genuine love and purpose which is missing in her gilded Parisian life among her superficial, pleasure loving friends and as the mistress of the grim and domineering Baron de Varville who views her as his personal plaything. Garbo instills in Marguerite just the right qualities of tragedy and humour to make her a well rounded believable character. Her scenes with the Baron have just the right elements of fear and loathing of the situation she finds herself in. Garbo, who earned yet another Oscar nomination for this role,  reached new dramatic heights here and it was a performance which she was justifibly proud of.""Camille"" has a wonderful array of performers who surround Garbo with some stunning work. Robert Taylor was a rising MGM star only just beginning his incredibly long career with the studio when he was handed the plum role of Armand. Previously acted on screen by non other than Rudolph Valentino, Taylor has been accused of a certain stiffness  in his playing. Reportedly he was terrified at the propect of working so closely with the legendary Garbo but it does not show in his performance. Certainly his work in the second half of the film is a major improvement when he experiences the frustrations of loving a woman who is being kept by a wealthy older man. His is a fine performance given the limitations of the role . Henry Daniell, a veteran character actor with many fine performances to his credit does a superb turn as the nasty Baron de Varville. He is excellent in his scenes with Garbo and projects an image of a cruel, self centred individual who regards Marguerite as his personal possession and who believes that money can get him everything he wants in life. The sterling cast also contains some wonderful work from Jessie Ralph another veteran character actress. She takes the sympathetic role of Nanine , Marguerite's devoted maid who stays with her devotedly through all the ups and downs of her life. Perhaps one of the most dazzling performances is turned in by Laura Hope Crews as Marguerite's superficial and self centred friend Prudence. Rarely has Crews, best known nowadays for playing Aunt Pittypat in ""Gone With The Wind"", given a more wonderful performance, she is in turn selfish, amusing, uncaring and infuriating and she dominates her scenes aided by her gaudy jewellery, over the top fashions and commanding presence . Lionel Barrymore also registers in the supporting role of Armand's concerned father Monsieur Duval and his most memorable scene occurs when he confronts Garbo's character with what she is potentially doing to Armand's chances of ever succesively making his way in life. Garbo's anguish at having to reject Armand for his own good despite the love she is feeling for him is heartrenching and gives Marguerite the mantle of a great tragic character. The interplay between Garbo and Barrymore, who had worked together before very effectively in ""Mata Hari"", is brilliant and goes a long way to explaining why these two performers are still considered stars 70 years after this production.Superbly directed by the legendary director George Cukor who worked so beautifully with Garbo on a number of occasions, ""Camille"" literally glows with the essence of a tragic romance in the making. Cukor was expert at extracting just the right amount of pathos and longing for other things from his players and  here he excels in one of his finest films. The production also benefits from MGM's great ability to bring the very best of talents to everything both in front of and behind the scenes. Adrian never surpassed himself than here in the stunning costumes he created for Garbo and the chief supporting players in this production. The film is so gorgeously costumed it makes viewing ""Camille"" a veritable eye feast but they tie in very carefully with what courtesans of that time wore and shows MGM's meticulous research into a time or period. Cedric Gibbon's sets almost rival his stunning work for ""Marie Antoniette"" a year later and have that unmistakably no expense spared MGM look about them.""Camille"" is the ultimate in romantic screen entertainment of the first order. For people wanting to sample Garbo's work for the first time this production is the best choice of all her films. I love it as an example of old style movie making at its very best with all areas of the production given total care and attention. It is a timeless story and for all lovers of romance this film will never fail to move you in its dilemma of searching for real love at the expense of ones creature comforts. I never fail to be impressed by ""Camille"" and you wont regret this trip into another time and place when love and position could mean everything in an individuals life.",N/A

The only person I can half stand in this movie is Sally Field, who I like and respect as an actress, but even her character wears thin.

The most dependable character in this movie for David is this toy bear.  The bear's animation is incredible, that is why this movie even earns 1 star.  However, the bear is almost creepily real and I expected his to turn into an evil Chuckie doll at anytime.

To explain too much is to rob the viewer of the power of the film.Following said 'red violin' through its history, it weaves together many tales in its path through the seeings of a tarot card reader back in the day of the violin's creator.

534830,"Many viewers were blown away by Cast Away, but I was not one of them. Much of the enjoyment of the movie depends on whether or not you are a Tom Hanks fan. I'm not all that impressed by him, and I assume that puts me in the minority. I believe the terms 'actor' and 'star' are not interchangeable. There have always been stars who are also consummate actors; however, one does not need a broad range of acting skills in order to be a star - or, for that matter, to win awards. Hanks is a star of the first magnitude. He can 'open' a picture because his legions of fans are going to flock to anything he is in. He likes to be in different kinds of movies, but, no matter what he is in, I am always aware that I am watching Tom Hanks.This time he plays Chuck Noland, a revved-up, stressed out manager at FedEx. He flies all over the world helping to make the package delivery giant ever more efficient. He is obsessed with time. It is Christmas, and he is about to ask Kelly [Helen Hunt] to marry him. Even this important moment is interrupted when he is called away for yet another flight to solve another company emergency. This time he doesn't make it. The plane crashes in the South Pacific, and Chuck, the only survivor, manages to make it to a deserted island. He is trapped in a place where time becomes irrelevant. Even his watch doesn't work. His survival tools are limited to a motley assortment of FedEx packages that washed ashore with him. Now he must learn whether or not the survival skills he honed in civilization will have any use in a place where civilization has no meaning.The production values are high in Cast Away. The plane crash, for example, is terrifyingly realistic and filled with first-rate special effects. Its the high point of the movie, but I don't think that's what its makers intended. The part where Noland is marooned on the island is well photographed and succeeds in capturing the character's utter aloneness and his descent into madness It is also a very long sequence, running nearly an hour and a half. After a while, there is only so much you can do with a character who has only a soccer ball to talk to. It was so long that it gave me time to think about how I was watching a very rich star doing a good impression of someone trapped on a deserted island. I began to picture Hank's big air-conditioned trailer and the mounds of gourmet food that lurked just out of camera range.Anyone who saw Cast Away's trailer knows whether Noland makes it off the island or not. For those who did not see it, I won't give away the ending. I will say that it is one the oddest and least inspired ones I've seen in a long time.",N/A

It deserves to be made into a film. But besides that, I don't think people realize how much we sorely need a truly good, original fantasy film these days. There have been so many attempts at it, and all have failed. Ron Howard failed with Willow. Rob Reiner failed with The Princess Bride. Steven Spielberg failed with Hook. Ridley Scott failed with Legend. Chris Colombus failed with Harry Potter. Now, finally, where all these filmmakers have failed, director Peter Jackson has succeeded.The Lord of the Rings trilogy is about a group of men, dwarves, elves, and hobbits who try to destroy the One Ring, a magical artifact forged by the dark lord Sauron as a way to channel his power and control Middle-Earth. It is from this simple premise that the film takes off, and what ensues is a very enjoyable, very epic tale.There is something to be said for &quot;using your imagination&quot; to conjure up images while reading a book, but nothing compares to the grand, unbelievably striking images and visuals that fill this adaptation. The direction is nothing short of amazing: the art direction and visual aspect of the film is some of the best I've ever seen. The settings and scenery are vast and you never see the same type of land twice. Valleys, mountains, snowy peaks, caves, forests, riverbeds, it's almost too much to keep track of. The sets are huge and varied, and the massive amount of detail in them reminds me of films like Gladiator. They have a great quality of consistency, as well: the architecture and style of buildings changes as you travel throughout Middle-Earth and enter places inhabited by different cultures. Seeing how each culture has its own style in everything from architecture to weaponry is a sight to behold; it makes this fantasy world real.The story has a soul, and what a soul it is, full of character development and themes of friendship, courage, sacrifice, and unlikely heroes. At its core, it is a study on one thing: power, as represented by the One Ring. Through all the characters and situations we encounter, a new facet of the responsibility of power is shown. Virtually every character in the story has to, at one point, make a decision regarding what they would do with the ring - no one is left unscathed, so to speak. It creates a blanketing, all-encompassing theme, one that isn't merely discussed here and there, but is rather brought up all the time as the story unfolds. The excitement is in watching each character's reaction to the notion of power in the form of that tiny little ring.Elijah Wood stands out as Frodo; his unnaturally large eyes project the innocence of Frodo's character. But the most impressive actors are Ian McKellan and Sean Bean, because of the different dimensions they bring to their roles. McKellan inhabits his role as Gandalf, and it's a wonder that, at one point, Sean Connery was once considered for this part. McKellan is a great actor, and here he not only projects majesty but also makes Gandalf a very human character at the same time, capable of great compassion and temptation as well. Sean Bean rivals this with his portrayal of Boromir, and it is such a crucial role too; he convinces the audience he is a good man, just one with a tragic flaw. It's probably the best performance of the film, and one of the best of the year.Action-wise, the first part of the film is made up of the Black Riders looking for the ring and chasing the hobbits, and it simply does not work. The Riders always, always appear where the hobbits are going. They're an omnipresence, and it ruins any suspense we may feel because we realize there's no point to the film having the hobbits try to hide from them -- they'll pop up anyway. There are also examples of very poor choices made during some of the chases, such as using extensive slow motion during a supposed fast-paced pursuit scene. Why the filmmakers decided on this, I don't know.However, the rest of the film contains much more entertaining and ambitious kinds of action. The prologue contains glimpses of the kind of colossal-scale battles we'll be treated to in the sequels, camera flying over the vast armies to give us a full sense of scale. The other major action sequences are much smaller-scale versions of this, but they work very effectively. The Mines of Moria action sequence is intense and claustrophobic and is the first time we get to see the members of the fellowship fight in battle. The finale is an extended sequence that contains violent, intense action (this is one of the most graphic PG-13 films I've ever seen) and very satisfying emotional thrills, as well, as certain characters reach the heights of their development.Despite some weak action as well as rushed editing and pacing problems in the first half, this is a great movie, a three hour long movie that I honestly felt was two hours long. It is, without a doubt, one of the most gorgeous films ever made. They have created Middle-Earth. Each frame of the movie is like a painting in itself, everything is set up so perfectly yet so naturally in the environments. Even the most mundane shots of a forest or a glade seem so perfect.FOTR is probably the best straight-out fantasy film I've ever had the privilege to see. Like Star Wars, it takes you away to a different world. To see FOTR is to see the heights to which cinematic visual artistry can reach. To see it is to become a living part of Middle-Earth. And we still have two more to go.",The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring
344768,"I am a huge fan of &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot; book by J.R.R. Tolkien and when I stumbled upon this animated film of the first two books of the trilogy, &quot;The Fellowship of the Ring&quot; and &quot;The Two Towers,&quot; I decided to watch it. Was I disappointed with the film? Absolutely not! Was the film perfect? No way. But did I thoroughly enjoy it? I sure did. This animated movie is very true to the books in certain places, but in other places the film is very off. It is a lot of fun to see your favorite characters from the books animated on screen and doing what they are doing.As I stated above, this film is based on the first two books of &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot; trilogy. The movie starts off with some history about the ring and how Gollum found it and Bilbo Baggins ended up retrieving it. Then the film switches to the present and Frodo, Bilbo's cousin, ends up with the ring. The ring is The One Ring that can rule all of Middle Earth. Then the first part of the movie details the beginning of the quest to destroy the ring. Then in &quot;The Two Towers&quot; film we see the battle at Helm's Deep. The ending of the film is a bit shakey but then I'll have to see the last movie in this cartoon duology to get the full story from the movies.This is a film that is very enjoyable but is still with its flaws. I'll start off with the good parts of the movie. The first part of the film, &quot;The Fellowship of the Ring&quot; part, is definitely the best as it is truest to the book. We see Bilbo's party at the beginning, the Inn at Bree, the Council of Elrond, and many other things that were in the book. The thing that was very vital yet missing was the Black Riders invading the Shire and trying to find the ring. I was wondering where this part of the movie was. Other good things about the film are the characters and just the feeling that the film gives off in certain places. In many places this film is warm and inviting, probably because of the atmosphere that the movie builds up.The bad parts are mostly that which was in &quot;The Two Towers&quot; part of the film. Most of what happened with Aragorn, Legolas, Gimli, Merry, and Pippin was true to the book as most of this part of the movie revolved around them. However, there was hardly any part of the quest of Frodo and Sam with Gollum. We only really see the two friends meet Gollum and start their quest to Mordor. If you have read the book you will remember that Frodo and Sam met a lot of men from Gondor and had a few adventures getting into the Dark Lord Sauron's city. This was the most missed part of the film. I have yet to see the other movie in this animated duology, but it is possible that this part will be there. I'm not too sure.The animation is mostly very good, but in certain places it looks that there were shots taken from live action movies and placed in an animated setting. This was a bit bothersome, but not too bad. Despite the flaws of this film it is still very enjoyable from fans of the books or anyone that seems interested in the movie. If you are a parent with young children that are familiar with the &quot;Lord of the Rings&quot; story and feel that the live action movie is a bit too violent or over their head, then I recommend this adaptation to you.Happy Reading!",N/A
582968,"Who could imagine a movie directed by Mr. Brett Ratner (Rush Hour), among all directors in the world, can be a subtle and moving experience?  There's no stereotypical situation.  Even the stock suburban Jersey characters are handled with normalcy.  Every situation is portrayed with realism and honesty.  The story line is solely based on Mr. Cage's character's view point.  It feels real because he's not immediately embracing his family lifestyle.  Through out the better part of the movie, he wanted to go back to his high-flying life as a single Wall Street player.  The change of heart is so subtle and skillfully handled by the screenwriters that you are totally convinced by the time he realized what he missed from his 'glimpsed' life with Miss Leoni and the kids.Miss Leoni is very believable in wardrobe and demeanor as an Ivy-league educated attorney turned into a Jersey wife.  She's not perfectly made-up, not a stick, and has a real glow and happiness as a wife and a mother (could it be the happy marriage with Mr. Duchovney and having two kids in real life?).  And the chemistry between Mr. Cage and Miss Leoni is palpable to say the least.Watching the movie and listening to Mr. Ratner and his producer's commentary really enforced my belief in making movies with passion.  The passion expressed by Mr. Ratner and the producer was so heart-felt, it gives me hope for greater things to come from them.To me the realness of this movie is in its ending.  Mr. Cage, after his blissful 'glimpse' of what could have been, tried to track down Miss Leoni in real life, who is a successful attorney also on a fast track, to give the love they once shared one more try (did I spoil the movie by revealing this?).  Like what the filmmakers said in the making-of documentary, Mr. Cage only asked Miss Leoni for a cup of coffee and they left the audience there imagining the possible outcomes.  They, as filmmakers, did not try to turn this story into a fairy tale.  Today's movie goers are sophisticated enough to know when a story is manipulative or not.  :)It may be too late for Mr. Cage and Miss Leoni's characters to develop a life together like in Mr. Cage's glimpse.  But it's never too late for us viewers to take stock of our life and determine what really matters.",N/A

681314,"Any resemblance to the Daniel Clowes' graphic novel upon which 'Ghost World' is based is purely cosmetic. The quiet essence of teenage angst that Clowes captured so brilliantly in his monochromatic drawings is lost somewhere in the translation.Not that the movie can't be assused of not trying...director Zwigoff just tries so hard he almost belittles his audience's intelligence. Its as though he used Clowes' basic characterization and plot structure to present his own frustrations with society, art, and cinema. Zwigoff uses the relationship between characters as a foil to the frustration of the creative individual in such a regimented market-driven country. I don't have issue with this per se...it just follows the trappings of the 'American Beauty' syndrome: soulful frustrated characters drifting through mediocrity with convenient typical ultra-liberal Hollywood plot twists.Parodied situations in this vein are throughout 'Ghost World'. In the end, the two main characters are so good-looking, you have to wonder if they would really be so angst-ridden. It eventually gets so repetative, it borders on the tedious towards its own anticlimactic conclusion.",N/A

564695,"&quot;Selma, Lord, Selma&quot; fills an important niche by telling a story of the Civil Rights Movement in a manner that is accessible to upper elementary students (and older). The characters and situations are believable, and the story is told from the perspecive of a young--almost 12 years old--African-American girl who got involved after writing a report on Rev. Martin Luther King, Jr.While this film portrays the harshness of the situation, including two deaths, it is not graphic or gratutitous. I personally appreciated the way the non-violent Civil Rights movement of Rev. King and his followers was based on their Christian beliefs. The film is not preachy, but the religious context of the movement is realistically portrayed.As the school librarian, I will be recommending this video to teachers in our elementary school as an option for the Martin Luther King holiday.","Selma, Lord, Selma VHS"
319384,"As you probably already know, this film concerns the blatantly unfair trail and conviction of Leonard Peltier, for the alleged crime of murdering two FBI agents at the Pine Ridge Reservation in 1975. The documentary begins by putting the incident in its proper perspective by showing that the Pine Ridge Reservation, at that time, had one of the highest per capita murder rates in the entire US, with the vast majority of those crimes, even today, still filed as ""unsolved"" (Check out Ward Churchill's ""Indians are Us"" and Agents of Repression for a detailed account of the killings in question). In fact, from 1973 to 1976 at least 69 Aim members and supporters were murdered&#65533;and not one person was ever convicted, or even investigated, for these brutally horrific crimes. Why were these deaths not investigated you may ask. It is because the victims were primarily American Indians involved with AIM who were actively involved in the struggle to retain the lands lawfully granted to them in the Fort Laramie Treaty of 1868 against the federal gov't and the corrupt, unelected BIA administration of Dick Wilson. Many have openly claimed that Wilson and his so-called ""goon squad"" were responsible for these killings, but no investigation was ever conducted by State law enforcement officials or by the FBI; and yet the incident that led to the shooting that left two agents and one Indian dead, centered around an investigation concerning a pair of STOLEN COWBOY BOOTS. You can draw your own conclusions from that.Although three men were originally charged with the murder of the agents in a separate trial preceding Peltier&#65533;s illegal extradition from Canada, the first two defendants were determined to be not guilty of all charges&#65533;their acts viewed as self defense. After this embarrassment the FBI decided that Peltier would be convicted at all costs and set about the task of &#65533;constructing&#65533; a case against him. After a trial marred by official perjury, witness intimidation and clearly manufactured evidence, Leonard Peltier alone was convicted, but then, only after the original judge was inexplicably removed from the case and replaced with one ""friendly"" to the FBI by a prejudiced jury of his &#65533;white&#65533; peers. This film shows the disturbing details surrounding how Peltier was ultimately convicted by this court presided over by an obviously prejudiced judge and jury on what amounts to a mountain of manufactured evidence, witness tampering, and lies.As the film and the FBI's own evidence shows there is absolutely no proof that has not been exposed as fraud, that links Peltier to the murder weapon or the red van (Peltier drove a pickup truck) that the agents reportedly followed onto the reservation. The FBI goes so far as to argue that &#65533;people in this part of the country call a pickup truck a van and vice versa&#65533;&#65533;to explain just one glaring inconsistency in the government&#65533;s case. The FBI's own statements are filled with inconsistencies and outright falsehoods, which resulted in the Federal Judge Edward McManus of the first trial harshly rebuking them for their shameful, reckless and unlawful behavior. In the video the FBI spokesman's dishonesty is clearly, if not painfully, apparent. Simply watch this video and decide for yourself. You will be surprised and certainly appalled by what you see.&#65533;Incident at Oglala&#65533; is a vitally important document detailing a form of repression and cultural genocide that has continued, although in differing forms, since the arrival of Columbus, against Native Americans. The Dali Lama, Nelson Mandela, Bishop Desmond Tutu, The European Parliament and Amnesty International have all urged that executive Clemency be granted to Peltier based on the facts of this case and the massive miscarriage of justice that it represents. This important film is a must see for anyone who cares about the ideals of freedom and justice in this country and the shameful realities that, all too often, hide behind those noble-sounding terms. For as long as men like Leonard Peltier and Mumia Abul-Jamal remain imprisoned, none of us are completely safe from the same treatment.Mitakuye Iyasin!",N/A
535699,"This film is a perfect thriller for our times.  The plot is about a computer company, NURV, run by a Bill Gates-like CEO, Gary Winston (Tim Robbins), who is perfect for the part.

Enter the psychopathic vampire Spike (James Marsters), a.k.a. ""William the Bloody,"" and his demented paramour Drusilla (Juliet Landau), to rearrange the pecking order and initiate a violent ongoing vendetta against the Slayer.  Spike has two Slayer kills already to his credit, and is eager for a third; mad Drusilla, before the season is out, will bag one of her own to match him.The Bonnie-and-Clyde vampire duo were created by Buffy's great love, Angel, before his soul was restored  -  when he was known as Angelus, the Scourge of Europe.  With classic hubris, Buffy unknowingly sows the seeds of her own psyche's doom by consummating her love with Angel, costing him his regained soul and reverting him to the exceedingly violent killer he once was.  The act ends up costing her the lives of many near and dear loved ones  -  and pits her in a life-and-death apocalyptic struggle that will force her to lose her greatest love...or the world, itself.This was the greatest tear-jerker season of Buffy, and  -  along with the third season  -  its highest dramatic peak.  The melodrama is intense, the tragedy even more so.  The story arc is very impressively handled, focusing first on Buffy's conflict with Spike and Drusilla, and the two killer vampires' newfound conflict with their sire and former mentor in evil, Angel, and then lethally tipping the scale with Angel's fall from grace and reunion with the diabolical duo.New loves are to be found, along with new cast members, most notably Seth Green as Oz, Willow's lycanthropically cursed boyfriend.

587319,"If ever a storyteller was irresistibly drawn toward the cinema and its camera's all-seeing eye, that person would be David Lynch.  ""Mulholland Drive"" uses the camera as an omniscient eye into the world of Hollywood filmmaking, utilizing the talents of three remarkable performers, Laura Elena Harring, Naomi Watts and Justin Theroux.The film begins with Harring helplessly wandering the streets of Hollywood after a collision occurs on Mulholland Drive with the limousine in which she was riding, causing an explosion, after which she barely escapes with her life.  Lynch shrewdly uses the magnificent contours of Harring's face, accenting her perfectly sloped cheekbones, to achieve maximum benefit from a purposeful camera.  Laura Elena was the first Hispanic ever to win the Miss U.S.A. contest, after which she became a countess by marrying into the prominent Bismarck family.  At that point she began studying drama in London.  Her marriage ended and she pursued her film career vigorously, with Lynch providing her with a solid breakthrough performance.Harring interacts in the film with the lovely blonde actress who won Breakthrough Performance of the Year honors from the National Film Board of Review resulting from her sterling effort in ""Mulholland Drive.""  Naomi Watts was born in England and raised in Australia.  After a decade of fervent effort to build a film career Lynch provided her with this solid break, with which she made good.  When Harring, unable to remember anything, occupies Watts' apartment shortly before her arrival by plane from Canada, the understanding young blonde woman immediately befriends her, inviting her to move in with her.  Watts, whose aunt, a famous actress, is the apartment's occupant, and is letting her use it while she is making a film in Canada, immediately assists Harring in seeking to uncover the mystery associated with her memory loss.In the manner of Lynch, the film develops into a series of dramatic situations in which the viewer is confronted with the task of separating a dreamworld of illusion from reality.  As the film develops we learn that Watts and Harring are vying for the same starring role in a major film.Justin Theroux enters the mix as a confused director.  Lynch is to be credited for never depicting Theroux as a raving lunatic, but rather someone who launches into bizarre behavior in a low key manner, rendering the character more uniquely effective.  Theroux remains outwardly calm no matter what happens, even after he is forcibly thrown out of his own Hollywood canyon home by the pool cleaner he finds in bed with his wife.By the film's end Harring is enchanting everyone, male and female.  At one point Watts becomes jealous over her attention, along with her competition for a role she wants in the film Theroux is directing.  Theroux has been warned by the gangster element financially backing the film that he is duty bound to put Watts in the starring female role, leading to conflict.One of the film's zaniest characters is a professional hit man with the efficiency level of Inspector Clousseau at his daffiest.  He is compelled to eliminate large numbers of people to cover up his staggering inefficiency.Playing the role of the shrewd ""You can't fool me"" landlady of the apartment building where Watts and Harring stay is veteran Ann Miller, who starred in MGM musicals in the fifties.  She immediately sees through the flimsy explanation provided by Watts to justify Harring staying with her.  At one point the relationship between the two beautiful young women heats up into an erotic love sequence captured beautifully by Lynch's all-seeing camera.",Mulholland Drive
701728,"First of all, I have to point out that I am a fan of the original twenty-six episode series, which I consider to be an absolutely stunning production and story, with a slightly disjointed ending.That said, I admittedly watched this with an existing bias.As a movie in its own right, this is very nice; compared to the original series it was adapted from, it's a bit of a let down. The production standards were excellent (after all, it appears to use the same cast and crew as the original series), but to somebody who had already experienced the richness of the original, the retelling was rather abrupt.In my opinion, it is best to consider this to be an alternative history type of tale, that happens to feature many of the same characters. The storyline only bears a superficial resemblance to that of the original, but it's a decent storyline in its own right. If I had seen this before watching the series, I would probably have considered it a 4 of 5 overall.Character designs are nice, and the animation is excellent. The sound quality seems to be very good, but they don't seem to be trying for the immersive audio experience of the series. I cannot comment on the quality of the dub work (didn't listen to it) but considering the company, it's probably decent. Acting on the Japanese audio is excellent, and, if I'm recalling names correctly, features the same cast as the series. The subtitles are nicely legible, although I was watching it on a 31&quot; display using an S-Video hookup.I can't comment on the extra features available, as I've only seen a rental edition (no bonus disc included), but the extra features on the main disc are minimal.",N/A

129753,"""Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade"" disappoints, for its inability to construct a believable action scene.  Who'd get taken in by this blatant cartoonery?  I, frankly, miss the stark realism and gritty humanism of ""Raiders of the Lost Ark"" and ""The Temple of Doom"".  What?  They were live-action cartoons too?  Well, that changes everything, then, doesn't it?Kidding aside, you shouldn't ever go into an Indiana Jones movie expecting credible action.  And ""The Last Crusade"" has the least credible, but at times most fun, action of any in the series.  Watch as Indy, armed only with a horse and the strap from his bag, manages to outrun and outgun a German tank.  Later in the sequence, we get a moment that for me defines the ethos Spielberg and Lucas have built for this series.  Indiana is wrestling with some Nazis on the tank.  The tank moves slowly towards a cliff.  Instead of jumping off the tank at the last minute, leaving the baddies to tumble to their doom, Indy appears to go over the cliff with them.  His entourage, which includes his stoic father, rushes to the side of the cliff just in time to see the tank hit bottom and explode.  Somber faces all around.  Just as they say their goodbyes, the camera cuts to a hand appearing by the cliff's edge, out of their view.  It's Indy!  He's alive!  After a quick moment to brush himself off, he joins his friends to see what the fuss is about.  His father does a pitch-perfect double-take upon noticing him, then explodes in joyous tears.  The scene ends with Indy, collapsed in exhaustion, surprised when his fedora, thought lost in the wreckage, tumbles into his lap.  It's a perfect blend of classic Saturday matinee hokiness with a dollop of contemporary self-awareness.  The filmmakers know that Indy's invincible.  The actors know it.  And most importantly, the audience knows it.  But for a brief moment, the film has us going.  Then it allows us to laugh at our own gullibility.Besides mocking the genre pictures from whence it came, ""The Last Crusade"" spends a lot of time winking and nudging about its own past.  The character, by this point in the trilogy, has a lot of history, and much of it is playfully referenced here.  One key moment finds Indy and his current Jones girl, Elsa, exploring the catacombs underneath a Venetian library.  Intricate hieroglyphics adorn the walls.  One in particular looks like a glowing golden box.  Elsa points it out and asks, ""What's this one?""  ""The Ark of the Covenant,"" says Indy.  ""Are you sure?"" she confirms, perfectly setting up his deadpan reply: ""Pretty sure.""  More explicitly is the infamous opening sequence, starring River Phoenix as Young Indiana.  In it we see, during one quick trip across a Circus train, the origins of Indy's fedora, his whip, his fear of snakes, and his knack for adventure.  Even though I have some trouble believing that the fragile and feline Phoenix will grow up to be the rugged and rough Harrison Ford, he has enough fun during the sequence to make my qualms disappear.Which leads me to the casting of Indy's father.  It might seem far-fetched to have the decidedly Midwestern Ford fathered by Sean Connery.  But like Phoenix, Connery has enough fun here to make you forget the differences in their accents.  You'll be won over by the twinkle in his eye and the bounce in his step.  The movie relies heavily on their chemistry, and at this task it does not fail.  Connery, who provided the model for Indiana Jones in the first place (what is Indiana Jones if not an archaeological James Bond?), plays against type: he's a bookworm.  Armed with his tweed jacket and neat bow-tie, he's hardly the Jones patriarch you were expecting.  Henry Jones is a Mr. Magoo-type character, accidentally finding ways of saving the day, when his more daring son can't.  In ""The Last Crusade"", Connery proves, through the power of his towering charisma and impeccable comedic timing, why he's still a star, some forty years after ""Dr. No"".Not so successful a casting choice is Alison Doody.  Her Elsa continues the tradition of Indy's leading women getting better and better looking, while being played by poorer and poorer actresses.  From Karen Allen, to Kate Capshaw, to a new high/low.  If this trend continues, I expect to see Denise Richards in ""Indy IV"".  True, you understand why the shallowness in Indy's character would find her appealing, but Doody brings little more than wooden line readings to the movie.While not as 'important' a movie as others in his oeuvre, ""The Last Crusade"" once again shows how adept Steven Spielberg is at manipulating an audience into high gear.  The action sequences are economical and exciting, the visual jokes work like a charm every time, and the special effects, while already dated, work in a cheesy/kitschy kind of way.  On top of all this, Spielberg throws in more Nazi imagery here than in any of his other movies, including ""Schindler's List"".  When Indy finds himself face-to-face with Hitler, in one of the film's best jokes, Spielberg doesn't miss the opportunity for some fun at the fuhrer's expense.The ending, much-maligned, does well servicing the story.  We've been leading up to finding the Holy Grail, but it's not really an important part of the story, just an excuse for mild adventures.  After all, the filmmakers didn't even bother to come up with a menacing villain to stand in the Jones' way.  What we do get is a hubristic stooge, whose obsessiveness is burning so intensely, it's obvious to everyone but him that it will be his downfall.  The ending provides some suspenseful moments, gives all the characters credible reasons for doing what they have to do to move the story along, and ties up all the loose ends.  It's a fine way to wrap up another fun entry in the Indiana Jones series.",N/A

45216,"First of all I thought the acting was good!I have a few questions about the content.I'll put that another way.I would like to see a movie that might address why the allies did not know about these camps until the Allies entered Germany.Allied bombers had no problems locating German factories and other military and civillian targets, but I never heard of prisoner of war camps or concentation camps being bombed-explain that-maybe the pilots were very lucky!Also I do not understand how people could be killed only for their religious beliefs but allied prisoners who were killing your countrymen were taken prisoner and treated according to some war rules!That doesn't make sense to me.I do not doubt nor defend any justice in the killing of any Jewish people in any way, that was horrible!I just have some questions.I will say that my mother and her family were on the receiving end of allied bombing thank God it wasn't in Dresden or Hamburg! My father is post war U.S. soldier and mother postwar West German!She accepts that as war and has been flying a U.S.flag long before 9-11-01 happened.I guess my review drifted of course abit,the movie and actors were great but alot of innocent people died in that war,not just one group!Also Hollywood sometimes gets critisized for violence but rarely gets praise they sometimes deserve,people have been killing each other long before Hollywood was around,sometimes mankind can be worse than animals to each other and over and over again.

709051,"Unlike some people I really enjoyed the HELLRAISER sequel that preceeded this one, INFERNO. It stuck more to the original concept (as in the original novel) than any of the other sequels, and actually had a new twist and a PLOT which is more than I can say for HELL ON EARTH (radio shack cenobites...ugg) and the idiotic, predictable BLOODLINE (Pinhead in Space, just like the stupid Leprechaun).So after the series had been so greatly revived by part 5, I hoped, though doubted, that part 6 might be halfway watchable.Firstly this movie is a rip-off of ANGEL HEART and JACOB'S LADDER. Secondly, it does the old ""it was only a dream"" trick every five minutes to the point where you cannot follow the plot at all. The only redemable moment is the ending which is commendable but isn't worth waiting for through the entirety of the boring, lame and redundant film.Pass on this.The interesting thing is that the people who own the rights to this series also own the rights to HALLOWEEN (or did). So if JASON VRS. FREDDY ever comes out and makes any profit, which it will no matter how campy it will doubtlessly be, then we will know whom Pinhead will eventually come face to face with. After that we can look forward to a reprise of the old monster movies like KING KONG VRS. GODZILLA which plagued the late fiftes and early sixties. Every horror movie icon will come back to fight another (which would also make for a great Playstaion 2 fighting game). THE FLY will fight LEATHERFACE. CHUCKY VRS. LEPRECHUAN is inevitable. THE THING could show up at SLEEPAWAY CAMP. Personally, I think once a franchise has reached up to part seven or, worse yet part 10 like FRIDAY THE 13TH, there is little left to do but go campy or call it quits. FREDDY went campy (super campy) by the first sequel. He knew what was up. Chucky and Leprechaun followed his lead, and Jason took his sweet time but he made it. Unless Hollywood finally lets PINHEAD and MYERS and the other greats finally rest in peace, then eventually they will be doomed to cinematic cheese. HALLOWEEN 8 (with Busta and Tyra) is an alarming warning of this.Let's hope they let PINHEAD maintain his dignity and throw in the towel. Some horror icons are too magnificent to go cheesy.

440868,"Don't get me wrong -- I'm a total Evil Deadhed all the way through. I was just disappointed in the features that should have been a bang-zoom kind of explosion that ended up being some type of Roman candles. Okay, but not what I was expecting.First the good -- the cover is excellent. Kind of this squishy latex foam (stinky) cover to simulate human skin -- it's also chock full of Tom Sullivan's drawing. Artistically, pretty cool but not great to stack with your DVDs.FANanalysis, the documentary by Bruce Campbell was great. Bruce takes Evil DeadHeads behind the scenes at conventions and offers an intimate portrayal of himself interacting. Although it was very short (23 minutes) I thoroughly enjoyed watching this little gem of an addition to this DVD. A must-see.The sound and picture of the Evil Dead is outstanding. Considering this was a cheaply made film, MAN did they clean everything up and clarify all the details of the movie. Probably the best I've seen.Plus, there are some Easter Eggs in this DVD. At main menu:Egg 1: go to EXTRAS highlight ""trailer"" > arrow left that should highlight a fish, click it (this will play a screen test for the animation of one of the zombies)Egg 2: at EXTRAS click ""more"" highlight ""fanalysis"" > arrow leftthat will highlight a skull, click it (this features a short film of a discussion of Evil Dead. Robert Tapert and the actresses who play Linda and Shelly discuss a little about what went on during the filming. Robert briefly mentions his wife &lt;who is the actress who plays Xena for those of you who didn't know> Also talks a bit about their next film collaboration that could be the 4th Evil Dead)Now, the not-so-great. Well, unfortunately, the prequel ""Within the Woods"" was apparently pulled by some yahoo guy at the last minute at Columbia. Why, we don't know but I know a number of fans were really ticked about this. Don't despair! Surf the web and you'll find ways of getting a bootleg --albeit a crappy copy, but it's out there. And you have GOT to see it -- you will see all the inspiration for Evil Dead including the parts that ended up transferring over to the next two flicks.The commentary was cut into two sections: Bruce by himself and Rob Tapert and Sam Raimi on the other. If you have the Evil Dead 2 special edition, you'd appreciate the commentary for the way they kid each other. Bruce is great with technical details but I think they should have had him comment with Sam and Rob. Sam has a tendency to get into his flicks and go quiet so there were long pauses despite the fact Rob was with him. They should have had the three of them together for one commentary as it is too much fun listening to them all kid each other and laugh about how they pulled Evil Dead off. At one point, Rob questions why they separated them for the commentaries (which tells me it wasn't their idea) and I missed their friendly bantering.The outtakes section was interesting, but boring. I got the impression it was them messing up and laughing, but alas, it was merely unused takes and footage. Not bad, but probably interesting for die-hard fans only.Overall, it's a good DVD, but incomplete. I get the impression that ""Within the Woods"" is thought of by the studios as a money-maker which might be why they pulled it at the last second. If this is apparent, then hopefully the hesitant studios will realize that the Dead series is a money maker and offer the funds for a new flick.Good for die-hard fans, decent collectable.",Evil Dead VHS

Now then, here's where Star Trek III - Special Edition will have a special place in my heart for some time.Back in the Christmas season of 1986, I got my first VCR along with 2 commericially recorded movies.  One of these movies was Star Trek III.  I requested it because I had missed it in the theaters and as Trek fans know, 1986 was the release year for Star Trek IV.  And since Star Trek II thru IV form what is commonly known by Trek fans as the ""Genesis Trilogy"", I had missed the middle movie, so I wanted to catch up.Now then, fast forward to Christmas 2001.

697753,"Wes Anderson's third film, ""The Royal Tenenbaums,"" is nothing short of amazing and was easily the best film of 2001. Why it wasn't nominated for more than Best Original Screenplay at this year's Oscars is beyond me. The same went for his sophomore effort (and what I feel is his best film of the three) ""Rushmore.""One of many of Anderson's gifts lies in his appreciation of and ability to identify deadpan humor. My three favorite moments of the film are when Richie suffers a breakdown at his tennis match and tosses his racquet at the returned ball he lightly served over the net in the first place, when Chas holds a mock fire drill and tells his boys that they all would have died, including their dog, because it took them four and a half minutes to get out of the house, and when Raleigh St. Clair replies to the question ""Can the boy tell time?"" with ""Heavens, no.""He also has the uncanny ability of accompanying his films with the perfect music (though he has been ostracized for not including certain songs that appear in his films on the actual soundtrack.) He did it in ""Rushmore"" with British Invasion songs and he doesn't falter here. The absolute best moment of the film (in a depressing, psychotic kind of way) is when Richie attempts to kill himself by slicing his wrists. The reason for this wholly rests on the fact that the entire montage was accompanied by Elliot Smith's haunting song ""Needle in the Hay.""The other reason Anderson gets good marks is because of the fabulous ensemble cast. Gene Hackman, Anjelica Huston, Danny Glover, Gwyneth Paltrow, Bill Murray, Ben Stiller, Owen Wilson and Luke Wilson are all at their best here.Kudos to everyone involved in this film; it is sure to gain classic status years from now.

91884,"Am I missing something?  Please write and tell me if I am, because I can't understand why people admire this movie.  As far as I can tell, this is what happens in ""A Time To Kill"": Carl Lee's daughter is raped and left for dead, and her white tormentors are captured.  Before they face trial, Carl kills them.  Why?  They would not be convicted, because as we all know a white southern jury couldn't possibly set aside its racism.  Carl is then acquitted by a white southern jury that sets aside its racism.  The film urges us to celebrate this verdict as some kind of race-relations watershed.  But beneath the back-slapping, soaring music and soft focus, the take home message is this: ""There is a time to kill.  If you think the justice system won't give you justice, then revenge killing is a noble option.""  Not only is this one of most appallingly idiotic dictums ever conceived, it betrays an appreciation of the justice system which is, at best, infantile.Let's apply a little common sense here.  What the white rapists did was wrong, and they should be punished for it.  What the black father did was wrong, and he should be punished for it, too.  Cases closed.  Yes, we can empathize with Carl.  Yes, put in the same position we might even do the same thing ourselves.  No, that doesn't make it right.  Even if you think Carl was rightly acquitted, the film defeats its own argument: the fact that Jake Brigance gets a white jury to recognise and set aside its inherent racism (""now imagine she's white"") demonstrates that Carl's fears were unjustified.  There was no need to take the law into his own hands after all - a black man can get justice from a white court.  However, I think a more realistic interpretation of the outcome is that a dumb jury can be sweet-talked by a pretty-boy lawyer into acquitting a guilty man they feel sorry for.  And what kind of 'justice' is that?  Don't ask screenwriter Akiva Goldsman - this is just another one of his sci-fi scripts.  Nor director Joel Schumacher - here, as in his equally insulting ""Batman"" films, he seems more interested in visually molesting his male star than in telling a decent story, and clearly spent most of his time contriving ways to get Matthew McConaughey's shirt off or setting up lingering butt shots.This film was pitched as an exciting suspense-thriller, nicely cast with a mix of heavy-weights and newcomers, and having the guts to explore some serious social and moral issues. For me, it's a vile and contemptible little film peddling an equally repulsive morality.  What the hell Spacey, Bullock and the Sutherlands are doing here is beyond me.  It's a blot on all their resumes.  Go back to your old job as a window dresser, Joel.  On the evidence of this film, pretty and pretentious facades are what you're best at.",N/A

150522,"Miller and Mallory, the heroes of ""The Guns of Navarone"" are back, sort of.  We knew them as Peck and Niven, but little else but those two characters connects this movie with the 60's classic.  Here, Mallory (Robert Shaw) and Miller (Ed Fox)hitch a ride with an American special forces team into war-torn Yugoslavia on a mission to assassinate a turncoat partisan who is betraying Tito's forces to the Nazis.  Force-10, led by Col. Applebee (Harrison Ford), has its own mission and its own ways of getting into the battle zone - neither of which they discuss with Malliry or Miller.  On their way to Yugoslavia (actually, on their way to getting their ride to Yugoslavia) the crew picks up Weaver (Carl Weathers) a sergeant on his way to the stockade.  Things don't go as planned - even for Force-10's exceptionally pessimistic planning.  Mallory and Applebee soon find themselves forced to discuss each other's secret mission and find themselves dependent on each other to carry it out.This was a sort of good movie - ironically it would do better if we didn't think it had anything to do with the original ""Navarone"".  What otherwise kills the flick is that there's no central villain - Richard Kiel plays a monstrous Chetnick who baits Carl Wethers and the rest of us, but that's about all.  There's a high-ranking Nazi who puts in an early appearance and an almost as fast exit.  The biggest disappointment is the plot - save the partisans.  The partisan commander's antipathy to his Anglo-American allies stems from his suspicion that they consider his war theater a backwater, an idea the script does little to contradict.  Still, the flick is definitely worth a look - I actually enjoyed it, especially how it tries to look and sound like a war movie made a decade earlier, rousing music and all.",N/A

664204,"&quot;How the Grinch Stole Christmas&quot; is a classic story by the master storyteller Dr. Seuss.  It has an anti-commercialist message, but isn't overly preachy.  This, however, is disgusting.  It's hypocritical in the way that it was over-commercialized, and the plot totally strays from the book.  In an attempt to lengthen the book's plot into a two-hour movie, it was mutilated and convoluted.

339146,"It's true what critics say.  Nothing But Trouble isn't Chevy Chase's, John Candy's, and Dan Aykroyd's best comedy though it still entertains.  It truly is a lot like Beetlejuice though the ending is horrible.  Chevy Chase stars as Chris, a stock market whiz and millionaire who wants to go to Atlantic City with investment lawyer Demi Moore.  However, one small violation (Candy plays the cop who brings them in) leads them to Valikenvania, a whole place filled with wrecked yards and a big unclean mansion.  In there theyfind the 106 year old Alvin Valkenheiser (Aykroyd), a judge with a extreme grudge for bankers (he thinks Chase is a banker) and has ways to punish people for breaking the law.  And as Moore and Chase run through booby traps and rooms, they meet up with several ugly-looking characters (especially those two dirty fat man who Aykroyd plays).  John Candy also has another role as Valkenheiser's daughter (that's right, he has a girly part).  The script is not Academy-Award deserving but it's not the worst script you've ever read.  It's not a complete all star cast but who cares.  Aykroyd looks horrible in the movie and though some things are way too unbelievable, I thought it was an an entertaining and creepy movie with a little comedic twist thrown in.  You should probably rent it first before you buy it.  This is the kind of movie that'll be boring the fourth or fifth time you watch it.",N/A

200257,"Walter Matthau and Joe Don Baker, two actors I can usually take or leave, are brilliant as evenly matched adversaries with very different styles in director Don Siegel's marvelously entertaining thriller. Matthau is Varrick, a rumpled but very resourceful hustler whose take from a small town bank heist turns out to be laundered Mafia money. Baker is the glib, no-nonsense gorilla hired to recover the bucks. Siegel makes flawless use of Southwestern locales as his stars engage in a fascinating game of cat and mouse that has the brutish Baker (he insults friendly whores, abuses a wheelchair-bound gun merchant and smacks sexy photographer Sheree North around before bedding her) always just a baby step behind the ingenuity of Matthau's likeable anti-hero. The junk yard-set climax, a masterfully choreographed battle pitting Matthau's crop-duster against Baker's car, is pure, edge of your seat Siegel. Who wins? Suffice to say, the ending packs one wallop of a surprise, but you will NOT be disappointed. Very highly recommended.",N/A

Finally, after the all this time, Tomino decided it was time for Amuro and Char's last mission in a full-length Gundam movie. The fans went wild.The story takes off in the year UC 0093. Without any explanation at this time, Char is now the leader of Neo Zeon and plans to send the Earth into a nuclear winter as well as defeat his long-time nemesis, Amuro. But with many old and new characters mixed up in this battle, it won't be pretty.CHARACTERSAmuro: Returning to the battlefield, now being a responsible adult.Char: Conferming his hatred when on Earth, he is the new leader of Neo Zeon.Bright Noa: The former captain of the White Base is still in action.Mirai: The wife of Bright Noa now and mother of two children.Hathaway: Bright's son who ventures out into space.Quess: A cocky rich daughter who runs off with Neo Zeon.Gyunei: Char's pupil with Newtype abilities.Cameron: Mirai's ex-fiance who is now works for the economy.Lalah Sune: Despite being dead, her ghost still haunts the dreams of Amuro and Char.The animation for a 1980's film is top notch. The funnels moves about at an insane pace battling each other across the screen. Its a marvel to witness. What this film tried to do was cram as much content and action as it could into two hours and they did a great job at that. The original voice actors from the English version of the TV series make their debut once again. They all do a relatively good job and are almost on par with the Japanese cast.The audio is quite impressive as well. You get both language tracks in either 2.0 or 5.1 Dolby. An interesting note is that the Japanese track has not been remixed as it was with the three Gundam movies. This marks as the first Tomino Gundam feature not to have been tampered with so go nuts. Sadly, the English track falls back on all those sounds you heard in the remix versions of Gundam.The extras hold up pretty well, but aren't really groundbreaking. There are two theatrical trailers for the movie, but without it being in widescreen form, you feel you've lost something. The other extra is the Gundam model music video which shows how models are put into production. Not all that fun, but still informative. The last extra is a filmography of all of Tomino's works which is nice if you haven't seen it yet.Overall, Char's Counterattack ended up being everything I hoped it would. Raging Newtypes battling each other furiously in mobile suits. I couldn't ask for better than this.",N/A

Maybe he acts with conviction because the bouncer job was already taken and this was it. Maybe he acts with conviction because those Eastern European payments may devalue before the film is finished.

665603,"Whenever you think of the Carry On films you immediatley think of the likes of Sid James, Kenneth Williams, Joan Sims, Charles Hawtrey, Hattie Jaques, Barbara Windsor etc. This British film series is now something of a much-loved institution. Always savaged by critics for its cheap puns and almost stereotypical performances, the films can be more accuratley described as cheap and cheerful. Not exactly being Shakespeare but the series did come up with some genuinley fine blends of comedy - Up The Kyber (1968), Camping (1969) and Cleo (1964) immediatley spring to mind.Now some of these films are over 40 years old and to celebrate their timeless appeal, The Carry On Collection comprises of the first 12 entries out of the 31 Carry On films made with the bonus of Thats Carry On. Sergeant (1958) initially set the ball rolling and is entertaining at that whilst Nurse (1959) catapulted the series into blockbuster success where it topped the U.S Box office Charts and ran in some cinemas for over two and a half years! Teacher (1959) is a gentle, old-fashioned comedy that still raises a smile whilst Constable (1959) marks a turning point in the series as its the first to feature Sid James - a much valued regular in the series. Regardless (1960) is a passable comedy but lacks direction in some ways with a series of sketches loosley tied in together with the link of the Helping Hands agency, whilst Carry On Cruising (1962) saw the series transferred into colour. Carry On Cabby (1963) is amongst the finest early entries in the series with wonderful performances from Sid James and Hattie Jaques, whilst Carry On Jack (1963) is missing so many of its usual regulars such as Sid James, Joan Sims and Hattie Jaques that it doesn't even neccecarily feel like a Carry On whilst Spying (1964) sees the much welcome addition of the bubbly Barbara Windsor. Their hilarious take on the epic disaster Cleopatra starring Elizabeth Taylor sees the series enter full swing and its best era, followed by the excellent CowBoy (1965) and the horror spoof Screaming (1966). These films all represent landmarks in British comedy so are therefore absolutley essential. Thats Carry On! (1977) fetures an affectionate look back at some of the best clips of the Carry on films through all eras that are linked by dialogue by Kenneth Williams and Barbara Windsor.Defintley recommended and is of fantastic value. 12 classic comic gems!",N/A

36277,"I don't care for anything John Carpenter has directed after 1982's ""The Thing"". However, I am a fan of H.P. Lovecraft's literature, and I do like Carpenter's earlier films, so when I was in the rental shop the other day I thought I'd give this film a viewing. I'm glad I did.""In The Mouth Of Madness"" is not an actual H.P. Lovecraft story; nor is it based on H.P. Lovecraft's work. It is, however, styled on and after H.P. Lovecraft's Cthulhu mythos and short stories. And the film, like a fungus, grows on you. Should you not be too impressed with it on the first viewing (as I was not), I recommend watching it again.The premise of ""In The Mouth Of Madness"" is about a fraud squad detective (Neill) hired by a publishing company to find the whereabouts of a mysterious best-selling horror novelist, as well as to look into the growing hysteria surrounding readers of his books.The performances are first rate, the story engaging and thrilling, the locations are colourful, and the cinematography, music, and special effects work very well in complementing the aforementioned. What's particularly interesting about this film is the style with which it opens: very Stanley Kubrick. And Carpenter certainly doesn't waste any time, either: there's never a dull moment in this film. And despite some big name seasoned actors in the cast, Sam Neill (who's become a big name himself) absolutely steals the show. ""In The Mouth Of Madness"" is an extremely well done, professional film with a fairly original story. And Lovecraft fans will definitely see familiar Lovecraft elements and creatures in this film, as well as get the disorienting feeling, albeit a shallow one, that Lovecraft implements in his stories about a particular narrator going mad, etc.But the film isn't without its share of downsides. For instance, I can't say that I really felt the credibility of the ""madness"", myself. It is because of the cerebral condition involved in madness, a condition that only a reader through his or her imagination can realistically conjure up and interpret, that I believe Lovecraft's work untranslatable to the big screen. In addition, I can't say I found anything in the film particularly scary, either. Eerie, perhaps - maybe even tense. But scary, no. With all the usual John Carpenter ""stingers"" and horrific creatures and sequences, I'm led to believe that this film was supposed to be scary. (I think, perhaps, I've just seen too many horror films that use the same old tricks, which this film is guilty of, to be scared by any of them anymore. Of course, should this film have come out in the early 1980s, I would've certainly been scared.) However, I did get confused, ""taken"", and muddled, as there are a good deal of twists in this film that are meant to disorient the viewer. In fact, there are so many twists that the viewer will come to expect them - which ultimately kills any kind of credibility of any particular scene henceforth. This is a problem. Another downside is the editing: certain shots should've been deleted from the film entirely to leave something to the imagination; other shots should've just merely been briefer to give more impact to the shot.However, despite the drawbacks I mentioned, which may not even be a factor for some viewers, ""In The Mouth Of Madness"" is the kind of Horror Thriller that will withstand the test of time and that one will be able to appreciate and enjoy in more than one viewing. Personally, I would've liked to have seen some deleted scenes interwoven in this film, myself, to have it fleshed out more.",N/A
676980,"I think the main strength of this movie is definitely its scenery and costumes.  Both were amazingly atmospheric and beautiful, and unashamedly echoed the emotions acted out around them.  Kidman and McGregor were both really good as the two leads - I found them believable and they created strong chemistry between them.  I also enjoyed the music although I wish 'Lady Marmalade' had been performed straight through, not just as backing for Zidler.  Some of the love songs don't seem amazing at first but they grow on you, and the Hindi Sad Diamonds play, El Tango de Roxanne, and The Show Must Go On were three songs that sent shivers down my spine - the camera angles were excellent (although I agree that sometimes it all gets a bit carried away and I would have appreciated a little less madness from the filming.)The weak point of the film is probably the characters, who are all pretty one-dimensional.  Normally this would constitute a major flaw, but in this I don't think it matters so much because what's important is the music and the atmosphere.  The actors are all doing their best with a rather weak script and that's good enough.I think this film would not be good if you were in a very cynical mood, if you hate musicals and/or high-camp glamour, or if you hate Nicole Kidman.  Otherwise, I strongly recommend it - even if you don't like it, it's different enough from most movies to make you think a little (even if it is only 'that's a perfect example of how not to make a movie'. ^_^) It's an original and exciting film and I don't regret seeing it for a moment!",N/A

104700,"Toward the end of Hammer Films' reign as THE horror movie studio, they decided to transport the Dracula character into the modern era. This was the first of two films where Dracula stalked the Swingin' Seventies.The best part of this film, sadly, is the dynamic opening sequence in which we bid farewell to the psuedo-Victorian age of the old Hammer Dracula--a battle between a Van Helsing and the Count on top of an out-of-control carriage. While there are occassional glimmers of similar excitement later in the film, this is as good as it gets. Dracula's death scene is also pretty nifty, even if he is (once again) dispatched almost as much by accident as by the actions of the hero.The biggest flaw are the thirty-year-olds that are cast as teenagers. Making matters worse, they aren't particularly good actors to begin with, so their lack of youth becomes even more distracting as the film unfolds.The only real bright spot in the flick is Peter Cushing who portrays a modern day decendent of his original Van Helsing character--sort of. There are some weird continuity issues that were probably invisible back when the film was released, but if one is anal (like me) and watches ""Horror of Dracula"" in close order to watching this one (like I did), the quirk screams out at you. Maybe there are really TWO Hammer Dracula storylines embodied in this series, rather like what happened with the Frankenstein one? (That could certainly explain the sadistic side that Dracula starting showing when Hammer Films entered the Seventies.)But, that's really a nitpick that has little impact on the overall film.It's a fact that Cushing delivers the only noteworthy performance here, with even the much-lauded Christopher Lee coming across as tired and slightly bored in the few scenes he appears in. The biggest strike against Cushing in this flick is a problem with the script; he is touted as a brilliant scholar and researcher, yet he has to work entirely too hard to figure out that the mysterious Johnny Alucard's last name is DRACULA spelled backwards! (Maybe itIt's an unfortunate fact that there are few truly chilling moments in this flick. The Satanic rite in the church where Dracula is returned to life isn't bad--although it would probably have been stronger if the actors involved had been better and had been a little closer in age to the teens they were portraying--and Van Helsing's confrontation with Johnny Alucard is also appropriately suspenseful, but that's about it. Even the final confrontation between Dracula and Van Helsing is rather ""eh.""This is the weakest entry in the Hammer Films Dracula series, with Peter Cushing earning it a full extra star all by himself.

188265,"This is not just another narcissistic music video catalogue but an attempt to capture creativity and it is done artfully revealing some of the inner churnings of a band that is semi-elusive compared to their popularity, Pearl Jam.What is surprising to me about ?Single Video Theory? is that it captures the ?everyday-ness? of the band members as they struggle and revel in the creation of their 5th studio album, ?Yield?  And in that everyday-ness we are surprised to find that they come off as everyday people, albeit immensely talented rage rockers at that, but we are brought into the ?ordinary? of an ?extraordinary? band.What's truly great in the interspersed nature of band interviews, improvs you don't hear on the record, versions of the songs in their early stages (also not on the record), and the pure love for music and creativity that comes across.  PJ's best drummer to date (and their has been a few) Jack Irons soaks his arm in a vat of ice as he recoups to once again spread rhythmic intricacies across the skins.

690585,"... 'Yes - Symphonic Live'. When I read this was a tour of YES and Orchestra I was pleased, especially seeing the track list. Close to the Edge, Gates of Delerium and Ritual are the long form tracks. All three sound outstanding with good orchestration arrangements. Of the three Close to the Edge impresses the most. Parts of Gates... just seem limp. Far from bad but at times uninspired in particular Steve Howe.I'm not sure what it is but he seems to have become fixated with clean guitar tones. The problem is some of his best and most fluid work are based on mildly to highly saturated distortion. Even his pedal steel has more grit than many of his other traditional guitar parts. Also, his stage presence while non-existant wasn't a problem, it just seemed like he was keeping an eye on everyone else. His solo pieces are pleasant although it seemed weird that all players other than the keyboardist get chances to be featured.Obviously he plays a diminished role between the orchestra and the main YESmen but at times you wish he was more involved. On Close to the Edge he aquits himself nicely, getting most of Wakeman's parts down, sometimes cleaner.In the 'wish this had been recorded' mode I could have done without another version of And You And I, Owner of a Lonely Heart and a few frequently recorded live tracks. On the other hand it is great fun to watch some of the orchestra dance around on Roundabout. There are muscular versions of Starship Trouper, Magnification and the long form songs.What is somewhat sad are the band's performances, in particular Steve Howe who has traded in the fire in his playing for precision. This is a shame as I love this guitarist's work. Also, Chris Squire is often so busy prancing around the stage that he doesn't pay attention to some less than spectacular lapses.The showmanship on this DVD comes from Alan White who seems to be the quarterback of the YES/Orchestra synergy. Jon Anderson seems to be having a great time and it radiates from the stage.The keyboard player is overdramatic, as if studying 70's prog rocker keyboardists and trying to emulate their theatrics. He doesn't have the look and seems too reserved for the faux high energy performance.Also, what was the director thinking with the cheesy special effects that crop up (thankfully) only a few times? But the icon for animations seems to show up no matter if you check the 'turn off icon' selection.Beyond this the picture is excellent with reasonable tight shots on soloists although there are still plenty of scenes of Jon Anderson playing gong while the rest of the band or orchestra go nuts. Still, the camera placements and editing are good and Dreamtime on disc 2 is revealing and worth watching.After viewing the documentary on the 2nd disc it is obvious that Howe is something of a control freak and does not play well with other guitarists, a shame as I like his playing and had hoped his personality would be as dynamic as his playing.For all the critical remarks I've made I can only dock Yes - Symphonic Live one star. The concert as a whole is very exciting and the playing is very good to exceptional.YES at it's worst is of better quality than most rock acts in existance. Watching them play is a great experience although the contrast of middle aged men rocking out with an orchestra of young, attractive people is a visually stark contrast.Even as a music DVD it's a great concert. The visuals are worthwhile and even the animations are pleasant although they can be turned off.Most importantly this DVD should appeal to old fans who will find a few newer tracks from the Magnification album which blend well with the classics.",N/A

Every outlet should apply the same standards to their work as did Criterion in this release.

It focuses more on the human side of the call to arms than any film I have ever viewed. Faced with the knowlege that Hitler was exterminating their fellow countrymen in order to provide ""living space"" for the future Reich, many millions of Russians answered the call to defend their existence. Many millions died before the war was over. Despite it's soviet origin, this film does a wonderful job of singling out just one individual, following his life through the ordeal of war, and giving us a glimpse of the true cost of the sacrifice made by the masses of young soldiers who have died defending their homelands around the globe.The dialog is outstanding.

It's a small moment, over in seconds; it doesn't even have anything to do with the lead players, except as an awful warning.  But is encapsulates what is so treasurable in Steven Soderbergh's cinema, and 'Eleven' in particular.  It inextricably links its characters' fate and struggle and endeavour to a precise place, the casinoscape of Las Vegas, a faceless monolith mocking all who presume to defeat it.  Soderbergh's vibrant, colourful, authentic filming of this milieu, with its vaults, corridors, secret passages, traps and panopticon transforms it from a gaudy joke, into a Beckett-like landscape of the soul (Las Vegas is, after all, surrounded by desert), where someone you can't see is always watching.Yes, in effect, 'Eleven' is updated John Huston.  But Huston went into his films already convinced of his philosophy - that human endeavour is doomed to failure - with an often deadening effect on his films.  Soderbergh is more open, more ambiguous, less convined of the rigidity of Fate.  He knows the dangers, but he knows the graces too.  He is more interested in certain characters than others - Clooney, Matt Damon and Carl Reiner especially - but all are ennobled by the job, by the communal bonhomie.For most of its running time, 'Eleven' just about misses out on classic status - the fleetfooted direction, giving every sequence a fresh tweak, novelty and resonance that keeps us expectant and fuelled; the engaging guy-play of the actors; the foot-flicking momentum of the jazzy soundtrack; can't quite hide the fact that the script is a bit flat, only funny because Clooney, Pitt, Gould and co. are great kidders, not because of its inherent qualities.  The Julia Roberts subplot seems initially like a bit of a sell-out that slows things down.  But, in the last 20 minutes - and I won't tell you how it happens, but you'll see what I mean - the pitch is raised, loose-ends don't so much come together as fruitfully coalesce; emotion seeps in with all the quiet, epiphanic rush of a Debussy moonlight.  The heist film escapes its mechanical grid and becomes something else, something provisional, doubtful, vulnerable, but quite beautiful - you realise that if you saw the film again, it would reveal so much more.",N/A

683801,"To say this film is good is an incredible understatement. What makes it so good is the jaw-dropping performances of its two Judys, Tammy Blanchard and Judy Davis. Ms. Blanchard plays Judy early in her life, up to Meet Me in St. Louis, and does one whale of a job. Her physical resemblance at times is eerie. Judy Davis portrays Judy from that film to the end, and HER resemblance is frightening! It's as if she 'channeled' the real Garland onto film. The concert performances were understandably lip-synced, but you feel as if you are watching actual concert footage. These two fine actresses each deserved and received emmies for their work, and the whole production should have received more. Knowing how Garland's life ended, I still broke down at the end, because it seemed like viewing history as it happened. This film is well-worth buying, and viewing over and over.",N/A

661495,"I had to get the first video of the wonderful manga series that I love! But I have to say, first off, I HATE AYA'S DUBBED VOICE! Because I am understanding about the lack of decent English seiyuus, I try to over look it, but I can't help wondering why they didn't release a subtitled version. Afterall, no one wants to miss out on Iwao Junko's beautiful voice playing Ceres. So, another thing that bugs me is that Aya's personality is very different in the anime than in the manga. In the anime she often comes out as a whiney girl. In the manga, she's more playful. Then there is the fact that they pronounce the name 'Ceres' as 'sAIR-iss'. Everyone know that the name for the Roman goddess of the harvest is pronounced 'seer-eez' sounding like the word 'series'. (Note: The name for the Roman goddess of the harvest and plants is the derivitive for the word 'cereal', you know, like those Cheerios you eat every morning. Think about that.) The last thing that bothers me about the anime is the way the main characters like Shuro and Kei have such a minor role. It's too bad, because Shuro is a really cool character. Other than that, the anime is funny, interesting and cool. It's more dramatic than the more light hearted Fushigi Yuugi, but the story is quite touching.

225250,"""The Omen"" is a supposedly scary film released in the late '70s which kicked off what was supposed to be a four-part franchise detailing the life of Damien, who we meet in this first movie.The movie's plot is rather lame: Gregory Peck, playing an ambassador, is convinced by a priest to switch his wife's stillborn (as far as he knows) baby with another baby, born June 6th at 6 a.m. Peck raises the baby as his own. Life goes on, but on Damien's 5th birthday, things occur that slowly convince Peck that his little devil actually is the Antichrist. The rest of the film details Peck's quest to learn more about Damien and questioning whether his precious little baby boy could actually be the spawn of Satan.If this sounds interesting, trust me it is not. It's all pieced together with choir music of the damned, as well as some hammy overacting, mostly from the maid and a Father who travels all the way from Italy to warn Peck of his son's quest. There's also some points about Peck's wife and her feelings toward the baby, but it's ignored later on. The film is about Peck and it belongs to him. I kind of feel sorry for this much-respected actor to appear in this film. Damien, on the other hand, is actually not really in the film that much, and if he is, it's just to stare at a dog or thrash about madly. The scenes of death and horror that occur are standard - there's the beheading, the flailing jump out a window, and such. And the whole plot seems tame compared to today. ""The Omen"" is no great scarefest.",The Omen VHS
529368,"We got to discussing favorite movies at work recently, and Vicki, one of the nurses I work with in the recovery room, said she'd seen Saving Grace and had really loved it.  She gave me a short recap of the film, and I decided it was worth a couple of hours of time and bought it. Normally I'm the type of movie goer who labors ad infinitum over the implications of each character's actions, and certainly the underlying drug theme might well have brought out that tendency with a vengeance, but in viewing Saving Grace, I was so beguiled by the charm of the village and it's delightful residents that I was able to suspend criticality and just enjoy my ""visit.""The venue of the story is a colorful coastal village in England.  Though a little bleak, the surrounding country side is open and green, with wonderful vistas of the sea, and the village is a cluster of quaint, old, stone buildings along narrow, little streets.  The title character, Grace, is the lady of the local manor and presides graciously over the social activities of her neighborhood.  Her home is a gorgeous vine covered house in the midst of well kept grounds, a home she loves and which she is unknowingly about to lose due to the capricious financial habits of her philandering and recently deceased spouse.  The story turns on Grace's outrageous plans to save her home and the naivety with which she pursues them, assisted or at least abetted by an assortment of delightful neighbors including her gardener, her doctor and even her husband's former mistress.Grace is played with great skill by Brenda Blethyn.  She's pretty and perky and just at ""that age"" where a women who had been financially independent for most of her life might find it difficult to start anew.  Even as she starts on her ""life of crime""-""I'm going to be a drugs dealer!""--one can't help but cheer her on for her audacity, just as most of her neighbors come to do.  Beset by collection notices with every post, the intrusion of an assessor who arrives as her door to evaluate her house for auction, and phone calls from a persistent London creditor, Grace takes the bull by the horns and bursts-or more properly blunders--onto the drug scene.  Craig Ferguson as her Scottish gardener Matthew, is the perfect instigator, naive enough himself to be funny but opportunist enough to see their approach to saving the manor as viable.Even though my husband and I are frequently at odds with respect to our film preferences, we both enjoyed this movie.  It was a thoroughly enjoyable and light hearted way to spend an evening.",Saving Grace

284361,"Bette Davis stars as a nightclub &quot;hostess&quot; who gets mixed up with brutal crime boss Eduardo Ciannelli, an association that leads to tragedy for Davis.  She's one of five women who work at a clip joint, their jobs being to get as much money out of the male customers as possible.  Davis needs the money to help support her kid sister's education. However, when her sister Jane Bryan also gets mixed up with Ciannelli, Davis finds herself doing battle with the mob, both in court and out.  This is an unusually tough film and roll for Davis, and it's one of her more interesting ones.  She's very good, getting a number of scenes to cut loose.  Lola Lane and Isabel Jewell as two of her co-workers also give strong performances, as does Humphrey Bogart as the special prosecutor who fights for Davis.  It's unusual not to see Bogart as a heavy at this point in his career, and the change of pace displays his versatility.  Lloyd Bacon tightly directs the film, leaving little room for sentimentality.

Dennis Morgan, Joan Leslie, and Eddie Cantor star as ... performers trying to get into an all-star performance that will feature some of the top stars of the day.  This plot serves as a link to various numbers performed by actors not usually seen in musical rolls.  That's the fun of this film.  Errol Flynn's considerable charisma is on display in his bar room Cockney song which also demonstrates his physical agility.  Bette Davis puts in a game effort singing ""Their Either Too Young Or Too Old"", which also includes her being thrown about in a dance number.  Alexis Smith also gets tossed around, lifted, and twirled in another dance number.  Olivia de Havilland, George Tobias, and Ida Lupino are jitterbugging twits in a number that shows de Havilland's sense of humour and willingness to look silly.  Ann Sheridan sings to a group of girls about love, looking very beautiful as she does so.  Alan Hale and Jack Carson do a long duet, while a very awkward John Garfield sing-speaks ""Blues in the Night.""  Humphrey Bogart has an amusing bit where the always amusing S.Z. Sakall browbeats the tough guy.  Perhaps best of all is a rousing all-black number featuring Hattie McDaniel that is full of energy.  Thank Your Lucky Stars isn't a great musical jammed with memorable songs.  It's memorable because of the performances of its non-musical cast.

265556,"The DVD's attractive packaging and the chance to see this important film in widescreen don't quite overshadow the fact that some of the extras here are nothing special.  There are two documentaries on the background of the film and much of the information is interchangeable.  Director Altman's audio commentary is disappointing; he seems uninspired, self-congratulatory, and what he says often has little apparent connection to what's on the screen.  Nevertheless, I don't want to sell this DVD short, again because it gives viewers a chance to view the film in a format that is close to what its creators intended.  Having seen old TV versions of the movie, I felt like I was seeing it for the first time.  Like many counter-cultural classics of its time, MASH doesn't always hold up well.  It is a matter of ""you had to be there"": first, the cast and crew were obviously having a hell of a good time, playing to each other and Altman, not to the audience.  In the context of Vietnam and free love, seeing this must have been exhilarating.  Now, some of it seems mean-spirited and no more progressive than the values its makers were mocking.

300974,"WHAT ABOUT BOB is one of the funniest (and most underrated) comedies ever and one of my favourite movies. The master of craziness Bill Murray has one of his best roles as the neurotic Bob Wiley, who seeks help from renowned psychiatrist Dr Leo Marvin (Richard Dreyfuss). As Leo's patient, Bob follows him to his holiday house at Lake Winnapisokee, where the crazy Bob pesters his exasperated Doc for answers to his problems. Directed with aplomb by Frank &quot;Yoda&quot; Oz, the witty back-and-forth and gradually increasing craziness between Dreyfuss and Murray is fantastic, with an outstanding script and superb comedic timing. It's also one of the few comedies that stands to repeat viewings to catch the numerous gags.The film also stars Julie Hagerty (Airplane) as Leo's wife and Charlie Korsmo (from Steven Spielberg's Hook) as Sigmund 'Siggy' Marvin.

261330,"I am an enormous fan of satire, when it's done right. Examples: Pretty much everything from George Romero (The Living Dead trilogy, ""Bruiser""), ""American Beauty,"" and books by Kurt Vonnegut. The strongest plot thread of ""Back to the Future Part II"", ultimately the lesser of the trilogy, is the element of satire, which brings out a huge string of laughs as we are catapulted from one decade/century to the next. 1985 to 2015, 2015 back to an alternate 1985, then back to 1955, where we were in the first film. We see this in the form of greed, which is symbolized in a sports almanac that tells all the results of major sporting events for the last half of the 20th century, and in the form of the dependence we can have on technology. In essence, when can we go too far with our own ""technological brilliance""? Time travel, as we have been repeatedly warned by many films, can be extraordinarily dangerous. ""The consequences could be disasterous.""This is the element that makes ""Back to the Future Part II"" a great science fiction entertainment while still coming short of the masterpiece status that was achieved by the original and the final entry. Why? Mostly because it this is the second act in a trilogy. The second act is always much darker, as is true with ""Empire Strikes Back"" and others, but when you're talking about a cuckoo comedy series, darkness can put a damper on some of a film's tone. Zemeckis and his co-writer Bob Gale did their best to overcome this inevitable trap in every scene, and for the most part, they've succeeded, but not entirely. Some of this film, while it waves the flag of satire around, goes from wacky fun to downright depressing at times. But as a whole, that is totally okay, because when the film is over, we are left with the satire, and some amazing visual effects. You can tell that Bob Zemeckis was really coming into his own as a visual stylist with this film. The cast, mostly recruited from the original feature, minus the really hot original Jennifer (replaced by the highly recognizable Elizabeth Shue), settle right back into their roles nicely, taking their characters to the next level, as they should in a sequel. What went wrong with the later ""Rocky"" sequels goes right here: The characters continue to evolve and learn new things. Stallone put his fighting hero into a rut after a while, and produced an incredibly terrible dud known as ""Rocky V"", one of the worst movies ever made. Doc and Marty, on the other hand, are always adapting. Marty, mostly just a scared but witty kid in the original film, is slowly learning that he has to become a man of action in order to make things happen. Doc's emotions become much clearer as they should, after knowing Marty for 30 years as opposed to just a few. Their connection in this film, as they hop from one adventure to the next, isn't just a straight man-funny kid kind of thing: It's a real, interesting friendship, like Daniel-san and Mr. Miyagi in ""The Karate Kid"". And it is because of this that we truly do root for them as they try to stop Young Biff from enjoying his time with the priceless sports almanac too much, steal it back and reset the balance of good and evil in the space-time continuum.I love all of these movies, and just because I'd rather watch the first and last doesn't make this one any less necessary. It's terrific, wacky fun; I enjoy it, and every satirical bone in it's entertaining body.",Back to the Future 2 VHS

698853,"Set among feuding sugarcane farmers in rural Brazil at the start of the last century, this film is in most respects a consistently beautiful achievement.  First of all, the spectacular photography, as astonishing on DVD as in the theater, is marked by a series of wonderfully lit or darkened barren and lush vistas of the sort which linger in the memory.  The acting, too, is noteworthy for the naturalness of most of the players, the older of whom have faces rightly savaged by the harshness of the vengeance code they uphold and the narrow meanness of their lives of quiet desperation.  The younger people in the film, eager for a life of more promise and joy than that offered by the declining sugar cane trade or itinerant circus performing, are to a person physically beautiful, yet frail and vulnerable to abuse, even early death, given the limited options their lives actually afford them.On the other hand, the film ,in my view, has a serious flaw, which is its dependence on the stereotypical character of the wise, unbelievably insightful pre-pubescent child not only to voice obvious truths none of the grown-ups see as quickly but also to provide the entirely predictable, essentially sentimental denouement.  With such astonishingly fresh realism marking the treatment of economic competition (i.e. the scene of price gouging at the sugar trading office) and family feuding (the appearance of the killer among the mourners at his victim's funeral) in the early and central parts of the film, the use of such a Hollywood or T.V.-style wise kid is both jarring and disappointing.",Behind The Sun

Both Ingrid Bergman and Gregory Peck have such class and make a seemingly unlikely yet compelling match. After all opposites attract, don't they? While Alfred Hitchcock would go on to make even better films this remains a solid effort with enchanting results. Listening to people complain about the ""bare-bones"" DVD from Anchor Bay is amusing. The picture and sound quality are dazzling. Maybe they should remember that most of us shelled out more for VHS copies of Hitchcock films that didn't look this good on the first viewing and it was all down hill from there.

The film shifts backwards and fowards to link the plot of a string of gangsters that hideout in an old warehouse after a robbery goes horribly wrong. The paranoya rises as they each try to figure out who has ""betrayed"" them by informing the police. Its a case of ""honour amongst theives"" and as the tension rises the film becomes more enduringly compelling, packed with attitude-laced and sharp, fast dialogue and some outstanding performances from its array of stars. Each star bites into its character with a venegance and carries it off with style, displaying, raw, gritty and instinctive realism. Michael Madsen plays the psychotic, sadistically evil, ear-slashing Mr. Blonde, whilst Harvey Kietels Mr. White displays a more two dimensional chaater. Particularly outstanding is Tim Roth as the ill-fated undercover detective and Steve Buscemi as the exasperated Mr. Pink. The film is packed with surprise twist and turns and each scene is played out too utter perfection. The harrowing climax is essentially effective, whilst th film also holds many other brutal, stomach-churning acts of violence but this does emerge as a highly origanal, compelling and cunning gangster film that exceeded all expectations.

Los Angeles Times reporter and prize-winning journalist Chuck Phillips, has declared that the late rapper Notorious B.I.G. (killed the year after) is responsible for Tupac's murder. Earlier on the night of his murder (September 7, 1996) Tupac and Suge Knight had attended a Mike Tyson fight at the MGM Grand Hotel and Ceasars Palace. The first part of Phillip's report appeared in the LA Times today (Friday, Sept. 6, 2002), the second is scheduled to run in tomorrow's edition.Phillips claims that Biggie (a.k.a. Christopher Wallace) provided the weapon used to kill Tupac as well as a $1 million bounty. The report also identified the man who pulled the trigger as Orlando Anderson, a former member of L.A.'s Southside Crips gang. Just hours before Tupac's death, Anderson was jumped and beaten by Shakur and his bodyguards (who were also part of the Crips' rival gang, the Mob Piru Bloods). Until now, Anderson was never identified as a suspect in Tupac's murder and was later killed in an unrelated shooting. Chuck Phillips' report is based on his year-long investigation which supposedly included interviews with members of the Southside Crips who had never before spoken out about the killing.Shortly after his beating, the report claims that Anderson and the Crips set up a meeting with the Notorious B.I.G. (who was also in town for the Tyson fight) in the penthouse suite at the MGM. The report further states: ""According to people who were present, the Crips envoy explained that the gang was prepared to kill Shakur but expected to collect $1 million for its efforts. Wallace agreed, on one condition, a witness said. He pulled out a loaded .40-caliber Glock pistol and placed it on the table in front of him. He didn't just want Shakur dead. He wanted the satisfaction of knowing the fatal bullet came from his gun.""Despite the fact that Biggie and Tupac insulted each other in public and in their own music, three days before his own murder, Biggie discussed his turbulent relationship with Tupac on a San Francisco radio station. When asked if he had a role in Tupac's killing, Biggie responded by saying ""he wasn't that powerful yet.""The details within the LA Times report go on and on. The ultimate question now remains: is this report revealing the truth? Or is it as valid as the other rumors (including Tupac faking his death) that have circulated among hip-hop fans? The truth may never be revealed. All that is certain is that the saga of Tupac's (and Biggie's) murder continues.",Tupac Shakur: Thug Angel
19157,"A drifter named Hal finds himself invited to an annual picnic in a small Kansas town; trouble and romance follow...Although I'll have to admit that this film has certain flaws: the slight miscasting of the too-old leads, the direction which dates quite badly and the rather bad performance of Rosalind Russell as the desperate spinster schoolmarm - it still has the ability to hold one's interest throughout. Kim Novak hasn't much range as the beautiful, shy Madge, and as Millie, the plain, intellectual little sister, Susan Stasberg is adequate. Although Holden gives his best shot as Hal, it seems his then 37 years were against him; a commendable try otherwise. As Rosemary, the spinster schoolteacher, Russell overacts horrendously, but has a fine scene - where she's less affected and more realistic -talking to O'Connell on the wooden steps of the boardinghouse. Likeable Cliff Robertson is rather neutral in his journeyman role as Alan (his father is played by Milburn Drysdale (Raymond Bailey) without his hairpiece!) As Mrs. Potts, the sweet old lady neighbour who likes Holden and took him in, Verna Felton gave a beautifully memorable performance and Betty Field does well as Flo (although I felt Flo too easily gave up fighting against Madge's determination to be with Hal; it seemed against her character) The film is very fifties and the ambience of it all is like a nostalgic look back at a much simpler time (the town in which they shot the film was in actuality Hutchinson, Kansas)",N/A
561504,"Quite possibly the most disgusting comedy ever made that never stops being funny(yes, it even beats out Theres Something About Mary), Scary Movie is undoubtadly completely absurd and absolutely hilarious.  Spoofing the totally not scary teen horror movies of late like Scream, Scary Movie takes ever cliche and makes fun of it until your laughing out loud.  It even pokes fun at teen sex comedies like American Pie with the groosout antics.  Marlon Wayans is hysterical as pot smoking Shorty, and manages to keep being funny with the pot jokes without getting stale or repetitive.  Then theres also the fact I never thought I'd see so much male genitalia in a mainstream movie, but its all done with fun in mind.  The deleted scenes are worth noting too, especially the ""Hop Along Shorty"" scene which is downright hilarious.  Not to be taken seriously by any means, Scary Movie deserves a place in your movie collection.",Scary Movie
376555,"This is the third major cinematic retelling of the story of the Bounty.  The standard is still the 1935 version with Charles Laughton and Clark Gable, of course, but this most recent version has the advantage of color, and plenty of beautiful, topless Tahitian women.Speaking of which, this retelling places the major responsibility for the mutiny on the beautiful, topless Tahitian women.  Hopkins portrays Captain Bligh as hard-nosed, but not cruel, and his disciplinary actions are depicted as well within the bounds of what was acceptable in those days.  No keel hauling, no letting people die of thirst, no banishing people to the rigging during storms, etc.  The problem is that Fletcher Christian has fallen in love with a Tahitian princess, who becomes pregnant with his child, and he is heartbroken about leaving her.  Bligh is totally insensitive to his friend's predicament, and chooses that moment to start running a tight ship.  Even so, Christian is conflicted about the mutiny.  He seems to know he is doing the wrong thing, but can't help himself.This may be a more balanced (and perhaps more historically accurate, I don't know) portrayal of the story, but it leaves you with no one to root for and no one to identify with.  You feel bad for both men.  You feel sorry for Christian, because it must have been gut-wrenching for him to have to leave his young Tahitian wife, but you can't really approve of the mutiny, either.  On the other hand, you do not like Bligh, who is an insensitive, arrogant prick, but he has done nothing that even comes close to justifying taking the ship away from him.On a technical note, the picture looks great, and the sound is unusually good for DVD.  On the negative side, there are no extras whatsoever.  I am chagrined to learn, from a previous reviewer, that there were two commentary tracks on the British version.  The DVD is being sold inexpensively in America, but I bet most buyers would have gladly paid a little more to get the version with the commentary tracks and some decent extras.",The Bounty VHS

191332,"I was really looking forward to this, as I'm a big fan of the actors, and enjoy fresh perspectives on the Arthurian legend.  But I was hugely disappointed. The dialogue was awful, the plot hackneyed and (worse yet) BORING, and the ""magical!"" special effects some of the worst ever.My biggest complaint about ""Merlin"" is that the writers seem paralyzed by a fear of any conflict at all.  Nothing in the story is remotely complex or interesting.  Merlin is a ""famous powerful wizard"" who is the most passive 'hero' imaginable -- he doesn't DO a darned thing.  He's famous basically just for existing -- he just kind of stands around through the hours and hours of the story, while Miranda Richardson (who seems to have a new career in overacting these days) throws hissy fits and the badly miscast guy who plays King Arthur leads his knights in neverending prayers thanking God for being on their side (which by the end gets tiresome and a little disturbing). The much more controversial ""Mists of Avalon"" at least had the bravery to give its characters, good and bad, reasons for who they were.The romance is sadly flat and uninteresting too -- Isabella Rossellini's role as Nimue is so sanitized that there is nothing for her to do.  She is also badly miscast, and while she's gorgeous as always, she's just not ""girlish.""The lesser villains played by Martin Short and Bonham Carter are ironically the most human, poignant and interesting in the bunch -- too bad their storyline is maybe 15 minutes long. Short in particular is wonderful, arresting, and surprisingly romantic in his role -- it's almost worth all the dreck just to see such a change of pace for this versatile actor.(If they were going to make a miniseries of Merlin's adventures, too bad they couldn't have done it right, and chosen Mary Stewart's incredible Merlin books such as The Crystal Cave or The Hollow Hills for inspiration...)The actors deserved better here -- and so does the audience. Director Steve Barron did a far better job at ""magical"" entertainment with the wonderful ""Arabian Nights"" miniseries a few years later (it's is as exciting and well-written as this is not).  If you want to watch 'magic,' rent that instead, and skip this trash.",N/A
471575,"The fun guys who put this together fully intended to see how much they could get away with.  As the story goes, even the title (after others were rejected) slipped by the censors.  Once the censors got it, it was too late to change it, so score one for the good guys.I'm pretty liberal with letting my kids view movies.  This one I keep away from them.  It's loaded with possibly more profanity per minute than I've ever seen in a movie.  But you know what? When I saw the movie, I hadn't laughed as loud in a long time, and I'm embarrassed to say it was at all the childish parts.  Embarrassed, but extremely pleased I saw it.But I would not give the movie five stars if it was just a lot of potty humor.  Well, maybe I would.  But this one has a lot more.  For one thing, it's a musical, with original, funny, full-length songs (take note &quot;Moulin Rouge&quot;).  And they're songs that tie in with the plot of the movie, not just ones where the plot stops so someone can sing a song.  Not that you'll ever hear most of them on any airwaves.And, agree with it or not, the social satire is excellent.  The major theme, of course, is censorship itself. But we get to see excellent shots taken at Sadaam Hussien.  We also see Satan as a somewhat sympathetic character, as we hear a song from his point of view.  While they also poke fun at the true odds of anyone actually making it to heaven, you'll be surprised at how heart-wrenching Kenny's final act of heroism is at the end of the movie.Great film.

707695,"This is a beautifully done black &amp; white film about a man stuck in the late 1920s (he mentioned &quot;Lindy&quot;, so it's post-1927).  It's an oddity of a film, one that isn't clear about its own rules.  Some other characters also live in the 1920s, and both &quot;moderns&quot; and &quot;Twenties&quot; people easily intermingle with each other.  Yet mainly it's just Johnny who's perceived as odd by &quot;moderns,&quot; not the record store owner or &quot;speak-easy&quot; folk.The acting, dialogue, cinematography, and art direction are all sublime.It's only drawback is that it's a &quot;one-joke&quot; film (or perhaps a &quot;one-concept&quot; film).  It's short, about an hour and 15 minutes not including credits, yet I was getting bored halfway into the film.  It's a pleasure to watch, but once you &quot;get it,&quot; that's all there is.  The characters have a shallow cartoonish feel.  Interesting to watch and listen to, but there's no emotional depth to them.  None of them grow or change or learn.  But that's okay, as this is not a film with a serious intent -- the plot itself is tossed aside at the film's end, as everyone joins in a 1930s song &amp; dance number.This film is aimed at the mind, rather than the heart or the guts.

551642,"Lest anyone think this is the same old story of the moon shot, ""One Small Step For Mankind"" and all that, Nova's ""To The Moon"" is actually two fascinating hours of many of the stories that have been overlooked about man's journey to the moon.  Few people know about the man who advocated the method of travel, called Lunar-Orbit Rendezvous, or why he was unpopular even after his contribution led to man getting to the moon.  Few people know why Kennedy vaguely said we should get a man to the moon ""by the end of the decade.""  Few people know the history of the Gemini program, lost between the Tom Wolfe heroics of Mercury and the Cold War glories of Apollo.  Few people know about the later astronauts--in fact, how many people can name an  astronaut after the Apollo 11 crew?  (If you saw ""Apollo 13"" this might not be as hard.)  The clips of the last mission on the moon, with happy-go-lucky geologist Harrison Schmidt dancing around digging for moonrocks, is worth the price of the DVD alone.

113206,"Next to An American in Paris and Meet Me in St. Louis (which I am dying to see), this is one of my favorite movie musicals. Gene Kelly gave one of the greatest performances of his life. I was first introduced to this musical by way of the Great Movie Ride at the MGM theme park in Disney World. It's the first thing you see as the ride starts. Then, I started singing it in my music class. Then, I saw a diaper commercial of a baby dancing in the rain to the recording of the song that obviously recorded by Gene Kelly. Then, in my third year at theatre camp, the tap class performed the number wearing ponchos and hats. They even had the number itself projected on a video screen. Actually the video itself was on mute and they were dancing to a recording. I knew I was in love with this musical. Then, I saw snippets on That's Entertainment and That's Entertainment Part II. I'm not sure if there were snippets of the musical in That's Entertainment III. When I bought this musical on DVD, I was shocked that there were 60 chapters. I watched it first on my computer because my parents were watching the Boston Pops' 4th of July concert downstairs. When I saw the movie sequence, even I thought that Lina had a lovely voice that matched her personality onscreen. Then, when she first spoke, I thought, ""Oh my God, no wonder Don was upstaging her."" Donald O'Connor was very funny. His song, Make 'Em Laugh, was a celebration of how important comic relief is. I loved the part when he started singing, ""Oh my little mammy/Down in Alabammy"". I loved the flashback scene when Don was telling the story of his life. He was lying through his teeth, baby. Debbie Reynolds has become quite a star. She even sang Singin' In the Rain at last year's Boston Pops 4th of July concert and she was great. These days, she's doing the voice of Lulu, Granpa Lou's new wife, on Rugrats. I thought it was a little gross that they mixed milk with water to create the rain effect. I'll admit that it did make the rain look more visible but Gene Kelly must have had to take a long shower especially after the shot where he looks up and water pours on his face. Good thing they'll never actually invent Smell-O-Vision. This musical is wonderful. Practically all of the main characters get to sing except for Dexter, the director. Lina becomes a real villain towards the end. Buy the DVD and you will thank me.",N/A
16583,"With a few exceptions, it seems like Hollywood filmmakers today have forgotten how to make great action/adventure films. Instead of presenting complex, interesting characters making their way through difficult situations and using plot twists and cinematic techinques to provide the suspense, filmmakers today often get stuck on the action and special effects components. Even more depressing still, many people seem to think that this is the only kind of action/adventure movie nowadays. But, enough of bashing Hollywood today and on with the review.So, to see a first-rate, exciting, intelligent action/adventure movie that does NOT rely on special effects to entertain, watch The Guns of Navarone. Although the special effects seem quite primitive, everything else about this movie puts current Hollywood blockbusters to shame. It features excellent actors, complex characters, a compelling plot, good cinematography, and is overall one of the finest action/adventure films out there.In The Guns of Navarone, a group of highly skilled men are put on a seemingly impossible mission: to, in a few days, make their way through the ocean, over a cliff, and go and destroy two huge heavily-guarded German guns on the island of Navarone, which are preventing the escape of British prisoners on a nearby island. If they fail, all the prisoners will be killed - but if they succeed, they will save two thousand lives!Besides the thrilling action sequences, The Guns of Navarone presents several facinating characters, played by Gregory Peck, David Niven, and Anthony Quinn, who all give excellent performances, and offers some interesting insights on the nature of leadership and whose responsibility it is when men are killed. So, this is a must-see for anyone curious about what truly great action-adventure films are. Enjoy!",N/A

219351,"I'm a huge fan of John Wayne and I'll never get tired of him, but I must admit it was nice to see him take off those cowboy boots and hat for once. This hillarious comedy-adventure by director Howard Hawks has great preformances by all involved. The African surroundings are really cool. There isn't any real plot and the pacing is sort of slow, but it still by all means delivers the goods. However, it does have a few minor flaws. The animal chasing sequences, though beautifully photographed, do tend to get old fairly quickley (by the fourth or fifth time, your eyes just wander off or you simply groan). And the last 20 minutes or so seem just a wee-bit too sentimental (or maybe melodramatic is the word). But in a 2-1/2 hour movie, it doesn't affect the movie all that much; in fact, hardly at all.

596282,"""Minority Report"" is, without a doubt in my mind, the best film so far this year. I will even go as far as saying it is one of Steven Spielberg's most ambitious, creative, visually stunning and best films in years. He has created a film that redefines him as a director. Much like Spielberg's last film ""A.I."", this is a far step away from his previous films. This film is dark and gritty at times and has a very gloomy tone to it. But this is not a bad thing. It actually adds to the greatness of the film. It was nice to see Mr. Spielberg stretch his talents to new heights and make a different film that you would not expect him to make. The film reminded me a lot of Ridley Scott's ""Blade Runner"". I guess concidering that they are both losely based on stories by Phillip K. Dick, but the look and set design really made me think of that film. The visual effects come into play a lot in this film, much like they did in ""Blade Runner"". The amazing visuals help in telling the story and bringing the new technology used in the film to life.The performances in the film a great all around, especially Tom Cruise who gives one of his best performances in years. The entire supporting cast is equally good, especailly Colin Farrell  who is fantastic and Samantha Morton as the female Pre Cog who Cruise's character gets help from. I truly hope that the Academy does not over look this film when Oscar season starts because it truly is a gem and should not be missed.",N/A
29701,"Only one year after ""Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles - The Movie"" is released, we are presented with a sequel. And I must say though I find the first movie a fun and entertaining movie, I found this sequel lots more fun and better than the first!It's only been a short while since the end of Shredder and the scattering of the Foot Clan. Searching for a new home, Leonardo (Mark Caso), Raphael (Kevin Scott), Michaelangelo (Michelan Sisti), Donatello (Leif Tilden), and their master Splinter (Kevin Clash) are forced to stay with their reporter friend April O'Neil (Paige Turco). But soon they discover that a TGRI scientist Professor Jordan Perry (David Warner), might have some answers about the ooze that had mutated them 15 years ago. Unfortunately for them, they find out that the evil Shredder (Francois Chau) is still alive and regrouping his Foot Clan. Shredder also wants to discover the secret of the ooze so he steals the last container of it, along with the Professor. Can the turtles stop the Shredder before he puts his terrible plans to work? Also starring Ernie Reyes Jr. as Keno, a young teenager with martial skills, and special appearance by Vanilla Ice as himself performing a rap song.The whole atmosphere of ""The Secret of the Ooze"" is much brighter than the first movie, one good point for this movie. This is Jim Henson's last movie to work on so you will notice in the beginning you will read, ""In memory of Jim Henson"". He does an incredible job with the turtles and Splinter, and also with two other mutants Rahzar and Tokka.I found this movie to be a lot more funny and incredibly hilarious comparing to the first. I especially love it whenever Splinter tells his students to do '10 flips... now'. :) Another improved point in the movie from the first is the more likable Ninja Turtle's characters. Leonardo is more of a leader, though he is teased by Raphael about being so respectful to Mast Splinter. Raphael seems to have calmed to hot temper a lot more and is much more bearable. We can see Donatello's skills in computers and his love for science. And Michaelangelo, he's still a 'very cool dude'! I loved it when he started repeating lines from ""Casablanca"" to April. VERY funny!The fighting also feels better choreographed though the turtles don't use their weapons very much. The best fight scenes are the beginning fighting against the looters, all the fights against the Foot, the end fight with Rahzar and Tokka. Keno is also a very exceptionally martial artists and it's fun to see him pull a few of his own moves.To sum it up, don't miss out on ""Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: The Secret of the Ooze""! I assure that you'll simply love it! Rated PG for the fighting though not at all graphic. No language problems so this movie should be no problem for younger kids. And the movie is for the whole family since my parents also loved watching this with me! But I recommend you first see the first movie because throughout the movie there are references to it. Also, don't forget to check out the third movie!",N/A
231365,"I found this to be a great movie about the Green Berets and the Special Forces. I find it disturbing that it gets so much bad press cause it didn't have an anti war message or that it didn't portray acurately the war in Viet Nam. First on the anti war message. I think that the scene where they tell David Jansen, the reporter, about how the communist went in and killed all the politicians, the school teachers, women, and children ( which proved to be accurate after what we saw and found out in Cambodia under the communist) and when he found the little girl dead and mutilated is one hell of an anti war message. It also sends a message that even though a soldier despises war that somebody has to stand up and fight for what is right.I think that people saying that it did not portray the Viet Nam war accurately are misguided. The war that covert ops and the Green Berets fought was much different than an 18 year old green draftee. Most Green Berets were seasoned veterans and non com's. And depending on the time of the war you are portraying (in this film it is very early in Americas part of the conflict) the war was a different war. Not large scale with those same green troups.Anyway I thought that this movie showed both sides of the conflict and the men stuck in the middle. I thought Jim Huttons performance was very good, as well as Aldo Rays. John Wayne and David Jansen were brilliantly matched as to opposite extremes of a question. This movie is the bridge between the old gung ho type war movie and the anti war movies of the 70's. But no less compelling.",The Green Berets VHS

I won't spoil the  great plot for you by giving anymore details to the story, but I will say that I was touched and uplifted by Sarah's great level of character. She is very generous, talented, thoughtful, and she can believe she will be alright, even in cruel circumstances, and she is more than alright! There is a perfect ending to this perfect movie. I would give it more than 5 stars if I could.",A Little Princess VHS
211358,"FLASHDANCE - is one of those films back in the 80's that when it opened up it became a huge success. I think mainly because it was a Rocky or Karate Kid-type movie. It had an upbeat theme, great music and characters that had nothing and achieved their dreams.Directed by Adrinne Lynn (Fatal Attraction, Indecent Proposal) the film launched Jennifer Beals ( The Bride, Vampires Kiss ) into stardom over night. Her love interest, played by Michael Nouri ( Captain America, Black Ice ) also had achieved recognition for this film. Even the model/dancer Cynthia Rhodes (Staying Alive, Runaway, Dirty Dancing) went on to achieve great success.The story is simple. As small eats-coast/mid-west town girl has a dream of going to a real ballet school and become a professional dancer. The school is elite, expensive and requires an approval process that included an audition. She is non confident and has little self-esteem.The other thing that makes her feel less adequate is the fact that though by day she work in a welding mill - by night she is a club dancer in a local bar. The odds are against her - and except for her closest friends - no one can think she can make it. Guess what? I leave the rest for you to enjoy. Very positive ad upbeat film about any one can achieve their dreams if the keep on trying and believe in themselves.There are many DVD extra's on it and it would have been nice to hear the cast commentary, or the directors AND the cast (the cast is always more interesting then the directors commentary - unless its Mel Brooks, Woody Allen, Billy Crystal, Carl Reiner - former actors turned directors) but they must have not wanted to pay them. (Paramount that is.) Overall a great film for the spirits to be lifted for everyone who watches it. Let me know what you think. (12-10-02)",Flashdance VHS

Every episode show great creativity and imagination, far beyond what most series do (some of which burn out even before they complete one season). Look beyond the fact that every world looks like Canada (the series is filmed there, a TV budget wouldn't allow for world travel)and everyone always seems to speak English (too hard to come up with a new language eac week)this is one good show. I think one of my personal favorites is the episode &quot;1969&quot; with it's time travel aspects but all of them are good.

319974,Great movie! If you have home theater so much the better. I saw the movie in the theater and this is just as good. The first half of the movie looks at the battle for Little Roundtop from the North's perspective. Th second half looks at Pickets Charge from the South's Perspective. This is where the stereo sound comes in. The cannonade before Pickets Charge is spectacular. It also has bonus of the Making of Getttysburg which gives an insight on how the movie was made.

587347,"Although so many customers have reviewed this film, I just had to comment because it it such an effective and subtle piece of cinema for Todd Solondz. Unlike `Happiness', this film's dark home truths don't kick you squarely in the stomach- they simply slap you sharply across the face, which is in some ways more effective because it seems less like Solondz is just employing cheap tactics to shock. Of course there are shocking elements; but the most shocking are the insulting personal interactions that are taken for granted as `normal', (especially considering Consuella, the househelp.) I would recommend reading the screenplay too, as it reminds you acutely of the awkward screen silences that make the movie so true to life.",N/A

While it was hard to grasp the entire meaning of the movie at that time, I knew this was more than just another Civil War film. A few years later, I read the original novel on which this was based. Though there are a few minor details that were changed for the movie, on the whole, this is a great film.The plot follows tragedy after tragedy on the plot of searching for love and trying to escape poverty. The fantastic costumes, unearthly beauty of Vivien Leigh and the charming handsomeness of Clark Gable, the extravagant indulgence of the scenery and brilliant camera angles (such as photographing the shadows during melancholy scenes)all adds to one great viewing pleasure.I've seen the movie well over 50 times by now, and you know what?

Both have been slashed by the censors!What most anime fans who watch this version of the film do not know is that it has been cut in one key place, namely the Chun Li shower scene.

717233,"First of all, let's not kid ourselves--""Hercules Against the Moon Men "" ( HAMM ) and the ""Witch's Curse"" ( WC )are pretty bad movies. However, for people like me who remember those dubbed, Italian ""spear and sandal"" epics from the early 60s, these films still provide good fun. If you are expecting big-budget production values, plots that make sense and great special effects--stay away !HAMM gives us ""Alan Steel"" as Hercules--he certainly has the physique but, for me, Steve Reeves was, and always will be, the best Hercules. Reeves was always knocked for his acting--well, Steel makes Reeves look like Olivier ! Basically Herc has to overcome one obstacle after another to battle forces from the Moon ( don't expect too much here ) and the evil queen who is under their control. Probably the highlight is when our hero is captured, and placed between two slabs of wood with huge knives pointing toward him--as those nasty points get closer, Steel gets to flex his muscles all over the place. This is a classic moment for Hercules' fans. Actually, I found the finale of the film very quick and disappointing. Overall, if you like a healthy serving of cheese and muscle, HAMM delivers.As another reviewer has pointed out, an error occurred in the transfer of HAMM--figures seem abnormally stretched--if a corrected version is released will my friends at Amazon send a replacement ( hint--hint )? Added note, dated 15 July 2006--I guess the answer to my last question is a resounding ""NO"" !WC is even more outlandish--it is 17th century Scotland--everyone is heavily clothed ( Scotland can be chilly ! )--and here comes muscle-bound Kirk Morris running around in briefs. This is one of many smiles you will get from this ""so bad it's good"" movie. Again, in his search through the underworld for an evil witch, our hero--Maciste--must use all of his strength to defeat various phony-looking monsters, and avoid one scrape after another. This is a very bizarre movie, but I found that I had to keep watching it.The transfer of WC is not great--but it is not poor enough to spoil your fun.Overall, a fascinating double bill--what's that expression--"" they don't make them like that anymore "" !",Hercules Against the Moon Men / The Witch's Curse

I could ramble on about the sub Mad Max 3 plot or the characters but hey lifes too short.  Which was something I realised after wasting 2 hours of my life watching this.

497566,"This is top notch movie.  I left the theatre physically exhausted.  Not from it being bad, but from being so intense!  After seeing this movie, and a documentary on the subject, my respect for the men of the special forces has quadrupled.  The ability, training and raw courage of these soldiers was awe inspiring.  The fact that only 18 men were killed is a tribute to the skill of these soldiers.As far at the particulars of the movie goes, it was very well directed and acted.  The casting was great.  Incredibly violent.  Believe it or not, it was actually toned down from what really happened.  Josh Hartnett was actually good in this movie.  He should stick with serious movies and get away from those teenie-bobber movies.  The sets and scenerey were perfect and really set the mood.This is a serious movie folks.  There's no political message nor is there a sappy love story to pass the time.  If you know the story behind the movie it will actually make you angry.  The main reason this tragedy occured was Bill Clinton and his crony, Les Aspen.  The special forces were not allowed to have proper suppport (Bradley fighting vehicles and C140 Gunships) for the simple reason of not looking ""too provocative"" in a foreign country.  If you have any doubts about that, just ask the parents of some of the dead soldiers.  One of the fathers refused to shake hands with Mr. Clinton, at a ceremony honoring his dead son.  Another father refused to accept a hand writen letter of condolence from Mr. Clinton.  He sent it back with a letter of his own.",N/A

520528,"My initial reaction to the film was that I must have missed something. This was the classic that critics and fans alike had raved about? After talking it over with a few friends I have discovered I am not alone. I will not decry this as a bad film it is simply heavy going. For myself I had to watch it in two parts as I fell asleep after the first two hours.Tolkein's stories, though regarded as classics, read like literary exercises rather than narratives and Peter Jackson's film follows suit. Where George Lucas got things very right with Star Wars (Episode IV, not Episodes I & II which coincidentally fall into the same trap as Tolkein's work) by plunging the audience straight into the action and showing us who were the good guys and the bad guys, The Lord of the Rings feels the need to describe it all in minute detail. Did we need to know the history of Wookies to know that Chewbacca was a good guy? No, it was simply obvious. Do we need to know the history of every species in Lord of the Rings? Apparently. The world of Middle Earth seems to be flung at you, Orcs and all, and you can either sink or swim. I sank and I won't be resurfacing for the next two installments, my curiousity having been sated by a quick search for online synopses. One page for all three books and I don't think I missed anything important.",The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring
699407,"Attend the tale of Sweeney Todd.His skin was pale and his eye was odd.These are the first words of one of the finest musicals ever written. It was written by one of my favorite composers, Stephen Sondheim. It starred one of my favorite performers, George HearnAs SweeneyAs Sweeney ToddThe Demon Barber of Fleet StreetI'm sorry. I couldn't resist. There are other great performers. Patti LuPone is brilliant as Mrs. Lovett. Personally, when I first heard her sing ""The Worst Pies In London"", I didn't ""Lovett."" It was more like yelling than singing. The second time, it was all right. However, I have discovered after that experience that I am prone to change my mind about an actor's performance. For example, sometimes when I watch Jekyll and Hyde: The Musical, I think, ""Oh, God, David Hasselhoff stinks at singing and acting."" Sometimes, I think his singing is o.k. and he could be less hammy and so on and so forth. Lisa Vroman, from Hey, Mr. Producer, plays Johanna. Her singing is divine but her acting is not. I hear that she's playing Christine in The Phantom of the Opera on Broadway. When she delivers what (in her case) thankfully little dialogue she has in the show, I am surprised that at her first line, she is not greeted with hisses, boos, and a storm of vegetables and watermelons. I never heard of Neil Patrick Harriss until my dad told me about him. He was very good in this show which is amazing because when they tape a musical with a t.v. star in a singing role, in the case of Jekyll and Hyde, sometimes they stink.I was first introduced to Sweeney Todd when I saw the cast recording at [a local bookstore]. Then, I found out more and more about the show. I found out that the licensers rate it R. I saw a picture of the show in which a victim was already killed and blood was flowing down his cape. Then, I heard about the concert version being shown on t.v. on Halloween (very appropriate). I wanted to know a bit more about Sweeney Todd. With the 1982 live taping starring George Hearn (again) and Angela Lansbury (the original Mrs. Lovett) out of print, all there was was thbe cd and libretto. I decided to just forget about the show altogether especially when Dad said that it wasn't for me. I saw snippets of the concert version at a Virgin Atlantic store in New York (ironically, I was in New York City to see another Sondheim show, Into the Woods.) I was a little confused by the scattering of the orchestra.Then, I found out that it would be rebroadcasted on t.v. on Wednesday, October 27, 2002. I taped it and watched it and realized that its content lowers it to a PG-13 rating. First of all, if your first experience of musicals in concert was with Les Miserables, the actors do not stand up and walk over to microphones to sing. Instead, it is more of a staged version of the show except with no sets, very few colorful costumes,(the only colorful clothes in the show are Johanna's white dress and Judge Turpin's mauve bathrobe), only key props (they'd have to be crazy not to have Sweeney's razor.) and a bloodred stage. To lower the sight of the throat slitting, the victims (in the Trio in the second act) are wrapped in blood red capes.My favorite parts are the recurring song, The Ballad of Sweeney Todd, the scenes where the Beggar Woman wants to have sex with Anthony, Sweeney's Epiphany (George Hearn's performance of that song is breathtaking and amazing), the part where Judge Turpin says, ""When I offered myself to her (Johanna), she showed a certain...reluctance (naturally there was laughter from the audience because who wants to marry their parents)"", the scene where Toby pulls off his wig, and Mrs. Lovett's line after Epiphany: ""That's all very well."" It shows that she's something of a bimbo. I also liked how the bake oven is represented by a blood red curtain.My favorite songs would have to be (in the order that they appear in) The Ballad of Sweeney Todd (and its numerous reprises), No Place Like London, The Barber and His Wife, Poor Thing, Green Finch and Linnet Bird, Johanna (all three versions), Pirelli's Miracle Elixir (because of the incessant reference to a certain excrement made by Sweeney), that song where Pirelli blackmails Todd only to pay his own price (can anyone tell me the name of that song?), Pretty Women (and its reprise), Epiphany, A Little Priest (and its reprise), God, That's Good, By The Sea (and its reprise), Not While I'm Around (and its reprise), and Parlor Songs.I was a little confused on the last two times when Sweeney slit his last two throats. When Sweeney slits his first, third, and fourth throat, the camera zooms in so much that it blurs. After the last two throat slittings, after the picture came back to normal, the bodies were nowhere to be found. This is my first complaint. My second complaint is Lisa Vroman's acting. My third is how at first, The Worst Pies in London will seem like yelling, and finally, Image Entertainment has again made it an annoying tradition to have no track cameras at the foot of the stage. Hello, Image, anybody home? The orchestra is onstage. Maybe, they just have tradition or maybe the stages are constructed to close to the audience or maybe all the shows they film have orchestra pits too close to the first row.All in all, in the words of a certain character from Austin Powers in Goldmember, ""This one's a keeper."" You should get it. You will love it from the first chords of the organ to the end. And check out the Making Of featurette on the DVD.",Sweeney Todd in Concert

699373,"Swamp Girl is an excellent movie, which I would give 4 stars on its own.  Swamp Country is not as good and would get 3 stars on its own.  Both movies are low budget films made to be shown at southern U.S. drive-ins, but deserve a wider audience.  Getting the two movies together on one dvd with all the extras earns them the elevation to 5 stars.Swamp Girl is a really fun movie with great characters and even greater locations.  Although the print is a bit scratchy at times, the shots of the swamp are magnificent, and you actually feel like you're there in a hostile but beautiful environment, a sense that you don't get with the occassional helicopter shots of the outskirts of swamps you sometimes see in big budget pictures. No, these movies take place in wild, untamed regions.  I don't want to spoil the fun of learning how the Swamp Girl wound up being raised in the swamp, or give away any of the fun twists, but you will get to see her go up against nature, progress, rednecks, and an escaped female prisoner and her boyfriend while making use of the swamp environment.Swamp Country is about a man wrongfully accused of a murder escaping into the swamp until he can clear up his name (there's also a brief subplot about a musician being kidnapped, and a love quadrangle).  This film also has some great shots of the swamp and great characters, and is filled with some excellent, catchy tunes (very Johnny Cash).  Unforturnately it is longer than it should be and drags in places, otherwise I'd give it a higher rating, but it is still worthwhile viewing for fans of old B movies (it was made around 1971, but has the feeling of a low budget crime short from the 1940s).Swamp Virgin is an old short from the 1940s using the story of a love triangle as an excuse to show extremely interesting footage of one method used to catch alligators (have a young boy tied to a rope swim out into the swamp in order to attract them (he must be a good swimmer), pull him back to shore before he can be harmed, then shoot the alligator).  Swamp Virgin is filled with excellent underwater photography and may have had a good budget for its time.  Plus there is a swamp buggy race (very interesting contraptions, and each looks completely different) and trailers to such swamp-related classics as ""Attack of the Giant Leeches"" and ""The Alligator People"" from the days when they knew how to make fun trailers.Don't expect any true masterpieces, but you do get over 3 1/2 hours of films filled with quicksand, snakes, alligators, bears, wild cats, mobsters, rednecks, music, southern accents and all sorts of other fun stuff.",N/A
384929,"I can remember seeing USED CARS in its original theatrical run, and I can remember laughing at the assortment of characters that Robert Zemickis and Bob Gale (the uberlords behind BACK TO THE FUTURE and the writers of the vastly underappreciated 1941) somehow managed to create and gel into such a riotious romp.  Kurt Russell is brilliant as Rudy Russo, the car salesman politician wannabe who manages to steal your heart while reaching for your wallet.  Jack Warden, in two roles as twin brothers, is absolutely hilarious.If you look closely, you'll also see some familiar faces that sprinkled the silver screen in 1941 and the BACK TO THE FUTURE trilogy.As for the disc's quality, the digital transfer to widescreen preservation is nicely done, as are some of the extras.  The outtakes are jumbled, however, with absolutely no introductions, explanations, or humor.  We've all seen funnier outtakes at the end of Jackie Chan pictures or on 'America's Funniest Adlibs.'But, the entertainment factor remains high on this picture, despite the fact that it's 20 years old!The only disappointment is that it was Dolby 2.0 mastered, so there are some snippets of dialogue that don't come through as clearly as more current DVD releases.",Used Cars VHS
705921,"World War II has been tagged by some with the rather oxymoronic appellation ""the last good war.""  What this means is that the ""heroes"" and ""villains"" in this epic conflict were so clear-cut and obvious - and the goals so straightforward and crucial - that filmmakers approaching the subject haven't needed to bother much with exploring the moral complexities that lie at the root of all war, that most inhumane of human endeavors.  Films set in World War II have almost invariably reflected a sense of moral certitude, with the Allied nations seen as the forces of Good locked in a life-and-death struggle with the forces of Evil represented by the Axis powers.This is not, of course, the way Americans came, for the most part, to view the Vietnam War.  Faced with no clearly defined enemy or menace, many Americans came to question their country's involvement in what seemed from a distance to be a civil war between two alien nations and cultures.  Thus, when it finally came time for filmmakers to address this issue, their films naturally reflected much of the moral ambiguity that defined the nation as a whole.  Films like ""The Deer Hunter,"" ""Platoon,"" ""Apocalypse Now"" etc. not only questioned the moral rightness of our involvement and actions in that conflict, but actually made us question whether heroism - on the scale of the common soldier caught in the conflict - was even a valid possibility.The new film, ""We Were Soldiers"" attempts to rectify that skepticism, trying to counterbalance the films like those listed above, while at the same time serving as a long overdue and honorable tribute to the brave young men who fought and died doing their duty on that strange foreign soil.  The film, thereby, endeavors to bring the WWII war film sensibility to one set in Vietnam.  In order to focus our attention on the individual heroism of the men involved, the film first has had to drain the narrative of its entire sociopolitical context.  Since this is the story of the first major battle between the Americans and the Viet Cong - in November 1965 - one would naturally expect to hear quite a bit of discourse - both among the military leaders and the rank-and-file combat soldiers - as to the why and wherefore of both the conflict and the Americans' reason for taking part in it.  Yet, we get none of this.  All the soldiers involved simply do their duty without question, an attitude which becomes, in effect, the film's operative definition of the word ""heroism.""  This is what separates ""We Were Soldiers"" from those previous Vietnam War films.  The characters in those other movies were also dying bravely, but they always seemed to be questioning the powers-that-be that got them into the situation in the first place.  In ""We Were Soldiers,"" no one ever questions.  The need to follow orders is simply accepted as a given - and thus heroism becomes a matter of doing one's duty and of helping one's comrade regardless of any overarching justification for the slaughter.  Without having to wade through all the moral murkiness of the conflict itself, we are thus freed up to admire the sheer courage and determination of the men.  In fact, the film even makes a few good willed nods in the direction of equanimity by showing that even the Viet Cong fighters, who are attempting to kill all these fine young American men, also have girlfriends and families they love back home.Given this self-imposed myopia, ""We Were Soldiers,"" nevertheless, does an admirable job honoring these men.  Like most war movies, so much time is spent on the pyrotechnics of battle that little time is left to engage in any real character development.  ""We Were Soldiers"" attempts to flesh out its characters in the opening stretch when we see several of the men with their wives and families before embarking on their mission.  But once they hit the ground in Vietnam, all hell breaks loose and most of the men become lost in the chaos of this seemingly interminable battle.  The film does a terrific job recreating the horror of the fighting, never flinching from the grim reality that is war.  The carnage is appropriately gruesome and the filmmakers make sure that we see every last bit of the grotesquerie that the act of unbridled human butchery has to offer.  The special effects team has done an extraordinary job bringing all this to life on the screen.Although a few of the early family scenes seem treacly at best, some of the film's most profoundly moving moments occur back home, when Julia Moore (Madeleine Stowe), the wife of the film's protagonist, Lt. Colonel Hal Moore (Mel Gibson), takes it upon herself to deliver the ""death telegrams"" to the other wives on the base.Gibson does an admirable job as the man in charge of the mission, displaying both a rugged strength and a compassionate love for his men that makes him a well-rounded character.  One appreciates the fact that the writers, Joseph L. Galloway and Harold G. Moore himself (upon whose life and book this true story is based) don't require Moore to indulge in the kind of cheap theatrical heroics common to characters of this type.  He is a man whose level-headedness and grace under fire help lead his men on to victory in an almost impossible situation.  This is also a rare instance in which a character is allowed to have a religious dimension without being made into a fool in the process.Randall Wallace, as the film's director, seems equally at home in the battle sequences and in the quieter moments of subtle sadness that permeate the scenes at home.""We Were Soldiers,"" for all its simplicity of theme, manages to be a moving tribute to the young men who found the personal courage to put their lives on the line, with or without a cause that made any sense.",N/A
302289,"Joan Crawford said that the role of the nurse, Louise, in ""Possessed"" was the most emotionally and psychologically demanding she undertook in her long career. This is a satisfying potboiler of a 1940s movie with themes of love (of course!),jealousy, guilt, obsession and murder.  Crawford's Louise is a calm, quiet, very competent and tactful nurse whose foiled love affair unbalances her to the core.

687893,"Twin Peaks, the intense, bizarre, and darkly humorous masterpiece television series by David Lynch and Mark Frost, may have only been on the air for a little over a year, but it changed the course of TV history.  In the short run, it caused a nationwide sensation as the whole country grappled with the maddeningly convoluted question of who killed Laura Palmer.  ....For those who don't know what the pilot is about, in short summary Pete Martell, who runs a local Twin Peaks sawmill, discovers popular high school student Laura Palmer's body by a lake.  ""She's dead, Harry.  Wrapped in plastic.""  The remainder of the pilot is set during the course of this tragic Friday, as we are introduced to the characters of Twin Peaks and the surreal environment they inhabit.  Agent Cooper of the FBI drives into town to join the investigation after a second raped girl, Ronette Pulaski, is discovered wandering across state lines.  Blame for the murder originally focuses on slacker Bobby Briggs, then on biker James Hurley.  As the pilot unfolds, we learn about the bewildering number of adulterous relationships, backhanded scheming, and criminal undercurrents that define the dark mystique of this wooded paradise.There is a bonus in store for Twin Peaks fans - the pilot concludes with the ORIGINAL TELEVISION ENDING, something which until now was almost impossible to find anywhere.  This allows the pilot to flow right into Episode 1 of the Artisan box set, which should be a pleasant development for Twin Peaks collectors.As far as the quality of the DVD itself goes, the picture is superior to its VHS and LD predecessors, although nowhere near on par with the Artisan set.  The sound, though leaves something to be desired.  Although the sound is reasonably crisp, the mixing was less than perfect.  Some have also pointed out that the pilot may have been dubbed from PAL (it is from Asia) - this means that a conversion to NTSC resulted in a slight two to three percent speeding up of the sound and picture.  There have been complaints that this changed the pitch of the music and made Agent Cooper sound overly nasal, but the results are minimal and easily overlooked.  Besides, many networks already do this on purpose to squeeze in more advertisenments, and most people don't seem to notice.  Not that I'm defending it, but I can live with the results for now.Would I love to see Paramount or Warner Bros. release the pilot domestically?  Absolutely!  But in the meantime, this is an indespensable partner to the Artisan box set.  I give it four stars only because the DVD quality COULD be better, but the pilot itself is worth at least six stars!",N/A
589321,"This film is a thought provoking, intelligent, and all around amazing experience. It amazes me that this was given a mainstream release by Paramount, and I only wish that they would continue to take more risks like this once in a while, because here, the payoff is beautiful. Tom Cruise delivers one of his best performances to date as David Aames, an egotistical playboy who inherited a fortune from his father, and takes everything in his life for granted, until his life suddenly takes a turn for the bizarre. This film is about one man's journey to redemption through a series of dreams, scientific miracles, and the power of love.I personally believe that this is Cameron Crowe's best, after ALMOST FAMOUS. Why this film did not connect with audiences and critics is the most baffling thing for me to grasp. Cruise totally dives into this role (he also produced the film, which is based on a foreign film, ABRE LOS OJOS), and the rest of the supporting cast is perfect as well. Penelope Cruz will take your breath away with her fully realized performance as Sofia, Jason Lee is amazing as a heartbroken novelist, and Cameron Diaz gives what may be her best performance of all time as lonely, psychotic Juliana. The soundtrack is to die for, and perfectly compliments the mood of the film.This is a beautiful film. It is a celebration of life, and how ""every passing minute is a chance to turn it all around"". I watched this film in theatres years ago, and it made a huge impression on me. I've watched it twice since yesterday.For those of you who may be skeptical, ignore the negative reviews and watch the film for yourself. Let it wash over you. You won't regret it.",Vanilla Sky VHS
92445,"""The Color Purple"" has so many messages, moral and otherwise, that they blur together into what can only be described as wisdom. As an Australian I can't claim to know a lot about the black experience in the south, in the early 20th century. Despite that, I get a strong sense of realism from this film, in the same way we are forced to believe someone when they admit a degrading fact about themselves.The heart of this movie is a woman named Celie. Woopie Goldberg was cast in the role and it represents her first cinematic outing. She was nominated for an  Academy Award and, in my opinion, should have won it. Celie doesn't get to talk much, is subservient to many of the larger powers in her life and yet still manages to communicate depths of emotion few of us ever see in our own lives.Our sympathies go out to Celie from the start, when we see her as a child playing in a meadow with her sister, Nettie. Hidden at first, her pregnancy is soon revealed, as the result of an incestuous rape. Celie, still a child, is soon separated from her own offspring, for the second time and then torn apart from her sister, as Celie is consigned to her new husband. Married life becomes another form of servitude, including the same chores, sexual abuse and mental anguish but  without her sister's love. Nettie somehow gets shipped of to Africa, as a nanny to some missionaries. We only see enough of her life to know that it is a rich and fulfilling one, in stark contrast to Celie's.Celie has a strange and extended family. Her husband, Albert, called only ""Mister"" by Celie, is a petty and deliberately cruel man. He seems to sense that there is more value in Celie than he will ever possess and thus never stints in holding his power over her. Albert's mistress, Shug Avery, is a degraded yet stylish club singer who eventually loves Celie more than Albert. He was never more than a passing convenience to Shug. Albert has a son from a previous marriage, Harpo. For some reason, the strongest character in the film, Sofia, played very convincingly by Oprah Winfrey, decides she is going to marry Harpo and does just that. In many ways, Sofia's rude  awakening to the realities of her world, at the hands of the local mayor, his wife and the police, is sadder than Celie's plight. After all, Celie never had hopes or expectations to lose.As the story progresses, Celie starts to emerge from her cocoon. Helped in part by her husband's mistress. She becomes aware of her own inner beauty and her own power. This transformation is so gradual that we almost believe nothing is changing but by the end of the film, Celie is a woman in control of her own destiny and a force for good in her community. We are not asked to believe that patience is all that is required to overcome evil. Celie has her fair share of confrontations and setbacks. Instead we learn that even the palest plant, deprived of sunlight all its life, may eventually blossom into something special. All it may need is a little encouragement.I don't watch The Color Purple as regularly as some of the other films in my collection. It is hard going in spots. But, if you ever start feeling a little sorry for yourself, I recommend this movie. Not only will it put your troubles into proper perspective but it will also lift up your heart as few films can.",N/A

212626,"Though lacking the philosophical depth of The Motion Picture, and the heart-pounding action of The Wrath of Khan, Star Trek III: The Search for Spock ultimately succeeds because it's primarily a character driven story, which recalls the best episodes of the original series. Spock's resurrection is handled convincingly--no magical regeneration with a shiny blue animated line here. In all aspects, Leonard Nimoy does a fine job in his directorial debut--he can clearly handle a camera and brings forth strong performances from his actors.  Robin Curtis more than holds her own in the role of Lt. Saavik, originally portrayed by Kirstie Alley.  The consistently underrated William Shatner shines here, giving a performance which is by turns somber and impassioned.  DeForest Kelley also deserves praise as the Spock-possessed McCoy.Most of the special effects have held up well over the years, and the few that haven't are not overly distracting. Star Trek has never been beholden to special effects, but has generally relied upon character development and story--and this emphasis has served it well over the years.The picture is identical to the first DVD issue, which improved on both the VHS and Laser Disc issues--the colors are more vibrant and crisper. The sound also has more impact than the earlier versions.This is one of the few films where the theatrical cut WAS the director's cut, so there are no added scenes here.  The commentary by Nimoy and the rest is interesting and informative, as is Michael Okuda's text commentary.  The cast interviews, as always, are entertaining, although I would have liked to have heard more of what REALLY happened during the infamous 1983 fire at Paramount studios.  Less entertaining are the featurettes on terraforming, the Klingon language, and the visual effects, which contain almost no behind the scenes footage.",N/A

There were really no redeeming qualities to this movie, whatsoever, although Steve Buscemi is as entertaining as usual.  Between the wooden acting, terrible editing and absolutely inane dialogue, this dog seemed to drag on much longer than the published run time.Banderas and Gugnio seem to be almost embarassed when delivering their lines, and, although the child actors seem to hold some talent, the situations they are put in and the weak writing give them no chance to deliver ...I must say, I've been to a dozen or so kids' movies over the last couple of years, and this is the first time the theater has been absolutely silent.

715994,"Escanaba in Da Moonlight is a hysterical film about the traditions of deer hunters, and one family's bizarre ordeal on the opening day of deer season.The first film in actor/director Jeff Daniels' Purple Rose film company, which will make films exclusively in his home state of Michigan, Escanaba in Da Moonlight is a gem of a comedy. And while the humor will especially hit home for residents of Michigan's Upper Peninsula (The Superior state, as they call it), and those living in other &quot;deer country&quot; states such as Wisconsin and Minnesota, this movie has plenty of laughs for everyone.Centering on the Soady family on their annual cabin trip the first day of deer season, the film explores the trials and tribulations of the &quot;buckless yupper,&quot; Reuben Soady, (Jeff Daniels).Now, fair warning, this movie gets pretty bizarre. Among the occurrences the Soady family has on its day of hunting are UFO's, a government agent gone mental, possession and Native American superstitions.But all the insanity leads to big laughs. And it doesn't let up until near the end, where the only flaw lies. The film crosses the line of becoming too sentimental, offering too much cheese. If Daniels toned it down a bit at the end, the film would have been perfect.But the film is still a highly enjoyable look at the world of the &quot;U.P.&quot; (The Upper Peninsula), and is worth multiple viewings. Make it a tradition to watch this on the opening day of deer season. It's well worth it.",Escanaba in Da Moonlight

496975,"Hart's War isn't unwatchable, but it isn't good either.Why Bruce Willis is the primary actor listed in the credits speaks more to his declining fame than his role in this film (typically an actor who receives top billing does so for a reduction in salary).Midway through this WWII potboiler, I expected to hear the theme music from ""Hogan's Heros"" and have the actors visages flash up on the screen. Hogan's Heros was a comedic take on a serious and excellent film: Stalag 17. Hart's War incorporates aspects of Stalag 17 and then adds in parts of To Kill A Mockingbird for good measure. Based on a book, I suppose I'm also critiquing that novel's content as well.So what's my critique? How could I not like a film (and book) that are so politcally relevant and emotionally draining as a story of white and black prejudice set against an even greater evil of Naziism? Oh, puleese!I thought I was going to see a fair to good WWII drama, but then I was duped by the filmmakers into a racism drama that typically casts the poor put upon black man in a role that he can do nothing but become a hero as a result of circumstances put upon him. Don't get me wrong - black men have been dealt a poor hand for a long time, but this film doesn't cover new territory and it doesn't tell a story that is unique: it feels stale and overcooked. The black character at the heart of this story could have just as well been cast and written as an American Indian, a Jew, a homosexual, or any other minority group and it would have worked as effectively.If it seems that I am a bit ticked off - you'd be right. I don't have a problem with the role of prejudice being identified and played on in a film, but it doesn't have to be handled in some a heavy and ham-handed way as Hart's War lays it out.Our narrator is apparently some sort of saint (but he is also a bit of a coward in that he gives up U.S. secrets for his own safety - a plot point which dies on the vine in lieu of the racist subject matter) because he's the only white man in the entire prison camp who isn't a racist.The characters in this film are sketches - two dimensional sketches. They are either good or they are bad. No one has multi-layered personalities. The camp bigot is not only a bigot but he is a traitor! The captain is not only a hardcase, but he has ulterior motives that may be bigotry and probably include selling out the camp saint in addition to the black man. The narrator (saint), though he committed treasonous acts, is to be completely forgiven because he is in support of the camp's only black resident. People are not all bad and people are not all good. There are many a murderer out there who are extremely good to their mothers, but who would gun you down without thinking twice.Surprisingly, the Nazis don't come off as hideously evil as the typical Hollywood film would portray them. The Commandant of the camp is intelligent and suspicious, and even a bit self-serving, but that would be expected in war. The Nazis are actually cast more believable than any of the Americans.I would love to see Hollywood address racism with more subtly than this. I think it is a point that deserves attention, but I think that we have also moved beyond the point when it has to be shoved down our throats as Hart's War does.Photograhed beautifully, and yet not unlike Stalag 17 and Hogan's Heros (it's always winter in these prison camp shows - you know Germany is actually quite beautiful in the summer - you'd think that such a contrast might sometime be brought out in these war pictures), Hart's War is sadly a poor rehash of material previously covered in Stalag 17 and To Kill A Mockingbird.",Hart's War

310047,"I first saw 'On Her Majety's Secret Service' while I was a teenager in the 70s. I had always been very curious about it, having seen the record soundtrack in stores, but never the film itself (either in theaters or on television) or hearing my friends speak of it. In the 1970s when a local theater ran it on a double bill with another Bond film (I think it was showing with 'Diamonds Are Forever') I was finally able to satisfy my curiosity. I was awestruck. Great story, great cast, fantastic stunts and breathtaking aerial cinematography. I tried to convince my friends that this was one of the best Bond films, but they all shrugged it off since Connery was absent. After a while I started to believe them, but some years later I caught it on ABC (I think it was the TV premiere) and quickly I was reassured that I had been right all along. This was among the handful of the truly great Bond films!!! I'll agree, though that had Connery been in the starring role, this would be unanimously regarded as THE greatest Bond film, but Lazenby is not bad as Bond, and in fact portrays 007 with a degree of uncertainty and vulnerability which gives the story a lot of its heart. Diana Rigg and Telly Savalas give superb performances and the production is nearly flawless. Still, sadly, the Connery comparison persists making this probably the greatest 'but what if...' motion picture ever!!",N/A
449648,"This movie stays with you forever because it has unforgettable characters. Scarlett and Rhett, the main characters are strong, dynamic engrossing personalities. Many other unforgettables include Mammy, Aunt Pitty, Melanie, and of course Prissy. These characters come together magnificently to form the greatest movie of all time. This story is about the Ole South and its downfall and reconstruction and how it changed the lives of the people involved. It's inspirational because Scarlett shows much courage in dealing with adversities and is determined to rise above hardships no matter what the cost. It's also a great love story between Scarlett and Rhett who are like souls made for each other. Rhett knows this immediately but Scarlett doesn't catch on until much later.  There's a lot of excitement and energy in this movie and it draws you in emotionally and never lets go. It's courageous, humorous, tragic and sometimes all of these things at once. The casting of Clark Gable as Rhett and Vivien Leigh as Scarlett is perfect and could never be improved. This movie was made in 1939 and is still shining brightly for new generations.",N/A

321269,"A generally enjoyable DVD!Die Zauberflote, Mozart's last opera, performed on this disc by the Metropolitan Opera under the direction of James Levine.The cast features such stars as Kathleen Battle (Pamina), Fancisco Araiza (Tamino), Manfred Hemm (Papageno), Kurt Moll  (Sarasto), and Luciana Serra as the Queen of the Night. Brian Large, who has vast experience with opera, directs this major work.This opera showcases the voice and acting skills of Kathleen Battle: she is brilliant, beautiful and with a voice that could only be described as a gift. Also noteworthy are the exquisite vocals by Luciana Serra as the Queen of the Night. However, it is Manfred Hemm as Papageno who steals the spotlight: from beginning to end, his funny interpretation of his character (accompanied by his great voice) carries this work to its fitting conclusion.The only negative comment (thus the loss of one star) was the surreal quality of the sets. Frankly, I thought they were ugly and if anything, detracted from an otherwise stellar performance. Also the overture featured, I felt, a little too much of James Levine: surely, some more shots of the orchestra could have been inserted here somewhere.While The Magic Flute is not my favorite opera by Mozart, this is, all things being considered, an enjoyable performance.

Though it is truly in the style of previous &quot;romance&quot; works, LOTR is one of the only books that truly delves into the sacred and mythical and comes out of the underworld with dignity and a lesson learned.  Peter Jackson and the entire crew of the film version have not hesitated to let themselves be taken away by this truly amazing story and have surrendered to the world that Tolkien created.While the film is honestly quite bombastic and over the top at times, it is quite forgivable.  The story itself is not lost in the minor changes in adaptation, and the film makes up for it in it's ability to vividly re-create Middle-Earth into a colorful and alive place that I am not even capable of imaginging when I read the book.  The film also shortens the rambling tendencies of Tolkien and focuses instead on the story and the characters, bringing to light some parts of the book that may not be so clear.This first Lord of the Rings film does what a film adaptation should do: it takes direct inspiration from the book and makes a masterpiece that is true to the original, yet stands on it's own as a brilliant and transcendently beautiful work of art.

668557,"Strictly put, SERIES 7: THE CONTENDERS, is an incredible independent film that follows the immoral trail that we're creating with our current television.Even though it was written well before TV hits like Survivor and Temptation Island, SERIES 7 works even better as it now has a basis to see just how ludicrous television is becoming.  It was shot like a reality television series with cameras following all participants, therefore making it even more realistic.  However, it takes it a step furthur and introduces a RUNNING MAN type senario where the contestants of the game show are almost literally thrown Glock pistols and sent out to kill each other.  The direction of all of this is extremely realistic, sometimes frighteningly so.  One of my friends actually walked in when I was watching the movie and asked what channel the show was on.  Daniel Minahan has done a great job keeping the action realistic and intense.  The ""conversation"" scenes where the characters are talking to the camera are very well done and exude a certain type of ground while being hilarious because of the things that everyone is saying.At times, the acting is a little cheesy, but this is easily overlooked.  The main actors do a fine job and it's interesting to see how the large supporting cast interacts with them when the cameras are turned onto them.  It all comes down to the big question of, ""Am I on yet?"" whenever they appear on screen.  It basically plays like a more serious Jerry Springer episode.Minahan should be congratulated for the job he has done here.  This film is very well thought out and very scary when you think about the path that or current television veiwing habits are heading.  Despite a rather falty ending, SERIES 7: THE CONTENDERS, is a well crafted satirical thriller and should be seen by everyone who hates reality TV as well as those who endorse it.",SERIES 7-CONTENDERS

Had the director made some admission of this fact on the DVD cover, I would have felt better about the film (maybe he has done so elsewhere).  If he has, I would then be quite happy to withdraw my criticism.Thomas Seay",Beijing Bicycle
188025,"This is an amazing film to watch. Not only is it beautifully filmed but the atmosphere is quite vivid in its' depiction of a Japanese servant girl who becomes mistress of the master of the house and sexually obsessed with their relationship. She leads him deeper into the sexual realm until it becomes the focus of both their lives. Their relationship becomes so intense that it can only lead to destruction. Film is extremely sexually graphic and to be honest, I wasn't even aware that I was watching ""pornography"" because the acting and story were so mesmerizing. By then, I didn't care because it wasn't offensive---just honest. The two leads are wonderful actors and they made me forget I was watching a supposedly one-time controversial film. The film is supposedly based on a true incident. The ending is shocking and depressing but that's allegedly what happened. I consider this film a classic and a must see for foreign film buffs. It's one of the most beautiful erotic love stories ever made and one of the most disturbing.",In the Realm of the Senses

The story-line captivates my 2-year old and 5-year old, they love the music, and they laugh and giggle at some of the antics.  I highly recommend these tapes.

Based on Capcom's ""Street Fighter"", this film is about a warlord who wants billions of dollars and world domination. So, M. Bison (the late Raul Julia) takes innocent people hostage and demands for his requests to be met. Unfortunately for him, Guile will not obey the wide-eyed psychopath and asks him on international televion, 'hamanee doctors and nurses have you killed?' and 'hamanee children have you orphaned this week Bison?"". It was chronicle! Guile's friend has been taken by the lunatic and Bison changes him into a fighting mutant! Carlos Blanca's life will never be the same. Oh well, enough of that soppy story. Back to action! Guile gathers all of his men and recruits a nosy reporter, a sumo wrestler, a boxer and two brothers who look nothing alike! Considering there is no street fighting what so ever in this mammoth production, Van Damme managed to impress me once again with his lordage. He fought Bison with roundhouse kicks, jumpkicks, his trademark 360* kick and the flash kick! YES, genius! Aside from the monumental superbeing, he saves the world and makes this the best video game movie ever. Forget ""Mortal Kombat"" or ""Super Mario Bros.""

Jack Black does a great job as Hal and Gwyneth Paltrow does an awesome job as 300 pound Rosemary. This movie is filled with genuine laughs.Shallow Hal starts off when Hal is a little kid and his mom and him are in the hospital because Hal's father is dying. Hal is the only one that witnesses his fathers death. Then the movie goes to the older Hal dancing at a club, trying to get women bt he's just to shallow. A little bit later he gets stuck in an elevator with this therapist guy who puts a spell on Hal that makes him less shallow by letting him only see the inner beauty of someone. right when he leaves he gets in a cab with this pretty woman who actually talks to him. He asks her if shes here for a model show and she starts laughing and is like ""Yeah Right"". He gets her number and hes happy.The next day he sees this beautiful woman who is pretty skinny walking into a store and he follows her.

It's one of those period pieces with costumes and sailing ships and beautiful British scenery, with a plot that had a lot to do with girls giggling together.  All of these Emily Austen, or Jane Bronte or whatever shows seem to be film adaptations of books penned by young English women about young English women encountering inspirational experiences for books they are penning.Guys, if you want to make your girl happy, then obtain this film and watch it with her... and be attentive, cheerful and cordial while doing so.  She will enjoy the experience, and will be quite pleased with you.  If you can do so with no problems, have a liter of good wine handy, and sip it steadily throughout the movie.  Wine won't convert this Major Chick Flick to Vertical Limit, but a sufficient quantity of it will make the Mansfield Park experience tolerable for a typical ordinary guy.",Mansfield Park VHS
18924,"Think `Carrie'. Think her at school but without her telekinetic powers: this is Dawn, the protagonist of anti-fairy tale movie, `Wellcome To The Dollhouse"", directed by Todd Solondz .For Dawn, High School is hell. She has no friends, she is neither cute, nor popular. Everybody makes fun of her. One boy threatens to rape her, he says ""Be here at 3"", and she is there, but he is not interested in her any more. At home, things are not very different. Her parents don't care about her. They got eyes only for her little sister, who is too polite, too smart, too cute -- too hatefull -- and for her older brother, a kind of genius who is only worried about his curriculum and his stupid nerd band. Even when she falls in love, we have to addmit, she is ignored either.That is Dawn's world. And she doesn't care about it. Nor Solondz. He doesn't want to give us a lecture, saying to love everybody, even the strange girl. Moreover, his work says ""This is life, whether you like it or not!"" And this a concept that he explored much more in his lattest movies `Happiness' (1998) and `Storytelling'(2002). He has a special interest in the bizarre without making it grotesque. His films are not made to laugh out loud, they make you give pale smilles.It seems to me that the only one who have any good feeling for Dawn is the audience. It is impossible not to feel tempted to `get inside' the movie, shake her and say ""Wake up, girl! They don't like you. Forget about them."" But nobody does it. She has to move on living, despite all the limitations of her life.Who says that had never met someone like Dawn at school --or anywhere else-- is lying! She is the kind of person who is around everywhere. And almost everybody ignores them. Everybody but Todd Solondz --who himself looks very alike this kind of person-- and made a wonderful movie about his strange and peculiar universe.",N/A
424161,"Here is yet another example of an excellent non-science fiction MST3K episode.Here's the deal:After an opening credit sequence featuring John Carradine belching out the theme song, Coleman Francis stars as Griffin, an escaped felon who teams up with two illegal tire-changers named Cook and Landis.  After they bond over beans and coffee, the trio decide to join up with the local army to invade Cuba.  They hire a rather uncharismatic fellow named Cherokee Jack (""I'm Cherokee Jack"") to fly them to the military base.  After the absolute worst training session in history, which consisted of wrestling, climbing a rope and jumping off a cliff, the impressive force leave for Cuba.  The riveting beach landing scene is a close second to Saving Private Ryan's as far as intensity goes (uhhh...not really).  As the invasion force of 8 guys gets picked off one by one by the Cubans, led by a faux-Castro in the worst fake beard of all time, Griffin, Cook and Landis are captured along with their injured ""friend"" Sergeant Justine (Chastain, actually).  They have to spend time in a little shack with ""Viva Cuba"" scrawled on the wall (so you know it's really Cuba), and all the while watch their fellow soldiers get paint thrown in their faces.  After an ingenius plan to strangle the guard that gives them a bowl full of water, the guys escape and fly in a plane back to good ole US of A, leaving Justine behind.  When they get back home, they track down Justine's wife, who rather naively gives them directions to and offers to help them with the plunder of the family's tungsten mine.  Cook and Landis are captured by the cops, Griffin and Mrs. Justine are shot, and Justine himself makes a triumphant return, only to find his dead wife in the back of a pick-up truck.  A dark, dark movie, is this one.I really love Mike and Bots treatment of this one.  It is so disjointed and mistake-riddled, that it must be hard to sit through, but somehow they manage it, and make it my favorite episode in the process.  Much like Mitchell, I think the fact that the main characters are so loathsome, that the writers cruelty was unfettered.  A true classic.",Mystery Science Theater 3000 - Red Zone Cuba VHS

I have no working knowledge of the original but many people have told me that it does in fact stay true to the original plots and characters.

541965,"Before Christopher Nolan would be tapped to direct a remake of 2002's Insomnia, he directed this modest budgeted thriller that sets bold new standards in mystery and suspense cinema.  Guy Pearce (Ravenous) plays a man named Leonard Shelby who is searching for the man that raped and murdered his wife.  That alone is pretty much the plot, but what sets Memento apart from other revenge themed thrillers is the fact that the film moves backwards event wise.  The film starts out from the end and works it's way back to the beginning, letting the viewer find out not just how something happened, but why it happened.  Memento is presented in this form due to the fact that Leonard suffers from a condition received when his wife was attacked that stops his brain from making new memories.  Lenny can't remember faces, names, locations, or anything else on his own so he takes Polaroid photos, writes endless amounts of organized notes, and even makes himself home made tattoos.  Pearce is simply unbelieveable in his role as the tortured soul Lenny, while Joe Pantoliano (The Matrix, tv's The Sopranos) almost steals Pearce's thunder as Teddy, a man who may or may not be on Lenny's side.  Carrie-Anne Moss (another Matrix alumnus) plays a sympathetic soul to Lenny's crisis while hiding ulterior motives, and she gives a knockout performance as well.  Memento requires more than one viewing to fully understand the complex storyline, but once you do you'll be left with your jaw on the floor.  All in all, those looking for something delightfully different and intelligent should definitely give Memento a well deserved look.",Memento VHS

396609,"After more than four years MST3k finally took on Joe Don Baker with Mitchell. Obviously a beefed up TV pilot, Mitchell has Joe Don as the only cop in his station who sees the relevance in clues Inspector Clousseau couldn't have missed (Mitchell: ""The gun collection was high up on the wall and the burglar only looks about five four."" Mitchell's boss: ""Well, what does that mean?"") He's also a fat, alcoholic, porn-reading slob. I really can't believe anyone thought the public could get behind a hero like this. He goes up against Martin Balsam (a long way from the foreman in 12 Angry Men) as a drug peddler whose house is being staked out. This means about two-thirds of the movie is just Mitchell sitting in his car watching the guy. The whole thing ends with a near shot-for-shot ripoff of Key Largo, and Mitchell returns to his house to find the hooker he's been sleeping with the whole time. After sleeping with her one more time (yuck!) he finds some pot in her coat and arrests her. Man, double standard zero tolerance is so funny, huh? Oh, and there's also a 25 MPH ""car chase"", and a truly surreal encounter with a little kid where both of them endlessly repeat the other. No riffs are needed here, Tom screaming his head off is enough. The host segments are great too, with Joel finally escaping the SOL in the aptly named escape pod Deus Ex Machina. Down in Deep 13, a temp worker named Mike Nelson helps the Mads out while they're being audited. I see big things in his future. I was surprised at one thing, though: Tom points out that John Saxon seems to disappear from the film, but one of the scenes that they cut from the show had him being killed!

Call me heartless or what you will, but I would feel nothing (but fustration) if my computer's hard drive failed no matter how inspiring the daily quotes it spits out are.It is obvious that this kid was not programmed to love - unconditionaly that is - but rather was programmed to be insecure about love.

13516,"Chris Sarandon is terrific as Jerry Dandridge, the charming neighborhood vampire. In watching his performance one evening after I bought this tape, I finally understood why it was that the vampire story will never die, no matter how many stakes get driven into its heart: the near-death ecstasy and the orgasmic ecstasy are biochemically identical. Whether it is the act of creating human life or the act of taking it away- the human physical response is the same.  With the tale of the vampire, when the male vampire is in the act of ostensibly making love to his victim, we get both actions [ostensibly giving and taking] the same time.  The raw power of the scene in the book, ""Dracula,"" where the vampire baptizes Mina with his own blood, adds a third element to this powerful biochemical mix: a spiritual element, a religious esctasy.  We don't have this in ""Fright Night"", but instead we have the setting of an entirely normal central character and his friends, in an average town in Anywhere, America.  This ""brings it home"" in an unexpected way, as the spiritual aspect is replaced by a social one.  Context is the difference, one which is exploited very well.  And of course, the struggle of a fatherless boy trying to grow into manhood and the man finds himself fixating on [the vampire] adds another dimension.  The vampire has been a man and moved beyond it; Charley wants to be a man and finds that he is both helpless and threatened by the vampire.  And of course, the vampire is just as helpless under certain conditions and threatened by almost everything in the ordinary daylight world- Charley through the looking glass.Roddy McDowell shines in his role as the washed-up B-movie star.  The supporting cast is also very good.  And the music isn't even bad-- very 80's, but this adds to its charm.",Fright Night

521244,"To this reviewer, Three Kings was the single most neglected movie in this year's Oscar race. The old idea that Academy members have short memories doesn't always work for me. The Matrix, which was released five months prior to Three Kings, got four nominations and four awards. It's true that these were in the less exciting technical areas. Still, I still am upset that Three Kings got zilch. Oh, the humanity!The Gulf War has just ended. Are we victorious? Yes and no. Kuwait is saved. That country will soon be back in the multibillion dollar oil business, and the sheiks and their cronies will get most of their gold and other goodies back. As a military and an economic force, Iraq will be paralyzed for at least a decade. The bad news, as we all know, is that we didn't get the bad guy. Saddam will continue to rule for at least a decade.What we at home, as well as most of the guys and gals in the Armed Forces there, didn't know yet was that our call for the Iraqi people to rise up in rebellion against Saddam was answered in many parts of his county. And then we left. Just packed up and went home. Left the rebels to fend for themselves against a government that was very, very angry. I guess NATO generals decided that chaos was a natural byproduct of war.This is the setting for Three Kings. It could have been a grim movie, but it is not overtly political any more than M.A.S.H was. It doesn't point fingers, and it makes no speeches. It's stance is that the soldiers were just as stunned and confused by the speed and abrupt end to the conflict as the people watching at home were. This was the first modern high-tech war. Conducted primarily through air assaults, it left the majority of the ground troops will little to do. So, this isn't like a Vietnam War flick in which troops are given unbelievable orders from seemingly insane commanders in an unwinnable situation. The Gulf War wasn't about Armageddon. It was about Alice in Wonderland.Major Archie Gates [George Clooney] has been so disgusted by the way the war has been conducted that he's decided to resign. It's back to civilian life in two weeks time. He is most interested when he hears of a map taken from a prisoner. [I can't tell you from where on the prisoner said map was obtained.] The map gives the location of a bunker which contains $23,000,000 in gold bars stolen from Kuwait. Now that could make a nice retirement nest egg, Archie thinks. Soon, he is sets off with a select group on a most unusual heist. One of his comrades is Troy Barlow [Mark Wahlberg]. His wife just had there first baby back in America, and all he cares about is getting home in one piece. There is Chief Elgin [Ice Cube], an Army reservist from Detroit, who is basically on a four month vacation from his job as an airport baggage handler. Finally, we have Conrad Vigs [Spike Jonze, in an absolutely brilliant performance], a bright but virtually uneducated kid from the sticks. At first they are pursed by no one except vigilant CNN-type reporter, Adriana Cruz [Nora Dunn]. All she's after is a good story.Remember that much of Iraq's army was still intact. They still guarded Saddam's stuff, like gold bars and luxuary cars hidden undergrounda. Archie and his co-conspritors don't face a risk-free mission. When they get to the bunker, they discover its in a town whose residents are some of the rebels mentiond earlier. The group decides that it's not their problem. Then something awful happens, and the situation turns ugly - and interesting. Do you get the gold or help the people? Do you do both? Neither? Aside from the problems attached to steeling gold, what do you do if helping these people is in direct violation of NATO orders?I love George Clooney. He's right up there with Bruce Willis in the Most Underrated Actors Hall of Fame. Despite their having come from rock and roll, both Mark Wahlberg and Ice Cube are well know in the movie business as guys who take their acting very seriously. Nora Dunn, veteran of five years with Saturday Night Live, is a delight. I've already commented on Spike Jonze, but I must mention he did this while in preproduction on Being John Malkovich, which he directed. Writer/director David O. Russell brings the very best of his independent film background with him. He has all sorts of tricks he uses effectively with film, sound and camera angles. You've never seen a shootout like the one he creates here, for example. His use of color and of unusual film stock is extraordinary. Everyone involved has madeThree Kings a royal masterpiece.",Three Kings
561716,"Producer Jerry Bruckheimer is one of the most successful people in the movies. He has a formula for action pictures which has been as successful as it has been critic proof. He's the man behind such blockbusters as ConAir, The Rock and Armageddon. Gone in 60 Seconds is his latest production, and even by Bruckheimer standards, it's run-of-the-mill. To his credit, I imagine Mr. B. is the only producer on the planet who could get away with spending [that much money] on a remake of a low budget 1974 movie, but that's exactly what Gone in 60 Seconds is.Memphis Raines [Nicholas Cage] used to be the top auto thief in Los Angeles. When his mother told him his brother Kip [Giovanni Ribisi] was going to turn out just like him, he did the right thing. [""I didn't do it for the money I did it for the cars!"", he exclaims.] He moves to a small town and opens a go-cart track. Well, wouldn't you know it? Kip turns out just like Memphis anyway. Now Kip has made an enemy of Raymond Calitri [Christopher Eccleston], a lowdown Brit who seems to control the grand theft auto market in LA. Raymond gives Memphis a choice: Either steal fifty cars in seventy-two hours or stand by while Kip is whacked. Memphis rounds up some of his old crew. These include his old mentor Freb [Robert Duvall] and his old flame Sara [Angelina Jolie]. Meanwhile, police detective Castlebeck {Delroy Lindo], who regrets he didn't nail Memphis years ago, gets wind of the plan and attempts to stop it. Memphis finds himself squeezed into the middle between the law and the lawless.The story goes from the preposterous to the absurd and back again, but in a Bruckheimer movie, story always takes a back-seat to action. The problem here is that most the action isn't all that exciting. It's rather soulless, with one predictable event following another in a sort of paint by numbers fashion. There is one very well done car chase, but one such scene in this kind of movie is hardly sufficient.Gone in 60 Seconds has three Oscar winning actors among its stars. Sometimes in an otherwise mindless movie, this is a bonus, but not in this case. Nicholas Cage has no character development. He's essentially the same guy he was in ConAir. Angelina Jolie has a very small role, despite the fact she gets second billing. Robert Duvall gets to say a lot of inane dialog with a straight face. These are not stars doing their acting thing. These are three stars just working for a living. I am sure they were paid most sufficiently. They were cast simply as part of the Bruckheimer formula, which says that you've got to have a big name or two above the title. In other words, he believes you can fool many people through conspicuous excessiveness. Usually, but not always, he's right.",Gone in 60 Seconds
472189,"In a film quite reminiscing of the his James Bond adventures, Pierce Brosnan is back as both co-producer and starring role as Thomas Crown, a leader magnate in mergers and acquisitions of the modern day New York. Just because he &#147;likes it&#148; he happens to collect priceless works of art&#133; illegally. Enter super-sexy, beautifully chic and extra smartRene Russo, as the woman who will &#147;get him&#148;, in more ways than one.&#147;The Thomas Crown affair&#148; is a re-make of the film of the same name that Steve McQueen starred in during the sixties. Not having seen that version, I have to admit this one in particular has all the style, glamour and cache of the high life everybody wants to follow but, sadly, not everybody gets. Pierce Brosnan is not a versatile actor, but roles like this, where he can display his slender persona and gallant ways, suit him as a tailored grey flannel ensemble done by the most excellent fashion expert. Speaking of fashion, his counterpart, Rene Russo, surprises and enchants in her Celine wardrobe and Bvlgari jewels. Russo certainly shows off as beautiful as ever and with all the quick wit and classy manners of a female James Bond.No expense in this movie was spared, the rides in Crown&#146;s Jaguar, dinner at Ciprianni&#146;s (with no previous reservation), weekend away in the privacy of one&#146;s own villa in Martinique, windsurfing and more. We all know that the first purpose of the entertainment industry is, precisely, to entertain. What better to do that, than to slip &#147;The Thomas Crown affair&#148; into your VHS or DVD player and relax with a good glass of wine.",The Thomas Crown Affair VHS

397480,"This is the story of two young people trying to find something exciting in the Depression.  In the beginning, we find a bored Bonnie Parker, played by the lovely Faye Dunaway, waiting for her knight to come take her away from small-town Texas.  Along comes Clyde Barrow, played by Warren Beatty, who will whisk her away into a life of robbery.  Together, they will cut a swathe through America's history.The director for the film had a great eye.  Although we are seeing a film about bank robbers, we see the effect on everyone else.  We see the displaced sharing food with them because the robbers don't hurt them, but attack the banks.  We see the sheriffs and bankers posing for pictures because they were involved in the chase for the two robbers.Odd that bank robbers would become heroes, but that is what we see.  We also see the darker side of two people who just wanted some excitement and respect.  For instance, after their first bank robbery goes awry due to a parking problem, Clyde has to kill someone.  As they watch a movie to celebrate, the movie sings ""We're in the Money!"" as the robbers argue amongst themselves.  Crime is not all it is cracked up to be.I would recommend seeing this movie.  This is some great moviemaking.",N/A

It has opened my eyes to a new genre of film! (if not books)&quot;Harry Potter&quot; is a fun, enchanting, and quite involved look into the world of how wizards come to learn the craft, and how they are chosen, and Harry Potter is the main character.Speaking of characters, he comes across some mighty interesting ones in his quest for the stone.I recommend this one for the entire family.  There may be a few close to scary momments for the young ones, but it really is great film that you can safely allow your children to view. It has something everyone can appreciate. Plus, it is fun to watch and the story is easy enough to follow.

596266,"When you combine the talents of superstar Tom Cruise (""Vanilla Sky"", ""Top Gun"") and director Steven Spielberg (""A.I."", ""Jurassic Park""), there's nothing that can stop them from bringing a great film to the big screen, and ""Minority Report"" is no exception whatsoever! I have seen this film twice at the theater and I can't get enough of it! We have seen Spielberg give us some extraordinary classics, such as ""Jaws"", ""E.T."", the ""Indiana Jones"" films, and ""Jurassic Park"", and a questionable film such as ""A.I. Artificial Intelligence"". But now, Spielberg has certainly outdone himself with ""Minority Report"", a film loaded with action and thrills galore, powerful drama, and cutting edge special effects that only Industrial Light & Magic (ILM) can provide us with! And as far as the performance from Tom Cruise goes, it was a performance that couldn't be better! Possibly the best Cruise performance since the ""Mission: Impossible"" films! ""Minority Report"" takes place in Washington, DC in the year 2054. There is a new brand of law enforcement called the Department of Precrime. Precrime uses psychics called ""Pre-Cogs"" to help the officers see the perpetrator committing his/her crime and to stop them before it is actually committed. As for Precrime chief John Anderton (Cruise), he is among those that believes in this system being perfect and that it is never wrong...until now! Shockingly, as it turns out, Anderton is being set up for a murder that he didn't even commit! And so begins an action-packed journey as Anderton races against time to clear his name, reclaim his life, and to find out who framed him and why. In closing, ""Minority Report"" not only has an outstanding performance from Tom Cruise, but an impressive supporting cast including Max Von Sydow (""Judge Dredd""), Colin Farrell (""Hart's War"", ""American Outlaws""), Samantha Morton (""Sweet and Lowdown""), Kathryn Morris (""The Contender""), Neal McDonough (""Star Trek: First Contact""), Tim Blake Nelson (""O Brother, Where Art Thou""), Jessica Capshaw (""Valentine""), Patrick Kilpatrick (""Free Willy 3""), and Peter Stormare (""Armageddon""). ""Minority Report"" is, without a doubt, one of the absolute best sci-fi action thrillers ever made since ""Blade Runner"".

38313,"Okay, here's the deal:  I first saw ""Magnolia"" in the theater and hated it.  By the time I left the multiplex, my patience was gone (typical multiplex experience), my butt was numb (ditto), and my head hurt.  It is this last which made me buy the DVD on pure impulse when it first hit the shelves.  It has since become one of my favorite movies and is one which I definitely recommend one see at home as opposed to in the theater.  Why?  One word:  Intermission.  Paul Anderson probably would've won my immediate and undying respect had he given the audience a bit of a breather.  I mean, let's face it, nobody enjoys sitting in a multiplex seat for over three hours.  Older films such as ""Dr. Zhivago"" and ""Once Upon a Time In America,"" to name just two, seemed to understand this.  At home you can (and should) take at least one fifteen minute break.  I recommend this not only for the opportunity it offers to get one's head together but because it will allow you to discuss the film with whoever you happen to be watching it with or at least give some thought to what is being said and what is being done if you happen to be on your own.  Trying to take in all of ""Magnolia"" in one uninterrupted sitting is like trying to take in a five course meal without a break.  Does it look good?  Absolutely!  Taste good?  Absolutely!  Leave you feeling so stuffed you feel like you're about to go into cardiac arrest?  Absolutely!  Hopefully Mr. Anderson will take a lesson next time and go ahead and tack on an extra ten or fifteen minutes to allow his audience a chance at some digestion.",N/A
537507,"It's frustrating to sit and read some these reviews.  I think it's time people like me actually review some of the reviews since some people have no idea how to voice a proper opinion without saying something wrong with a completely brilliant production!  First off, a good reviewer will know how hard it is to get a movie off the ground as well as how much work it really takes to ensure it becomes a hit.  Be reminded that thousands of people worked countless hours to make this thing come to life!  Based on some of the serious grammatical errors I see on some of these reviews, they probably don't work near as hard in their own lives so I guess they digress to harping on other peoples work.  That's the nature of the beast, oh well.What's really engaging about this movie to me is that it was shot so beautifully and so eloquently who gives a hoot where the story is going?  The movie gets the job done!So, they have a love triangle-that's cool, you appeal to the lovesick teenage girls who just can't get enough of Ben Affleck and Josh Harnett, not to mention the guys who love watching Kate Beckensale-WOOF!  Bottom line, see, ""From here to eternity,"" and you'll see that Hollywood has been using similar formulas for years in war movies!So, you have flawed historical accounts in a movie-sorry to say it folks, but EVERY movie has that, it keeps continuity to the STORY, not HISTORY itself.  We already have read the ""history"" of Pearl Harbor a million times, why not take a tangent here and there?So, you have bad acting, almost every film that has been a success did not become a success on Oscar winning actors alone.  No one really knows why some things work and some things don&#65533;t, why speak your mind about something already said?  Get over it!  It doesn't say anything about the DVD product!So, it was PG-13, ah ha!  Look what we have coming down the pike!  Low and behold AN R RATED VERSION COMING TO DVD MAY 16TH!  Personally I liked the PG-13 version myself because I felt comfortable taking my twelve-year-old nephew to see the film.  He loves me talking about my adventures in the Navy and I felt at ease that there wouldn't be a ton of gore to make the attack scenes even more horrifying.  Keep in mind, this is a Disney flick and even though it doesn't have Disney written all over it, they still have a rep to protect.  Again, most reviews are not focusing on the DVD itself!When doing reviews on Amazon, people need to keep in mind that the movie has been reviewed a million times and considering how popular of a movie Pearl Harbor was, most everyone has in one form or another-SEEN THE MOVIE!  Get off the high horse of opinionating the movie!  Reviews have long since past!  Review the product! That's what a consumer will want to read!  For instance;How is the sound of the Pearl Harbor DVD?  Phenomenal if you ask me!  My home theatre system is peaked when I put this DVD in!How is the picture of the DVD?  First rate, not a blemish to report here and actually the colors are far more vibrant on the DVD than they ever were in the theatre.  With the exception of a slight pause around the middle of the film, this DVD picture is flawless.Does the DVD have extras?  You bet!  Lots of them!  The new Vista Series DVD (which by the way has released several great versions of previous movies including ""The Sixth Sense"" and ""Unbreakable."") will include even more extras as well as the R-rated version on two discs.  TOO COOL!These are the things consumers want to know before buying a product.  I could care less about your opinion of a film!  Let the consumer be the judge of a film!

701472,"I should start off by saying that I was greatly disappointed by this sequel. Two words: It [stunk].Now let me retread and explain.While this movie does have some great twists and surprises, the only connection that it has with American Psycho is the opening scene featuring Patrick. Even then, it ruins the magic of the original. Many people theorized that Bateman never committed the murders, and AP was quite open ended in that sense, as one could draw his or her own conclusions. This movie simply chucks that out the window, and simply says ""Patrick killed them."" Little surprise here that Christian Bale chose not to reprise his role.I was extremely disappointed in that sense, as I was expecting more of the head trip of ol' Bateman. That is not to say that it is a bad movie though. As I said, it has great twists, and does not go for the traditional cheap thrills expected in teen slasher flicks. It instead substitutes that for intelligent suspense, and a feeling of an itch the viewer just cant scratch until the end. Though there are plenty of goofs in the movie, it is still worth a shot as long as you ignore the American Psycho in the title. This movie would have done great as a stand-alone movie, but as it bears the AP title, my high expectations were crushed.Don't expect any social satire or yuppie jokes, as this film centers around a bunch of college kids. The main character is Rachael Newman, the successor of Patrick Bateman, who as a child of 12, killed Patrick with little remorse (By the way, neither Bateman's apartment, nor Bateman himself look like the ones present in the original AP). She wants to become teaching assistant to William Shatners character, so that she'll get a job in career and stop psychos. She accomplishes this by killing off her assistants. (Go figure)The tone of the film is quite 'cutesy', an odd accomplishment given the nature of the film. While the movie occasionally relies on slow, stacatto tracking shots, much of the film looks quite professionally done, with the exception of a few fake blood stains, and bad audio synching.Oh and don't expect much on the DVD itself either. The only features are the trailer, and scene selection. The trailer is quite cool, with the original AP music playing in the background.All things considered. American Psycho fans, I can't stop you from buying it... heck, I bought it. But take my advice... it [stinks]. Don't expect a movie anything like AP. Why, even Beneath the Planet of the Apes was a better sequel compared to this, and believe me, that sequel [stinks]!",N/A
545212,"This disc is not the best in the world, but it was interesting. Obviously transferred from a video source, the disc is extras-free and not brimming over with quality processing. The overall appearance is rather muddy, and the subtitles are both duplicated in English and Chinese, and very hard to read most of the time. No chapter access, either.On the other hand, the DVD is Widescreen, so I give credit for that. Also, this is a very different style of kung-fu film. I refer to it as a parody because that's what it reminded me of more than anything else; a parody of fantasy martial arts films. Characters not only fly and leap like superheroes, they can also blast opponents with energy bolts, lightning, magical swords, and fantasy kung-fu strikes.The story is a bit hard to follow. Basically, bad guys looking for a magic sword cause the death of Jet Li's parents, and attack their child with with a slow-killing strike. The result is that Jet Li cannot learn kung-fu -- if he tries, he'll die! Eventually, he is cured and becomes the Master of all kung-fu by learning the secret of the &quot;Solar Stance&quot; technique from a powerful kung-fu teacher. Then, Jet can take revenge on the people who killed his parents.Along the way, he meets up with a kung-fu mistress who helps him learn even better kung-fu, another evil kung-fu mistress who wants the handsome young Jet Li for herself, an a bad kung-fu mistress who now controls the magic sword. He also runs into a confusing array of kung-fu masters, enemies, and armies. I admit that I got a bit lost trying to follow who was fighting who, and why. The ending was also left kind of up in the air, as if the film was meant to be the first chapter in a series.Still, the fights are spectacular. Not quite up to the &quot;Once Upon a Time in China&quot; standards, but spectacular nevertheless. In one scene, Jet is attacked with harp strings by the evil mistress, and in another, an army is devestated by an underground assault!Overall, the film is a lot of fun, mostly because it takes itself seriously (albeit with tongue firmly planted in cheek). Despite the shoddy processing, the disc is definitely worth the low price for Jet Li fans, or for &quot;Crouching Tiger&quot; fans with a sense of humor.",N/A
517148,"I read the other reviews proir to renting this concert. I am sad to say that I was dissapointed. I do not doubt that Shania is a very talented performer. In my opinion, this was not one of Shania's best efforts. Furthermore, the sound was not mixed well for this concert. I have rented (and own) several concerts, and this one has below average sound quality. This show comes off as not being &quot;the big time&quot;. We all are aware that by this time in Shania's career (1999) that she had already hit &quot;the big time&quot;. Shania does not do much to make this show very entertaining. The weave she is donning with her hair completely takes away from her looks that everyone knows her for. I do not think that there was any costume changes throughout the entire show. This is NOT a terrible concert, although, if you are expecting something impressive from this concert just because Shania is a superstar and her music is very entertaining, you might feel that this concert is a bit of a letdown.",N/A
599486,"&quot;24&quot; is _not_ &quot;like a soap opera&quot; except in the superficial sense of a story that more-or-less continues from week to week.The closest analog I can think of is a saga like that of the Monkey King being translated to a series format for Asian television. But I don't think there has been any series ever before envisioned and executed with the tight structure and story line of &quot;24.&quot;I made the mistake of renting episodes of the first season (now available at my Blockbuster on DVD). I had seen maybe two and a half of the episodes in the first season when they aired, then gave it up because I didn't want to watch it through to the end without having seen the lead-up. Watching it all at once is like reading a novel that you can't put down. And I realized that that's what this is: a novel, in cinematic form.The show is most obviously unique in the minute-by-minute gimmick. But the gimmick is itself deceptive -- going minute by minute suggests a naturalistic, &quot;slice of life&quot; approach, but in fact the direction and script are tightly stylized. (And because the show keeps cutting between different developments, it's not _really_ minute by minute.) The show is realistic and persuasive, but very highly selective in what it shows and how it shows it, always achieving the maximum effect by minimum means.This is a complete visual novel -- not a condensed translation of a novel, like a mini-series adaptation. It is a complete novel with individual chapters. No other series has ever done this. Many have elements of continuity, etc., with characters developing over time and various sub-plots developing. But except for two-parters, the individual episodes are almost always self-contained. Not here. That's because the goal is to present a visual novel, not just to cover a 24 hour period with minute-by-minute suspense. &quot;24&quot; is also the opposite of soap operas, whose stories never reach any closure.I also appreciate &quot;24&quot; for never thunking you over the head with the effects it is generating. It avoids cliche altogether and always assumes that the viewer will &quot;get it.&quot;  I think in the first season there was only one misstep, and that was the casting of Dennis Hopper as a bad guy with an accent.Somebody is going to figure out that the same cinematic-novel approach will work with other kinds of stories, not just something with a time deadline, and then we'll see more of them. Right now I don't think people realize something new has been invented here. A cinematic novel done from scratch. Done perfectly the first time out of the gate.",24: Season 1

717553,"Having loved the acclaimed PBS production, I was intrigued to see a new adaptation - but, sadly, this one elicits big yawns, not dreams.  First, this is a radically different telling of the story - so which is the faithful adaptation?  I understand that would be the 1980 version.  Secondly, not expecting this to mimic the original, I still expect it to sustain my interest and tell a satisfying, coherent story - yet James Caan and Lisa Bonet genuinely appear to sleepwalk through their performances.  (Doubt that was intended as an homage to the ""dream"" theme.)  Third, David Straithairn is always capable, but expanding his role does little to help the story.  Fourth, Angelo Baladamenti is a gifted composer but I felt his musical score actually bickered with the story mood in some scenes.  Fifth, unlike the 1980 PBS adaptation - which compels the viewer's attention, is tightly constructed, and progressively and logically draws to an inevitable and novel resolution - this new story line seems to meander.  Sixth, in the closing scene, Lisa Bonet's and Lukas Haas' eloqution was so languid and sloppy, I actually had to turn on subtitles to understand their spoken dialogue.  Thus, I actively denounce this ""Lathe"" as anything but ""heavenly.""

She finds herself redefining who she after a two significant losses in her life.When life deals her a very heavy blow she turns to a man who was kind to her and an intense relationship begins.  While the editorial review speaks of the loss of children - it is how those deaths happen that bring about the bond.

Heath Ledger (one of my favorites) turns in a great performance (while I loved him in A Knights Tale, I didn't think he had it in him and now I am hooked!...) as Hank's son and the dynamic intensity between them leaves you bewildered and angry too.This is a movie well worth watching.  If you are Billy Bob Thorton fan - you will not be disappointed.  If you are a Halle Berry fan -  you will be stunned to see the depth with which she potray's such loss and pain.

588172,"Shallow Hal attempts to be both funny and have a significant message.  While the movie is funny and entertaining, I question just how pure its message is.  Much of the humor seems to be at the expense of the various dates Hal has.  Rosemary constantly breaks furniture, weighs down cars and canoes to an extreme, and sends a kid flying out of a swimming pool--her weight is exaggerated to extreme proportions, and tends to reinforce some of the stereotypes overweight people face.  Throughout much of the movie, she is only desirable because Hal sees her as skinny.  Others are portrayed as physically ugly to an extreme, and one transgendered restaurant worker is made fun of because she is so unpassable as a woman.  The movie tries to justify itself by making Hal realize his faults and fall for Rosemary despite her weight, but I find the whole thing ungenuine and the characters cartoonish.  Plus, as a returned Peace Corps volunteer, it was so obvious to me that whoever wrote this movie didn't do any research on how the Peace Corps really operates.

This is truely a terrible film.  I guess you can't really call it ""historical"" since Bay addded plenty of ""Hollywood"" effects to the shocking surprise bombing of Pearl Harbor.  Let's face it, this movie was not intended to be a ""war"" movie, the intention was to be a love drama.  But it failed terribly at achieving even that.

Here we have Jim (Jason Biggs) again struggling to get the girls and along with friends Chris Klein, Sean William Scott and Alyson Hannigan prepares himself for another meeting with European beauty Nadia.  So off they go to a beach house for some fun.What's good about this movie is that the whole cast of the first movie are all here and the cast is actually very good, especially considering it's a teen movie.  Biggs is great as the goofy Jim, Eugene Levy is one of the highlights of the movie as Jim's understanding father and Alyson Hannigan has a bigger role that she plays to great effect.  This all helps to make the audience care for the flawed characters on the screen, and isn't it nice to see flawed characters for a change?Unfortunately though, the humour is purely of the gross-out kind, making you cry out in disgust or nervously laugh at the various embarrassing situations.

255193,"There have been several movies about violence on a New York City subway.  DEATH WISH and THE TAKING OF PELHAM ONE TWO THREE come to mind, but the first exaggerates violence into a dance of death while the second mixes humor with greed to show humanity at its best and worst.  In THE INCIDENT, the security of a 'normal' life is blown away, perhaps forever, for the luckless riders of a New York City subway train that is taken over by two hoodlums, played by a very young Martin Sheen, who uses his boyish good looks first to disarm, then to threaten, and Tony Musante, whose ethnic face and greaser looks would qualify him as an extra in a Bronson movie.  Director Larry Peerce shot the film in a grainy black and white series of hues that catches perfectly the bouncing, jangling horrors of nerves coming unglued.  A subway car is full of passengers whose thoughts are focused on the normalcy of their lives, but violence off the screen is often only a hairsbreath away.  In walk Sheen and Musante, who casually glance at this car and size up its passengers as passive targets for a hatred of the status quo that they themselves can only tear down, but never build up.  Two passengers are soldiers on leave.  The rest are old, weak, or distinctly unthreatening.  The hoods' motivation is not money or even killing.  Rather, they seek only to dominate, to rip aside the facade of what they deem as smug middle-class ignorance and to expose the fear which they are sure is simply there, waiting for gangbangers like them to expose.  In the beginning of this nightmare ride, they are right, of course.  Musante and Sheen bully, browbeat, and humiliate first one, then another, than all collectively.  The victims seem unable to do more than protest feebly.  Beau Bridges, who plays Felix, one of the soldiers, tries to rally the others to his side, while Musante and Sheen snicker at such useless activity and can so dominate with their viciousness that no weapon other than one knife is needed.  Felix, like Marshall Will Kane in HIGH NOON, learns that the quality of human courage that he assumes exists in most people, in fact does not, and it is only rarely to be found even in those whose job it is to evidence it.  Felix is no Will Kane, however, and he must learn the brutal but necessary fact that that the coin of most bullies is psychological.  Some victims are like most of this subway's passengers who refuse to fight back.  Others like Felix do fight back right then and there.  Still others, like Bernie Goetz, are those who fight back too, but in a time and place of their own choosing, and their response, like Goetz's, is often to show a side of the victim that is just as bleak and horrific as anything that Musante and Sheen show while browbeating others.

Guy Pierce was convincing as the ""guy with the memory thing"" and Carrie Ann Moss was sweet with a hint of something you can't quite put your finger on.  Joe Pantoliano was great as the ""good cop - bad cop"" dual personality.  This movie kept me guessing right up to an ending that could have easily come from a John Carpenter flick.  A little twisted but nothing that should offend anyone. There are lots worse on commercial TV.  I intend to watch it again with friends who couldn't make the first screening.",Memento VHS

And i will admit first off that it does start out a little on the slow side, but once it picks up it is one of the most intense and well-acted movies of the year.  It shows the two-sided nature of people in such perfection that you see a lot of yourself.  There are scenes where you're yelling at the screen because the actors make you become so involved in their life that you feel present at the party.  I honestly don't know how someone could not enjoy this movie.  The only way i could imagine that is that they don't get past the slow beginning.  This beautiful story of human nature and relationships gone awry is well worth the wait...",N/A
209355,"How many of us will actually admit that we enjoyed this movie? Hence, that is why it is a guilty pleasure of mine.Of course, 20 years ago, when I first saw it, I wouldn't have agreed with my previous statement here.For a sequel, it isn't bad, but it isn't good either. It's so bad it is good.  This is classic 80's cheese at it's finest 1 and 1/2 hours.What is really amazing about this film is that Michelle Pfeiffer is the star.  She plays Stephanie Zinoni, the new leader of the Pink Ladies.  Yes, the pink ladies are in this one, too. Not only can Pfeiffer look down right unhappy to be in this film, but she can sing! and dance!  sort of...The highlight for her singing is with &quot;Cool Rider&quot;, a tune in which she declares what it is she really wants in a guy to Michael.She isn't a bad crooner, she even crooned in a much better movie &quot;The Fabulous Baker Boys&quot;.  Watching this on t.v.(the watered down, edited version), the other day, and now being older and wiser than I was the first 20 times, I think that Pfeiffer really didn't want to do this film.  Perhaps she was embarrassed and still is by it. She doesn't look like she is enjoying being in a musical comedy.  Her acting isn't bad, but it is strained.  Maybe that is how the character should be played, but like John Travolta in &quot;Grease&quot;, she just looks bored and uninterested.As far as the movie goes, I can't believe I was so obsessed with this at one time.  I know it was only because it had the name &quot;Grease&quot; attached to it.That is the only similarity it has with the original.  That and some of the same actors have come back.  Didi Conn, Sid Ceasar, Eve Arden, and Doodie Goodman are all here.  Frenchie, is showing Sandy's English cousin, Michael Carrington, played quite lamely by Maxwell Caulfield, the &quot;ropes&quot;.  Michael falls for Stephanie. Stephanie has just dumped the leader of the t-birds, Johnny Nogerelli.  Johnny is played by Adrian Zmed. He hasn't become an Academy award nominated actor like Pfeiffer, but he is a decent enough actor who seems to fit more into this and looks more comfortable than Michelle.Michael does everything he can in his power to become the &quot;cool rider&quot; that Stephanie is looking for.  The really unrealistic part is how she meets up with him once he becomes Mr. Cool Rider, and she doesn't even know who he really is. But we wouldn't have much of a movie if she did know, right?Also, the ending of the first movie is so much better.  Here, we have a luai with corny tunes. Much much cornier than &quot;We got Together&quot;.  Instead, we get &quot;We'll be together&quot; as the last song.Even though I know this is hardly a great movie musical, it seems to still keep me entertained today.  The soundtrack has some really fun songs, and once again, I find myself just having fun watching and singing along.Watch it for pure mindless fun.",N/A
421923,"How I do miss the boys.  At a time when MTV was actually cool and was playing music videos, (what are those again?), Beavis and Butt-head pretty much ruled the channel, providing us with hours after hours of pure entertainment.  Was it stupid entertainment?  Of course it was, that's why it was so amusing.  I actually think of the shows as a clever satire of how high school students are portrayed.  Now with their very own film, ""Beavis and Butt-Head Do America,"" the boys are causing more chaos and mischief than ever before.After their beloved television set is stolen, Beavis and Butt-Head decide to watch another one, no matter where they find it.  Their stupidity leads them a drunken fool who mistakes the boys for paid killers he had hired to kill his wife.  And things quickly go out of control from one mix up to another.  The boys end up being a ""national security threat"" with every FBI agent after them.  And all they wanted was their TV back!  The results are hilarious and unpredictable.This is a great movie for anyone who loves Beavis and Butt-Head.  Is it as good as the shows?  Not in my opinion, but it's pretty darn close.  The sick and stupid humor is all there and the storyline is very creative and well-done.  There are tons of celebrity voices that you just might recognize.The DVD itself is average.  Nothing real new and exciting here.  There's two trailers, and that's about it.  The sound and picture quality is really good.  I just wished the DVD itself had more to offer.  This is a movie I wouldn't mind re-buying if they ever decide to make a special edition.All in all, ""Beavis and Butt-Head Do America"" is outrageously funny and is a lot more clever than people give it credit for.  If you want laughs and a good time, pick up this film as soon as possible.  Just thank God that you're not as dumb as these two morons.  Thanks to these two dudes, you'll never want to drop out of high school.",Beavis & Butthead Do America VHS
539748,"There was a point about half way through ""The Bourne Identity"" when I realized that the movie had no real plot --- but I was enjoying it anyway. Sometimes all you need is a good, solid lead, some nice action, and a well-kept pace in order to be entertained. Thankfully, the movie provides all of those attributes.""The Bourne Identity"" is about Jason Bourne (Matt Damon), who is found floating in offshore waters by some fisherman, taken aboard their boat, and then recovers from two weeks at sea and two gunshot wounds. The recovery is quick, and Bourne is soon back on land, attempting to find out who he is, all the while people are trying to kill him. And he manages to hitch himself with a European drifter girl named Marie (played by Franka Potente, of ""Run Lola Run"" fame).Unfortunately for us, and the reason why I say that the movie has no real ""plot"", is that any possibility of mystery and intrigue is zapped out of the story by a few factors. 1: From the title alone, and then a passport seen relatively early on, *we* know Bourne's identity well before he does. 2: We also are clued-in to who is trying to kill him, long before he starts to get an idea, as the action cuts back and forth to his adversaries quite often. And 3: as we know who he is, what his job used to be, who his adversaries are, and what *they* are doing to try to catch him, the potential plot of ""mystery"" is completely removed. All we are left with is the possibility of suspense during some of the action scenes.Ah, but do those fulfill the purpose admirably. Even though we either already know what's going, or can pretty easily guess, once the story leads us into one of its many action scenes, all bets are off. The suspense comes into focus. The tension arises. And the fighting (Matt Damon must have taken some professional lessons) is great to watch, if a tad bloody. There is one scene in particular in which Bourne outwits an assassin, and it simply teems with nervous excitement as to how he'll resolve the conflict.""The Bourne Identity"" may suffer from an overexposure of its more mysterious elements, but it stands up well under the wonderful talents of Matt Damon and Franka Potente. They have good chemistry, and the director is smart to keep a primary focus on them. The story moves along at a strong pace, and feels sure of itself. All in all, not bad, as techno spy thrillers go.",N/A
405331,"This *widescreen* version is a scrumptious edition which corrects some editing flaws apparent in the cropped/fullscreen DVD one. Violet Beauregarde at one point does indeed have her finger up her nose during the boat journey down the chocolate river tunnel.Despite the dated styles in acting, clothes, and music, this musical's appeal has stood up very well (but, hey, look at the 1939 Wizard of Oz for *dated*!).After a recent reading of Charlie and The Chocolate Factory, David Seltzer's rework of Dahl's source comes across as not so much an adaptation as an alternate version of the same story. It's tighter and has better dramatic flow than the book.The musical numbers by Bricusse, Newly and Scharf are engaging, not too frequent or cloying, and don't stall the plot. Not Arlen and Harberg, perhaps, but somewhat of a cut above the predominantly wretched pop music of the early 1970s.In an unacknowledged but probably necessary dramatic hiccup, Grandpa Joe sings the important song ""I've got a Golden Ticket"", which by rights should be rendered by Charlie. But as Peter Ostrum admittedly could not hold a tune (a serious casting flaw), Jack Albertson rises to the occasion and rasps it out just fine.I thinks it's very funny that ""Wonka"" was originally pitched to Quaker Oats by the movie's producers as a candy-bar-promotion gimmick to be shot on a shoestring budget. The irony is that the movie is so good but that the currently Nestle-produced Wonka-brand candy is so bad. But the movie rises above its base commercial roots and stands nicely on its own.Buy it & see it, while you wait for the remake...HOWEVER....It is most unfortunate that the only girl role models are such horrid brats!With the book, my 4 year old daughter kept asking about and referring back to Veruca Salt and Violet Beauregarde. But can one say anything positive about those ill-fated characters? At this critical time in her development, when she's looking to women and girls (real and in literature) as role models, the only girls in sight are punished and humiliated for their aggressiveness.I don't begrudge Charlie and his spiritual journey with Grandpa Joe, or his final reward. But there's little in the book or movie of redeeming value for young girls.The underlying message of the movie and the book is that girls have no part in larger adventures and rewards, that men and boys and male Oompa Loompas run the show. Mothers are either shrill, hysterical harpies or passive, feckless shadows.",Willy Wonka & the Chocolate Factory VHS

475441,"&quot;Walking With Dinosaurs&quot; is really a spectacular job of television production. The series' creators have crafted a nature series in which one follows dinosaurs in much the same way &quot;Wild Kingdom&quot; followed living animals, only without the hokey Mutual of Omaha commercials. Of course the science is often quite speculative and 10 years from now much of it may be revised, but this is the state of the art of paleontology as we know it today.The only thing that keeps this DVD from getting five stars from me is one annoying feature: periodically a distracting icon pops up in the upper right of the screen alerting you to the fact that you can activate a window to see some producer's commentary or a behind-the-scenes look at how a particular scene was filmed. These little extras are rarely all that compelling when the feature is activated but even if you say you want the window turned off, the icon continues popping on, usually obstructing some dinosaur's face for a few seconds just enough to annoy the viewer.The publishers should have taken better note of the &quot;popularity&quot; of Microsoft's talking paperclip.

Pay attention to the ratings people, it's PG-13 for a reason.  If your kid isnt scared easily great, but if they are, dont take them.. the orcs and goblins and ringwraiths and such were just too much for some of the kids that were there.But back to why the movie's great.

Denzel Washington gives a superb performance as Alonzo Harris, an LAPD officer from the Narcotics unit who really has an attitude towards everyone who cross in his path. Ethan Hawke is Jake, the rookie police officer who accompanies Alonzo during this ""training day"". But Alonzo is not really interested in training this rookie, he's more worried about acheiving something Jake is not aware of. And Jake also doesn't know this Alonzo attitude may put his life in danger.Antoine Fuqua, the director of Bait, returns with a marvelous piece of a movie, in which he shows again that he really has the touch for this filmmaking stuff. We all know Denzel won the Academy Award for Best Actor in a Leading Role and even though I didn't even expect a nomination for him when I first saw the film, the truth is he really deserved this award.During the movie, we get to see the transformation of an everyday man, in this case, a police officer, to a desperate man ready to do anything to save his own (rear). In a style that somewhat resembles the 1993 film Falling Down, we accompany this guy on the downward spiral to a definitive conclusion and he doesn't care about bringing his parnter down with him. As the day is dying and the sun approaches the horizon, time is running out for Alonzo Harris and soon, Jake realizes he's the only one who can stop the selfish actions of his superior.But enough about all this, what are you waiting for?

723807,"Without question, Paul McCartney's 2002 tour may have been his best post-Beatles performances. His voice was far stronger than his 1990 and 1993 tours, and his young band really made McCartney work harder than he'd done in decades. While not as many surprises in the set list as before, those selected made for a well-paced exciting show.But, this DVD isn't quite as good of a souvenir as those of us who attended the shows would've liked. First off, it might be THE most fawning video of a performer. An artist of his stature hardly needs the gushing validation that this offers, plus all the superstar accolades. And all this fawning takes up time away from the music. Only about 29 of the 35 songs played on the tour are performed in the concert film (another three are in the bonus section), and not all the songs are performed complete. Sadly, his sweet tribute to George Harrison, ""Something"" is trimmed by a whole verse. Surely we could have cut out one more shot of a middle aged soccer mom screaming ""PAUL!""......... to find room for this lovely song complete. Finally, the songs aren't in the order they were played, which is likewise disappointing as it was the pace of the show that was part of its success.As for the disc quality, the authoring of this is really sad, almost like it was done on a home computer. The same footage appeared in the ABC-TV special in far better quality, so this is just a mediocre DVD master. The disc's authors have also put the scene/track selections in the ""Special Features"" section (not exactly where I'd look for them), but you can quick access your favorite song.But on the plus side - it sounds fantastic. The performances chosen from the tour footage are outstanding, both McCartney and band are in terrific form. The bonus materials (soundchecks, backstage, etc.) are generous and will make McCartney fans happy.So...a mixed review.

Not that this is bad, really...Just that its not as good as it should be. The British cast (Julie Andrews, Colin Firth, Stephen Fry and Sophie Thompson) play their roles flawlessly, the Americans (William Baldwin, Jeanne Tripplehorn) less so.The plot: a member of the British nobility (Andrews) is dismayed when her son (NOT Colin Firth as some OTHER reviewers would have you believe)becomes engaged to a movie star (Tripplehorn) whose ex(Baldwin) follows her to England to reunite.Stephan Fry as the butler, and Sophie Thompson as ""milady's"" companion/secretary are wonderful; as are the various actors and actresses who make up the staff of the manor. Likewise, Colin Firth gives a hilarious performance of her gay nephew, who aids and abets in the eventual reunion. The upstairs-downstairs feel of the film adds to the confusion; a welcome distraction from the Balwin/Tripplehorn storyline.

Seen through his central nervous system and eyes, we experience  his world of fragments, like collage pieces of existence.  The only place he could make those fragments whole was in a painting. Otherwise, he was wholly inable to put a fully realized human being, himself, together.

Nicole and Ewan have incredible acting and singing talents, which make the film enjoyable, but what is even better is that they have terrific chemistry.

Casting is superb and one can only hope that future sequels will use the same Parker, Harry Osborn and Jamison.The story line is clear and easy to understand. You needn't be familiar with the comic book. Charactors develop naturally and can be sympathized with (or hated).Special effects are outstanding.

274752,"I know everyone has said this, but I still feel the need to include it anyway. THIS IS NO 2001. Duh! It doesn't even come close to Stanley Kubrick's enigmatic epic of space exploration and the possibility of other worldly intelligence. This one, set nine years after the events in 2001(Duh!) features a group of American and Russian astronauts who travel to Jupiter to investigate what happened on the spaceship Discovery. From this point they go against everything Kubrick wanted to do, in other words, they explained EVERYTHING. And I mean everything; the purpose of the Monoliths(aka the giant Hershey Bar looking things), why HAL went wacko, and even the fate of Dave Bowman. While Kubrick's film was a feast of visuals and of the mystery of Space, this film, directed by Peter Hyams(who went on to make such duds as &quot;End Of Days&quot; and &quot;The Musketeer&quot;) is basically just another mid-80's commentary on the potential destructive force of the Cold War(which today dates the film immediately). That's not to say that this was a bad film. Some of the explanations of the events in the first film were kind of interesting. However, it was what Kubrick didn't say, what he didn't spell out, that made us wonder, that made us remember, and what made his film the sweeping masterpiece that it is today. And that, unfortunately, is something that 2010 will never be, a masterpiece. Even the few scenes featuring astronaut Dave Bowman only serve as a painful reminder of a much better film.Thank you for Reading.",2010: The Year We Make Contact VHS

A true story of a masked killer who terrorized Texarkana, Arkansas during part of 1946. The killer murdered five people, brutalized three more, and was never found.

602317,"Anthony Hopkins, smooth and suave as always, had too much face time in ""Red Dragon."" Hannibal Lechter is a hard act to follow in the monstrous killer department, and he has Francis Dolarhyde (Ralph Fiennes) at a disadvantage. That being said, ""Red Dragon"" is beautifully directed by Brett Ratner, and the cinematography is brilliant.Will Graham (Ed Norton) almost died in the capture of Lechter and is now semi-retired, burnt out and trying to embrace serenity at gorgeous digs on the coast of Florida with his wife and son.  His boss, Jack Crawford (Harvey Keitel) calls the reluctant Graham back to active duty on a grisly serial killer case.  The press has labeled the killer ""The Tooth Fairy"" because of his modus operandi in murdering entire families in their homes.  Will, like Clarise in ""Silence of the Lambs,"" has an eerie ability of transference into the thoughts and minds of deranged killers.The picture beautifully foreshadows Dolarhyde's insanity with glimpses of his journal, voice-overs of the horrendous grandmother that raised and twisted him, and quick cuts of the spooky Home for Convalescents where he grew up.  Harvey Keitel plays Crawford brusque and brutal which gives the film some much-needed grittiness.  Ralph Fiennes and Ed Norton are both movie star handsome, which is not necessarily a plus in this type of film.  In spite of Fiennes' subtle acting and his tortured psyche, I was just too sympathetic with him to get properly scared.  Norton just did not seem like he was a battle scarred veteran or particularly traumatized; he looked like an ideal leading man, which he is.Big kudos on the cinematography and visuals:  a quick cut that shows the viewer the only horrifying way that Dolarhyde can reach a sexual climax took less than a minute and would have taken hours to explain---Dolarhyde's magnificently tattooed back making him appear a sinuous monster of prey.Special congratulations to Philip Seymour Hoffman who makes the screen sizzle with his portrayal of the smarmy tabloid reporter, Freddy Lounds.  He plays off Dolarhyde's revulsion and fury with frightening realism.  Emily Watson as Dolarhyde's blind, unwitting love interest is spot on in her portrayal of a blind person, but a little too worldly wise to be believable as a nave victim.""The Red Dragon"" is a well-made, beautifully produced film.  The pace is good and doesn't have a boring moment.  Don't wait for the DVD.",N/A

Which is a shame since it's a remarkably well-made, smooth romantic comedy.  Julia Ormond is exceedingly charming, and if her leading man doesn't quite deliver his usual suave charm, the excellent cinematography and classy musical score make up for some of the disappointment.The story of Sabrina never fails to charm, though, regardless of the players.  Her awkward dreamer character grows up, and then beguiles and humanizes the awkward, crusty businessman.  Pick up the classic version for a night when a master's work can be appreciated.

523054,"There are good movies and there are great movies.  A great movie has the ability to transport the audience from mere spectator to participant.  Ridley Scott's GLADIATOR thrusts the viewer into ancient Roman history through the character of General Maximus Meridius.  He is a storied hero, a man with integrity and values, honorable to his lord, Emperor Marcus Aurelius.  Although the film is not completely accurate in its historicity, Scott gives enough fact to send the audience back in time to ancient Rome, during the reign of the Caesars.The film begins on the battlefield with Rome engaging in one last conflict.  A victory will further expand the Empire and secure its quest for world domination, a worthy achievement for a Roman emperor.  Led by Maximus, the powerful Roman army overcomes the opposition in a bloody war scene, which is not for the meek and timid.  Victorious celebration follows, but Marcus Aurelius, aging and dying, is not completely satisfied.  He summons Maximus to his quarters and shares his feelings and wishes with him, as a father would a son.Marcus Aurelius: There was a dream that was Rome. You could only whisper it.  Anything more than a whisper and it would vanish, it was so fragile.Marcus Aurelius: You have proven your valor once again, Maximus. Let us hope for the last time.Maximus Decimus Meridius: There is no one left to fight, sire.Marcus Aurelius: There is always someone left to fight. How can I reward Rome's greatest general?Maximus Decimus Meridius: Let me go home.Marcus Aurelius: Ah, home.These words set the tone for the remainder of the movie for indeed this would not be Maximus' last fight.  Marcus Aurelius' son, Commodus, would soon take over the reign of the great empire and almost instantaneously, the dream that was Rome would disappear.  As for Maximus, he would suffer through many a hardship, and find himself fighting for Rome, not as a general, but as a gladiator.GLADIATOR is a great movie, and one of epic proportions.  It is so good that it can be watched repeatedly, with the audience standing in awe, learning something new with each showing.  This is a film with plenty of action thus satisfying those with a lust for bloody fight scenes.  Men especially will enjoy watching Maximus in his gladiator battles, but women will be enamored with his softer side.  He is a loyal family man, honorable, and a man of integrity.  It is also an educational movie for history lovers or anyone interested in ancient Roman history.  Scott paints a vivid  picture for audiences as he is acute to historical detail, such as the scenes from the Roman Colisseum, which give the audience a real sense of being there.  Moreover, Scott touches on some philosophical and sociological issues that will appease the intellectual mind as well.GLADIATOR is a great movie, because it has a fine cast of actors, beginning with Russell Crowe (Maximus) in the lead role.  Crowe is perfect for the part, having lost around 40 lbs. to play the muscular general, his New Zealand accent adding a touch of a classic quality to the role.  His performance was outstanding and the success of the film depended on it.Playing the part of the antagonist was Joaquin Phoenix (Commodus) who was equally sensational.  He was definitely in character as the evil ruler, but also excelled in his alter-ego, a very frightened little boy who could not live up to his father's wishes.  Moreover, the supporting cast was wonderful from top to bottom, but add two seasoned veterans like Richard Harris (Marcus Aurelius) and Oliver Reed (Proximo) to this list and you get a great movie.  On a sad note, Reed passed away soon after shooting the movie, but the film was dedicated to him in the credits.  His role as Proximo, the trainer of gladiators, was excellent as his character was both tough and funny.In conclusion, many different qualities must come together to distinguish a good movie from a great one, and Ridley Scott has hit on all eight cylinders.  GLADIATOR belongs in every family's movie archive, yes, it is that GREAT.",Gladiator VHS

This is a fine, intelligent film with a lean screenplay by Huston and Ray Bradbury. While I would have loved to have seen Laurence Olivier play Ahab, I think Gregory Peck turns in an adequate performance. Much of the action is shot at various outdoor locations and the special effects were impressive for the time. The great Orson Welles appears in the small but important role of Father Marple. The themes of friendship, revenge, and the role of conscience are all examined in ""Moby Dick"". Great literature often tanks when translated to the big screen. While ""Moby Dick"" is not among the greatest films of all time, it is a solid, admirable adaptation of Melville's masterpiece. I highly recommend it.",Moby Dick VHS
675242,"...Without question, at the heart of the film is a monumental yet simple story of true love in the purest sense, and of the devotion which renders that love eternal.  But the film transcends even that, and within the greater context indicates the impact of the past upon the present, which is summed up in a single line from the film:  ""Know the past, know the present.""  And know, too, that the love portrayed in this story is the kind of love that is abiding, and that which sustains all that makes life worth living.  It's a veritable journey of the soul; one that will touch you deeply and linger in your memory long after the screen has gone dark.Upon receiving the news that his father has died, Luo Yusheng (Honglei Sun) leaves the city to return to his home, a small village in the mountains, to bury his father and comfort his bereaved mother, Zhao Di (Yulian Zhao).  When he arrives, however, he discovers that his mother will not be consoled until her wish concerning the burial of her husband, Luo Changyu (Hao Zheng) is fulfilled.  In keeping with a long standing tradition and superstition, Di insists that his coffin be carried by hand by the men of the village along the road connecting the village and the city, insuring by so doing that in death Changyu will always be able to remember his way home.Yusheng quickly finds that realizing his mother's request will be no easy task; their village is small and all of the able-bodied men have left for the city, leaving only children and those too old for such an arduous undertaking.  And it is winter, a harsh time of year in the mountains.  But Di is adamant, and so Yusheng sets about the business of fulfilling her request.  And as he does so, he reflects upon the story of his parents; a story well known throughout the village, for theirs was a love that was unbridled and boundless, the likes of which no one in the village had ever know before.  Or since.This film, so wonderfully crafted and delivered by director Zhang, is altogether ethereal and transporting; he tells the story in simplistic terms, and yet it is in that very simplicity that he finds the genuine honesty and truth that provides such an emotional impact and makes this love story one that rivals any the screen has ever known.  Aided by the masterful cinematography of Yong Hou, Zhang achieves that same sense of transcendence that defines much of Akira Kurosawa's films, such as ""Ran"" and ""Akira Kurosawa's Dreams,"" or Ang Lee's ""Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon.""  There is not a superfluous moment in the entire film, and Zhang proves that capturing pure emotion with the camera can express more than pages of dialogue recited by an actor.  And with his lens, Zhang opens up the very heart of the film and lays it bare for all to see and feel, finding more in the eyes of his characters and in their expressions than words could ever convey.  It's a study of human nature that is disarming in it's candor, and quite simply a brilliant piece of filmmaking by a director with an irrefutably incisive understanding of the human condition.Without question, though, the single aspect that makes this such an unforgettable film is the performance (in her motion picture debut) by Ziyi Zhang as the young Zhao Di.  A young woman of exquisite beauty, she has a sublime screen presence that is a portrait of the angelic, and her innate ability to silently express the myriad emotions called for by her character is used to great effect by director Zhang.  Ziyi's portrayal is one of youthful innocence mixed with stubborn determination, which gives her character the necessary depth to be entirely convincing, and she will win you over in a heartbeat.  She is so affecting that near the end, when Di, now an old woman, is hurrying across a rickety foot bridge, the same bridge we've seen the young Di traverse many times on her way to and from the schoolhouse (which is central to the story), despite the weathered age so evident on her face, because of the lasting impression made by Ziyi, you realize that she still bears the heart of the young woman you've come to care so much about by this time, and you understand that age is superficial; that this is a shell housing the spirit and the true beauty that resides within.  It's a beautiful moment to behold, and ours forever, due to the extraordinary performance and presence of the delicate Ziyi Zhang, as well as the tremendous sensitivity and care with which she is presented by director Zhang.The supporting cast includes Bin Li (Grandmother), Guifa Chang (Old Mayor), Wencheng Sung (Mayor) and Zhongxi Zhang (Crockery Repairman).  A love story told sincerely from the heart is a treasure that endures forever, like a painting by Monet or Renoir; and like those artists, director Zhang is nothing less than an impressionist behind the camera, capturing the distinctive rhythms of life and love for all time in ""The Road Home,"" a gentle, poetic film that will make it's way into the hearts of all who experience it.  And therein remain, forevermore.",The Road Home
322078,"I've watched this film so many times, I know all the lines. This is not just the best telling of Dickens tale, but a classic film for all time, all seasons. Alistair Sim is incomprable as Scrooge. All the actors are wonderful, they so perfectly convey the feeling of 19th century London. Look for Patrick McNee, who later gained fame as ""John Steed"" in the wonderful ""Avengers"", as the young Jacob Marley, and Hermione Baddely, who was an accomplished stage actress and favorite of Tennessee Williams, she also later played ""Mrs. Naugatuct"",the tipsy housekeeper, on t.v.'s ""Maude"", as Mrs. Bob Cratchet. The only reason to see any of the other versions is to reinforce just how superior this one is, though the Reginald Owen and George C. Scott versions are respectable. I found the Patrick Stewart version abominable, as expected. This is too good a film to be watched only once a year, it will transport you so realisticly to Olde London. And the storys lessons of forgiveness and remorse are just as meaningful now as then. Oh, not to ruin the illusion, but in the scene when Scrooge awakens Christmas Day, after having had his ""epiphany"", watch as he's looking in the mirror, as he tells his housekeeper about his ordeal. You will see, reflected in the mirror, the reflection of a modern-day (circa 1950) person, more than likely one of the crew. Don't know if this bit of trivia is common knowledge, but I find it interesting. Also, though Simm is only known by most for his role as Scrooge, check out his very funny ""St. Trinians"" films, where he plays headmaster at a boys school. A wonderful, different look at this great actor. This heartwarming film will be THE Christmas classic for all time.POSTSCRIPT!!!I just noticed I reviewed the ""colorized"" version. DANGER!! DANGER!!

544762,"Yesterday, on April 28, we have finally seen the theatrical release of this masterpiece in Japan, and the waiting time was very, very long.  But it was worth of our patience.  ""The Others"" is not only a chilling and scary movie; it is crafted with style and intelligence, and it is fantastic to watch the director (who is still below the age of 30!!) create this piece of art.As you probably have known by now, beautiful Nicole Kidman  plays Grace, whose children are allergic to light (and this disaease really exists, you should know).  With ritual-like meticulous rules, she manages her household works, employing new servants in a huge, dreary countryhouse, which ever-hanging fogs mystriously surround.  But there is (or are), she comes to know, some intruder(s) here, of which existence her children are convinced.  And sooner or later, Grace comes to feel that, too.It is a natural but unfair comparison if you point out that ""The Others"" resembles at some places a certain Oscar-nominated film, because the director Amenabar does it with completely different touch.  I cannot tell you much, but let me say, like Hitchcock's classic ""Rebecca,"" the heroine (and the audience) is lured inexplicably into the mystery of the old house and its past.  Also using the classic frameworks of ghost stories used in the original ""Haunting"" (Robert Wise version, NOT THAT remake), the film makes us jumping in the seats, sending lots of chill in spine, and, moreover, it treats a universal subject of love between mother and children in a subtle fashion.  On top of that, the film goes further, to make the mother Grace not exactly an ideal one for kids, and it succeeds eventually in depicting the fraility of humans -- in short, you really don't know what you think you know.Anchored by strong and believable acting given from underrated Nicole Kidman (why did Oscar ignore her work here, preferring  that musical ... well, but all right, I understand), and aided effectively by other well-cast players whose uncanny presence unnerve us greatly, ""The Others"" will rivet your eyes on the screen, especially when you are a connoisseur of old-fashioned horror film.  Keep your eyes open when you see the details of the film: furniture, photoes, everything.  Something is wrong with this house, but how and what is not clear.  This bizzare sensation is another asset of the film, and you will find what you missed with repeated viewing.For those who have enjoyed this (and I bet you did), the story is perhaps inspired by Henry James's novella ""Turn of the Screw,"" which deals with the similar situation.  You may as well read that equally well-crafted, creepy story.Trivia: look closely at one of the old photoes of the dead: one of the three men on the bed is director Amenabar himself  (and one of the others is Mateo Gil, director of Spanish film ""Nadie conoce a nadie"" of which music Amenabar composed, and of which star Eduardo Noriega was featured in the two previous Amenabar film in Spain, ""Thesis"" and ""Open Your Eyes.""  The former one is a must-see for anyone loving blood-curdling thriller.  But hey, appearing in a photo?  This is exactly what Hitchcock did in one of his earlier films about a life-boat, another masterpiece about the people in a confined place !!  Surely Amenabar loves his master.",The Others

He's been painting a lot in his studio and he won't let wife Barbara Stanwyck see his portrait of her.  Hmmmmm?  Could this mean ...?  The film starts slowly, and doesn't really hit its stride until Stanwyck starts doing the math and adding up the clues.  Up until that time, not much happens.  Bogart is O.K., but this certainly isn't one of his top performances.  Stanwyck is very good once she's given a chance to act later in the film. Alexis Smith, as the intended next Mrs. Carroll, doesn't much register with a distant performance that reveals nothing of her character (although the script gives her little to do anyways, other than a few good exchanges with Bogart at a tea party).

258316,"This movie is wonderfully funny but didn't do to well in the box office (nor since).  The plot, brefeily, is about a viking who, during an aborted rape makes a real emotional connection with his potential victim begins to question if all the piliaging and looting is really worthwhile ( he alreday thinks rape is kind of crude and would prefer there to be some mutual effection, but doesn't want the other vikings to think he is a geek) and he sets off on a quest to find the gods and end the age of Ragnorok.  Ah, but there is the rub.  The gods live in Valhalla ( their heaven ) and the only way to get there is to die in combat.  Unfortunatly the understanding of many of the jokes in this movie are vastly enhanced by some knowledge of the Norse mythology that forms their basis jokes, and that knowledge is just not wide spread in the U.S.  ( I mean, come on, I live a mile from a Christian school call their sports teams the Vikings, that's like osama calling his gang the crusaders).One of the wonderful things about thigs film are the humerouse intersections of these particular Norse customs/beliefs with very real and timeless human interplay between the charactes that trancends culture, particularly in the way boys behave.  One viking taunts another that his grandfather died of old age ( the only way to get to valhallha being to die in battle ), one tuanting another at his sea-sickness in mock sympathy while actually trying to get him to puke more  (""alot of the best sailors wher pukers... all the way out and all the way back, puke puke puke, used to puck in his sleep""), a father pointing out to his son that ""when I was your age I used to go beserk all the time"" and a delightful scean where Eric ( tim robbins ) explains to his father ( I think Micky Roony) that he has come to question their life style and his father acts like you would expect Jesse Helms to react if he found out a son was gay.  Of the sceans of this type, however, probably none is as good as the opening rape scean, where tim robbins fumbling attempts to initiate a rape make it clear he is inexpericned and lead to being mocked and lectured by the victim all while he responds with the embarassment of a young boy chagrined at being discovered to be less cool than he wants the other vikings to believe.  This develops into an argument in wich he justifies his actions as being things that are just self evidently the sort of things one should do while she attack the logical foundation of his reasoning.  ( while the premise of this scean could be found to be offensive by many it is so over the top funny it is one of my favorite comedy sceans ever )Among other themes this film touches on ( and I don't mean to indicate that this film is deep, it is certainly not, but it does address serious issues in a lighthearted way) are the conflicts between the norse religion and the blooming of christianity, their different world views, racial intolerence ( a fovorite scean being a japanse overseer on a slave ship who whips the men at the oars while mocking everything about them ( in subtitles)  from their lack of subtlety and failure to worship their ancestors, to the fact that cook their fish and have large breasted women,) the futility of missionaries among those who can think, and what would happen to the arms industry if peace broke out.

I watched it through to its conclusion, hoping to reach some semblance of an explanation for everything I'd seen and had been confused by up to that point....but I didn't.  It left me with the impression that the director's main focus was not on developement of the characters or the advancement of the story, but rather it was keeping the audience confused that seemed to be the main goal, and if that is the case, then I will say that he at least succeeds in that respect.  It most certainly worked on me.  To make it worse, most of the actors don't even seem to know what they're doing, and aren't doing a very good job of covering up that fact.  Even Eliza Dushku, my favorite actress, had no chance of saving this picture.

The film starts off with one of the most intense, ugly and fear-provoking character sketches of the genre -- Robert Ryan plays a big city cop whose soul has been killed by his job -- he's seen too many hopheads, gun molls and lowlifes, and they've infected him with their grubbiness, transforming him into ""a gangster with a badge.""  Although his sadistic methods get results, Ryan's partners are afraid to work with him and the chief of police has to repeatedly reprimand him to take it easy with the rough stuff.  When these warnings don't work, he gets reassigned to a murder case in a presumably bucolic podunk town.  Where the plot goes from there is unusual and unexpected; suffice it to say this is no run-of-the-mill cops and robbers movie.  Beautiful cinematography, too, by the way.  Unusual and highly recommended.",N/A

Ron Howard proves that he has grown up, and moved on to bigger things. This was a great film, with a great message about a disorder that is so hard for so many people around the world. Go see it, and be moved.The only problem that I had with this film was that the whole time that Crowe's character was seeing things, NOT ONCE did he see a Smurf. If he had seen atleast a few of them, the impact of the film would have been greater!Aside from that, go see this marvelous film from Dreamworks!",N/A

157642,"One of the two 1972 American International films that Ray Milland appeared in (the other being Lee Frost's `The Thing with Two Heads'), `Frogs' is less immediately appealing than its counterpart - its basic concept certainly isn't as outlandish - but ultimately it is decently satisfying. Milland plays Jason Crockett, a crotchety millionaire who is used to celebrate his birthday every year with his family at his costly island estate; most of the rich family's members are concerned with image a lot more than with anything else (no tentative is made to downplay their obnoxiousness). Senior Crockett's disdain for nature is revealed gradually, via generally understated touches, and as a whole the film is quite enigmatic, since minimal exposition is provided about Crockett's estate and the various characters. Although it could have been better exploited, the wide theme of `man versus nature' is more important in this film than the perfunctory subplots, most of which involve Sam Elliott's character; an uneasy atmosphere pervades the movie, and the dense soundtrack - one of this DVD's main highlights - complements it effectively.",N/A
690815,"PARAGRAPH 175 is a beautifully photographed, historicaly accurate, sensitively enlightening film about the Nazi persecution and slaughter of the Pink Triangle, as male homosexuals were designated in Hitler's concentration camps.  But for once a documenting film does not focus on grotesque pictures of bodies, wretched camp conditions or images of abuse and torture.  The film's makers instead opt for the more sensitive approach of interviewing the few remaining men (and one woman)who survived the period.  From these elderly gentlemen we hear memories of how fun Berlin was from 1914 to 1918, the between war period when life was raucous and liberated.  We then learn through their words and through film clips of the growing influence of Hitler and his own gay SA General, the response of  a people wilted from WWI needing hope for a future and not realizing the depravity of the promises of the Nazi party, the ugly truth.  It is this insidious perpetration of evil that becomes most pungent in the faces and words of the survivors.  This is  a beautifully realized documentary and one that will open eyes to a fact that most people remain unaware of even today.",N/A
598094,"After all the hype and comparisons to 'Steel Magnolias', 'Divine Secrets of the Ya-Ya Sisterhood', sadly, did not do much box office, which was a shame, as it is a more intimate, realistic vision of women and life-long friendships than the glossier 'Magnolias'.Four girl friends in Louisiana create a secret sisterhood in 1937, swearing eternal devotion to each other, and they remain best friends through all the triumphs and tragedies in their lives. When the daughter of one of them (Sandra Bullock), a successful playright, has an interview with Time magazine in which she blasts her mother's impact on her life, the mother (Ellen Burstyn, who is superb!) goes ballistic, cutting the daughter out of her life, totally. Into this maelstrom charges the other members of the Sisterhood, kidnapping Bullock, and attempting to make things right!The film then jumps back and forth in time, with Ashley Judd (who gives an Oscar-worthy performance) playing the younger Burstyn. She has a lot of happy adventures with her Ya-Ya sisters, but also has to deal with racism, a jealous religious zealot of a mother, an overly loving father (David Rasche, breaking free of his usual comic roles), a true love who dies in WWII, and a family with a guy she 'settles' for (played, in present day, by the wonderful James Garner). There is also a dark secret that is the core of the mother/daughter alienation, which must be dealt with in order for the rift between Bullock and Burstyn to heal (No, I will NOT give it away!)If you do the math about the years covered, you realize the present-day story SHOULD be taking place in the early nineties, at the latest, but this doesn't hurt the overall effectiveness of the picture. As the other present-day sisters, Fionnula Flanagan, Shirley Knight, and (especially) Maggie Smith are WONDERFUL, as is Angus MacFadyen, as Bullock's sympathetic and likable fiance.While this is unabashedly a 'chick flick', something I really liked was that they DIDN'T fall back on that old chestnut of somebody dying to serve as a convenient catalyst for change and the healing process. And the dialog is full of wickedly hilarious one-liners about men, alcohol, friendship, and growing old!Don't miss this gem!",N/A

Mike Myers does a wonderful job as 4 different characters including Austin Powers, Dr. Evil, Fat Bastard and the new addition - Goldmember.Beyonce Knowles did an OK job in her first movie role but the lack of on-screen chemistry between Foxxy Cleopatra and Austin Powers was disappointing. However, this was made up for by the laugh-a-minute humour that brought tears to my eyes! Fat Bastard was successfully reintroduced in his funniest scene ever and I saw some of the most hilarious, original humour that was far superior to that found in the first two installments of Austin Powers.The cameos in the opening credits were fantastic and especially entertaining and while the ending was a slight let-down, the jokes were A grade and the visual humour was outstanding.I would recommend this movie to any Austin Powers fan and even if you didn't particularly like the first two movies, you should see this one!

571808,"There is something wrong when both the worst and best parts of a DVD are to be found in the special features section. So it is with the case of ""Nurse Betty."" I am ambivalent at best about the actual movie. It left me feeling mildly entertained yet somehow slimed.I always like Morgan Freeman. It is amazing that he made me feel something for the horrid character he plays here. Likewise, I believe Greg Kinnear is one of the best male actors out there--but he is largely wasted in his role here (although his ""bad acting"" in the soap scenes is priceless).The largest problem I have with this movie is that there is no one to really like (with the possible exception of the reporter played by the guy who played Michael J. Fox's dad in Back to the Future). All of these characters are unredeeming. Even Betty, who spends most of the movie just being nuts, sells her soul in the end. The movie is just kind of pasty and tasteless.This brings me to the special features. The one thing I truly enjoyed about the DVD--which actually took me a few minutes to stop laughing over--was the ""soap opera episodes."" The opening sequence on each of them is just hysterical.However, that said--the deleted scenes are just wretched and disgusting (I guess the movie could have been a whole lot worse). The ""flap"" scene is one I wish I had not hit play for.All in all, ""Nurse Betty"" is a piece of wasted time I wish I could have back. I do not recommend it.",N/A

I like the industrial setting, absolutely love the music, and I find it to be a nice break from all the videos with complicated steps. The workout is not too strenuous, it gradually builds in intensity, and brings you to a good sweat. The moves in the beginning are very basic and easy, but after doing so many complicated videos, I liked getting back to the basics and not having to think real hard about how to copy what they're doing on tv. The music is really the best of any workout video I own, and I have about 20 of them. It's techno/electronic and really gets you moving.

393316,"Oh yes, this is my kind of movie!! It is a film that requires your complete attention to the actors on the screen; you've got to pay close attention to them because there is not any overt display of feelings/emotions until the very end of the movie. No chewing of the scenery--just superb acting! The eyes of Amanda Root and Ciarian Hinds (as Anne and Captain Wentworth) express a world of emotions--they simply speak volumes. There is not a great deal of ""physical action"" in this film. On the surface, everthing is sooooooo proper, refined and controlled; however, there's ""loads"" going on emotionally inside the characters and that is expressed completely through the actors' eyes and facial expressions. Amanda Root and Ciarian Hinds performances just blew me away! If you are not watching Root's eyes (as Anne) when she first sees Captain Wentworth, you will miss completely what he has meant to her, what he still means to her and what the movie is about--it's all portrayed in her eyes. Ciarian Hinds, as Captian Wentworth, at first keeps ""his cool"" doing the macho thing and not giving the audience a hint of what Anne has meant and stills means to him. But watch that facade start to crumble--again portrayed in his eyes. Some reviewers on this board find Hinds' portrayal of the captain as too distant and cold. I don't. Remember, he was the one rejected by Anne and, to me, he's putting on that ""I'll show her"" routine. But as I previously stated that soon changes and you really find out how much he still loves her.I just love acting of this caliber. For me, you can forget the actors that chew up scenery. Give me the ones that can stun you with their depth of emotion and feeling through subtle means of expression--Amanda Root and Ciarian Hinds are such actors.

586437,"It's the day before the Oscars, and I very much needed to rent this film, being a Denzel fan from way back, and I saw A BEAUTIFUL MIND and thought Crowe was swell. It's good to see Denzel playing a baddasss, because, with the exception of ""Courage Under Fire"", he'd always been maybe just a bit too perfect. This shows range & depth; truly a committed performance. The real star, though, is Ethan Hawke, who never really impressed me before. Putting him up against Denzel's brilliant performance is a true test of acting greatness. I'm sure this type of thing goes on in Police Dept's somewhere, and it's unnerving to think it does; I'm sure production would've been prevented if it hit too many true notes. The film is exciting, suspenseful, and the acting throughout is excellent. The DVD has a crisp 2.35:1 Widescreen, and characters portrayed by Dr. Dre & Snoop Dogg are quite fine, proving other areas of talent. I'm impressed with this film, and I think Denzel should win the Oscar, as well as Hawke (though he won't, cuz he's the dark-horse...I hope I'm wrong...)

269155,"Yeah, that's a reference to the one narrative device that everyone who's seen WIZARDS retains. Saw this on its original release, well-toasted (as was the entire audience, come to think of it), but it's that years-later second viewing that really hammers home how awful WIZARDS truly is. A long narrated still-frame introduction prepares you for one sort of movie - as soon as the animation begins, we get another one entirely. It appears to be a crude retelling of WW2 recast in a ridiculous standoff of ""magic vs technology"" - of course the good guys, led by a lame wizard who might've resulted had Robert Crumb storyboarded the COLUMBO series, represent ""magic"". The Secret Weapon of the bad guys which provides all the dramatic conflict (by paralyzing the forces of Niceness into immobility during battle) turns out to be Super-8 movies of Hitler; these mixed-media segments play more like mixed-up media. By the time the ridiculously overdramatic narrator returns to wrap it up with, ""At last, Hitler was dead, again..."", only the very very dim could fail to Get It (and a note here to all elf-lovin' fantasy nerds: I know you hate having to face up to this, bu-u-ut....Hitler's ""technology"" was defeated not by ""magic"" and ""nature"" but by our own ""technology"": mellow-harshing buzz-killers like bullets, tanks, planes, incendiaries, the splitting of the atom, etc. Weren't very many giggling lapdancers in dental-floss lingerie at Normandy Beach, to say nothing of stogie-chewing elves, Churchill notwithstanding.) This puerility of vision - ZAP Comics trying but never actually meeting Tolkien - is dreary enough, but the animation makes it more painful still. The rotoscoping is inferior to what the Fleischers had achieved a generation earlier, and its willy-nilly insertion into the 'regular' animated segments, which resemble Nelvana on a bad day, is jarringly amateurish. There are a few saving moments of humor here (""They killed Fritz!""), but they too seem out of place. MEAN STREETS fans might want to check it out, though, as two of the voices are provided by that movie's Richard Romanus & David Proval. Too bad y'can't mute the PICTURE in this case, though.

While you hear the background music in this great film you will almost hear the beautiful words being sung with the chemistry that these two actors portray.This comedy duel soon changes to more serious acting as the story progresses and you find yourself just as much in love as they are with each other.

Yoko Kanno, the composer, uses a number of different musical styles, from jazz, to hard jungle, each style fitting the on-screen situations perfectly. It's not a traditional mix, however, and you'll find soft, thoughtful ballads accompanying deadly chases through space, instead of the usual, more &quot;exciting&quot; music.The harmony of the visual style, the soundtrack, and the excellent (often humorous) writing achieves a sort of synaethasia that most works of art can only hope to achieve.

Tom Hanks (Forrest Gump) is a slow-witted (perhaps mildly retarded) southern boy with ""crooked legs"" who has two great gifts - the first is always looking for the good in any situation or in any person he meets, and the second is the ability to so totally focus on the task at hand that he completely immerses himself into whatever he takes on. His childhood friend and the later object of his affections, Jenny (Robin Wright) is a woman of average intelligence who is very unfocused, or ""into everything.""The computer generated newsreel footage that splices Gump into so many archived moments is worth seeing this film for, but the gentle humor and poignant story of a love that endures great divides of time and distance make it an awesome experience.Both Robert Zemeckis (Best Director) and Tom Hanks (Best Actor) won Academy Awards for this film, which I still think is one of the most powerful movies of our time.",N/A

""Armageddon"" was ""Top Gun"" for the 90s. And I'm a Ben Affleck fan. When I rented this movie, I found it was no different from Bay's others: loud, flashy, and vacuous. But during the middle hour, the damndest thing happened: I actually became glued to my seat. This was no doubt due to the outstanding attack scenes, and the hardships of the young men in the Arizona. And to think, it only took the gross national product of a small country to recreate the real-life horrors that the survivors have been trying forever to forget.

386471,"It's hard to see this film today with the eyes of twenty years ago. Its techniques and even its very images have been used for everything from car commercials to MTV videos to other movies. That's Hollywood for you. But Koyaanisqatsi was a fresh, eye-popping film when it came out, and holds up well considering. (Of course, it may owe a debt to some unlikely sources as well: that the ending of ""The Grid"" is a lot like the ""Star Gate"" sequence in Kubrick's 2001.) Whether or not you buy into the film's premise--and even Reggio seems over the years to have backed off on his initial statements that indicted technology--it's quite an intense visceral experience. Reggio doesn't want to debate with you; he wants to bedazzle you. That requires your brain to be hypnotized, even numbed, and so he was right to use Glass' minimalist music. I still don't get the point of the cave paintings that open and close the film--what they are, how they tie in with the rest of the movie. I presume they are Hopi, but since nothing else in the film is Hopi other than the title, and since Reggio could have showed us *any* Hopi artifact (or Hopi, for that matter), this element seems a little out of place. If he's trying to say simple Hopi life is better, it's a weak statement. Or is he saying any simple life is better period? If so, why show just Hopi artifacts? --Except that, he never really says anything about the Hopi side anyway, or the cave paintings, so again, they seem a little out of place.More stunning are images of taxiing 747s coming at us relentlessly. Or a woman in a department store standing mesmerized before a bank of television sets. Or rows upon rows upon rows upon rows of identical project housing in St. Louis. Or a shot of congested freeways that pans up to a billboard for ""fun in the sun."" Or an aircraft carrier that flippantly and--to me--arrogantly displays ""E-Mc2"" across its surface. And of course, the last shot is really special, but I won't spoil it for anyone who hasn't seen the film.Yet despite its undeniable visual impact, I think there is a serious flaw in Reggio's film, one that he now tries to backpedal on. I remember when this film was released in 1983 and it was never discussed then as a possible ode to technology. Reggio wanted us to look at the pictures of the smokestacks and land-diggers and skyscrapers and recoil. Philip Glass even confirmed at a recent talk on the film that if Reggio is saying now that he wanted to present technology in all its shining glory, the ""belly of the beast,"" so to speak, he's changing his tune. The film, it can be argued (and Roger Ebert, for one, has argued) doesn't work because we aren't shown enough of the ugly side of technology, we are oftentimes in this movie simply shown technology and expected to find the sight off-putting. Many people in Third World countries, as Glass pointed out, think the ""Grid"" sequemence is the most glorious part of the movie.The transfer to DVD is good. Some people below are complaining about some of the images not being great when they fail to realize much of it is stock shots blown up from 16mm. (A lot of the ""Vessels"" video falls into this category, for example.) This film will never look as good its sequels anyway because when Reggio started he wasn't thinking of theatrical release, nor did he have the budget for it.As for the rest of the DVD, I would have liked to see some more ""goodies""--the 25 minute interview with Glass and Reggio is okay, but only okay, and most of it consists of Reggio's talking head. (And boy, can that guy talk. To think he once took a vow of silence as a monk boggles the mind. Maybe he's making up for lost time.) There are trailers for all the ""Qatsi"" films and--incredibly--subtitles in French and Spanish. They merely translate the meaning of the word ""Koyaanisqatsi"" at the end of the film, as well as the ""Prophecies"" that, if you ask me, are best left untranslated. Some people have had issues with the audio remix. Sounds good to me--more balanced than the original theatrical release and VHS tape, which tended to be loud and shrill in the horns, especially in the ""Pruit Igoe"" section. I listened to the DVD both on audiophile headphones and [top-of-the-line] loudspeakers and my only complaint is the volume level is low. I had to ""blast"" my receiver to get average room volume.Overall, though, this is a welcome release since the last home video dub was that fuzzy VHS tape from about 1986. MGM should have done a better job with extras--the whole presentation looks a little quick and shoddy. As for the debate about the matting, again MGM could have solved this easily, if they'd been thinking, by simply encoding the film in its TV ratio on one side of the disc and its movie ratio on the other side, as many other DVDs in my collection are presented. I wish the Criterion people would have gotten their hands on this--they'd have done it right. I have a feeling someday after the release of the third film, they'll box them all up and issue a ""Special Slipcase Edition"" or whatever, with extras that should have been here in the first place.

144728,"The tagline for the film &quot;Jezebel&quot; was &quot;The South's Greatest Love Story,&quot; which certainly reflects the same sort of audacity Robert E. Lee evinced at the battle of Chancellorsville since pretty much everybody in the United States was reading &quot;Gone With the Wind&quot; in 1938 and wondering when David O. Selznick was going to cast someone as Scarlett O'Hara and start making the movie.  Bette Davis was not going to get to play Scarlett so instead she Julie Marsden, another Southern belle with a fiery temper.  The Academy certainly did not think she was playing a second-rate Scarlett O'Hara, because Davis earned the Oscar for Best Actress that year.Since it is impossible not to hear the echoes of Margaret Mitchell's novel in the plot of &quot;Jezebel,&quot; just enjoy the ride.  It seems that Julie is upset with her fiance Preston Dillard (Henry Fonda), and intends to embarrass him at the Olympus Ball, the main social event in New Orleans where their engagement will be formally announced.  Instead of wearing the traditional white gown worn by unmarried women, Scarlett shows up in a Julie dress, I mean Julie shows up in a red dress (unfortunately this is a black &amp; white film, but you get the idea).  However, her gambit backfires, the engagement is broken, and three years later Ashley, I mean, Preston arrives at Miss Julie's plantation with his bride Melanie, I mean, Amy (Margaret Lindsay).  The climax of the film comes when a yellow fever epidemic sweeps New Orleans and strikes down Preston.  Will Miss Julie risk her life to care for the man she loves?  Hey, this is the south's greatest romance, is it not?  By its own admission.You might find Fonda a bit stilted as a dashing Southern gentleman, but this is Bette's film from start to finish.  Both director William Wyler and Warner Bros' Studios helped fashion a superior character study with solid production values.  Wyler would go on to direct Davis to other noted successes in &quot;The Letter&quot; (1940) and &quot;The Little Foxes&quot; (1941).  Of course, Vivien Leigh would win the Oscar the following year and the two roles certainly have in common the fact they could not possibly have been viewed with more a critical eye by movie audiences.Best Romantic Lines: (1) &quot;I'm terribly sorry to be late.

727881,"Quick Overview:  This DVD is both an excellent survey of U2's music during the past decade and a fascinating anthology of music videos, both conceptual and performance.  Musically, it contains all of the songs from the regular release of the CD ""U2: The Best of 1990-2000"", with the exception that ""For the First Time"" is replaced by ""The Fly"".  In addition, it contains seven bonus tracks, songs lamented by many for not being included on the CD.  Cinematically, it boasts both performance and conceptual videos of varying quality; with the inclusion of intriguing director commentaries, many of the videos merit multiple viewings.  Alternate videos for ""Even Better Than The Real Thing"", ""One"", ""Stuck in a Moment..."", ""Staring at the Sun"", and ""Numb"" are provided to yield a total of 28 music videos for 23 songs.  As a special treat, three documentaries are included.  All in all, this is an amazing DVD.Details, Shot One (""Conceptual Videos""):  The most successful conceptual videos are ""Numb"" (Godley version), ""Please"", and ""If God Will Send His Angels"".  The ""Numb"" video bluntly demonstrates the cause of The Edge's numbness--it's also quite funny and disturbing.  ""Please"" and ""If God Will Send His Angels"" are probably my favorites.  Bono's performance in ""Please"" is poignant, and the gimic employed by Corbijn works well here.  The use of split screen and altered film speed in ""If God Will Send..."" effectively communicates that awful out-of-sync feeling of being alone among people, even among friends.""One"" deserves special mention.  Three videos were made for this.  Pellington's version, employed in concert, emphasized buffalos, images of which adorn both the CD and DVD; sadly, this video was NOT included on the DVD.  The other two videos are here, and they are interesting.  Corbijn's version is notable for having Bono's father playing a major role; in addition, you get to decide which member of U2 would make the most attractive woman--I don't think it's Bono.Details, Shot Two (""Performance Videos""):  What would U2 be without footage of them on stage?  Many of these videos, including conceptual ones, feature perforance footage.  Some, like ""Gone"" and ""Mofo"", are essentially concert videos; I prefer watching these songs on the Zoo TV and PopMart videos.  Others, like ""Even Better Than the Real Thing"", ""Mysterious Ways"", and ""Staring at the Sun"", utilize novel filming techniques tobolster the song's mood or message.  Some are more successful than others.  For example, at first boring, the strange effects in ""Staring at the Sun"" (Scott version) become almost revelatory at the end.  In ""Please"" and ""One"", expressions on The Edge's face at key points of the video are very telling and make the inclusion of performance footage mandatory.One Drop of Sad:  These are minor quibbles.  1)  Navigation is sometimes frustrating.  You click on the director's name and you get either the video OR the video with commentary.  If you click on the triangle beside his name, you definitely get commentary.  If you have the same trouble, keep trying; eventually, you will get the straight video.  2)  With ""Mofo"", I had to try accessing the video several times before I heard the soundtrack.  ""Mofo"" was the only video with which I had this problem.  3)  Although the box claims subtitles in five languages, I did not find Japanese subtitles actually provided for the songs I checked, and I checked most of them.  4)  Some songs, like ""Beautiful Day"" and ""One"", had alternate videos.  It would have been nice to have ALL versions.  (This is a BEST OF anthology, so maybe they only included the best of the alternates?)Extra Tidbits:  The DVD booklet provides interesting, albeit short, notes on each song.  The DVD package provides storage space for the U2 The History Mix DVD, that came with the special edition of ""The Best of 1990-2002"" CD.In Summary:  This is an outstanding DVD.  It contains most, arguably the best, of the singles from 1990-2000 with their videos, all of which contain something of at least passing interest and some of which are very powerful.  The director commentaries are fascinating and provide valuable behind-the-scenes information.  The documentaries are a nice addition.  I highly recommend ""U2: The Best of 1990-2002""; it's one of the best DVDs I've bought this year.",N/A
105876,"With the news that WB has decided to release the original Batman animated episodes, SubZero, World's Finest, and ROTJ Uncut, it seemed only right to revisit The Batman Superman Movie, AKA World's Finest. This movie was originally three episodes of the animated Superman series, and featured the first meeting of Batman and Superman. The team-up was so well-recieved that the creators later featured teamups between Superman and Robin, Superman and Green Lantern, and a host of others.I'll be the first to admit that when I heard about Batman and Superman in the same episode, I wasn't thrilled. Up until that point I was strictly a Batman fan, and Batman's world seemed to be such a contrast of Superman's that I failed to see how any team-up could work. I was also reminded of the cheesy 'Superfriends' from the 70's and 80's. What annoyed me the most, however, was that the creators seemed to have altered they way they animated the new Batman series just so they could fit Batman and Superman together without making it seem awkward. Most fans tend to agree that the original 'dark-deco' style is superior to the new one.While I wasn't too impressed with The Batman Superman Movie the first time I watched it, it's grown on me and I've come to love it as much as the other Batman movies. The creators (Paul Dini and Bruce Timm) were really careful to balance the two superheroes. Superman is physically superior and the story takes place on his home turf, but Batman has the toys and the knowledge of how Joker thinks. When you watch their initial meeting and how each discovers the others' identity, you'll realize that each can hold their own, and the way they each overcome obstacles serves as a good character study of the two heroes.The villains are equally compelling and balanced as well. Luthor has the resources and the intelligence, while Joker has the insanity needed to start their plan in motion. Even moreso than Batman and Superman, we never really think of these two villians teaming up in a buddy-buddy fashion; It's more like a symbiosis, and the tension between Joker and Lex adds another plot twist, as the Joker's insanity is destroying LexCorp property and putting Luthor under suspicion. There is an ample amount of violence here as well. Batman and Superman were one of the last cartoon series' to have characters fire real guns (as opposed to sci-fi-ish laser pistols). Besides the heightened realism from actual gunplay, there are several explosions and scenes of destruction, and some of what the Joker does is really twisted (though not as twisted as ROTJ).With this movie coming to DVD April 23, 2002, all fans should pick up a copy. The disc has a few extra features (though nothing truly substantial), but the movie is great fun, and serves as a prelude to Cartoon Network's Justice League.",N/A

Danny Woodburn does a great job as the chief &quot;little person&quot; on the Smoochy show.  The comic premise of the movie sounded promising, but it's weighed down by a leaden script, with a silly and unfunny gangster subplot and an utterly unbelievable romantic plot thrown in. The film generates maybe half a dozen chuckles in all.  The DVD includes a commentary by director Danny deVito which is largely devoted to telling how much fun the movie was to make.  Too bad it's not much fun to watch.",Death To Smoochy
698309,"Jeunet has done it again, this time apparently without the help of his usual partner, Marc Caro.Amelie is a perfectly French film, demonstrating the French knack for finding beauty in the mundane and accepting human frailty.  Poor little Amelie grew up with somewhat loving but eccentric and unapproachable parents.. Her childhood social life and family situation has made her into a painfully shy but compassionate young woman.  She has retained her childish way of finding likes and dislikes -- another French specialty? -- and instead of making judgments on practical bases, she makes decisions with her intuition.  She intuits her role in life, her lovelife -- you'd guess she probably picked her place of residence based on the grain of wood on the balustrade.This is a character you will root for; you will talk to her as she struggles with her bizarre insecurities; you will applaud her clever mischief; your heart will ache joyfully when she succeeds in her first mission of giving meaning to another person.. (you'll know what I mean when you see it) I have to say, if you don't care about this beautiful creature, your heart is defective.All that aside, Jeunet works his usual magic with stop-motion, animation, slow-mo, various effects, highly stylized dream sequences put into documentary format.  Of course the performances are all perfect as usual, and there is at least one &quot;usual suspect&quot; on the credits.I was foolish enough to miss this one in the theatre, but luckily decided to take the time to see it on DVD..

First , for those of you that have a sentimental side for manhunter, let me tell you that this is a completely diferent film and stay pretty clean in not to overcome manhunter's greatness. i find red dragon to be more into the serial killer background his insanity. Manhunter is more about catching the killer and detective's  will graham uncontrolable desire to get the killer. i do find pettersen's performance as will graham more aprochable to the character than edward norton's....pettersen is more frantic and suspenful, norton is more pasive and less misterious but he did a great job,  is just that i like pettersen character better. As for lector, well in red dragon it goes back to lecter....and again it have nothing to compare to manhunter.

537804,"`Save The Last Dance' is a movie about Sara, who hopes to win a place at Julliard to do ballet.  However, when her mother dies in a car crash she goes to live with her father and becomes one of the only white people at her new school, forgetting about ballet altogether.  Feeling an outsider at first she befriends the popular Chenille and becomes interested in her brother Derek.  Before long Sara and Derek are seeing each other and her old love of ballet is reawakened, influenced by the hip-hop and rap that her friends listen to.Although the romance and the reawakening of Sara's dream is obvious enough, it is its refusal to skirt the tricky issues not often dealt in teen movies.  Chenille's baby, the estranged father and arguments concerning race are all in there alongside the beautiful faces, dancing, fighting and kissing.  It's true that it's a distinctly average movie on several levels but it should be credited by giving a realistic interpretation of teenage life amidst racial tension.  For example, the inevitable fight between Sara and Derek takes place not so much because of Derek's ex (Bianca Lawson - Kendra from `Buffy The Vampire Slayer'), but because of the friction that Sara causes with Derek's friends and family.  It may all lead to a sappy conclusion but it's a rare teen move that will show a shoot-out and a mother still at school.",N/A
530478,"I didn't have HBO when The Sopranos came out in 1999, and so I am delighted that it is now on a set of DVD discs.  I'm a big fan of books and movies about the Mafia and so I was prepared to love it. I must say that my expectations were all met, and more.  There is nothing like being able to watch the series, in its entirety, all at once, at my own pace.  And there is nothing like watching several video interviews and behind the scenes featurettes on the discs to enhance the viewing experience with background information.  This series has won many awards.  I can understand why.James Gandofini stars as Tony Soprano, a very human individual, who just happens to be a gangster.  He's living in modern times though, and so he's plagued with depression and goes to a therapist, played by Lorraine Bracco.  Tony's domestic scenes, which include his wife, Edie Falco, his daughter, Jamie-Lyn Sigler, his son, Robert Iler, and - especially his mother, Nancy Marchand, are all unique and slightly off-center examples of brilliant writing and editing.  Add to this his criminal activities and his violent temper, and there's a mix that fascinates me completely.One of the delights of the series is that I can't quite figure what will happen next. I'm constantly on edge as I watch the story unfold, and there are always surprises.  I like the humor and the irreverence.  And best of all I like the fact that each episode is commercial free and a complete movie in itself.  I love it when the scenes move back and forth between the actual crime stuff and his family life.  And I love the humanity that Tony exhibits.  In a way he is &quot;everyman&quot; as he struggles with decisions and hard choices in his life.  And yet, he is larger than life, and a bit of a hero to our culture.  Couple this with really fine acting and an excellent script, and a winner emerges.I'm not into dream sequences and these were the only parts that dragged down the action, but there were only a very few throughout all the episodes.  However, now that I look back on it, I'm glad they were there, because even though I was annoyed with them at the time, I can now see how they really helped develop the characters.  These on-target characterizations are what drive the series and make it soar above its nearest competitors.  The Sopranos on DVD is a winner in every sense of the world.  And it is not only recommended for aficionados of the gangster genre.  It gets my highest recommended for everyone.",N/A

After seeing the cover art of the video box, I thought this must be a movie filled with special effects, showing the destruction of the planet after a large asteroid impacts.  Instead, deep impact takes on a different meaning.  It doesn't refer to the deep impact of an asteroid (which is really a comet instead)  but refers to the deep impact this event has on human society.  What you get with Deep Impact is an emotional story with a lot of meaning.  Don't expect a whole lot of special effetcs until the very end, only a minute or two.  If you prefer a movie with more action, Armageddon may be the one to watch.  But if you want a movie with a lot of heart, Deep Impact my friend.",Deep Impact VHS

The victims are JoBeth Williams and Craig T. Nelson and his kids, specially the little daughter who is capturated by the ghosts.We get really scared with some scenes in the kids' room with the alive tree attacking. We even get a pause when the ghostbusters leaded by Beatrice Straight and a midget woman appear.The final attack is particularly frightening, with all that difficulties of getting out of the house, but it can't get out of my mind the  time the midget said ""This house is clean"". Too early to say that, I think--One thing that also confuded me was JoBeth Williams being so young and having already a 17 year old daughter!Overall, a nice spooky flick, but not the best of the genre.",Poltergeist
538563,"Heartbreakers is a simple little movie with a simple little storyline. While it is a typical, by the numbers kind of a comedy film, it is still a pretty pleasant and modestly entertaining film. Not exactly one that will still be in your memory a while from now. Except for the ample bossom that is on full display here. Sigourney Weaver and Jennifer Love Hewitt star as a mother-daughter con artist team who go to Palm Beach for one last big hit. They plan to attract billionaire Gene Hackman, who is in horrible health, so the mom can marry him and the daughter can set him up in a compromising way for the mom to catch and...voila!...instant money!. But, as usual, things go horribly wrong as the luscious duo try to correct things. All of the stars here are obviously game. Weaver is very good in her role as Angela. She definitley has a nice knack for comedy that she doesn't get to show off too often. A nice performance from a great actress. Hewitt also benefits here. Sure, her cleavage and, well, her whole body is amply on display in hot poses and clothes, but she does a good job. Her character wanting to break away from mommy dearest, only to realize it's a hard world out there on your own. This is a definite plus for her career. It should open her up to BIGGER and BETTER things. Plus, she's sexy as all hell here. Hackman is ridiculously silly. He's made up to look really awful and it works. Another performer not known for goofy comedy who pulls it off nicely. Ray Liotta is on hand as a victim of the duo's cons. He's an intense actor, but he lightens up here in a comedic role. Jason Lee also stars as a bar owner that Hewitt falls in love with. His role is pretty typical. Not given much to do. It's a predictable film really. I don't think anybody won't know how it turns out. Weaver and Hewitt are really good together. They look as if they could actually be mother and daughter. The only good thing a Heartbreakers 2 would bring is these two back together. Nora Dunn, Jeffrey Jones, Ann Bancroft co-star, with a cameo by Carrie Fisher and SNL's Kevin Nealon. If all else fails, you get the great shots of Ms. Hewitt in all her glory. Did I mention how sexy she is?. Our two stars just barely make it work. Just barely.",N/A
525752,"Let me start off by saying that I am a fan of the Harry Potter book series.  I did sincerely hope that the movie would follow the book, because many big screen book adaptators take creative license to visualize their own interpretation.  In other words, they mess it up.  Overall, I was pleased with the first book's giant leap to the big screen, in spite of a few minor discrepancies.First of all, every actor hired to play a part in this movie was perfectly suited for his or her role.  Daniel Radcliffe IS Harry Potter!  If I ever see him on the street, where he will undoubtedly be mobbed by thirteen-year-old girls, I will probably slip up and call him Harry a few times!  I do hope that little guy becomes a big star and not just the next Macaulay Culkin.  He seems like a good kid.As I was saying, now when I read the other novels, I can picture these actors and actresses in my mind.  Bravo to the casting directors for giving accurate visual representations of the characters.  And another bravo to the actors themselves for doing an excellent job all around.The special effects in this film were fantastic, especially in the Quidditch scene.  It is SO much better to see this game played out on the big screen than to read about it in the book.  You can never quite see the action in your head while reading, so this movie pieces that scene together for you.  That is why I call this movie ""a great supplement to the book.""  It fills in gaps where your imagination may not have been so strong.This film is destined to be a kid-movie classic, right alongside films like ""The Wizard of Oz"" and ""Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory.""  Not many kid-movies are for kids anymore ...but this one is relatively safe to show in schools on Movie Day Friday or during recess.  ""Harry Potter"" has brought a little respectability back to the children's films genre.The story is great and magical with some very true-to-life themes about uniqueness, bravery, and friendship.  Yes, there were a few moments that didn't stick to the book, namely Hermione's exclusion from the final challenge, but I couldn't help but feel like the movie at least did the book justice.  I understand that screenwriting is a difficult process that does not allow for everything in a book to be included in the film version.  That's the way it goes.As far as the DVD is concerned, the movie transfer and sound is very excellent, but the special features aren't so special.  I enjoyed the deleted scenes, but I did not enjoy the mess of a maze I had to endure to unlock them.  A word to the wise: find a website that specializes in DVD easter eggs.  Print out the directions to finding the deleted scenes and follow them to save time and frustration.In the meantime, enjoy this first installment in what will prove to be a very profitable franchise.  I know lots of people, myself included, who are DYING to see ""Chamber of Secrets.""  It's addictive!",N/A
700931,"Bullets of Love is a Hong Kong action movie that has many very tender moments and even a few funny moments.  Hong Kong action star/singer Leon Lai plays a Hong Kong detective who, along with his prosecutor fiance (Asaka Seto), fights a nasty Hong Kong gang.

Bullets of Love has the action and tongue-in-cheek humor you'd expect from a movie of this genre, but Japanese TV actress Asaka Seto is so effective at being both brutal and tender she is able to play different characters with the same face.

540288,"As a big Kubrick fan, I was excited to see this movie.  The first third of the movie was really well done (probably because it was the most Kubrikesque).  The emotional complexity was really intriguing.  Here you have an artificially created child who seems to exhibit human emotion, so you want to like him, yet he's just not quite human enough to really love.  Haley Joel Osment exhibits dynamic acting ability as the deadpan meta boy.  Very impressive.After setting up a great premise, the movie takes a ridiculous ride that refuses to end.  The focus shifts from an intriguing, intellectual film, to a futuristic chase movie.  This I found to be quite boring.  And just when you think the movie is about to end, it keeps going with a new weird twist, each more ludicrous than the previous.  And of course it ends with the classic Spielberg ending where all the loose ends are tied up a little too nicely.My analysis: the first hour is good Kubrick cinema, the last 90 minutes are Spielberg's hopeless attempts to imitate Kubrick.  Fans of this movie like it because they think it is so intellectual, but really only the first part is.  Anyone who has seen a good &quot;intellectual&quot; film would know this film does not belong in that category.  A.I. is not worth the time, you'd be much better off watching Blade Runner or Kubrick's 2001 Space Odessey.",N/A
520877,"Once upon a time, space missions used to be manned with reliable personnel, real professionals who knew the details of their task to the ""t"". But then Arthur Clarke teamed up with Gentry Lee and wrote a sequel to ""Rama"", which showed everyone that it was a lot more fun to populate spaceships with bickering incompetents who had no reason to be up in space in the first place.Thus, essentially, the early scene where the crew are introduced in terms of their occupations and personality trait (singular - i.e., ""Burchenal - one of the world's greatest bioengineers and his own greatest hero"") is monumentally superfluous. We already know these people. We've read about them, seen them on TV. We know most of them are going to die. They really are that stupid. They raid the chemicals cabinet to make moonshine, prompting the line that will live on in infamy: ""A billion dollars of taxpayer money on this mission and you're using the lab equipment as a still?"" As if we didn't get it, there is a scene of the male crewmembers urinating on Mars (they are amused by the low gravity).The best aspect of ""Red Planet"" is its surprising tenacity. It faithfully follows in the footsteps of its predecessors, and is almost old-fashioned. For all intents and purposes it is hard science fiction, and does not feel any compunction to resort to either action comedy (""Armageddon"") or over-the-top special effects (""Mission to Mars""), except for a silly, protracted scene of Bowman venting the ship of fire. The premise is not to save stranded comrades or anything that promises any inane action sequences. The mission's sole goal is to find out what happened to the terraforming algae. Moreover, ""Red Planet"" consistently generates momentum and wrings a measure of drama from this sparse and underwhelming plot. There is a touching scene where the crew almost run out of air and sit resignedly waiting to die, and a crash landing sequence that's as much movie as music video. Mars's surface is magnificent in its atmospheric reality, and the spaceship, Mars-1, seems to have come straight out of one of Clarke's novels, right down to Lucille, the computer voice that echoes the crew.Sadly, while a lot of good can be said about ""Red Planet,"" it is by no means a masterpiece. It fits together so neatly it falls a bit flat. Toward the end the plot wears thin and the underlying cliches begin to show. In hindsight, the discovery that the entire plot depends on the berserk AMEE continually playing a deadly game of cat-and-mouse with the crew is rather disappointing. And while the initial question of ""where have the algal mats gone?"" is answered, the explanation is even more baffling than the question.In the end, ""Red Planet"" is neither particularly memorable or exciting. Better human dramas and loftier science fiction have been filmed. ""Red Planet"" sets no benchmark, though it's still a solidly entertaining experience.",N/A

This is one of the funniest comedies ever made  and few people have even heard of it.Everyone's seen ""Some Like it Hot"" (I HOPE!) but even die-hard Billy Wilder fans have missed out on this one.Like ""The Apartment"" it's co-written by Wilder and I.A.L. Diamond, stars Jack Lemmon and Shirley MacLaine and is directed by the man himself.There's one big difference, though. ""The Apartment"" has been justly acclaimed as a masterpiece of cinema, but despite what critics have written about it, it is NOT a 'romantic comedy.' It's a drama. A poignant love story with a happy ending.This one's a screwball comedy.  A first class farce.But, that's another story . . .",Irma La Douce VHS
438137,"This made-for-tv film is a realistic, funny, inspiring, sad, &amp; honest picture about the Spanish-American War.  This movie is actually able to romanticize &quot;the glories&quot; of war while also being brutally honest about America's hypocrisy, prejudices, &amp; horrors of war, especially at the close of the 19th Century.All of the performers are great, &amp; I like the plot about a bandit from the Wild West (Arizona) who, in order to escape a posse, joins the Arizona Volunteers.  His reasons are selfish, but then, while fighting &amp; suffering alongside others, he finds true self-respect &amp; willingness to give, not just take, to others.  (His bandit-partner also finds this self-respect, but unfortunatelly, pays the ultimate price.)The highlight of the movie, however, is the film's co-producer, Tom Berringer as Teddy Roosevelt!  He has usually been relegated to tough, working-class type of characters (the last episodes of &quot;Cheers&quot;, &quot;Last Of The Dogmen&quot;), but this movie proves that he is a capable, versatile, &amp; talented actor, capable of both character &amp; depth!  (This movie proves that if you as an actor/actress don't want to be type-cast, you've got to take matters into your own hands.)  My only suggestion for the film-makers is...show this movie again on TNT!  Too many people have not heard of this film &amp; one showing in 1997 wasn't really enough.  This film is too good to be forgotten &amp; people deserve to know about it.  (Maybe get an endorsement from teacher's associations, so it could be shown in school history classes.  With the events of the last year, this movie is especially poignant today.)As Roosevelt would have said, &quot;Bully for Berringer!&quot;",Rough Riders VHS

465104,"Oh my gosh! A war film that doesn't:A. Make us cryB. Make us want to pick up a rifle and join the armyC. Make us shout, ""hoora"" as we watch yet another glorious blood and guts scene featuring the noble aspect of honor, duty, and sacrifice.What will we ever do?!?I know, maybe we should try thinking for the first time in our lives when we watch a film. How 'bout that?This film doesn't focus on the glamor or the spoils of war. It strays from the glorious charge, the valiant assault on the hill leading to a splendid celebration in the ranks, the bronze medals or silver stars. No, it doesn't do those things at all. Instead, we get to see a very diverse group of characters, from a dreamy private who sees the good in all to a cold hearted Colonel who wants nothing more than to earn another rank. We see the vast diversity of all the many types of men who embody a soldier.When there are death scenes we do not cry. We feel a total lack of emotion and feeling. In that way, Malick does a wonderful trick, bulldozing all the war movie cliches that have become common practice in mainstream Hollywood. We feel the total lack of feeling that many veterans today feel.At one point, a character states: ""War don't enoble men, it turns 'em into dogs.""  The idea here is that war, in and of itself, is like choosing poison. To kill for the sake of good is still the shedding of blood. This idea if further demonstrated when Caviezal's character stares at a dead Japanese soldier, imagining what the soldier might be saying. The dead soldier states: ""Are you loved by all? Know that I was too. Do you imagine your sufferings will be less because you loved truth, justice?""And again, while the soldiers are invading a Japanese camp, we here yet another thought from Caviezal's dreamy character stating: ""This great evil, where's it come from. From what root, what seed was it planted? Who's doing this to us? Who's killing us? Do you walk in this night too?""Skeptics will quickly brush off such poetry as mere rhetoric. I beg to differ. Such ideas are solid measuring points on humanity, the idea of evil, and the idea of war. After all,  where do morals derive from? One man's good is another man's evil and the common evil in this film appears to be war itself.This film is not for everyone but it does convey some powerful statements throughout the 3+ hours of viewing time. Take note: if you enjoy thinking films, this will suffice. There are no clear cut ideas here, but more of a search as you go feeling. By the time you've seen it(twice might be necessary), your ideas of war, morality, and the classic concepts of duty, nobility, and honor might not be the same anymore.I give this film an A+ for actually taking a stand and sticking with it, even though Saving Private Ryan lovers, classic skeptics, and ""color it for me"" movie lovers blast it left and right.",The Thin Red Line VHS
707039,"Right before the opening credits hit in ""All About The Benjamins,"" there is a moment where star/writer/producer Ice Cube takes a tazer to a man's genitals. It's rather appropriate, because if you're not a fan of Mr. Cube's, ""Benjamins"" will feel about as comfortable to sit through as that tazer's sting.""Benjamins"" stars Ice Cube as bounty hunter Bucum Jackson, sent on assignment to recover a bail jumper named Reggie Wright (Mike Epps). Reggie is in deep trouble. Not only did he witness a diamond theft and murder, but he also left his wallet - containing a winning lottery ticket - at the scene of the crime. Reggie's only help is Bucum, but the grumpy bounty hunter wants nothing to do with the felon, that is until 20 million in stolen diamonds becomes up for grabs.I'll give him this much: Ice Cube certainly knows his audience. ""All About The Benjamins"" is as familiar Cube terrain as a movie can get, filled to the breaking point with the fireballs, profanity and ad-libbed laughs that made his previous two ""Friday"" films such hits. However, this time out, Cube and his team are trying to resuscitate the buddy film genre, long since laid to rest in the land of straight-to-video releases. ""Benjamins"" is an old-school, Joel Silveresque actioner, circa 1991. It delightfully traffics in the business of over-the-top villains, gorgeous females, constant shoot-outs and one explosion after another. Long gone are the weed and sex jokes of the ""Friday"" films, here replaced with bullets and a bigger budget.Somehow, first time director Kevin Bray makes this work, if only slightly. A highly energized, stylishly directed film that actually features a perfect mood setting opening credit sequence, ""Benjamins"" can at least serve as eye candy if nothing else. The editing has no pulse, and the photography isn't all that interesting, but ""Benjamins"" at least moves. It's an action film without a brain, but the two charismatic stars to help it along, often tricking the viewer into enjoying this mess a lot more then should be allowed.What the people really have come to see is the reteaming of Cube and Epps. Fresh from their inspired work in ""Next Friday,"" the duo returns here in ""Benjamins"" with the same easy back and forth comic touch. Think of them as the urban Hope and Crosby. While Ice Cube is his typical stoic self, Epps takes the comedy baton and runs like hell with it. Epps is hilarious in ""Benjamins,"" making even the most painful aspects of the production seem like cherry pie with his alert comic timing and his gift for improvisation. This gift is so beloved by the filmmakers that they keep letting the camera roll on Epps as he does his free-flowing thing with the screenplay. Normally, a very destructive method to wring a laugh. But with Epps, it works.Cube and Epps make an impressive comic team, and they make the shamelessly hackneyed ""Benjamins"" a worthwhile sit for fans of the duo. Everyone else, save your benjamins and stay far away. ---------- 7/10",N/A

I am a cartoom-movie fan so I especially liked it because it was unusual and funny, but still a nice fairy tale and very well drawn and animated. The animation is actually absolutely brilliant, it really looks more like a movie than a cartoon!I think some kids can watch this movie and enjoy the fairy tale aspect, but on the other hand, I think that some kids around 7 and 8 won't get, as one reviewer objected, some of the jokes, which are actually not targeted for that age, but more for a late teen and adult audience. I would not say the jokes are downright dirty, some have a double meaning but they are not vulgar or offensive and I don't see the need to get offended. I would not buy it specifically for a kid, but it is a movie that the whole family can watch together.",Shrek VHS
553517,"I had seen this film a couple of times and never really warmed up to it, but I thought I'd give the DVD a try. After 3 viewings I think I finally got it. Sure, a lot of it is implausible and weird--but if you can willingly suspend your disbelief you are in for a rich noir ride. The writing is superb, the locations are exotic and evocative, and this baby is dark and cynical to its core! Rita Hayworth proves herself an excellent actress--to balance all of the flesh Welles so lovingly displays of his soon ex-to-be. Why Welles had to saddle himself with the accent is truly beyond me, and I felt it didn't work that well--although it didn't ruin the picture. All the supporting players are evil and sweaty, especially Everett Sloan as the crippled cuckold. I think that crippling is the central metaphor in the film, but more so emotional crippling. All of these people are just twisted and broken inside, and they can't even begin to understand love, loyalty, and compassion. Visually this is portrayed by the funhouse mirror scene, an obvious reference to their narcissism and inability to connect to others as they really are. Well, enough psychobabble. The DVD has some nice extras and we learn a lot about the history and making of the film. Bogdanovitch does a commentary that is rich in many ways, but has two central problems: it is not linked to what is happening on the screen, and it becomes very repetitive at a certain point. This is a gripe I have with a lot of commentary tracks--someone turns on a mic and the subject blabs on without really talking directly about the great stuff happening RIGHT NOW in the movie. The best tracks are very focused on the film, and they integrate all of their information into it. For some great tracks, I recommend Ebert's Citizen Kane, Camille Paglia on Basic Instinct, and the track for the Criterion Notorious. Anyway, Lady from Shanghai is a seminal noir that is visually and thematically satisfying. Give my love to the sunrise!",N/A

These way cool guys go on to rob, murder, mutilate a cop, and leave a companion to bleed for the entire movie.It's as if there is a contest between directors of this genre to see who can show the most depraved characters, or who can use the F-word the most time in 5 minutes of dialogue.Other than the slick clothes, Steve Buscemi's character is virtually interchangeable with the one in Fargo, except that this time he likes the DeFranco Family rather than Jose Feliciano.This movie is cliche and disgusting at the same time.",N/A

Fight Club came out during my freshman year in college, and i never planned on seeing it, untill a Girl that i know, told me i had to see it.  I figured it was because of Brad Pit that she enjoyed it so much.  I walked out of the theatre in what you could call a state of shock.  This movie took me places that I never thought possible.

378549,"For some reason, I find myself watching The Langoliers again every few months.  Almost inexplicably, it has become one of my favorite Stephen King miniseries.  The plot has a couple of holes big enough to consume the giant time rip that causes all the problems in the first place, and the actors overplay their characters almost to a man, but the concept of the ""langoliers"" themselves lends a fresh little twist to the sometimes hackneyed concept of time travel.David Morse outshines the rest of the cast in his role as Captain Engle, although Bronson Pinchot (in quite a breakout role for him at the time) is wonderful (albeit irritating) as the deranged Craig Toomey.  Pinchot really goes for all the stops in making his character as noticeable and loud as possible, and he begins to learn the secrets of making your face reflect madness toward the end.  The quirky Dean Stockwell is another overactor here; playing a mystery writer, he hems and haws, striking Rodin's Thinker-like poses all over the place, invigorating even his most trivial comments with a sense of dire importance.  Mark Lindsey Chapman is not bad, nor is Patricia Wettig.  Kate Maberly plays the young blind girl Dinah; this character has the distinction of being the most annoying character I have ever encountered.  I earnestly dislike her character, which makes my fondness for this movie so surprising to me.  I would be remiss if I failed to mention Stephen King's appearance; it is one of his best cameos ever, in my opinion.  He plays a bank president, but his appearance can only be described as cheesy, reminding me somewhat of the character he played in Creepshow.DVD technology actually detracts from this movie somewhat; the langoliers, when they finally arrive, look much cheesier than they originally appeared on television and VHS.  This does not really harm the story, though.  Despite its flaws, it is a story I find fascinating.  This movie is probably a little long for some people's taste, coming in at three hours; despite its length, character development actually leaves something to be desired.  Some of the dialogue is rather forced, as well.  Thus, I can easily see why some folks don't jump up and down praising The Langoliers, but somehow it manages to entertain and intrigue me every time I watch it.  It offers an unusual twist to the done-to-death subject of time travel, and I think that is what keeps me coming back.",Langoliers VHS
406770,"1955's ""The Blackboard Jungle"" remains a poignant, relevant portrayal of life in America's public schools.  The story of WWII vet turned English teacher (Glenn Ford)as he struggles to reach a class of apathetic teens who do not want to be reached, the movie takes us from Ford's unsuspecting classroom debut through his efforts to lead a normal home life despite the pressures of his new job and finally to a climactic showdown with his most evil of students.The movie's cast is thoroughly excellent.  Ford is at once tough and terribly vulnerable as the embattled new teacher, Margaret Hayes is all patrician slinkiness as For'd wanne-be paramour, Sidney Poitier is convincing as the slowly mellowing student, and Anne Francis is even sexier than she was in ""Forbidden Planet"" as Ford's supportive but insecure wife.There's much to appreciate in this film.  Partly intended to help comat the growing problem of juvenile delinquency in 50s America, the film tries hard to achieve realism and generally succeeds.  The students in Ford's class are disillusioned, lazy, suspicious, arrogant, obnoxious, and sometimes dangerous--which is exactly how teens are in real life.  The only typical teenage bad habit that's not portrayed (or at least suggested) is cursing, which of course 50s moral standards would not allow on the big screen.  But if they don't swear, Ford's students have no trouble finding other ways to be both annoying and anarchic, just like real kids.  Interestingly, Ford discovers (much like this reviewer did) that sometimes the best way to reach apathetic kids is with a cartoon.  Sad.Another great thing about this movie is its approach to the politics of the school world.  The movie's teachers argue and struggle not only with their students, but amongst themselves.  Moreover, the encroaching dangers of multiculturalism are, perhaps inadverdantly, accurately addressed as Ford must deal with ethnic divisions amongst his students which some are eager to exploit for their own gain, as when Ford is unfairly accused of racism simply because of some careless word choices.  In today's schools Political Correctness is indeed the rule, often to the detriment of real learning and growth, so at least one of the film's pertinent warnings has gone ignored.Though some might find ""The Blackboard Jungle"" dated, it is in fact as timely in all the important ways as it was in the 50s.  The American educational problem continues to undercut many of society's more noble aims, and it will do so as long as the powers that be refuse to take the necessary steps to reach a solution.  Teens must be taught there are absolutes in life and be expected to live up to them, not encouraged to simply indulge their every whim.  Perhaps if enough of us adults in liberated America come to realize this for ourselves, we can at least begin to convince our children of it.",Blackboard Jungle VHS
143752,"'Carrie' has always been my favourite Stephen King novel, i have read it numerous times. I was a little annoyed that Brian De Palma saw fit to deviate from the book as much as he did. But, back then when films were based on novels, the two always looked vastly different.In this movie, the main character is a girl named Carrie White. She is unpopular largely due to the fact that the whole town thinks she and her mother are freaks. In all truthfulness, her mother is deeply religious as well as psychotic. Carrie is in a constant struggle between the old world and the new world (ie. the need to please her mother for fear of enraging her, and the need for acceptance by her classmates). Carrie wants to live like her classmates, but the slightest sign of recalcitrance sees her locked in tiny closet to 'pray for forgiveness'.But what nobody knows is that Carrie is telekinetic, meaning she has the ability to move objects by simple thought.One day at school, Carrie gets her first period in the shower at school. Her classmates laugh at her and throw pads and tampons, not thinking that she has no idea of what's going on. When she is sent home early the school principal keeps getting her name wrong, proving just how unimportant she really is to others. One of the girls in the class Sue Snell (Amy Irving) feels badly about the prank and asks her boyfriend to take Carrie to the prom to make it up to her. But there is another girl, Chris Hargenson (Nancy Allen), who is hellbent on ruining Carrie. And the best chance to do that is at the senior prom, so she plots with her boyfriend (John Travolta) to humiliate Carrie in a bizarre, but very ugly way.This was a fair adaption, but I feel that there was a lot of excellent material that should have been used. Concepts such as the old world versus the new world, the struggle that all teenagers face of wanting to make their parents happy but wanting to be 'cool' to their classmates. The metaphor of blood, God versus Satan, and the destruction of the world (ie. Armageddon).Brian De Palma was also an Alfred Hitchcock alumni, he changed the name of the school from Ewen High School to Bates High School (as in Norman Bates).",N/A

William Hurt's performance is wooden; the guy playing Paul mistakes his literary counterpart's confident self-assurance with haughty arrogance; and Jessica is turned into a royal priss instead of the world weary intelligent woman she was in the novel.  The sets were terrible and generic. Showing the navigator was just dumb--Hitchcockian allusion is the way to go with the navigators.

309744,"&quot;You Only Live Twice&quot; is a James Bond techno-thriller in which Sean Connery, Nancy Sinatra's title song, and the spectacular rocket base set all take turns overwhelming the story.  The script for this 1967 film is based very loosely on Ian Fleming's 1964 novel, is more of a disappointment once you realize it was written by Roald Dahl.  A pair of satellites belonging to the U.S. and the U.S.S.R. are swallowed up by a mysterious spacecraft belonging to SPECTRE, the super-criminal organization run by Ernest Stavro Blofeld, played this time around by Donald Pleasance (and the first time we actually see Blofeld's face).  The idea is to provoke a superpower war so that SPECTRE can come in afterwards and pick up the pieces (presumably all wearing suits to protect them from the radiation).After &quot;Moonraker,&quot; this is the James Bond film that makes the most of science fiction hardware.  The secret rock base is located inside a Japanese volcano, which makes for a big battle sequences between SPECTRE's troops and Japanese ninja secret agents (or would that be secret agent ninjas?).  In retrospect, this scene is one of the most important in the Bond series because it upped the ante for all future films.  There would still be all the fun gadgets and gizmos, but giant set pieces like this one would becomes required elements from here on out.  In fact, Bond movies now usually begin with such set pieces and not just end with them.&quot;You Only Live Twice&quot; is a mixed bag.  John Barry's score is his best for the entire Bond series, which says something right there, and the title song gets my vote for being the best of the Bonds as well.  Plus you have Sean Connery as James Bond (even if he thinks he is turning Japanese).  But there are some substantial parts of the film where nothing really happens, and even the beautiful Japanese scenery cannot detract from how badly things start to drag.  However, I appreciate the fact that Mie Hama as Kissy, breaks the Bond girl mold.  For that matter, this film gives Japanese actors a chance to play something other than brutal World War II soldiers or prison guards, which is certainly of some cinematic importance.",N/A

But of course, looks alone do not make a film. It must have some substance. Perhaps having read the book and rather enjoying it, I have a biased opinion but this film didn't seem to have much to do with the book except share a title, main idea and some character names. Sara Schiff should be ashamed for butchering the tale. Trying to modernize the story may have seemed like a good idea, but it wasn't, it really wasn't. Since the boys are no longer British and no longer living during the WWII era (one mentions 'Alf', seriously folks) and since they are American children who have grown up on video games and now curse like sailors, it is easier to believe that they would revert to savagery. The screenplay has also conviently added an adult on the island and also completely removed the entire scene with Simon and the Lord of the Flies. The young actors cannot be accused of bad acting since almost none of the characters are developed enough to really act. Ralph was watered down, Piggy reminded me of a young Drew Carey. The only characters I had strong feelings for were Jack (hated him) and Simon (loved him). It's just kind of a shame. My advice to you is read the book definately, don't even think about renting it without having read it. If you're interested though, by all means rent it. It's not a horrible film in general, it's just a bad adaptation.",N/A

In this movie, Woody Allen films the entire movie in black and white and gives you these romantic shots.  It is not that the story is about romance, but he is showing you the romance of the everyday in New York.  This is a beautiful view.Allen's character is in a muddle.  His is ex-wife is now a lesbian who is writing a tell-all book about him.  His girlfriend is under-aged and leaving for Europe.  His best friend is having an affair and Allen falls in love with her.  This is classic Woody Allen.  You find yourself caught up in all the situations and questions of the modern world and continually find yourself focusing on the problems.Why do we complain about all this?  Because it helps to keep us from being overwhelmed with the world.  All we need do is focus on the beautiful things.  Here, focus on ""Manhattan"" and Manhattan, and enjoy life.

674497,"Genevieve Bujold as Antigone is splendid; Fritz Weaver as Creon, even better.  Anouilh's version of Antigone is longer than Sophocles', allocating far more time to the confrontation between the heroine and the king.  Bujold has fine moments in this scene, but Weaver's acting skill and stage presence are completely, masterfully at home.  What a shame that most of his video work has been with scripts which, compared with this, were poor stuff!Before the struggle with Creon, there is a love scene between Antigone and her fiance, Haemon.  James Naughton's handsome, well dressed, thoroughly decent, college-boy Haemon, is the sturdy male partner, with and around whom Bujold dances in words and movement.  Beautifully and affectingly.  Stacy Keach as Chorus, Aline Macmahon as the nurse, Louis Zorich as Jonas (the first guard) and Peter Brandon as the messenger suit the performance well and contribute to its excellence.Jean Anouilh wrote in French.  The translation used in this performance is Lewis Galantiere's ""adaptation.""  It was used for the American premiere, New York City 1946, starring Katherine Cornell as Antigone and Cedric Hardwicke as Creon.  Galantiere writes beautifully, but so does Anouilh, whom it's a shame to adapt when you can stay true to the original.  Often, this production seems to agree, restoring some of the adapter's cuts and deleting various additions and emendations.Galantiere's understanding of the heroine's motives differs from Anouilh's in important respects.  At the beginning of the play, Galantiere has Chorus, when introducing Antigone, assert that she is ""on the side of the gods against the tyrant, of Man against the State.""  That may be how many people, vaguely remembering Sophocles, think of the character.  But the take is Galantiere's, not corresponding to anything in the speech at hand, and not consistent with the development of the play.Anouilh's Antigone does not invoke the gods, the common people, mankind or humanity, or define what she opposes as tyranny or the state.  Early in their confrontation, Creon asks Antigone why she tried to bury her brother, Polynices.  She replies that she ""owed it to him. . .  Those who are not buried wander eternally and find no rest.""  She feels sure that what she did was right, but does not elaborate.  One can tell little concerning her notions of an afterlife, and nothing concerning her belief in any gods.Creon asks whether she really believes that the dead wander as shades if not properly buried, and reminds her that burial ceremonies are often wretchedly performed by the priests, an insult to the dead and their mourners.  Then, in a passage omitted by Galantiere but restored in this production, Creon says: ""And you still insist on being put to death, merely because I refuse to let your brother go out with that grotesque passport, which you would have been the first to be embarrassed by if I'd allowed it.  The whole thing is absurd.""  She replies, ""Yes, it's absurd.""  Then, for whom did she disobey the law?  ""For nobody,"" she replies.  ""For myself.  For me.""Antigone had not seen Polynices, since he left home eight years ago, when she was only 12.  Much of that time, Creon (honestly?) informs her, Polynices and her other brother, Eteocles, had spent plotting and attempting the assassination of her father, Oedipus.  She is staggered by these charges, but finds a stance, in opposition to the kind of life that Creon exemplifies.  To obtain happiness he must continually compromise, doing what he despises, saying Yes to what he hates.  On the contrary, she insists, it is better to say No to what you would rather not do, even if you must die for it.This is her position at the end of the confrontation with Creon.  In the last scene, as Jonas takes her to the tomb where she is to be buried alive, she dictates a letter to Haemon: ""My darling, I wanted to die, and maybe you won't love me any more.  Creon was right.  It is terrible to die.  And I don't even know what I'm dying for.""  The last three sentences were omitted by Galantiere, but restored in this production.  To make sure that they register with the audience, they occur twice, dictated by Antigone and repeated by Jonas.Was Galantiere's version commissioned by the Broadway producers?  Was he asked to soften the radical, existential despair in Anouilh's play?On another issue, the Chorus says some fascinating things about tragedy, which seem partly contradicted by the play.  His ruminations occur shortly before the confrontation between Antigone and Creon.  For example: ""Tragedy is restful; and the reason is that hope, that foul, deceitful thing, has no part in it.  There isn't any hope.  You're trapped. ...  In melodrama, you argue and struggle in the hope of escape.""  But in tragedy, you ""shout"" to express what you are.The point does fit Antigone's behavior.  She has no hope of escaping death and does not try.  But Creon argues and struggles with Antigone, hoping to change the outcome.  So does Ismene. Haemon argues and struggles with his father.  Even the Chorus gets into the argument, with suggestions to Creon on how to prevent the catastrophe.  Should we treat the Chorus' aphorisms as evidence that sometimes he (or the playwright?) doesn't know what he's talking about?Should the audience respond to tragedy as if there were no hope?  Thanks to their myths, the Greek audience knew how Antigone was going to end.  Thanks to Sophocles, so do we.  But while experiencing the play I seem to suspend this knowledge, hoping against hope that a decent way out exists, even if the characters don't quite manage to see or take it.

This review is associated with the DVD released in 2002 - which is available on Amazon. The review references this edition of the movie: http://www.amazon.com/Casino-Royale-David-Niven/dp/B00005JL0I/ref=cm_rdp_productFinally this comedic take on the James Bond series makes its way onto DVD, and for completists and fans of James Bond this 2002 DVD promises not only the 1967 version of Ian Flemings first 007 novel but also an edited down version of the very first James Bond movie, the 1950s CBS TV movie that starred Barry Nelson as James Bond (thats right, Sean Connery was NOT the first actor to portray 007). Made for an American audience, the character of James Bond is a CIA agent in that show and Leiter is the British intelligence agent. That movie, which is listed as a special feature on this DVD, also starred Peter Lorre as the villain Le Chiffre. Made in the days of live television this entertaining oddity is worth watching for the bloopers alone.Years later, the rights to ""Casino Royale"" made it into the hands of another movie producer who, convinced that any attempt to make a serious version of ""Casino Royale"" would be doomed without the talents of Sean Connery, decided to make the remake as a comedy instead. With Peter Sellers playing James Bond and Orson Welles taking on the role of Le Chiffre everything seemed to be going fine until a script dispute caused Sellers to walk out on the project. Left with half a movie the producers were in trouble and they scrambled to save their production. One needs to understand this background to the movie to understand why it turned out the way it did. In it's final version it seems truly confused with several actors portraying the role of James Bond and several directors (including John Huston who also cameos as M) taking a crack at it. There is even an early appearance by Woody Allen and former Bond girl Ursula Andress. For me personally, the Peter Sellers scenes are especially brilliant and very funny and David Niven plays the perfect gentleman spy. The action comes thick and fast and in addition to Andress there are a number of actors familiar to devotees to the rival EON productions. This movie is truly",Casino Royale

345551,"What a beautiful film. I am totally in love with Louise Brooks - she is a doll. This film is her ""Sergeant Pepper"" as it showcases her at the peak of her creative career in every way.Why there is no DVD release of this mega-classic film is a sin! If any silent film deserves the ""Criterion treatment"", this is the one! Until its release, we must depend on VHS versions of the film such as this one. The film is presented un-tinted, in true black and white, with a piano score that is quite suitable to the ""feel"" of the time period.For me, this movie works best as a short-hand overview of the roaring twenties and their demise. In the first act of the picture, gorgeous young Lulu (played brilliantly by Brooks, who looks and acts so incredibly ""modern"" throughout), is having a real ball being the girl about town. But after her husband's death, she tragically predicts the market crash of 1929 almost prohetically, by her poverty in England and her untimely demise at the end of the film.My favorite scene is where she is caught frolicking backstage with another woman's fiance. Brooks, with hair disheveled, has that ""I've been [messing]-around with your man, but so what"" deliciously guilty expression on her beautiful face. Brooks plays it like a woman who's been there/done that, and looks absolutely sexy in the act.Louise Brooks earns my vote as the sexiest actress of all-time; and this, her landmark role proves it!",N/A
525574,"Casting: A+Set Design: ASpecial Effects: BStory Adaptation: C+My problem with this movie is that it's far too rigidly literal to the books, and hence it suffers as a film (even though the book is wonderful). It's well-documented that Miss Rowling had a very strong presence during the making of the movie, and I do think that Chris Columbus, a competent director, let himself be intimidated and stifled by it. There's virtually no trace of his creative hand that's visible in the film. I could practically hear the pages of the book being read verbatim. &quot;And then they went here, and then they did this, and then this happens...&quot;On the good side, the actors are really excellent and everything looks exactly right. The special effects were not up to par on a film costing this much money. It's actually a pretty good movie, I just wish the filmmakers had taken a few liberties in order to make it better.

381468,"Although not really made clear in the movie, this great epic takes place from the pre- 1917 revolution period, to the late 1930's, and post-war in the final scene . The best scenes, and most of the film, actually take place during the Russian Civil War of the early 1920's, a period most Westerners, mainly Americans, may not be familiar with. After the Revolution, the Reds and Whites battled it out some more in some of the bloodiest battles of the century. It is historically accurate with the Reds riding around in their armored trains, machine guns at the ready, producing such horrors as the massacre of the boys dressed in white in the snow. The love stories all the way through, and Zhivago's exile are true, based on the autobiographical novel, and the winter scenes are fabulous and mesmorizing. Even though it gets a little dragged down in the soap opera aspect, this is without doubt a great historical epic, the specialty of David Lean, among the great British directors. In fact you don't even notice the obvious fact that English is spoken all the way thru in this totally Russia-based  masterpiece. Even the dam, as shown in the end, represents the Soviet industrial might, as it did from the 1930's-50's. The story is summarized nicely by Amazon,but the historical context does not seem to be given its due, so perhaps this review will assist in that aspect of this magnificent classic!!",Doctor Zhivago VHS

209372,"OK, as a sequel, this movie just cannot possibly compare to the original Grease, which is on par with The Wizard of Oz. The casting director got two bad actors who very VAGUELY physically resemble Danny Zuko and Kinickie. And the screenwriters decided to make the T-Birds a bunch of scared cowards who run (a la Oscar de la Hoya) at the mere mention of Crator-Face. But the movie is fun, even though the songs pretty much stink. The songs in the original, every one, turned out to be an unforgettable classic. In G2 they are all very forgettable. Michael Carrington, the Aussie cousin of Sandy's is the best thing in the movie, and he and a very young Michelle Pffeifer pretty much salvage the movie. The theme this time is motorcycles instead of hot rods, and that is a good twist, as is the &quot;Cool rider&quot; gimmick, but not enough. The T-Birds actually are very uncool in this movie, as they spend the entire flick trying really hard to act cool, and look like idiots in every single scene. John Travolta, in his first &quot;T-Bird&quot; scene in Grease, is just hanging out talking to some girls, and he oozes coolness with just a glance. The character Johnny spends the entire Grease 2 movie trying to be tough and cool, and runs and hides behind the Pink Ladies when Crator-face calls him out.?

Before winding up in the village, she, and other captive women and children, were forced to march from town to town by the Japanese, who did not know what to do with them.  They meet Joe Harmon, an Australian soldier, who steals food for them, and is crucified by the Japanese and left for dead.While in Malaya, she learns that Harmon survived, and goes to Australia to find him.

7169,"""Remains of the Day"" is a classic film from the Merchant-Ivory team that lifted the English drama genre out of BBC and PBS obscurity. It works seemlessly and beautifully between past and present, and shows the depth of human emotion behind upper-crust gentility.Anthony Hopkins is superb as Stevens, the head butler to an English lord whose naive sympathy for the Nazis lead to his downfall. Emma Thompson plays the head housekeeper who joins the manor staff and tries to shake Hopkins out of his emotional and political complacency. The attraction between the two grows out of the tension between doing one's duty and honoring one's feelings. As Thompson's character grows more restless, Hopkins' grows ever more resistant to her overtures. One excellent scene, where she invades his dark study, shows how the butler's training and detachment struggle against a growing affection: as Thompson tries to pry a book from Hopkins' fingers, you can hear the clench he maintains until the end.The film covers a lot of themes at once: loyalty, sacrifice, unrequited love, and regret. When Hopkins travels to search out Thompson nearly twenty years after WWII, it's as much for the chance at reviving love as it is for asking her to return to the manor. The end scenes are heart-rending without being maudlin.The other characters are also well done: James Fox as Lord Darlington, the old-fashioned aristocrat who plays the unwitting dupe for Nazi envoys in pre-Churchill Britain; Christopher Reeve as the realistic American politician who voices fear and dismay at the events in the manor (and becomes owner after the war); Peter Vaughan as Stevens' elderly father, and Hugh Grant as Darlington's nephew.Location shots are sumptuous, from the grand interiors of Darlington Hall to the English countryside.

We see her and her gang face vampires and all sorts of other unpleasant creatures and demons (and most of the episodes deal with non - vampire creatures...). But we also get to see other aspects of teenage life: Buffy's struggles with being unpopular and being teased by thepopular crowd, especially Cordelia, after being popular herself in her old school.

There are a few, and they're interesting (Joss Wheadon's commentary, a few explanations by him on a few episodes), but there are so few of them! The commentary, for instance, is only for the first 2 episodes, but a commentary on the last episode would have been great too.

242279,"The most striking element that will ""hook"" you into watching this Bret Easton Ellis novel adaption of the same name, is the captivating visual beauty of the sets and cinematography. There are also two fine performances from two great actors.Robert Downey Jr. gives a highly realistic performance as Julian, a hopeless junkie spiraling rapidly into oblivion before the eyes of his best friend Clay, played by Andrew McCarthy, and his on again, off again borderline coke-head gal-pal model, Blair(Jami Gertz). After Clay returns home from school, he's found that Julian has bedded his girl, and that being away has changed where he fits into this new drug addled scene. Despite this glaring breach of friendships, Clay plays the good egg who tries to keep both parties from self destruction.The perpetually bug-eyed McCarthy seems strangely detached and unemotional in his role, while Jami Gertz, whom I usually find interesting, seems one dimensional and stiff.  The award here goes to the talented Robert Downey Jr. as Julian.  In this film he puts out a sincerely gut-wrenching performance. I once read that he said he WASN't acting, and that WAS how he is in real life.  Is the fact or the fiction stranger?  You must watch this and find out.My favorite actor in general, as well as in this movie, is the great James Spader. I've seen just about everything he's ever been in, and he is no disappointment here. He turns in a fabulous performance as Trent, a ruthless drug dealer who has Julian under his thumb. When Julian gets in over his head and can't pay for his increasing habit, Trent is appropriately loathesome and cruel as he pimps Julian to earn his keep. The degradation he is put through escalates as Blair and Clay try to save him. James Spader and Robert Downey Jr. also worked beautifully together in the wonderful teen love story ""Tuff Turf"" in 1985. (See my review for more).The other important reason to view this film, is that it's truly beautiful in the visual aspect. We see California wealth illustrated in moving pictures of bright technicolor.  Vividly  sparkling blue swimming pools,  elegant mansions with colorful manicured gardens and sprawling lawns too. Everyone looks like a fashion model who just stepped out of a glossy magazine. The parties are replete with debauched debutantes in crystal mirrored bathrooms holding their coke-bloody noses.  Watching this film is a guilty pleasure we must all experience vicariously.Although it can be somewhat depressing at times, especially toward the end, I STILL enjoy it. The film also features a killer soundtrack that captures the era perfectly. These elements serve to elevate a minimally flawed script, and make this a visually arresting piece of gorgeous celluloid eye candy that needs to seen and sampled, even if you don't always like the taste of the rest.",Less Than Zero VHS
526004,"One of the things I love best about Robert Redford's movies is the singular visual quality he employs in each, and the way he uses the environment to add to the telling of the tale. Whether it be in the breath-taking ""A River Runs Through It"", in which the stunning Montana countryside is a virtual unattributed co-star in the film, or ""The Horse Whisperer"", in which every rugged natural element about the pristine rural surroundings add to the tale, he always uses his topography, climate, and setting to charm the audience into the frame of reference he is using to spin his yarn. This is no less so here, where he uses the gorgeous background of the rural countryside in telling this tale of a man coming to terms with his potential.This is a classic tale of a professional golfer with almost unlimited potential who is content to let it all ride because he is basically afraid of success. And with Matt Damon, he finds a believable and sympathetic protagonist who decides to take the chance and make the effort based on the mysterious appearance and subsequent profound influence of Bagger Vance, an almost angelic figure who we are finally left to wonder about. Will Smith steps out of his usual cocky roles to give a thoughtful and whimsical performance, and add immeasurably to the film.Smith acts as a fulcrum throughout the movie, showing us the wisdom of homespun realism as opposed to city wisdom, of simple virtues as opposed to more sophisticated aims and pursuits, and of honesty and craftsmanship over gamesmanship and conniving.This movie is very much in line with his previous efforts in ""the Natural', another whimsical tale about a man coming to term with his talents and his demons, learning to finally accept both as coming from him at the same time he resolves his existential situation. This is the case here, too, and one walks away from the film feeling good about the world. And watching Charlize Theron support her man is enough to make anyone cheer.This is beautifully filmed period piece, and all of the production values from costumes to dialogue to settings to historical accuracy are impeccable drawn together in service to the plot and resolution. The golf sequences are extremely well done, and there is hardly a golf fan in the world who wouldn't like the film just on that basis alone. For those of us who are fans of Redford's work, this is another in a series of thoughtful efforts to paint us a picture of an alternative side to this busy and frantic world we might otherwise never see.

208988,"""The Wrath of Khan"" is definitely one of the best of the series.  It has everything going for it: A first-rate plot with exciting space battles (the final confrontation in the Mutara Nebula is very suspenseful).  Great acting & character development.  Fantastic special effects.  A superb soundtrack by James Horner, one of the greatest film composers of all time.  It folds out as no less than a science-fiction triumph.""The Director's Edition"" DVD is one of the best DVD's I own.  Like the Director's Edition of ""The Motion Picture"", (but with far superior picture quality) it sprouts new transfer and sound.  And it also has about five minutes worth of new/expanded scenes.  The interviews with the cast and production crew are interesting and very funny.  The other documentaries are also very worthwhile.HIGHEST POSSIBLE RECOMMENDATION!!!

519477,"From the very opening shot, as a blindfolded Al Pacino is raced through the streets of Gaza to meet the leader of the Hezbollah to negotiate an interview with 60 minutes, you know that style is going to be important component of this movie. Before that, even, if you're paying attention, since it's a Michael Man flick (he of Miami Vice and Manhunter).And like Manhunter, style gets the better of content, to the point where the content jackknifes halfway though and the film morphs from a fairly routine Whistleblower expose (like Silkwood) to a Testament to Journalistic Integrity: Russell Crowe's victimised whistleblowing ciggy scientist almost completely disappears from the last forty minutes as Pacino battles with CBS legal and corporate honchos to get the segment aired in the name of truth and justice.Meantime, the style grates - from the elaborate opener in Palestine which, while impressive, is irrelevant to the film except to show off Al's commitment to his profession, to the silly music and the the endless shots of the backs of heads - especially Crowe's, but towards the end of the film, everyone else's as well. Maybe Mann was trying to invoke some imagery with this, but I couldn't figure it out, so it just annoyed me, especially since it highlighted, in Crowe's case, a very poor wig.Crowe did his best to rustle (ha!) up a Kentucky accent, but still was miscast - I don't think the Wigand character was a hollywood hunk. Pacino carried the film and Christopher Plummer's portrayal of Mike Wallace was spot on.While it's undoubtedly an entertaining film, just too much about it was cliched or needlessly modish for it to make a real impression, so I reckon it's destined for the half price hire section in the video store.But cheap at half the price.Olly Buxton",N/A

97321,"Christopher Guest is probably best known for being the alter ego of Nigel Tufnel, lead guitarist of Spinal Tap in the film This is Spinal Tap.  What people often miss out on are his multiple talents. For example, in This is Spinal Tap, Guest not only gave a wonderfully silly, yet nuanced performance as the band's vapid guitar player, but he also co-wrote (with Rob Reiner, Michael McKean and Harry Shearer) the screenplay and co-wrote (also with Reiner, McKean, and Shearer) all of the band's songs on the soundtrack. This sort of ""renaissance man"" behavior would lead anyone to expect great things on the horizon from Guest.And almost fifteen years later, it happened.Waiting for Guffman is the story of the residents of Blaine, Missouri, celebrating its sesquicentennial (150th anniversary). With the help of Corky St. Clair (Guest), a Broadway veteran, they are going to put on a musical called Red, White, and Blaine. During rehearsals, Corky gets a letter stating that casting director Mort Guffman is coming to town to see the show. The cast gets really excited and puts on the show of their lives....With a man who appears to be Mort Guffman sitting in the front row...Guffman is really the story behind the play, however. A story that anyone who has ever done community theatre will identify with. Particularly anyone who has ever done really bad community theatre.But along with being a stunning satire on local theatre troupes, Waiting for Guffman is also almost totally improvised. Apart from the songs, which were written before, the actors were only given direction (by writers Christopher Guest and Eugene Levy) as to what should happen in a given scene, then were given free reign to improvise their own dialogue. This is what brings Waiting for Guffman to Recommendation level.That and the fact that it's the funniest movie I've ever seen.Fred Willard and Catherine O'Hara co-star and Blaine's semi-famous acting couple. Eugene Levy plays Dr. Allan Pearl, a dentist with a Johnny Carson fixation who has just discovered the show biz bug. Parker Posey is just adorable as Libby Mae, former Dairy Queen clerk getting a taste for the big time. The cast is perfect and this movie would not have been the same without them.All in all, Waiting for Guffman is a stunning parody of community theatre, complete with Broadway-style songs about Blaine, stools, and UFO's written by Spinal Tap veterans Guest, Michael McKean, and Harry Shearer.[Guest and company attempted to repeat the formula with Best in Show (which I found lacking), but this is such an original that it stands high above its successor.]",N/A

Unfortunately, there's very little in this film to commend it to viewers. The book has been gutted to fit it into a neat, 90-minute package, though the changes in plot flow fairly well. The biggest problem is that Left Behind never generates much excitement or interest. You never really care about the characters, and what they're doing on-screen is never all that interesting. The four leads are coming to grips with their physical and spiritual fates, while preparing to do battle with the ultimate evil -- but the tone doesn't appear vastly different from our own daily lives.

In actuality, there really isn't as much as you might think.

289179,"Gregory Peck stars as David Stillwell, a man with a secret.  The problem is: He doesn't know he has a secret, because he is suffering from amnesia.  Thus begins this psychological thriller in the Hitchcock tradition, set in New York City in the mid 1960s.Peck, feeling that he's lost his grip on reality, and needing to actualize his existence, starts down the path of reconstructing his life.  Because he has amnesia, he can't remember having any friends.  He visits a psychiatrist (played with passion and intelligence by Robert Harris) and hires an easy-going private eye (Walter Matthau) to investigate who he really is, and find out his identity.  Early on, he runs into old flame, Sheila, played by the beautiful and underrated Diane Baker (fresh off of Hitchcock's dark ""Marnie"").  She turns out to be even more of a cipher than Peck, refusing clues to his queries about his identity.  ""I want to remember who I am!"" Peck rages at Baker.  Her tortured reply singularly sums up his bizarre and paradoxical world: ""Not remembering is the only thing keeping you alive!""So, as you can see, this is a neat twist on the amnesia flick, and I'm going to stop here, because I don't want to give any more of the plot of ""Mirage"" away.  The intelligent script by Peter Stone (Charade) moves alternately fast-and-furious/ slow-and-langorous. ""Mirage"" is chock full of great performances:  George Kennedy and Jack Weston give two of the best portrayals of sociopathic, ruthless hired killers ever; Leif Erickson stars as ""The Major,"" an equally ruthless industrialist bent on prying the secret loose from Peck's clouded mind; Kevin McCarthy is glib and smarmy as the sycophantic Josephson and Walter Abel is suave and conflicted as Peck's mentor, Charles Calvin.Director Edward Dmytryk -- best known for his masterwork ""The Caine Mutiny,"" and blacklisted during the McCarthy years -- directed ""Mirage"" really tight: There are no dissolves; every cut is literally a cut, and the breakneck pace of the chase scenes further establishes Peck as a man alone, being kept on a long leash.  Dmytryk broke with tradition by editing even the flashback scenes with straight cuts, and it works beautifully.Notching the tension up even further is Quincy Jones' jazzy and urbane soundtrack, which draws on the ""crime jazz"" genre created by Elmer Bernstein and Henry Mancini and looks forward to Jones' own soundtrack for ""In the Heat of the Night.""That ""Mirage"" isn't even currently in any release is perplexing.  This is a totally solid and taut thriller,...it's worth every penny, especially if you're a Gregory Peck fan -- one of his best and most convincing performances.",Mirage VHS
456830,"This is Werner Herzog's 1979 superior remake of silent classic German Expressionist vampire film F. W. Murnau's Nosferatu: Symphony of Horror. This film is all that the 1922 silent version was, and more. It begins showing Dr. Renfield giving Jonathan the order to travel to the ""haunted"" land beyond the Forrest, Translvania, to give Count Dracula the papers for his new home. Lucy, Jonathan's wife begs him not to go, but he does not listen. Upon arriving to Dracula's castle, Dracula sees Lucy's picture and immediately signs the papers, and travels by ship to her town. Jonathan quickly rides back, but slowly gets sicker and sicker, until he cannot even remember how he met Lucy. Dracula's arrival brings the plague, and Lucy must make the ultimate sacrifice to destroy this hideous monster deprived of love.The film is beautifully shot, and acted, with Werner Herzog behind the camera capturing, Klaus Kinkski's terrifying portrayal of the evil Dracula killing his victims. So many memorable scenes of darkness and horror are scattered throughout this film, with the silent beauty of nature watching on the side. The music in this film adds to the atmosphere of the good side of Jonthan/Lucy, and to the evil side of Dracula.  The original 1922 version of this film, was perfect in its display of gothic horror, and this film has all that the original offered, but adds more philosophy and insight, and a tragic ending that makes this version superior. Another classic from Herzog and Kinkski, I highly recommend this film to all fans of horror, vampires, and classic films. 5 stars.",N/A

This is the second filming of Dashiell Hammett's classic detective story THE MALTESE FALCON which was filmed priorly in 1931 with Ricardo Cortez and Bebe Daniels. It was a good adaptation, but certainly not up to par with the 1941 classic with Humphrey Bogart, Mary Astor, Peter Lorre and Sidney Greenstreet.  This middle version is the bad apple of the bunch which is played largely for laughs: it concerns a ram's horn filled with valuable jewels. As an interesting footnote, Davis had just finished her role in the critically approved THE PETRIFIED FOREST when Jack Warner thrust this ill-scripted mess at her.  Davis was adamant that the part was an inconsequential one and that she needed a rest.  Warner had a doctor examine her, and Davis was forced to relent as she couldn't afford to take a suspension due to piling bills and increasing debt.

369510,"I ultimately object to NBK's theme, but it's a good movie in a general sense: well done and fun to watch.Mickey and Mallory, although they're murderers, have more life in them than anyone else in the movie. They are given superhuman strength and vitality (or, perhaps, merely human, contrasted with a subhuman society) as characterization---it's their will, their love and defiance that are strong; these manifest themselves physically in an age that worships violence. Compare Mickey with George Bernard Shaw's Don Juan: ""[He] follows his own instincts, without regard to the common, statute, or canon law; and therefore, whilst gaining the ardent sympathy of our rebellious instincts (which are flattered by the brilliances with which [he] associates them), finds himself in mortal conflict with existing institutions, and defends himself by force as unscrupulously as a farmer defends his crops against vermin.""And the institutions here are like vermin. Tommy Lee Jones' cop is genuinely sadistic, Robert Downey Jr.'s reporter is genuinely amoral, and ""Officer Scagnetti"" is genuinely depraved, sick, and psychotic. The authorities are old, tired, practically impotent: they don't dare attack M & M till they've stun-gunned and maced them. To the extent that NBK exposes the moral hypocrisy of modern society, I dig it. This movie tears the mask off of our appetite for murder news and it assigns sadistic law enforcers to a lower rung in hell than criminals. The fact that we needed such a wake-up call is more frightening than the film's violence.Of this violence much has been said; to me, it was cartoony and not usually disturbing. Only one of the movie's three really horrifying moments is violent: when Jones, jumping at the opportunity for cruelty, clamps a convict's nose with pliers. The other two scenes I mean are these: When Downey Jr. decides he's a natural born killer, dumps his wife and calls his mistress; and when Scagnetti, alone in the cell with Mallory, gets so delirious with erotic excitement that it's sickening to watch.M & M are the only moral people in the film---except the Indian. The Indian alone avoids being a sheep or parasite without becoming a murderer. But he has no motive except detached resignation to fate. Mickey repeatedly invokes fate, too; but he's fate's agent, not its patient.  This brings me to my objection to Oliver Stone's movie.The killers are born killers; the weak are (presumably) born weak. The cop & the anchorman who try to become killers cannot do so, even when they kill: they remain weak; they can't change their fate. Yet they are the ones in authority, with law and ""morality"" on their side. It seems Oliver Stone is spinning the old yarn about laws and moral codes being merely devices whereby the weak chain the strong. (Note the scene where the prison is opened.) Stone joins his villians in secretly worshipping Mickey and Mallory: it's a tradition as old as sophistry. Our age doesn't need Stone---it needs Socrates.",N/A
549696,"The performances of this film are excellent.  Ed Harris hits such diverse levels as the Catholic priest questioning his faith.  Anne Heche has nice orange hair, deep blue eyes, and looks marvelous.  The cinematography is excellent with the darker interior scenes and the flashbacks with their blue tones.  The DVD does not offer a lot of extra materials unless you'd like to have language subtitles.Two things about this picture bothered me.  The first is the attack on the Catholic church.  One person commented that this is the church that ""exonerates pedofiles and questions miracles.""  However, I think one must distinguish between the group religion and real religion which is personal and lives within the individual believer.  Harris does a masterful job of showing this conflict.  But it is the group attack that turned me off.  The film's point of view seems to assume that the group should work with the speed of the individual.  The velocities are quite different; so I found this an unaffair attack upon an easy target.The second problem I had was that the film didn't seem to go anywhere.  For me, the film fizzles at the end.  We go for a long time on the story then hit the ""1 year later"" cut and finally the ""3 years later"" cut.  This seemed to mute the ending rather than build to one.  This was not an episodic tale; so a climax would have been nice.  Of all the Amazon reviewers, I guess I'm the only one who wondered if that was the priest's baby that Heche brings in the last scene.  It would have been more interesting if she'd said something like, ""She has your eyes.""Although this film doesn't quite work, it's still interesting enough to spend some time with.  Pictures dealing with faith are few and far between & to be cherished when they do come along.",N/A

394598,"Cutthroat Island is not a great movie by any means.  But it is a lot of fun if you enjoy pirate treasure, sea battles, sword fighting, a great soundtrack, and wonderful period costumes.  The script is pretty weak and much of the acting is wooden.  Worse yet, it seems that no one learned anything from Errol Flynn's The Sea Hawk because they once again include a rather annoying monkey as comedy relief.  But what they do right is what makes this movie worth watching.  The film wonderfully recreates the 17th century Caribbean world of the pirates and is probably the most realistic looking realization of this time and place to date.  The actual portrayal of the pirates themselves owes more to &quot;Treasure Island&quot; and &quot;Peter Pan&quot; than &quot;The American Sea Rovers&quot;, but there is definately something compelling in the romantic myth of the golden age of piracy.  The pirate movie has suffered in recent years and Cutthroat will probably do nothing to revive it, which is really a shame as they, like the western and sci-fi adventure, are the best incarnations of modern myth to be found today.The story revolves around the quest of Captain Morgan Adams, the sexy yet honorable pirate queen, to avenge her father's murder and outwit her evil pirate nemesis and fratricidal uncle, Captain &quot;Dawg&quot; (who makes these names up?).  Taking command of her late father's ship and now in possession of part of a map to locate her father's lost treasure, Morgan sets out to win the vast riches for her and her hardy crew.  On the way she engages the services of the roguish &quot;Doctor&quot; Shaw, manages to obtain the remaining pieces of the map, then goes on to brave mutinies, betrayals, storms at sea, exploding cannonballs, bad dialogue, and cliched bad guys in a worthwhle romp through an era gone by, when men and women sailed tall wooden ships,  killed many people for profit, and drank themselves into oblivion on the high seas.I gave Cutthroat Island one more star than it probably really deserves simply for being a really guilty pleasure.  So grab your bottle of rum and cold steel cutlass and check it out!",N/A

569517,"This is one beauty of a head-scratcher. It is, literally, 3 movies in one. Al Adamson made the tight-yet-pointless heist film ECHO OF TERROR (a/k/a TWO TICKETS TO TERROR) in 1964, only to see it chopped up and intermixed with new footage several years later (starring John Carradine as an ethical but mad scientist) and retitled MAN WITH THE SYNTHETIC BRAIN, and sold as a horror cheapie to television. Not to be outdone, he and producer Sam Sherman further complicated matters by adding a third plot strand to the mix (something to do with killer zombies and yet another mad scientist, not to mention a rather sickly looking Tommy Kirk), and another new title, BLOOD OF GHASTLY HORROR. In order for the final incarnation to make sense, there are flashbacks-within-flashbacks all over the place.  There was yet another version, PSYCHO-A-G-GO, which had musical numbers spliced amongst the madness!Amazingly, it's quite an enjoyable viewing experience following the severely warped logic of the narrative, which only gets more confusing with each viewing.Topping it off is some of the best commentary I've yet heard on any dvd, provided by Sam Sherman, who promises to some day restore the integrity of Adamson's ECHO OF TERROR to its original glory (well, one can hope).As with Ed Wood, it's hard not to admire director Al Adamson's earnestness, and Vilmos Szigmond's cinematography (on the ECHO OF TERROR portions), despite the faded print used for the dvd, shows a precocious eye for composition.

600759,"After scanning some reviews I've decided to add my 2 cents, since I just got the DVD & saw the movie for the first time.  To those who say it has very similar elements already visited in films such as ""Crimson Tide,"" ""U-571"", etc., my reaction to that is, yes, you're right.  The first half hour of this movie I was a bit concerned about where it was going.  It had the ""been here, done that"" feel to it in regards to other ""sub movies."" I didn't buy Ford's accent at first (why? Because I know him from other movies, whereas if some unknown actor played the role, I wouldn't have questioned the authenticity or even the accent delivery at all), but as time passed, I didn't notice it as much and thought it was fine.  In regards to the why do Americans put accents on in the first place when speaking English, it's really no big mystery, it simply adds to the setting.  I suppose if you went the other extreme and gave them all harsh U.S. Southern accents, it would pull you even further away from believing in who they are portraying, so it's just like an extra prop that enhances the presentation.To those historic critics who try to rip up every attempt Hollywood makes to tell a story, I have this to say: Sad as it may be, but if I had not seen ""Schindler's List,"" I would not have as much an appreciation for the Holocaust.  I don't read much history, so if Hollywood with it's jaded glitz & glamour can emotionally move me to appreciate a moment of history, then so be it!  And speaking of important moment's of history, you should check out ""Uprising,"" another great historic drama that deserves attention (about the Jewish ghetto uprising).At any rate, now for why I give K-19 five stars.  I enjoyed the drama, the tension, the cast, and the story.  It's that simple.  I still think ""U-571"" is the best sub movie I've ever seen, perhaps because of how tightly the movie went with not a second of downtime, but K-19 is a more human, dramatic story that is important to see.  The DVD has several documentaries on how they made the movie that should be seen by the history critics, as it certainly seems like they did much research on the topics & history before shooting the film.  If the director had a gap, then it needed to be filled, and a story has to be interesting or it becomes a bad movie.  Never will everyone be happy, and that's why most reviews will differ.  So take it from a person who watches movies to be entertained, moved, and even educated at times, K-19 is an excellent movie.",N/A
526955,"This has got to be Jackie's best movie so far! Even better than Rush Hour. Yes, I am a Jack Chan fan. Not a fan of Martial Arts movies in general, but Jackie always plays such a nice, innocent guy, and his movies are always so full of comedy and hilarious fighting action, that it's hard not to become a loyal Chan fan. Shanghai Noon is no exception, and the chemistry between Jackie and the always hilarious Owen Wilson is wonderful! The plot is simple, but works great for the comedy and fighting sequences that are the real focus here. Jackie plays Chon Wang, a misfit member of the Chinese Royal Guard. When the Princess runs away to America to avoid marrying a less than charming suitor, Chon manages to join the rescue party. But while riding across the old west aboard a train, the men experience a hold-up, and Chon's uncle is unfortunately killed. Chasing after the villains, Chon is quickly seperated from his companions and alone in the unfriendly and wild, old west. He stumbles upon a tribe of Sioux Indians, and after a night of puffing on the peace pipe, wakes up with a beautiful new wife that he really doesn't want. Not long after that, he makes friends with the laid-back, talkative, and bumbling outlaw-wannabe, Roy O'Bannon (Owen Wilson). Roy proceeds to teach the humorless Chon the ways of the west, but is the worst teacher anyone could possibly hope to team up with. The laughs flow continuously, as Roy and Chon try to survive against the likes of Marshall Nathan Van Cleef, the evil Lo Fong, and Crazy Wallace, the train robbing Texan, all the while determined to rescue the Chinese Princess from her new captors.The movie is typically sweet comedy from kickster Jackie Chan and smooth talker Owen Wilson, backed by a great soundtrack of modern cowboy songs like ""I Wanna Be A Cowboy,"" and ""Back In the Saddle Again."" The DVD has a nice pile of extras too.  You just can't go wrong by picking this one up if you like a good laugh and a sweet story with a feel-good ending.",Shanghai Noon
452856,"Where in the name of Haddonfield is my damn director/Jamie Lee Curtis commentary?? Apparently I'm oblivious, because in reading another review I just discovered that the ' Bonus Commentary ' advertised on the back cover of my DVD is nonexistent! I just sat down a few minutes ago to watch this movie again ( which I purchased used almost a year ago ), this time with the running commentary, and damned if I couldn't locate it. There is a mistake on the older DVD's apparently that advertises a commentary track that doesn't exist. Shame on you, Dimension Films! Oh well, guess I shouldn't believe everything I read. As for the movie itself..not bad. If you are new to the Halloween franchise, let me recommend that you watch a triple feature, Halloween, Halloween 2 ( takes place the same nite..like one long movie ) and Halloween H2O, which takes place 20 years after that nite.Halloween 3-6 really have nothing to do with the ' trilogy ' , and in the case of #3, have absolutely NOTHING to do with the Michael Myers story. Avoid #6 at all costs..it's an absolutely abysmal movie, which brings up the subject of the new #8 film starring Busta Rhymes that has yet to be released, which has all the writings of a quick-cash travesty on it, but I digress. Halloween H20 is a short film, under 90 minutes, and upon first viewing, it felt TOO short..but now I think it's just right. Michael Myers is back to finish off his sister, but she has something else in mind. Jamie Lee Curtis delivers an excellent performance in this movie, her best in my opinion. Critics may dismiss her performance, because let's face it, this is the seventh Halloween movie, we aren't talking about Citizen Kane here. I urge you to watch this movie once for the fun of it, and then again for her performance..Curtis is in such command of her performance, shows such strength, that it all but screams &quot; This franchise is nothing without me, I OWN this movie &quot;. Great work by her, which will be tarnished somewhat by the next movie, in which rumor has it, she is killed off early on. What a shame, because they could have ended the story with H20. This is not Star Wars here, but in the realm of horror, Halloween is legendary, and it felt right to end it after the last movie. Oh well, money rules the world. So anyways, if you haven't seen this movie yet, don't watch it without seeing the first 2 in the series, because it will mean much more to you than if you saw it on it's own. Still not happy about that missing commentary track though..I would love to hear what Curtis has to say about the movie and her performance.",Halloween H20 VHS
414336,"The production team of Hecht-Hill-Lancaster made film history by winning the first ever Best Picture Oscar by an independent with an offbeat film, ""Marty"", in which Ernest Borgnine secured a Best Actor statuette.  Some three years later the group with a penchant for strong but highly unconventional stories scored again with ""Separate Tables.""Set in a boarding house in a British seaside resort, ""Separate Tables"" appraises the lives of people who often are seeking to escape from the real world, as well as those who attempt to oversee and manipulate others.  Two of the chief characters in the film fall into those distinct categories, David Niven, who won a Best Actor Oscar as a man who has manufactured a glittering military career and harbors a tragic secret, and stellar British character performer Gladys Cooper, a meddlesome presence who unearths that secret and seeks to have Niven evicted from the premises.  The chief reason for her determined venom is that Deborah Kerr, her tortured daughter who suffers from her suffocating domination, is attracted to Niven.The drama also has a fascinating romantic triangle as an indigeouns element of its plot.  Co-producer Burt Lancaster plays an American writer with a tragic past who seeks to bury it in alcohol, spending the greater part of his time at a nearby pub.  His romance with the establishment's proprietor, Wendy Hiller, who secured a Best Supporting Actress Academy Award for her brilliant effort, is suddenly threatened with the arrival of a guest.  Rita Hayworth, wife of co-producer James Hill at the time, is from a more socially upscale society and appears out of place at the decidedly middle class boarding house.  She is a glamorous internationally renowned model.  Though she attempts to deny it, Hayworth is there to rekindle her old romance to former husband Lancaster, who in a fit of rage once attempted to kill her, doing prison time for his attempt.  We also learn that Hayworth's life has diminished from its earlier aristocratic pedestal.The film was a melding of two Terence Rattigan one act plays, which he adapted to the screen with John Gay.  Delbert Mann directs with steadiness, allowing the drama to flourish without anyone going over the edge.  The sparks are there, but never in incredulous suberabundance.  The final mystery which is brilliantly unraveled is whether Gladys Cooper will prevail in getting Niven to leave the establishment after it is learned that he has been involved in a local scandal at a cinema.  The resolution is deftly handled, dramatic without histrionics, which was the hallmark of the entire cinema gem.  Deborah Kerr's future also hangs in the balance with her ultimate decision.",Separate Tables VHS

DS9 comes back to TV. The Enterprise saga could warp ahead to the current Trek timeline if fans demanded it. I long for the days of seeing DS9 and NG each week. They should have played them back to back and it would have gotten better ratings. I am very surprised they didn't cross over the two shows with both casts meeting together.What can I say without repeating the other reviewers? Buy this one. You can see the episodes again and again. Just like the original series and still want more. There are still plenty of stories left to tell about DS9 and here's one more fan who wishes they'd come back.On an added note the extras were real sparse.  One I thought could have been better was the one with the props. The mini film takes you into a basement like room where all the DS9 props are stored.  It must have been shot on a shoestring budget.  There was no music or anything to make it appear special.  The interview with Nana Visitor looked like it was taken from one of those entertainment programs like ET.  The most recent interview for the DVD was very brief.How about director commentary for each episode.  The least they could have done was to get some of the actors to do a commentary on a couple of episodes.  J.M.S. did some with the first season of B5.

542596,"Kiss of the Dragon (KOD), is primarily a vehicle for the limber Mr. Li, to display his considerable martial arts talents. The storyline is not particularly strong, and is largely an example of style over substance. This is neither bad, nor unusual, for a film of this type. Most of the audience is looking for action, and that is what is delivered. The violence is excessive, and the plot takes unrealistic turns more than once. The color tones are subdued, shaded to dull hues, with even daytime scenes shot in shadows. Through the numerous creative fights, and action sequences, Jet Li performs with speed, and deadly seriousness. He continues to improve his acting and English communication skills.Li plays Liu Jian, a policeman from the People's Republic of China, sent to Paris, to participate in the arrest of a Chinese drug dealer, by the French police. Inspector Richard (Tcheky Karyo), the French cop in charge of the investigation, kills the dealer with Jian's gun, intending to frame him for the murder. Of course for this silly plan to work, Jian must die. Unfortunately for Richard, he just won't cooperate. Mixed into this basic conflict, is a prostitute, played by Bridget Fonda, who could also possibly help clear Liu Jian.The commentary track consists of separate comments by Jet Li, Bridget Fonda and director Chris Nahon, edited to together. It is somewhat informative technically, but Fonda's comments, reflecting mostly her personal thoughts, dominate. Her character doesn't have a lot of depth, but judging by her comments, Fonda seems satisfied with her role. The other bonus features are rather typical fare. The DVD itself is made to look like a red, number 3 billiard ball. Such a ball is featured in one of the movie's CG stunts.Hong Kong veteran Cory Yuen choreographed the exciting fight scenes, and Luc Besson did KOD's screenplay. Tcheky Karyo, does a pretty good job as an arrogant, and corrupt cop. His ultimate reward, is to experience the ""kiss of the dragon"". Burt Kwouk, also makes an appearance as a shopkeeper. Jet Li's fighting skills are obvious, and his acting skills are improving too.

65883,"...even though on the whole, it's a good movie.The part that doesn't make sense to me is the plot device of wife Doris Day's having been a singing star before her marriage to James Stewart. Yet when we first encounter her in the bus with Stewart and afterwards, she seems only like a doctor's wife. Then comes the info that before she tied the knot, she was known throughout Europe. Well, how realistic is that? How many singing stars just chuck it all to marry a doc from Indianapolis and then go on about how her trip to Morocco was paid for by an appendectomy? It just wouldn't ever have happened, period. I think (and this doesn't spoil anything for those who haven't seen the movie; they can just hold this idea in their mind) a better way to have worked this was that she IS a singing star still, but her doctor husband is a RICH doctor, not some country bumpkin type. Because she's not travelling under her stage name, that's why the secret agent makes his initial mistake about the two couples. Everything else that hinges upon her singing can fall into place neatly after that.Otherwise, ""The Man Who Knew Too Much"" has lots of suspenseful moments, very much in the vein of ""North by Northwest"". Yet, it is not as good as that movie, because it seems more episodic, less like a single thread.  Really, the movie is one big chase scene, as Doris and Jimmy track down the kidnappers of their son from Morocco to the Albert Hall and beyond. I will say, though, that the movie really is Doris'. The husband could've been played by anyone--all the intensity is contained within her. She is quite excellent in the scene when he tells her that the child has been kidnapped. I guess she can be considered yet another talent not fully utilized in Hollywood, acting-wise. She got to be hysterical again in ""Midnight Lace"", but I'm sure she could move beyond hysteria into something else--although I thought she did a poor job in ""Love Me or Leave Me"" with another James, James Cagney.Closing remark: Should've been ""The Woman Who Found Out Too Much"", but still entertaining.",N/A

The tagline of Wilde's play (in the backcover of the Penguin Books edition I own) reads: &quot;In order to be a successful blackmailer, one's own reputation must be beyond reproach&quot;. In Wilde's play, the &quot;bracelet scene&quot; involves the cool Lord Goring and the scheming Mrs Cheveley. Why, why was the scene omitted from the movie?! Did the filmmaker find it difficult to produce the special-clasp bracelet? As a result, the movie fails to capture the most important point of the play and becomes only an average fare with a plot that fizzles out in the end. Instead of an embarrassed and defeated Mrs Cheveley who unexpectedly gets a taste of her own medicine (as in Wilde's play), the movie gives us a rather smug, victorious (and heaven forbid, almost &quot;virtuous&quot;) Mrs Cheveley in the end. This is totally different from what Wilde intended in his play and I find the omission of the &quot;bracelet scene&quot; to be a bad and unforgivable mistake on the filmmaker's part. Ugh! Hugely dissapointing!Watch the movie if you must, for its fine cast, beautiful costumes and witty lines (many taken verbatim from the play, of course). Just don't expect to experience the 'true spirit' of Wilde's play. The omission of the &quot;bracelet scene&quot; certainly took away all my enjoyment of this adaptation.",Ideal Husband VHS
676940,"As much as I like &quot;The Lord Of The Rings: FOTR&quot;, I still think that Moulin Rouge was the better picture.  (and &quot;A Beautiful Mind&quot; was not worthy of the Oscar).  &quot;Moulin Rouge&quot; is a sweeping love story.  A simple and somewhat redundant plot that pulls at your heart every chance it gets.  Nicole Kidman and Ewan McGreggor are on fire here as the star-crossed lovers from different worlds.  Jim Broadbent is wonderful as the owner of the club.  The entire film is an over-the-top fantasy.  The visuals fly at you at amazing speeds and the intricate musical production is amazing.  Did you ever think you would hear Nirvana's &quot;Smell Like Teen Spirit&quot; woven into a musical?  I love the spin on The Police's &quot;Roxanne&quot;.  Yes, the movie seems sappy.  Yes, it's unrealistic and maybe even a bit too contrived.  But it's one of a kind, and Lurhrmann let's you know right from the first frame of picture, that this is going to be a roller coaster ride of a film.  A highly stylized romantic musical, that makes you hope that Baz Luhrmann will be making films for a long time to come.",N/A
164624,"Jane Austen is a fine writer, but her wordiness tends to drain the life from many of her characters.  Thankfully, Emma Thompson recognized the limitations of the novel and adapted her screenplay accordingly, enhancing the humor of the original story and heightening drama to make the film more captivating.  A cast was then chosen, made up of very talented thespians, including Miss Thompson herself.  Add to that splendid English landscapes, excellent directing, haunting music, and superb cinematography, and what emerges is a modern masterpiece.This is no movie for action fans; it is far too cerebral and requires a serious attention span.  For those who enjoy a good love story well told, this film delivers.  The characters are three-dimensional and their dilemmas full of human drama, bound as they are by the morals and manners of the times.  Three sisters and their mother are left virtually penniless by the stricture against females inheriting property then in place in English law.  The half-brother to the Dashwood women receives it all, but his selfish wife talks him out of helping his stepmother and half-sisters.  It is up to the two older girls---sensible Elinor and passionate Marianne---to seek their fortunes in romance while lacking a dowry to help them.Elinor finds her soulmate in shy, retiring Edward Ferrars, brother of the selfish sister-in-law, a man lacking in the usual Victorian ambitions.  Her budding romance is shelved when his sister makes it clear that Elinor is ""unsuitable"" for Edward.  The sisters and their mother then go to stay in a cottage owned by a kindly relative, Sir John, and his mother-in-law, the irrepressible Mrs. Jennings.  The old woman is a confirmed gossip and matchmaker, bound to see one of the two sisters hitched up to Colonel Brandon, the most eligible bachelor in the area.Brandon first sees Marianne singing a melancholy song and is incurably smitten.  She in turn loses her heart to a dashing young man named Willoughby, who is her ideal of a Victorian-era gentleman, complete with a pocket book of sonnets.  Brandon, who loves her more than his own happiness, steps aside and even encourages their relationship, despite his dislike for the handsome rogue.Things take an unexpected turn for the worse for both sisters---Willoughby abruptly drops Marianne and flees to London with no explanation and Elinor discovers that Edward is engaged to a shallow young woman named Lucy Steele.  The ensuing twists and turns in the plot make this film both agonizing and entertaining to watch.  Mercifully, everyone winds up happy at the end wedded to the right person.The whole film is solidly done, but it is the acting that really shines.  Thompson is perfect for the role of the calmer sister, while Winslett is brilliant as the mercurial Marianne.  Grant is endearing as the gentle Edward; Rickman finally gets to display his considerable ability to act the part of a very good and unselfish man.  The rest of the cast keeps pace with the leads, and Hugh Laurie is indescribably funny as the sarcastic Mr. Palmer.  One very beautiful aspect of this movie, along with the tendency to get drawn into the story, is the evocative musical score that tugs at the heartstrings.All in all, this is a wonderful example of a film genre that is so often overlooked in today's world---period romance.  More movies like this one desperately need to be produced.  Buy this one today because it's a gem, perfect for an afternoon of inclement weather with your own soulmate.",Sense & Sensibility

This mess of a film is so stupid, sexually tame, kinky extreme, and plot pointless that it's a miracle it was even made.  I'm sure the book it was based off of was ok but other than that you really must question why bother.Dolph Lundergen plays a guy who returns to his home town because his wealthy brother has been murdered.  His wife seems upset and the mother is devasted.  the movie takes place in the 1970's so they try to have this old movie feel to it.  Try again pal.

58234,"If I am feeling nostalgic for the glory years of high school I have a very simple cure.  Dazed and Confused.  Now I didn't go to high school in the 70's or in Texas, in fact it was the 90's and in Georgia, but it doesn't matter, Dazed and Confused is universal.  Perhaps that is the ultimate truth behind Richard Linklater's gem.  In any case this film serves as a testimate to the fact that while we might get older, high school will always be the same.So maybe this sounds familiar.  It is the last day of school and everyone from the jocks, to the geeks, to the stoners, to that lone senior that flunked, can't wait for the Summer to begin.  Why?  To party, chase girls, beat up incoming freshmen, get, um, ""enlightened,"" muse about life, go to concerts, tangle in fights, and drink beer, what else?  This is pretty much where we find the amazing young ensemble cast of Dazed and Confused that includes Ben Affleck, Parker Posey, Cole Hauser, Matthew McConaughey, Adam Goldberg, Nicky Katt, Milla Jovovich, and Joey Lauren Adams amongst others.  And they deliver in one classic scene after another.Undoubtedly if you watch this movie some of these people will remind you of people you knew, another one of the gifts of the film.  In addition to the cast is the soundtrack which is one of the better soundtracks ever essembled for a film.  It seemlessly drives and motivates the action from scene to scene.  This film is a standing reminder to the viewer how wonderful it was to be young.  At least that's what Dazed and Confused is about to me.",Dazed and Confused
587602,I've always been fascinated by Jack the Ripper so I figured this movie would be great. Too bad it lacked a strong story and good direction. Sure the imagery is beautiful but the characters are often stiff and lifeless. The story drags on a bit. It moves too slow and the ending is unsatisfying. Johnny Depp does not appear to be the great investigator you'd expect in this movie and Jack the Ripper fails to frighten even the towns people. It's not what I expected.,From Hell
67005,"I did enjoy this movie, even as I enjoyed Martin Lawrence and Eddie Murphy's more popular and critically acclaimed work.  They are a pair of convicts, one of whom caught up after being ""along for the ride"", but jailed nonetheless for life in the South some fifty years ago.  They do persevere after, through and despite any number of bad (some unbelievable) circumstances.  Life in prison makes them close.It is very different from my other favorite prison movie, Cool Hand Luke.  Like C.H.L., the brutality of prison life is left mercifully for other films.  There is one scene common to both, though, with the prisoners resolving their issue boxing in the prison yard with typical results.As they age, their mutual disappointment makes their friendship ebb and flow from like to dislike and back (of course).  Conservative Lawrence (yeah, him) not only blames the typically hustling Murphy for getting him into the situation in the first place.  Murphy wants more assertiveness from his sidekick, vowing not to die having given up hope like his Father.  As we know they must though,  they find some hope, some enjoyment, and even some meaning in their circumstance.Another reviewer hit the nail on the head: this movie was erroneously marketed.  The trailers show hilarity, and lead one to think this is a true comedy.  Those expecting just that may be disappointed (unless they go straight to the hilarious outtakes).  But it is much much more.Fantastic ending.  Worth the price itself.",N/A
570133,"First off, I really enjoyed this film. Years ago, I'd heard references to its tale and always wanted to see it. Now that I have, I am not disappointed. The tale of the loyal 47 retainers is a classic.However, the film moves very slowly. And justly so. The first hour alone (the film's approx 3.5 hrs long) is just to set up the actual problem. This is a story that takes time to tell. It's complicated and it's deeply rooted in Japanese culture. The viewer needs time to comprehend the situation. If you're looking for an action film, look elsewhere. Even when the 47 go into action, the fights are over quickly.The cast is strong. If you're a fan of Japanese cinema, you'll appreciate some of the recognizable names and faces. Plus, you can't go wrong with Toshiro Mifune. Visually, the film is lovely to look at. The music is quite good, as well.So, I would recommend this film, but only to the right viewer.",N/A
393052,"As a huge Kevin Smith fan I find it strange that the only movie of his to be truly (and unfairly) bashed by critics is the one that Universal Studios backed.  Having a studio exec on set whispering in Kevin's ear ""you can't do that!"" every time something funny was shot almost ruined the movie.  Personally. Mallrats is a little bit funnier than Clerks (although not as original), and much funnier than Chasing Amy or Dogma.  The only View Askew film that is funnier is Jay and Silent Bob Strike Back.  If you liked the humor in Clerks, give Mallrats a go.  Jason Lee is pure comic genious (Funniest and most quotable actor in all of Smith's films) and only has a better performance in Almost Famous than in any of Smith's movies.",Mallrats VHS
548016,"Although the figure of Mary Stuart has always been distorted by Hollywood, this is a good movie which is actually an attempt at giving us a glimpse at the women, not the Queens, in their historic context.Unfortunately, even this one is a bit sweet with Mary and goes on hard on Elizabeth.The players are all first class, starting with a Clash of Titans between Vanessa Redgrave and Glenda Jackson. Two female screen giants fighting out in front of our own eyes. What a feast.Then come the other giants: Trevor Howard, Ian Holm, Patrick McGoohan, Harry Andrews and many more othe British Screen legends. A real treat in Stardom and a who's who in this movie.Just for that it is highly recommendable.Now two points of woe.First: in all these years (the movie dates back to 1971) do you think that Universal Pictures could have released at least one Widescreen version of it? Noooooh, the Gentlemen went on producing other insignificant stuff, but never cared on re-releasing this one in Letterbox format.Second: although I liked it when it was released, especially for its cast and more than beautiful music scored by John Barry, why wasn't an attempt made at remaking it in a more true to history perspective?After all Mary was not as innocent as depicted by Katie Hepburn or even Vanessa Redgrave. This is Folk Lore not History!Mary was raised in France in exile, but pretty soon took a keen interest in politics and started plotting all by herself to take possession of the English Crown.These were not the figments of the imagination of Elizabeth, but a hard and harsh reality that the English Crown and the Parliament both took immediately very seriously.Mary tried it with whomever would have listened to her and would have granted her protection in doing so. She tried to drag the French on her side at first. When this didn't work, she tried the Italians, through the Pope. then came the Spaniards and ultimately the Scots. And they all fell for her.The reasons for her mad conviction of being the only true Queen of England were inculcated into her by her family due to some contentions they had already back in Henry VIII's Reign.All this though was certainly not enough to make her the legitimate Queen of England and she should have contented herself by already being Queen of the Scots.Anyway, she remains a pathetic and sad figure in History and well deserves a movie such as this one as a remainder that at times it is better to be happy with what one already has, rather than wanting the whole pie.In this instance Mary truly was too immature and too arrogant to admit defeat even if it loomed right in front of her eyes.And arrogance as we all know, gets so often repaid with a harsh punishment. In her case she lost her head over it.Some may say that she fought for religion's sake. Is any religion a valid justification for human sacrifice? Especially of other people, rather than your own. Of course not, and yet Mary never hesitated in sending innocent people to be slaughtered in her name.Some may pity her, some may condemn her, but the fact still remains that she was an intriguing figure wonderfully portrayed by Vanessa Redgrave. And right or wrong, she did exist and should therefore be depicted in at least one movie.Between Katie Hepburn and Vanessa, I still prefer Vanessa. Glenda Jackson reprises her role Elizabeth R in this one and she's one strong butch of a woman, a hard nut to crack. No wonder that men lost their heads (in more than one way) for her.Anyway, this one with Elizabeth and Elizabeth R, should be movies to be bought and cherished dearly like good wine. After all it is seldom they make movies like these.And if you're interested by more Tudor Lore, try also ""Henry VIII and his Six Wives"", ""Anne of the Thousand Days"", the filmed Play by Robert Bolt ""A Man For All Seasons"".The King is dead, long live the Queen...","Mary, Queen of Scots VHS"

The Grinch and his dog and Cindy Lou are so funny and true to character, for you not see they are like what Dr. Seuss would picture them is blindly protesting.

Also, even though the rapport between Buzz and Woody is great, the same can also be said of that between Shrek and Donkey. I've already seen Shrek about 5 times, which says quite a bit considering that animated films aren't normally a genre I normally go for.

595010,"Having come up with a massive hit with THE SIXTH SENSE and then taken a few steps back with the bland UNBREAKABLE, writer/producer/director M. Nyght Shayamalan has re-emerged with a winning science fiction/suspense film in SIGNS.Mel Gibson stars as a priest in rural Pennsylvania who, because of the loss of his wife, has lost his faith and quit the church.  But when crop circles appear in his cornfield, his sheltered life with his children and his younger brother (Joaquin Phoenix) takes a weird turn.  As they continue to watch TV, they hear of more crop circles turning up all over the world until finally strange lights are spotted in the night skies over Mexico.  Gibson becomes more and more unglued and paranoid; and in the ensuing siege on his house, he must regain his faith to survive.Although it is still too early in the game to consider Shayamalan ""the next Spielberg"" (especially when the REAL Spielberg is still making superlative movies himself), SIGNS does show some of the Spielberg touches--suspense, shock effects, ordinary people and extraordinary circumstances.  Gibson gives one of his best performances as the priest whose confrontations with the alien forces see him regaining his faith but nearly losing his mind in a wash of paranoia.  As was the case in THE SIXTH SENSE, Shayamalan leaves little clues for the audience to follow as to how the story will eventually come out.  Shayamalan also pulls a Hitchcock by making his own cameo appearance as a local neighbor with a slightly sinister look.Although probably not quite the masterpiece that THE SIXTH SENSE had been, SIGNS is nevertheless suspenseful sci-fi entertainment, scary at times but never jaw-droppingly violent.  James Newton Howard's score occasionally echoes his score for THE SIXTH SENSE but even shows the influences of Stravinsky and Bernard Herrmann.  It is a very good film, and comes highly recommended.",Signs

Not everything is drama all the time, not even in the mob! At the Oscars this movie was robbed and I feel horrible. At least Pesci won, thank god.

212973,"Stephen King is a really good writer, even though he has become known as the king of horror. However, the best Stephen King stories are the one's that really aren't horror stories, such as ""Rita Hayworth and the Shawshank Redemption"" and THE GREEN MILE. Not surprisingly, these are the same stories that when adapted have been turned into the best movies.  THE DEAD ZONE is another one of these films.THE DEAD ZONE is about a teacher named Johnny Smith (brilliantly played by Christopher Walken). After a mysterious night at a carnival, Johnny gets in a car accident after dropping off his girlfriend.  He survives the accident but enters a coma and awakens to find himself several years in the future. His entire life has changed seemingly overnight. However, not only that, but Johnny now posesses a psychic gift that allows him to see possible events in the future and events that have occurred in the past. The ""gift"" seems like a curse and separates Johnny from the rest of the world. The movie builds up to the point when Johnny meets a man running for the US Senate.  He sees the evil in the man and the destruction of the world if he is elected. So the question is raised, if you could go back in time and kill Hitler, would you?THE DEAD ZONE stays fairly close to the King novel it is based upon. There really isn't any horror here, just a tasty morsel of the supernatural.  Walken, who so often finds trouble finding good work because of his peculiar physical appearance and voice, fits the part of Johnny Smith perfectly. Also memorable is Tom Skerrit in the role of a local sheriff and Martin Sheen as the shady politician. The movie is worth watching and serves as a good introduction to some of the non-horror writings of Stephen King.",N/A

Watching Gene Wilder's character (Leo Bloom) evolve from a shy, neurotic accoutant to outrageous Broadway Producer is also great fun. The jokes come at you so fast that you have to actually pay close attention or you'll miss the best parts. This is especially true of the visuals. These are classic Brooks sight gags that usually come from Mel's naughty sense of humor - watch for the camera panning back from Max's broken hand in a plaster cast during the court room scene with crying old ladies in the background. To die for. The Producers is the entire Brooks joke book in a nutshell....Maybe this is not the best movie for really young kids because of the underlying theme - Max having sex with older, shall we say mature, women for money - but it's played with so much energy and good humor that most teenagers should be able to handle it.

691647,"Novocaine is the story of Steve Martin playing a dentist who digs himself into a hole of drugs, deceit, and murder, precipitated by a pretty drug dealer (Helena Bonham Carter) who visits his office and talk him into writing her a prescription for demerol. Told from the dentist's point of view, we know he didn't steal the drugs or commit the murder, but suspicion shifts back and forth amongst the other 4 main characters: the druggie, her brother (Caan), the dentist's hygenist/fiance (Dern), and his brother (Koteas).  What's great about the movie is that there is no cheating - the eventual outcome is logical, and clues are placed along the way that are consistent with the eventual solution to the mystery.  On hindsight, the characters moved towards their fates with a Greek inevitability, but you can't predict the results beforehand.  Even though the ultimate solution involves a course of action that dedicated movie/TV viewers have seen before, it's the journey to that inevitable point that interests us.The performances are good.  The screenplay doesn't cheat.  The direction is sure, at least in the second half.  Unfortunately, it took me a long time to get into the film - perhaps it's because it's not quite what you expect of a Steve Martin movie.  The first half is violent and eerie, the second half loosens up and the natural charisma of Carter and Martin starts to show through.  It is at that point that you start to care about the characters, which is vital in being drawn into a suspense thriller.  Similarly, Martin's natural comedic niche - the smart man who is bewildered by his inability to deal with a situation - is not obvious in the first half of the film, making the direction seem heavy-handed and the suspense seem too thick.This DVD edition has some short features and a few cut scenes.

536938,"Sports fans probably remember Fox Sports Net's series of commercials a year or two ago, advertising the new ""Regional Sports Reports"". These spots featured absurd imaginary sports being played in some dry and dusty location which looked vaguely Central Asian. The tag line was, ""sports news from the only region you care about --- yours.""This new version of Rollerball looks like it was taken from one of those FSN commercials. Gone is the SF storyline of the original story. Rather than set the story in the future, the film makers transposed it to Central Asia in the present day, post-Soviet world.The game vaguely resembles the original Rollerball, but is so hastily edited and poorly choreographed that nothing of what made the original game so compelling remains. It's just blow stuff up. Instead of drama, you get bashed in faces. In fact, although there's plenty of mindless action, there's actually less game footage than in the original... and less action.Jean Reno delivers a terrible performance as the capitalist mogul who is (gasp!) deliberately cranking up the violence in the game for (gasp!) higher ratings. With the wretched script he's given, he could hardly be expected to fill the shoes of the role played by John Houseman, the icy corporate chief of the original.As for Chris Klein... Granted, he doesn't have much of a script to work with, but I still found his performance annoying.  I've seen him do better work (""Election"") but he doesn't project the kind of screen presence James Caan did in the original.Curiously, although the script dispenses with the science fiction background, it does have men and women playing on the same team, and showering in co-ed locker rooms. I seriously doubt there is a culture anywhere on Earth today where men and women would participate in full contact sports together, let alone get undressed in the same locker room. There would have to be some very intense social upheaval to make that happen, particularly in Central Asia, which is a fairly conservative part of the world.If you thought ""Replicant"" was a great movie, then you might like this one; but frankly, folks, Chris Klein's performance makes Jean Claude van Damme look like Olivier. In fact even ""Replicant"" is mildly more interesting than this new ""Rollerball"". At least van Damme can do the splits.",Rollerball VHS

But if you want a superbly acted story about one man's blindness to the effect his Irish pigheadedness has on others and how it can destroy what he says he loves, this is the movie for you.",N/A

334316,"NORTH AND SOUTH is one of those once in a decade televisionevents that is so astonishing that once you see it, you never forget it (Actually, the producers of this miniseries did it again in 1986, with the even better miniseries NORTH AND SOUTH, BOOK 2. Sadly, they failed with HEAVEN AND HELL: NORTH AND SOUTH, BOOK 3). I was only one year old when the miniseries first came out. When I finally saw it, I was impressed by the superb acting by all of the actors, and the battle sequences were handled with the utmost care, making them look both exciting AND accurate. It takes you back to that time before the Civil War began, and shows us the many reasons why the bloodiest war on the face of the continent was fought. Great to use as both a tool for study AND great for those who love masterful storytelling. Grade: A+",N/A
385794,"A Hard Day's Night is one of those films that are highly praised, but not quite the masterpiece it's heralded as.Perhaps it's overrated because of its groundbreaking nature in 1964. This film is the origin of music videos, and the reason we have MTV, VH1 and other music channels now.But when you look at it now, some thirty years later, many of the film's flaws are all too noticeable. Most note worthy, the acting by the Beatles isn't up to snuff. It improves in their later films, but several of their lines here are down-right cringe worthy. Also, much of the camera work is unintentionally shaky. One could argue they were doing it for the film's somewhat documentary approach, but it seems more likely they were rushed for time with the Beatle's busy schedule, as many scenes were steady, while others were shaky.But despite these flaws, the film is still very enjoyable. It's clear the Fab Four were having a blast making this film, ad libbing many of the lines. At times, their comments are surprisingly racy for the time, and it adds to their youthful vigor here. Despite no clear plot, the film still works, almost documentary-like, aided in part by the shaky camera work.I prefer the Beatles follow up film Help!, a much better produced story with louder laughs. That film shows the Beatles becoming more comfortable in their movie shoes. Yet, somehow in its more polished state, it loses some of the youthful innocence the Beatles had at the very beginning of their career, which A Hard Day's Night righteously explores. Four stars for Beatles Fans, three for the average film viewer.",N/A

But in his new film, ""The Panic Room"" he deals with the relatively safe: murderers and thieves..one even with a heart of gold.The warm yet patrician Jodie Foster plays Meg Altman, recently separated from her very rich husband, who buys a NYC Brownstone equipped with a concrete and steel protected ""panic room."" She proceeds to move in with her daughter Sarah (Kristen Stewart). On their very first night there, three thieves  break in hoping to steal a cache of millions of dollars said to be stored in the safe of the panic room.Jared Leto plays the erstwhile leader of the pack and as usual he does everything he can to play against type: i.e. a crazed, doped up liar with a scruffy beard and corn-rowed hair.  When is Leto going to realize that, with his matinee idol good looks, he is really the new Robert Redford not the new Steve Buscemi? He simply does not have the acting chops to be Brad Pitt and his performance here is mostly embarrassing.Dwight Yoakum is scary and volatile as one of the theives and Forest Whitaker is the thief with the heart of gold who saves the life of Meg's diabetic daughter.The plot is the standard ""woman in peril"" one that has been around for hundreds of years and Fincher surprisingly does very little stylistically to improve upon it.""The Panic Room"" is business-as-usual for all concerned yet it can't help but be classy in a way that only Foster and Fincher can make it.",N/A

This movie, like the Hobbit, has good animation and more clever, catchy songs.  This is a telling of the end of the Lord of the Rings saga, and it does puzzle me as to why this animation team never did the Fellowship of the Ring or The Two Towers.

697025,"The Count of Monte Cristo is one of the finest novels of action and adventure ever writen.  Abridged versions often run to 350 pages or more.  Attempting to faithfully adapt this sprawling yarn to a two hour film is bound to fail and many Amazon reviewers give this movie one star and complain that too many liberties have been taken with Alexander Dumas's story.The novel is much better than the film.  That said, the film is good enough to entertain most viewers not intent on comparing the movie to Dumas's thousand page story of revenge.The story line in both novel and film centers on the revenge of Edmond Dantes, a young sailor falsely accused and imprisoned for treason in the time of Napoleon's exile on the island of Elba.  Dantes is sent to the Chateau D'If, a notorious island fortress where prisoners languish in solitary confinement until they die.Another prisoner at the Chateau D'If, the Abbe Faria, mistakenly tunnels into Dantes' cell and the two become friends.  The Abbe is a wise man who tutors his uneducated young companion, gives him the secret of the fabulous treasure of Monte Cristo, and then dies.  Dantes excapes from the prison by substituting his body for the Abbe's, finds the treasure, and becomes the Count of Monte Cristo.The rest of the film chronicles the revenge that the Count takes on all who betrayed him.The film is enjoyable from beginning to end.  The story, while not completely faithful to Dumas's novel, is engaging; the acting is first-rate, especially Jim Caviezel as the Count and Richard Harris as the Abbe; the sets and costumes are colorful, and the action sequences are carefully spaced to maintain interest and energy.Those viewers who are entertained by this fim are almost certain to love the novel.

478785,"June 10, 2002""Being John Malkovich' can't be satire.  Itscharacters are too outrageously drawn to stand infor just plain folks.  It is in its own strangeway a horror film, since it proceeds from a nightmarelogic all its own.  However, it replaces the glee ofthat more simplistic brand of entertainment with aneurotic need to batter itself, its characters, andus, with endlessly glib tortures.  It envisions aworld where every desire is a joke, every emotion amanipulation, every character a fraud.The story begins with John Cusack's character, apretentious artist and sexually frustrated husbandmarried to a frigid frump of a wife.  Forced totake a job, Cusack chases an attractive co-worker,even though she's something of a soulless,... shrew.  By means of a magic tunnel, allthree main characters enjoy life in another body,until, after numerous kinky adventures (which arenot so much tongue-in-cheek as tongue-in-canker-sore),the film winds its way to a heavily masochisticconclusion.  Without giving too much away, Cusack'scharacters ends up taking the brunt of things.This is strange because his character seemed to bethe only one in the film with any ambition, dreams,or a modicum of conscience.Undeniably an interesting film, but, unable to justifyitself or its sexual politics, `Being John Malkovich'is a frustrating and ultimately displeasing film.I recall reading somewhere that the screenwriter,Charlie Kaufman, is heavy into analysis.  Seeing hismovie, I'm not surprised.",N/A
87956,"That's right, Warner Bros has decided to release Sub-Zero to DVD, along with JLA, ROTJ Uncut, and the first five Batman episodes. Sub-Zero was originally a direct-to-video release around late 1997 that was supposed to cash in on the popularity of the Batman and Robin movie, and bridge the gap between seasons of the tv series. HOWEVER, in a rather hilarious twist, the live-action movie bombed, and WB shelved Sub-Zero for a few months so it wouldn't make the movie look worse than it already did.Sub-Zero features Mr. Freeze, one of the best villains from the now-classic Batman cartoons of the early 90's. What made this villain so memorable was the emotionless, monotone voice delivered by Michael Ansara. The villian also has some sentimental value for me, as his was the first episode of Batman I ever saw. The story revolved around Mr. Freeze taking revenge against those who killed his wife and destroyed his life, and was the most emotionally compelling piece of animation I'd seen up to that point.Sub-Zero doesn't quite match that first Mr. Freeze episode I saw, due to some minor points and the fact that I was older, but its still an excellent piece of work. It's better than the last two live-action Batmans, but falls short of Mask of the Phantasm and Return of the Joker. As a recap, Mr. Freeze eventually finds out his wife Nora is still alive, kept in suspended animation. He retreats to the north pole, where he befriends a boy and some polar bears, and spends his time searching for a cure to his wife's disease. A team of explorers accidentally shatters Nora's containment vessel, and Freeze returns to Gotham to find a live organ donor to save his wife. That donor turns out to Barbara Gordon (Batgirl), which puts Batman and Robin on a race against time to find and save her.The vocal talent is excellent, especially Michael Ansara and Kevin Conroy, who still continues to provide the voice of Batman to this day. The animation is really good for a direct-to-video release (hey, when ALL your animated movies are DTV, you tend to do a good job) and includes a lot of CGI enhancements. Some people have had problems with this, citing that the random CGI inserts detract from the movie. For me, it's no big deal, the CGI in this movie, especially of the submarine rising into the caverns in the intro, is impressive.Where the movie falls short is in that Batman feels underutilized. Granted, Batman still has a beefier role than Clooney did in the live-action movie, but Robin and Batgirl tend to eat up more screentime. Nothing wrong with this, but the movie's full title was Batman &amp; Mr. Freeze: Sub-Zero, so I expected Batman. I also thought that Barbara's various escape attempts ate up more time than they should have. Finally, the movie doesn't really escape its DTV roots. Where Batman: Mask of the Phantasm was originally a theatrical release and Return of the Joker (Uncut) could have been one, Sub-Zero feels like three episodes of the TV series, albeit three VERY GOOD episodes.Still, Sub-Zero is classic Batman. The new DVD makes for a great addition to your collection, or a great gift for a Batman fan. I've heard the supplements aren't anything overly special, just an intro by Bruce Timm and a game or two, but the disc should be relatively cheap and well worth it. Until April 23rd....",N/A
11885,"Since I had not studied up on the life of T.E Lawrence before I saw this movie, I can't tell you if the real Lawrence was like the one in this movie. I can't say how accurate it is to the history (There has been evidence found that Lawrence was never at the massacre of the Turkish Army). I too agree that the straight historical facts can be exciting. But if you go to movies expecting the truth, you will be disappointed. We go to books for facts and to movies for feelings.  ""Lawrence of Arabia"" should not marked down because it isn't a totally factual account. This is a rarity among epic movies; One that's not only visually stunning and ambitious, but also acted with enthusiasm, written with wit and excitement and directed with skill and passion.""Lawrence"" won a total of seven Academy Awards in 1962 including Best Picture. But sadly, none of its Oscars went to Peter O'Toole for his brilliant, eccentric performance as T.E Lawrence, a British Officer assigned to the Arabian Desert during World War I. There, he finds that the Arabian Tribes are fighting against one another. Lawrence unites these tribes in battle against the Turks, leading to many victories. Over time, he comes closer to discovering whom he is, why he is here and starts questioning as to whether he belongs to Arabia and England.But while O'Toole and the supporting cast (Played by the likes of Alec Guinness, Anthony Quinn, Omar Sharif, Jack Hawkins, Claude Rains, Jose Ferrer, Anthony Quayle and Arthur Kennedy) get the billings in the movie, the real star is the desert. Thought to be a barren, desolate landscape with little life, the movie proves that it is very active. Every shot seems choreographed to show the beauty and danger of Arabia. We see sandstorms, twisters and miles of beautiful sand dunes. There are some beautiful shots of sunrises or sunsets (One of them part of a memorable edit). The movie is full of many great images, one of the most memorable being the long entrance of Sharif's character, coming out of the mirage. It looks like his camel is riding on nothing. Another memorable image is when Lawrence and his companions reach the Suez Canal. Their first glimpse is of a ship sailing in the canal. But with the way the scene is filmed, it looks as though the ship is sailing on desert.The script, as I already stated, is surprisingly strong for an epic. The plot is focused and free of sideplots. The conversations between people are interesting and sometimes even exciting to listen to (Though this can also be attributed to direction, acting and/or editing). Here are some examples:General Allenby: I thought I was a hard man, sir.Prince Feisal: You are merely a general. I must be a king.Auda Abu Tayi: Thy mother mated with a scorpion.General Murray: I can't make out whether you're bloody bad-mannered or just half-witted.T.E Lawrence: I have the same problem, sir.Ali: Have you no fear, English?T.E Lawrence: My fear is my concern.General Allenby: I'm promoting you Major.T.E Lawrence: I don't think that's a very good idea.Finally, I must not ignore Maurice Jarre's music score. Like the movie, it is difficult to put in words the effect it has on a viewer. But I just dare you to forget it, any part of it. I had the main theme stuck in my head after I saw it. All I can say is that you have to watch the movie for yourself (Or rent the CD soundtrack) to understand.I wonder what it would be like if this movie were remade today. It would for certain be much different. To cut costs, there would be CGI sets and extras. There would have to be big name stars (Arnold Schwarzenegger as T.E Lawrence?). The movie would have more stylized and graphic violence than it original did and the pace would be fast and furious, with constant F-words. Finally, to appeal to a wider audience, there would have to be a romantic subplot involving Lawrence with a young British or Arabian woman who can't keep her clothes on (Though it's been said that Lawrence never had a girlfriend because he was sensitive to touching). Also, the movie would be shot not in the Arabian Desert but on some blue screen or studio backlot.Lawrence lived to see himself become a legend. Those white robes he wears give him the image of a saint (Other hidden clues: Lawrence mentions Moses when he crossed the Nefud and the word god is used often throughout). He believed that he was different from others and even invincible. After being shot in the arm and asked if he needs a doctor, Lawrence remarks ""It would take a golden bullet to kill me"". But after being beaten and (implied) raped, he realizes that he isn't above other men, that any man ""Is what I am"". He soon loses hope in the campaign he's leading and by movie's end is not wanted by either the Arabs or the British. Thus, it seems fitting that, like Patton and MacArthur, Lawrence's death came not on a battlefield, but in a common motor accident.",N/A
228197,"Arnold Schwarzenegger stars in Predator, a hit box office film that hit the shelves and automatically flew off within the few first months of its release. This film has always been one of my favorites from Arnold, ever since I was 12 years old. When I finally went out and purchased a DVD Player, Predator was one of the very first DVDs that came to mind, because, 1)I knew a spectacluar film had to produce a spectacluar DVD, and 2)I would finally get to see this film in widescreen anamorphic format with 5.1 Dolby Digital Surround Sound.This isn't just an action movie, its a sci-fi/action/suspense movie with a pot full of astonishing actors. I give credit to the directors of this film for choosing such an excellent cast. A cast that includes Sonny Landham, Carl Weathers, Jesse Ventura, and Arnold Schwarzenegger. And who could forget the HUGE 7 foot tall Keven Peter Hall that played the Predator. This is one of the films that set Arnold Schwarzenegger to fame through the 90s, also backed up by Commando and The Terminator, which were also box office hits as well (I have those on DVD also). It seems almost every film Schwarzenegger has starred in has produced a spectacluar DVD.I believe there are two different versions of this DVD; one has the full screen version and THX Surround Sound, and the other one has the Widescreen version, THX Surround Sound, 5.1 Dolby Digital, and extra features. The latter of the two is somewhat rare...I haven't seen many copies, but I was fortunate enough to find one in [a store]somewhere.This film is great, and the DVD is even better. Many scenes really capture the effects of the THX which adds to the climax and the recessive parts of the movie. The audio and visual effects of this DVD are AWESOME, and I'd encourage anyone that has a DVD Player and likes action films to get this. Great movie by a great director, played by a great cast.

554843,"Set entirely on present-day Earth, this episode features Sarah (Elisabeth Sladen) and the Doctor (Tom Baker) at the height of their partnership.  Gone is the tired old plot element of trying to get Sarah back home; by now these two are an inseparable team -they take on gunmen, sneak past armed guards, finish each other's sentences, and almost seem to enjoy taking turns rescuing each another.The serial is longer than your average Doctor Who episode -six chapters instead of four.  The premise is nothing new but is still downright creepy -slow but inevitable alien possession of a human being.  The Krynoid itself, though at the low end of the BBC's already low-budget monster scale, is photographed in such a way as to make it far more terrifying -a glimpse of writhing tentacles in the moonlight.  The suspense elements are played up -the hissing rattle in the dark just outside the window, the dark halls of an Elizabethan manor house, curling creeper vines that strangle their victims, and an eerie violin soundtrack.  Besides the Krynoid and its supporting army of killer Earth plants, you get two center-stage villians: Chase (Tony Beckley), the eccentric millionaire who fancies himself the great protector of the entire plant kingdom; and Scorby (John Challis), the hired mercenary-turned uneasy ally.  Sarah's verbal dressing-down of Scorby is priceless.Tom Baker is in top form in this episode -he bullies civil servants around, crashes through skylight windows, coldcocks armed henchmen, and even packs both a sword and a gun (though Sarah points out he would never use the latter, he grins and replies, ""True.  But they don't know that, do they?"").  Though the story does briefly feature an appearance by UNIT forces, none of the Pertwee-era UNIT regulars are included.  My favorite character in this serial is the scatterbrained floral artist Amelia Ducat (Sylvia Coleridge), who goes from comic relief to vital plot link and back to comic relief again.  The miniature visual effects are, by Doctor Who standards, actually quite impressive -you get not one but two climactic moments in which entire buildings are obliterated.  Not a milestone episode for Doctor Who overall, but a must-have for Tom Baker fans.",N/A

216858,"This movie and The Day the Earth Stood Still have to be my favorite SF movies from the 50's, and possibly of any decade, although the 60's would certainly have to include 2001 and Robinson Crusoe on Mars.The special effects with the awesome, graceful, but somehow sinister manta-ray-like ships with their anti-meson disintegration rays are possibly the coolest special effect of all time in an SF movie, especially considering this was 49 years ago now. And the bubble-like shield they used to protect themselves from the nuclear blast was also pretty cool. I also liked the fact that the unusual, huge flying wing was used to drop it. (By the way, there were both turboprop and jet engine versions of this interesting aircraft).The whole movie is a class act, with terrific scenes, a good script, and fine acting. Barry and Robinson were excellent in their roles. The story of a more advanced alien race invading earth, destroying everything in their path, with our feeble and primitive technology no match for the aliens, is a classic SF theme, and as another reviewer here perceptively pointed out, it's an appropos theme for the more paranoid 50's, which saw the advent of the Cold War, the nuclear arms race with its similar threat of total annihilation, and the McCarthy era.And last but not least, another wonderful touch was the Chesley Bonestell art used at the beginning of the movie with Sir Cedrick Hardwick's narration.Altogether a great movie for its time, or any time.

236010,"Poorly conceived and misguided second sequel to 1978's &quot;Superman&quot; aims towards campy comedy and misses. Clark Kent (Christopher Reeve) returns to his hometown of Smallville for his high school reunion and is reunited with his childhood sweetheart Lana Lang (Annette O'Toole). Meanwhile, an unlikely computer genius (Richard Pryor) is recruited by an unscrupulous industrialist (Robert Vaughn) to reprogram a weather satellite so that it can create disastrous weather that will effect commodity prices. When Superman foils their scheme, the bad guys try to synthesize kryptonite to destroy him, but they get the process wrong so it instead splits Superman's personality into good and evil halves.The plot and tone of the film is reminiscent of some of the sillier &quot;Superman&quot; comic books of the 1950s and 60s. Reeve gives another good performance as Superman and Clark Kent, and even gets to stretch as an actor by playing a Man of Steel with a bad streak. As a love interest, O'Toole is a pleasing alternative to Margot Kidder's Lois Lane, who only has a cameo. But they cannot save this disappointing mess of a movie, which suffers from a miscast Pryor, the absence of a compelling story or villains, and too many jokes which are simply unfunny.",Superman 3 VHS

296425,"What I can say about this lovely movie is that it was a very original idea to show the two points of view (male and female) about the developing of their relationship. Full of tiny delicious details, both stories are perfectly credible in real life, and at the same time show moments of comic fantasy as metaphors of the way people interpret facts in real life (the narrative resource that makes the Ally McBeal's tv serie rocks!). I think the audience could identify themselves in the main characters, and that the main concept of the movie was cristal clear at the end of the movie, that, no matter the whole bunch diferences between the two stories, and between them, they loved each other. Two ways to see it, but one and only true feeling: LOVE.AND THAT'S THE WAY I SEE IT!!",N/A
467130,"There's more than one thing about There's Something About Mary. To start with, we are dealing with the brothers Farrelly. America currently has several sibling teams making movies. The Zucker brothers [Airplane, The Naked Gun] and the Coen brothers [Fargo, The Big Lebowski] are acknowledged as gifted film makers.Bobby and Peter Farrelly, however, make many reviewers quake in fear. Their aptly named Dumb and Dumber, starring Jim Carrey, was 1994's sixth most successful movie worldwide. The simple fact is that when a team can do that, a studio lets them make whatever they want for a while. Since this latest effort was the 4th biggest movie of 1998, there is even less chance of controlling their projects. They are what we call critic-proof.Some reviewers, knowing they were powerless, made venomous assaults on Mary, based usually on the fact that the movie revels in its political incorrectness. There's no doubt about that, but others, myself included, saw it as one of life's guilty pleasures. After all, in a society currently so obsessed with toeing the line, with not offending even the smallest minority group, it can be fun to see a flick that threw all caution to the wind. A large segment of the population agreed.So what groups do the Farrellys target this time around? They go after high schools kids, parents, gay men, straight men, sun worshippers, dogs, law enforcement officers, private detectives, the physically challenged, and the mentally challenged, among others. There is no agenda here. Their observations on the human condition seem to have no boundaries, and they simple did not have time to nail the entire planet.To add insult to injury, this comedy is of the gross-out variety. As most of us write for general audiences, we were forced to be less than specific about much of the picture. All I should say in print is that the more memorable moments are the zipper scene, the hair gel scene, the biting dog episode, the binoculars incident, the run in at the rest stop, and a look at what real guys do just before a hot date.So what is this thing about Mary? Part of it is that she is played by the fantastic Cameron Diaz, who I said would be a star after seeing her in My Best Friend's Wedding. I got that one right. The rest is the fact that Mary remains kind, helpful and innocent no matter what happens. While the rest of the characters fight, claw, scream and whine through life, Mary sails gracefully on.Diaz has excellent support from Ben Stiller as Ted, who has never gotten over his high school crush on her, and from Matt Dillon as Pat, the sleazy private detective Ted hires to find her. It's no surprise when Pat decides to keep Mary for himself. That's the entire plot, by the way.Throughout the movie, a vagabond keeps reappearing, singing an inane song about Mary and Ted. He eventually gets his, probably for singing off key. This element is a dead giveaway that the movie is a farce and a put on. For anyone trying to comment seriously on it, the joke seems to be on them.",N/A
367385,"Hellbound is a gothic, bloody, gory, gloomy film that might be more Hellraiser than Hellraiser.  If that makes sense.Though not directed by Clive Barker, it has his input, and the makers of this film made this a real horror sequel, continuing the story of Kirsty and family and coloring in the Cenobites further.  We even get a little bit of insight into the origins of Pinhead which will be further explored in Hellraiser 3.Is this film incoherent at times?  Yes.  Is the plot addled?  Yes.  Is there A LOT of gore including head drilling, skinning, maggots, decapitation, throat slashing, and brain sucking?  Yes.  But if you're looking for more gloom and gothic atmosphere a la the original Hellraiser, then you'll enjoy this.Hellbound is darker and has a more cynical tone than original film.  Here we find the outre Dr. Channard heading up his own psychiatric institute where Kirsty Cotton has been brought following the events of the night in the original Hellraiser.  As shes goes on and on about boxes and demons and her father in Hell the hospital medicates her.  But it turns out not only does Channard believe her, but he's been waiting for this his whole life.  He's a closet Hellraiser fanatic, so to speak, owning 3(!) boxes, having studied the mind as a labyrinth, and searched for the pleasure the Cenobites offer.It's not long before the Cenobites are summoned and Kirsty, Channard, and a newly resurrected Julia from the original are running around Hell's garish-set hallways.  All 4 Cenobites are back again, though a different actress plays the slashed-throat female, giving her a decidedly different expression.  Pinhead gets more screen time (of course) and we even get his origin, making him more than a boogeyman.Just remember, this is a gory film, even by today's horror film standards.  A lot of skinned bodies, a lot of hooks in flesh.  A long and extended scene of a fan slashing himself slowly to death.  But it all serves some twisted material which will definitely help you get in touch with your dark side.Highly recommended for horror fans.",Hellraiser 2: Hellbound VHS

704005,"This three-part ABC-TV miniseries was based on a popular series of novels about a place where humans and dinosaurs live together in a controlled but somewhat tenuous peace.Part 1 barely kept my interest, mostly because of the overly cute and fluffy tone. Still, I loved the special effects and the mythology, and decided to watch more, thinking it would get better. Parts 2 and 3 not only showed improvement but also surpassed my expectations.I enjoyed all the actors, especially Alice Krige, best know to scifi fans as the Borg Queen (Star Trek: First Contact). I also enjoyed the tension of scenes such as the rock climbing, the skybax rides, and the T-Rex invasion.Now the miniseries is out on DVD (with lots of bonus features), and will soon become a weekly series on ABC-TV (Thursday nights).

After I watched ""The Lord Of The Rings: The Fellowship Of The Ring"" for the first time, I felt so excited that I was longing for more.I have never read J.R.R. Tolkien's books, and now I am really interested in reading the story of Frodo Baggins and his journey to return the ""only one ring"".  All the cast is extraordinary, and these great actors get their job done.  Thankfully, Peter Jackson doesn't rely on visual effects heavily and his characters are not bidimensional, they are true human characters who feel the danger and the difficult task that lies ahead for them.  His crew members also did their jobs right, especially the visual effects people -led by ""Star Trek: Insurrection""'s Jim Rygiel, and Richard Taylor -who carry out their task without flooding the movie with so many effects; and Howard Shore who created his best score ever, with a little help of Enya.It would be ridiculous for me to give a summary of a story which is so wildly popular.  However, I'm pretty sure that this is a great film translation of a great literary classic, which I'll get to read some time.

I suspect that the desire to claim victory over an evil and highly dangerous enemy after the war had a great deal to do with it.Leni Riefenstahl has a great reputation as a film maker of propaganda, but so does Eisenstein, and Eisenstein did it twenty years earlier. Today's viewer is still overwhelmed by Eisenstein's genius, while Leni Riefenstahl's work is dated and often silly.",Triumph of the Will VHS
375743,"Return to Horror High, the beginning of an entire limb of horror that leaned away from trying to be truly horrible, wasn't received with open arms when its spoof qualities were first exhibited and still has problems to this day. The reason it seems to have these issues is because it: (1) lacks quality caliber actors and actresses (yes, it did have George Clooney and his bloody moment did come off rather well, and Marcia Brady was a bit odd to see here as well), (2) lacked an awe-striking budget, (3) sometimes hits a few plotholes has it trudges through various deaths, (4) it has a few laughs along the way. Still, the elements to something enjoyable all manifest themselves herein.Return to Horror High is a movie about someone making a movie about a massacre that took place years removed. In it, they decide to use the scene of the crime itself, people that had knowledge of what had transpired here in the past (including the school's principal, its janitor, and a local policeman), and some portions of truth in their otherwise horror-prone plot. Since its low budget they also want the actors to go that ""extra mile"" as well, having them pick up the extra slots left open by people ""quitting the film"" as well as staying on location day and night while its shot. Little do they realize that something is there working with them in the dark with them, something that obviously doesn't mind a sequel.Personally, I enjoyed this movie and I think that other people will enjoy it as well, given the fact that they understand exactly what they are watching. Be warned, however, that it is lacking in many respects and that you have to appreciate the qualities of a good laugh to really enjoy this.",Return to Horror High VHS

584096,"Nicholas Cage is usually good in anything he does and John Woo did a good job of directing. The war scenes are riveting and could not be done better. We see some introspective in five of the characters, Sgt. Enders, Yahzee, Sgt. Anderson, Charlie Whitehorse, and Chick. The rest are poorly developed. We hope to see the story of the Windtalkers but it is never truly developed completely. We see there is a Navaho code developed, and Tank is Turtle in that code. Then we see Cage told he must defend his code talker and the code itself above all. Most of the rest the movie is battle scenes but we periodically see a sprinkling of code talkers telling enemy coordinates to one another for support or shooting the breeze about what is happening in their company. Although very interesting it doesn't touch us emotionally like Private Ryan did. I think with a little more character development, especially the Indians, it would have been a great movie. When Yahzee gets mad at Sgt. Enders and runs around wildly killing Japanese without concern for those trying to protect him, it didn't endear me to him. I think if they had cast Wes Studi also, it would have been even better. This said this is still a movie worth owning. I certainly bought it on DVD.",N/A
705627,"Silence. Complete silence. As the film ended and the lights grew to a glow, the packed audience sat still and paid respectful homage as the fallen soldiers names appeared on the screen. Some around me could barely contain themselves as they shook and cried. Veterans and soldiers in military uniform humbly and quitly remained in their seats long after I left the room. It was amazing to see all of these strangers who had come together to see a movie, suddenly seem to be a part of something special and real. It reminded me of when I first saw Private Ryan a few years back, and saw the same reaction. People who had been arguing and behaving rudely before the movie, were now leaving proudly, holding the door open for the next person. It takes something special to do that. Like Blackhawk Down, We Were Soldier's comes at a time of heightened patriotism and valor. When life has a little more meaning, and when Americans dive deeper within themselves to find an extra emotion of strength to get through the day. What seperates We Were Soldiers from other great Vietnam films such as Platoon, was the effort to show both sides of the war. A Northern Vietnamese soldier, writing in his journal and staring at the photograph of his wife, as at the same time an American soldier is also dwelling on thought's of home. Before American's, The North Vietnamese army had fought the Chinese, and French...

701573,"Sean Penn, truly, has grown to become a splendid actor. His performance in this film is hugely affecting, very credible. Dakota Fanning (where on earth did they find this heavenly child?) is simply wonderful--achingly beautiful and scarily talented for such a young child. The drag on the film is the usually compelling Michelle Pfeiffer who phones this one in. She fails absolutely to inhabit the character of the driven lawyer who only takes on Sam's case in order to score points with her co-workers. For a woman as outrageously beautiful as Pfeiffer to deliver a (supposedly) gut-wrenching speech on her many flaws, she'd have had to bring a lot more to the table than she does. It's just not possible to buy her in this part (which is a pity, given her many other, wonderful performances--especially in The Fabulous Baker Boys). That said, Penn and the supporting cast carry this picture with such a depth of commitment that it's possible to ignore the fact that Pfeiffer is outperformed right off the screen. Yes, it's sentimental; yes, it's been done before. But not by Penn, who never fails to bring his all to each role he takes on. This is a feel-good movie with fine performances by Dianne Wiest, Laura Dern, Mary Steenburgen, and the rest of the cast.Recommended.",I am Sam

519937,"Visually, Peter Jackson's Fellowship of the Ring might be the most impressive film ever made.  Within the first ten minutes your jaw has dropped at least four or five times, and as the film progresses it never stops delivering the viewer sumptuous, imaginary worlds that feel real, even tangible.Unlike the new Star Wars trilogy, Jackson's new trilogy seems to  understand that audiences don't just need eye candy, but a combination of characters, plot, and effects that work as a whole to bring you somewhere you've never been before.  And if you have read the books (which I have not), it still probably can't prepare you for just how fully realized Jackson has made Tolkien's Middle Earth.  It is alternately ethereal, menacing, and best of all feasible.  It looks like a real place, and it looks like it has been actually lived in.  This sounds easy, but it's the failing of many sci-fi/fantasy films.  Most treat their sets as either museum spaces so pristine you'd think the characters were forbidden to cough, or as futuristic garbage dumps that couldn't house a rabid dog, much less an actual person.  Here, Middle Earth fascinates you, and you soon envision yourself in it.FOTR has been described as a foundation-laying first step in the trilogy, and in that sense it is a success.  Essentially a three hour chase after a ring that does some very, very nasty things, it picks up new characters as it goes along, and this is where the film has its major flaw.  While the characters played by Cate Blanchett, Sean Bean, and Liv Tyler may be readily identified by Tolkien readers, they remain elusive to the series' newcomers.  Those characters, and others, are barely introduced, much less fleshed out.  So the events involving them can be confusing and, at times, irrelevant.Of course, that leaves more room for the audience to become better acquainted with Elijah Wood's Frodo and Ian McKellen's Gandalf.  And that's where the movies succeeds the best.  The audience sees Middle Earth through Frodo's eyes, and as he travels the landscape, he conveys the same sense of wonder and fear that we go through as well.  It makes the battle for the Ring feel important, and not just like a plot device.  All of it feels real, and that's the ultimate compliment to any fantasy.But there's even more to behold.  CGI creatures that, at last, feel real and threatening.  A villain, dark lord Sauron, who looks like the personification of brute evil.  A truly astonishing fight sequence between McKellen's Gandalf and Christopher Lee's Saruman.  The ominous Ringwraiths.  And much more which is best unspoiled.DVD owners may want to wait the fall out.  November promises an extended, R-rated version of FOTR.  While the film already is much too frightening for children, adults might appreciate a few more gory details.  The extended version will also hopefully flesh out the more marginal characters in the Fellowship (and the pause button will allow weaker-willed viewers multiple bathroom breaks).  Because that would serve to improve what promises to be a film classic for many years to come, perhaps surpassing the original Star Wars trilogy as the ultimate cinematic fantasy.",The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring

388289,"The renowned and legendary director Roman Polanski, has hit a pinnacle of originality with this tragically funny, dark humored sex tale. ""Bitter Moon"" is a uniquely one of a kind outing that you can't compare to ANY other film.While on a cruise to put some sparks back into a troubled marriage, Nigel(Hugh Grant) and his wife Fiona, played by Kristen Scott Thomas (4 Weddings & a Funeral, also with Grant) meet Oscar (Peter Coyote) paralyzed from the waist down in a wheelchair, and his unexpectedly beautiful sexpot wife Mimi(Emanuelle Seigner).Oscar senses a voyueristic listener in Nigel after taking note of the obvious attraction he has for his wife.  Oscar invites Nigel to join him on board as he weaves the fairy tale start of how such an unlikely couple came to be.  While we listen and watch in flashback, Oscar spins tales of obsession at first sight, an affair of wild passionate lust, a turn to kinkiness followed by boredom, and last but far from least, a two-fold twist of power within the relationship that changes everything.Peter Coyote  plays his role as Oscar the narrator, in a wonderfully slimy and of course ""bitter"" way.  It's hard to decide if you hate him,  feel sorry for him, or a bit of both.  Hugh Grant is suitably uptight in the proper British stereotype, as Nigel.  While he claims to be thoroughly offended by Oscar's rantings,  his ""virgin"" ears keep begging for more of the same.  Kristin Scott Thomas plays Fiona, the proper English wife of Grant's Nigel.  Up until the ""bitter"" end, she is disgusted and suspicious that her husband is having an affair with Mimi, whom Nigel obviously finds to be a fascinating and mysterious creature indeed.  Apparently, he's not the only one, as you'll see. Oscar dangles her like bait, and Nigel is hooked.  As each intallment of Oscars story is told, Nigel becomes more and more desperate to uncover the mystery. Oscar relishes the sadistic hold he has on Nigels attention. He is like a drug dealer doling out doses of Mimi to an increasingly desperate imagination.Seigner, a distinctive beauty, who happens to be Polanski's wife, is almost unrecognizable from when she appeared in Polanski's ""Frantic.""  Compared to the skinny waif she'd been then, she is definitely and appropriately voluptuous here. A few extra pounds never looked so good, or worked so well. The role of Mimi calls for a total woman with femme fatale curves.  When you view this film for yourself, you will understand what I mean.One thing is for certain, with ""Bitter Moon"" you feel like YOU'VE been in Nigel's shoes along with him.  You will also relate to Nigel because this film will most likely shock, perhaps offend as well too, but like Nigel, you WILL keep coming back for more.",Bitter Moon VHS

705084,"I bought a bootleg copy of End of Evangelion a couple of months ago and read the English script online, so I am qualified to write this review.  To make the biggest clarification, episodes 25 & 26 are both about instrumentality yes, but absolutely DO NOT end in the same manner.  The outcome for Shinji is DRASTICALLY different, no spoilers.  To be honest, the series of Evangelion is the best thing I have ever seen.  It's shocking portrayal of humanity and incredible action scenes kept me riveted for months.  But, I could not stand episodes 25 & 26.  The psychological viewpoints Anno throws on us like the belief that others around us create the image that we call self make me croak.  While this may be true, Anno states that if no one else was around, our image of self would dissappear.  He also states that we can change our viewpoint on reality and just be happy if we change our perspective.  I'm sorry but this is all flawed theory.End of Evangelion, while maybe being Anno's hate letter to fans, is a much more enjoyable and CLEARLY THOUGHT OUT ending.  I bought Death & Rebirth just the other day and I must praise Manga highly for the care they gave my beloved series.  Who cares if French and Spanish aren't included, the original Japanese is what the series should be viewed in.  Even so, the English voice acting has improved, dare I say.  Even Tiffany Grant, the unbearable English voice of Asuka improved to listenable quality.  Still, the Japanese voices are far superior.Without giving away whole plot lines like some reviewers, let's just say you'll want to buy this DVD to see one particular EVA battle.  The animation is beautiful and some of the computer added effects are jaw dropping.  The only problems I have with the plot is that Anno uses real live video in one of Shinji's mind babbling scenes.  I hate when director's meld fantasy with reality.  I thought the way in which it was done was distasteful.Anyway, this movie will not give you closure.  In fact, if we set up a web-site and everybody wrote in how they wanted Eva to end, I bet every single person's response would be different.  I do consider this movie to be one of the greatest works in not just animation but in entertainment. I will accept this ending, but I wish it never would have ended :).",N/A

223037,"Originally dubbed the 'Slow Motion Picture' by even die hard Trekkies, the first Star Trek movie was a ponderous, plodding and protracted affair rushed into cinemas as a post-Star Wars special effects showcase. The plot was made even worse by the 1983 re-edit, which added 11 minutes to it's already interminable running time. Now director Robert Wise has re-edited the film, tightening the pace, re-inserted key scenes, enhancing effects and supervising a Dolby 5.1 sound mix. And the result? Well, it's still ponderous, plodding and only slightly less protracted. But there are good points though; the principal actors, (Especially William Shatner) are good in their roles, and Jerry Goldsmith's fantastic memorable score helps events, but it's still a so-so movie, that would thankfully be redeemed by the excellent Star Trek II. Not trying to push the point too far, but I fell asleep the first time I watched this lacklustre entry into the Star Trek cannon. The extra material on the DVD bumps up the rating though, with 3 retrospective documentaries with cast and crew interviews, trailers, 8 television commercials, 11 deleted scenes and additional scenes. Also included are storyboard archives and a new Star Trek series Enterprise promo spot.Impressive extras but it's for hard-core Star Trek fans only.",N/A

Sam's mother (Kristin Scott Thomas) is at her wits end with her drug using, angst ridden son and agrees to let him stay the summer with his father.

As most should know, that the jist of this movie is that Owen Wilson plays a navigator on a two-seat F/A-18 Super Hornet and he and his pilot are shot down on a Christmas photo-recon mission over Bosnia.  The missile evading scene is pretty intense.  You haven't seen jet manuevers like that since Top Gun.Now then the USS Carl Vinson gets the word that one of their planes have been shot down.  The problem is that the war is supposed to be over due to a peace treaty.  To send in a rescue mission and risk confrontation with the Serbs after the treaty would nullify the treaty and extend the war causing even more suffering.  So Gene Hackman's character is prohibited from launching a rescue mission.For those that have seen Hackman's 1988 film Bat*21, might recognize some similarities in how the Carrier tells Owen to move from place to place for pick-up that never comes.  (In Bat*21, Hackamn played a Colonel that was shot down in 'Nam in which he used an overlay of a golf course on the map in plotting his movements).One of the Serbs pursuing Wilson is a guy with an axe to grind.  He carries a high-powered sniper rifle, and we get scenes similar to Tom Berenger's 1993 film Sniper.  Wilson runs from him and gets shot at quite often.The film concludes on a high frozen mountain where one of the ejection seats landed.  Wilson uses this seat as bait to get the sniper guy out in the open.  Wilson suddenly jumps up out of a snow bank and they fight to the death with shades of a Rambo scene.  However, the whole Serb army comes rolling in with armor suport and a platoon or two of infantry.  However by his time, Hackman has 3 loaded gunship helicopters on the way and they provide close air support against the Serbs.  Very fun scene with cool visuals and sounds.This movie uses some very unique camera tricks.  There's several flashback scenes and they use reused footage, but from differnet angles and speeds.  It is very cool.The picture and sound on the DVD is extraordinary.  The picture is very clean and sharp with great blacks and shadow definiton.  The sound, while not as good as Super-Bit titles, is very well mixed.  In action scenes, the bullets whiz by your head and explosions shake it.This movie is a good showcase for Russian military equipment.  At first the F-18 is shot down by an Sa-13 Gopher SAM system.  The Serbs also have a couple of actual T-72s and several BMP-1s.  This movie was made with full cooperation with the US Navy including military supervisors.  So this movie is pretty much technically accurate.Yes, the plot is a bit thin, but how many different ways can you tell a pilot rescue and evade mission?",Behind Enemy Lines
236063,"There are a great number of people who have written reviews trashing Superman III. I realize that the film took a break from the usual story but why is that so terrible? Is it really a big deal that Superman III does not include Lex Luthor or much of Lois Lane for that matter? I thought this movie had a good bit of humor in it. Sure, Richard Pryor has probably had better roles but he did not do a bad job playing his character in Superman III. It was kind of neat seeing Clark Kent fight his opposite personality. The cyberwoman thing was not a big deal but it was somewhat interesting to watch that lady get turned into an outer cyborg of some sort. Come on people! Give Superman III one more chance. If you watch the movie for what it is and not compare it to the other Superman films, you won't be disappointed.",Superman 3 VHS

293724,This movie was a ton of fun.  The classic scene &quot;Bat Lady &amp; Fat Lady&quot; scene between Martin &amp; Lewis made the picture.  A very young (and quite attractive) Shirley MacLaine adds to the picture with a bit of wit.When I showed this picture to my son he couldn't stop watching it.  Whenever we go to the video store he asks to rent it.  I figure that there are a lot of clean movies out there like this one that kids would love if only we adults would expose them to em.  Of course for its time it shows quite a quantity of lovely ladies.My wife absolutely died over the scene when Jerry tries to get his back fixed.  This will definately be bought for my son's next birthday.  I suggest you don't wait that long.,N/A
515863,"The Esperanto of film narrative appears to be the (male) rites-of-passage.  From Vigo to Truffaut to Yang, from China to Iran to Hollywood, the story of a young boy rising to man's estate is in danger of becoming tediously over-familiar.  Although this is the first film produced by the former Soviet colony of Kyrgyzstan, there is nothing here to scare anyone who's seen 'Stand By Me' or 'George Washington'  - a group of pubescent boys mess about one long, hot summer, splashing about in mud pools, staring rapt at bathing matriarchs, thieving, fighting, going to the cinema, struggling with parents and societal expectations, watching older boys beginning romances.  Like a young Truffaut hero, the title character's attempts to fit in are fraught with obstacles, in particular the fact that he is a foundling orphan, which is crucially brought against him when he beats his best friend for the affections of an eternally-grinning young woman.Yes, we've seen it a thousand times.  What distinguishes a talented director from a hack is the fresh way he finds of enlivening stock material.  Aktan Abdykalyakov is luckier than most, in that his country has never been represented on screen, so this strange new world has an inherent, novel fascination of its own.  Abdykalyakov never allows the necessities of plot overwhelm his evocation of place, a rural village barely touched by modernisation.  Clothing, bicycles, cinema are among the few reminders of the 20th century, as we watch formal ceremonies celebrating birth and death, concentrate on people silently working, beating carpets, creating mud bricks, breaking in horses, gutting fish.  The soundtrack is never a mere backdrop, but has an intense ambient presence: the sounds of birds, insects, wind, trees, water, distant voices all creating a powerful character against which is offset the main narrative.But this world would risk being mere exotic colour if it wasn't for Abdykalyakov's very real skill as a film-maker.  He shoots his story mostly in monochrome, punctuated with odd shocks of colour, usually symbolic.  This can have a startling, epiphanic effect, such as the hushed, black-and-white open-air audience watching a colour Bollywood musical; or the Paradjanov-miniature in which a brightly-coloured kingfisher hits against a darkly-framed window.  Alternating static compositions with long sequence shots, Abdykalyakov achieves some extraordinary effects with light, whether it is a child playing with a mirror, or the otherworldly fade-outs accompanying threshold rituals.  The most amazing sequence in the film sees a young boys' fight in a snaking river played out and spent as the sun dazzles the splashing of water; as the combatants lurk off the frame, the camera stays on the river and the increasingly prominent natural sound, in a Renoir-like tableau of quiet dignity.",Beshkempir: The Adopted Son

704408,"The Rookie can probably be considered as one of the great baseball classics in the likes of Field of Dreams and Bull Durham.  Based on the true story of Jim Morris, this is a moving tale of a man who gets a second shot at a life long dream.  Husband and a father of three, Morris is a teacher at Big Lake, Texas, who was playing in the minor league until he hurt his shoulder.  Now he coaches the school's baseball team, and to inspire his players, he makes a deal with them.  If they are able to win the district title, Morris agrees to try out for the major league.Director John Lee Hancock took his time with the character development, and it pays off as he gives us a tiny glimpse of Morris' childhood, of how much the game of baseball means to him.  Dennis Quaid does an impressive job portraying Morris, I'd even say that he is totally perfect for the role, he is expressive, convincing and the acting just blows me away.  Rachel Griffiths is a good complement as Morris' wife Lorri, supportive and a woman with incredible inner toughness, I also enjoyed her performance.The Rookie is a great family film, and it's immensely entertaining, I highly recommend it even if you're not a sports fan.",The Rookie
341167,"As a film it is the best. Placido Domingo, by far my favorite tenor, sings an incredibly convincing Don Jose. Julia Migenes Johnson, nevertheless, does not sing a suitable Carmen. Raimondi and Esham are good in the supporting roles of Escamillo and Micaela. The movie was filmed on location in Spain, and the atmosphere, complete with large crowd scenes, gravel streets, cathedrals and a bullfight arena, makes a perfect setting. As a film this movie is exceptional. If you look closely, you will see how effectively Bizet's music is played to symbolic scenes. For example, the Overture is played in the first part of the film as we see Escamillo kill his first bull. Appropriately, the ominous Fate theme, which prophetizes the murder and death that is to come at the end of the opera, is played as a funeral procession carries a large idol of the Virgin Mary. Ironically, Carmen herself is in that scene, barely visible among the crowds. Faith Esham holding a Bible, strengthened by her love for Don Jose, sings the most beautiful version of ""Je Dis Que Rien"" amid a rocky, dangerous landscape of canyons, as she embarks upon a dangerous world of smugglers and duelists she is unfamiliar with, that has become the home of the roaming Carmen, Jose and the contrabandiers. The final scene, in which Carmen confronts Don Jose, making it clear that she does not love him and has turned her affection to Escamillo (the only portion Migenes Johnson sings incredibly well), behind the bullfight stadium. Appropriately enough, Don Jose stabs Carmen just as Escamillo has slayed his bull. It is a metaphor for the free-spirited Carmen herself, who is as untamed as a bull and slain by Don Jose, the one man who wanted to dominate her out of his obscessive love. Excellent film. A must see, if anything for the splendor of Placido Domingo's remarkable tenor voice. Five Stars Nevertheless.",N/A
594522,"Yeah this movie is terrible. This film relies completely on those slit second scare tactics. Where it's really quite one second and then there's a loud noise which usually turns out to be nothing. When there is something, such as a zombie, it's not scary. The zombies are very boring. They stumble slowly to their victims. They're so frail you'd think they could just be pushed over. Which is how it is in the 'Resident Evil' video game. Which is why this game never should have been made into a film. I do like the games but the plot just isn't strong enough for the big screen. If they want to make a scary game into a movie they should have chosen 'Silent Hill.' It's not so corny. Not all video game movies are completely stupid. 'Tomb Raider' managed to faithfully bring Lara Croft to the big screen and actually improve her image. Sorry Capcom, 'Street Fighter' failed and so did 'Resident Evil.'",N/A
165843,"Groundhog Day has a great deal of potential, but ultimately fails to live up to its promise. It isn't the concept that falls short; on the contrary, the plot is entertainingly original. Self-centred reporter Phil Connors aims to leave Pennsylvanian backwater Punxsutawney as soon as possible after completing a story on the annual Groundhog Day Festival, but his plans are thwarted when he wakes the following morning and discovers that it's Groundhog Day again. . . . . . . . . . and again. . . . . . . . . . Initially he sees this turn of events as akin to a nightmare, but soon realises that if there's no tomorrow, there are no hangovers and no consequences. . . . . . . . . .A storyline like this is very amusing per se, and there are some deft touches - such as Phil's audacious money-van heist, which succeeds simply because after innumerable Groundhog Days in succession, he knows Punxsutawney's routines so well. Due to the inherent comedy, Bill Murray's wisecracking attempts as Phil are unnecessary, they don't fit well with his character, and frankly someone making a face like a groundhog isn't that funny the first time, let alone meriting repetition.Although this is a comedy there are some genuinely thought-provoking issues raised - Phil learns (and through him we realise) that spontaneity can never be choreographed, and an impulsive moment's beauty lies in the fact that it 'just happens'. The film's biggest downfall is its predictability. Despite the various entertaining shenanigans en route, we just know that in the end Phil will have learned some Valuable Lessons and become a Nice Guy.Overall though, Groundhog Day is a likeable movie, and would leave the viewer with a much greater sense of satisfaction had it - instead of showing the happy couple running hand-in-hand through the freshly fallen snow - used a less trite finale.",N/A

213300,"This is sometimes seen as a typical 1980s film, making the name of Tom Cruise and featuring typically 1980s themes. Military men (compare with the dozens of Vietnam films) in smart white uniforms (An Officer And A Gentleman) fall for women with bad hairstyles. But this is really a film out of time. There is apparently a war going on with an un-named country (the implication is that it is the USSR), and this war is necessary to give any credibility to the dangers these top flyers face. This film feels as though it should have been set in 1943, with war-time themes of pilots on leave, garrison towns, and the 'first of the few' spirit suffusing the whole thing. Having set the story in the 1980s, however, the flying scenes are all handled skilfully and effectively, my only criticism being that it is difficult to see what is going on sometimes, especially with the stars' faces hidden behind flight helmets. One thing that is particularly 1980s, however is the soundtrack. Giorgio Moroder rarely puts a foot wrong, and some of his best work is on show here in the Oscar-winning Take My Breath Away.Anthony Edwards gives a great performance but it's a pity he is in the shadow of Tom Cruise throughout as he deserves more. The two ladies in their lives are played by a young Meg Ryan and Kelly McGillis, both being believable in the roles they play. If I had one criticism, it would be that too much time is spent in the air with 'planes, whereas the real drama is on the ground between humans",N/A

Miss Skye was perfect for being a beauty but not too perfect physically to seem too unreal.  If there ever was an intriguing father-daughter encounter, you'd find it in this movie when Miss Skye told her dad (Mr. Mahoney) about her first sexual encounter.Just one question to Mr. Crowe: how would you envision the transformation of Lloyd and Diane's relationship, as they grow older in age and more developed in personality?  How the genuine love between these two withstands the test of time and changing environment/mindset?  It'd take a certain maturity from Diane to support and respect a 'slacker' like Lloyd who doesn't 'fit in' her path.  It'd take a great deal of courage for Lloyd to pursue what he believes (in kickboxing) and in the same time accepts Diane's intelligence and possible career success without loosing his own self-esteem.Makes you think, huh.......................",Say Anything VHS
595994,"'Minority Report' is one of those rare films you can watch and later say, ""I've never seen anything like it before.""  Spielberg has done it again.  He gave us an extraordinary future world in last year's 'A.I.'  Now Spielberg's vision combined with Philip K. Dick's short story give viewers a look at 2054 Washington, DC, and it's a look that's hard to forget.Tom Cruise plays John Anderton, a cop in the DC Precrime division.  Precrime is a DC pilot program that's ready to go nationwide as the story opens.  By using precrime methods, police can determine who is about to commit a murder and arrive on the scene in time to prevent the murder AND make an arrest.  Everything looks great for Precrime until the division falls under an investigation and Anderton is wanted for ""pre-murder.""  But he doesn't even know the person he's supposedly going to kill in 36 hours.'Minority Report' is literally like nothing we have seen before.  Spielberg has filmed nearly the entire story in muted grays and shadows, with nothing in sharp focus.

Spielberg shows us that while the future holds many technical advances and changes, the GAP and stores like it will be with us forever.  Oh well, you can't have a perfect future.'Minority Report' is an exciting, intriguing sf/mystery that pulls you in and makes you believe that when you step out of the theatre you'll be seeing all the innovations you just saw on the screen.

537068,"As Bruckheimer and Bay count the ticket receipts and collect their big cheque from Disney, we the audience are left in a haze of sheer disappointment; and to an extent, exploitation. Bruckheimer has the ability to take away the art of filmmaking. It is all about product placement, merchandising and sequels. We can witness the bomb's point of view shot in its full 2.35:1 cinematic quality (which is the only good four seconds in the entire movie).This film was terrible. Apart from being funny many times (intentionally and unintentionally) the emotional impact of the hundreds of people dying was almost non-existent. Bay, so concerned about cutting every 5 seconds and showing large American and Japanese flags (just in case we forget who is who), has little idea about exactly what he is trying to do. Bay, who wouldn't know how to register a heartbeat in his unbelievable stereotypes, had no emotion to attach to each bomb dropped and bullet shot. What the attack amounted to was all style and no substance. It was like a video game. Some of the plane battles were so cartoon-like it was as if you were watching 'Pearl Harbour: The New Playstation 2 game"". Granted that these effects are remarkable but we are barely given the chance to appreciate them as we cut to another shot every few seconds.And the love story, so contrived, so inexplicably trite, is arguably the most sickening thing about this film. Affleck and Hartnett are best friends. Aflleck meets and falls in love with Beckinsale but he has to go to England and show the English how to fight a war (the cheek of that!). That leaves Beckinsale alone with only Hartnett to look after her. I leave the rest up to you to figure out.Bruckheimer sure knows how to get good actors to deliver the clunky dialogue. You have Sizemore, Baldwin, Voight and a surprising Hollywood turn from Ewen Bremner. They perform well, and so too do the three leads. Affleck is brash and cocky. Hartnett is shy and charming. Beckinsale is sexy and, well, cries a lot. The three are gorgeous to look at and hold the screen strongly. Considering the quality of the dialogue a lot of credit has to be given to these young stars, whose onscreen charisma should never be taken for granted.It's all been done before though. The love story is there for the teenage girls. The action is there for, you guessed it, the men, and the ""credibility"" factor (Jon Voight) is there for the old people (simply put). Elder Americans are renowned for their patriotism so this film will attract the grey market, which summer movies rarely do.You can talk about the historical inaccuracies but I have come to accept that Hollywood is more concerned with changing history to fit their story as opposed to the other way round...Their answer to every incorrect detail is ""it's a movie.""

669969,"""Angel Eyes"" is an excellent character study that is not likely to have much mass appeal.  It requires a very patient viewer due to its deliberate pacing and subtle presentation.  The great majority of viewers want to be actively entertained when they go to the movies and this is not that sort of film.  Viewing this film is more like trying to navigate a ship through a fog.  You have to stay alert and try to figure things out as you go.The story by Gerald De Pego is well written, presenting two very flawed characters that spend the entire story struggling to overcome a considerable amount of emotional baggage.  I give director Luis Mandoki extremely high marks for his presentation.  Mandoki takes his time and unfolds the story gradually with great nuance.  He takes great care to make sure to avoid being obvious.  Despite the fact that it is readily apparent that Catch (James Caviezel) is the same man that Sharon (Jennifer Lopez) helped in the car wreck in the opening scene (no spoiler here, they almost spoon feed this to you on the movie jacket) everything else needs to be discovered.Mandoki artfully introduces characters in a consistently nebulous way.  When we meet a new character we are not exactly sure during the beginning of the scene to whom we are being introduced and why he or she is important.  It is as if we are overhearing a conversation between two people and we are trying to figure out how they know one another.  The viewer is forced to think (a risky concept with today's fast-food-cinema mentality).  Mandoki constantly supplies us with vague information, making us ask ourselves, ""Okay, how does this fit in.""  It makes the film much more intriguing.My only criticism of Mandoki is that he tries to do too much with Sharon's family relationships. He makes it a full blown subplot that bogs down an already convoluted tale, taking us away from the real story which is about Catch and Sharon.  The entire party scene after the renewal of vows is completely superfluous.  The scenes of Sharon and her partner having soul searching conversations should also have been cut.  Another annoying detail is that Sharon and Catch are constantly driving around wearing no seat belts, which seems to me to be terribly incongruous given that one is a cop and the other a serious auto accident victim.The acting is terrific.  This is the best performance I have seen to date by Jennifer Lopez.  This part tests her talent with its breadth and she delivers a full ranging performance. Sharon is an extremely complex character filled with self doubt, anger and misplaced aggression.  Lopez plays her flawlessly with a delicate combination of toughness and emotional vulnerability, which is a difficult balance to achieve.  Her love scenes are tender and sincere, and her banter with fellow cops is smart and feisty.I was impressed by James Caviezel's performance in ""Frequency"", but I enjoyed this role even better.  Catch is an enigmatic character drifting through a period of anomie.  There is a duality to him, defeated and despondent, yet with a hint of seemingly inconsistent strength that emerges occasionally from his listlessness.  Caviezel's performance appears uneven as we watch it, yet it is perfectly presented and fits the character completely once we learn the whole story about him.  It is a marvelous interpretation of a complicated and puzzling individual.This film is a wonderful character study that is likely to be grossly unappreciated for its intricacy and strong direction.  The character development is masterfully done and the acting is superlative.  I rated it an 8/10.  It is an intelligent and sensitive story for the refined viewer.",N/A

When you put in the video part, the line between music and movie starts to wear thin, and for this kind of music I'd mostly say that it's not a good thing.Another reason why I say 'watch it' in my title is that the principles of lust video is somewhat graphic.

451438,"Can you watch the movie without watching the TV show?  Yes, but a lot of the characters will not get much of an explanation, so you will find yourself trying to understand the important of what you see.  If you have never seen the TV show, then watching the movie will let you know what it is like.Mulder and Scully are two special agents fighting against a global conspiracy.  The conspirators are very powerful as you will see from the movie.  As in the series, the powers-that-be work to discredit Mulder, so he will not have the power to keep digging into their schemes.  They even ignore his efforts at one point by stating that ""he is only one man.""  Mulder is our Everyman who takes on the big concerns.As mentioned earlier, without being familiar with the characters of the show, you will not understand the significance of the characters in the movie.  Who are the Lone Gunmen?  They are here in the movie, but don't have much of a part.  Since it is not explained, you will have to watch the series to understand.  The same is true for the Smoking Man.Like the cases that Fox Mulder and Dana Scully are trying to unravel, this movie is giving you small clues to something much larger.  The movie answers some questions from the show, but it also opens up new ones.  The search for truth is never-ending.  All we know is that it is out there somewhere.I would recommend watching this movie if you are familiar with the characters and ideas from the TV series.",N/A

294795,"I remember having watched this film several times on cable when I was a kid. I couldn't remember much about the plot, but I did remember it had some of the best movie martial arts fight scenes I had ever seen. There were a couple of occasions when some of the neighborhood gang attempted to repeat the stunts we had seen. I mention this little anecdote because it pretty much sums up BIG TROUBLE IN LITTLE CHINA. The film itself doesn't make much sense (unless you know a lot about Chinese mysticism) and is really too complicated to discuss here, but it isn't necessary do so anyway.The movie is a comical action flick. It's sort of a parody of the typical American western, but set in ancient China. The film is remembered not for its story, but for its action. The fighting scenes I saw as a kid have remained with me and those same scenes have influenced lots of Hollywood filmmakers. If you think the action scenes in THE MATRIX and CROUCHING TIGER, HIDDEN DRAGON are original, think again. John Carpenter did those stunts first about fifteen years before.Kurt Russell is hilarious to watch as the truck-driving, John Wayne spoof, Jack Burton. He's so stupid and conceited that he's totally oblivious to all that's going around him. Of course, most of the movie is told from his perspective because just like Jack, when it comes to Eastern mysticism, most of us are totally clueless.Kim Cattrall, as Jack's love interest, Gracie Law, was never hotter than she was here. She's a smart, intelligent woman but her film career reached its zenith here and it's not too hard to figure out why.As previously mentioned the action is awesome and is what largely drives the movie. However, the characters are a lot of fun to watch too. Overall, a fun mind candy movie to stimulate the Eastern part of your brain.",N/A

Primal Fear may seem like something you've seen before, but the clever, highly intelligent, and twisting script makes the film soar to unexpected heights, and Edward Norton's breakout performace as murder suspect Aaron has to be seen to be believed (Norton would receive a Golden Globe and his first Oscar Nomination for Best Supporting Actor which Cuba Gooding Jr. ended up winning for Jerry Maguire).  Richard Gere has the starring role playing Norton's lawyer who seems to be the only one who believes Norton's innocence.

As the money has been spent they kill their former associate.One of the East European's is fascinated with film. He checks into hotel rooms as Frank Capra. He steels a video camera and films this and other murders the two commit.Both of them then work out a devilishly cunning plan. They will film more murders. They will then sell the film to a news outlet and use the money to finance an insanity defence. If they are found not guilty then they can cash in on book and movie deals.The makers have included in the DVD some alleged ""documentaries"" about the reality of such a scheme. In fact the major premise is drivel. It suggests that to be acquitted of a crime in the United States all one has to say is ""I'm insane"" and the authorities will apologise for the inconvenience and let you out. The reality is that ""insanity"" had a defined legal and professional meaning.However this film is not about reality. It is about propaganda. It consistently shows police as heroic enforcers of all that is decent in the community rather than giving a real picture. Some police are heroic, some police are heroic some of the time. Some are lazy some are corrupt, some are decent but make occasional mistakes. This film is not concerned with how things are but shows police under sieges from a system which makes it easy for ""criminals"" to win.In much the same way the portrayal of the News Media is similarly a caricature.  It shows a News Reader who has been friendly with one of the major characters jumping out of his skin to buy a video of his torture and murder. Lastly the villains in the film come from the land of fantasy as well. The sorts of villains who have no relation to reality and are designed purely as emotional levers.Apart from the ideological problems with the film it is a limp thriller.

356455,"""The Rains Came"" really is a stupendous effort by Twentieth Century Fox and is a film to be proud of as far as sets, design, writing, effects,, and costumning are concerned. It has always been one of my favourite Tyrone Power films and it contains the one and only screen collaboration of Tyrone Power and Myrna Loy.I think in every department the film is stunning. The entire Indian city built on the Fox back lot (no [bad] computer generated special effects here!!!) is amazing and the stunning effects of the earthquake and flood quite rightly won the 1939 Academy Award for best special effects (no mean effort that year considering the number of classic turned out that year!!)The performances are also of great interest. Unlike past reviewers I think they are excellent. Myrna Loy putting aside her perfect wife persona gives a great performance as the spoilt socialite bored with life in general who falls head over heels for tyrone Power's Indian doctor. Nigel Bruce as Myrna's husband is the real surprise of the film performing totally against type as a character who is  arrogant, selfish and down right vicious who in the end gets his just desserts. George Brent normally so stiff on screen also delivers a strong heart felt performance which shows what he was capable of given good direction and a good story to work with. Finally there has been much talk of Tyrone Power playing an Indian doctor in the story. Frankly I think he is perfect in the role and not only looks stunning but is spot on in his characterisation of the young dedicated doctor torn between his duty and his growing love for Loy.A grand time is assured watching this great classic and I find I get something new from it with each screening. It's a great example of what Hollwood was capable of at its peek, enjoy!!",The Rains Came VHS

Personally, I wouldn't care how pure or unpure she was, because the whole royal court is portrayed here as a veritable saturnalia complete with debauched cardinals and studly men who [hire] themselves out to old ladies.If they had made this more of a black comedy I think it would have been a bit better of a plot.  Besides that, the settings, costume, and music make this movie.  Hillary Swank is good, but her character was supposed to be this great woman fighting for her family name when really she was more ambitious and jealous than anything else.  Christopher Walken is outstanding as the cardinal's prophet, though.I wish I could actually give this 3.5 stars.  Definitely worth watching in the theater, or renting on DVD.&lt;",N/A
228303,"Traditionally labelled as Action, this movie is more about suspense, as we spend a lot of time in the jungle with seven commandos who are trying to figure out exactly what it is out there that's trying to kill them, giving it an air of seriousness not often found in Schwarzenegger's films (the original Conan and Terminator films being the only other exceptions).  For this, let us give thanks to director McTiernan, who, on his first studio film, takes plot, characters, and visuals to a nice plateau.  The fear and suspense are genuinely felt, and, for once at least, the corny one liners (""STEECK around!"") seem gladly out place.  Helping this process along is the score by Alan Silvestri, which, at times, also conveys a heartfult sense of loss at the death of a comrade.  Of course, it's not with out it's ""giggle-snort-chuckle"" moments, when, for example, old buddies Arnold and Weathers first see each other, their handshake becomes a protracted not-so-subliminal advertisement for steroids (""What's the matter Dillon?

265354,"""Return of the Jedi"" is as good as any of the ""Star Wars"" films, and is perhaps the most moving one. Of course the film is packed with the usual action, as well as the humor that made the first three films so charming and which is sometimes lacking in the more recent efforts. This one has a big job to perform, tying up all the strands of plot and giving us the climactic confrontation between Luke Skywalker and the forces of the dark side. It succeeds well - there is some real drama and emotion to these scenes, exceeding that of the usual science fiction fare. (Maybe it's a bit corny, but it works.) I am also very fond of the early scenes of the movie, which take place at the lair of Jabba the Hutt, a fat blob who runs a den of sin that is hugely amusing. Some fans may grow tired of the cutesy Ewoks later in the film, little teddy bear things that probably rank just above Jar Jar Binks in the saga's popularity. However, the Ewoks are crucial to the plot - indeed, without them, the rebel mission would be a failure. Their simple-hearted efforts are able to overcome the sinister advanced technologies that are pitted against them, and this message is actually rather inspiring. Overall this is a very entertaining film, and a memorable one.","Star Wars - Episode VI, Return of the Jedi VHS"
679924,"Queer As Folk - The Complete First Season - Collector's Edition DVD Boxed Set.A Showtime Original Series.This is an excellent original series featured on an outstanding DVD collection.I'll give you my condensed version: I enjoyed it a great deal. The acting is good, the stories are engaging and the characters seem real. I'm recommending it without reservation.First, the packaging of this set is top of the line. The six-disc collection is a double-sided fold-in design.  Each disc is colored with one of the rainbow pride colors-a very nice, and unexpected, touch. Also featured with this box set-a nice little rainbow pride disc place marker-it's a six-colored rainbow ribbon.Before I get into my opinions, let me say that the discs themselves, quality wise, are outstanding. I watched every last minute of the six disc set, including the special episode editions and bonus material and had flawless picture and sound throughout.Yes, I did enjoy the series.I had never seen a single scene of Queer As Folk (QAF) before I got this DVD. That's not to say I hadn't heard about it, because I had. I've read a great deal about it: the sex, the drugs, the language, the lesbian bashing, etc.What I found, upon watching it myself, was that I liked the stories and I liked the characters.It's always difficult to forget what you've read when approaching a television series like this but I did my best to just approach it with my own personal life experiences as a guide.To address the mini-points mentioned above:There's sex and a whole lot of it. Much of it anonymous and much of it graphic. All of it gay/lesbian. Was I offended? No, not at all. As a matter of fact, the shear volume of sex actually makes it less shocking. The sex depicted in the series is not there to titillate (though it probably does); it's there simply as part of a story, part of the lives of these characters. Having watched the discs in long multi-hour blocks, it actually became a little numbing, though not to say uninteresting.There's drugs and a lot of them. They're taken frequently and unapologetically. Again, they're presented as part of the story. Was I offended? Not at all.  They're not preachy about what they're presenting and not every character takes illicit drugs.""the language""-Actually this is where I get a little prudish (surprised it's with the language and not the sex?) because the mouths on these folks are trashy. I thought all the foul language was a little over the top.""the lesbian-bashing""-A little explanation here. Quite a bit of press has been dedicated to the idea that the lesbian couple in the series is verbally derided and ""bashed"" by the gay male characters. I was a little worried about this, being a lesbian myself. I was a little weary of it because after one episode, I was really enjoying the series and didn't want to get offended as things went on. I found though, that I was more than 10 hours into the series when I realized that I hadn't been offended yet, not in the least. There's some name-calling, some use of words I'm not particularly thrilled with, but much of the name calling, was done in jest. I didn't find it offensive or at all ""mean spirited"" and I was looking for it. The one time a particularly graphic word is used in a negative and angry way, it is used by one of the lesbian characters.The writer's have done a wonderful job with giving these characters expansive and full lives. These episodes deal with issues and problems:age of consent (by ignoring it), drug use (by using them), safe sex (by having it), lesbian moms (by portraying it), conversion groups (by lampooning them), school outings (by portraying them realistically), hate (by living through it), family dedication and confusion (by showing the impact of being yourself), excessive drug use (by showing the consequences).I defy you to name another series which tackles these issues. It does not feel forced; these are issues that these characters deal with.One complaint I've heard is that the ""girls"" have so little screen time. I'll remind everyone that there is a five man to two woman ratio so it's reasonable that the guys will be on screen more often. I'm just thrilled to have a lesbian couple featured at all. The fact that we get so much from them, with so little screen time, is a great indication of the fine writing and acting that we see here. For those wondering-we do get one sex scene between Melanie and Lindsay-its in episode 9.Quick comment on the season finale- This is the most amazing episode. It is incredibly moving and romantic and terrifying. I don't want to give away too much, but it was well written and well acted. You will be moved.On the believability scale-I'd give this series an ""A.The discs-some information on the discs themselves and they way they are set up.Each disc contains 3 or 4 episodes. On each disc are six chapters you can use for scene access. Featured are each episodes ""next on"" promo-a feature which I liked a lot and which I was surprised to find.

669167,"Upon first impression ""Children of the living dead"" looks like it has been produced by a couple of children who managed to convince their neighbours and friends to star in an unofficial sequel to the ""living dead"" series. However after a few moments have passed (and very slowly I might add) sudden realisation dawns that this is far worse than any living children could produce and eventually you're convinced that this must have been produced by people as brainless and primitive as the living dead themselves. Initially the script seemed to show some merit and I was beginning to feel it was just marred by the talentless people involved however it soon tops the list as one of the films major faults. On the acting front it is devoid of any memorable performances and even poor Tom Savini appears to have realised just how bad this production was and decided to just phone his performance in. The editing is choppy and atrocious and the word continuity seems to be missing from the directors vocabulary. Alan Howarth's score (a former collaborator with John Carpenter) soon becomes tedious and after a while you can tell he either bailed from producing fresh music for the project or they just couldn't afford him any more when his score from Halloween 4 & 5 appears throughout the last half of the movie. The only saving grace is the special Make-up f/x which although not always great (the lead zombie Abbot Hayes looks like an over-exaggerated scoobie Doo zombie) at the majority of times remind you of the excellent Zombies that Tom Savini created for ""DAWN"" and ""DAY"". On that note The producers of the original Living Dead series should be ashamed that this inbreed of the excellent originals (including the 1990 remake) should ever have been released in the first place and upon viewing the credits it appears that the producer Joseph Wolf has used the ""living dead"" name in shame as an outlet for his daughter Karen Lee Wolf to produce such uninspired drivel...some people have more money than sense and I probably should include myself in that statement for wasting mine on this thrash, although it did make me laugh out loud more than once;) If you're looking for a more modern, clever take, well acted and original spin-off on the Zombie and Living dead genre, my advice is to check out the special DVD release for ""The dead hate the living"" which in my opinion, for a low budget shocker, definitely set my taste buds on fire.",N/A
722073,"The third season of Buffy was the pinnacle of the show's achievement.Buffy has to regain her sense of mission and her shattered psyche, after being forced to dispatch the one great love of her life to hell - and then to reintegrate him into her and her friends' lives, upon his eventual return. In the wake of previous events, another Slayer has been activated and come to Sunnydale: Faith, who is altogether mad, bad, and dangerous to know. In due course, Faith grows from Buffy's adversarial colleague to her friend, and finally to jealous betrayer, selling Buffy and everyone she knows out to their worst enemy, Richard Wilkins III, demon Mayor of Sunnydale.Though everything about this season is superior, its true highlight is the best pair of villains the series ever produced: Faith and the Mayor, played beautifully - and with an oddly touching personal chemistry - by Eliza Dushku and Harry Groener. The Mayor is a middle-aged murderer nerd, gleefully ordering his hench-vampires to kill civilians, while in the same breath reminding them, ""And boys? No swearing."" And Faith is a genuinely sad and tragic figure, though none the less evil for all that. The diabolical duo are not unlike a lethal Lolita and her horrific Humbert Humbert, a sort of surrogate father-daughter psychotic folie-a-deux.All the episodes of this season are very good, and the all-time best episode of the series - and its sequel - are among them: ""The Wish,"" in which debuting Anya the Vengeance Demon grants Cordelia Chase a Sunnydale into which Buffy Summers never arrived, demonstrating exactly how much one person really can make a difference, and ""Doppelgangland,"" in which a diabolical double of Willow - a really wicked, and morbidly humorous, vampire - is brought from Cordelia/Anya's wish-world into real-life Sunnydale, to wreak havoc.This entire season is, beyond question, Buffy at her best.",Buffy the Vampire Slayer - The Complete Third Season

There is little evidence to support this interpretation of the events that took place on Hearst's yacht that weekend, and plenty to contradict it -- e.g. the fact that Hearst and Chaplin remained friends for years afterward. And, while Kirsten Dunst is fun to watch, she's way to young to play the part of Marion Davies at that time.  Also, too much of the dialog seems ""scripted"" -- like people reciting clever lines, rather than like real conversations.Nice sets and costumes save the movie from being a complete waste of time, but unless you're a big Kirsten Dunst fan, you'll do better watching something else!",N/A
7331,"The most obvious way to read MA VIE EN ROSE is as the tale of difficulties faces by a very young boy who is very likely transgendered--but given the multilayered nature of the film this is actually a rather narrow point of view.  It would be more accurate to describe the film as a rather sly assault on a cookie-cutter society that reacts with a herd mentality toward anything in the least unusual.  And Ludovic Fabre is a most unusual child: barely into school, he has become convinced that he is really a girl, and in his childhood innocence he sees absolutely nothing socially amiss with the idea.The film begins with a party at which neighbors gather to welcome the newly arrived Fabre family--only to be, along with the family, extremely disconcerted when Ludovic makes an entrance in meticulously applied make-up and a pink dress.  His family passes the incident off as a joke, but Ludovic proves remarkably single-minded, and when he draws a neighborhood child into his fantasies he also incurs neighborhood hysteria.  The result is at once comic and unpleasantly vicious as his classmates, his neighbors, and eventually his family gradually turn upon him.Although there are one or two problems with character development in the script, the cast--particularly Georges du Fresne as Ludovic and Helene Vincent as free-spirit grandmother Elizabeth--is superlative, and director Alain Berliner balances the serio-comic story with a very light touch.  Viewers will laugh a little, cry a little, and ultimately come away from the film feeling an uncertain hope.  The fact that this film is rated &quot;R&quot; is merely so much more evidence of the power of the herd to dictate standards of normalicy--one or two profanities aside, there is absolutely nothing in the film to offend any intelligent viewer, and the film will hold a special appeal for older children who have been targeted as in any way different by their peers... and for the many adults who remember what it was like to be a victim of a society that prizes conformity over imagination, creativity, honesty, integrity, and self-awareness.  Strongly recommended.",N/A
385812,"What went wrong? I was so looking forward to this Dvd release, and when I finally played it, my heart almost stopped from the pain and agony. I thought to myself that finally someone would give this monumental musical comedy film the respect that it deserves. Boy, was I wrong. Now, there are some good points about this version, but there are only a few. First, the widescreen transfer is excellent and very clear and not as dark as the first Dvd version on MPI. Second there are some good extra features such as the original script that can be viewed with the film (as long as you have a DVD rom with your computer). There are so many extras that come with the film that it does get a little monotonous. Interviews with some of the cast, documentaries etc. Now for the drawbacks. The first and most important is the terrible audio. The 5.1 audio is a joke. There is absolutely no discrete signal separation whatsoever. You dont even get the option of choosing the orignal mono soundtrack or the excellent stereo sound that was included with the first DVD release. I had purchased the Yellow Submarine DVD last year and couldnt believe the excellent 5.1 surround sound on that, so I was under the impression that I would be lifted to the highest high (especially with such a highly regarded company like Miramax) when I would hear the begining crash of the title track. Every song on the Dvd sounds like they were recorded in a box. Maybe I should have waited a little while, but these things happen I guess. Hopefully this audio problem will be corrected in the future and it will wind up being a satisfactory version. I also would have like to have a suvenier booklet included since this is supposed to be a collectors edition. No dice. Also one of the biggest  disapointments is NO Paul Mccartney or Ringo Starr interviews. They could have provided alot more stories that probubly havent been told before about the making of the film. Altogether a great letdown. Yeah Yeah Yeah?  NO NO NO!!!",N/A

There were some very big shoes to fill when Phantom was released and for the most part, people felt like there was something missing. As this movie ages however, I feel that it will begin to grow into those shoes.Set many years before the first trilogy, Phantom Menace introduces the viewer to many new characters along with introducing us to younger versions of some of the classics such as C-3P0 and Obi Wan. The story becomes very interesting once the viewer sees the movie for a second time, after the initial shock has set in and settled down. The movie does a nice job of setting the groundwork for the next two and begins to answer some of the questions about Darth Vader's past. There are dazzling special effects, a very intelligent storyline and great action sequences. The light saber battles are incredible and leave even the most disgruntled viewer feeling pleased.Most people would rather complain about something instead of enjoy it, eventually people will forget about their petty quarrels with the movie and settle down to enjoy the movie as well as the other two prequels.

139984,"'Blue Velvet' is a Douglas Sirk melodrama recast as a Surrealist film noir.  I had thought that the film might have dated, that David Lynch's bugs-beneath-the-smiling-small-town-facade worldview had long since passed into self-parody, but Lynch was never much interested in social criticism.  What may be fascistic violence, misogyny and abuse of physical vulnerability in the film's surface crime narrative becomes liberating when seen in its true dream colours, as elements of the hero's unconscious.  The film begins with the hero's father, connected to candy-coloured images of suburban, robotic conformity, suffering from a stroke.  Freed from this paternal authority, Jeffrey begins exploring the dreamscape of his own desires, falling for women under male control (trying to assert Oedipal primacy), testing various kinds of sexual experience, facing a world of metamorphosing identities and locations.  This only remains possible so long as his father is in a coma - once he resumes control, the deviant can be suppressed, and automated complacency restored.'Velvet' is a frightening but hilarious black comedy - from the dog gulping hose water over a stroke victim (a different - or related? - kind of unconscious) to earnest medical discussions about a severed ear to Dennis Hopper's pre-camp violence to Isabella Rossellini's 'Bride of Frankenstein' strapping to an ambulance stretcher.  Andre Breton once defined black humour as the key Surrealist characteristic, and 'Velvet' is, after 'Vertigo', the greatest Surrealist film of the American cinema, from its interior spaces evoking the paintings of de Chirico and Magritte, and the dream-imagery of corridors, stairs and doors (as portals to another world; as embodiments of (female) sexuality, especially Dorothy's bathroom and her urethral nightclub stage) to the dream-logic of the plot, with its emphasis on the nocturnal; on unconscious walking; on repetition; on the fetishised focus on items of clothing, lips, colours etc.; on the existence of various worlds in a circumscribed space, like the conflicting desires in our mind.'Velvet' is Lynch's most successful film because it is structured by genre.  At one point Sandy asks Jeffrey whether he is a detective or a pervert; both types are defined as voyeurs.  Jeffrey belongs to the great tradition of anti-detectives headed by 'Vertigo''s Scottie Ferguson, men who believe they are solving a crime in the external world, but are really getting lost in their own mind.  The detective might seem to be the 'reality principle' opposed to the liberation of Surrealism, but there are points in common - the interpretation of visual clues, the search for an elusive ojbect, the playing with time and space.  Ultimately, however, the restitution of order must mean death to Dream and Desire.What makes 'Velvet' more successful than most Surrealist films is character - although Frank (surely an outcast from Celine, or the Wizard in this twisted return to Oz?) and the rest are figments of Jeffrey's unconscious, they are fully-formed and compelling in their own right.  Lynch's visuals are so unforgettable and potent, it is easy to overlook the unnerving genius of his sound-designs, the hyper-reality of 'real' or background sound, the menacing atmospherics and Hollywood pastiche in Badalamenti's score or the brilliantly destabilising use of familiar pop standards.  'Velvet' was the first 'serious' film I ever saw - looking back at it over a decade later, I hadn't realised how much it had infiltrated my own unconscious and private mythology.",N/A

245333,"Richard Burton's brooding performance coupled with appropriately grim black and white photography from cameraman Oswald Morris provide just the proper mood as the masterpiece thriller from former British intelligence operative John Le Carre was brought to the screen in 1965 with capable fidelity.While a British production, the film's director was American Martin Ritt, an accomplished master of providing films of compelling seriousness with a touch of the grim, as exemplified by &quot;No Down Payment&quot;, &quot;Hud&quot; and &quot;The Front.&quot;  Burton plays an intelligence operative gone to seed, hence the reference to &quot;coming out of the cold&quot; which, in spy talk, involves being taken out of the field of operation.  Burton goes to planned seed, becoming an alcoholic who ultimately is thrown into prison for pummeling a thoroughly decent London grocer who had extended him credit and ultimately had to draw the line, incurring Burton's well orchestrated rage in accordance with plans from MI5.As soon as Burton leaves prison Michael Hordern is waiting for him.  They discuss &quot;doing articles,&quot; a cover for what is really expected, turning allegiance and going to work for the Soviets.  During this period Burton is provided with a job at a small library featuring psychic works.  It is here that he meets Claire Bloom, an ideologue who attends local Communist study groups as a way of making a difference in a troubled world.Burton operates in a realm of barely contained rage.  He inveighs Hordern with scorn and is not about to disagree with Oskar Werner when the East Germany Communist ideologue refers to Burton and his ilk as &quot;the lowest currency of the Cold War.&quot;Burton's contempt for his role in a grimy affair is enhanced by the fact that he has been sent to East Germany to clear Peter Van Eyck of charges that he is a double agent working for Britain.  Werner has shrewdly pegged him, and British intelligence does all it can to help a ruthless individual it took charge of after he murdered a man on a trip to England during an East German traveling trade exhibit.  Eventually Bloom surfaces as a prop to assist the contemptible Van Eyck.More twists and turns occur until ultimately Burton wonders just what the future holds for him, and whether Bloom, the only person he cares for in life, will be part of it.  Circumstances ultimately answer important questions for Burton as he is propelled through a swirl of events masterminded by wily intelligence operatives to his ultimate destiny.This is a spectacularly moody giant of a film.  Guy Troper and Paul Rehn fashioned a brilliant script which meshes with Le Carre's chilling suspense masterpiece.  &quot;Spy&quot; was a deserving recipient of a Best Film British Academy Award.  It bristles with controlled rage and sizzling wit delivered with the proper measure of acid by Burton in one of his enduring roles.",The Spy Who Came in From the Cold VHS

34562,"SWING TIME tells the story of John 'Lucky' Garnett (Fred Astaire), a brilliant dancer by profession, a truly fortunate gambler by instinct. When his marriage plans to Margaret Watson (Betty Furness) are temporarily foiled, he hops a train to New York with his sidekick Pop Everett (Victor Moore), hoping to earn enough money to satisfy his future father-in-law. What he finds there, however, is inevitably true love with Penny Carroll (Ginger Rogers), a sweetheart of a dance instructress who falls quickly for Lucky's charm and fast feet. Although Lucky feels guilty about his fiancee back home, he finds it difficult to deny his growing attraction to Penny.It isn't really difficult to figure out how the story ends--it wouldn't be a Astaire/Rogers romantic-comedy-slash-musical if Lucky and Penny didn't end up together. But what makes this stand apart from TOP HAT, and in fact stand *proud* while doing so, is how that inevitable love story is told simply and effectively, and most importantly, in a credible fashion. While watching TOP HAT, I was too busy holding my breath at the sheer technical finesse involved in the dance sequences to really care that neither the characters nor their relationship with each other was very well-developed. Plot? What plot? It just really did not seem to matter with that film; what mattered was that we were treated to a gorgeously-choreographed song/dance sequence practically every other minute. (Which still does not make it a bad film, just a slightly uneven one that relies on the charm of its leads to succeed.)SWING TIME certainly has its own faults, most notably repeating the reaction Ginger Rogers's character has to a perceived wrinkle in her relationship with the Astaire character--that is, impulsively marrying (or nearly marrying) the nearest person who happens to be male and who has a crush on her. The ending, especially Ricky Romero's response to Penny's decision between himself and Lucky, really makes one wonder whether the screenwriter for the film decided to clock out early when writing the last few minutes. But this is no less a problem in TOP HAT; for some reason, Rogers's character in both films always winds up nearly-married to someone other than Astaire, and the film must then take the time to regain the ground that has been lost through this 'plot twist'. (For me, this is almost salvaged in SWING TIME when Lucky and Penny finally serenade each other with a delightful blend of two of the best songs featured in the film, 'A Fine Romance' and 'The Way You Look Tonight'.)This minor flaw aside, SWING TIME itself is delightful--it's much more a romantic comedy than it is a musical, whereas I think this is reversed with TOP HAT. You can't help but warm to the relationship between Penny and Lucky, particularly when she complains about the state of their 'Fine Romance'--decidely one of my favourite songs in the film (tough competition, considering the fabulous Jerome Kern score!), and a lovely touch that it is actually Rogers's character doing the pursuing for once. This number, sung amidst whirling snow, recalls my favourite song in TOP HAT, in which Jerry is asking Dale, 'Isn't This A Lovely Day?' while they're caught in a storm. The musical numbers are not compromised, however--the dance Astaire and Rogers perform to 'Pick Yourself Up' is fantastic, as is what appears to be their last dance together when Lucky tells Penny that he's 'Never Gonna Dance' without her again. As with Astaire's black-face solo in 'Bojangles...', the dance sequences are truly amazing to watch, but happily, not the focus of the entire film. In fact, they are somewhat more low-key and understated than those in TOP HAT--far less sweeping and dramatic dances, and more believable ones that fit perfectly with the story and the characters.SWING TIME is without a doubt one of the best movie musicals I've ever seen, and to date, my favourite Fred/Ginger film. It's one of those films that's almost a masterpiece without trying, and that's probably the best recommendation I could give it. Mandatory for Fred/Ginger fans, and for fans of the musical genre in general.",N/A

She builds up the intrigue very well, but she uses her charms, and her womanly reactions, like anger, sadness, naivete, tears, etc, with both will power and humor. She takes a man, not the first catch but the second catch, in her trap in no time. She is even in a way forced to marry this second catch by his own decision. Of course the plot has no depth but it shows too well the secondary position of women for these rich businessmen. Women are nothing but domestic facilities according to Shaw's term, but they are able to turn their dependence into some kind of tremendous power, especially since, in this good society, a man without a woman, or better a wife, is nothing, is a grotesque oddity. What's more Danielle Darrieux is a marvellous actress in this part.Dr Jacques COULARDEAU",N/A
14867,"NOTE: Review written March 1999I think that the writer stayed awake during a sociology class long enough to get the idea for Urban Legend. Apparently, some studio executive approved this project without reading the script, assuming he or she knows how to read.Urban legend is a term which is used in reference to modern myths. An example would be the Roswell UFO incident fifty years ago. A certain number of people will always believe that it happened, whether it did or it didn't.The movie Urban Legend uses other improbable common beliefs as the basis for a serial killer's method. This is an interesting premise, but, trust me, this is no Silence of the Lambs or Seven. It's not even a I Know What You Did Last Summer. It's part of a recent phenomenon in Hollywood called I Can Make a Dumber Movie Than You Can. It could also be used as an Encyclopedia of Movie Cliches.It begins with a female college student driving alone on a dark, rainy night. She passes a gas station. The camera shows a close-up of her SUV's gas gauge. Oh, no! It's on empty! She makes it back to the station. Oh, no! The attendant is a maniac! She manages to escape. A form raises out of the back seat. Oh, no! It raises an ax!We move on to the college. It's a small, quaint school, full of old brick buildings and big trees. It's miles from nowhere. It's students are pretty, and they are sharing a brain. The president is an idiot, the teachers are eccentric, the janitor is insane, and the lone security guard is earnest but incompetent. Does all of this sound familiar?The urban legend at the school is that several students were massacred twenty-five years ago, but this was covered up by the school's administration. [Don't ask. This is a horror movie.] Of course, we know that this is no legend. Soon people start dropping like flies. To most of the students, this is tragic because the 25th Anniversary Massacre Party is in danger of being canceled.I have to mention the excellent Scream and its sequel yet again, because they are among the movies which are so good and which do so well that they spawn countless imitators, which are rarely any good. These wind up making the genre unpopular after a few years. Down the road, another classic comes along, and the cycle begins again.Urban Legend did quite well at the boxoffice. Since such movies don't have big budgets, a sequel is likely. Based on their dreadful performances, those actors which were not killed off should be available to star in it. I, on the other hand will not be available to review it.NOTE: This is the first movie in history where a student, listening to music on head phones, drifts off to sleep while her dorm mate is being strangled to death ten feet away. As I said, these kids are sharing a brain. Come to think of it, so are the people who made this movie.",N/A
665747,"WIT is an uncompromising look at death by cancer - and the therapy designed to cure it.Emma Thompson is Vivian Bearing, a Doctor of Philosophy and an aloof professor of 17th century English poetry. Her special interest is the metaphysical verse of John Donne, to which she's dedicated her scholastic life at the expense of human relationships. Now, at 48, she's diagnosed with stage-four metastatic ovarian carcinoma. There is no stage five. Her oncologist, Dr. Kelekian (Christopher Lloyd), recommends an aggressive, 8-month regimen of treatment with an experimental drug - at full dose. Because of the expected onerous side effects, he challenges Vivian to show fortitude and perseverance, and, never a slacker, she promises a stiff upper lip.Much of the film is comprised of a series of monologs by Bearing as she addresses the camera, and the audience, with reflections generated by her dry WIT about the chemotherapy's appalling toll on her person and the process by which it is being exacted. At one point, after Kelekian and a train of acolytes visit Vivian in her hospital room, a medical teaching ritual known as Grand Rounds, she wryly observes that the exercise was:""... full of subservience, hierarchies, gratuitous displays, sublimated rivalries. I feel completely at home. It is just like a graduate seminar.""WIT is a pointed indictment of the generalized insensitivity of medical caregivers to the terminally-ill patient, who comes to represent little more than a specimen cup, a form covered with scribbled observations, or, at best, a career-enhancing article in a medical journal. Jason (Jonathan Woodward) plays the shallow, research-minded physician completing a clinical fellowship under Kelekian's direction. Bearing asks what his reaction is to patients who express apprehension or fright. His clueless response: ""Of whom?""As the course of Vivian's treatment - or is it torture? - draws to its conclusion, her only source of human warmth and sympathy becomes her primary care nurse, Susie (Audra McDonald), and her only pleasure the eating of a popsicle, the lone ""food"" tolerated by a GI tract ravaged by the anti-cancer drug.One of the most heart-wrenchingly poignant scenes ever put on celluloid has to be one near the conclusion when Vivian is visited by her aged mentor E.M. Ashford (Eileen Atkins). I'm not ashamed to say that my eyes teared.WIT isn't an easy film to watch. I suspect any person undergoing cancer therapy can relate to it, and should therefore be seen by anyone providing oncology care. Viewing WIT should be absolutely mandatory in every medical and nursing school in the country.This performance by Emma Thompson is an Oscar-caliber tour de force. It's a sad commentary on the film industry and the audiences it feeds that WIT's producers had to release it as an HBO movie rather than one for the Big Screen because it would have otherwise been steamrollered at the box office by the mindless thrillers that appeal to the masses.",Wit
534008,"The opening scene of Enemy At The Gates is very much reminiscent of (and heavily borrows from) the opening scene of Saving Private Ryan in its graphic depiction of the madness and brutality of war. However, that is no bad thing because to this point Saving Private Ryan is the most realistic cinematic depiction of war ever made. Set around the Nazi invasion of Russia, and more specifically the Battle of Stalingrad during World War II, this is the story of a reluctant hero Vassily Zaitzev (Jude Law), a sniper elevated to iconic status by a combination of his own deeds and political war propaganda. Vassily gives his people new hope and as a result, the Nazis view Vassily as a major threat to their conquest of Russia and send their own expert marksman Major Konig (Ed Harris) to Stalingrad to hunt down and kill Vassily, and so begins a game of cat and mouse.Director Jean-Jacques Annaud expertly recreates and captures the horrors of war and a city made desolate. The main cat and mouse plot between the two expert marksmen is also well-handled and Annaud maintains a good balance between the need for suspense, urgency and character development. Okay so what if it was only the Penal units of the NKVD that shot retreating soldiers and not the main part of the Red Army? (You say tomato I say tomatoe). It is a fact that under Stalin and subsequent communist Soviet regimes that people were unfairly imprisoned for such crimes as having a different opinion or writing a book and that Stalin committed horrific crimes against his people. Is it morally okay to shoot criminals and people who were unjustly jailed? I don't think so. It is also a fact that propaganda (on all sides) always plays an important part in war, and that the Russian soldiers in WWII fought incredibly hard and won against all odds, as depicted in this movie. However, this is not just a war movie or a thriller set in wartime, it also maintains a couple of good sub-plots, including a love triangle between Vassily, the propaganda journalist Danilov (Joseph Fiennes) who made him a hero and a female soldier played by Rachel Weisz. The casting of the movie is pretty interesting, with the exception of the excellent Ed Harris, the main characters are all played by British actors (with English accents), including a cameo from Bob Hoskins as Joseph Stalin. The reason behind this I don't know but they all give good performances, although I must admit to still being slightly unconvinced with Rachel Weisz's acting ability.While not quite hitting the heady heights of classic war movies such as Saving Private Ryan, Enemy At The Gates nonetheless gives a refreshingly alternative viewpoint and historical retelling of the second world war from what has often been a neglected Russian perspective: Differences aside and contrary to popular opinion, it is unlikely that the Allies would have won WWII so quickly if it were not for the doggedness and enormous sacrifices of the Russian people. This is definitely superior to most of the dross that gets released on a weekly basis and whilst not quite scaling the heights to greatness, it's a pretty good film that I highly recommend checking out.",Enemy At the Gates
413681,"There have been a vast number of versions of TREASURE ISLAND, and I am sure the future will bring a great many more, but this one remains the one to watch for one and one reason alone: Robert Newton. There have been many, many fine Long John Silver's, from Wallace Beery to Orson Welles to Jack Palance to Charlton Heston, but none of these others got anywhere near to the performance of Robert Newton. One of the great character actors of the forties and fifties, Newton isn't very well known in the United States because he did only limited work in Hollywood (even TREASURE ISLAND was filmed in England, not in the Caribbean or Hollywood). But fans of film will remember him in Sir Carol Reed's great film ODD MAN OUT (he plays an artist who wants to paint the dying visage of James Mason), in Coward and Lean's THIS HAPPY BREED, and an appropriately terrifying Bill Sikes in Lean's OLIVER TWIST. Newton was a glorious ham actor, in the best possible sense, and to watch him chew up scene after scene, always being over-the-top yet taking the part with complete seriousness. He is everything one can possible imagine in Long John Silver.To be honest, apart from Newton's utterly dominating performance, there isn't much reason to prefer this version TREASURE ISLAND to any other. Apart from his Long John, the film as a whole is solid if unspectacular. While we have seen perhaps the finest Long John Silver we are ever likely to see in Robert Newton (who was so glorious in the role that Disney did both a sequel film and a television series featuring his Long John), we have yet to see the definitive film version of Stevenson's tale. The book contains darker elements than have ever been brought to screen. The 1934 MGM version (with Wallace Beery as Silver and Jackie Cooper as Jim Hawkins) is highly sanitized family fare, though it is perhaps the version with the best overall cast. It would, however, be nice to see an adult version of the tale, with all the darkness and complexity left intact. But even after that film does appear, this film will be well worth going back to just to relish Robert Newton's incomparable performance.",Treasure Island Walt Disney Film Classics  The Fantastic Adventure Series  VHS
703477,"The bad news is that the DVD is hard to use and contains almost no extras.  It took me 8 minutes to figure out how to get the movie to play.  Zero bonus materials.  The good news is that this is an extremely interesting film to watch, very theatrical in its use of blackouts which gives the film the slow deliberate pacing and a sense of life-like gravity to the unfolding events.  I particularly was impressed with the visuals such as focusing on the curtains blowing in the hallway as you hear sounds of conversation happening off frame.  In another shot, you see Matt sitting down on the bed while the camera focuses on the mirror on the wall, almost like you are seeing the reflection of a couple in tragedy.  The visual power of the film repeatedly is emphasized over the dialogue.  In one scene, after the tragedy, Matt (the father) is working on the boat and the boy of the girlfriend comes to the top of the pier and looks down.  Both stare at each other, neither makes a motion of greeting, then the boy bicycles off.  It's a powerful scene, showing how the link between them has dissolved.  In another scene, Ruth (the mother) gets a posthumous letter from a sweepstakes touting that the Frank (the dead son) could be a winner.  We fully understood, in the absence of words.  The climax of the film is similarly understated and undercut, making it seem all the more realistic and lifelike.  The father tells Richard, ""Don't talk.""  As the film ends and the camera pulls back on the early morning scene of the little Maine town, we know that life will go on; and yet for some it will always be different than before.  This is certainly not a film for the action genre set, but it is a thoughtful and powerfully moving portrait of a family beset by the ultimate tragedy.",In the Bedroom
538201,"Along Came a Spider is Morgan Freeman's second appearance as forensic psychologist Alex Cross. The first was in 1997's Kiss the Girls. This is not a sequel. Cross is a character in a series of books by James Patterson. Like the books they are based on, the movies are thrillers. All thrillers are not created equally, and Along Came a Spider is inferior to its predecessor. Freeman is as good as ever. The movie is full of surprises, and there are indeed some intense moments. The problem is the script. Whenever the movie tries to explain a previous scene, that scene is more full of plot holes than the one it is trying to explain. Still, the movie can prove enjoyable as long as you park your thinking cap next to the popcorn.The movie starts with a wild police pursuit in which Cross' partner is killed. Devastated, Cross goes into seclusion, uncertain whether or not he will be able to work again. Meanwhile, in a posh private school in the District of Columbia, student Megan Rose [Mika Boorem] is kidnapped by a teacher, Gary Sonji [Michael Wincott]. Megan is the daughter of a United States senator. This means that Jezzie Flannigan [Monica Potter], the Secret Service agent assigned to protect the girl, is in a lot of trouble. Cross, drawn against his will into the case, takes her under his wing, and the two set out to find Megan. The road they follow is full of dangerous twists and turns.Besides Freeman and those suspenseful scenes, there are some good elements. I liked Megan, because she is a kid with guts. She is as much heroine as victim, using her wits as often as possible. Wincott makes a convincing villain, effectively utilizing his sinister good looks. The photography is atmospheric and gives the movie a properly creepy look.It's too bad all the good parts of the movie don't make up for the confused plot. It is Sonji who calls Cross after the kidnapping and taunts him into coming out of retirement, but why he does this is never adequately explained. Sonji kidnaps Megan to get to his real target, Megan's best friend at school who is the son of the President of Russia. Why in the world is this kid in an American school? Why didn't Sonji just kidnap him in the first place? These are the kinds of questions many viewers will ask while watching the movie. A thriller generally works through suspension of disbelief.

This is a fun film which helped start the Kung Fu craze in the pre-Bruce Lee period, and is quite entertaining despite its creatively dubbed dialog -- lots of outrageous martial arts stunts probably achieved by off-screen trampolines and in one case by running the film backward.  A great romp, spoiled by lackluster color and focus and a grainy, muddy tinge.  Not terrible, but very mediocre DVD technically speaking.  In this case, you get only what you pay for.",N/A

164905,"I know that a lot of people did not like this movie and that it recieved some harsh criticism. However, I felt like this was one of the funniest movies in a long time and still consider it hilarious. Jim Carey plays Chip Douglas, an unstable man that has been raised on television and currently works for a cable company. The dialogue and contrasting styles of Jim Carey and Matthew Broderick are great. Broderick wants to find love and success in his work, but finds that Carey wants to be buddies with him following a routine cable service.What makes this movie a winner in my mind is that it is a dark comedy aimed at showing how much television exploits the average American person's mind. Some of the funniest scenes are of Ben Stiller and his court case that appear on television, and the depiction of the average person's craving to follow a murder case. It is disturbing at times, but this is not a movie that takes itself too seriously.Finally, Carey plays his role as a cable guy to perfection, and some of the funniest parts of the movie are just his zany antics. For instance, he takes Broderick to see Medievel Times (it is obvious that Carey has been there many times) and they wind up having their names chosen as the two to perform a jousting competition to the many in attendance. I think it's a fun movie, but it is a movie that uses dark comedy to achieve its points.",N/A

For the second time Hope is teamed with the beautiful and talented Paulette Goddard (why oh why isn't &quot;The Cat and the Canary&quot; available on video??) and the two have a wonderful screen chemistry that works wonderfully in this movie.I wont relate the details of the plot but to say that the film involves gangsters, spooky haunted houses, corpses rising from the dead,zombies,  thunder storms etc. It is an engrossing comedy/thriller from start to finish. Bob Hope has never been better with his lovable coward characterisation and the memorable quips along the way will have you laughing till your stomach hurts.The overraul look of the film is lavish and intriguing. Paramount obviously spent a fortune on the production and it shows. The spooky house on Black Island that Paulette inherits is one of the best haunted house sets ever constructed. It combined with the fog, strange animal noises really gets the chills going.Willie Best, a fine negro actor has a major role as Hope's man servant and he is wonderful in his performance with his one liners generating alot of laughs and he matches Bob Hope all the way.&quot;The Ghost Breakers&quot; is a superb spook flick which I know you will really enjoy. The VHS copy I have is really pristine so it is definately worthwhile in adding this classic to your collection. I love the Bob Hope films of the 40's and this is one of the best. Now can someone release &quot;The Cat and the Canary&quot; onto video? I'd truly love to see this great comedy duo of Hope and Goddard in their other famous screen teaming.",N/A

699443,"Like most movies about real life events, this one is also worthless as history. The film tells the more sensational version of events theorized to have occurred aboard the famous sailing vessel, Mary Celeste, found in the middle of the Atlantic under full sail with no one aboard.Captain Briggs gathers a crew for the trip to England, but not before stealing his best friend's girl and marrying her. With a crew and his new wife aboard, the ship departs New York. Once out at sea, the cruelty of a seaman's life becomes obvious to the new bride, who quickly chooses to stay below deck most of the time. About half-way through the movie, the crew begins getting bumped off one by one, until the mystery of the Mary Celeste becomes legend.The original British film ran about 80 minutes, some of which was taken up with a courtroom inquiry into the mystery. Those parts are missing from this, the American version, and the footage is assumed to be lost. It was felt that American audiences in 1935 would either not understand or care about the inquiry angle, so these scenes were excised. Clocking in at 62 minutes, &quot;Phantom Ship&quot; seems somewhat strangely tedious despite the cuts. The dialogue and acting are remarkable only in their lifelessness and lack of believability.However, the movie is still worth a looksee by Lugosi fans. Lugosi offers us a dramatic performance rather than his usual horror genre type of character. He does an admirable job playing the broken shell of a man who lusts for revenge. His performance (especially towards the end of the film), really sells his act.Edmund Willard plays Toby Bilson, first mate of the ship. He comes off very well as the menacing bully of the deck, seemingly intent on crushing any element of joy the crew may have in their drab lives of toil. Of all the cast, he and Lugosi are just about the only ones that stand out.Doubling for the Mary Celeste is a British sailing ship used in World War I to hunt down German subs. Shooting parts of the film aboard an actual sailing ship lends some documentary-style assistance to this otherwise dry film.The transfer is pretty good, and probably the best that could have been made given the age of the film. The transfer reportedly came straight from the original nitrate film elements of the American version.",Phantom Ship

Loose ends are left as such and the viewer is left wondering why any of the characters were introduced in the first place.

437481,"After the disappointing third installment of the &quot;Alien&quot; franchise, many (myself included) felt that the series had no more stories to be told.  Fortunately, Weaver (co-producer of this film) and company had a few surprises left for moviegoers.Having the story take place in a more distant future, it allowed for the &quot;reincarnation&quot; of one of filmdom's most dynamic heroines: Ellen Ripley.  Weaver, who really understands the character, is able to bring a new persona in the Ripley clone while maintaining the strength of the woman that is so familiar to fans of the films.Basically this one reworks much of the original as each of the crewmembers is systematically eliminated.  The addition of the Ripley's &quot;offspring&quot; is frighteningly tragic.  A highlight is Ripley offering motherly consolation as she prepares to do what is necessary to save the remaining crewmembers as well as she.The cast is great, with Weaver, Ryder, and Perlman standouts in their respective roles.The movie's ending does set the stage for the fifth, and probably, last installment.And I, like most, will be standing in line for an admission!",Alien Resurrection VHS
150948,"I disagree with Patrick Moore's quibbles, and am delighted that sound and color recorded over 50 years ago survive so well.Yes, this version takes minor liberties with the original.  Wilde never mentioned &quot;Ernest&quot; singing &quot;La Donn' e Mobile&quot; in the tub with servants awaiting the final note's fair resounding before rinsing our star (Pavarotti was only 16 at the time, so we must settle for a baritone).  In fact the original initial scene is in Algy's digs; &quot;Ernest&quot; is already dry and dressed, albeit with much the same dialog.  In the film, no nasty solicitor wants to lock &quot;Ernest&quot; up for a trifling 762 Pounds (10 to 15 years' income for Algy's valet Lane) owed for supping if not stomping at the Savoy.  These are the most significant departures, and I did not find them disturbing.  As must be apparent, I sorta enjoyed the tub aria and believe Wilde might have liked it too.Redgrave, father of Vanessa, Corin and Lynn, was 44, a bit too old to play a man of 29 in the company of a cast that is otherwise of appropriate age.  Again, this is a minor point, especially given his brilliant performance.I will not repeat others' praise of the performances of the cast beyond saying that in watching the marvelous BBC-TV version, I felt so sorry for its great cast, having to compete with these performances, and extend equal sympathy to Colin Firth &amp; co. in the newly released film.  Even legends Judi Dench (in the new film) and Joan Plowright (in the BBC set) could never say &quot;A HA-and-BA-ag?!&quot; like Edith Evans did.  I admired Plowright for not trying to be Evans, whose delivery of this single line is mentioned on hundreds of web sites.The costumes are stunning and appropriate to both period and cast. (Does anyone else feel sorry about the Birds of Paradise hacked apart to build the millenery?  Folks didn't worry much about that in 1952, probably even less in 1895, so the headgear is probably authentic, even if counter to modern sensibilities.)As good as the cast is, most giving the performance best remembered from a career of brilliancies, the real star, of course, is Oscar Wilde, who skewers the British upper crust so deliciously with line after clever priceless line.  Half the lines in this play must have found their way into some collection or other by now.This marvelously funny play is also a tragedy because it was Wilde's last great work when it should have been followed by volumes of others.  Soon after its appearance, Wilde was  ruined, villified, amd imprisoned, never saw his children again.  He died poor, friendless, and miserable in a Paris hotel in 1900, his 46th year, five years after &quot;Earnest's&quot; first performance.  What other delightful manifestations of his brilliance were denied us by society's inability to accept the bisexual nature that Wilde could not help?  I'm a big hairy straight guy from a redneck background, but even I know that the most tragic loss of a Bird of Paradise in conjunction with this play was that of Wilde himself.",N/A
389947,"I saw ""Two Women"" on VHS, an Embassy Entertainment edition whose cover doesn't look like the cover shown here on Amazon.  The film quality wasn't great but it was certainly adequate.  It's worth looking for decent copy of this film for it's one that shouldn't be missed.This is a film showing the tragedy and pain that befalls ordinary people in the time of war.  It's also a film about the relationship of a mother (Sophia Loren) to her 12 year-old daughter, a relationship that is warm and loving yet one that war tries to tears apart.Those who are convinced of the ""necessity"" or the ""logic"" of military action should watch ""Two Women"" and see how such action disrupts and tears up individuals, families and communities.  The dislocation, food shortages, rape and death depicted in this film are all vestiges of war that have not changed and still affect war-torn areas today.The characters in this film are all very real, very believable;  and this gives it greater credibility.

160238,"We've all seen the ""beach scene"" and I have to say that I was disappointed that it was so short in the actual film.Montgomery Clift (who the producers didn't want but the director stubbornly fought for) is the real star here, giving a wonderfully layered performance as a former boxer who will not join the service team, under any circumstances.  He is therefore put through all sorts of hell to get him to reconsider.  He takes it with quiet grace and confidence, sure that he can take anything other than getting back into the ring.  Clift's best friend Maggio (Frank Sinatra) is always taking up for him and definitely pays the price later on.  Sinatra is wonderful in this Oscar-winning performance.Clift's sergeant, Burt Lancaster, is meanwhile having an affair with his commanding officer's wife, Deborah Kerr, playing bad girl against type.  I didn't really care much about their relationship because the commanding officer was such a jackass.The romantic angle that matters here is the one between Clift and Donna Reed (who also won an Oscar) as a dance hall girl (yes, that Donna Reed!).  Theirs is a truly sweet love, more so because they are both so damaged and vulnerable.The Pearl Harbor scenes, once they happen after all this quiet time, are truly shocking (especially when a soldier is gunned down by a plane while running to warn others), although you do get subtle hints at what is coming.  In one scene, where Lancaster is on the phone planning to do something the next day, a calendar behind him clearly reads ""December 6.""Through all this, I was never bored.

This may indeed be the superior series of the Black Adder set but you can decide for yourself. Six episodes, each a gem of comic writing and acting. Hugh Laurie's ""George"" is more well rounded than the third series while Tim McInnery's return is a welcome site. Still, credit must go to Rowan Atkinson and Tony Robinson for their stand-out performances.The writing is again superb, but the real genius of the plot is the underlying message of the futility of war and the staggering waste of human life. In the final moments of episode 6, we observe the purest moment of humanity; Baldrick's wish to lay down arms and live in peace, Darling's dream of a quiet suburban life about to shatter, and George's dumbfounded realization that his lineage, education, and money won't stop the fact that he is frightened and about to die. As the picture of stoic grace, Black Adder brings the calamity to a close with the final charge over the top. As the battlefield fades, a field of red poppies bloom in tribute to the men and women of the British Armed Forces who lost their lives. It still brings tears to my eyes with each viewing.

245675,"TRIBES belongs to a little-known sub-genre of 'The young man goes off to war' movie, best exemplified by Jack Webb in THE DI. Unlike THE DI, which has stood the test of time as the prototype of all such movies, TRIBES now is seen as a curious period piece in which a hippie is drafted into the US Marines and finds himself squarely opposed by the short-haired establishment symbolized by a marine drill instructor, superbly played by Darren McGavin. Jan-Michael Vincent plays Adrian, the hippie.  Much of this movie plays like a rerun of THE DI.  There is the hard-as-nails DI breaking down the recruits only to rebuild them into the sanctioned image of gung-ho marines.  Early in the film, the DI soon realizes that Adrian is a square peg who has been ordered to fit into a round hole.  Adrian shows up at boot camp wearing long hair and sandals, causing a predictably angry response from the DI.  At this point the movie becomes a test of culture-vs-culture, with each side refusing to blink.  Adrian is seen as some sort of mythic superman who is able to draw from his inner chi the strength and stamina to outperform all his fellow recruits.  The battle from the DI's point of view is external: the drill field, the shooting range, the obstacle course.  From Adrian's perspective, it is internal. Whenever he is called upon to perform heroic feats of exercise, the scene shifts from Adrian's 'now' to Adrian's 'then.' This 'then' is punctuated by hippie music and a pretty girl with flowers in her hair.  The DI does not know how Adrian manages to excel but he is pretty sure that he is up against a force of internalized nature that soon threatens to spread to the other recruits who see Adrian's daily exploits and beg him to reveal his Mahesh Yogi secrets.  Adrian explains in pseudo-hippie jargon of the late 1960's that ""Man, you have to move yourself from the present world of hurt to a past world of good.""It is not difficult to see that in any confrontation between DI and recruit, any victory by the recruit can only be temporary.  Surprisingly enough, Adrian's DI blinks first. He passes Adrian only to learn that the senior DI, who sees the hippie philosophy of Adrian as a menace greater than the communist dialectic of Marx and Engels, has failed Adrian on a technicality and orders him recycled to repeat the entire twelve week course of basic training.  Adrian goes AWOL, thereby affirming the power of the state over the individual.  Yet, the victory of the state may be as hollow and as ephemeral as was the early victory of the recruit over the system. As a new group of recruits enters the very grounds where Adrian trained just recently, the DI stands ready to receive them, but this time he carries with him a flower of Adrian to remind him that though tribes may differ dramatically if only externally, there is some core resemblance that connects hippie to DI and the state to the individual.  Perhaps it is this knowledge that we are more alike than commonly perceived which makes this movie eminently watchable--even if Jack Webb would not understand.",Vuelven los Siete Magníficos
717559,"If you didn't see this wonderful Lost World minseries A&E; did, buy the DVD or video. Or do like I did-buy it after having seen it on A&E.; It was spectacular, by far the best film adaptation I have seen of Sir Arthur Conan Doyle's novel. No, it doesn't stay true to the novel (face it, few films ever stay true to the novels they are based on), but the differences actually make the story enjoyable and interesting in its own right separate from the novel.The changes from the novel include the following:1) Professor Challenger-in the book, he is not at all a likeable character, and is not meant to be, but in the film, they made him more amenable, yet still kept much of his stubborness and self-righteousness. It was a good compromise for the purpose of viewer accetability of a main character.2) Agnes Clooney-the female member of the team in the film was not in the novel, but is still a welcomed addition. She is a more liberated woman in some ways, but it isn't done over the top so she is beating up savages and shooting up things (she isn't Sheena, Queen of the Jungle, and that type of character wouldn't have fit in this story). Rather, Agnes as a character does fit a woman living in her circumstances in that time.4) The Demented Reverend-He wasn't in the book either, but I actually think he wasn't a very good addition. I'm kind of sick and tired of this cliched evil missionary character who kills in the name of the lord. Its been done to death. Thought, admittedly, Peter Faulk played this character very well, and did instill in him more soul and complexity than most of these evil missionary stereotypical characters get in most films.One thing I really liked about this film was how it was an action/adventure story, but it also made you think about what was going on in the story. It had some really good things to say about man's interaction with nature, and preservation of the environment against exploitation. Challenger, towards the end of the film, makes a comment about science often not being accessible to the public at large without it being dressed up a bit as entertainment. This is exactly what this film does in some ways. It presents and entertaining, engrossing adventure, but also presents interesting scientific thoughts about ecology. Just what can happen when man starts mucking about and disturbing the balance of nature?And the answer to that question wasn't entirely clear in one circumstance. The dispute between Challenger's point of view versus Lord Roxton's view on what to do with the Ape Men in the film. They were both right and both wrong from my view. This really points to the difficult balance between how much we should interfere in nature and how much we should just leave things alone.I recommend this film very highly to anyone who loves the original novel, or action/adventure stories in general. This film continues A&E;'s record of excellence in creating film adaptations of classic stories.",N/A
362743,"I'd give this movie 10 stars if possible.  I watched this movie everyday when I was a kid and when i watch it now, i can still recite it. This is such a great movie.  As some of the other reviewers said, this movie is a little more realistic, a little grittier.This movie truly does have something for everyone.  Children will love the talking creatures, the ridiculous crow, Jeremy, (voiced with perfection by Dom DeLuise), and they'll recognize the overwhelming, self-sacrificing love Mrs. Brisby (the mother) displays for her family.  Adults will enjoy the more subtle humor as well as the message of pure love conquering all obstacles.  This movie (along with my role model mother) formed my image of how mothers should be: loving, strong and self-sacrificing.  Even when Mrs. Brisby if forced to face her deepest fears (an owl, the cat), she does it, not without fear, but to save her son's life.  This is a touching movie.Another point of appreciation for this movie is that it does not try to simply dumb things down for kids.  I like most  Disney movies but this aims a little higher.  There are some deep issues, such as death, jealousy, fear and hate, that aren't dwelt on but are brought up and as children grow older, they will grow to understand and love this movie more and more.",N/A

It is not slick, opting for a docudrama style that focuses on characters and story.  The plot concerns an American training camp for soldiers who will be shipping off to Vietnam.  We've seen this type of story before (e.g., Full Metal Jacket) - young soldiers are broken down by the army and then built back up as killing machines, but Tigerland remains fresh, largely due to the talented cast.Tigerland stars Irishman Colin Farrel in his first large role, and he gives a star making performance.  His character (Roland Boz) is anti-army and anti-authority, and he does not see the sense in having people fight wars who are emotionally not equipped to handle it.  He invariably clashes with his superiors as well as his peers (they are punished for his misbehavior).  However, ironically, he ends up helping several of them, particularly Miter, outstandingly played by Clifton Collins Jr. (who also excelled in 2000 as the gay drug dealer Frankie Flowers in ""Traffic"").  Tigerland asks many big questions regarding war and bravery, but it wisely does not provide easy answers.The DVD includes a commentary track by Joel Schumacher.  This track is extremely interesting, as Schumacher describes how he had a small budget and how he managed to do what he needed to do for the film.  The DVD also includes Colin Farrel's screen tests, which are fascinating.  Farrel is a compelling actor who currently has a number of high profile films in the can, including ""Hart's War"" with Bruce Willis and the Steven Speilberg/Tom Cruise film, ""Minority Report.""  Expect great things from him.",N/A
283150,"This gem should hit many different emotions for the avid viewer. A true parade of carnival characters set in an antiwar theme -- this bit of royalty of the heart brings up aTHE enigma: Is the difference between psychosis and psychic just a paper-thin line of cultural subjectivism? Is the lunacy of blowing up yet another vacant city on the path to glory any different that skipping naked down a path with a birdcage in one's hand?This film started the boomers reading subtitles and (hopefully) brought them out of their fears of foreign film. (Don't get the dubbed version, it lacks so much charm.) Its popularity had a great deal to do with the country's mass-consciousness about the Viet Nam war; but I hope it would have found the same audience without such a catalyst.One feels like dancing in a fountain and blowing bubbles on the back of a bus after seeing this great flick. Keep a kazoo handy; you'll want to have something to toot after the film is over and you are left to your organized sanity!Better yet, follow it up with the 1972 release of &quot;The Ruling Class&quot; and have yourself a truly insane evening of jocularity.",N/A

554675,"This is my second favourite Dr Who adventure behind the Android Invasion with Tom Baker and Elizabeth Sladen but I like the double team of Jon Pertwee and Katy Manning a lot more.The story is that the Doctor and Jo materialize inside a ship, the SS Bernice on the Indian Ocean in 1926.Jo thinks that they are still on Earth but the Doctor thinks even though they havent reached their destination, Metebelis 3 that they are on one of the neighbouring planets. Jo gets upset when he won't admit that they are on Earth and he tells her it is impossible. In fact,the doctor later figures out that they are in a Miniscope. This scope is in fact on a planet called Inter Minor and the owner won it gambling and doesn't quite know much about it himself.The Doctor and Jo keep going back to the ship and keep running into the crew and passengers, Major and his daughter.Jo notices that the crew and passengers keep repeating their words and behaviour which is risible and reminds me of Groundhog Day.Eventually the Doctor and Jo escape into the subterranean workings of the minsicope and end up outdoors. They then run into the ferocious Drashigs which are kind of like dinosaurs.After this, the doctor figures out that they can't go forward because they will go back to the ship and they can't go back they will re-encounter the Drashigs so they have to act laterally. Eventually the Doctor escapes from the Miniscope and plans a way to set free JO and all the other sentient lifeforms in the scope. He goes back inside the compression field of the scope and using the TARDIS he is successful in his plan.The funny thing is when all the lifeforms are returned to their own times is that the Major who was reading a book said it was the longest book he ever read and his daughter suspected somewhere in her mind that something peculiar had happened but couldn't put her finger on it.I bought the DVD and it has a commentary by the actress Katy Manning who played the Doctor's companion Josephine Grant.Great stuff.I recommend this to all Jon Pertwee and DR Who fans.",N/A
410873,"Vincent Price gives his best performance as the last man on Earth. And what a bleak earth it is, one overcome by plague, death, and cold, and overrun by zombie-like vampires. The middle of the story goes back in time, as we see how he once was a happy family man, until the plague came about. Then he was a hardworking scientist desperatley trying to stop it. And finally he was a survivor, slowly being driven to madness by both his lonliness, and the fact that the undead creatures are outside his house every night, calling his name, and trying to get him. The viewer puts himself in Morgan's shoes, imagining what it would be like to live in such a bleak, cold world. The film is very depressing, as we see him slowly lose his family to the plague. His everyday routine is maddening in itself. He sharpens stakes, seeks out sleeping vampires, stakes them, and takes them to a horrible burning pit, reminicent of the ones dug during WW2 for the executed Jews. It was shot 3 years before Romero's ""Night of the Living Dead"", and one can certainly see where Romero drew his inspiration, from the grainy black and white cinemotography, to the bleak storyline of the world coming to an end and being taken over by the dead. The vampires trying to break in Morgan's home at night are nearly identical to Romero's zombies, trying to get into the farmhouse. It contains many scary and disturbing images. The film is way ahead of its time, and on a shoestring budget, manages to be much scarier than any of the multimillion dollar so called ""horror"" that we are subject to today....highly recommended.",Last Man on Earth VHS

It is a bit of a departure for Woody Allen, in that his character actually believes in a spirit world, whereas Woody Allen is always an atheist/agnostic in his movies, as he is in life.  There are some genuinely hilarious moments, as well as a fine exploration of interpersonal relationships and marital fidelity.Highly recommended!",N/A
478188,"Cowboy Bebop isn't just good anime. You'll read a lot of reviews that compare it to other groundbreaking anime like Akira and Ghost In The Shell, but that sells this excellent series short.'Anime' describes not just a style of animation, but a collection of story conventions, none of which appear in Cowboy Bebop. There are no tentacled monstrosities, no Megacorporations conspiring to destroy NeoTokyo, no weird nature spirits being corrupted by consumerism.Instead we're left with one of the best TV series' ever. Almost everything that happens will make perfect sense to the average western viewer, and it all stands up to any modern TV series. The Sopranos, The West Wing, Queer as Folk, it's got them all beat. Because unlike all of these excellent shows, Cowboy Bebop switches tone, scope, and genre with almost every episode. One episode is slapstick farce, one is romantic soap opera, one is nail-biting action, one is tense psychothriller. And Cowboy Bebop never misses a beat, each episode is finely crafted with a level of detail given each 22 minutes that you'd normally have to watch an entire series of to see on HBO.Cowboy Bebop also has something all other western shows lack; Yoko Kanno. Her music is sheer genius. She works playfully and seriously in every style, and thus fits these fantastic stories that are sometimes insightful, sometimes meaningful, sometimes sublime, sometimes ridiculous. Cowboy Bebop loves its own soundtrack and devotes one or two scenes each episode to showcase the music. The director intentionally lets Kanno's music come to the fore and orchestrates several scenes with no dialog in order to let the music shine. Few shows do this, and Cowboy Bebop does it well. The emotional impact of each episode is raised to new levels though the use of her music, and you'd be a fool not to buy the soundtrack.The series is a Sci-Fi romp set in the near future, our solar system. The main characters are bounty hunters (called 'cowboys') onboard a spaceship (the Bebop) owned by an inveterate jazz aficionado who dreams of Charlier Parker. `Bounty hunter' may evoke dark mysterious characters like Boba Fett, and the main characters here *do* have mysterious pasts and they *are* lethal killers, but they're entirely human, living day to day on the few bounties they bring in. The characters can be serious, funny, sexy, goofy. . .everything you'd expect from realistically drawn characters who are, at the same time, lethal killers.Don't mistake this for Anime, it obliterates the genre conventions and comes screaming out of the gate with a refreshing collection of stories that will make you pound your cable box and scream ""why can't it all be like this!?!"" The director and writer are aware of what they've created, these characters are living day by day, achieving nothing significant in their lives, yet they're having a great time and we have a great time with them. We don't want it to end. The main character asks us, ""Don't you want to hang out with us and waste your life away?"" The answer, of course, is `yes,' and the writer knew it when he wrote it.One aspect which is decidedly *not* western, is the ending. This show ends the only way it could, the most fulfilling way possible, and when the credits roll for the final time, you'll feel like you lived an entire lifetime in the past few hours.And what a lifetime it was...",Cowboy Bebop - Session 1
535869,"""The Wedding Planner"" has all the originality, credibility and wit of a bad TV sitcom.  The film boasts a storyline so hoary and wheezy that one could probably trace its antecedents all the way back to that marvelous 1934 classic ""It Happened One Night"" - if not indeed even further back than that.  It's the oldie about the bride-or-groom-to-be who discovers just at that crucial last moment, when all the guests have gathered for the wedding, that he or she is actually marrying the wrong person and that his or her real, honest-to-God genuine true love is just out there waiting in the wings ready for the taking.  ""The Wedding Planner"" doubles our pleasure by having TWO such disastrous weddings happening at the same time.Like far too many lazy romantic comedies, ""The Wedding Planner"" is based on a premise so reeking of incredibility, coincidence and contrivance that any attempt to connect it to the real world vanishes at the outset (and before you accuse me of being an unromantic and of not understanding that suspension of disbelief is an essential ingredient in any film in the romantic comedy genre, I will just point to the brilliant 1967 film ""Two For the Road"" as evidence that this does not have to be the case).  Jennifer Lopez plays Mary Fiore, a hotshot wedding planner so absorbed in the minutiae of her work that she just can't seem to find the time or the inclination to look for Mr. Right herself.  One day she is ""rescued"" from near-death - in a scene of stultifying stupidity - by a handsome pediatrics doctor named Steve, played by Matthew McConaughey.  A feeling of mutual attraction develops between them, which leads to heady complications when, to Mary's utter amazement (but to no one else's in the audience), Dr. Steve turns out to be the fianc&eacute;e of the very woman whose wedding Mary has been planning.  As always, the well-intentioned characters struggle with the complexities of the situation, momentarily consider the feelings of their future spouses, then immediately run off and do what's best for themselves anyway.  And why is it that, in situations such as this one, those rejected suitors always turn out to be either so self-absorbed and hateful that we don't care a bit if they're hurt by the wedding day turnabout, or so completely self-negating and understanding that they end up happily wishing the newly formed couple bon voyage with the rest of their friends and family?  Either way the audience is let off the hook and we are free to root for our two main characters with a clear conscience.  Some genres just have hopeless conventions I guess.One could conceivably overlook the mountain of clich&eacute;s under which the story lies buried had the film at least managed to bring even a touch of freshness, style and wit to its execution.  Instead, we are subjected to an assortment of silly, lowbrow antics such as Mary finding herself on an out-of-control horse so that Steve can ride along and rescue her, or Steve breaking off the genitals of a statue and having to hold the newly glued piece on while talking to a policeman.  The dialogue doesn't help to raise the sophistication level of the film much either.Where ""The Wedding Planner"" really falls down, however, is in the performance department.  Jennifer Lopez appears to be a reasonably likable and attractive young woman, but she seems hopelessly puerile and amateurish both in her line readings and in her body language.  McConaughey is his usual blank self, and virtually every supporting player is forced to indulge in the broadest sort of comic overacting in a desperate attempt to wring at least SOME laughs out of this tired material.The way I look at it is this:  if you have seen ""Runaway Bride"" - yet another bad romantic comedy - you've already seen ""The Wedding Planner.""  So skip it and rent ""Two For the Road"" and see what great romantic comedy is really all about!",N/A

288835,"This musical adaptation of James Hilton's novel about the romance between a boring schoolmaster and a west end actress (at least she is in this version) clearly aims at success. The title credits reveal such names as Oswald Morris (photography), John Williams (musical direction), Terence Rattigan (screenplay) and Herbert Ross (director). Such an impressive line-up leaves us in no doubt that the producers were pitching for a smash-hit to rival My Fair Lady or The Sound of Music . Why, then, Leslie Bricusse? The presence of his name virtually guarantees dullness. As expected, only one or two numbers (the School Song, perhaps, and London is London) come close to the target, and the rest are almost unbelievably banal. Only John Williams's lively orchestrations save the musical numbers from total failure.O'Toole is bereft of Robert Donat's charm, and even seems heartless at times, rather than merely shy and inept. Indeed, in the first few scenes he appears to be a rescusitation of Andrew Crocker-Harris, the cold schoolmaster from ""The Browning Version"", which is no coincidence, since they share the same writer, Terence Rattigan. Otherwise, the screenplay is one of the most satisfying aspects of the production. In fact, as a drama it is reasonably successful; unfortunately, Bricusse's songs are only sporadically hummable (the lyrics are atrocious), as usual, and weaken what could have been a much better film. The makers of Goodbye, Mr Chips had a lot to live up to, the story having been memorably filmed some thirty years earlier, so it is no surprise that they miss the mark. It does, however, manage to retain some charm.",N/A

But what struck me most, listening to the DVD late at night under headphones so as to not disturb my family, was the sound.The outdoor scenes, of which there are many, are phenomenally recorded.

602262,"The debate has raged long and hard as to which of the adaptations of Thomas Harris's novel Red Dragon is superior with most people plumping for whichever version they saw first. For this is the problem with remakes (or watching a movie having already enjoyed the novel) and particularly with thrillers, where it's the twists and turns that dictate just how much viewing pleasure and excitement there is for the audience. So at the end of the day being objective about which movie is better and how to rate each one is very difficult (and perhaps all that serves to prove is the pointlessness of the debate) but for what it's worth here goes...In a third outing as the world's favourite cannibal Anthony Hopkins returns in this prequel to ""The Silence of The Lambs"", complete with a ponytail in a new and very clever opening sequence that pits Hannibal Lecter against the FBI's special agent Will Graham (Edward Norton). Directed by Brett Ratner, (a surprise choice given that his last two outings were The Family Man and Rush Hour 2), Red Dragon sets out to recapture the tension of Jonathan Demme's multi-oscar winning ""Silence of The Lambs"" and to this end the sets of Hannibal Lecter's prison cell have been expertly recreated. Anthony Heald makes a return as the disgustingly sleazy asylum boss, Dr Chilton and Anthony Hopkin's part is inflated from both the novel of its origin and Manhunter. For make no mistake, this is (unlike Ridley Scott's Hannibal) not a Hannibal Lecter film, just as it was never a Hannibal Lecter novel. Instead the focus of Red Dragon is actually Will Graham's showdown with his own inner demon's and another serial killer, Francis Dollarhyde, christened the Tooth Fairy by the movie's tabloid press and played expertly by the ever excellent Ralph Fiennes, complete with a body toned by months of lifting weights and an enormous tattoo, (present in the novel but absent from the book) of the eponymous Red Dragon, covering his entire back.But is it any good? Well, I genuinely believe that how much you enjoy this movie wholly depends on whether or not you have previously seen and enjoyed Michael Mann's original cult movie of the same novel, because for the most part both movies follow the same path and in places the same script. Being objective, and trying to put aside the baggage of having both seen and enjoyed Manhunter (I own it on VHS), I have to admit that this is by Hollywood standards a superior thriller with an excellent cast. As previously mentioned, to my mind Ralph Fiennes is both the star and strength of this movie. However, despite being an enormous fan of Edward Norton's previous work (Primal Fear, American History X, Fight Club, The Score etc.), I would have to say that he was miscast as special agent Will Graham in that his appearance is too preppy and his portrayal seems to lack the inward depth of a man tortured by his own thoughts and the mental scars of his previous (mental and physical) duel with Dr Lecter. Don't get me wrong Edward Norton's performance is fine but it just lacks that spark and charisma of his other roles, which I cant help but feel is partly as a result of being miscast and partly as the result of some uninspired by the numbers direction by Brett Ratner. As for Anthony Hopkin's, he is surprisingly forgettable. His part is little more than a cameo, where he only just steers clear of hamming it up and fails to chill in the same way as he did in his Oscar winning performance back in 1991's Silence of The Lambs.  Harvey Keitel meanwhile is as reliable as ever as Graham's FBI boss Jack Crawford but although fine (scant praise for such fine actors) Phillip Seymour Hoffman and Emily Watson are only required to sleepwalk through their parts on cruise control. This is perhaps because they have small and undemanding roles with not enough character development or screen time to get their teeth into the parts. That aside there is also much to recommend Red Dragon, other than Ralph Fiennes excellent performance. The pre-credits sequence for example and the finale are both very thrilling and very enjoyable and there are several other scenes throughout the movie, particularly those featuring Francis Dollarhyde's character development, that were absent in Manhunter but more prevelant in the novel, which positively add to the viewing experience.The debate will no doubt rage long and hard but in the end which one is better is a pointless argument and a moot point. The best way to watch either movie is with an open mind but once you have seen either version its probably best to avoid the other, as your perceptions of the plot, the characters and their appearance will in all likelihood be indelibly set, thus spoiling your enjoyment of any other version. I'm scoring this one a draw, four stars ****.",N/A

She sings high pianissimo beautifully and her trills are brilliant in ""Vissi d'arte"". In contrast to other's acting, her acting is full of details and subtleties, dramatizing a proud, fiery, and willing-to-die-for-love Tosca wonderfully. Domingo's approach to Cavaradossi is heroic, poetic, and quite attentive. His voice is silvery; he looks virile, although a bit too wide his girth for a young Cavaradossi. ""Recondita armonia"" is sung with passion and graceful turns. In ""E lucevan le stelle"" he conveys the farewell to life with deep emotions and climaxes the aria in a wonderful outburst of ""E non ho amato mai tanto la vita"".

Also, did he really need that ugly unnatural-looking nose?The film was exquisitely made, from the interior of the grand chapel to the crystals on Scarpia's dining table, everything was carefully chosen.

145576,"Granted, this flick is intellectually devoid. So why do I like it? Well, inspite of its many flaws (i.e., the ducks-in-a-row ambush/chorus line at the beginning [each man with a different weapon of incompatible ammo], recoiless MAC-10's that never run out of ammo, reloadable LAWs rockets, CIA headquarters being in Washington and not Langley, shall I go on....?), I think that it helps to watch it as less of a movie and more of a Tangerine Dream video. I first saw this movie in '82 when it was released (I was 15 then). Back then, my high school newspaper would editorialize about how Reagan and Haig would lead the human species to nuclear extinction. Unlike my whiney, Berkley-bound peers at the time, this movie helped me crash through the HANDS ACROSS AMERICA THE DAY AFTER I saw it and regard the possibility of global calamity as, well, exciting (the town I grew up in kind of sucked). This film does max out the intrigue of the day by way of its touching the realistic nerve of the oil matter local to a time of mile long fuel lines in America in collusion with the red menace moving northward (at least, that's what THEY said) from Central America. It has some noteworthy effects: the ski jump and the sawed-off-under-the-sleeve (Charles Bronson would've won the Oscar if he was depicted plugging some low-life that way in &quot;Death Wish&quot;). Oh yeah, look for a young Edward R. Rooney as the President's National Security Advisor.

With parts of the movie loosely based on his life you can really see that he probably wasn't doing much acting. The story is good and Em just makes it seem to come naturally. Truthfully this movie keeps it real. There is no one moment where you know everything is going to be ok and our protagonist is suddenly surrounded by wealth.

452347,"Let's be honest. What you're buying here is the classic Mel Brooks movie you know and love. You're curious about the extra stuff, but not much is learned here - save from the fact that Mel Brooks alludes to the possibility of an affair by Gene Wilder with Teri Garr while filming.Actually, the Mel Brooks commentary is great. It's interesting to listen to him as a director, and not a zany comedian. It gives an insight into this aspect of his personality, and is worth listening to.The documentary is okay, but not groundbreaking. It seems pretty half-heartedly put together, without really getting into the nuts and bolts of how the movie was filmed.The outtakes are somewhat amusing. Once. I doubt I'll ever watch them again. I guess it's nice to have - to watch Wilder, Feldman, et al break character and laugh - but once you've seen it once - there's no real reason to watch it again.The movie is a classic, however.

For starters, episodes 5 through 7 are all &quot;glitchy&quot;, and I often get some skips during the animation.  Also, some episodes can't be chosen from the menu without my getting a &quot;Disc Error&quot;.  It could be just the incompatibility from my DVD Player, but incompatibilities are annoying, and should be fixed.  Otherwise, the DVD has crisp, clean picture, and great sound.Also, you get seven great episodes into one DVD.  Can't go wrong there, now can you?  Street Fighter II V is a fast-moving series with great animation, great characters, and music...?  Well, I would have preferred an orchestra playing the music as opposed to the cheap synthesized sound playing in the background.  I would have also liked to see Manga use the original opening theme instead of their alternate one (which is still cool, however, the original is about ten times better).Nevertheless, this is a great series, and if you enjoy action-packed fighting scenes, then Street Fighter II V is the anime for you.

588141,"""Shallow Hal"" (2001)I will admit the rumours are true. The Farrelly's are going a little softer. Me, Myself and Irene and There's Something About Mary were quite sickening, but Shallow Hal comes a little more from the heart. While I enjoyed the Farrelly brothers' gross-out phase very much, I am immensely enjoy seeing them become less crude and try something new.The performances in this movie are the best thing in Shallow Hall, even though the Farrelly's directing is fabulous (their directing may be a result of the performances though). Jack Black gets his first full-on leading role and makes his character seem both shallow and sensitive. Jason Alexander doesn't do his best with this performance, and one of his twists in the story is probably the worst aspect of the film, but he still manages to make us chuckle a little. Gwyneth Paltrow is the magic in the movie. Paltrow embodies her amazingly nice and ferociously fat character with warmth and depth. When she smiles, I smile. When she cries...well, I almost cried. And come on, this is from the Farrelly brothers! Not the response you think of when you hear the phrase ""from the directors of Dumb & Dumber and There's Something About Mary"", but this movie's performances work wonders thank to its dedicated cast and directing efforts.The script in the film is of constant high quality. The idea was very original and the lead characters quite developed. The laughs in this movie were very funny and give the movie its crude humour. I actually preferred the romance in the movie. It felt less forced and not as fast as the jokes, the romance was very built up in the film. However the comedy was an important aspect of the film and the movie wouldn't have worked just as a romantic drama.Shallow Hal's message comes across wonderfully. This movie is all about seeing the inner-beauty in people and not just looking on the outside for their personalities. This moral is given across very cleverly and clearly, and if you come out of the film and you see an overweight person you might have second thoughts about judging them on their appearance. I thought it was wonderful how this movie brought this point across, and it worked for me on a personal level.Despite the excellence of the performances and message in the movie, there were flaws. As I mentioned earlier in this review, Jason Alexander's twist (won't ruin it in here) was just stupid, although it did make me fall on the ground with laughter, it was just silly. Some of the movie is quite predictable, and the hypnosis story could've been done better. Possible spoilers - After saying 5 words, a person wouldn't just click back into reality. Apart from that, the hypnotism idea did bring the point of the film across nicely sometimes, but the way Hal started seeing things normally again after Alexander's character saying 5 words to him over a cell phone is a little disappointing.The thing that puts Shallow Hal's flaws aside is its touching story. With some flat faults, I would usually give a film a B, but this movie will get higher than that because it showed the true feelings of loneliness and depression when obesity is involved. This movie is truly touching, uproariously funny and one of the best comedies of 2001. Oh, and did I mention Gwyneth Paltrow wears nothing more than a thong in one scene? Now, tell me, how could you possibly resist?MY GRADE: B+",Shallow Hal
699132,"Mark Pellington's highly stylized MOTHMAN PROPHECIES proves  that style can rarely hide the lack of a well developed story, which is the case here.  The film is far from bad--it's actually very decent, but could have been far better had the story been a little less cloudy and a little more concise(as it stands, about twenty or thirty minutes of the film could have been utilized to better effect).  The catalyst of the story is the frequent appearance of a moth-like creature, who appears to individuals with prophetic declarations of doom.  Though we never really see the &quot;creature&quot; per se, the effects of his prophecies drive the plot of the story.  Richard Gere underplays well in the lead role, and gets fine support from the always excellent Laura Linney(and thanks to the filmmakers for not following the cliched route and putting these two characters together romantically), Will Patton, and Alan Bates.  Again, Pellington's stylish direction doesn't completely save the film, but overall it is more than watchable.",N/A

So the Godzilla in the original movie was a guy in a suit, but I can just imagine what the directors of that one could have done with some CGI!  In the new version, Godilla is just an overgrown T-Rex.  How does an iguana go from being a lizard to a bipedal, bird hipped dinosaur anyway, even through extreme mutation?  It's just cheesy.

527592,"Jason Bigges and Mena Suvari are more or less likable in this film, and once you have noted that, there is virtually nothing else good to say about this film. Most of the other characters are intensely dislikable, and just about all the comedy is distinctly unfunny.Director Amy Heckerling previously directed two of the best teen films of the past two decades: FAST TIMES AT RIDGEMONT HIGH and CLUELESS. The latter was an inspired updating and adaptation of Jane Austen's EMMA. THE LOSER is also an adaptation, the plot of being borrowed fairly straightforward from Billy Wilder's THE APARTMENT. Bigges plays the Jack Lemmon role, Mena Suvari the Shirley MacLaine role, and Greg Kinnear the Fred MacMurray. The adaptation of Jane Austen worked in part because it was an inspired idea to reset EMMA in a Los Angeles high school in the 1990s, and in part because the script was so marvelous. The idea of resetting THE APARTMENT at NYU in the late 1990s fails in the first place because it is a really bad idea to remake one of cinema's greatest and funniest movies and in the second place because the script for the remake was so very, very unfunny. EMMA and CLUELESS were dissimilar as art forms (novel versus film) so that they didn't admit of very close comparison; THE APARTMENT and THE LOSER are both comic films set in NYC in the twentieth century, so they compare very easily. And, of course, THE APARTMENT makes THE LOSER look very, very bad indeed.But to be truthful, THE APARTMENT doesn't really make THE LOSER look much worse than it would have otherwise. It just isn't a very inspired film on any level. I liked the characters played by Bigges and Suvari, but after that, there wasn't really anything else recommending the film. In particular, Greg Kinnear's superficial, sadistic, and self-centered professor was especially damaging to the film.So, instead of watching this miserable remake of THE APARTMENT, just go watch THE APARTMENT again instead.",Loser

Yet they did, and for that I am ever so grateful.Just the story synopsis sounds so crazy. A puppeteer working on the 7 1/2 floor (originally built for midgets) finds a portal leading to the head of real life actor John Malkovitch, allowing annoying entering it to be Malkovitch for 15 minutes before being spit out on the side of the New Jersey Turnpike. Wow. And the movie is so much more weird then that. The first time I saw it, my mouth was wide open in shock. How did this movie get made? It's so crazy it's wonderful.With such a the head-trip of a story, it's easy to skip over the wonderful performances by the cast. John Cusack and Cameron Diaz look and act positively convincing as a poor, ugly and strange couple in New York. Catherine Keener is superb as a power-hungry, greedy woman who Cusack and Diaz both fall for, and of course Malkovitch as himself is both strange and intoxicating. Is it how he really acts? You never really know. And that's part of the charm of this wonderful film. The line of reality and fiction at times becomes fuzzy. A characteristic that writer Charlie Kaufman and director Spike Jonze play even more with in their follow-up Adaptation.Of course, all this weirdness means this film isn't for everyone.

662205,"Some years ago, an older generation gleefully watched an hilarious satire of Jackson Pollock's painting methods.  In &quot;Day of the Painter.&quot;  Pollock was portrayed as a con artist [pardon the pun!] who randomly threw paint on a board and foisted the result off on rich buyers.  This farcical depiction of Pollock remained the only valid image of him in the minds of many.  Was splattering paint on canvas truly a new art form, or the light-hearted playing of a man who had no professional training in his craft?Ed Harris has inverted this superficial personification to give us a truer picture of the man who established a new genre of North American painting.  Pollock is a supreme example of what good direction, good acting and a valid story can impart to film.  Harris doesn't strip Pollock down to examine him viscerally, nor does he give way to any &quot;postmodern&quot; ideals of what a film should depict.  Instead, Harris simply portrays Pollock as he was - driven by his art, expressive to extremes and aching for acknowledgment.  In giving us this portrait, Harris carefully avoids judgments of either Pollock or the art form he established.  With quiet intensity, Harris conveys the agonies Pollock suffered, both in his work and life.  It's to Harris' credit that the finest scenes in this film are those of him painting as Pollock did.  Every movement of his body, every facial expression conveys the seriousness Harris gave in this, his pet project, for a decade.Marcia Gay Harden is the deserved winner of her Academy Award for her portrayal of Pollock's wife and colleague.  An artist herself, Krasner was likely one of few women who could have sustained the years of Pollock's struggle.  Her faith in his work comes through with vivid intensity in Harden's role.  Her final break under the years of stress is superbly done by Harden in the near-final scene.In all, this film is a masterpiece of filmmaker's art.  Harris managed the filming with manifest abilities.  Directing himself in the painting scenes is hard to imagine.  His control of every scene is masterful.  He cannot garner enough accolades for his direction of an excellent team.  This is a film to treasure.  Whatever Harris takes on next will inevitably command attention.  One can almost conjure a list of personalities he might deal with in future films.  Will biography become his particularly specialty, or was his submersion into Pollock's personality too great to be duplicated with another figure?",Pollock
208597,"Falling into the same genre as 'Beverly Hills Cop', 1982's '48 HRS.' takes the good-cop, bad-crook scene and transforms it to fit Eddie Murphy's talents on a different scale. Instead of chasing high-profile criminals as 'Detective Axel Foley', Murphy portrays a loud-mouth convict teamed up with a hardass detective Jack Cates. Nick Nolte's roll as this chain smoking, trash-talking, loveable sleezbag sort of shadows performances by John Wayne and Clint Eastwood...only in a new age. The low-flash scene is set in California, where Cates (Nolte) loses a battle with two escape conns along with his gun...leaving two more plain-clothed officers dead. The thing I think you need to remember when watching these movies is that the lead cops never dressed in uniform, and you'll see more covertable classic 70s' cars than marked squad cars. Otherwise, Nolte is the perfect grunge policeman who teams up with Reggie Hammond (Murphy) to catch a ruthless killer who Murphy once sided with. From the moment Nolte takes Murphy out of jail for 48 hours, you can sense the racial heat and explosive attitudes of the two. This proved to make for a perfect comedy, as Nolte and Murphy race to kill the killers without killing eachother. Murphy has a classic scene in a highly exaggerated country western bar, where the confederate flag is on every wall and ""yee-haw!"" is a common thing to hear. Murphy raises the roof of the bar in a hilarious scene that could only work with this guy. 'Another 48 HRS' 10 years later was a predicted mistake, instead I think the director should've considered remaking the original scene and plot, but using the flash and movie effects not available in 1982. Maybe put a better suit on Nolte or give'em a hotter car...dont use women you would rather see with their clothes ON than off, and make the fight sequences and assaults more realistic. '48 HRS.' still never stops working though, you give a great idea to talented actors and you can make tons of mistakes while still having a great movie. '48 HRS' also features plugs from Annette O'Toole (Law and Order), Sonny Landham ('Lock-Up', 'Predator') and what-ever-happened-to Tara King ('The Avengers').

The Venusian's queen (Mari Blanchard) falls in love with Costello, only to order him and his companions to return to earth when Lou proves to be unfaithful.Long considered the team's worst film, Abbott and Costello Go to Mars is rather likeable in its own way. The slapstick humor is a little dated at times, but it will still tickle your funny bone. A decent flick to watch on a Saturday afternoon.",Abbott & Costello Go to Mars VHS
574020,"OK, I can see how this film is a classic and how important it must have been in 1972 when it was released.  It is beautifully filmed (especially the opening seaside scenes surrounding the bank robbery) and shares glimpses of a warm and inviting early-70s Paris, which is great.Richard Crenna as a French criminal is a bit hard for me to swallow.Alain Delon's character is cold and mean and elicits no sympathy or understanding from me.I was but a toddler when this film came out so I came of age with MTV, etc.  Perhaps my youth causes my attention to be fleeting...  The long, slow, no-dialog scenes in this film are tedious in my opinion.  Mildly tough to sit through.I should also deride the silly special effects in this film.  Part of the story involved a spectacular train robbery.  Most of the exterior scenes of this robbery were done with a toy train set in a crude model landscape.  Indeed the toy train is being shadowed by a plastic helicopter with a visible cable holding it in place.  Just 4 years later Star Wars was released - surely the state of the art for movie special effects in 1972 would have allowed a more realistic train/helicopter chase sequence.",N/A

He goes to rent and apartment and meets the Maria Schneider character. He rapes the Maria Schneider character, but that okay, cause you know that women really like that sort of stuff.Maria and Marlon agree to meet, just for sex, no names at the apartment. Is this maybe Loehengrin and not a Bertolucci film?Of course this makes tremendous sense. Marlon is middle aged and not to attractive. Maria is 20 something and drop dead gorgeous. Marlon also comes across as a self pitying dope who cannot string two words together. In another scene he violently sodomizes Schiender. The plot of this film could only exist as a fantasy of a middle aged man.The climax of the film (an expression one hesitates to use for a range of reasons) is when the Brando character falls in love and wants to continue the relationship. Schnieder rejects him rather forcefully end of film.The film has sparse dialogue, Marlon looks dreadful overacts continually and one wonders how anyone took it seriously. Probably because it came out prior to the women&#8217;s movement. It is hard to think of a contemporary director who would produce such a unrealistic portrayal of a female character.",N/A

The film feels like a very personal piece of moviemaking, as though it is a documentary brilliantly edited together to tell a simple, yet profound and moving story.

It wasn't as bad as it could have been, being a direct to video sequel and all, but it was really just a rehash of the first movie with a way smaller budget. And that brings me to today's offering, Wishmaster 3. Recentley we have been flooded with horrible direct to video horror sequels(such as Mangler 2, Childern of the Corn 7). So when I saw the trailer for Wishmaster 3 I was really upset. ...After debating for 20 minutes inside of Blockbuster I decided to rent it. And I was pleasantly surprised that I ended up liking this movie. Sure the Djinn is not as scary as Andrew Divoff, but I went along with the movie anyway. I was shocked that this movie had some real twists to it that even had me fooled. And the acting was good. That is what really floored me! The college kids in this movie could really act instead of sounding like they're reading. Most direct to video sequels have terrible acting (again Mangler 2! but that's a different story). To sum up my review, if you liked the first two movies you should definately pick this one up. This movie is way better than all those other really terrible direct to video movies.",N/A

Cliff by far is or was not the greatest bassist ever, his work on all metallica albums in the 80's wasnt produced that great, even though it had its kick ass moments with Anesthesia, for whom the bell tolls, and Orion.

430220,"Quatermass and the Pit (aka Five Million Years to Earth to those of us in the US)is a stunning science fiction film from Hammer. Produced during a period when Hammer films had begun to look cheap, Pit has a number of stunning performances and well designed action sequences. Although the optical effects haven't aged all too well (the sequence where we ""see"" the Martians during their eugenics war looks about as convincing as the Zanti Misfits in the Outer Limits), the acting and imaginative sets save the day. I do have to praise the opticals at the close of the film as they still look stunning and are quite imaginative.The plot is essentialy this; Martians left their planet and cultivated humanoids to be their slaves. They helped us along the evolutionary path. They also instilled something of their Martian mentality in us as well. When a spacecraft is discovered during a routine excavation for a new subway route, all hell breaks lose quite literally. A scientist named Quatermass (the delightful Andrew Keir) is called in to assist the military. The ship is actived and goes into something of a defense mode. It manipulates the humans turning them into Martians by somehow accessing a primal instinct programmed into humanity by the Martians.There's a great deal of discussion about the myth of the Devil, religion and how the Martians figure into it. The script is sharp, literate and interesting. Roy Ward Baker's direction is tight and controlled creating suspense throughout the film. Anchor & Bay have done a great job with the transfer and included audio commentary from the writer and director.I can't compare this to the television version produced for the BBC as I've never seen it but can't imagine a 6 hour version of this being anything but talky and less than suspenseful.",Quatermass & The Pit VHS

The phalanx of cannibals and vampire-like troops eating people alive and animatronic creatures like Licker, Zombie Dogs doesn't exactly fascinate either. Paul WS Anderson who also helmed the cheesy Mortal Kombat makes a movie that is stocked full of grunge rock to compensate for its lack of atmosphere.The only saving grace of the movie is Milla Jovovich hiking up the kick... factor with her resilient mantle.

544986,"'Bandit Queen' is an arthouse update of the old 70s exploitation movies, in which a relentless focus on female suffering is justified by a pseudo-feminist revenge-plot.  Taking us far away from the multi-coloured, song-and-dance Hindi spectaculars that are currently all the global range, Shekhar Kapur shows us an India riven by violence, poverty and a vicious caste system, where women are treated as subhuman.  Before she even hits puberty, Phoolan Devi is married off to an older man (dowry: rusty bicycle and old goat) and raped when she expresses dissatisfaction at her social lot.  When, some years later, she is nearly raped again by the landowner's son, it is she who is expelled from the community; she takes up with bandits and begins her first true love affair with the atypically sensitive Vikram, de facto leader while Babu Gujjar is in prison.  When the latter is released, now turned police informer, he resents the pretensions of this lower-caste woman (called a goddess by her followers), has her gang-raped by all his men, and publicly stripped and humiliated.  Having plumbed the lowest depths there are, Devi takes the blood-spattered road of vengeance, turning torture and massacre into a media-fuelled spectacle.When the director of 'Queen' later went on to make a film about Tudor-era royal conspiracies ('Elizabeth'), many were surprised because of the gaping differences in subject matter, but Kapur imposes his own concerns on the two movies: both feature outsider-women attempting to assert power in rigid male-dominated hierarchies; both emphasise the importance of costume, ritual and public spectacle in these societies, and the necessary reuninciation of sexuality and 'normal' femininity of strong women.  In both, the apparently immovable class system represented in heavy buildings and landscape is made fluid and unstable by Kapur's gliding camerawork that seems to make walls melt away.But whereas 'Elizabeth' was an artistic success, 'Queen' seems to me a manipulative failure.  This is mostly due to its reliance on a single source, the prison diaries of Devi, whereas the latter film created a web of conflicting viewpoints and omnipresent sense of surveillance.  It is of course right to expose the atrocities embedded in the Indian caste system, and the slavery of women; it is right that a woman denied a voice in her own country (where the film was banned) should be heard.  But the catalogue of unspeakable crimes inflicted on Devi has the effect of caricaturing the villains around her, turning her very real plight almost into a cartoon of repetitive violence.  There is no nuance of social analysis here; instead the most simplistic behaviouralism  - if such-and-such is inflicted on you, you will respond thus - depoliticising Devi's very real social transgression, reducing her to a mere melodramatic heroine, the 'woman wronged'.  Having stayed so closely with its heroine and her experiences of abuse, when the film has to distance itself from her violence (which it must to avoid endorsing eye-for-an-eye brutality), it feels like a betrayal.  By lingering on her suffering rather than her revenge, the latter is as abrupt, arbitrary and dreamlike as 'Lawrence Of Arabia', the vile murders shot with the same kind of exquisite taste and fussy staging, the political wholly subsumed to the deranged personal.  I always get a bit queasy when men direct these kind of pseudo-feminist pictures - more interested in her body than her voice, 'Queen' can only continues the dehumanisation of its so-called heroine.",N/A
597148,"Nicholas Meyer's gem of a film imaginatively catapults Victorian-era novelist H.G. Wells against the diabolical villainy of Jack the Ripper in San Francisco circa 1979.  Malcom McDowell (A Clockwork Orange) delivers an exceptional and convincing performance as the innocently naive Herbert George Wells whose idealistic dream of a futuristic utopia is disillusioned by the hedonistic, technological and violent decadence of the late twentieth century.  David Warner is comfortably at home in the present day as the sinister John Leslie Stevenson alias Jack the Ripper.  Mary Steenburgen (Back to the Future III) is remarkable as the innocent love interest for Wells, especially when one considers that the fireworks were both on-screen and off between her and co-star McDowell making the romantic chemistry between the two all the more credible.

586316,"All right...let it be said first off...Denzel got the Oscar, and no one deserved it more.  In this film, Denzel proves that he can play characters who are FAR from being nice guys.  Generally, he plays wholesome (or at least semi-wholesome) characters in his films and has been regarded by many as a great actor who, unfortunately, takes ""safe"" roles.  Well, my God...if this film didn't shatter that mold, nothing ever will.  Denzel's Alonzo is a foul-mouthed, fast-talking, street-wise demon who runs wild with a gun and badge, abiding only the rules of the street.  As for the rest of the film, I loved it.  Not a bad performance in it, though Dr. Dre could have done better.  Powerful direction, strong cinematography, great script.  Yes, I know...there are always detractors out there.  Like the guy who says ""How do we know Denzel's a cop?  No uniform, never goes to the police station...how do we KNOW?""  Well...how 'bout that badge, smart guy?  He's a NARC, man!  Narcs don't wear uniforms...it would kind of defeat the purpose of undercover work, wouldn't it?  And as we know from the phone call he makes to Jake (Ethan Hawke) in the opening scene, Alonzo doesn't do roll call.  And then there are those who say ""He doesn't have to answer to anyone, man...who's gonna believe cops act like that?""  Well...me, for one.  This is the LAPD we're talking about...probably THE most corrupt police department in the country.  And he's a ranking detective with his own division...he can pretty much write his own ticket most of the time...cuz like he says, ""It's not what you know.  It's what you can prove.""  And I believe it was the same reviewer who said that Scott Glenn's character, Roger, was Alonzo's ""Mystery Friend,"" and we had no idea who he was until later in the film.  I think it's pretty easy to discern from his first scene with Alonzo and Jake that Roger's a retired (or at least NEARLY retired) Narc.  We know that from the introduction of his character, as long as we pay attention.  And although it all hits you really fast and seems fairly incomprehensible upon first viewing, the subplot with his character is astonishingly easy to follow when you give the film another look.  That's the thing.  This film moves so fast, it takes a couple of viewings for everything to sink in...after a second viewing, everything is much clearer.  Well, no matter what, have a go at ""Training Day.""  My advice is to watch it at least twice.  Denzel's performance is so mesmerizing that it can distract you the first time you watch it...and, as I said, it moves pretty fast.  My analysis:  Five Stars.  Best film of its kind to come out of Hollywood in the past five years.  Do yourself a favor and see it...twice.  Your senses will thank you.",N/A

406353,"Basic Instinct screenwriter Joe Esterhas' wicked knowledge of the trangsgressions of the rich and the powerful are deftly exposed by director William Friedkin and Linda Fiorentino. She is perfectly cast as the psychologist and as the illicit liason Jade. Chazz Palminteri, her husband, and David Caruso, a tad young for the role, makes for an interesting storyline. The graphic sexuality exhibited is for adults only but the movie delivers the seedy underbelly of politics and power and illustrates how a woman scorned can enter into a circle from which she has no escape. Unlike the Last Seduction, Fiorentino is the victim and not the temptress yearning for the love she doesn't have. Unfortunately, her husband isn't it either. With Loreena McKennitt's soulful sounds and Linda's great performance, she eventually gets under your skin as a woman looking for love in all the wrong places. Maybe that was the moral rather than Joe Esterhas's preoccupation with all the women he couldn't have in high school (as one critic wrote). Deftly directed, superbly acted, and well-executed. Jade is worth a watch only because of Linda Fiorentino's emotional resonance and convincing performance. Chazz is as excellent as ever. -Felecia Constance Rowe",Jade Unrated Version  VHS
234949,"This 1968 film is based on the book by Carson McCullers.  The basic story is still there, which is that of a deaf mute who helps people but somehow cannot help himself. But a lot is missing.  Alan Arkin, then 34 years old, plays the deaf mute and does a masterful job.  Sondra Locke plays a teenage girl whose family rents a room to Arkin, Stacy Keach plays a drunk.  And Cecily Tyson plays the angry grown daughter of the Afro-American physician played by Percy Rodriguez.  All are excellent in their roles.The film is about loneliness in all its forms and is sometimes too sentimental and slow.  I understand that the story lines had to be changed in order to fit it all into a screenplay, but the result is an over-simplification of the complex novel. Without the richness of language and depth of characterization of the book, the film is a mere shadow of what I would have liked it to be. But the acting is so good and the theme of prejudice of various kinds against each of the flawed characters is done so well, even winning couple of Academy Award nominations, that it certainly has some things going for it.  I might have liked it more if I had not just read the book, which seems as fresh today as when it was written.

476645,"Star Trek: The Original Series Volume 9 - Well, if you have read my past reviews (now over 200) you'll know I am a big, big fan of Star Trek and all its forms. This is another volume in the DVD series of original episodes. This one has two of my all time favorites.Shore Leave: Is the story of an uncharted planet being explored for possible Shore Leave prospects. It is a special planet where all you have to do is imagine anything and this place whips it up and makes it come alive. Whether it was deadly or benevolent anything and everything is possible. Some great performances by William Shatner (Showtime, Miss Congeniality) and the Late Deforest Kelly (Waco, When Love Has Gone). Also a keen guest star shinning moment by Bruce Mars (Voyage To The Bottom Of The Sea, Mission Impossible) as Finnegan James T. Kirk old academy nemesis. It was written by Theodore Sturgeon ( Invaders, Land Of The Lost, The Twilight Zone) and directed by Robert Sparr (Batman, The Wild Wild West).The Squire Of Gothos is a fun frolic of a kid being a spoiled brat. This is a role cleverly being played by William Campbell (Love Me Tender, Back Lash) (who also played the Klingon Commander in my all time favorite Original episode of The Trouble With Tribbles') who performance is brash, bold, theatrical and very over the top. This is where the ""Q"" Continuum must have patterned themselves after. He is funny and in the end a great big spoiled brat.There are even shinning moments for dialogue and cleverness for Leonard Nimoy (Atlantis: The Lost Empire, Brave New World ) and George Takei (Mulan, Kissingger and Nixon ) as Spock and Sulu trying to match wits with the obnoxious Trelane! It turns out he is just a bad boy that just got carried away and in the end his parents remind him of what he is doing. Written by Paul Schnieder (Ben Casey, Eight Is Enough) and direct by Doug McDougall (Mission Impossible, Mannix) - this story is definitely clever and funny at times too!This is a good volume to have in the original Star Trek series.","Star Trek - The Original Series, Vol. 9, Episodes 17 & 18: Shore Leave/ The Squire of Gothos"
587812,"This was the best movie of 2002 that absolutely nobody saw. (There were better movies, but they all found their audiences.) The movie follows two stories -- the 19th-century romance between writers Randolph Henry Ashe (Jeremy Northam, ""Gosford Park"") and Christabel LaMotte (Jennifer Ehle, ""Wilde"") and the modern-day story of two researchers (Aaron Eckhart, ""Erin Brockovich,"" and Gwynneth Paltrow, ""Shakespeare in Love"") who are trying to find the truth about them.The two love stories are both really strong and have strange parallels, but are never presented in a confusing or inaccessible manner. Director Neil LaBute (Nurse Betty) told a very hard story in a very powerful way. Eckhart redeems his turn in the pathetically overrated ""Erin Brockovich"" and Paltrow yet again plays a Brit so convincingly you figure she's never coming back to America. Oh well -- at least she's good at it.",Possession
700701,"This is the second Lupin movie released by Funimation. Since the movie was made around the year 2000, all of the character designs look very modern.This movie reminded me of Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade. Fujiko is working for the man who inspired the character James Bond. That man is president of an insurance company. Once the Euro tunnel collapses, that man has to come up with the cash to pay for repairs and reconstruction. So, he and his grand daughter with the Lupin gang, go off to Southeast asia to look for some buried treasure. Treasure hunting is a concept that I believe is being overused in the Lupin movies. The entire gang is being followed and chased by a large number of Nazis who are also after the treasure of Harimao... This is a movie that is following the same formula for the same Lupins movies of the past. I would only suggest this movie if you are a die hard Lupin fan.",N/A
268987,"Yes, the one with all of them. Except that the first Doctor is recast and played very well by Richard Hurndall and Tom Baker, Doctor #4 chose not to take part. The producer bought Tom Baker many lunches and many drinks and in the end, he still refused to take part. So, bits from the unfinished story, Shada, were used for Tom's contribution.In watching this story, it's important to not have extremely high expectations. It crams a lot into a 90 minute slot (100 minutes for the extended, special edition DVD). It's best to switch off your brain and let the images hit you. All of the Doctors are in fine form, and it's especially nice to have the lovely Patrick Troughton recreating the 2nd Doctor, since there is so little that exists from his original run as the Doctor in the late '60s. It's just a big celebration of Doctor Who and all (well, many) have been invited.The Special edition works just fine and the new visual effects are a real enhancement to the story, in my opinion. None of the changes have drastically altered the story. In some cases, they have improved the feel of the story. For example, the voice of Rassilon has been enhanced in such a way that one believes that he is the most important figure in Time Lord history, rather than the game show host that was in the original version.This first DVD is light on features, like the UK release. I was rather pleased that the US release got the commentary with Peter Davison and Terrance Dicks. They seem to have fond memories of the program, along with a few disappointments and frustrations.I enjoyed the DVD enormously and hope that the Doctor Who releases on DVD continue.",Doctor Who - The Five Doctors VHS
242295,"If your idea of entertainment is to see how the rich, young and beautiful can be brought low, then this is the movie for you!Beautiful and then-dewey Jami Gertz, Andrew McCarthy Robert Downey Jr. portray 18-year-olds whose ties to society, each other and their own futures all are compromised in one way or another by the heavy drug use by two of them.Thus we are witness to betrayal, degradation, despair, longing and ultimately tragedy as the three attempt to come to terms with the neglect and carelessness that has brought their friendships - and their lives - to the brink.It may be hard, however, for mainstream audience members to feel much pity for the three spoiled-rotten rich kids as so much of what is wrong with their lives seems their own fault.True, their parents are not perfect, but few of them are.The three close friends apparently spent their youths united against the cruel torments of their rich, indifferent parents.Gertz and McCarthey's characters are high school students in love, but after he leaves for college, she holds out only for...oh...  weeks...before bedded their buddy, Downey.We see guilt, betrayal, thwarted love. Things go from bad to schmaltzy as the characters engage in cryptic conversations. Their dialogue shows them to be cool and they are always impeccably dressed, but apparently engaging in actual dialogue would be uncool, so mostly they engage in faux-witty banter.We don't quite understand what is at the core of the angst Gertz and McCarthy evidence. Maybe they felt it was the thing to do, but it makes for boring filmmaking.Downey turns in a much better performance, although many unanswered questions remain about his character as well. Was part of his seduction with Gertz really a thwarted wish to have a sexual relationship with McCarthy? Or to get even with him somehow for moving ahead with his life and leaving the two of them behind?Whatever the reason, his guilt and pain send him on a cocaine binge that has Downey exiled by his family and agreeing to prostitute himself for cocaine. Here, James Spader turns in a chilling small turn as the dealer who seems to enjoy witnessing Downey's degradation.While we can sympathize with Downey - particularly in light of the sad true-live addiction that has stunted his career and repeatedly put him in trouble with the law - sympathy is not to be had forGertz or McCarthy.They come across soley as cold, self-centered and the sort of kids you basically just wanted bad things to happen to.For instance, during one scene, when a girl's nose starts bleeding because her habitually cocaine habit has actually eroded the carilage in her nose, she only giggles and says ""rusty pipes"" as she dabs at the blood. Gertz just looke on, saying nothing.It's no surprise to the audience that there is no happy ending here. At the end, we are left to hope that the startling finality of death, witnessed close up, will lead some of the characters to a new start.That, in any case, rang sadly true.Lady Fushia",Less Than Zero VHS
725899,"The story takes place in three different locations.  In the family home of Charlize Theron and Stuart Townsend's characters where Theron is held captive by Kevin Bacon.  The second is a in a hotel room where Townsend is being held by Courtney Love, and the third is a cabin in the woods where the daughter is held by a slightly slow man. All are separated for 24 Hours. (Which was the shooting title of the film and the title of the book by Greg Iles.)One of the weeker points in the film is how imformation travels between Theron and Townsends characters.  How Townsend ends up with some information is not explained to the fullest unless you already know the story from reading the book.The other is the experamentle if not highly erratic camera movements.  In the scene where Theron's daughter is taken and she is confronted by Bacon in her house.  The camera is everywhere and you are left with a feeling of motion sickness.  This is done I beleive to put you right in Theron's shoes and it works you feel at the end just as paniced and confussed as she does.  This camerawork continues throughout the film with out the same results and after a while it becomes very annoying.What Trapped does have going for it though is the acting of Theron, Bacon, and Townsend(who does his best to hold up his end of the film while Love pulls it under).  It also has a relatively good script which was penned by the books author Greg Iles.  It has some good action sequences and Dakota Fanning proves herself again as one of one of the top child actors. (Fanning was previously scene in I Am Sam.)  Thankfully the movie doesn't stray far from the novel, which is a common problem in Hollywood.  However I do not beleive it was wise of the director to leave out the part of Bacon killing the neighbour and to change the motive for his actions, they made his character to soft by doing this and the film would have been served better if it had been not tampered with at all.All in all the movie is okay.  But the of course the book is much better.  When will hollywood learn to stop meadling?",N/A

You can go to specific titles, or hit the highlights with the Top 10 Jukebox - great for jumping into the CD.A brand new Schoolhouse Rock is included - ""I'm gonna send your vote to college"" about the Electoral College. It's interesting and in the style of our favorites, but it lacks some of the pizzazz of the originals.

720639,"but better than what I've seen of the 1st season. Hard Battle had some great eps(particularly the ep where Ranma becomes a girl mentally as well as physically) so it's a hard act to follow, but most long-running series hit a rut or two. I actually prefer the new English male Ranma voice actor, but then I love him as Inu-Yasha also(So Viz is following Japan using the same voice actor for both roles). I understand where those who don't like the change are coming from--I always check both vocal tracks &amp; often prefer the Japanese actors. Heaven knows DBZ's changed enough actors &amp; I know we'll be hearing a new Excel on the 4th Volume of Excel Saga(When my daughter complains about the prospect, I point out there've been 3 English Sailor Moon actresses &amp; 3 Son Goku in DBZ, not counting DB)I don't care for Principal Kuno, although my daughter loved his bits(she also loves Happosai...).The new teacher ep was interesting &amp; the Ranma-gets-weak set is good. I've read 13 of the graphic novels so I know much of it's from the manga, but a few details were changed such as in the manga Principal Kuno offering the get-out-of-haircut-card to whoever located his long-lost son who is quickly revealed as Tatewaki Kuno. The game show ep was much better in the manga--the anime maybe is more like tv game shows, but the manga had a running sub-plot that the people running the contest didn't want anyone to win because they couldn't really afford the prize &amp; the contests were less annoying.

187934,"I had heard rumors about this somewhat obscure film, but nobody who had seen it could remember the title.  Finally, one day I stumbled upon it @ Amazon.com.  With great excitement I ordered it immediately, nor did it end up being unworthy of my anticipation.The film centers around the epoch of Richard Phillips Feynman's courtship of and marriage to his 1st wife, Arline.  As such, it also touches upon Feynman's ""vocation"" during World War II, which was being an active member of the Manhattan Project in Los Alamos, New Mexico.The book is mostly based on Feynman's book called WHAT DO YOU CARE WHAT OTHER PEOPLE THINK? [ISBN: 0393320928, also available @ Amazon.com].  The book is highly recommended for all persons who have an interest in viewing this movie.  There are also a few tidbits from SURELY YOU'RE JOKING MR. FEYNMAN [ISBN: 0393316041] and John Archibald Wheeler's GEONS, BLACK HOLES AND QUANTUM FOAM [ISBN: 0393319911].  Both of these latter books are highly recommended to the Feynman enthusiast as well.The story of Feynman's sublime and fervent love that he felt for his terminally ill wife is nothing short of inspiring. As the great physicist has for many years been one of my most admired personages, it is without embarrassment that I admit this to be one of the few films that has ever made me cry.  Even viewers who have never heard of this scientist would be hard-pressed not to be moved by this film.As a bonus, the film does a good job of incorporating on the margins Feynman's dad, little sister, Joan (who earned a Ph.D. in physics herself from Syracuse university), John Archibald Wheeler, Hans Bethe, a young Henry Bethe and Robert Oppenheimer.The handful of verbal over-lays are well-placed and do not get in the way of the film's symmetry.  Although Broderick has never been one of my favorite actors, he pulled off his portrayal of a young Feynman quite well (if you ignore the fact that his New York accent is a bit inconsistent).  It would be nice to see more movies like this in the future.",N/A

681723,"I only rented THE HUNCHBACK OF NOTRE DAME II because the previews reminded me of my relationship with a close friend. That part of the movie stood up. Unfortunately, that's about all the movie has going for it. The story revolves around Quasimodo. Several years have passed since the end of Disney's HUNCHBACK. Esmerelda and Phoebus are married and have a son, Zephyr (Haley Joel Osment). The boy has become Quasi's best friend. Paris' annual celebration of love is about to occur and Quasi is feeling lonely.

82949,"Lilo and Stitch doesn't quite have that ""Disney magic"" which is found in Sleeping Beauty, Mary Poppins, and such, but it is nonetheless a very good family movie.Lilo is a lonely girl who is from a broken home (the parents are dead and the older sister tries to keep the two together). She is a social outcast who takes solace in her apparently antique collection of Elvis LPs. Her characterization is the most interesting in the whole film; a small child who has distinctly adult attitudes. She adopts a dog, which is really a funky space creature and an outcast in his own right. Stitch is a drooling, snarling genetic mutant that learns from Lilo, the value of himself and the importance of family.The story line moves away from the standard fairy tale fare that is the cornerstone of Disney films, and follows a dysfunctional family for a change. Indeed, Disney marketing blatantly represented Stitch as the black sheep of the animation family. The Ugly Duckling and the importance of family (""no one is left behind"") are the core themes of the movie, and it does an acceptable job of turning these elements into a happy ending.The animation is unique in that the figures are roundish, in sort of a Pillsbury Doughboy fashion, and the direct opposite of what Disney did with Hercules. This non-threatening approach to animation helps offset some action scenes that may be scary for younger children. Nevertheless, this is good entertainment for the family, and a must for anyone who wants to see an animated space alien wear an Elvis jumpsuit.",Lilo & Stitch

The storyline and editing are choppy, dull, and annoying (as if it's a mainstream movie that's attempting to be arthouse), and for some reason, Anderson's character isn't quite believable. Above all, though, it's a story about a woman who a) is a bit dim, b) is selfish, and c) is unable to communicate with her friends or ask for simple assistance when she's in trouble. I couldn't figure that one out - is she really stupid, or can't she swallow her pride for five seconds? I may seem harsh, but sincerely, who wants to watch a movie (that isn't a comedy) about someone who's selfish and stupid?

4100,"This series of four documentaries are different from most Civil War films in that they highlight specific points of four battles, whereas most documentaries are content simply to provide an overview of the battle itself.  Because of this, each episode contains many little-known facts about the battles of Antietam, Cold Harbor, Shiloh, and Gettysburg.  And, at an hour long (more or less), they are not excessively long.The highlights from each of the battles are interesting, but probably only so for someone interested in the war.  Watching an hour-long reenactment of the wheat field at Gettysburg is probably meaningless without at least some appreciation of what was happening at the other parts of the battle.  Anyone who studies the Civil War closely will appreciate these little-known facts, but casual viewers may find it a bit much.In addition to its narrow scope, these four documentaries are riddled with errors that should have been obvious to the folks at the History Channel.  For example, saying General Grant was in charge of the Union Army at Gettysburg is just plain false, as any amateur historian should know.

What is it with this man and animal decapitations?People invariably respond in one of two ways. Either they are horribly put off (as I am), or they say ""well, we eat cows, so what's wrong with hacking up a buffalo for our entertainment?""The difference is this: one is for survival. The other is for fun.And that's all I'll say. Those of you who agree with me, please stand up for your beliefs. Don't pad Coppola's pockets with your $14.95. Steal the movie, pirate it, or just don't bother. Send a clear message to arrogant directors that there are such things as special effects, animatronics and props that will acheive the same degree of realism without loss of life. Don't subsidize this kind of trash any longer.",N/A
109643,"After the disastrous, albeit entertaining, career ending flop of The Swarm, producer/director Irwin Allen returned to his roots and created a sequel to the classic thriller that practically started it all.  Sadly Beyond the Poseidon Adventure is more silly fun than suspenseful thrill ride.After loosing his valuable, career saving cargo, tugboat captain Michael Caine needs to find money and fast.  Find it he does when he happens upon the rescue of the five survivors of the recently capsized S.S. Poseidon.  Caine and company (Karl Malden and the embarrassing overacting Sally Field) arrive just before philanthropist Telly Savalas and his team of 'paramedics'.  The two teams form an uneasy alliance, one for the money, the other to save anymore trapped within the rapidly sinking liner.  But Savalas has far more sinister motives and, when their escape route is cut off, the battle for survival continues as more people are discovered alive.Unlike the first film, Irwin Allen fails to build any sort of realism in the farfetched story.  The characters are two dimensional at best, and the set and production design of the film is strictly of the Voyage to the Bottom of the Sea television series level.  The clean, cavernous, and well lit soundstage sets look just like clean, cavernous, and well lit soundstage sets.  Not once did I feel like anyone was in any real danger in the story.  Irwin Allen wisely left directing after this movie, but it was too late to salvage his career, or resurrect the genre he so masterfully exploited.  Strictly for bad movie fans.",N/A

Not since Seinfeld has a comedy been so true to life.A much overlooked comedy, this is easily one of my top five movies of all time.  Every time I watch this movie it cracks me up more and more.  I find something new with every viewing, such as someones particular body language, or just a little comment.  Plus, it's a very quotable movie, with lines like &quot;Did you get the memo?&quot; and &quot;O-face&quot; that my friends and I still use to this day.If you are a cubicle jockey like the rest of us, then you will laugh out loud during this movie...the film just hits the bulls-eye every time.

Since Abba is NEVER to going to reunite and perform again as a group; shouldn't their next DVD be an &quot;In-Concert&quot; movie?  I am sure that there must be enough film footage to make a truly good DVD.

693212,"I rate this film 6 stars out of 5.  The effects and action sequences are dazzling!  (For comparison, Episode I deserves 4 stars overall, at the most.)The Star Wars universe compares very favorably with any mythologies or fantasies I know, including JRR Tolkien's.  I'd indeed argue that Lucas's double trilogy is much bigger and far more interesting than all of Tolkien's books combined.  And the movies are also one level above anything contrived by Peter Jackson (although his films are entertaining in their own right).  I'd bet that if Tolkien were alive today to see Lucas's films, he'd be swept off his feet (or fall off his seat).  To combine grand mythology, science fiction, morality tale, and psychological drama in this perfectly balanced brew is too much for anyone even with Tolkien's brilliance to beat.  And the special effects are just state-of-the-art!  Shakespeare may have been the hottest writer in Elizabethan times, but Lucas is the greatest creative, artistic genius alive today.",N/A
541050,"Planet of the Apes is visually alluring, but not cinematically fulfilling. Burton presents a world that is overwhelmingly dark, both in tone (humans are slaves, the apes their masters) and color (the jungles are dark, the villages are dark, even the apes are dark). In a summer action flick like this, where you expect it to be fun and enjoyable, heavy themes are most effective when they're subtle. But POTA just whacks you on the head with the prejudice theme and continues to do so for the better part of the two hour film. It rarely cracks a joke and passes on the numerous opportunities to poke fun at itself and the POTA franchise. Instead, Burton spends the first two thirds of the film establishing how humans are treated like animals. It is, of course, supposed to be ironic and reflective of the way humans treat animals. But talk about overdoing it! Just to be sure you get it, there is a sequence where a young ape chooses a young girl to be her pet (sheesh!).Now, I welcome dark and edgy themes as much as the next brooding film buff, especially from a filmmaker like Burton. But the visuals take such priority in POTA that the rest of the film suffers as a result. The storyline is barely existent. The characters are dull and one-dimensional. And the ending - not the cliffhanger ending (more on that later) but the climactic-battle ending - is a total sell out. C'mon, a ""savior"" drops in from the sky and suddenly the apes see the error of their ways??? Deus ex machina, anyone?Burton has shown himself to be a great filmmaker and an even better storyteller. We watch his films to be thrilled and excited and scared by his exotic worlds and his wild and wonderful characters.  Don't expect any of that here.There is ONE thing I liked about the story: the origin of the apes. Nothing too original or amazing, but I was pleasantly surprised. The rest is horrible. Especially, the surprise ""let's-leave-you-hanging-cause-there's-going-to-be-a-sequel"" ending, which I assume is supposed to ""blow your mind.""""Re-imagining"" indeed. Except it has no imagination.",N/A
532376,"Unbreakable is a revelation in commercial filmmaking. The director, M.Night Shyamalan aimed to combine art house flamboyance with mainstream sensibilities, and as a result has made one of the most misunderstood and underrated films of the last decade.The film possesses a strict style. It is slowly paced, acted with a subdued ambiguity and shot in a cold and obstinate manor. Kubrick's visual legacy lives on in every frame of this film.I love the fact that most critic's disregarded it as a pretentious experiment. Taxi Driver, Raging Bull and The Lost Weekend were poorly reviewed for the same reason upon release but are now considered masterpieces. Unbreakable will begin to be realised for what it truly is; a complex, multi-faceted allegory. It poses one of the hardest questions we could ever ask ourselves: 'what was I put on this earth to do?'For ninety-eight minutes Bruce Willis is on a voyage like Travis Bickle, searching for his identity, wanting to make a change in his life and the world that surrounds him.Bruce Willis is perfectly cast as David Dunn, a man whose potential has not yet been realised. Willis may continue to make average action films but every now and again he reminds us all of his acting talents. Obviously this performance was TOO good for the Academy. Robin Wright Penn and Sam Jackson excel in their parts, but ultimately this is Willis's show.Unbreakable continues to be a rewarding cinematic experience. I respect the director for his intelligence but also his courage to make an atypical Hollywood movie that holds up the mirror to our souls and begs us to ask the same question.The DVD itself is a combination of disappoinments and surprises. The picture and sound quality is exceptional, putting other film transfers (i.e. Shawshank and The Godfather) to shame. The cinematography and musical score are equally sublime and it is fitting that this DVD does its best to showcase that....This featurette reveals new aspects of the film that I never noticed before. It entertained and informed me, which really makes this an excellent piece of material to watch.The ""Comic Book and Superheroes Documentary"" is flat out brilliant. We learn about the conventions of villains, heroes and the themes in comic books. It illuminates Unbreakable to the point where you watch the film in an entirely new perspective.Then you have the seven deleted scenes. The director introduces each one and explains why they were removed from the final cut. The quality of both the scenes and introductions are first-rate, and reveals just how good a filmmaker Shyamalan is.Then there is ""An Excerpt From a Childhood Film of M. Night Shyamalan"" It is so charming to see a director at the age of ten (or whatever) making his own short film. It of course is terrible but is now all the more significant considering where that young boy is today.The ""Train Station Sequence with Multi-Angle Feature & Sound Mix"" is kinda cool. We have seen it with the Seven and Fight Club DVDs. It reveals the effect sound has on images, and also the opportunity to see the scene drawn out in storyboards shows just how professional Hollywood can be!Ultimately though what is lacking is a filmmakers' commentary. Like Spielberg, Shyamalan does not like commentating on his films which is fair enough, but surely this did not stop the other cast and crew members from commenting on the production. Commentaries are the most valued and significant extras any DVD can offer, and it really is a shame not to find at least one on this ""Special Edition"" DVD. Quite frankly I would have preferred a commentary to the gorgeous packaging and 2 Collectable Alex Ross Illustrations.",Unbreakable
496906,JACKIE IS ONLY IN 30 MINUTES OUT OF THE WHOLE FILM!  Though it is still a good film! it's about this cop who goes undercover in a prison to find out who ordered the assasination of his father-in-law.

364550,"I first saw this movie as a young child. It continued to be one of my favorites all my life. Since first seeing this movie, I have been exposed to countless thousands of movies, everything from Kurosawa to Orson Welles and John Ford. But Fantasy and Sci-Fi have always been my favorite kind of movies. Amazingly, rather than degrade with time, this movie just gets better and better. Why? Well first of all, the plot is the often used but always great story of a boy on a quest to save the world. It worked in Star Wars, it worked in Dune, it worked in every Final Fantasy game, and it works here. Secondly, the visuals are some of the best seem in any movie ever. Don't see this movie of VHS. It MUST be experienced on DVD in all its wide-screen glory. The special effects are perfect (taken right from the 80s golden age of matte paintings and blue screen before CGI destroyed the artistry of visuals). The soundtrack is one of the best in any movie ever. In short, this is in my opinion, the best movie Wolfgang Peterson ever made, and one of the greatest fantasy flicks of all time. Movies come and go, but this story remains...neverending. It is my favorite movie of all time.In my opinion, The Neverending Story is the greatest fantasy movie ever made. When it was made it was the most expensive movie ever made outside of the United States. It was also a box office flop. But like The Wizard of Oz, It's a Wonderful Life, and several modern films I could name, real genius is just a bit much for some people to take ahead of its time and all at once. There has been a lot of discussion about the book vs. the movie, and while I'm not usually a fan of modifying books heavily for the big-screen adaptation, in this case I absolutely have to make an exception. You see the thing is, while I love the movie, I don't really like the book. Michael Ende may have been right about one thing when he tried to sue the film-makers for deviating from his book: this movie is not the book in film form, it's something else entirely. There are concepts that work in books, but just don't translate to an audio/visual medium very well. I LIKE the Nothing as storm rather than as a silent consuming force. I LIKE the gate to the Southern Oracle being lethal rather than paralyzing.  The simplification and streamlining/reworking of the story to what the movie became was the RIGHT decision to make, much as it may irk purists and fans of the book. The only other movie I can think of where I approve so much of slaughtering a book's vision is The Secret of NIMH (it was actually Don Bluth's comments about what works and doesn't work in a film vs. a book in the commentary of that film that made me realize I feel The Neverending Story is SUPERIOR to the book because of the changes made). For better or worse, whether you like the deviations of the story from the book or not, the film was made the way it was. Personally I absolutely love it.""Not Atreyu the child, Atreyu the Warrior!""The emotional core of the film, the protagonist inside of the book, Atreyu, is the stuff of legend. Here we have a British actor playing a Native American archetype, a child actor playing a child warrior. When you're a kid watching this movie for the first time you never question or think about such things even for a second, and as an adult, you might like me feel amazed by the alternating extreme vulnerability and confident strength brought to the character. You have to empathize with the character, even see yourself in him as a child, while at the same time seeing that good old-fashioned hero pluck that makes you love Luke Skywalker. I really do think it's one of the great child-actor performances of all time, simply because he's not some muscle-bound action hero. He's a kid. And he's got to save the world. And you never question it for a moment. You believe it. Awesome. In an old interview I found on the net the child-actor said of the character he played ""I AM Atreyu."" I agree.""Bastian, please! Save us!""The child who plays Bastian, and the child who plays the Empress both similarly surpass themselves in playing very serious demanding roles with incredibly sincerity and believability. While Bastian plays his character the most like a normal, shy, introverted child (you can really feel his childishness and immaturity at the end of the movie when he has to choose between trying to act and live the way everyone else insists that he should (like an adult!), and doing what he really wants to in order to save an entire world). The Empress impresses despite her very short screen time by managing quite quickly to convince you despite a very young age, that she at once gravely ill, very old, and (as my dear sister Codemaster Talon put it) actually Empress of something! That super-calm serenity, deep sadness, and knowing smile (I absolutely love the look she gives Atreyu when he says he's failed [but she knows better], and the smile she starts to show when Atreyu asks why Bastian doesn't do something if he knows how to save them). Codemaster Talon also said that ""Never before was so much heavy lifting required by so many child actors."" And I'll add that never before was it been lifted so far and so well.""I never knew it was THAT beautiful.""It's fascinates me how the use of wide-screen, wide-angle camera-work results not in a kiddie-feeling movie, but in in adult, epic, emotionally powerful film. And more than that, the artwork results in mesmerizing landscapes that just have to be seen wide-screen to be believed (there is nothing like the feeling the first time you see the Ivory Tower). When Atreyu sets off on his quest and you see him ride past massive crystals and past screen-filling rainbows, over dunes and through grassy plains, you feel the distance and get swept up in the grandeur of the world that has been created.Visually this film is stunning. The painted backgrounds and wide angle shots are some of the best in any film ever made, and they combine with the music to make this one of the most beautiful films in history. The special effects are obviously reference quality, on the level of Star Wars. They aren't CGI cartoons and digitally re-touched pictures. The effects in this movie come from great craftsmanship in the old-school tradition. Miniatures, puppetry, painted backgrounds, and brilliant set design combine with amazing voice-acting, and spectacular cinematography to create a wold that is more than just fantastic, it's believable, and makes you feel that it is all REAL.The music of this movie has been debated for some time now. It seems to be very popular these days to equate ""original cut"" with ""superior film"", even if it is not necessarily the case. I don't speak German. I haven't seen the original theatrical version of this film, nor have I heard the complete original score. But I do know this: some of the most memorable music in the film came from the International version we've all seen. The theme for the Ivory Tower is one of the coolest pieces of music in film history, and it was NOT composed for the film by it's original composer. Say what you will, that's a cool piece of music that I for one am GLAD is in the movie. Regardless of re-edits and cuts and new music, the score to this film is one of the best and most memorable in movie history, and it's a sad thing indeed that the COMPLETE music for this film has never been, and possibly never will be made available. What music is playing on my computer speakers and on my MP3 players all the time. Not just good. Fantastic.I really think that this is Wolfgang Peterson's best film. I've seen a few in my time, and while some of them were pretty good, none of the ones I saw ever came close to the magic of this film. I think it was made at the zenith of his talent and ability, as was Miyazaki's Nausicaa and George Lucas' Star Wars. You can feel the idealism and courage in this film, it permeates everything.""Never give up, and good luck will find you.""Throughout my life I've seen this film as a metaphor for my own life experiences, and that's because it perfectly captures the hero's quest mythology that I love so much. I can't imagine a more frightening test than the Sphinx Gate to the Southern Oracle (whose burning eyes can see straight into your heart and fry you to a crisp in an instant from a hundred feet in the air). I can't imagine a more perfect metaphor for losing your faith in life and having it restored than drowning in the swamps of sadness only to have your life saved by a light in the sky that heralds your rescue by a Luck Dragon. And just when you think it's all over and you've completely failed, you may be surprised to know that making the journey was a victory in itself, and you always had the ability to save what's most important to you, you just had to believe it with all your heart and do something about it.With the world so full of cynicism and practicality rubbish, it feels so good to put this movie in and be reminded just for a little while that stories and dreams are, after all, far more important than silly things like reality and a world filled with hatred and despair.If you think this movie is over-rated, you may need to see it properly. It's a three star movie on a tiny TV, a four star movie wide-screen, and a five star movie on a projector with the volume cranked way up (especially since the volume on the disc is a little low). There are a few movies that I really wish I could see in a movie theater just once. I would pay $50.00 to see this film in a theater. No joke. I hope and pray that this film will one day get the remastered in high-definition, DTS, full-making of documentary, and feature length commentary with all the actors and director on a super-special edition DVD (I doubt the German version will ever be available but it sure would be nice to include it). Until then the U.S. release of this film on DVD has good sound and picture and allows everyone to enjoy a wide-screen clear transfer of this, the best fantasy film I've ever seen, and my personal favorite movie ever.",The NeverEnding Story VHS
586094,"I went to see &quot;The Musketeer&quot; expecting a fun flick with some over-the-top fight scenes.  What I got was one of the few films I have ever wanted to walk out on.  This movie is bad.I love Hong Kong action films, and I have seen many an actor fly across the screen in wire-fu action.  Xin Xin Xiong is billed as a &quot;legendary&quot; fight master even though this is only the 3rd film he has choreographed.  A quick check shows that most of Xin Xin Xiong's career has been as an extra in various Jet Li films.  The ladder scene is remarkably similar to a scene in  &quot;Once Upon a Time in China.&quot; (Which was choreographed by Woo-ping Yuen of &quot;The Matrix&quot; and &quot;Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon&quot; fame.)  The rope scene on the tower is just silly.  (Why not just cut the ropes?) Hardly a &quot;legendary&quot; fight master.The acting is a bad as any I have ever seen.  Tim Roth, who is usually great, sleepwalks through the film.  What Justin Chambers does cannot really be called acting.  There is no plot.Yikes!  I could go on!  Rent at your own risk.

177495,"The Stargate SG-1 Season 1 Box Set is a great introduction to this excellent sci-fi series. Although the first season had its share of clunkers (as is only normal with any new series trying to find its footing), SG-1 succeeded in quickly establishing its characters and unique plotlines, and definitely had a much better first year than most series.While I do feel that the few aforementioned bad episodes were among the series' all-time worst (most notably, &quot;Emancipation&quot; and &quot;Brief Candle&quot;), these are easily excused since the high quality of most of the rest of the season more than makes up for it.Among my personal favorites of the first season:Children Of The Gods: A great follow-up to the movie, introducing us to characters both old and new. Lots of action and great special effects. My only complaint with the pilot episode is the inclusion of gratuitous and unnecessary nudity in the scene in which Sha're is possessed by the Goa'uld Amonet.Thor's Hammer: The series' first mention of the Asgard, who will become a major ally for Earth in later seasons. Also introduces the first ones, the Unas.The Torment Of Tantalus: A moving and awe-inspiring episode dealing with loneliness and the thirst for new scientific discoveries.Enigma: SG-1 rescues a few members of the Tollan race, who are vastly technologically superior to Earth but refuse to share their knowledge. Also introduces SG-1's NID nemesis, Colonel Maybourne.There But For The Grace Of God: Still one of my all-time favorite SG-1 episodes, this outing finds Daniel Jackson transported to a frightening alternate universe in which Earth is under attack from a devastating Goa'uld onslaught!Within The Serpent's Grasp: One of the show's best season-ending cliffhangers, in which SG-1 defy orders and risk all to prevent a vicious attack on Earth by Apophis.All in all, Stargate SG-1's first season did a great job in setting the tone and groundwork for the incredible years to follow.

560323,"Tokyo Raiders is a text book example of what Hong Kong cinema produces, and depending on your taste, it can be an eye candy  or annoyance. Hit or miss, it never stops trying to entertain you.The story is basically about three Chinese in Japan, raising hell and spoiling the bad guys.  In between, there are fights, explosion, and of course, car chases. However, since pop stars Ekin Cheng and Kelly Chen needs to protect their squeaky clean image, there is no naked woman where one normally finds in an American production. But Tony Leung's large quantity of beautiful assistants do somewhat make up for it.This film is all about gadgets, plot twist, and style.  With much emphasis on the later. It's rapid-fire MTVism editing even  outdone MTV itself. And probably needed to hide the fact that neither Leung nor Cheng knows any kung fu in real life.  But I like it.

588589,"The Man Who Wasn't There is a beautiful piece of movie making, and one of the best Coen brothers films, coming close second to their masterpiece Fargo.It is a Film Noir par excellence, beautifully shot in black and white, adding a lot of atmosphere, and enhancing the 50s mood where the film is set.The story is simple, a small time barber with a dull life, loses his dream of making it big in the new business venture of 'dry cleaning', dicovers his wife is cheating, kills his wife's lover, she is framed for the murder, and he is about to get away with it, but is caught and put on the chair..quite simple story, but with the Coen brothers, it becomes a very original film, and in my opinion, better than their first release, Blood Simple, another Film Noir Classic.The secret lies in their masterful direction, the cinematography, and of course the brilliant acting. Billy Bob Thorton is wonderful, and although says little, his facial expressions speak volumes, and Tony Shalhoub is marvellous as the fast talking big shot lawyer.What I believe adds to the film, is the music as well, and using Beethoven's sonata adds a lot of poignacy to the film.So The Man Who wasn't There is a beautiful film, from very talented moviemakers.",N/A
558447,"This, along with other short series'(i.e. Fawlty Towers), is ideal for DVD since the buyer won't go broke buying just a few sets and it isn't likely that shows with a just a few episodes are going to turn up on televison very often (Police Squad comes to mind). But what do we have here in this first set of The Prisoner?In set 1, we have the classic first episode &quot;Arrival&quot; in which Patrick McGoohan, playing a character known only as Number 6, awakens to find himself in a strange place--almost a vacation resort (known only as The Village) that seems to have everything that its inhabitants desire---except freedom to leave.  I love the opening to each episode with the great music and on &quot;Arrival&quot; we're given an even longer introduction to the show that you won't see again on any of the other episodes.  Why is No. 6 here? Who is in charge? These are questions that he desperately wants answers to and soon learns that he was brought there so that those in charge could find out why he resigned from some sort of government intelligence position. From the beginning, he refuses to play along and this provides the basic backdrop for every episode. His adversary (a different No. 2 in most episodes) must come up with new and persuasive ways to get that information out of him.In the next epsiode, &quot;Free for All&quot;, a village election is being held and many are curious to see if No. 6 is interested in participating.  &quot;Dance of the Dead&quot; involves an eerie masquerade and criminal charges against No. 6.  There are a few neat extras, including an alternate version of &quot;The Chimes of Big Ben&quot;. The standard episode is one of the best of the series but the problem with the alternate version is poor sound and picture quality. I assume there was nothing that could have been done to improve it, otherwise they would have. There's also a large photo gallery, trivia game, and original TV trailers.

539774,"The Bourne Identity is a solid, efficient, old-fashioned thriller that gives us everything we could want in a summer shoot-'em-up. Robert Ludlum's ingenious original story--he made Jason Bourne COMPLETELY alone, hunted by the police and his own colleagues alike, without even memory to help him--is given swift, streamlined treatment by director Doug Liman, with plenty of explosions, assassinations, car chases and double-crosses to keep us on the edge of our seats. Matt Damon gives an assured, charismatic performance as Bourne, his weathered baby face giving the character a certain poignancy without detracting in the slightest from his credibility. He's nobody's male ingenue anymore! German actress Franka Potente lives up to her last name: she's a potent and sexy screen presence, not particularly pretty but far more alluring than many women who are. And it's interesting to see Chris Cooper, normally typecast as a nice guy, give such a thoroughly creepy performance as Bourne's treacherous CIA boss.

To me there seems to be no grandeur about this film besides the isle of Cephalonnia itself.  The music is unmemorable, much of the acting (e.g. John Hurt) is uncommitted, and even the cinematography seems unambitious in its scale.  I found myself caring nothing for the two lead characters, but perhaps I resented an American being cast as an Italian and a Hispanic cast as a Greek.  This is an enormous, wasted opportunity -- no wonder author Louis de Bernieres refused to have anything to do with the movie once he realised what the production team intended.  On the plus side, I cannot fault Cage for the effort put into his mandolin-playing and Cruz for the effort she put into her acting.

I was very surprised to see that the majority of the movie's vignettes were produced by Walt himself before his death. I have never read any other the original stories by A.A. Milne, but judging by what I have heard this film does justice to the original classic tales.The film offers simplistic animation, becuase of budget or artistic integrity - - I do not know.  I assume it's the latter becuase the art works perfectly. The art looks just like drawings would look in an old English children's book.This is indeed probably one of the few Disney classics that children 2 years and under could watch all the way through without having to skip over an evil witch, or a pirate, which are too intense for toddlers. For parents, this film is far from the worst thing you could sit through. It's actually not bad at all.

However the characters seemed very one dimensional and did not interact well and seemed unbelievable at times.  That said the action sequences are very good, just what you would expect.  Loud, in your face, fast and the chase scene at the end is almost like a queue of stuntmen and directorrs all having 3 minutes to outdo each other as the finale becomes more frantic, outrageous and improbable utilising every type of vehicle the production people could get their hands on.But these scenes are made for DVD to play over and over, and coupled with enough extras to keep even a region 2 fan happy, it has to be said it is value for money.",N/A

When she laughs, you laugh. When she is sad, you are sad and when she is angry, you are angry. This movie is an example why the French consider movie making an art and a national tradition. This is a poignant and moving story of the strength of friendship and of jealousy. Think of spending Saturday with your girlfriend shopping and coming home to a jealous boyfriend or husband, or being upset with your boyfriend or husband because he spends endless hours discussing politics or NASCAR with his friend. This movie goes deeper but you will understand the meaning of friendship and why friends gather from and give strength to each other and of the irritating emotion of jealousy. This movie is eloquently written and superbly acted. While viewing this movie it would not be unusual to feel ambivalent emotions. The movie constantly elicits joy, seriousness, laughter, and sadness. If you do not speak French the subtitles may be disruptive. You may find yourself ocassionally reviewing the scenes to read the subtitles. But I could not take my eyes away from the screen. It is a pleasure to look at Huppert and Miou-Miou, they are beatiful and so are the clothes! This was the first French movie I have seen in a long time. Since then I have purchased other French movies. Why do French movies always make you think for a long time after you have seen it? The French are masters of this craft.",Entre Nous English subtitles  VHS

276656,"Blow-Up (Michelangelo Antonioni, 1966)Antonioni's film career, these days, is little more than a footnote in the textbooks of aspiring filmmakers and  critics. Most of his movies have already been forgotten less than a half-century after they were made. One of the exceptions is Blow-Up, which was nominated for almost as many awards  as O. J. Simpson. Watching it thirty-five years after its release, one wonders why.Much of the film's power probably had to do with its cultural context. Blow-Up, which is ostensibly about a  photographer (a very young David Hemming, later to not achieve the great fame he should have for his role in Profondo Rosso, one of the finest films ever made) who may or may not  have captured a murder on film without meaning to, was actually full of subtext about the meaning of photography in the modern world. When you realize the infamous Zapruder film was released at around the same time andviewable by those in the know, the questions get a lot more compelling. At least they did to those who theorized  endlessly about a grassy knoll in Dallas in 1963. Removed from that context now, Antonioni's crowning achievement looks a bit more like Thomas' Harris novel The Silence of  the Lambs. As the book, which is mediocre at best, was carried to stardom within the context of Jonathan Demme's excellent film, Blow-Up took its cue from Zapruder.  However, while Harris' next novel showed the rest of the world that Harris was, in fact, not a writer up to par with Demme's filmmaking, Antonioni's followup (the gloriously  vapid, now largely-forgotten Zabriskie Point, a film of interest only to hardcore Pink Floyd fans-and even most of THEM find it insufferable) had no effect on the filmmaker's stature  whatsoever. Even time seems to have left Antonioni relatively unscathed, and many still see Blow-Up as a classic. I will continue to wonder what they're thinking. Both Hemming  and co-star Vanessa Redgrave seem somewhat lost in their parts, various gratuitous nude scenes are thrown in for what seems to be shock value more than anything, the  Yardbirds make a pointless cameo, and what is actually on the roll of film that everyone's so concerned about never captures the viewer's attention nearly as much as it captures  the attentions of everyone else. Sometimes this technique works. Here, it doesn't. * ",N/A
537224,"For the most part, Pearl Harbor holds true to the actual events of that fateful day in 1941, but unfortunately the historical depiction takes a back seat to the typical love triangle that seems to be in fashion these days, as if, like Titanic, the historical recreation of a story to which most viewers already know the ending must have something of interest to draw people to the box office.Although the battle sequences of the actual attack on Ford Island are spectacular and seamless, I found laughable the idea that Ben Afleck and Josh Hartnett not only single-handedly drove off the first wave of Japanese warplanes, but also managed to find time to make it to one of the on-base hospitals to donate a couple of pints of blood for the wounded before dashing off to end their hectic day on the hull of the Arizona, assisting with the rescue efforts. Whew! I'm glad these guys were on our side!Alas, the film doesn't quite know what it is: a documentary of a ""day that will live in infamy"", or a sappy love story set against a backdrop of WW II. Many WW II war buffs, not to mention veterans, will be disappointed, despite the film's accuracy; but then, this segment of the movie-going market is dwindling. Pearl Harbor seems geared toward young people who swoon over the two male co-stars and watch to find out which one wins the girl, with nary a care that the men who fought and died in this battle and all of the battles in WW II helped shape the world in the second half of the 20th century as well as the early part of the 21st century. For my money, Saving Private Ryan, although the story's premise was purely fiction, was a much better film because it more accurately depicted the horrors of war.Four stars for the attempt to accurately depict the events leading up to the attack on Pearl Harbor, but overall, one star for relegating our parent's 9/11 to the background of a tacky love triangle.",N/A
340095,"House of Dracula is an enjoyable classic monster film. Onslow Stevens is quite good as the compassionate, but mis-guided scientist who trys to ""cure"" Dracula, the Wolf Man and The Frankenstein Monster as well as his lovely, but Hunchedbacked, assistant, the ravishing Jane Adams. Quite an ambitious agenda for one film! The results are mixed, Dracula can't stop preying on pretty nurses and is dispatched by the good doctor. However Dracula, played very well by John Carradine, reverses a transfusion and curses the doctor with some of his blood. The doctor performs an operation and cures Lon Chaney Jr. of the Werewolf curse. Tragically, Dracula's blood turns the good doctor to evil and he revives the Frankenstein Monster and kills his pretty nurse before he is gunned down by the now ex-Wolfman. Lionel Atwill (always a welcome addition to these films!) is electrocuted by Frankenstein before the monster is consumed in the flames of the laboratory. This movie whatever its faults certainly doesn't drag!! All this and more happens in a brisk 70 minutes. What I don't understand is why Universal hasn't released ""House of Dracula"" on DVD with its other classic monster films? I have the VHS tape above as well as the Laserdisc release of 1995. Both show a print that is quite well preserved. So where is the DVD Universal???????? I would like to complete my collection~and get a few more as gifts!! My brother and I watched these as kids growing up, far better than the often sexually explicit ""Slasher Flicks"" that today's pre-teens are watching!! When our parents were that age movies like ""House of Dracula"" were what they watched at the Saturday afternoon Matinee.  I am sure they would also love to see it again as well.  I can only hope that Universal ""digs it up"", before the next full moon or at least in the near future for a DVD release!",N/A

I reccomend this film to anyone who can appreciate a great movie.  Oh, and to those parents who are wondering why the film was rated NC-17, it is not that inappropriate.

It's one of the funniest movies I've seen in a very long time.The opening seen is hilarious. Peter (played by Ron Livingston), who is stuck in a traffic jam finds himself making less forward progress than an old man with a walker. That's the kind of day Peter's day seems to begin every day with something going wrong.From there Peter goes to his job as a computer technological company where he always has issues with the boss and the damn copying machine which never seems to work.When Peter and his friends are frustrated and upset about work their boss says they must have ""a case of the Mondays."" Then they go to the shop next door and order coffee and ask the waitress (played by Diedrich Bader), what she would say if someone told you ""I think I have the case of the Mondays?"" The waitresses reply: HILARIOUS!!!Michael Bolton, a friend of Peter's, comes up with a ""genius"" plan to make them millionaires in a matter of a few years while screwing their company.Overall this is a great hilarious and humorous movie with great acting (especially Peter and Milton) that will make you laugh.I have seen this movie twice and I love it!

668512,"Three men (one of whom is a cop) each have an encounter with a sexy woman named Jewel (Tyler) in a bar named McCools, and then recount their experiences to each other- not knowing that it is the same girl, who also has a knack for theft and sets about ripping them off with the aid of her hairy, tattooed, mulleted partner in crime. Jewel's second favourite thing in the world is water. Numero Uno is, not surprisingly; doing the WILD THANG!! The motives of the men (played by John Goodman, Matt Dillon and Paul Reiser) for pursuing Jewel are varied. See if you can match up the reason with the actor. 1 guy is a cop and knows she's a thief, another is in it for the nookie and the last guy worships the ground Jewel walks on, sad fool that he is. You don't have to be a brain surgeon to figure it out. Despite a good cast ONE NIGHT AT McCOOLS is very repetitive and tiresome, which is sad, because Michael Douglas is excellent as usual and also co-produced the movie. As for Liv Tyler, she has never been hotter, but she keeps her bra on during the sex scenes. I hate that. It's totally unrealistic. Her dress is so tight it's amazing that her boobs don't pop out. And this movie is so predictable and obvious that it's unbelievable that the viewer's brain doesn't start leaking out of his/her ears.

The late, great Thunderfingers may have provided The Who with its stability, but Pete Townshend and Roger Daltrey are still the main attraction.

23804,"The last three Sharpe movies (unless they take a young Sharpe to India or an old Sharpe to his final adventure in South America.) are a fitting close to the series.  A lot of loose threads are cleaned up as our characters driven together by Napoleon are finally released into the world without him.SHARPE'S REVENGE closes out General Calvet, and his trusted servent Gaston, General Ross, Captian Frederickson (one of the best supporting characters in the series) and of course Major Ducos who is the classic foe for Sharpe.  It is a story well acted and visually satisfying.  In terms of story it is the best of the three.  The transformation of Sharpe's wife begins here and is superior to the book as it builds on the previous movie which was an origional story.  Since she avoids tempation only by the aid of Harris (who's absence along with Hagman is painful)her failure becomes credible.SHARPE'S JUSTICE gives us a peacetime Sharpe and Harper trying to adapt to a peacetime life.  The loss of Harris is made up to some degree by the return of Caroline Langrishe as Lady Anne ( much more interesting than his French lady )and the addition of Philip Glenister as Truman.  I have now seen Glenister in two period pieces of that time (the 2nd being as Hobbs in the latest Hornblower movies)and he seems born to it.The plot is interesting and different as Sharpe finds himself in a situation and an enviorment that he is unable to cope with.  It isn't done as well as it could be, but I think this is due to the script and plot more than the acting.  The scenes concerning Sharpe's wife are totally contrived.  They are the only reason this set fails to get five stars.  As the picture come sans the war the action level is also down, but we expect this so it hurts very little.  Worth a watch, just fast forward over Sharpe's wife  (unless she is with Lady Anne) after the first viewing.SHARPE'S WATERLOO is a spectacle and a tough one.  It is the most fameous battle in European history and the battle scenes almost steal the entire show.  In terms of character development it is grand.  Jane finally becomes the full fledged villian of the piece and she and her lover are played to perfection.  The Prince of Orange fails the villany test as his errors are mostly of stupidity until the very end.Harper is actually more interesting than Sharpe in this one, and the return of the team of Harris & Hagman is great (""Prusians ahh"").  It is the only one of the Sharpe movies where the battle drives the characters and not vice versa.  This is due to Waterloo's place in British history.  Waterloo is the star and all of the characters are caught in its pull driven toward Europe's and their own climax.Quite a finish.","Sharpe's Collection Set 3: Sharpe's Revenge, Sharpe's Justice & Sharpe's Waterloo VHS"

695710,"It's a wonderful film, high in its characterizations and interactions.  Here's the lowdown on the film as far as genre, content and art style.Genre: Drama/Sci-Fi.  It is more a drama than a Science Fiction, though it contains elements of Sci-fi, unexplainable technology and distant future/alternate dimenional settings.  It is mainly a drama pitted together in a horrible situation.Artstyle: Realistic, similar to the Gundam Series, Princess Mononoke, Vampire Hunter D.  Lacks the common anime features: exaggerated facial expressions (blown up eyes, river size tear trails), exaggerated bodily features (larger than life breasts, muscles where muscles just aren't).Violence:  High level.  Bloody corpse, blood.  Brutality, cruel behavior.  It suggests rape twice and shows an attempt at rape.  There is no needless violence, every notion of violence has an emotional and psychological impact on the characters.  The rape scenes follow in the same pattern.  This is a tasteful film which paces its violent scenes in full context with the story and the development of the characters and their situation.  Not suggested for young children.Setting: In foreign land/world/time (described as the distant future by many sources).  Postapocolyptic, during a great war.  World is under an extreme drought, water is very valuable (this is a main issue in the film but does not superscede the situations of the characters.Themes: Finding ones place in life; Doing what is expected Versus Doing what is right; Survival; The value of Life.Jist: I don't know what it is with the Japanese and Guys with sticks helping a helpless girl (ICO for example).  You have a guy saving a girl.  From the beginning until the end this is what it is mainly about, though involving many other characters.I find the most important element of this film to be its characters.  They are so diverse in their own way; there aren't a hundred different characters but each comes from a setting, sometimes similar with others, but they all have completely different situations.  A lot of the situations start from one main point: being forced into another way of living.  The way they deal with it and their exact way of living is different.  Shu's situation is the main focus, as is obvious from the beginning of the film.  After becomming invovled with Lala-ru he is determined to help her.  She is probably the most influencial character, every character is effected by her either directly or indirectly.  But Shu is the only one that is intent upon saving her, some even hate her.  You'll find a lot of mystery surrounding her; her name is known apparently world wide and many rumors and speculations are going around about her no one really quite knows why she is so important to the King, excpet the King (obviously) and his closest and most loyal servant Abelia.If you are an Anime fan then this should be at least viewed if not in your library.  All three are wonderfully set with 13 episodes that don't let up or fill between.  It's kinda like a 13 part OVA.  I would highly recommend this for fans of Princess Mononoke, Vampire Hunter D/bloodlust.  Young audiences may not be suitable for the violent/graphic/realistic nature of some themes and instances and these instances and themes may not even interest young audiences to begin with.  It is a movie about emotions, and they can be heavy at times.  I quickly added this to my library, give it a rent in the least.  There are many more amazing things i could say about this film, but i'd probably give it all away (it doens't have any Sixth Sense style surprises though).Everyone i know of that has seen it has loved it.  It'd adorable and powerful.  And they all loved Abelia just as much as they loved Sara","Now and Then, Here and There: Complete Collector's Boxed Set"

438143,"Rough Riders is a film that depicts one segment of the life of Theodre Roosevelt.  It is a film that is a constellation of people, some at the end of their careers and some just starting out.  It is a film that depicts the events the assault on Cuba in the Spanish-American War and the events which lead up to it and subsequent actions.  It is a film that is not about one man but a group and it is the group of actors that makes this film work so well. There are the big names, Tom Berenger, Gary Busey, an ailing Brian Keith, George Hamilton and Sam Elliott.  But there is a steller cast of supporting actors that make this ensemble work so well.We see a young and vigerous Theodore Roosevelt, anxious to serve, leave his adminsitrative post of Assistant Secretary of the Navy to assume the role of second in command of a volunteer cavalry regiment, known as the Rough Riders.  He is there to support the efforts of the commanding officer, Colonel Leonard Wood, to mold cowboys, indians, thieves and polo players into an effective fighting body.  That Wood is able to do this so well is a tribute to his leadership and the enthusiasm of Roosevelt and the men who make up the command.  Dale Dye givesa very believeable performance of this physician turned cavalry officer.We see the effective end of 19th century warfare, single shot rifles and large formations of troops facing each other and the introduction of open warfare and effective use of machine guns.  It was unfortunate that the military observers who were present in Cuba did not effectively report on the value of a machine gun to the British and French governments.This film was also a major reunification of the north and south.  Gary Busey's Joseph Wheeler is tremendous, although in actual life, Wheeler was quite short and wizened.  But it is his fighting spirit that is effectively translated to us.  In times of stress Wheeler had a tendency to forget who the enemy was and refer to the Spaniards as Yankees.  Fortunately his son and aide serves as the peace-keeper for dad's mis-statements.You see very few women in this film.  You see the men leaving their wives and girl friends to go to war, from Wood and Roosevelt to the private soldiers.  The events in Texas and Cuba are shown as almost a fraternity  and not inappropriately either.  We shouldn't make the mistake of assigning values of the 21st Century to the end of the 19th Century.  You also see an aspect of American life that is less glamerous - the segregated Army - black soldiers lead by white officers.  It may have been wrong, but that was the way it was done.  The portrayal is accurate - soldiers respecting their officers and officers respecting their men.  Officers who served in black regiments ran the risk of being seen as less effective officers than those in white regiments.  Fortunately for John Pershing, he met Roosevelt and served with him in Cuba and the latter remembered him when he was President.  One instance when service in a black regiment was beneficial.  Incidently, the black members of the Army were amongst the most experienced and skilled long service soldiers that could be put in the field.  They well showed thier skill and valor.I could go to great length and describe all the actors and thier rolls.  Suffice it to say that space precludes this.  However, all rolls are well played.  You almost get the feeling that these are professional soldiers you were watching. This extends from the military to the diplomatic to the purely commercial as we see William Randolph Hearst encouraging military intervention by sending reporters into Cuba in advance of the Army.This is a film that all who have an interest in American history should see.  It is as much a social commentary as military film.  It portrays the many aspects of the Spanish-AMerican War.  It shows well, the enthusiasm of men rushing to enlist and the disillusionment of some of the survivors as they return to empty homes where wives and children have left them.  It is a well made film that records a segment of our history, right or wrong, but events that happended.  It is well worth the rental fee.",Rough Riders VHS

It's more for people who already are familiar with the poses, who might appreciate some fine-tuning: he tells you where to look and what muscle(s) should be turning out while others turn in, etc. ... He seems quite gentle & motivating to me.Yes, he does kinda pose a bit, which is a little silly but, hey, he's got a fine body, there, so power to him. And he handles his students in class, which, combined with his posing & the artsy production quality, comes off as kinda sexy -- something I've never seen nor did I expect to see in a yoga video. At first, it was a little odd to me, but now I think it's cool. He rolls people's shoulders under & pulls on their legs during relaxation pose and, man, that looks like it'd feel good!Anyway, I think Bryan Kest's ""hands on"" yoga instructing is great, and I often try to extend my own body the way he's demonstrating on his students, and I find it helps me settle deeper into each pose. I've been doing this tape once a week for awhile now, and the time always FLIES by, and I'm always loose & refreshed when it's over. I have been challenged, but I haven't been frustrated. Cause, after all, its not about depth in a pose, but about breathing and feeling something, as Bryan reminds us throughout the tape. And, oh, you'll feel something, alright!","Bryan Kest - Power Yoga, Vol. 3 - Sweat VHS"
595181,"I hate when writers try to change a genre to fit their interpretation of how things should be. Or, let me put that another way, I hate it when writers try to change a genre to fit their interpretation of how things should be and do a horrible job of it. Personally, if someone wants to break new ground, I'm all for it, that's how we learn and discover new things. But M. Night Shyamalan doesn't do any of that, instead he paints himself into a corner in his current film, ""Signs"" starring Mel Gibson as a disenchanted priest/father/minister of some unknown religion trying to save his family from an alien invasion. The 'aliens' can apparently navigate across hundreds of parsecs of space to find planet Earth, but then need to place crop circles as directional and positional locators. And apparently Bucks County PA is of such import to them that they place crop circles in Mel Gibson's back forty. The aliens, despite all their advanced technology, can get locked in a pantry.Firstly, it doesn't know what it is. It's not a horror film, because it isn't all that scary, suspenseful or even thrilling. It isn't science fiction, because Shyamalan insists on telling an alien invasion story from a microcosmic view point that never extends more than a mile or two from the Hess farm where the 'action', if I may use that term here, takes place. The only views of the rest of the world we get are from painfully stiff and fake-seeming news reports of alien ships around the world. This movie has no style, and someone ought to tell Mr. Shyamalan that there exists within the movie business numerous devices other than tripods and cranes with which to hold a camera. Either the camera is static, panning back and forth or rising above the action. There are no tracks, dollies, gimbals or anything that conveys motion, everything in the film seems to be a set-piece event with only a camera to bear witness to it. Everything in this film, characters, events, are so stiff that emotions are stifled if not smothered outright. No one reacts to anything in any consistent fashion. Worse, people's reactions to serious events are so skewed, that it quickly became unconvincing.The most noticeable examples of this are when we learn that the aliens' presence is making animals a little nutty, supposedly the way they act when a predator is nearby and one of the Hess family Shepherds lunges at Mel's daughter. The son kills the dog (off camera) with a big barbecue fork to the throat and when Mel and the sheriff arrive on the scene, the son is staring blankly, the daughter is sitting on her swing set staring blankly, with only a few mute tears between them. Mel and the sheriff stare blankly at the dead animal. However, when Mel decides to put it to a vote as to whether the family should head for the lake or stay in the farm house, the son freaks when Mel states that because he represents 2 parents that he gets two votes.There is no tension in this film. All we need to know, apparently, we learn from the son who reads ONE book on ETs and suddenly has them all figured out. And if he doesn't know it, the TV reveals everything else. If it's an invasion, he says, they won't use their advanced because we'll nuke the planet making it useless to them. They'll fight 'hand to hand' to prevent this, there seems to be no middle ground here. When it's revealed on the news that the aliens leave just as quickly as they arrived, the kid figures out that it's a raid and they're just harvesting humans. The crop circles themselves are map coordinates and while Washington and New York are major sites, so is Bucks County, Pennsylvania.The worst aspect of the film is Gibson's character. Apart from being stiff, he plays a priest/reverend/father who lost his faith when his wife died 6 months previous. But when his son doesn't die from an alien gas attack because he was having an asthma attack and didn't breath it, he suddenly finds it again, as if it were hidden behind the couch all along. Second, exactly WHICH Christian faith did he belong to? He dressed as a Catholic priest and took a confession in a drug store, yet he can't be Catholic, because he was married.Mostly though, this movie was just plain boring. I was never once on the 'edge of my seat' as so many people and the advertisements claim, and it isn't because I am so jaded a movie goer that 'Signs' just didn't reach me. I cried when Sully said good-bye to Boo in 'Monsters, Inc.' so I know it's not that. There is no suspense, no real imperilment of the family, only family pets left to die at the hands of the alien invaders. You can't makes these kinds of films in a microcosm, because there is just too much else to consider. It bored me, it really did, and I know Shyamalan can do better, because he had my undivided attention in 'The Sixth Sense', so why not this one? Because it's really that bad.",Signs

255079,"Star Trek V The Final Frontier, while not being the best of the TOS movies, is not a bad story at all.  It primarily focuses on friendship and family.  The family of course being the three main characters.  The story could've used some tweaking up here and there, but it still works well.  The producers could've paid a little more attention to details though, I do not think that the Constitution class starship had in excess of 78 decks.  What would've made it a little more interesting is if Sean Connery had been able to play the role of Sybok.  Unfortunately for Star Trek and fortunate for Tom Clancy fans, he was busy filming &quot;The Hunt for Red October.&quot;  Overall though, in my opinion, Star Trek V is a good Star Trek movie and in good keeping with what Gene Roddenberry wanted out of Star Trek.",N/A

As a long time Roxy fanatic, this is something to be cherished.Bryan Ferry and Roxy Music have provided the soundtrack to my life for the last decade. This may seem odd considering that I am only in my mid-twenties and all throughout high school and college, while my classmates were listening to the depressing grunge stylings of Nirvana, or Ganster Rap, or, worse, Dave Matthews, I was indulging my passion for avant-garde rock made in the 70's and 80's.Whether it was desperately trying to swoon young women (usually in vain) to Avalon, or total, drunken debauchery with their first, eponymous album,Roxy Music was always present in my everyday life and, particularly, in my social circles. Country Life and Vodka & Tonics seemed to go hand in hand.In the summer of 2001, while I was in the midst one of my most memorable summers to date, I got to see my aging icons live in concert...twice! This is something I never dreamed imaginable. It was undoubtedly the greatest concert experience I have ever witnessed.But enough of this sentimental mumbo-jumbo! Whether Roxy Music has or hasn't been the soundtrack to your life, or whether you are twenty-something or fifty-something, this is a terrific souvenir of one of the most talented and influential bands of all time. Original members Ferry, Manzanera, Mackay and Thompson are backed by a group of very talented young musicians. The audience goes wild and so will you! Start to finish, this is an amazing concert! As an added bonus, the backstage documentary is a terrific and often humorous look inside it all...Don't wait....Get this DVD!",Live at Apollo

This is highly desirable, because Tolkien's Lord of the Rings trilogy is the greatest English language twentieth century fantasy novel. This movie has outstanding acting. The performances given by Viggo Mortensen (Aragorn) and Sean Bean (Boromir) near the end of FOTR were particularly effective.  The scenery and special effects were exceptional. New Zealand was the perfect location for shooting this movie.  The integration of live and CGI action images was executed perfectly and seamlessly.  Peter Jackson did an extraordinary job directing this movie. As usual, the book is better than the movie, but FOTR is still well worth watching.",The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring
700935,"I saw this movie last night at the San Francisco International Film Festival.  It stars Japanese heartthrob Takashi Sorimachi as O, the best assassin in Asia, and Hong Kong heartthrob Andy Lau as Tok, an up-and-coming assassin who wants to be known as the best and thus challenges O.  I went into this movie not expecting much but was pleasantly surprised, especially by the last third of the movie as it showed unexpected depths and twists.Not to say this movie is without flaws -- there's lots of typical extraneous violence, many hokey lines, and unbelievable scenes.  However, the movie's switching between Japanese, Cantonese, Mandarin, and English (depending on the native language of the speaker) is a bit of a surprise and gives the movie a bit more of a cosmopolitan, realistic feel than most HK action flicks (don't worry, it's subtitled in Chinese and English).  But the action is well-paced, with amusing references to the first-person shoot-em-up video games like ""Doom"" and ""Halo"" that it sometimes resembles, and interesting camera angles and editing.  Sorimachi delivers a sexy performance as the efficient but terse O, and Lau walks a psychotic edge as the flamboyant Tok with a love for movies.""Fulltime Killer"" isn't for everyone, but if you enjoy Hong Kong action films or are a fan of one of the stars, or like action films with a bit of a twist and aren't expecting ""War and Peace"", then check this one out.",N/A
524863,"Edward Norton burst on the scene by playing a psychopathic killer in 1996's Primal Fear. His reputation was secured afterwards by his performances as a reformed neo-Nazi in American History X and as the nameless narrator in Fight Club. it is perhaps not so surprising that he chose to balance this tendency towards seriousness by choosing a romantic comedy for his first directorial job. The result is Keeping the Faith, an affable and charming movie whose main fault is its rather long running time. This is a weakness common among actors turned director. It was probably inevitable that Norton should also do this, as his best friend, Stuart Blumberg, wrote the script. More on that later.Brian Finn and Jake Scram [Norton and Ben Stiller] have been friends since childhood. Brian is an Irish Catholic lad, while Jake is a Jew. In the marvelous melting pot that is New York City, this is not at all an uncommon union. What turns out to be unusual is that Brain becomes a priest and Jake a rabbi. When they were kids, there was a third best pal, a girl named Anna Riley [Jenna Elfman]. She moved away in the eighth grade and eventually became but a memory. In the first part of the movie, Anna returns to New York and hooks up with her old buddies. She has become a beautiful and successful young woman. Jake and Brian are both smitten, and therein lies the crux of the comedy. Brian, of course, has his vow of chastity, which until Anna's arrival seems to have not been a problem for him. As for Jake, his congregation assumes that this most eligible bachelor will choose a nice Jewish girl. There is a lot of pressure on Jake, who is barraged by mothers pushing their daughters on him. In one of the movie's funniest scenes, Jake's date with Ali Decker [Lisa Edelstein] turns into one that he will never forget. How will Brian and Jake resolve the Anna dilemma, which threatens both their friendship and their careers? Isn't this a no win situation for all three?One of the movie's big advantages is that Edward Norton and Stuart Blumberg really are an Irish kid and a Jewish one being best friends. They are New Yorkers and have lived together for several years. As a result, they were able to find New York locations rarely seen on film. This give the picture a fresh look and also makes the city look much more livable than it often does. The acting is first rate, as you would expect. Norton does have a flair for comedy, although he needs to work a bit on the physical aspects of it. Ben Stiller is one of the funniest men alive, and Jenna Elfman departs for once from her famous television persona. The running time of over two hours is excessive for this type of entertainment and slows the film down, but it does not ruin it by any means. It is simply something Norton should be aware of on his next project.Perhaps the best thing about Keeping the Faith is its innocence. Lately there have been a number of often good but quite cynical comedies. It is godd to see one where you can laugh at your fellow man and still feel great about the human race.",Keeping The Faith

518941,"Denounced by several key critics and avoided by many moviegoers, Fight Club has seemingly found its audience on DVD. Pardon the pun, but its a knockout of a movie. Violent? Oh, yes. Gratuitous? I don't think so. I can understand the controversy. Violence in society is at the forefront of today's news. I don't think Fight Club is any more pro-violence than Saving Private Ryan is pro-war.Edward Norton plays a character referred to only as The Narrator. I think this was done for two reasons, one of which I can tell you without writing a plot-spoiler. His character is nameless because he has become so alienated and frustrated that he has no identity left. He is the victim of the empty promises of the bourgeois lifestyle that, sadly, so many of us are caught up in today. Many of us work for corporations so vast that they are both faceless and soulless. Never in history have so many material goods been dangled before us, The the more we acquire, the less fulfilled many of us are. As the movie says, sometimes the things we own wind up owning us.One day, The Narrator comes up with a plan. He starts attending support groups for people with various mental and physical afflictions. He thinks he will feel better if he hangs out with those who are worse off than he is. This works until he meets the chain-smoking, neurotic Marla [Helena Bonham Carter], who has the same plan, but for different reasons. After a few weeks, he confronts her and demands that she change her schedule so that she doesn't go to the meetings on the days he does. When she refuses, he sinks back into his personal abyss. Things change when, on a plane flight, he meets Tyler Dane [Brad Pitt]. Forceful, direct and more than a little anarchistic, Tyler is the antithesis of The Narrator. When our character arrives home, he finds his condominium has been destroyed by a mysterious explosion. Not knowing where to turn, he calls Tyler, the only person recently who has made sense to him. He moves into Tyler's derelict house. Soon, the charismatic Tyler commandeers the basement of a seedy bar and transforms it into a fight club, a place where other frustrated males can beat each other senseless. A few months later, there is a string of clubs across America. Tyler becomes a hero of mythic proportions to the members, and The narrator is always right by his side.The idea of a fight club may sound like a testosterone induced hallucination. To a degree, it is, but that's taking the literal approach. Most of director David Fincher's movies are metaphors, and none is more so than Fight Club. Here he gives us a vision of a vast segment of males suffering a mass identity crisis because modern society has rendered them so powerless. The club is make believe. I fear the identity crisis may be real. Of course, beating each senseless doesn't solve their problems, yet there are many examples in history of groups so oppressed that they wind up taking out their frustrations on each other. Regardless of whether of not you agree with Fincher's assessment, the fact remains that this is a brilliant movie.The cast is superb. Norton and Bonham Carter have excelled in everything they have ever done, and Pitt has his best role since Legends of the Fall.",N/A

543240,"Let's get a few things clear for those of you who have not yet seen &quot;The Princess Diaries...&quot; no, the movie is not one of the best pictures of the year; no, the movie is not Oscar material; no, the movie is not one of Disney's best. But is it funny? It can be. Does it have a good deal of charm as promised in its promotional campaign? Yes. Is it worth the time and money? I like to think so.&quot;The Princess Diaries&quot; is a basic, rags-to-riches Cinderella story given a modern makeover with some new and different characters, all uplifted by a cast and a director who seems to bring out the best the material has to offer. I'll be honest: movies like this are usually a hit-or-miss with me, and this latest addition was no exception to my skepticism. All-in-all, it's nothing too terribly special, and the comedy isn't as present as it could be, but it's not a total waste of time, and it can be a lot of fun.At the center of the story is misfit Mia Thermopolis (Anne Hathaway), the classic klutz case who can't seem to get her act together, bumping into objects and people, becoming the center of attention in the worst possible way. Life is just one barrage of insults and mean-spirited jeers for her, so it makes little impact when her paternal grandmother decides to pay a visit to San Francisco with news of her succession to the throne of the country Genovia after the recent death of her father.At first, Mia becomes rebellious towards her grandmother, Queen of Genovia (Julie Andrews), and her mother, who she blames for keeping her royal stature a secret from her for all of her fifteen years. Then, of course, she starts getting more into the spirit of things, with a flashy new makeover to rid her of her bushman eyebrows and her frizzy hair. She soon rises to stardom as the people at school are eager to gain her attention and some small share of her fame.As with any teen-oriented movie, there are going to be setbacks that dot the fairy tale countryside: here, it centers on Mia's crush on a hunky jock who only sees her for her fame, and little else. Immediately smitten, she blows off the boy who really cares for her, as well as her friends, only to realize the trouble she has caused herself, leading us into the mandatory happy ending that Disney is always so masterful at achieving.It's nothing new, and the movie does have its shortcomings. The movie doesn't really have a great deals of comedy to it, and what laughs it does have are few and far between. There are some priceless lines of dialogue interspersed in the script: at one point, Mia's makeover artist refers to her eyebrows as &quot;Frida&quot; and &quot;Kalo,&quot; while the wonderful wit of her driver, Joseph (Hector Elizondo), is wonderful.And just as Elizondo hits a high note, so does much of the cast. Andrews is back in fine form, reprising much of the charm and charisma from her past roles and giving it all she's got here. Hathaway does a good enough job of playing the turn-around princess trying to make a splash, while Heather Matarazzo and Robert Schwartzman are equally well-cast as her two closest friends who see her through tough times. Teen idols Mandy Moore and Erik von Detten make appearances as two of Mia's tormentors, so it's no surprise that I found myself cheering her on when she exacts her revenge on each of them.When it's all over and done with, &quot;The Princess Diaries&quot; doesn't add much to the cuteness, but it doesn't give it a bad name, either. It's a pleasant enough diversion from reality that doesn't overstay its welcome, and continues to charm with its well-rounded cast of actors. If for nothing else, watch it for the chance to see Andrews make a wonderful comeback, and, of course, to see Mandy Moore get slopped with an ice cream cone... ahh, sweet revenge.",Disney's The Princess Diaries

407042,"Wow, ok let's analyze this series. Let us ignore the fact that it is an Anime for the start of it. It keeps it simple that way. Ok, it's about a boy, he has problems like many kids in the U.S. today, seriously, Mother's dead, Father's [mean]. He's completely self-sufficient and therefore has trouble coping with reality. It's a kid that you would see a lot of in the world today. That eliminates all the people complaining in reviews that Shinji (main charecter) is some kind of mindless ""weirdo"" and that everyone in this series is insane. Sorry to disappoint you but the world is not puppies and butterflies. Next, onto the Anime part of this. It's plot is beautifully woven and there were parts where I had goosebumps man. It seems wierd ""Yeh he got goosebumps from a cartoon what a loser"" But, its just that touching, the problems are very real despite the mechanical and alienated creatures that this story spits out at you. The people have real lives, real problems, realy accomplishments.Also, if you aren't a big fan of plots. That means you absolutely love stories like DragonBall Z and the like. Where someone repeatedly saves the world from countless alien creatures without much of real people problems. Then no don't bother watching this series. Don't get me wrong I love DragonBall Z but, as far as plots and stories go. Neon Genesis is the best. The last two episodes, before End of Evangelion that is. Confused me, and just extremely bothered me. I watched End of Evangelion, lol well let's just say I think the creator had some problems putting this story to rest because it still bothered me but, I'm happy now. It did explain all of the problems with the humans instead of the Angels (alien creatures). Which was a lot better than expected, but ... the last scene, I just don't get it. But, that ok the story is stunning, graphics and fight sequences are the best. Don't listen to anyone until you've watched the first few episodes and really picked up on the story. Then you can tell me I'm wrong.I have edited in this part.  I have a 12-year-old brother, who believes DragonBall Z is the best Anime and they only one worth watching.  I forced him through the process of beating him senselessly and throwing him on the couch, to watch the first episode.  I was bewildered when we both spent the rest of our Winter Break watching the series and movies and talking about the series and getting all of our friends hooked on it.  So I say...

297717,"Even after sixty years, CITIZEN KANE remains as one of the greatest movies of all time. Though it is true that some are bored by the movie because it's &#34;just a boring black-and-white movie with no action&#34;, those who hold that opinion are in the minority. KANE is often held as the pinnacle of filmmaking by movie buffs not just because of the advances the movie made in film production, but also because it set the standard that all filmmakers wish to reach: the total director's vision; a movie made with total control and no studio intervention. With that said, what does KANE hold for the average film-goer? The movie has an excellent script (it won an Oscar), great acting, and a haunting score. The story, though loosely based on the life of William Randolph Hearst, is an old one: powerful man starts out promising and full of ideals, becomes consumed by greed and loses his vision, and ends up losing it all (anyone read Macbeth or ALL THE KING'S MEN?).

587903,"In these times, when the world is concerned with terrorism, it seems logical to create a movie based on an American hero who beats the odds and defeats the enemy. But that's when the logic ends.  The first twenty minutes are interesting - the introduction of all the characters, including the rebels, played by Owen Wilson and Gabriel Macht. On a mission, these two fly beyond the allowed flight space, discover military activity and are shot down. After that, the intrigue ends, and the suspenseful monotonous chase begins as Wilson flees from the Serb army in order to rendez-vous with his squadron. This story seems almost plausible, except for the too frequent narrow escapes, and the numerous lapses in judgment on the part of Wilson's character. For example - surviving running through a mine field, not being shot by an entire army, hiding under dead bodies, and my personal favorite - while wearing black, Wilson stops for a break on a white concrete slope, fully aware of the army chasing him. In fact, about half hour into the movie, I found myself rooting for the sniper - in the sheer hope that he would kill Wilson and the movie would end.",Behind Enemy Lines
21817,"Cecilia Roth shines as a woman whose only son is cut down in the prime of life while she watched helplessly.  After his death, she commits to finding his father, and so begins a telling search for the truth that is at once tinged with sadness and yet filled with wondeful spirit and light.  Aldomovar is a genius of perception, and this film - rightfully an Oscar Winner for Best Foreign Language Film - ranks up there with his own ""Women on the Verge of a Nervous Breakdown"" as one of the best films to ever come from Spain (or any foreign country for that matter.)  Funny, fast, furious and frightening at once, the tale is spun through Roth's point of view - that of a heartbroken mother who finds redemption via a cast of unseeming characters who both ooze humanity and pathos.  A brilliant film, not to be missed!",N/A

223696,"This 1980 film is about a family who has lost a son in a boating accident. The surviving son is played by Timothy Hutton who won a well-deserved Academy Award for this role.  He's magnificent. My heart went out to him from the first moment he's on the screen.Donald Sutherland plays his father with compassion and understanding.  Mary Tyler Moore is cast as the mother in a very unsympathetic role.  She can't seem to love this second son of hers, and doesn't even seem to try.  There is always a false smile on her face as she presents a picture of the perfect wife and mother to the world.  There's a coldness inside that just can't be reached.  She was so natural in this role that it seemed she is like this in real life.  But I guess that is what good acting is all about.  Judd Hirsh is cast as an understanding psychiatrist who helps the boy as well as the father.Robert Redford does an admirable job of directing this film.  He brings out outstanding performances from all involved and makes sure that the cinematography is used to enhance rather than get in the way of the story.  The film belongs to the screenwriter and the actors who get to show off their immense talents.I wish I liked the film more. I found it moved much too slowly for my taste.  It is a deep character study and it just got deeper and deeper into the characters' unhappy lives.  I found myself frustrated, bored and impatient.  I just wanted to put my hands on Mary Tyler Moore's shoulders and shake her.  I didn't want to watch another uncomfortable incident with the boy.  And the father's grief at being thrust into the middle between his wife and his son was hard to watch.My personal tastes, however, do not detract from the fact that this is a good film and well deserved all the awards it received.  I do recommend it.  Just be prepared to be uncomfortable.",Ordinary People VHS
559439,"This movie was definatly interesting. It brought me back to my younger days when I used to sneak out and tell my parents that I was going over a freinds house to spend the night. It gave me that feeling of knowing that you were doing something that you were not supposed to.Groove is set in SanFrancisco, the dirty metropolitan area blends to make a gritty dark film with the light of children in all there wickedness.Basically its about a promoter of the rave scene that has lot's of friends and is trying to throw the ultimate underground. There are a few setback's in his journey. The place where they picked for the rave was perfectly set in a dark warehouse district with a police station only blocks away. One of the main characters has never done &quot;E&quot; before and he is persuaded to go. In doing so he meets a beautiful raver girl that shows him life from a different perspective.Maybe it's because I grew up like the film portrays kids. It just brought me back to the badness of childhood in all its splendor. All of the character development is awesome and they are all fighting there own problems in different ways.Its a fast paced fun journey (This film) I highly recommend it.

452883,"Laurie Strode (Jamie Lee Curtis) didn't even know she had a brother, until he tried to kill her on Halloween night of 1978.  She knew about psychotic killer Michael Myers, of course, as did everyone in her neighborhood of Haddonfield, Illinois, who killed his older sister when he was only six years old and was incarcerated in the state loony bin, but she didn't know she was related to Michael because she was relocated and given a name change after the brutal crime.  Laurie was seventeen when Michael escaped and tried to kill her off, the sole surviving member of his original family.  He didn't succeed, but he did massacre a number of her friends and assorted others who got in his way.  Michael was presumed dead after that night of mass murder, but his body was never found.Laurie faked her death and changed her name again, this time to Keri Tate, and became the headmistress of a posh private prep school.  The years have not been kind to her.  At age thirty-seven, her husband has divorced her, and her seventeen year old son John (Josh Hartnett) finds her overprotectively paranoid.  She's an alcoholic, to boot.  She's always been certain Michael will return one day to finish off old business, and with his obsession about murdering all his kin, John will be next in line after her.Just as she's beginning to learn to trust again with new beau Adam Arkin, and starting to lighten-up on watching over her son, her worst fear becomes a reality.  Michael has found out her new identity, and tracked her down.  And, needless to say, the intervening years have done nothing to improve his disposition...This is a great script, well-acted and -directed and handsomely produced.  It has more tension than any entry in the series, except for the first.  The action is plenty nasty.  There are a number of terrific camera shots, the best being of Laurie and Michael's first face-to-face confrontation through a porthole-style window.  The music score is excellent, making marvellous use of the famous original John Carpenter/Alan Howarth theme and adding new dimensions to it, though that actual theme is oddly underused during the gripping finale.  The opening credit sequence and music is phenomenally good, panning and cross-dissolving over headline clippings of Michael's previous reign of terror and Laurie's sad history, while an actor doing a near-perfect impersonation of the late Donald Pleasance (Michael's doctor, from the preceding entries) narrates highlights of the same.  The ending of the movie is especially surprising and satisfying.The best thing about this film, though, is Jamie Lee Curtis' mature performance of a woman barely coping with the lasting scars of deep trauma, which is credibly and sensitively handled.Unfortunately, another sequel (Halloween: Resurrection) followed this perfect conclusion to the popular series, though that doesn't diminish H20's stature.  Even those who've never seen any of the other entries will enjoy it, on its own merits.",Halloween H20 VHS

I've always thought English film and TV productions are far superior to our productions and this just proves my point.The acting, scenery and everything on screen is a treat for the eyes and ears.Colin Firth is wonderful as the broodingly handsome Mr. Darcy. His arrogance and charm come through and he develops all through the movie. It's wonderful to watch.Jennifer Ehle is a beautiful and independant Elizabeth who give him a taste of his own medicine.The cast is truly outstanding. Elizabeths family is typical of the times and her father is a bit of a weak man who has just  given up and accepts what life has given him. The mother is a twit who hasn't a thing between her ears but air. Jane is a good older sister but a bit colorless. Lydia is perfectly acted and comes across just as she's supposed to. Poor Mr. Wickham. As bad as he's portrayed, you almost feel sorry for him, being stuck with that flighty Lydia for the rest of his life. The other sisters are rather non-descript but add to the story in their own way.Mr. Darcy is dark and brooding. He is also in his own way kind and generous. This comes out later as his charactor developes into a most wonderful person.This is definitely one of the finest productions by A&amp;E.

198810,"Frankenstein had life before this the second filmed version of Mary Shelley's novel (the first was a lost silent film). Originally Robert Florey was slated to direct and a young screenwriter by the name of John Huston had a hand in the early screenplay. Bela Lugosi was offered the role and it was announced as his follow up to Dracula. All of this, of course, never happened. Lugosi chose not to do the film and Florey moved along with him to his next project.Stage director James Whale had just made his first feature film and chose Boris Karloff to play the monster. He cast Karloff after making a number of sketches of the actor's face in the role. Two careers were born along with the Monster. John Balderston's adaption plays fast and loose with the source material but it works. Jack Pierce's make up for Karloff was astounding for its time rivaling the best work of Lon Chaney.The film is a bit stiff and static but then so were many early talkies. The sound cameras were too cumbersome to move around a lot. Still, the photography and Whale's direction are both strong. It's clear, though, that Whale is still a little unsure of himself as a director as the film is packed with dialog (much of it unnecessary). Performances are uniformly excellent with Dwight Frye notable for his scenery chewing as the hunchbacked assistant to Dr. Frankenstein. Colin Clive plays Frankenstein as a jittery, nervous high strung individual (much like Clive himself no doubt).The extras are great on the DVD. The commentary is always interesting and provides much insight into the era (including the difficulties when the film was reissued. The Hays Commission dictated that the film be edited prior to re-release eliminating the sequence between the Monster and the little girl at the well). Frankenstein isn't Whale or Karloff's best film but clearly one of their most important.",N/A

573686,"This review is from a guy who has seen every last episode of Angel Links. I'm just reviewing the 1st DVD to give people a head's up about this series.This is a good show, but it's clear that they did not put as much creative work into this as they did Outlaw Star. I guess we're supposed to be so distracted by Meifon Lee's rack that it shouldn't matter, but there is a severe lack of creativity in this anime. I can appreciate that two of the supporting characters appeared in Outlaw Star, but a talking Dinosaur? I mean c'mon people can't we make Aliens anymore or are we going to settle with walking talking animals that can be found right here on Earth, or at least in the fossil record?And what's with this cute little pet called ""Taffei"" that transforms into her sword? Can anyone say Ryo-Ohki?You could tell that they just threw this together and placed it in the Outlaw Star universe. I'm not upset that this show was not like Outlaw Star but Angel Links really had the potential to be different if they stuck to the more unique elements, which they failed to do. Angel Links bounces back and forth from one point to another. Sometimes they'll be focusing on the mystery of Meifon's past, yet in others the main thrust would be on their job of protecting people. This approach makes Angel Links seem like just another typical space show and therefore nothing special.While Angel Links doesn't break any new ground in the plot department, the visuals definitely rock the house. The art of Angel Links is incredible! Every aspect is beautifully and uniquely done -- from the characters to the ships! There's nothing generic in Angel Links, unlike in some anime where characters and things look more or less the same.Overall, I'd recommend this to basically anyone who enjoys space-type anime, but don't expect another Outlaw Star, for it doesn't come close.",Angel Links: Avenging Angel - Volume 1

You start out with a highly in-depth look at the making of the film and the history of the story all hosted by the delightful Celine Dion. Celine also hosts a HIGHLY entertaining segment called &quot;The Story Behind The Story.&quot; In this segment actors Angela Lansbury, Robby Benson, Jodi Benson, Ming-Na, James Earl Jones, Paige O'Hara and David Ogden Stiers relive the Disney versions and original stories of 'The Hunchback of Note Dame,' 'The Jungle Book,' 'Mulan,' 'The Lion King,' 'Cinderella, 'Sleeping Beauty' and 'Pocahontas.' The DVD also features the music video to the highly successful song &quot;Beauty and the Beast&quot; performed by Celine Dion and Peabo Bryson. For some unknown reason, Disney felt it necessary to include a newer version of the song performed by Jump 5. It's a crime that Disney wasted these talentless youngster's time to record a version of the song that in no way fits into the magic of this film. Celine and Peabo already recorded the song beautifully. Why did Disney hire people who can't sing a note to record the same song? The film itself has been fully resorted and the picture and sound quality has never been better. It even includes a new musical number &quot;Human Again&quot; which I could really do without. Many people like the song but I think it's poorly written and even more poorly performed. But it doesn't take anything away from this being one of the greatest films ever made. I'm really happy with what Disney has come up with this time. This &quot;Special Edition&quot; actually is special.

474257,"This innovative horror has Patricia Arquette as Frankie, a hairdresser who suddenly starts experiencing the stigmata.  Eventually the Vatican gets to hear of it and send miracle detective Father Kiernan (Byrne) to find out if it's a true miracle.  Upon arrival it soon becomes apparent that this is no ordinary case: Frankie is experiencing more of the five wounds of Christ than any stigmatic ever has before and, anyway, she doesn't believe in God.Obviously there's a lot of comparisons to be made to 'The Exorcist', but this is actually an entirely different movie.  For one thing, it's about as modern as any movie could hope to be, with techno music and electric photography.  Secondly there's a lot here to suggest that this isn't your usual horror.  Interestingly, rather than focusing squarely on Frankie's personal hell it also takes into accounts the Church as Father Kiernan discovers an elaborate conspiracy in the Vatican.  It turns out that Frankie is more than just a stigmatic but is trying to uncover the secret of an entirely new gospel, that of Jesus' own words.This plot is not only controversial but incredibly interesting in a day when most modern horror movies merely ape their predecessors.  Here the hope doesn't lie in religion, in fact it's the exact opposite, with the Church being portrayed as a powerful and anything but benevolent force.  Doubtless this will offend many, although the concept is nothing short of original.The acting is very good indeed as well, especially Arquette and Byrne as the two leads.  Plus, despite not being especially frightening, the violent scenes have been directed with great care, looking a lot more at Frankie than at the act itself.  It's not often that you can call a horror movie visually arresting.  Not only that, but it's good too.",Stigmata VHS

Sure, the special effects are paper mashe' monsters that stand still for five minutes doing nothing, but if one had half an imagination one could suspend thier disbelief.  Dr. Who is not to be watched as a Box Office movie or a deep emotional TV series with heavy serious issues. No, these stories are simply fun to watch. And the stories interesting because they are unique and sometimes surreal.  And the enjoyment they bring is the bottom line, isn't it...Think of the sets as a play.  That is how this is done.  The opratic costume designs of Nimon and Meglos.  Ignor the fact that Kroll looks like a paper mashe'.  If you see a play the sets aren't there to be 'realistic' they are there as a simbol of what they represent.  I think the monster is quiet good in Kroll if you ignor the fact that special effects are better now than then. People are too spoiled by special effects in shows that I find pale in comparison to Dr. Who as far a story and characters.  Star Trek Next Gen, Farscape, Lexx, all a bunch of over-glorified soap opra filler with mush and sex and special FX.Dr. Who, an entertaining story with beautiful sets, even if they aren't 'realistic' or 'believable'.

598089,"I read ""Divine Secrets of the Ya-Ya Sisterhood"" several years ago when it first came out.  I found it ok, not great, and was surprised that it became such a phenomenal best-seller.  However, I just had to see the movie and have to say I think the movie actually improved on the book.  Ashley Judd was the stand-out performer in her role as the young adult Vivi.  She expressed all the pent-up frustration, the emptiness, and the loneliness that led Vivi to her breakdown. Ellen Burstyn was also memorable as the older and often ditzy Vivi. The other Ya-Yas (Fionnula Flannagan, Maggie Smith, and Shirley Knight) were all endearing though it took a large suspension of belief to accept Maggie Smith as a Southern belle.  They showed the unconditional love that binds women and had many humorous moments that lifted the film from its otherwise heavy message.The movie opens with one of its most pricless scenes---the young Ya-Yas beginning their secret society--- and keeps that richly textured friendship in evidence throughout the entire film.

507217,"of the coveted ""worst movie in history"" award. the intro to kolobos is not that bad, it starts off really strong with a good 20 minutes of getting to know the characters. unfortuanitly the characters are annoying. i do admit, the characters are much better than the acting though. and the acting is much better than the script. the plot-o-kolobos was predicable and had a very obvious ending, a poorly executed attempt at a shocking, mind blowing finale. to say i was completely disappointed with kolobos would be a lie, i did keep my attention, i assume because it was like a bad car wreck, you don't want to look, but you can't look away. kolobos is an awful movie regardless, and at no point during the duration of the flick are you going to say ""WOW, this is so real, all hail kolobos"" don't buy it, don't rent it, don't think about what you just read, turn off your moniter and run away screaming. side note- if you like this movie, you should check out the following-> battlefield earth, the 6th day, Rabid Grannies, Final Destination, Ax 'Em, and countless other movies that are equally horrible.",N/A

This huge cast of characters is thoroughly interesting and the director did a magnificent job with this film.  As usual, I'm totally impressed with Maggie Smith, who always gives her best in each project.  This dvd has some nice extras and well worth adding to your dvd collection.  Ryan Phillipe does a nice job, especially along side of a group of veteran British actors--a daunting task but he succeeds none-the-less.  I recommend this film highly.  Very entertaining!",N/A
692438,"This lighthearted romp of a caper movie is a remake of the successful 1960s film staring Frank Sinatra and the rest of the Las Vegas Rat Pack. The title refers to the name of the lead character, Danny Ocean, played by George Clooney, who assembles a team of 11 men to steal $180 million from a casino. Directed by Steven Soderbergh, the film is a slick spoof all the way, the high profile cast being the glue that holds this film together. There's Brad Pitt and Matt Damon and Julia Roberts and Andy Garcia and Elliott Gould and Carl Reiner. And there was no expense spared on the wardrobe or the glittery sets or the use of modern high tech special effects. Forget about the story; it's not supposed to be real. But yet there's fast paced action and tension throughout as the cast deals with setbacks and complications leading up to and including the caper. It's fun all the way. Just relax and don't take it seriously.",N/A
405473,"Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory is one of those rare films that has made a seamless transition from book to screen. The adaptation of Roald Dahl's classic is true to form and delivers the goods. Children of any age will relate to candy, chocolates, magic, and mystery; and Willy Wonka has it all. The characters are interesting and each have their faults: Augustus is a glutton, Violet is obsessive compulsive, Mike T.V.'s affliction is fairly obvious and Veruca Salt is the perfect spoiled brat. Charlie seemingly does not have any imperfections except for one that is revealed at the conclusion of the film: he is TOO kindhearted. All of the actors do a great job especially Gene Wilder who Willy Wonka is wry and cynical but a true dreamer. This is a timeless film for people of all ages. The factory itself has aged very well, it still looks like magic everytime Willy opens the door into the chocolate room, and don't deny it every single one of us would love just 5 minutes alone in that room! There is only one questionable scene in the film which comes during the boat ride sequence and really has no place in the film. It depicts animals eating each other, a chicken being decapitated, and a snake running across a woman's face. These images should not have been included and are scary to children. Some of the other musical sequences are quite trite as well. The one in particular is when Charlie's mother is singing as he is walking home(talk about skip or fast forward). But regardless, Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory is a timeless, magical journey of a film and should not be missed by anyone. Highly Recommended.",Willy Wonka & the Chocolate Factory VHS

Let's start with the fact that Susan Saradon's character is so far from unreal it is not funny.  She dotes on her kids to a fault, keeps up the 3 story Victorian house all by herself, is smart and funny.  So I guess the only reason her husband didn't want her anymore is because she grew older.  But at least they still can be friends.  Hell, he even went out and bought a lid of grass for her to help with the cancer treatment.  I hate the depiction of father is suppose to be spending time with the kids and they are being taken care of by the fiance'.  Dad has to go to work, well doesn't she?  She loses her job over his kids crisis?  The mom doesn't have any friends or relatives that the kids can go to while she is in treatment?  No, she has to go to the woman who lost her son while she was working on a photo shoot. Too silly for words.

First, we are presented with some informative interviews with Gerry Stickells (Hendrix's road manager), Mitch Mitchell, and Billy Cox. This segues into the concert itself, with Jimi backstage, ready to go on.The songs all appear in proper order. Bear in mind, this isn't the ENTIRE concert (Hey Joe, Hey Baby, and Midnight Lightning weren't filmed, according to Experience Hendrix), but all the songs contained on the video are complete, and there's even some nice between-stage banter that's preserved. It's the small details, like that, which makes this film stand out from most of the other commercial JH video releases.As far as the music itself, it's incredible -- check out the mind-blowing versions of &quot;All Along the Watchtower&quot;, &quot;Freedom&quot;, &quot;Machine Gun&quot;, and even &quot;Voodoo Child (Slight Return)&quot;.

Next I rented a video documentary about Argento which oddly enough showed many scenes that had been censored from the version of Suspiria I watched. Those scenes are not permitted in actual movie context but were allowed in a documentary on the directors work? That is so weird.......Many complain here that there is no track listing for the 3rd disc/soundtrack in new DVD-Box.I have not examined the contents of all the discs in new set yet but I know the titles to the songs.Here they are: Track 1)Suspiria 5:57 2)Witch 3:10 3)Opening to the Sighs 0:32 4)Sighs 5:15 5)Markos 4:036)Black Forest 6:06  7)Blind Concert 6:11 8) Death Valzer 1:51 by Goblin (not 'the' Goblin)Hope that helps some curious people.

The movie is based on a true story and I think that it gives a good idea of how some of the fighting in Vietnam took place.  I gained appreciation of how terrible the war was and how the lack of support from the U.S. people would put soldiers lives at risk.

377414,"The classic cliffhanger of Episode 1 of The Daleks shows a mysterious arm moving towards a terrified Barbara, who screams at the sight of something.  Viewers had to wait a week later to see a creature that would become the most popular of the Doctor's villains.  A generation of British schoolchildren imitated their mechanical voices, holding their right arms out and saying ""EXTERMINATE!""The first four episodes of this story is The Dead Planet.  Once landing on Skaro, a planet with a petrified forest, Barbara asks Ian, ""Don't you ever wish he [the Doctor] deserves to have something happen to him?""  Her words turn out to be very prophetic indeed.  She's an unwilling traveller, as this is early in her time-travelling days.  Ian says, ""We better keep an eye on him.  He seems to have a knack of getting himself into trouble.""  After all, if anything happens to him, they're in deep trouble.The Doctor is determined to visit the Dalek city, but the others want to leave.  He sabotages the TARDIS's fluid link as a pretext to go to the city for some mercury.  Once there, first Barbara, then the others are captured by the Daleks.  To make matters worse, they have been walking around unprotected in fallout and are suffering from radiation sickness.  Susan encounters a Thal, Alydon, who gives them anti-radiation drugs.  The Thals were mortal enemies of the Daleks, but are now farmers who are starving and need food badly.The Thal leader, Temmosus, is a mystical idealist leader, too trusting.  He says,  ""I believe the Daleks hold the key to our future, whatever that future might be.  We must accept it... and without regret.""  Also, ""I never fight against the inevitable.  It's a vain occupation.""  He also believes in living in cooperation, as he chides Alydon's skepticism:  ""Suspicions are based on fear, and fear breeds hatred and war.""  Once he enters the Dalek city to collect the food they've left for the Thals, he says, ""They'll see that I'm unarmed.  There's no better argument against war than that.""Episode 3, which involves the traveller's attempt to free themselves from the cell by figuring out the Daleks' Achilles Heel, is a classic study of inductive reasoning and putting human thought to good use.Parts 5 through 7, collectively titled the Expedition, involve the travellers' attempt to get the fluid link back from the city.  They need the Thals' help, but the trouble is, the Thals have renounced war because of the neutron bomb that destroyed their civilization.  Barbara wonders, ""Can pacifism become a human instinct?"" Ian replies, ""Pacifism only works when everyone feels the same.""  However, Ian is the most moral in that he wants the Thals to fight for them only by them getting their freedom at the same time, not just for their fluid link.  At the same time, the way he gets them to fight is morally questionable, as it borders on taunting, even goading.  But Alydon says later, ""There is no indignity in being afraid to die, but there is a terrible shame in being afraid to live.""The city of the Daleks, despite being a model seen from a distance, is superbly realized, ""a magnificent subject for study.""Of the Thals Alydon, Ganatus, and Temmosus are richly developed characters, as is the cowardly Antodus, and credit is due to the actors portraying them.Flaw time:  The Daleks' geiger counter has the word ""DANGER"" written in English.  Also, they understand the note they have Susan write for them, as they clumsily mispronounce her name.The Doctor's parting advice to the Thals is wonderful.  ""You asked me for advice.  I never give it, never.  But I will say this.  Always search for the truth.  My truth is in the stars, and yours is here.""The Daleks is not only famous for putting Doctor Who on the map with 10 million viewers.  It serves as a classic model of effective storytelling, a serial with good cliffhangers, and a study examining human responsibility, group dynamics, idealism, pacifism, and xenophobia, and as such deserves its due.",Doctor Who: Daleks - The Dead Planet and The Expedition VHS

Anderson mines the same territory here that he did in &quot;Rushmore&quot;: the American Upper Middle Class...ridiculing it's apparent faults and foibles.Even though all the characters can produce a witticism about which we can wryly chuckle, the Tenenbaums are not cozy, not particularly nice nor do we much care for any of them except maybe the erstwhile &quot;villian,&quot; Royal Tenenbaum portrayed by Gene Hackman who brings a whole lotta life to the proceedings.Royal Tenenbaum, supposedly on his last legs physically and definitely penniless, after getting thrown out of his hotel of 22 years for non-payment of rent, descends upon the Tenenbaum home looking for a place to stay and maybe die.

Ceres wants to destroy the Mikage, so the Mikage want to destroy Ceres (who is sharing a body with Aya) first. Ceres especially wants to kill Aya's twin brother Aki. This results in a lot of trouble and heartache, then add Aya falling in love with Toya (who works for the Mikage) and Yuuhi (who's sister helps Aya) falling in love with Aya.....My thoughts: Very different from Fushigi Yugi, Yu Watase's other popular work, which is funny and for the most part light hearted. Ceres is somewhat dark and it's dramatic. My mini-plot doesn't really do it justice, there's a lot that goes on in Ceres, I had to know what happens next and couldn't stop watching it (I have an imported boxed set). If only Yuuhi were real, I'd marry him in a second! I recommend watching the dubbed first so it's easier to pay attention to plot and animation, and then watch the subbed to get a real feel for the emotion of the show. There is just something about the Japanese language that expresses emotion better than English. Toya's Japanese voice seems to fit him better, while Yuuhi's English voice seems to fit better. The music is very good, recycled a lot, but very good.Not for kids, I would say at least 13 and up. There's some nudity, violence, blood, and adult situations/themes.",N/A

93016,"No-one can portray American gangsters quite as vividly and realistically as Scorsese. He shows us the appeal of their glamour; but doesn't flinch at their violence; which is brutal, bloody, very often pointlessness, and always totally amoral.The film follows the rise of a Henry Hill, played by Ray Liotta, through the criminal ranks - loan sharking, hijacking trucks, killing - until he ends up as a close and trusted associate of the `Goodfellas' - a term that gangsters use for themselves: it means someone who can be trusted. It all turns sour when he feels that they have let him down and he turns to drug-smuggling behind the backs of his bosses, an unforgivable crime in their eyes.The film is gripping. Scene after scene holds the eye. Despite the film's length, the pace never relents. Liotta and De Niro are excellent, but it is Joe Pesci who steals the film. Not since James Cagney in `Public Enemy No 1' has a portrayal of a completely amoral thug been so frightening. The sense of violence bubbling under the surface of Pesci is never far away, and when it does erupt, it is quick, horrifying, but predictable.The period of time that Goodfellas covers, 1950s to the 1980s, means that the story tends to lurch from decade to decade, creating an episodic narrative rather than the more continues flow of `Mean Streets'. However, this is a minor criticism. The film is still a classic study of the Italian-American underworld and a great piece of film-making.",N/A
246875,"Flawlessly directed, written, performed, and filmed, this quiet and unpretentious Danish film is an example of cinema at its best, and if a person exists who can watch BABETTE'S FEAST without being touched at a very fundamental level, they are a person I do not care to know.The story is quite simple. In the 1800s, two elderly maiden ladies (Birgitte Federspiel and Bodil Kjer) reside in remote Jutland, where they have sacrificed their lives, romantic possibilities, and personal happiness in order to continue their long-dead father's religious ministry to the small flock he served. One of the women's youthful admirers sends to them a Frenchwoman, Babette (St&eacute;phane Audran), whose husband and son have been killed in France and who has fled her homeland lest she meet the same fate. Although they do not really require her services, the sisters engage her as maid and cook--and as the years pass her cleverness and tireless efforts on their behalf enables the aging congregation to remain together and the sisters to live in more comfort than they had imagined; indeed, the entire village admires and depends upon her. One day, however, Babette receives a letter: she has won a lottery and is now, by village standards, a wealthy woman. Knowing that her new wealth will mean her return to France, the sisters grant her wish that she be allowed to prepare a truly French meal for them and the members of their tiny congregation.The meal and the evening it is served is indeed a night to remember--but not for reasons that might be expected, for Babette's feast proves to be food for both body and soul, and is ultimately her gift of love to the women who took her in and the villagers who have been so kind to her. The film is extraordinary in every way, meticulous in detail yet not overpowering in its presentation of them. As the film progresses, we come to love the characters in both their simple devotion to God and their all-too-human frailties, and the scenes in which Babette prepares her feast and in which the meal is consumed are powerful, beautiful, and incredibly memorable. There have been several films that have used food as a metaphor for love, including WATER FOR CHOCOLATE and CHOCOLATE, but none approach the simple artistry and beauty of BABETTE'S FEAST, which reminds us of all the good things about humanity and which proves food for both body and soul. Highly, highly recommended.",Babette's Feast VHS

No, I'm far from being a teen, and I know this film isn't for me. And I wouldn't think of expecting anyone to try to ban this type of film. I would think this kind of movie would die out on it's own because there's nothing there, but they keep getting made.Well, I guess there is something there, and that something is the sight of pretty teenage girls in outfits skimpy enough to titillate but keep the rating at PG-13. The movie is so blatant about it there is one scene where the girlfriend is shown in about a dozen swim outfits within the span of two minutes for the sheer purpose of pleasing our hero, and we assume, the target audience.Of course they throw a moral plot hook about how you shouldn't lie at the end of the film for it's official justification. But that's after an hour and a half of every bodily function joke one can think of.The point is, if the reason you go to see the movie is to see scantily-clad young ladies, the world offers you a much better product with magazines, the Internet, and heck, even a lot of TV shows. If that's what you want, seek it there, as it's cheaper and less time-consuming.

226651,"Recent archaeological and anthropological discoveries have rendered many parts of this film innacurate and out-of-date. Despite that, it remains an engaging and involving look at early man. As the title implies, the story revolves around a primitive tribes' (the Ulams) hunt for life-giving fire. Tribesman Naoh and two others embark on a long and dangerous trek through a world rife with peril. They encounter Ika of the Ivakas (Rae Dawn Chong, in an excellent performance), who teaches them remarkable new ways to hunt (a primitive bow and arrow type weapon, comparable to the spear-throwers in Jean Auel's ""Earth's Children"" books), to make love, to laugh (one of the most delightful moments of the film) and most importantly, how to create fire.As we discover more and more about early humans, we see that they were not grunting savages, but rather, dynamic and advanced beings. This film offers a little of both. The possibility that interaction between tribes led to the spread of new technology and ideas has been vigorously debated; some support the idea that harsh climates and predators would have forced such advancements to remain localized. Personally, I agree with the filmmakers here. Also, it is likely that by 80,000 years ago our communication skills had already evolved beyond the simple grunts, hand signs, and body postures employed by the people in the film, though how far beyond is open for debate. Some authors on the subject have suggested that such a communication system was in use at an even earlier point in man's history; so, the linguistics represented in ""Quest for Fire"" are a remarkable simulation of what communication may have been like millenia before. Kudos to Anthony Burgess (""A Clockwork Orange"") and Desmond Morris (""The Naked Ape"") for an interesting--if debatable--realization of early language.Even with its possible (and proven) inaccuracies, ""Quest for Fire"" remains a dynamic and breathtaking film. It's not for the faint of heart; there are moments of bloody violence, cannibalism, and some graphic depictions of sexuality. Not surprising, given the world of early man. Jean Jacques-Annaud's direction makes good use of the beautiful locations used for the film, and some of the scenes are exhilarating. The film can pack an emotional punch, especially in the powerful and touching closing shot. As an anthropology lesson, it leaves something to be desired. But as a film and as a speculative piece on the origins of humanity, it works.",N/A

They're the world's most fearsome fighting teens...""Well, the movies, especially this one, are more closer to the original Mirage Studios comic books than they are the kids' show. But still, I thought it was cool and I still do. And when I saw it on DVD, I became ecstatic.But to be honest, the only people that would buy this DVD are the people who are about my age, to bring back the nostalgia of our late 80s to early 90s culture. I'm not kiddng, all the kids shows from that era are gone ... now. Power Rangers, which was cool when it first aired, can't get any worse than it is now. Under the Umbrella Tree, that funky Canadian show, I haven't seen it in years. Maybe they still show it in Canada, in which case I would have to take a plane there from the most farthest away place from there on this side of the border to see it. And the original TMNT cartoon isn't aired nation wide, and there are only a few lucky people that can see reruns on local stations.But at least these movies are being released on DVD, so we can remember the days of SNES and Genesis, and trying to memorize your multiplication tables.",N/A

I have always been infatuated with green skinned slave girls anyway. I've made several bids for them, but always fall short cash wise (maybe a dylithium mine would help). Wathing Susan dance half-naked in her green body paint is much too seductive for 1960s and is possibly why the series was not picked up. I can see the producers now thinking ""What the hell bloody show are you perverts trying to make? This is 1964 for crying out loud! Slave women who dance for their owners? Barbarians!""Well I sit and watch Sweet Vina dance and dance and dance. I never get tired of her. If I was Pike I would have told Spock to fly off without me. I would have made sure the aliens kept her as the 'Green Illusion' and supplied them with a whole herd of slaves to do their manual labor. Sure when you saw her in her real state she was pretty messed up, but no worse than my ex-wife when she woke up with a hangover Sunday morning. I'm glad Pike finally got to be with her. Too bad it took for him to be as messed up as Vina for them to finally be together. Rock on Captain Pike!

It's all SO well-intended and politically correct, and the story is barely believable. (How did this woman who shows up in town on foot, with only two suitcases, manage to equip and stock a confectionery store?)  I enjoyed it while it lasted, even though I felt that the movie was trying to manipulate my emotions, but it left no lasting impression.

597725,"A wonderfully entertaining movie, the 20th installment of the legendary series delivers everything anyone could ask for in a Bond film.  This 007 movie follows the formula that has made all the others a joy.There are the usual cool cars, beautiful women, nifty gadgets and outrageous actions that we all love. One scene was especially impressive and stood out among all the others in my mind, the fencing duel that bond takes part in escalades into an amazing movie experience and was worth the price of admission. Adding in some humor, based on the classic 007 flicks, really added to the atmosphere and made the movie a complete and solid package.All the Bond movies are awesome and somewhat surreal adventures that should be enjoyed and not overly criticized because of the ""that can't happen"" scenes. Of the Pierce Brosnan movies I've seen, this was my favorite to date.

705680,"This is a very fine movie in its own right. I know comparisons are made to Black Hawk Down and Saving Private Ryan, however this movie portrays the realism of Vietnam, where the others show the horrors of Somalia and World War 2. The comparison should stop there. Having served in Vietnam some 5 years after the conclusion of this battle...I have some recollections as to how these things came down. It was very hard for me to sit through this movie...the realism is very good and the acting fine. I had a small problem with Mel Gibson as Colonel Moore, sounding a bit ""John Wayneish"", almost like he patterned himself after Mr. Wayne, but aside from that he still gave a good performance.  Sam Elliot's performance as the unit's Sergeant Major is the highlight of the movie and although some of it is lighthearted in the early part of the movie, his character is totally believable. I would hope that those who wanted to know more about Vietnam would see this movie, and I would hope that those who are afraid it would bring back memories would see it too, we need not forget these men whom so bravely gave their lives for our country, as they have in all wars and as they do now, and I would hope that in the last few moments of the movie , when they show the casualties from this battle and the fact that there were 58,000 more, that each viewer would take a little more pride in who we are as Americans and as patriots, and what that means.",N/A

120258,"Loud, raucous, and at times indecipherable, Any Given Sunday is director Oliver Stone's best movie in years. After all, all of Stone's pictures are loud, raucous and at times indecipherable. Off hand, I can think of three kinds of movies that are supposed to be this way - action movies, war movies and football movies. This incisive look at a pro football team undergoing a make or break period is, in my opinion, the best picture about the game ever made.The movie opens in the middle of a game that is going badly for the Miami Sharks. The team is on a losing streak and really need a win. To make matters worse, star quarterback Jack Rooney [Dennis Quaid] suffers a major back injury. Coach Tony D'Amato [Al Pacino] has no choice but to send in third string quarterback, Willie Beaman [Jamie Foxx], who blows enough plays to cause the team to lose. Up in a posh sky box, owner and general manager Christina Pagniacci [Cameron Diaz] is furious. Christina's deceased father founded the team, and D'Amato has led it to many victorious seasons in his thirty years as coach. This means little to Christina, a ruthless businessperson, whose goal is to sell the franchise. She can't get top dollar for a losing team. There is not an ounce of sentimentality, much less sympathy, in this woman. By the next game, D'Amato has worked his magic on Beaman, who turns out to be a great football player after all. Success soon goes to his head, however, and he becomes an egotistical nightmare for the coach and the team. Rooney is trying to get well enough to return for the playoffs, but in his heart, he knows he's getting too old for the game. Another back injury could land him in a wheelchair permanently.There is much more to Any Given Sunday's story, but it is the movie's drive and the great acting that make it so good. Nobody can play a man in the twilight of his glory better than Al Pacino. Cameron Diaz is so good as the heartless Christina that she's almost scary. Jamie Foxx gives a career making performance as Willie Beaman, while LL Cool J is first-rate as Julian Washington, a star player who's had one concussion too many.The film has been criticized for the fast, jumpy edits involving the action on the field, though I really liked them. The idea is not to sit and watch football plays. The idea is to put the viewer on the field with the players, and Oliver Stone achieved this. These scenes are so intense that I came away feeling a bit bruised myself. There have also been complaints that the movie's producers couldn't get the NFL to cooperate. If the NFL had done so, the result would have been as squeak clean as the war movies the Department of Defense used to approved of. What Stone does is to portray the players as modern day gladiators. He also pulls no punches in dealing with the issues of money, fame and the abuse of power and of privilege. His Miami Sharks may not be representative of pro football on the whole, but the team does have problems and issues which often do occur in real life.",N/A
528836,"I avoided seeing this one for ages because I assumed from the previews it would be another ""kids are cool - adults are stupid"" piece of trash. What was I thinking?Every now and then a movie grabs me, and I watch the DVD literally every day for a couple of months. Contact. L.A. Confidential. 54. That sort of thing. And now, Almost Famous. This movie works on so many levels and rings so absolutely true from start to finish that you don't watch it, you live it. If you were around in the 70's, and you didn't live under a rock, you knew this world, in the same way that a young boy feels he knows the players on his favorite baseball team. I read Creem Magazine all the time. It was like a sacrament. At last, I get to see the other side, the lives of not only the people who wrote those sacred words, but also the people they wrote them about.Although there is plenty of star power here, all the monumentally talented actors are still unknown enough to bring nothing but talent to their roles. There's no star baggage or hype. Even Kate Hudson, the archtypical Hollywood insider, is fresh and new and utterly believable. The exception, of course, is Frances McDormand. As an Oscar winner and three time nominee, she's nobody's unknown, but her gift for loosing herself in memorable roles shines again as the mother of a young Carmeron Crowe-like character angsting over the sudden maturity thrust upon her prodigal son.There are moments; the band on a bus singing ""Tiny Dancer"", the guitarist on the roof proclaiming ""I am a Golden God"" (once uttered in real life by Robert Plant), and just about every scene with Patrick Fugit, who is nothing short of amazing, where this movie transcends its medium, its message, and becomes something much more. It's a time portal and a crystal ball and a backstage pass all in one. It lets you relive your childhood and fill in the parts that were denied to you the first time around.Don't miss this movie, and don't wait too long before you see it. You've waited far too long already, and in a magic instant it could be the 70's for you all over again, only better.",Almost Famous
178751,"Certain Director's have improved their films over the years by adding extra footage cut when it was released or placing digital enhancements (Star Trek I, Terminator 2, and L&eacute;on- The Professional are happy examples).  However, this wasn't necessarily the case with Legend.  The top reason to buy this DVD is because it comes with both the Origional Version and the US Theatrical Version.  The other would be the myriad of technical details, the making of, and publicity photos along with Commentaries common on many DVD releases.The Director's Cut of this film has Jerry Goldsmith's origional score and alternate scenes along with reattached footage.  I welcome the extra footage because it can fill out certain parts of the story, but the reason why Goldsmith's score was replaced by Tangerine Dream's in the first place was because the music was dry, quiet and dull in someplaces (but not all), especially the dancing scene and closing.  Other parts, like the beginning where Darkness was ordering his minion had given me mixed feelings.  Him announcing his weakness to daylight early and the missing hellish butchering scene disappoined me, but I like the way we didn't see what Darkness looked like until much later, offering an element of mystery.  At the same time, the familar beginning is prefered and should be intact especially when we all know what Darkness looks like anyway.What gets me is the alternate ending.  The end of Darkness was too short and the awakening of Lily was too long, yet incomplete and empty.If Ridley Scott just added extra footage to the US Theatrical version, leaving in Tangerine Dream with some Goldsmith in some parts for the dark moods and left the beginning and ending with what we are famliar with, this would leave us with a happy medium and a good Director's Cut.",N/A

Also noteworthy is the great cinematography and the bold use of color.  On the downside, the &quot;documentary&quot; which features interviews with cast members is abominable.  The film is choppily edited and fast motion is used in one section, I suppose to create a &quot;cool&quot; and &quot;hip&quot; effect.

I feel this movie should be seen by everyone. The performances by Tammy Blanchard and Judy Davis are knockout performances. When you watch the film you really fall into Judy's world and Life. You feel her pain and her joys. her broken hearts and her love. One of the really great things about this film is that her real singing voice was used, both Tammy and Judy lip synced to the classic recordings. I love how authentic the costumes were they are exactly like they did in the original films. The most heart renching scene is where Judy is in her Dressing room with her husband vincente Minnelli right before they film ""The Trolley Song"" and she's in tears saying ""I Can't Be Judy Garland Today"" and another really great moment is when CBS Chews her out and she stood up for herself and her TV show.I knew she loved her children but it this film It really came across and you knew that Liza Minnelli and Lorna Luft were her world. They ment everything to her.

416094,"...I believe the knuckleheads who claim this is what their life is like just as much as I believe the people who make the same claim about the television show 'Friends'.  Our protagonists are a pair of mush-mouthed idiots, Telly and Casper, who engage in alcohol abuse, drug abuse, sexual abuse/rape, petty theft and assault as a lifestyle.  We all know that adolescence can seem pretty grim, but we are given no reason at all to sympathize with or identify with these two or any of the film's other characters.  We just watch the boys bully their female friends, parents, local shopkeepers and anybody else who enters the frame.  That said, I really didn't find this to be a 'wake up call' to anything no matter how stridently its proponents howl.  I'm already well aware of what happens to children when they are raised by Viacom/MTV instead of mommy and daddy.  And although this film may be an exaggeration of those consequences, we only see the effect on society.  From Kids, the message continues to be that crime is cool, urban culture is the only culture (as evidenced by the list of trendy concerns in the special thanks section of the credits), and you won't be held accountable for your actions.  The only thing really shocking about this movie was watching Telly try to taste the stomach contents of his victims.  Gross.  But I did sit through the whole thing, and probably will again.",N/A

Ryan, of course, is the only man who knows the truth as must save he world from nuclear destruction.  Redundant?  Yes.

111289,"Nothing much to add, as most reviewers have pointed out how ""Stealing Home"" came to touch our hearts in some way or another. Yet I want to express some of my feelings after watching this movie once again, this time on DVD. 1. The DVD itself kind of let me down due to its lack of so many features I'd expected (commentaries, producer's notes, deleted scenes etc...) Hopefully Warner Bros. will release a special or collector's edition to make up for that. 2. I may be wrong, but ""Stealing Home"" obviously tends to become a ""classic"" -- in the sense that it brings up a lot of memories or nostalgic sentiments to the viewer, just like what ""Summer of '42"" or ""The Big Chill"" always does to me. That being said, I got myself a pleasant surprise while going over all the reviews on Amazon.com and found one written by Katie Kampmann -- who played ""baby Hope"" and whom the main character played by Jodie Foster was actually named after. If this wonderful movie grows with the ""real"" Katie, well, it also grows with many other people -- no doubt about it.

680142,"""Stone Cold Steve Austin What"" chronicles Steve Austin's 2001 WWF year through a combined mix of interviews and video footage.  In addition to chronicling his year 2001, the video also takes a quick look back at his time in the old WCW.  Overall, while the feature can be criticized for its brevity (with a runtime of approximately an hour) it is a decent review of his year 2001.THE FEATURE:The feature reviews the following:1 - His feud with Triple H during the beginning of 2001, in particular their Match of the Year at No Way Out 20012 - His feud with the Rock for the WWF title3 - His heel turn4 - His quick feud with Chris Benoit5 - His lead role in the ill-fated Invasion angle6 - His awesome feud with Kurt Angle7 - A handful of the comedy sketches he did on WWF TV in 2001 with Vince McMahon and Kurt Angle8 - His appearance on MadTV9 - A quick look at his WCW career as ""Stunning Steve"" with interviews by Ric Flair and Arn Anderson and footage of Ricky Steamboat and Brian Pillman.10 - How he came up with his ""WHAT???"" catchphrase (you'll be surprised how it developed).THE DVD FEATURES:WWE is starting to put out better extras on their DVDs.  It's good to see they are putting SOME use to the WCW footage they acquired in the buyout.  Here's the rundown of the extras on this DVD:1. ""Stone Cold Steve Austin vs. Triple H"" No Way Out 2001.  THE Match of the Year of 2001.  2 out of 3 Falls Match (Regular, Street Fight, Steel Cage).  Talk about intensity and athleticism. 5 stars.2. Coronation speech from King of the Ring 1996.  Witness the birth of ""Austin 3:16.""3. ""Stunning"" Steve Austin vs. Ricky ""The Dragon"" Steamboat, Bash at the Beach 1994.  Austin's favorite match against his favorite worker.  Actually, from what I understand Austin wanted the match from the Clash of Champions against Steamboat.  Oh well.  Decent 23 minute bout.  3  stars4. Extra Interviews:1) ""Origins of 3:16"" Austin gives his thoughts on the catchphrase.2) Arn Anderson:  1 minute spot where AA talks about a trip to Japan with Austin.3) Camera Guy:  2 minute spot with the camera guy talking about his relationship with Stone Cold4) Wildlife:  1 minute 30 seconds.  Austin talks about his ranch animals.5) ""Back on the Ranch"":  3 minutes.  Austin talks his pets and the types of food and music he likes.THE CRITICISM:While the feature is decent, the one limiting thing about it (and this applies to just about ALL WWF/E DVDs) is the one hour time limit.  There is just SOOOO much more that they can include on these but don't.  Some of the other things they could have included:1. More on his WCW career (including more bonus matches).  They have the footage.2. His feud with RVD during the Invasion.3. His feud with Booker T.4. More bonus matches.THE VERDICT:Aside from these criticisms, the feature is OKAY.  The stuff they do put on is quality and it is a decent watch for Austin/WWE fans.  The bonus matches make this a worthwhile viewing/purchase.Recommended",N/A

Juliette Binoche is quite charming as the chocolatiere who's getting everyone worked up but managing to subdue them all with just the right kind of truffle or cocoa.

Depp is sexy as a gypsy guy who manages to be slightly a step ahead of Binoche, disconcerting her as the only one who's favorite chocolate she can't quite detect.I think it's interesting how many other reviewers are angry that Johnny Depp didn't have a larger role than his billing would have you believe, but I think the true qualifier for that dubious honor would be Leslie Caron.

389940,"In 1961 TWO WOMEN was considered a shocker; over time, however, we have seen the trauma central to the film depicted on screen so often and so much more graphically that many will feel the film has lost its edge.  Even so, Sophia Loren's justly famous performance is powerful enough to keep one focused on the film, and she is extremely well supported with strong performances by the likes of Eleonora Brown, Jean-Paul Belmondo, and Raf Vallone.  De Sica's very simple, unpretentious presentation also continues to serve the film extremely well.Loren is a widow who runs a small grocery store in Rome during World War II, and when the war moves in upon the city she decides to take daughter Rosetta (Brown) to the small village where she herself was born, but safety proves elusive.  The trip to the village is frought with danger, and although the villagers have some safety in their isolation even they are subject to peril.  When the Allies begin to close in on Rome, Loren decides to return to the city on foot with her daughter--and unwittingly places both her and her daughter at the mercy of renegade soliders who, in a scene once considered extraordinary violent, rape both mother and daughter in a bombed out church.Loren's performance here is simply extraordinary, and she gives us a woman of peasant mentality who has acquired a somewhat urban edge through her life as a shopkeeper in Rome, totally believable in her tunnel-visioned toughness; if any one ever had doubts that Hollywood essentially wasted her talents, they need look no further than this film for proof.  Unfortunately, however, one need only look at the reviews here to realize how incredibly bad the prints of this film are.  And not to put too fine a point on it, the Madacy release (which shows Loren and Brown in black and white on the cover) is easily one of the most incredibly shoddy videotapes it has ever been my misfortune to encounter: the picture slips in and out of focus, is consistently grainy, and the sound quality is atrocious.  This is a film in desperate need of restoration--but until that happens, fans of world cinema will have to put up with it, for this is an important film that should be seen.

As we watch ""the Champ"" emerge from poverty, aching to hit the big time, we understand why he would make a Faustian bargain with the sleazy big-time boxing promoter.  The Champ figures he'll be smart and shrewd enough to be the one pulling the strings, but of course he is deluded, and when the promoter tells him to lose a big fight, the Champ finally has to wrestle with his conscience.  The big fight is the movie's spectacular climax.My two main complaints are that the Champ's girlfriend Peg (played by Lilli Palmer) is a stock character: the wholesome girl who tries to guide her boyfriend down the right path and waits like an angel, ready to forgive all, for her wayward boyfriend to return to her fold.  Also, the ending is a cop-out.  PLOT SPOILER TO FOLLOW.  While it is inspiring to see the Champ refuse to throw the fight, we know that as a result the promoter probably will try to kill him, so the happy ending as the Champ and Peg walk off in each other's arms after the big fight is premature.  The point of the film is that the Champ's reckless actions had gotten himself into a no-win situation: either he would throw the fight and lose his integrity or he would not throw the fight and would lose his life.  The film's happy ending covers over that tragedy and dilutes the moral of the story.",Body and Soul VHS
397083,"This vampire movie is possibly the most modern of its kind.  It has Taylor as a university student who is vamped in a back alley.  Soon after she finds that sunglight is an issue and she's drawing blood from tramps.  What makes it so modern is the fact that vampirism is used as a metaphor for both AIDS and drugs, with the 'disease' being passed from one person to another.  Later on there are scenes of Taylor injecting herself with a 'fix' of blood.  The Addiction takes the vampire movie out of Anne Rice territory and places it as a horrific urban myth.Taylor really is superb in just about every role she plays, but here she's the leading part.  This is particularly rare for an actress best known for her supporting roles.  Strangely enough, the big name Annabella Sciorra has a relatively small part, although she does have a dominating presence for the scenes she is in.Alongside its vampirism though are questions about the soul and redemption.  Perhaps the most intriguing idea that the movie has is that guilt is eternal and that people are drawn to sin because they are doomed already.  It is a rare movie of this genre that has a few ideas in its head, and also a rare one that is virtually incomparable to others of its type.  Obviously it won't be to everyone's taste, but its use of haunting imagery and different perspective on the vampire genre should be applauded.","Addiction, The VHS"

Unless you are familiar with Kathy Smith's communication style, you may be lost the first time around, trying to figure out which weights to use when--her cues tend to fly by. The simultaneous two track work out is a bit confusing at first, too. A word to beginners who don't possess a lot of upper body strength:  start with 2, 3 and 5 pound weights, and take it easy with those 5's. And don't worry if you don't make it through the first time.  You will eventually.",N/A
697845,"Not to say that Anderson is a genius, but he's certainly one-of-a-kind. This nerdy auteur is batting a thousand on my scorecard. With BOTTLE ROCKET, RUSHMORE and now with THE ROYAL TENENBAUMS, Anderson and his cohorts (especially the Wilson bros.) prove that smart movies can also be fun and incredibly entertaining. And RT is definitely all three and then some. As in RUSHMORE I am amazed at how much background he gives each character, usually with a simple montage, and even more so here as this ensemble cast is rather large. These are fully fleshed out creations who you know are living their lives in some parallel world right now. The dialogue is brilliant, the performances are top notch (although Murray's character is a bit of a throwaway), and the set/costume design create a strangely unfamiliar New York City (we know the movie takes place in the present because of the G4 Macs, etc., but it feels timeless and anachronistic). The tragi-comic situations that the characters go through rival those of characters in books by the likes of John Irving and Kurt Vonnegut. This also gives the movie (like RUSHMORE again) a more literary than cinematic feel. If this had been a book I would have loved it. As a movie it's simply marvelous. My official rating is four and a half stars, and I am already anxiously awaiting the DVD release.",The Royal Tenenbaums
519905,"The first installment of The Lord of the Rings trilogy is fantastically realized, lushly shot, and as intense as a three hour movie can get. Elijah Wood is convincing as Frodo Baggins,the good-natured and stout-hearted hobbit who unwillingly comes into the possession of the ring tht can rule the world.  Ian McKellan portrays a wise and kindly Gandalf with so much humanity that the viewer needs him as much as Frodo does.  The other actors likewise inhabit their roles with confidence, although none quite as distinctively.The scenery, both manufactured and real (shot in New Zealand), serves as a convincing Middle Earth.  Even the music contributes powerfully to the overall effect (save a &quot;Titanic&quot;-like flute piece to accompany a water scene near the end.)So why only four stars?  Because this utterly accomplished film fails to deliver any kind of resolution.  I understand this is but one of three movies already shot; still, I strongly believe each should be able to stand on its own as a separate work.  Otherwise, it's a nine hour movie to be released over three years.  Even though the action itself could not be resolved, there should have been some kind of emotional resolution to give the viewer a firm sense of why it ended where it did.  Instead, the credits start rolling after perhaps one of the most banal lines of the entire three hours. I wasn't the only person in the theater to say, &quot;Is that ALL?&quot;Even so, this is a movie not to be missed.  Once all three films are available, you will be glad to have seen the first installment.  People have compared this to &quot;Harry Potter&quot;, also released this season, but &quot;The Fellowship of the Ring&quot; aims for, and achieves, a much higher level of film making.(Parents note:  This movie is not for elementary school children, even those accustomed to violent fare. The intensity of evil and fear can be nearly overwhelming.)",The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring
268900,"Much  has already been written about this story already but I would like to add my twopence worth. Another fantastic (in every sense of the word) story which sees the expansion of the typical doctor storyline to incorporate eatern religion and mysticism. In some ways the story harks back to the early days of the Doctor where a historical interlude was often to be found sandwiched in between the more fantastic science fiction escapades. But this particular Doctor had more darker episodes than most and I think this one is particularly so.Predating Stargate by some considerable years, the show postulates a race of immortal beings with a bad apple among them. His crimes were so heinous that he is sentenced to life imprisonment as the other immortals were so reluctant to take any life no matter how evil the crime. Upon gaining his freedom he will destroy all.Human life counts for nothing as the evil one battles the Doctor to secure his escape and even the will of a Timelord is insufficient to defeat him. In the end, as always the Doctor wins through and sends Sutek to finish off his sentence in a time loop. While we all cheer for his demise it is easy to forget the cruelty of  such a fate and while it may be poetic justice, we should not forget that there are some things worse than death.One of my personal favourites which ranks with the Robots of Death - two thumbs up!",Doctor Who - Pyramids of Mars VHS

572395,"There are a number of amazing things in this video. This DVD dates back to a time when peaceful competition between national teams was what everyone expected in the Munich Olympic Games of 1972, and even the 1999 Academy Award for Best Documentary Feature was before 9/11/2001 made the war on terrorism a daily concern for more people than had previously worried about how the rest of the world matters. Whoever expected to see a documentary in which a group of Germans decided that they were about to engage in a suicide mission and unanimously voted not to attempt what they had been planning to do? People who are inclined to keep track of how often governments lie might be interested in who first announced that the hostages had all been saved, and the terrorists killed. It becomes obvious during the film that one terrorist is still alive, on camera, and you can almost see who he is.The ending of the film was most remarkable for me. Some government maintains such close contact with the terrorist organizations that it was able, within a few weeks, to arrange a hijacking of a flight to Frankfurt that could be used as a cover for the release of the three survivors, in the interest of maintaining peace with the Palestinian cause for which an enormous amount of publicity had been generated by the event. Few will doubt that two of those survivors have probably died as a result of assassination teams, and it is likely that some government is keeping track of who has been getting killed, so the identity of the survivor at the end is only a secret for people who don't need to know. You can learn a lot else from watching this, and you can even listen to a few lines in German.  There might be German subtitles for people who know how to pick the setting.  There weren't many other DVD options, but the English subtitles hepled me a lot.",One Day in September 1999

594353,"Resident Evil is from the source movie goers have learned to fear most--video games.  Resident Evil joins the glittering pantheon of such other video game to movie translations such as Tomb Raider, Final Fantasy, Street Fighter, Mortal Kombat, and even Super Mario Brothers.  It's certainly better than most of these but still is far from being a great horror film.The original game started with the simple and uncluttered premise of being stuck in an isolated mansion with mysterious flesh eating mutated zombies and assorted other biological abberations that had to be fought past in order to find out that the whole mess originated from corporate experimentation in biological weaponry.  The game showed through clever use of shock effects, disturbing dramatic camera angles, and cinematic music that video games could be as scary and suspenseful as any horror film. In this way the game was a groundbreaker and amazingly influential and popular.Now several years and game sequels later we have Resident Evil the movie.  The film clutters up the premise quite a bit.  Beginning with some unexplained corporate espionage that causes a spooky HAL like computer to kill everyone in the Umbrella building (or as it is explained later an underground hive) it cuts immediately to a half naked Milla Jovovich (she of the crazy red hair in The Fifth Element) waking up with amnesia in a shower and wandering alone in a strangely deserted palatial mansion that the computer is also monitoring.Where are the zombies?They do eventually show up and the creators of this film also borrow heavily from past successes such as Aliens, The Matrix, 2001:A Space Odyssey, and maybe even a little Memento.  The result is a mess and some of the action is incomprehensible sometimes it seems certain characters make their escapes out of impossible situations by simply being edited out of them. But the movie keeps moving frenetically and sometimes entertainingly along anyway.  The rest of the plot revolves around the mystery of the sabotage and a trip down into the sealed hive to solve the mystery.Fans of the video games will be disappointed to not see Chris Redfield or Jill Valentine make an appearance.  Also zombies, hunters and mutant dogs are pretty much the only mutant monsters you get.As far as the cast goes moviegoers will be left mainly remembering Jovovich's charming beauty and Michelle Rodriguez's(from the much superior low budget Girlfight) tough funny turn as one of the band of clean up soldiers who accompany Jovovich down into the hive.  Sure its a lift of Private Vasquez's character from Aliens but Rodriguez has such a gritty delivery that she makes the tired dialogue sound fresh and intentionally amusing.The thudding rock score by Marilyn Manson does little to help and the various creatures are not imaginative enough to really inspire any horror.  There are various shock effects tactics employed throughout the film to keep moviegoers from getting restless.The movie is an okay ride and probably worth a peak if you're a big zombie or Resident Evil fan.  Most of us will get more out of watching Aliens again.",N/A
255298,"I'm surprised they're bothering to release this film on DVD. This movie is dreadful, and that's coming from a 'Weird Al' fan. The plot isn't worth describing, because the movie is a collage of sketches, most of them juvenile and stupid. Of course, juvenile is what you expect from 'Weird Al', so that's not really the problem. The problem is that 95% of the jokes don't work. That's not just my opinion, that was the general public consensus, as the film bombed and Weird Al's career took some time to recover. There are some attempts to be satirical, but most of them are too broad to have any bite. If your idea of funny is someone getting hacked apart by Conan for turning in a library book late, perhaps this film will appeal, but for me, there was exactly one amusing gag: Spatula City -- a giant warehouse emporium full of spatulas of all sizes and varieties.

He and his girlfriend are then stalked by menacing demons and inanimate objects that come to life. What a great excuse to throw blood and gore all over the screen.

Now it's been said that Lucas intentioanlly made the first film a light one, in anticipation of the much more darker films to follow.  That's fine with me, but the problems still continue to leap out at me evry time I watch it.  It's clear Darth Maul is a professional swordsman (which is why he has little dialogue), unfortunatly it becomes all to clear in the fight scenes that this guy could easily take out our heroes in about 3 seconds.  Midiclorians??? Why in God's name does Hollywood think we need an actual explanation for the force?  It was the force's mystical and unknown qualities that made the first films special in the first place.  And don't even get me started with Jar Jar.

715868,"""Faithless"" is a film that explores love, infidelity, guilt, pain, and humanity. The film was written by world-renowned director, Ingmar Bergman, and directed by Liv Ullman, an accomplished Swedish actress who is also Bergman's former wife.The film begins with an old, retired film director named Bergman (Erland Josephson) who summons his muse in order to write a screenplay. At first invisible and reluctant to show herself, Bergman's muse eventually appears as Marianne (Lena Endre) his former wife. Marianne slowly discusses her previous marriage to a famous composer, Markus (Thomas Hanzon), and the subsequent events that resulted in her leaving him for his friend and artistic collaborator, David (Krister Hendriksson) who is also the younger Bergman. The conversation takes place over several days in Bergman's seaside house and assumes the form of flashbacks. The story is not a happy one, and exploring it is clearly a painful experience for Marianne, and for Bergman who for, perhaps the first time, is able to empathize with her and is able to view his own role from the perspective of detached wisdom and sorrow.Faithless remains a penetrating and honest psychological exploration from start to finish and closely resembles Bergman's earlier films in style and temperament (although this one is directed by Liv Ullman). This film contains its share of difficulties, but if viewers, especially American viewers can get past them they will find it enormously rewarding. Some of the difficulties of this film are:LENGTH""Faithless is ""142"" minutes of largely dialog with subtitles. Even if you're into idea-oriented films, it takes a lot of commitment and stamina to pay close attention to this one.STYLEThis film is almost like a cinematic play. The plot unfolds almost completely through dialog. While it has its share of symbols and devices, they are very restrained. There is no slick action, or special affects, and there are no obvious heroes or villains.SUBTLETYBergman and Ullman are not trying to pound blunt ideas into our heads with obvious characters and a simple plot. Many of the ideas in this film are subtle and even paradoxical. It raises many disturbing questions and provides practically no obvious answers. One thing that might help is to think of this film as an exploration, or an important conversation that we get to overhear, but not as a product designed to gratify and amuse us (that's what ""Star Wars"" is for).The powerful and rewarding thing about ""Faithless"" is that it relentlessly explores universal emotional and psychological truths that apply to all of us. Many of the terrible things we do in life have no concrete material or circumstantial justification but they do have a powerful emotional one that is almost impossible to explain. Marianne has no immediate justification for leaving Markus, who is a good husband and who pleases her in bed. Yet at the same time she feels no choice but to succumb to the emotional change that slowly and inexorably draws her to David. One day she simply sees him as a different person altogether, and her life takes on a drastic new momentum.If you can accept the lengthy, conversational nature of this film and are not phased by the parts of it that may seem incomprehensible or alienating, you will recognize yourself in much of it. It is unlikely that the characters, all leading members of Swedish artistic circles, resemble any of us. But we will see bits of ourselves in their emotions, their actions, and in their struggle to explain the incompressible workings of the human soul. Stick it out and see it twice if you can. It's worth it.",N/A
586427,"The preview for this movie looks kinda like a cheesy action movie, which is why I didn't go and see in the theaters, but I was always wondering about that, since Denzel Washington is in it.  When I heard that he got an Oscar for it I realized I was totally wrong.  This was no cheesy movie, probably one of the most realistic action movies I have in a great while, but without Denzel, or a great ending, this movie would have suffered.Denzel plays a veteran narcotics cop or a ""NARC,""  Who brings Ethan Hawke, a rookie who wants to be a cop in narcotics around for a day, to see if he is worthy of being on Denzel's squad.  From the first time you see Denzel, you know exactly why he got that Oscar, his acting preformance is absolutley spectacular.  And as the movie goes further and further,  Denzel keeps getting more and more suspicious, what kind of cop has wife that lives in the projects?  Then it all leads up to a great ending, which I do not want to give away, for I would entirely ruin the movie for you.  That is what makes the movie so great, Denzel's acting and the great ending, without either of these, this movie would have been totally horrible, it probably would have been that cheesy movie I thought it was.  Oh yeah, Ethan Hawke's preformance ain't half bad either.So anyways, I suggest you go out and rent this movie, especially if you are looking for another great action movie that has hardly a single cliche.

As you can tell, I've been totally immersed and addicted to '24' and you will too, especially if you watch it over 24 hours or over a single weekend.  For fans of action especially that with elements of political intrigue and family drama, this is a wet dream come true.In terms of quality of acting/action, I would give it four stars.  Keifer Sutherland is perfect for the role of director of counter-terrorism who frequently departs from department protocol.  His associates, as well as the first-family-to-be and the terrorists all do a fantastic job.  The plot is filled with all kinds of twists and subplots while managing for the most part to be believable to a CNN-conscious audience.  The subject matter and the themes in the '24' are extremely relevant to our time.It gets a fifth star because it's such a great value.  Although [it] might seem a bit pricey at first, what you're getting is the equivalent of 12 movies for the price of 2.  And it has replay value beyond watching it in one weekend or lending it to friends.  See it the first time for the suspense, the second time as a mystery to look for clues with the ending in mind, and a third time just to see the action again.  The only reason I did not follow the entire series when it was on TV was because I don't like cliffhanger endings in between episodes, but that's why '24' was made for DVD because then you don't have to wait a week to see what happened next.

Mourning beyond reason, the shattered couple goes to Venice, where Sutherland repeatedly sees visions of his dead daughter, always just out of reach.Through disjointed stream-of-consciousness images, gorgeous views of Venice, lush colors, eerie people with second sight, and one of the most erotic love scenes on film, we feel this couple's anguish, fear and desperate love for one another.

22326,"A quick primer -- Kevin Smith is the tiny indie director/comic book fan who managed to land deals with Miramax and Universal and has made five of the best, funniest movies of the past decade.Dogma is the fourth of these five films, and is every bit as good as anything Smith has ever done. The story focuses on a pair of fallen angels (Affleck and Damon) who find a loophole to allow them to get back into Heaven -- which, of course, will unmake all existance. (It makes sense in context, trust me) It's up to Linda Fiorentino to stop them -- with the help of a muse (Salma Hayek), the 13th Apostle (Chris Rock) and a pair of unlikely prophets in the form of Smith's constant goofball heroes, Jay and Silent Bob (Jason Mewes and Smith himself, respectively). Alan Rickman also does a great turn as Metatron, the voice of God.A lot of people griped about this movie, saying it was anti-Church, anti-Catholic... but as a practicing Catholic myself, let me tell you, this is perhaps the most faith-AFFIRMING movie I've ever seen. While this movie certainly isn't for everyone, anyone who appreciates Smith's sense of humor will love a movie that leaves you feeling that God exists, God is good, and if we'd all just lighten up things would be a heck of a lot better in this world.This special edition makes the movie even better, letting you see the stuff Smith (wisely) left on the cutting room floor. A lot of it is great stuff, but it simply would have disrupted the flow of the movie. Still, the &quot;Fat Albert&quot; deleted scene alone is worth the price of the set.Oh -- and good luck finding the two hysterical Easter Eggs -- &quot;How Mewes thinks Kevin directs&quot; and &quot;How Kevin actually directs.&quot;",N/A

595493,"Y Tu Mama Tambien is a solid film about the bond between two teenage boys and how that bond is challenged when a woman comes between them. The two boys meet one of their(unhappily)married female cousins at a family function and just on a whim the boys ask her to join them for a week at a remote beach. To their surprise she agrees.One thing that keeps the story interesting and gives it its unique perspective is that the movie is spiced throughout with little narrative asides which comment on the course different lives take. The boys are young and full of energy and enthusiasm. The slightly older and very sexy cousin at first seems like the summers big score but soon the boys are at odds with each other as they each try to win her attention and then they are odds with each other when they must confront the ""truths"" of their own friendship.As the movie progresses the two boys story of innocence and the end of it is contrasted with the cousins story of experience and her desire for a last taste of the innocence the boys will soon be losing. The film feels very loose and free capturing the boys in moments of fun as well as moments of conflict but it is very well constructed. Many films try to capture youth and never seem to get it right but this one gets both the passion and the pain of being on the cusp of adulthood just right. It also gets the pain and passion of early adulthood just right as well as the cousin and her unique situation and how she deals with it is just as memorable and central to the film as the two boys story is.It has the feel of a light and breezy comedy in parts and yet in other parts it offers the insight associated with a serious drama. A rare and honest and bold study of what youth feels like. Very nearly a perfect movie. And a great soundtrack. And great cinematography. And yes it is very very sexy! Offering interesting insight into the different forms passion can take.",Y Tu Mama Tambien

He spends huge amounts of money trying to get a title, and in the end loses everthing including a leg. Yes it has no contemporary relevance to anything.The strong point of the film is the photography. The sets, the costumes are all great. However it is like a slow moving tableau rather than a film. The things which make films interesting are some plot, a bit of pace and maybee some issues which are interesting.This film seems to go for at least three hours, maybee it goes for two. It is hard to work up any enthusiasm for the hero as he is such a groveller to the upper class. I mean other people did different things in the time it was set.

314369,"With its tongue firmly planted in cheek, Casino Royale takes viewers on a wild ride through the spy business. David Niven plays the retired James Bond (who despises what his successor with the same name has been doing on behalf of the UK). The plot is little more than an excuse to cobble together 5 different segements (with 5 different directors including John Huston who appears in a cameo).The funnest segment involves Peter Sellers as James Bond. He projects confidence so well in his witty performance that you'd almost expect him to play the role in a Real Bond Film. His scenes with Orson Welles very from mildly entertaining to rip roaring funny. Welles was reportedly irritated with Sellers during the making of the film so most of his material was shot with Seller's around (Seller's made fun of Welles girth and continually bated him during the production).Although it hasn't aged as gracefully as some the Flint films (which still work very well as satire), Casion Royale still works well enough to enjoy. In many respects, it's a predecessor to the Austin Powers movies and plays like that film crossed with It's A Mad, Mad, Mad World.Although Casino Royale is a lot of lightweight fun, it's not as good a spoof as its producers seem to think. James Coburn was actually funnier in the two Our Man Flint spy spoofs. Casino Royale is a notch below Flint and above the Dean Martin Matt Helm films.A pity there was no way include a cameo of Sean Connery (the film's producers were not the producers of the Bond series. Casino Royale was the only Fleming book that they owned. That's one of the reasons they elected to go in a satirical direction with the film as anything else would have resulted in lawsuits). It's also a pity that the various directors are no longer around  to include a commentary track. Most of the principles are dead so it's no surprise that there's no commentary track from them as well.Casino Royale is an enjoyable romp as long as you check your expectations at the door. While time hasn't been as kind to it as it has been to some of the Bond & Flint films, it was clearly ahead of its time.",Casino Royale

239455,"Like many folks here, I saw this one when I was very young--right after second grade, I think. By the time it came to the theater in my little rural hometown a year after its release, Julie Andrews had already won an Oscar for her work as the title character.  Not that that mattered.  To the kids in my class at school, this was the hot, must-see movie of that summer--the way ""Star Wars"" would be in the next decade.  I can still remember laughing over Dick Van Dyke tap-dancing with the penguins and crying during the ""Bird Woman"" song (which was as much social commentary as a sentimental tune about our feathered friends). I became a fan of Dick Van Dyke's show after this--he basically won my heart as Bert--the jack-of-all-trades special friend to Mary and the Banks' children.  For the rest of that summer, man, I WAS Mary Poppins.  My mom bought me a record of all the songs, I used her old Avon sample case as my carpetbag, and I acted out the movie every day. If VCRs and DVDs had been everyday household items then, I would have asked for ""Mary Poppins"" for Christmas. (It would have been worn out by Easter, most likely!)As happens to children almost overnight, my interests changed over the next year and I sort of got over my fixation with Mary, Bert, et. al.  After all, Julie Andrews and Dick Van Dyke went on to other things after that, so why not me?And then in the 90s, Disney re-released ""Mary Poppins"" as a video.  I bought it for my daughter (or at least that was the excuse I gave my husband).  Though she was too young to understand everything in the movie--just as I was the first time I saw it--she, too, loved ""Mary Poppity"" as she called it.  We must have played it at least 3 times a week during the first summer we had it, while living in temporary housing and waiting for our house to be built.  She, too, loves to act this one out and to sing the songs for hours on end.  The apple does not fall far from the tree, I guess.As for me. . .it's all I remembered it to be, and then some. For starters, the music. . .what was missing from the old record I had were the overture, underscores, and closing score--they were beautifully put together.  And the little details are delightful, too.  Among them:  Mrs. Banks, who is a feminist (at least when Mr. Banks isn't around) wears bloomers--and later in the movie, we discover Mary Poppins does, too.  (don't blink, or you'll miss seeing them)  The relationship between Mary and Bert. . .as a child I thought they were probably a couple but never had time to see each other because of their work.  Now?  I think they would be a couple if they got a lucky break.  Let's face it--she's a nanny and he's a lower-level tradesman.  Even if they did get married,  in 1910, the realities of British society were such that if you weren't part of the gentry, you worked for a living, and changing your ""class"" or status didn't happen.  A shame, because their characters obviously love children very much.  So they do the next best thing--work together as a team to bring happiness to British middle-class homes--mainly by shaking up the parents.  Mary was no ordinary nanny, but Bert made her an even better one--he was the idea man, and she handled the implementation.And therein is the secret:  this movie was not as much about Mary, Bert, and the kids as it is about Mary, Bert, and Mr. and Mrs. Banks.  It's when Mr. Banks realizes that his children don't need a nanny to be happy--they just need their parents to love them and give them their attention--that he also becomes the man that the Bank needs.  The scene between Bert and Mr. Banks at the house is one of the best in the movie.As for the ending?  When I was a child, I didn't understand it.  Now, as an adult, I do.  The mission was accomplished, and it was time to move on.  As one of the main characters said, all was as it should be.So is this movie.  Enjoy it with your own daughter. . .",N/A

Denise Richards is awful as Christmas Jones. She might be pretty but she sure can't act. The line where she says, &quot;Or are you just hoping for a glimmer?&quot; makes me wince each time.3.

666573,"""Replicant"" offers a twist, on the standard cop chasing a killer story, attempting to use insight provided by the murderer's genetic clone, to track down the killer.  Jean-Claude Van Damme has dual roles as the serial killer, and also as his clone, ""Replicant"".  Michael Rooker is the ex-cop who comes out of ""retirement"" to attempt to train Replicant, and see if he can lead him to the killer.Traumatized as a child by his mother, Luc Sevard has become a serial murderer.  His victims are single mothers.  Nicknamed ""The Torch"", because he sets the dead bodies on fire, he has eluded the efforts of the Seattle police, headed by Detective Jake Riley (Rooker) for three years.  On Riley's last day on the force, the Torch claims his eleventh victim.No longer on the force, Riley is recruited by the National Security Force (NSF) to participate in a top-secret operation.  NSF has cloned Sevard's DNA and created Replicant (his name).  The plan is to train Replicant and then attempt to tap into his memory and somehow get a lead to the killer.  Riley takes charge of Replicant and begins his training, treating him like an animal, trying to trigger his memory.The dual roles play to Van Damme's strengths as an actor.  Replicant is childlike, has limited dialog, and communicates more by actions rather than words.  Sevard is also more of a man of action, with most of his interaction with others consisting of fights or attacks.  The fight scenes between the longhaired Sevard, and the close cropped clone, required extensive doubling, and are done pretty well.Riley is actually the movie's lead character, and is important as the focal point between the Yin and Yang of the Van Damme characters.  Put in a tough spot, he isn't sure how to handle Replicant, and so he must err on the side of caution, and treat him with a great deal of distrust.  Michael Rooker really throws himself into the physically challenging role.Replicant is a decent action movie.  Jean-Claude is not required to go beyond his limits, and does a good job with the material.  The aging action hero still has some good moves left, and believe it or not, his acting skills have improved some too.  If you are a Van Damme or Rooker fan, check this one out.",N/A
436547,"This movie is known as ""Zombie flesheaters"" in the UK, and trying to obtain a decent copy of it has been a big problem for years for us Brits. It was banned altogether as a ""video nasty"" during the 1980s and the version that was finally reissued on video about ten years ago was ruined by excessive censorship. Even the ""extreme"" re-release which is now available still suffers from a couple of very brief cuts, which seems particularly pointless in this day and age when it's so easy to buy the full version online.The film stars Ian McCulloch (from the mid-70s cult TV series ""Survivors"") and Tisa Farrow (Mia's less talented sister) and begins as an apparently deserted boat is spotted drifting through Hudson Bay. A harbour patrol boat draws up alongside and two cops climb aboard to investigate. One makes the mistake of going down into the cabin to look around, and very soon the score is already Zombies 1 Humans 0....The boat belongs to a famous scientist who set sail for the Antilles three months earlier but has since disappeared. His daughter Ann (Farrow) and journalist Peter West (McCulloch) decide to go and look for him, after reading a letter he sent from the island of Matul, in which he talks about contracting a mysterious disease.They fly to the Caribbean, hire a boat and are soon on their way to Matul, where they meet Dr David Menard who has been carrying out experiments on the disease, not believing local superstitions that it's caused by voodoo. Although the visitors are sceptical when he claims that it turns its victims into the ""undead"", before long we see compelling evidence that he might be correct....Most classic gore movies have a particular moment that everybody remembers and in this case it's the notorious ""eye-gouging"" scene, but there's plenty more excellent gore on offer, as well as an amusing interlude involving a shark (possibly included because the movie was being made while the whole world was still in the grip of ""Jaws"" fever) and a very corny ending. The acting and dialogue aren't great by normal standards but well above average for a film of this type, and although the pace of the film is initially a little too slow, once our main protagonists arrive on the island it picks up very quickly. And considering the low budget Fulci had at his disposal the special effects are pretty good too.A lot of people find the soundtrack music annoying and it's certainly a little too loud at times. Featuring extensive use of the noise-generating capabilities of some primitive analog synth, the film's more dramatic moments tend to be accompanied by a crescendo of electronic belching noises, and there's also a rather tedious refrain which you have to endure over and over again. On the plus side, there's plenty of ""voodoo"" drumming which, when used in combination with the aforementioned synth sometimes manages to sound like primordial techno....""Zombie flesheaters"" is as good as it gets from Fulci, and IMHO is the only serious rival to George Romero's ""Dawn of the dead"" for the title of best zombie flick of all time. If you enjoy this film I'd also recommend Fulci's ""The beyond"" and ""House by the cemetery"".",Zombie VHS

The first one is the 25th ANNIVERSARY Copy which boasts a digitally remastered print.  The film was never shot in widescreen so you get it in full screen. The 25th Anniversary only contains mono soundtrack, but features wise, includes two interviews with John Saxton, and a theatrical trailer.The second DVD available is the SPECIAL EDITION which came out in late 2002.  The picture quality has been further improved on the 25th Anniversary copy, but is only a marginal difference.  However, they have tried to make it look widescreen by chopping the top and bottom off of the original film and putting black bars. This gives the impression of widescreen, but as mentioned above, the film was originally shot full screen.  The Special Edition boasts a documentary, more interviews, a theatrical trailer, better sound ... and much more.So which copy to get?  If you are a die-hard fan of the film, it's wise to get the 25th ANNIVERSARY copy because you get the full uncropped image of the film.  Sure, all the extras features on the new SPECIAL EDITION are a  bonus, but you can probably live without them.  Like most DVD extras, they often only get looked at once or twice ....",N/A

There were some great performances (especially by Louis Gossett Jr. as Fiddler), but there were a few I could have done without, like Sandy Duncan and whoever played that poor white guy starting with episode five. They featured too many unbelievable coincidences, which means lazy writing to me. The show also looked claustrophobic after episode one , no doubt because of budget constraints.

122574,"""Keep your lovin' brother happy.""By the time we reach the end of Once Upon a Time in the West, hear Henry Fonda utter these intensely powerful words, and discover the meaning behind a long-awaited revenge, we have been taken on a long, leisurely carriage ride through Western folklore.Who would have guessed that an Italian would make the best cinema of the American West? But Sergio Leone was that man. With his ""Man with No Name"" trilogy (A Fistful of Dollars, For a Few Dollars More, and The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly), he made a star of Clint Eastwood and presented a vision that none had seen before and that has yet to be matched.And then he topped himself. Once Upon a Time in the West is undoubtedly the finest Western ever made, in a genre filled with classics. All the Leone trademarks are here: the beautiful expansive landscapes, the extreme closeups, the nameless hero (strikingly underplayed by Charles Bronson), and the operatic score by Ennio Morricone (with separate motifs for each character). But somehow they all come together as if for the first time, as if all that came before was simply rehearsal.From an original story by the Italian triple-threat of Leone, Dario Argento (Suspiria), and Bernardo Bertolucci (Last Tango in Paris), Leone and Sergio Donati fashioned a screenplay that typifies and then transcends the genre.But the plot is less important than the style. Leone's love for the West is apparent in how he lets the scenes flow at their own speed, never hurrying, never forcing them to a conclusion. The languid pacing makes for a much longer film (it clocks in at three hours), but also one much more emotionally real. It gives us time to really experience what we're seeing: a film about the West made by one of its biggest fans.",N/A

380416,"This could also be considered a black sheep of the series primaily becasue of how small of a role Jason really plays (physically).  To some weird extent in this one his heart is a parasite that can jump from body to body when the origional carcass is destroyed (in this case blown to hell).  He then continues to kill but in variose bodies.  It is up to his neice to slay him (because his sister dies) but with the problem that if Jason goes inside her aka through the vagina, he will be reborn and continue to kill.  Actually one way or another he would kill but it would not require him to leap from corpse to corpse.  There is a bounty hunter after him as well and in the end he is defeated in a special effects style kill (a bunch of hands from the earth grab him and drag him down) and it sets up for Freddy vs Jason set to be released sometime in 2003/2004 time range.  Overall this movie is decent but not the best of the series.",N/A
140001,"Sixteen years on, it's curious to look back at the cultural firestorm sparked by David Lynch's ""Blue Velvet."" While this seminal work of American surrealism hasn't lost its ability to disorient and unsettle, it is nonetheless a film that wouldn't seem too out of place these days as an HBO original. Lynch oversaw a new transfer of ""Blue Velvet"" for this MGM special-edition DVD. Butchered by pan-and-scan in most of its video incarnations, the film is presented in dramatic anamorphic widescreen. Lynch's artistic images are markedly enhanced by their journey through the digital domain. Some of the upgrades are on display right away: the title images of blue velvet and the color-saturated opening shot of roses against a white fence. These visuals are tough to top, but overall the movie looks great and sounds OK. The lengthy ""Mysteries of Love"" documentary, by making-of specialist Jeffrey Schwarz, interviews the stars and key crew members. The creator of ""Eraserhead,"" and ""Mulholland Drive"" is actually a ""boy scout,"" they say, who uses expressions like ""peachy keen"" and takes meetings over shakes at Bob's Big Boy. But then there are those weekend photo projects with dead chickens. ... Those interviews are current, but Lynch isn't talking so the docu utilizes grainy 1987 footage of him talking with reporters but no new shots of the press-shy director. Lynch's low-light segments look like clips from a dated crime docu, giving the enterprise a dash of oddness that he probably appreciates. A must for fans of this peculiar film, including those who own the earlier widescreen DVD.",N/A

There is also a man that learns that rasism is wrong and grows up.",N/A
705945,"I found We Were Soldiers to be entertaining, but I found it falling far short of my expectations. Saving Private Ryan (which I consider to be a masterpiece on film) has raised the limbo pole, if you will, of what combat should look like on film. I did not see the look of horror I expected on every soldier's face when the Vietnamese soldiers were firing AK-47 rounds only inches from their faces.Over and over again the film reminded me of the old John Wayne movies, where the heroes shoot up the bad guys while only the extras are killed or wounded on their team. The Vietnames soldiers were about twelve feet away, yet they scored zero hits on US soldiers in fight after fight. Also, the enemy had zero artillery. Not even so much as a mortar round landed on the American positions. I'm pretty sure that at least some form of artillery would be standard issue for any North Vietnamese division (or any division in the world, for that matter). As cramped as the US solders were in their position, a single mortar crew could have killed them all.Despite this, the film is decent enough for a single viewing. I was glad that I went to the early show.",N/A
151477,"""I remember that hot wonderful summer, when the teenage miracle reached full bloom, and everyone in England stopped what they were doing to stare at what had happened.""--opening narrationI also remember the number of times I tuned into MTV for David Bowie's video, which included clips from that movie.  I finally saw it on TV and I was blown away.Colin is the main character and narrator of this story.  It's the long hot summer of 1958.  Rationing was over, and Britain was rebuilt, thanks to the Marshall Plan--now it was time for Britain to have fun with their own pop culture explosion.  Colin has a lot of colourful friends.  There's Wizard, pickpocket and entrepreneur out for a fast pound, Cool, the African trumpet player, the flamboyant Fabulous Hotlife, described as ""our own Oscar Wilde,"" Dean Swift, ""a modern jazz creation,"" and Big Jill, a hefty but friendly lesbian.  And yes, there's the luscious Suzette, Colin's love interest, whose wanting to make it to the fashion big-time causes a rift between them.Suzette does make it big, attracting the attention of her boss, Henley of Mayfair (James Fox).  She comes onstage in a daring glittering black mini, and does the hot jazz number ""Va Va Voom"" with some African dancers.Colin spends time taking snaps at the neon glitter and sights of the London nightlife, but doesn't want to go mainstream.  ""It's not that I've got anything against money.  It's just what you have to do to get it.""  He eventually does pictures for Harry Charms (Lionel Blair), an oily talent searcher and agent with a penchant for young boys.  It's actually gratifying when his protege Baby Boom shoves a microphone full force in his happy sacks.  And I don't know if anyone noticed, but early in the movie, BB's the schoolboy who ends up picking up Charms' card that Colin throws away.  It took me a while to finally realize.Kinks frontman Ray Davies plays Colin's father, a man who lives with his ""pre-war photo albums and sad memories.""  Colin's half-brother Vern is a disgusting, barely human cretin.  And his mother (Mandy Rice-Davies of Christine Keeler fame), disillusioned with life, has affairs with the numerous lodgers.  The cutaway tenement for the ""Quiet Life"" number is a brilliant touch, as is the chaos going on in there.David Bowie has only a small role as Vendice Partners, that seller of dreams, but his musical number ""That's Motivation,"" where he successfully tempts Colin into selling out has a wowser of a set including giant typewriters, a globes with an airplane attached at the equator, an Everest mockup marketing frozen vegetables, and a floor painted to look like a giant 78 record.Speaking of musicians, Sade doesn't look out of place singing ""Killer Blow.""  She's simply exquisite!Patsy Kensit is so much more ravishing here than she ever was before she went on to Lethal Weapon 2 and Angels And Insects.  Eve Ferrett is wonderful as the bubbly Big Jill.Notable cameos include Steven Berkoff (Clockwork Orange, Beverly Hills Cop) as a Neo-Nazi fanatic presumably modelled after Enoch Powell, Colin Jeavons (House of Cards) as the fanatic's pamphleteer, Julian Firth (Brother Jerome in the Cadfael series) is the Misery Kid, dressed in the skeleton suit, and Robbie Coltrane (Krull, Harry Potter) as Mario the store owner.The hot swing jazz sets the pace of the movie, replicating a slice of England sadly long gone.  A real blast of a movie.",Absolute Beginners VHS

But as the nanny falls in love with a man working at the house, the girl gets angry. The girl has control of zombies from the nearby cemetary, and she uses them to strike back at everyone around her.This disk is very good, as well. It contains trailers for many other movies, and it has a ""short"" movie (which is about 70 minutes, I believe), that also has zombies in it (that movie is older, and there is very little gore, since the zombies are basically used as cheap workers, as in most older zombie movies).Excluding several scenes, this one is not as graphic as most zombie movies, but still is gory enough that some people may want to avoid it.",N/A
683321,"After over 5 years after its last episode the Internationally acclaimed, award-winning British sitcom returned in late 2001 with its fourth season. Times had changed and quite clearly so had the programme. In an effort to keep with the ever-changing times and contemporary trends, Jennifer Saunders seems to have slightly adapted a more diverse approach to her writing. Though the fast, witty dialogue consistently flows, there are flaws in some of these episodes albeit only minors ones but don't capture the pace and magic of the origanal 3 seasons. Still there are more things to recommend it and fans of the series will surley be satisfied. Edina (Jennifer Saunders) and Joanna Lumley are as vile as ever, though Edina's self-obsessed dieting plan seems a little out of character and even as though ideas were wearing a little thin. But the cast carry this off with finesse regardless and both Jennifer Saunders and Joanna Lumleys timing is stil impeccable though the punchlines don't come quite as thick and fast as they once did. The first episode of the series, Paralox seems a little lost and not quite sure of which direction its trying to head but things pick up from here on with Fish farm where Edina hires a gardener who she thinks is a rich aristocrat and so sets about seducing him. There is a hark back to the good old days of the origanal series with some masterful comic playing by Saunders and Lumley whilst Paris is where Patsy gets involved in a magazine photoshoot and Edina and Saffy (Joanna Sawalha) begin actually bonding as mother and daughter (until the amusing climax). Donkey sees Edina frantically trying to take a detox and this is perharps one of the weaker episodes in this season whilst Small Opening sees saffy take her play about Edinas life onto the stage. The last episode is consistently amusing where Patsy and Eddy join Menopausals anonymous. The ending is another look into the future of Eddy and Patsy where they are hilariously seen as old women whihis distinctley reminiscent to the last episode of the third season in 1995. Still it remains amusing as does this series on the whole even though not eclipsing the first three seasons. Jane Horrocks turns up playing a pretentious daytime television presenter and June Whitfield as Edina's batty mother who is even more dizzier this time. Also included on this DVD is the television special, Mirror Ball starring the same cast and distinctley has the feel of an Absolutly Fabulous episode. A well comprised DVD with some interesting extra features included as the bonus. Highly recommended and a classic comic gem!",Absolutely Fabulous: Complete Series 4
576402,"I've always had a soft spot in my heart for Slayers. This series is just so endearing that you instantly fall in love with the characters which helps cover any problems with the plot. Series one was kind of a disappointment to me in places (although it was still brilliant in others) while Slayers Next (season two) was sheer bliss and represented what was to me the pinnacle of Slayers; great character interaction, sharp dialogue and an excellent plot.Slayers Try is the third season of Slayers and although it's a lot different then Slayers Next, it is still brilliant and in some ways is superior to the series that preceded it.The humor isn't nearly as present here as it was before, and Slayers Try takes on a much darker tone then the previous outings. Sure the humor is still here but it isn't as in your face, which is both a strength and a weakness. Clearly it was a gamble to change the focus of the series but I think the creators made a good decision when they realized they couldn't possibly make a repeat of Next while maintaining any form of originality.Try introduces a few new characters, some of which are memorable, some of which are not. I really like Valgaav as well as Jillas on the bad guy side; especially since they were given a fully fleshed out history and the motivations for their behavior made a lot of sense. Also of note is Fillia who makes an excellent foil for Xellos, although she often ends up just being humiliated instead of getting the better of him.Nothing much has changed for the core characters; the romance angle has been dropped somewhat (which is a little disappointing since it's obvious that the series creators injected a lot of chemistry between the couples up till now) but we still have the occasional bit thrown in for good measure.It is hard to describe much else without ruining the plot of Slayers Try, but suffice to say that it reminded me a lot of Lodoss War with the characters of Slayers thrown in. A lot more serious, but it is a credit to the characters that they are flexible enough for us to take them seriously during times of tension and laugh at them during times of craziness. Great work, although some die hard Slayers fans might be turned off by the de-emphasis on humor.",N/A
584890,"I went into Spiderman with high expectations for a movie on one of my 2 favorite super heros, directed by one of my favorite directors. I can happily say that I was not let down. This movie blew my expectations away. Toby Maguire is a perfect adolescent Peter Parker; Kirsten Dunst is beautiful, and does a pretty good job playing Mary Jane Watson; and Willem Dafoe is outstanding as the Green Goblin. Casting was outstanding. The costumes, unlike those of the X-Men, look like they were torn straight from the comic-book pages. Everything is presented in Sam Rami's (Evil Dead trilogy, Darkman, and Xena television series) wonderfully campy style without going overboard and becoming stupid slapstick mush. Also, fans of the Evil Dead trilogy should be pleased to know that Rami has lots of Evil Dead cameos in Spiderman, Ash's car makes an appearance, as does Bruce CampbellPersonally,I feel Spiderman rises above my other favorite superhero movie: Tim Burton's 1989 Batman. Star Wars Episode II definitely has its work cut out for it, and I don't think there is much chance that the modernized Star Wars will be able to one-up the Wall-crawler.

603468,"Todd Haynes' new film is a homage to 1950s Hollywood, specifically the glossy Technicolor dramas of Douglas Sirk, ""women's pictures"" featuring stars such as Jane Wyman and Lana Turner as glamorously coiffed and dressed women beset by adversity. From the fonts chosen for the opening title sequence, to the music by veteran film composer Elmer Bernstein, to every detail of the set decoration and costuming, the period is evoked to perfection, not so much the actual time period as how it was portrayed on film.It is thus easy early on to regard the movie as a campy sendup, with its stilted dialogue and portrayal of an impossibly perfect family, social and business life. As ""Far From Heaven"" progresses, however, it is apparent that Haynes has a much more grandiose aim. His genius and unique power is his ability to continue evoking the film conventions of Sirk and 50s Hollywood even as he subverts them. Cathy Whitaker (Julianne Moore), faced with the knowledge that her husband (Dennis Quaid) is straying, turns to the handsome gardener (Dennis Haysbert) for solace, just as Jane Wyman turned to Rock Hudson in Sirk's ""All That Heaven Allows."" (Note the titular reference.) Only this time the handsome, intelligent, soft-spoken gardener is black. Moreover, she catches her husband in the arms not of another woman but a man. Suddenly Moore's impeccably styled and coiffed heroine is dealing with homosexuality and the possibility of interracial romance, issues that tear her carefully managed existence to shreds by the end, with no artificial happy ending this time to restore order.Haynes' vision could not have been realized without the assistance of his leading actors, all of whom give performances that brilliantly walk the fine line between sincerity and irony. Julianne Moore's Cathy and Dennis Quaid's Frank are fine enough, but Dennis Haysbert arguably has the most difficult task--to make the impossibly noble and intelligent gardener a believable human figure. (A scene where Cathy and her gardener converse about Miro at a posh art opening that he has somehow managed to wander into strikes, for me, the only false note in the script.) It is a measure of his success that the scenes between him and Moore, while they occasionally may be implausible as drama, are always believable as two wounded souls reaching out to one another. Due to the depth and power of the emotions projected by the actors, ""Far From Heaven"" transcends its origins as a retro-homage and attains the power of the finest human drama. It's the best film I've seen in a long time.",N/A

314333,"You're making a mistake if you compare this film with the Eon Bonds of the Sixties.  You're also making a mistake if you compare it with later spy spoofs, like AUSTIN POWERS.  In fact, it would be a mistake to compare this film to anything.  Approached on its own merits, CASINO ROYALE is an oddball maze of plots, characters, pop-art images, and over-the-top gags that brims with a great sense of life and giddy humor.  Does everything make sense?  No.  Is it something of a jumble?  Yes.  Are all of the gags funny?  I don't think so.  But do any of those things get in the way of this being a thoroughly entertaining romp for anyone with half a sense of humor?  Not at all.  CASINO ROYALE is one of my all-time favorite pick-me-up movies when I'm stuck with the flu at home, and it's a great pleasure to share with friends, especially if you have a soft spot for Sixties culture.  It is silliness for the sake of silliness, designed purely to delight and distract, and, to paraphrase William Saroyan, I can think of few things more noble.I've been looking forward to the DVD release for some time, and have been a little dismayed at the scant information about it from various sites.  Now that I have it, I can say that MGM has treated the film well.  Is it a red-carpet treatment like the Eon Bonds have gotten?  No.  But it is a far better DVD package than we were given with NEVER SAY NEVER AGAIN.  The image and color quality have a vibrance fitting a film of the era (and I mean that in a good way), and the sound -- including one of cinema's most distinctive scores, written by Burt Bacharach -- is presented in a newly digitally enhanced 5.1.The extras are what interested me, and (especially for the price) the disc provides some goodies.  One is the original TV version of CASINO ROYALE, shot with Barry Nelson as an Americanized ""Jimmy Bond.""  The other is a NEW making-of featurette with Val Guest discussing the film.  Guest was one of the five directors (!) on the movie, and was charged with trying to tie it all together.  He has some really great behind-the-scenes info, mostly told under footage from the movie.  The featurette is not the best I've seen, but it's hardly the worst, and sheds great light on how this distinctive and idiosyncratic one-of-a-kind picture was made.  I wish they had asked Guest to do a commentary, but I'm not griping.  Considering how little has been written on the making of this genuinely twisted film, the featurette alone is more than welcomed.  There is an original trailer included, and the film is presented letterboxed.For the price, CASINO ROYALE can't be beat.  Its influence on the POWERS series will be obvious to even the most casual viewer, right down to the music.",Casino Royale
689351,"I bought this movie ""blind"" because it was the ""lost"" View Askew film.  While Kevin Smith is kind of uneven as a director (Clerks, Amy, and Jay and Silent Bob were great, Mallrats was acceptable, and Dogma was juvenile but funny), this is a project he helped fund.  Starring Jason Lee and Jason Mewes (Jay) of View Askew fame, plus a lot of other Askewnies including Smith himself, this film details the lives of a clutch of welfare bums in Vancouver.  When their welfare is cut off, they have to come up with a new plan.One night, while watching a nature documentary, Jason Lee gets the bright idea to go look for Bigfoot.  Except, he doesn't want to tell his friends, because they might think he's a psychopath.  So he tricks them into going camping with him, in an effort to drive the group deeper and deeper into the woods.  Things start to unravel from there as the group fights about drugs, sex, and food (in that order, I might add).There's a lot of problems with this movie.  Shot in dirty black-and-white, it's very hard on the eyes, and it seems like no effort was made to clean it up for DVD.  The acting is only passable (it seems like everyone knows they aren't getting paid for this, and they are trying to wrap ASAP).  The plot, while promising, doesn't pan out.  The pithy dialogue that is View Askew's trademark is absent, and the potential for a Blair Witch-style horror film is wasted on recycled bong jokes and stoner `philosophy.'The DVD presentation is decent: sound isn't any better than two-channel stereo, but it doesn't really have to be.  There are some deleted scenes (and you can use seamless branching to put them back in the movie - congrats for that, at least!)  The commentary is funny, much moreso than the movie itself, as the cast and crew sit around trashing it and talking about how awful it is.I wouldn't even recommend this to a Kevin Smith fan, without renting it first.

358955,"Jim Henson actually resented the Muppets' success much of the time, as it kept him from being taken seriously by many members of his industry, as well as the public.  He channeled much of this resentment into &quot;The Dark Crystal,&quot; which is often too dark for many of the children it was marketed towards.  As a child, however, I was never frightened by the film.  I was awed, mesmerized by it.  Although not wholly succesful in some aesthetic terms (the mouth movements of the Gelflings can be annoyingly badly synced to the actual dialogue), it is a truly beautiful film.  Almost 20 years down the line, and the ending still makes me a little teary.  OK, so I'm a big sap.  But as much as I love the Muppets, and I do, I regret that Jim Henson didn't have more opportunities to stretch his wings into more science fictiony, older audience things like this.

I couldn't have been more wrong.""Phantom Menace"" made me think they might be pretty good after all, but it was ""Attack of the Clones"" that convinced me. Brimming over with intrigue, action, and an all-too-human love story, the second film in the Star Wars Saga is the best one yet.Two independent plot threads weave through the film's narrative, colliding in a massive battle-royal at the picture's end. Each storyline is satisfying in its own right - whether you're watching Obi-Wan Kenobi investigate the mysterious clones, or Anakin Skywalker coming to grips with his past and present, you get a full movie within a movie!Plus, ""Attack of the Clones"" refreshes our affection for characters from the other films in the series. See-Threepio is at his best, providing uproariously funny slapstick. Jango Fett (as a substitute for his son, Boba) provides the thrill of a mysterious, competent soldier-of-fortune, and contributes to some of the coolest action sequences in the whole Saga.But the best surprise is how Yoda deals with the nefarious Count Dooku!Character relationships are fleshed out, and ominous hints to the identity of the evil mastermind Darth Sidious make it almost impossible to wait for Episode !

It is like watching the series for the first time.  The DVD version has been restored and enhanced so that Brideshead is indeed, in Charles' words, &quot;very near to heaven&quot;.  Not only is the series visually more beautiful than ever, the audio is also superb.  You won't miss a single word.  Brideshead Revisited is a story of lost youth, fading illusions, and crumbling glory, but it is also an evocation of growing religious faith and the workings of divine grace.  No matter how many times it is watched it is always an uplifting experience.  And now the DVD version has made that experience incomparably more rewarding.",N/A

The farmers's house of course has a basement, and the living quarters are decorated like a funeral parlor and there is an awful lot of talking and no action.OK for home entertainment where the fridge is close by and a nice broken-in sofa.Thoroughly disappointing, waste of gas money, waste of ticket money, and a thorough waste of time.",Signs
133520,"Kansas represents our dreary lives & we, kids & adults alike, often wish for something else, thinking that it would enhance our lives, even for a bit second --- even if it was just a dream.  We hope & dream that somewhere over the rainbow there is a place like Oz.  But wait, is Oz that perfect?  Yes, it seems  better off with its yellow brick road, with munchkins roaming around in their colorful outfits, the Emerald Palace, but are the inhabitants happy & safe there as you would have thought?  No, there is evil & fear of the wicked witch, deception by the wizard himself & his taking advantage of his blind followers.  But most of all, there is still this disatisfaction as you know, by the brainless scarecrow, heartless tin man & cowardly lion, who could have represented anybody in that kingdom -- real or imagined.Despite this seemingly adult plot, the film appeals to children as well, basically because of its fairy-tale type manner of presentation -- all these splendid architecture, colorful costumes, vibrant songs, & of course, a fairy tale will not be complete without the presence of the evil villainess - the witch!Taking all these in consideration, the film is just as timeless as it relays a very special message.  You don't have to look far to seek happiness or satisfaction, for you can find it in yourself.  We might be just like the scarecrow, the tin man or the lion, continuously searching for what they already have deep inside.  & yes, most of the time, we are like Dorothy, always wishing to escape reality but only realizing at the end that true happiness is being with your loved ones, through thick or thin.",N/A
595309,"In the first half of the 20th century, O'Henry was one of the most famous writers of his time, famous for his twist endings. He wrote the oft reworked story, The Gift, about a young, poor wife who sells her beautiful long hair she's loved since childhood, to buy a chain for the pocket watch her husband loves. Her husband sells his watch to buy a beautiful comb for her hair.M. Night Shyamalan may be this century's O'Henry, telling stories with wonderful twists-- twists with otherworldly elements.I was surprised and a bit disappointed, before seeing Signs, since the reviews I encountered gave marginal ratings. But I enjoyed both of Shyamalan's other flicks, so I saw the movie the first chance I got. The theater, the biggest in a a mega movie house of 24 theaters, was totally filled.And I was not disappointed. This movie keeps you on the edge of your seat 98% of the time. It follows all the rules for good story creation and I got what I want in a movie-- a good emotional experience, with a chill, a shiver or a heartwarming good feeling. I left the movie very satisfied.The story: it's about crop circles which appear on Mel Gibson's farm in Buck's County. He doesn't believe, but his kids and brother do. As the film goes into the second act and the story intensifies, Gibson struggles with his demons. We meet the aliens, and Shyamalan delivers a nicely woven, layered, twist ending which pulls all the pieces together.Bottom line, this movie delivered.",Signs
321770,"George S. Kauffman &amp; Moss Hart's GEORGE WASHINGTON SLEPT HERE was one of Broadway's most successfull comedies of the early 1940s, a bright and witty tale with a slightly Americana tone that World War II audiences found particularly appealing.  The film version, sparked up by the completely unexpected chemistry of dry-humored Jack Benny and &quot;Oomph Girl&quot; Ann Sheridan, is every bit as charming.When New Yorkers Bill and Connie Fuller (Benny and Sheridan) are evicted from their apartment (their third change of address in less than a year), wife Connie decides what they need is a place in the country... and buys an incredibly dilapidated house where George Washington is said to have once slept.  Needless to say, husband Bill is horrified--and keeps on being horrified as the price of renovation skyrockets.  Benny was most popular when he played himself in roles tailored to his talents, but although this role is atypical his talents are well suited to the constantly harried Bill Fuller--and he has remarkable rapport with co-star Ann Sheridan, an underestimated actress who shows tremendous flair for comedy as his determinedly optimistic wife.  Both are well supported by a cast that includes Charles Coburn, Joyce Reynolds, and Percy Kilbride, and Hattie McDaniel (best remembered as Mammy in GONE WITH THE WIND) really shines as Hester, their long-suffering domestic who finds herself with a hole in the kitchen wall big enough for a horse to walk through--and one does!  The pace is snappy, the script is witty, and every one is sure to have a good time.  Recommended.",N/A
213583,"&quot;Lady Jane&quot; was a very beautiful movie but it was not accurate.  The person who play Jane Grey seem too cold and even rude sometime but in reality Jane was a sweet girl, not cold and rude.  Also Jane didn't love Guildford Dudley, they never had a love romance like in the movie at all.  This movie is mostly base on the beautiful love story between Jane and Guildford but that love story never existe is not accurate.I think the one who play Queen Mary was good and seem to have more character then the one in the more modern movie &quot;Elizabeth&quot; with Cate Blanchett.  Mary in the movie &quot;Lady Jane&quot; is not boring and plain like the one in the movie &quot;Elizabeth&quot;.It's still is a beautiful and good movie.

683576,"When Strangers Appear, is the kind of movie that can suck you in, and take you along for a suspenseful, and unpredictable journey.  Written and directed by Scott Reynolds, the film is an Australian production, set in of all places, Oregon.  The plot unfolds, taking twists and turns, designed to keep you guessing.  The film features no big stars, but contains solid performances by the entire cast.  Ultimately how much you may enjoy it, may depend on your tolerance for ambiguity.  If you need to have total clarity and resolution, you may not be satisfied with the ending.  Saying too much, about exactly what happens, would ruin it for those who have not yet seen the movie, but here are some peripheral comments.Radha Mitchell, is an actress with talent.  She was great in ...Pitch Black..., and also plays a strong woman here.  Her performance is believable, and rings true throughout.  No cheap laughs, or throwaway lines.  Her character ""Beth"", is busy running two businesses.  By day, a tiny dinner, and at night, she manages a motel.  Barry Watson, gives an edgy performance as a furtive and suspicious drifter who shows up at the diner, claiming that people are after him.  Josh Lucas plays a helpful ""surfer"", one who's concerned about Beth.  And Kevin Anderson plays the local lawman, a guy who apparently has problems controlling himself around women, especially Beth.When Strangers Appear, is an interesting film, with some quirky choices in editing.  It starts a bit slow, but the level of violence escalates, at times quite surprisingly.  The plot twists keep you guessing, and in the end, you don't know exactly what it was all for.  There are some major problems with time sequencing during a standoff scene at the diner, where it goes from noon to dusk in just a few minutes.  Also, cars seem to suddenly and silently, appear out of nowhere, a bit too often.  The foreign locales could pass for Oregon, unless perhaps you're an expert on trees of the Pacific Northwest.  A couple of minor characters, do seem to have a hint of Aussie type accents.  The post end credit ""post script"" doesn't add anything.  Though far from perfect, it is still a thriller well worth your time.  Radha Mitchell continues to show that she is an actress with much potential.The DVD contains both widescreen and full screen versions of the movie.  The extras are minimal, and the subtitling is not true to the actual dialog.",When Strangers Appear
585859,"I'm a 7th grader, and my class watched this film at school because we had to do a gruelingly hard art project on it...but that's not the point. I agreed with the idea of watching it, basically so we could watch TV instead of studying. I liked Ice Age and Shrek, but this didn't really appeal to me at all. But after watching it, I really liked it. The movie's based towards young kids (obviously), but it would definetly appeal to older kids and even adults.It's just like a big cartoon; very entertaining, even if you don't crack up laughing. It's about Mike and Sully (why is it always so easy to remember character's names in kid's movies?), two monsters, living in their alternate monster world. What are their jobs? Scaring childen. Every child has their own monster, and the monster's job is to scare them every now and then by coming out their closet and doing what monsters do. Well, what humans don't know is that monsters are just as scared of them as they are of them. Monsters fear humans, believing they're intoxicated, poisoned, etc., so when a human baby slips into the Monsters Inc. factory, Sully and Mike hide it the best they can, but, like all things you try to hide, it slips out, and panic covers Monstropolis. It all turns out to be a fun-filled family comedy/cartoon, that everyone will enjoy. Myself? I enjoyed it more than Shrek.",N/A
86844,"Stephen King's THE SHINING, is one of the less suspenseful and less action-packed novels compared to most of his others.  Unfortunately, -as with most of King's flics, which are, generally-speaking, one-star debacles- the movie, ""The Shining"" isn't even half as good as the mediocre novel was.The Shining is flawed in about every conceivable way: With the exception of Jack Nicholson, the remaining actors are far more insipid and less interesting and solid as the book would have you imagine them being.  The movie omits some of the novel's best moments, and when the movie DOESN'T omit suspenseful moments from the book, it either shows it in a very cheesy, unsuspenseful manner and/or doesn't follow the book accurately.  (E.g., Jack Nicholson was supposed to be using a mallet to injure people, not an axe; the black man arrived at the hotel by way of a snowplow with a roof, but in the book it was a snowmobile, etc.)  All in all, The Shining ends up being the most boring, suspenseless, and one of the cheesiest Stephen King flics I've ever seen.The movie may be worth purchasing if you are an extremely die-hard King connoisseur, but if not then don't even consider this disastrous film.",N/A

478485,"There's an unwritten rule that all movie fans know: If you see the name Shannon Tweed in a movie's credits (she also co-produced this one) the movie will be garbage. Sure, you're guaranteed there'll be scenes of gratuitous nudity, but the movie itself will stink worse than Mickey Rourke after an all night bender.THE ROWDY GIRLS is basically Troma's attempt to make a soft porn western, as the video slick says ""Careful not to shoot your load!"" Clever.The plot: A prostitute and an unhappy bride (both Playmates) liberate themselves in the Wild West 1886; but are taken captive by another liberated, big breasted woman (Playmate) and her posse. After that not a lot happens, except this awful country-western balladeer keeps popping up for no discernable reason. ROWDY GIRLS also features the daftest clmactic shootout your'e ever likely to see.Obviously this is not one of Troma's best, but they have made far worse (like FEMME FONTAINE and DEMENTED DEATH FARM MASSACRE which I also recommend for guys who like big breasts). I just hope (again) there's no sequel in the works. Actually Shannon Tweed's acting is OK in this, which is a big surprise. Still it could have been worse. It could have starred Ron Jeremy and Divine.",N/A
703785,"Yes, when I buy each set of the Sopranos, in the viewing nights ahead it becomes my reason for being. Nothing interferes with my seeing my newly purchased set.  It was true for sets one and two and now three. The first episode is a bit weak as it involves federal agents wiring Tony's house but after that the series takes off with a roar. There is so much good stuff going on that is would take a journal to catalogue them all.  However, here are some of the highlights. Tony's mother's funeral is an incredible study of how death can sanctify even the most vile of people.  However, the wake becomes a festering point where only so much hypocrisy can survive before exploding. Carmella seeks separate psychiatric help and that is my favorite scene in the whole series.  Her psychiatrist is the one and only person to turn down Soprano money in the series, saying that the reason he won't accept payment is that it is blood money. He says that she has to hear and understand that she is living on blood money and that is the root of her problems. Now she will not be able to say she never heard that truth.  The daughter Meadow becomes involved with a young man also connected to the Soprano crime family but only on the farthest reaches of it.  His stepfather, however, is key to Tony's entire organization.  Tony's sister Janet steals her late mother's caregiver's artificial leg to get some LP records back from her. Janet essentially is coming to replace the mother in the series but she engrafts a West Coast flakiness onto the inner rotten core, a very unusual combination of character traits but it works.  Once again, the Sopranos manages to capture the women in this setting better than any previous crime family saga. These women are not doormats.  There is a lot going on in each and every one of them and I find them even more fascinating than the men in the series.  Tony's psychiatrist is back too with trauma of her own to handle and she is tempted to let Tony handle her problem for her in his usual violent manner.  If you can resist this series, you are a stronger person than I.  I positively wallow in it.",N/A

Daughter Charisse (Raven-Symone) has developed an attitude about sharing her birthday with her family and also seems to be troubled by something, but won't tell her parents what it is.  While the dinner/party goes on, Dr. Dolittle is summoned first by a opossum then by a raccoon, to go see The Beaver (the animal kingdom's equivalent of the Mafia).  The doc, raccoon and opossum go to see The Beaver in the country and doc learns that the animals are upset because the humans are cutting down their home.  A bad guy named Joseph Potter is cutting down all the woods because there is money to be made in the process.  Doc's wife is a lawyer who says that one way to stop Potter is to prove there is an endangered species living in the wooded area.  Enter Archie, a circus bear raised by humans, and Ava, a wild bear living in the woods.  Archie and Ava are rare Pacific Western bears and if Dr. Dolittle can get them together, the woods will be saved as the two bears will be living there.  The good doctor sets about teaching Archie the ways of the wild in the hopes that Ava will fall for him.  There is one set-back after another with the re-training of Archie and also a pleasant surprise for Dolittle regarding his daughter, Charisse.There are many entertaining and funny moments in this movie but I think it falls a little short of the original.  Even though I believe the first Dr. Dolittle is better, this movie is definitely worth buying, as any Eddie Murphy movie is.  Something tells me there will be a Dr. Dolittle 3 and I will probably buy that one too.",N/A
684929,"Shaolin Mantis (bizarrely also titled Deadly Mantis in this 1983 print)is widely recognized as one of David Chiang Da Wei's best efforts at the Shaw studio, and deservedly so;  it is one of the few not directed by perennial favourite Chang Cheh and therefore has far more character development, intricate sets and cinematography, and even numerous female characters; all features famously lacking from Cheh's beloved comic-book style.  This is also one of the first and best movies to use the device of copying animals to create a fighting style and the painful training sequences that ensue.  The synopsis can be found elsewhere, and I believe nearly any aficionado of these films would give it all five stars.The one issue is the print quality: this &quot;Platinum Collector's Edition&quot; literally opens with video jitter, showing plainly that it was transferred from video (probably someone's home copy), not from film, and it is entirely &quot;pan and scan,&quot; which makes it difficult to follow the action, and not only in the action scenes.  That said, it should not prevent you buying it... it is regrettable, though, that in the age of DVDs, collectors and lovers of these films are still forced to content themselves with mediocre, &quot;Black Belt Theatre&quot;-type copies.

First it gets hammered by a flood of historic proportions this summer - and now this: potential annihilation by a submarine carrying biological weapons  It may make all those people who live there start to wonder if, perhaps, they did something to make the Man Upstairs turn against them.""XXX"" is a spy film for the new millennium.  Sure, it utilizes all the conventions of the genre that have been in place since James Bond made his cinematic debut back in ""Dr. No"" forty long years ago:  international intrigue, fantastic technological gadgetry, a generous helping of sardonic humor, beautiful women (who are, more often than not, really double agents), and, of course, a hero in whose capable hands rests the fate of the entire free (and even not so free) world.  The difference here is that this protagonist is no cocktail-sipping sophisticate like Bond, but rather a lower class, rough-and-tumble, antisocial troublemaker who would rather throw expensive cars off bridges than risk his life for God and country.  That very attitude of devil-may-care devilry makes him the prime candidate for the task of undercover infiltration that the CIA needs done at the moment - or so our hero, known as XXX, is told by Augustus Gibbons (Samuel L. Jackson) who recruits the prison-and-hell-bound ruffian to serve as a mole in a nefarious, underground organization centered in the Czech Republic.Actually, for all its obeisance to the spy-movie formula, ""XXX"" turns out to be quite a fun, rollicking good action film, provided one goes along with the nonsense and doesn't expect too much from it.  It is certainly miles above this summer's earlier spy flick, ""Bad Company,"" which utilized much of the same plotting and even featured Prague as the backdrop for some of its action as well.  In this case, however, the filmmakers have a star worthy of his buildup.  Vin Diesel may not always be able to deliver his lines in a way that is 100% convincing (he is particularly inept in the scene where Gibbons is convincing him that he needs to get with the program rather than risk time in prison), but he does emanate a certain charismatic charm, particularly when called upon to deliver some of those sardonic one-liners that are standard issue for a modern action hero figure.""XXX"" has a clever opening stretch in which our hero is continually put to sleep with a dart gun and finds himself waking up in strange surroundings - courtesy of his boss who wants to test the man's mettle before sending him out into the world he is being called upon to save.  The last half hour, though utterly preposterous by any measure, manages to get the adrenaline going thanks to first-rate photography and split-second editing.  Dean Semler, the film's cinematographer, deserves special praise for his work on this film.  The movie looks, quite frankly, gorgeous.  Luckily, he was handed for his subject one of the most photogenic cities in the world and, I am happy to say, he does it full justice with his camera.Fast-paced, moderately witty and always lovely to look at, ""XXX"" promises to be but the first entry in a long-lived and very lucrative new film franchise.",N/A

430935,"It gave birth to a series of horrible movies (I Know What You Did Last Summer, Urban Legends) but watch it. It's a very clever, funny, exciting, and YES, scary movie. I mean can you watch that very beggining scene with Drew Barrymore, in your basement, at mid-night, and not be scared? That scene's a real masterpiece, and kicks the movie to a very fast start instead of wasting time on nothing.Don't get me wrong, the movie is really fast paced, but it's got great character development. Each character in this movie is well developed and realistic (I'm not kidding).The plot isn't quite your usual ""stupid scary movie with lots of hot girls showing their breasts off and having sex while smoking pot and getting slaughtered by an unkillable, emotionless killer,"" no. Scream has a plot. A year ago, Sydney Prescott's (Neve Campbell) mother (Lynn Mcree) was brutally raped and muredered. Sydney fingers Cotton Weary (Liev Schreiber), and why shouldn't she? She saw him leave wearing his bloody coat and all evidence points to him. However, when Steven Orith (Kevin Patrick Walls), and his girlfriend Casey Becker (Drew Barrymore) pop up dead late one night, and Sydney's friends start dropping dead, she begins to suspect that maybe she fingered an innocent man, and her mother's killer is still on the loose. But, who's the killer?Scream co-stars W.Earl Brown, Courteney Cox (Courteney Cox Arquette), David Arquette, Rose McGowan, Skeet Ulrich, Matthew Lillard, Joseph Whipp, Jamie Kennedy, and and cameos by Wes Craven, and Linda Blair.I know I said this movie isn't just sex, nudity, murder, and gore, but it delivers in some areas (don't get all excited, no nudity). There's a truckload of gore (even more if you can get the director's cut) and lots more guts then I had expected to be in a movie of today. The death scenes are elaborate, well staged and exciting. Even better, we actually care about the teens in this movie. They're likable because they all know that they're in a horror movie and the ""rules.""The cast is excellent, each actor does great. Neve Campbell does sympathetic teen really well, Rose McGowan (as her friend with a variety of skimpy outfits, Tatum) does great. The off-beat boyfriend (Skeet Ulrich) is played well. All the other actors are great, but it could take hours describing them all here.kevin Williamson really did great with his script here. He doesn't think to much of himself like he does now, and givers the movie a never ending energy. Wes Craven (A Nightmare On Elm Street) brings the film to life vividly and I wasn't bored for a second. No dought he helped all the actors in looking scared (marvelously) and the opening with Drew Barrymore must be seen to be believed. That's what I call scary!The DVD (Dimension Collector's Series) is a keeper, despite having some minor problems. One of the (minor) problems is the non-anamorphic transfer. Being an owner of a widescreen TV, this annoys me, but the picture is still genuinely good. It's crystal clear and free of blemishes and grain. It just would have been better with an anamorphic transfer. Still, good picture quality. The second problem is that the version on the DVD is the original theatrical version, and not the director's cut mentioned above. There isn't to much of a difference, but there's more guts, blood, and gore in the unrated version. Just a little problem, again. Nothing extreme.Those problems are basically nothing when you come to the good stuff about the disk. The great commentary by Kevin Williamson and Wes Craven (also on the earlier disk) is here, and it's a real pleasure. I've listened to it several times and still get a kick out of it. They both seem at ease and point out interesting facts I never noticed about the movie. Other features are two trailers (red band and green band) and over five TV spots. there's a short production featurette and a behind the scenes thing that's interesting. There's a cool special effects gallery. Also, you can ask two questions with the cast and crew (""Why are people so fascinated by horror movies?"" and ""What's your favorite scary movie?""). There's also a ""Did You Know"" section that gives out some interesting facts. A nice array of special features.The films remastered in a booming, beautiful 5.1 surround sound that will please all. Dialouge is clear and easy to understand and the action sequences are loud and exciting.Scream's great. I am not ashamed to like it. It's one of my favorite movies and I find it clever and witty. Forget those people who diss this movie and see the masterpiece (the Oscars for 1996 really missed this one). Also, the two sequels are almost just as good. I'd recommend getting the box set (I own it, and love it) because it has an exclusive Collector's Edition of Scream 2 and a bonus fourth disk. It's well priced, too.",Scream VHS

The third and most thought provoking and sometimes hard to watch because of it being so dramatic is where the father defends a black man who is accused of raping a white woman. That scene in general was outstanding. It's easy to see that Gregory Peck won an academy award for best actor. The movie makes you want to read the book, which does give more detail. However, the great thing about this movie is not for the actor's but the fact that it really does follow the book.As for the DVD it's self it was a pleasure to navigate around. Has a wonderful information on production notes. And the idea of an author (Harper Lee) loving a Screen Play is quite unknown so that just tells you how much this movie is loved. The only thing is that the sound was rather hard to hear, however I haven't been able to find a DVD or Video yet that had good sound with this movie. It's still worth the buy you won't be sorry, the picture is great for a black and white film and it's fun re-watching a child's adventure in the times of a depression. I recommend this movie for anyone who's old enough to understand this film, and I garentee after you watch the movie you'll want to read the book. I wanted to re-read the book after I saw the movie again :)",N/A

It is from an unrestored, bad-looking negative and runs only 80 minutes, rather than the 105 release time and the 92 minute length advertised.  It's hard to follow; some scenes are obviously removed.  In one part Rommel is recalled to Berlin for a long rest, only to be seen in Africa 10 minutes later!

It should be duck soup for modern technology to recreate it in at least as good shape as it was originally without trying to change it in any other way. As I recall, the desert photography had the superb realistic quality seldom seen elsewhere (maybe Lawrence of Arabia).

2713,"I watched ""Tenebre"" before and wanted to view it again before writing my review.  Recently I observed a very disappointing Image Entertainment offering of a Mario Bava film (""Hatchet for the Honeymoon"") so I wanted something that would stimulate my senses - right away!My system roared back to life when I chose and played ""Tenebre"".  The surround sound is excellent for the 1982/1983 film and the picture alone I would rate probably --> 3 stars.  There is plenty of color in the murder scenes.  As always, I do not review the movie, directing, or acting, as I prefer to give readers tips on the quality of the DVD.  As such, I highly recommend that you add this DVD to your Dario Argento collection; it's quite thrilling.  Please note that Anchor Bay DVD's do not play well or at all on older DVD players or drives.  Since I upgraded to a 16x drive, all my Anchor Bay DVD's play smoothly including ""Tenebre"".A behind-the-scenes feature of sound effects is quite interesting.  I could also listen to Dario speak about his films, in Italian, all day long.  Of course, I need the translation or subtitles to help.  There is a brief interview with Dario on this DVD with an audio translation.There is plenty of blood and gore in this film for those who love it.  Sounds too!  Also noteworthy is a scene featuring a mature, voluptuous and solid woman who kneels down in front of a group of young men that are only wearing white pants.  It's quite sensual.  For whatever reason, one of the boys hits this woman.  Later he is restrained and this beautiful but rough lady stomps on his face and puts the high heel of her red shoe into his mouth.  It's a very exciting and thrilling scene!  You will enjoy this scene very much as you figure out what it means to ""Tenebre"".",N/A

538960,"For pure entertainment, it's hard to beat a love story wrapped in a war story.  As a war story, Captain Corelli's Mandolin is a failure.  As a love story, it's barely there, but the combination is greater than the sum of the parts.  The story is rich; it's historical, and the cinematography of a sunny Greek island will give any movie a lift.Set in World War II, the Italian army, under the control of the Germans, occupies the Greek Island of Cephallonia.  The islanders are not intimidated in the least, by the Italians.  They regard them as hopeless, spineless cowards and the most pathetic excuse for soldiers.  These soldiers are not real fighting men anyway.  They are musicians in uniform.  Despite the intrusion of the Italian occupiers, these musicians bring a love of music and an enjoyment life, where they can find it, to the war stressed town.Penelope Cruz plays Pelagia, a medical student and daughter of the village doctor.  She has a boyfriend in the village, Madras, who is involved with the Greek resistance.  Nicholas Cage plays Captain Corelii, the ranking Italian officer on the island.  He of course, works on charming the initially hostile Pelagia away from Madras.  The romance is a little frustrating.  It's stretched out over the length of the film without enough romantic, ""Action, "" along the way.I've always liked Nicholas Cage.  By the formulas of Hollywood, he was not perfectly cast as the Captain.  His posture is awkward.  He's not slick, not a classic romantic type.  But the rough fit gives the film some of it's charm.  Penelope Cruz doesn't seem perfectly cast either, but by some magic, she made a Penelope Cruz fan out of me.  On the down side, Cage's accent is horrendous, by the way, and varies throughout the film.  It doesn't hurt the film, but both Cage and Cruz seem far too old for the roles they play.I thought the portrayal of the German officer, Captain Weber, by David Morrissey, was exceptional.  He is not characterized as the stereotypical, Teutonic tyrant.  With very little screen time, I felt his characterization was human, complex, sympathetic and conflicted.Christian Bale's acting, as Madras, is also excellent.  As a member of the Greek resistance and as Captain Corelli's rival for Pelagia, he has every reason to do him.  Observe his non-verbal behavior.In contrast to the Greek islander's initial view of the Italians, in the end, Captain Corelli and his band of musicians turn out to be courageous men of conviction.  The musicians fight, and die, for the love of life, humanity and the love of a woman.  By contrast the Germans fight and kill, for all the wrong things.  And when it came to life and love, it is our German officer, so capable of life and love, who becomes the spineless coward.How sad it was to read in the film's afterward that the German military executed thousands of Italian soldiers on Cephallonia in 1943.  How sad it is that so many films today entertain people with faked violence, exaggerated a thousand fold; yet, we remain ignorant where it was a reality.  By contrast, the makers of Captain Corelli's Mandolin had to minimize showing the historical violence so it would not obliterate the love story.  In the movie there is just violence enough to shock and inform us.The film was based on a historical novel of the same name, by the way.  If you want to know more about the historical incident upon which the movie was based, just search on the Internet for Cephallonia.  It is one of the three Ionian Islands, which also happen to be the birth place of Greek philosophy.  Today, the Greeks have a shrine there for the executed Italian soldiers.  The actual execution sites and places where the bodies were dumped are marked and preserved.  Many Greeks and Italians pray at the sites.",N/A
544539,"2001 was a breakthrough year for Nicole Kidman.  Not only did she get many cover page stories about her heartbreaking divorce, but she finally proved that she was more than Tom Cruise's wife, and that she was a serious dramatic actress. First came the huge success of Moulin Rouge, which established Nicole as a tender beauty, a talented singer, and a symbol of glamour. Then came her finest dramatic role to date, in The Others. This film is not a horror film. It is a melodrama with supernatural overtones. It is about life after death, but it goes much deeper than that.  There is a central message to the story.. At the end, when Nicole says she loves her children, even though we have learned the shocking and gruesome truth about her, we feel sympathy for her.  This is Nicole Kidman's art, and her art alone, making us feel sympathy for her. she is a tremendous actress, and deserves even greater roles. She deserves to follow in the footsteps of the greats...Crawford, Garbo, Dietrich.. And I believe she will. She has the talent, beauty, and class to become a genuine superstar. The Others proves what we suspected all along.There are two scenes in The Others that stand out in my memory. One is when Kidman is lost in the fog and finds her long lost husband. The expression on her face is moving and defiantly sentimental..in a world of actresses that would rather not show such vivid and beautiful emotion. The very best scene, to me, is when Kidman is standing at the gate, after her husband has left her, looking very wistful and sad. It is masterful.The Others is the showcase that Kidman has deserved for a long time. With her performance in this film and Moulin Rouge, Nicole Kidman has covered all the dramatic bases. She is on her way now.",The Others
276440,"If, at some point in this movie, you do not cry, you have got to be made of stone. At its ending, I could not get up from my chair, and was so overwhelmed that I sat there and cried. Now I am better. But I do believe that some of this sorrow will never go away.There is a GREAT cast of actors. I believe this is the best performance of Burt Lancaster. He is mesmerizing throughout the movie. Judy Garland seems full of sorrow herself. Her emotional struggle to find meaning in her life, and the suffering she endures because she cares so very much for the retarded children, are very honestly portrayed. I like her in the final scene of the film when her deep caring combines with her natural vivacity and warmth. Steven Hill is terrific as the father of the child most focused upon in the story. There is a very fine scene between Hill and Paul Stewart, who plays a close working associate of Lancaster, the director of the institution.  And this child himself gives an incredible performance. I believe he should have received a special academy award.""The Children,"" as they are listed in the titles, have many of the retarded among them. Credit must be given to the director's great ingenuity and a kind of genius that he knew how to and succeeded in drawing out excellent performances. In short, he really knew how to work with these kids.The story: Highly educated parents leave their boy in this institution after finally accepting that he is, as his father puts it, ""defective.""  They never visit him.  Garland, who comes to work at the institution, just having given up on a career as a pianist, and the boy form a close bond, and she, against the director's wishes, tries to get the mother involved in the boy's life.  The result is not good, but only more turmoil is caused.  In the end, we find that what is a small victory for a non-retarded person can be a great victory for the mentally impaired.  Garland's character also finds her own strength through what she is able to contribute.Hats off to Cassavetes for taking on so thoroughly, skillfully and brutally honestly a subject which no other film has so deeply explored.",A Child Is Waiting VHS
598243,"As another reviewer below said, I gave up on the film in the EXACT same spot she did....when Ricci's character is walking through the campus and gets disgusted by the garbage, rats and a dead bird.There is a point where some indy films decide that quirky scenes make up for a lack of plot or character devolopment.  Many, MANY things in this film felt rushed, the plotting bordered on schizophrenic (the filmmakers seemed to have a clear vision of &quot;point A&quot; and &quot;point B&quot;, but no clue how to drive the &quot;car&quot; between the two points) and even though you can tell Ricci's character is trying to redeem herself, you have NO clue WHY she is doing so.  A few minutes spent with her &quot;special&quot; charge is supposed to make her entire life turn around?  I just don't get it, and after 45 minutes I didn't want to anymore.

590704,"""Only those who know the supremacy of the intellectual life-the life which has the seed of ennobling thought and purpose within it-can understand the grief of one who falls from that serene activity into the absorbing, soul-wasting struggle with worldly annoyances.""-George EliotIn September, 1947, mathematical genius John Nash spends his time attempting to distinguish himself with a completely original idea at Princeton University in lieu of attending classes. He distances himself from the other students with his introverted and eccentric behavior and admits he doesn't really like people. He is so consumed with thought, he neglects his most basic needs and becomes so absorbed in his own serene thought processes he forgets to eat and sleep.In fact, no one can really relate to him until he meets a beautiful student who attends one of his classes. Alicia (Jennifer Connelly) seems to have the patience to work through situations in real life, that Nash doesn't have time for or is not concerned with. His mind won't let him deal with real life and he is tossed into an unrealistic fantasy by delusions that seek to destroy him. Alicia falls for his mind, they marry and her emotional IQ is so high that she truly shows her husband unconditional love.He enters an imaginary life in which he helps the government break codes in magazines. His wife becomes increasingly aware of his mental condition and tries to help him see what reality truly is. She needs to believe that something extraordinary is feasible. She believes he can conquer anything. The problem is, he is suffering from a mental illness which is seeking to destroy his world.As he descends into a world of his own making, schizophrenia takes over and he has to take medications that interfere with his ability to ""do his job."" This causes him immense grief and he lacks purpose. His job actually turns out to be completely of his own imagination. This espionage part of the story is absorbing and exciting. The emotional elements are highly rewarding and the actual love story was for me at least, overwhelmingly beautiful.Through John Nash's life he learns what is truly important and in that is the true beauty of this story. Ron Howard shows genius in his ability to so capture your heart with his directing.A Beautiful Mind will draw from you those exquisite emotions only a story of great depth and sensitivity can. The characters are genuinely persuasive and screenwriter, Akiva Goldsman crafted one of the most intelligent scripts to date. An exceptional score reflects a complex backdrop of emotions and in this mirror of music the rays of reflection will touch your soul.A Beautiful Mind is an eloquent portrayal of John Nash's life with an emphasis on the emotional torment mental illness can evoke contrast with the sheer beauty of love.Highly Recommended!~The Rebecca Review",N/A

691565,"The fifth season continued the epic mythology expanse, and arguably pushed it into oblivion.  The end of the Vancouver era, this season (according to me) is where things got a bit too complex for Chris Carter to handle with 100% success.  It lead into the movie, which brought the show a new and larger audience, but never really got a full grasp on it's success.  That said, there are some incredible episodes that need mentioning, and make this set worth buying.--Redux (I and II): This is my favourite two parter, and one of the best explorations of trust The X-Files has ever attempted.  Everything is remarkable, from Scully's cancer, to the haunting voiceovers.--Post Modern Prometheus: a dazzling slight of hand from Carter and Co.  This modern fairy tale/frankenstein story had one of those moments that fans die for; that wonderful, insipirational, moving ending.--A Chirstmas Carol/Emily:  Not one of the best, but Gillian Anderson's performance is magnificent in this two parter.--Patient X/The Red and the Black: The final two parter of the fifth season, this show is relentlessly entertaining and challenging.--The Pine Bluff Variant: The best 'stand alone' of the fifth season, a well paced and executed suspense show.--The End:  The cliffhanger before the movie.  Very strong conclusion.So what do I mean when I say 'arguably pushed it to oblivion'?  The overall season is very inconsistent, with some very weak episodes, that don't measure up to previous efforts (Bad Blood, Kitsunegari, Kill Switch).  Plus, the sixth season (despite a great lead in), failed to generate as much interest.The third and fourth season, when taken together, display a rare ambition of an epic nature.  The fifth season fails to live up to the standard set, but this is by no means a waste of time.  If you are a fan, then you probably already know if you're going to get this or not.  If not, then I recommend buying the first four seasons first, (or at least the 3rd and fourth).  If you like it, than the fifth season will be a welcome addition to your collection.",The X-Files - The Complete Fifth Season
147408,"With better direction and acting, I think *Foxy Brown* could have been an awesome film. As it stands, it's pretty much just a decent plot filled with distractions caused by a parade of terrible acting and outrageous '70s fashion (the latter of which, however, is really almost reason enough to see the film).Pam Grier, despite her great sassy attitude and onscreen confidence, seems plagued by terrible delivery of her lines. (There are zero successes, but several attempts at delivering some decent one-liners.) Fortunately, however, Grier's inablility at delivery is overshadowed by the awful acting of Katheryn Loder, who might just have given one of the worst performances I've ever seen by an actress. None of the cast, however, seems particularly talented, with the best being Juanita Brown as the callgirl Claudia and Antonio Fargas as Foxy's perfectly inept, hoodlum brother, Link.It's still a decent flick, though maybe not one you want to put too highly on your ""must see"" list. If the fashion doesn't draw you in, it's worth seeing for Grier's great action scenes and the often laughable and seemingly endless amount of random sexual situations to be found here. If you're a fan of '70s chic, Pam Grier, or Blaxploitation films, it's a definite must. Otherwise, rent it if you like a lot of violence and can't find any Tarantino films.",Foxy Brown VHS

703230,"Probably no film screams ""swinging sixties"" at you as much as Modesty Blaise does with its bright colours and pop art and op art designs, a musical score that is a blend of jazz and pop, a script that seems determined not to make sense, a campy collection of character actors, and direction that seems to have everything but direction. And yet despite all of this - or more probably because of it - the film remains oddly entertaining. And it is definitely a reflection of the era in which it was made. Some of us may watch it with twinges of nostalgia mixed with embarrassment. To say the style of the film is dated is to state the blindingly obvious. But that's part of its charm.If you are willing to dispense with logic and enter into the spirit of the film, the experience can be quite good fun. Based on a popular comic strip and released at a time when every other film was about spies, Modesty Blaise refuses to take itself, or anything else, seriously. Monica Vitti - always a strange choice for the role - is seldom made up to look like the character she is portraying. Terence Stamp, as her sidekick Willie Garvin, seems to be having a great time. Other British stalwarts such as Clive Revill and Harry Andrews happily do their bits. But it falls to Dirk Bogarde and Rosella Falk to go as far over the top as the film's mood and style requires. Falk in particular seems to have realised exactly what was called for by director Joseph Losey.But it is Dirk Bogarde who carries things along and whose performance will be most remembered. It is a performance for which the word ""camp"" might have been invented. With hair, makeup, costume and body language suitably outlandish, he wisely counterpoints them by dryly delivering his dialogue with his trademark underplaying. Only Bogarde could be staked out in a desert and desperately call out: ""Champagne...champagne...""In the end, you almost wonder why Bogarde and Losey made this film, which is such a distinct change of pace from their earlier collaborations. Some of the sequences are brilliantly shot, especially the more realistic Amsterdam scenes early in the film. But having Vitti and Stamp bursting into song was a huge mistake.Like most cult films, Modesty Blaise is an acquired taste and will not appeal to everyone. Fans of sixties excess will love it and admirers of Dirk Bogarde will be amazed by it. Anyone watching it for the first time are advised to keep an open mind.",N/A
476377,"I give the DVD for The Phantom Menace 5 stars, but I would only give the actual movie 3 at the most.  I'm not saying I didn't like it, but I wish it had been different.  I can't say too much that hasn't already been said by many others.  I wish Obi Wan had been the focus of the story, or it might have been interesting if Queen Amidala had been the focus.  What I think the movie is really lacking is a hero the audience can identify with.  Qui-Gon doesn't work as a focal point, because he never really has to face any particular challenges.  It really should have focused on Obi Wan.  Anakin doesn't work as a focus either, because every already knows what becomes of him.  Maybe it would have been interesting if George Lucas had come up with a completely new story set in a totally different time period.  He still could of used the same cast.  I was excited when I first heard of the main cast members, I like Ewan McGregor, Natalie Portman and Liam Neeson, but unfortunately they weren't given anything very interesting to do.  The DVD package however is excellent.  The one hour documentary is one of the best (if not the best) I have ever seen on a DVD.  Besides the main documentary there is a deleted scenes documentary that is very good and a series of short documentaries originally produced for the web.

332363,"I'm a big sci-fi fan, so of course this movie is one of my all-time favorites. But one thing I wanted to mention that amused me about the flick was how well it played among the psychedelic crowd back then.When this movie came out, the headtrippers among my friends and acquaintances, thinking that it would be great to merge the exploration of inner space with the exploration of outer space, perhaps, would get high on LSD and then go see this movie. They especially liked the part with the colorful special effects where Bowen is going through the Star Gate with the equally trippy, dissonant sound track by Gyorgi Ligeti, in the background. I found this pretty amusing, since they were usually too stoned or tripped out to really try to follow the flick or figure anything out about the movie, and many of them weren't really sci- fi fans, anyway. They were just there for the spectacular visual effects, and this movie had what was state of the art at the time.Most of these people eventually got over their fascination with recreational chemicals, but at the time, 2001 and a 20-microgram dose of bathtub LSD was about the coolest scene around for these people.Anyway, I just thought that was sort of funny, since they probably missed the point of the whole movie, if there was one. Well there was, but you really needed to read the book to find that out. The tune in, turn on, and drop out aspect of the movie aside, it's certainly one of the great classics, and possibly Kubrick's greatest flick, also.",N/A

I still marvel at what computers can do today.Secondly, for Liam Neeson's part in general.  He did the part of the wise and kindly Jedi master Qui-gon Jinn, whose apprentice was Obi-wan Kenobi (Ewan McGregor) and who sensed the power behind innocent Anakin Skywalker's (Jake Lloyd) appearance.

Note her attempt to avoid going by trying to commit suicide - she's an impetutous child living in a dream.Paris and culinary school don't do Sabrina much good until she meets a kindly mentor who encourages her to finally grow up and teaches her a few lessons stirred in with the eggs. She returns home in triumph - ushered in by none other than David himself. Though engaged, David pursues Sabrina recklessly, even in front of his future in-laws! David's brother Linus, the consummate businessman, steps in to intervene - David's marriage is also a business merger that means more than his flirtation with the luminous ""chauffer's daughter"" (a phrase oft repeated by the class-conscious snobs in the film).Director Billy Wilder handles this film amazingly. If you watch critically, you see how deep the slightest comment, camera shot, actor's position becomes. The early part of the film is brimming with motifs and hints of things to come, using both people and objects as metaphors. It's all executed so seamlessly, so dextrously, it's not even noticable during pleasure viewing. (For example, notice how Sabrina is always physically above the others - in the tree, on the tennis court, living above the garage - as she is above them as a person) The acting, the actors, the story are so witty, light, sparkling, and graceful, it's like watching a perfect dance. Audrey Hepburn, always a favorite, is positively aglow. Givenchy's costumes don't hurt either.Bogart and William Holden are well-cast as the Larrabee brothers. Bogart's craggy vulnerability and romantic confusion is particularly endearing. Even though some of the film is a bit dated and quaint, it's somehow still classic and relevant. Even the song, ""We Have No Bananas Today"" is oddly funny and appropriate. The pace meanders a bit, but it's like taking a stroll through a lovely garden - just enjoy the moments because there isn't much film-making like this anymore where each viewing only makes it better than the last.Also check out Samuel Taylor's enchanting play Sabrina Fair, which this is based on, but don't bother with the shallow remake with Harrison Ford.  They left out all the subtleties and produced a shell of this glorious original.",N/A
520454,"-MOVIE-""The Fellowship of the Ring"" was absolutely incredible.  Very true to the book in most places, it simply blew me away when I saw it.  The story has always been a favorite of mine, and I had high hopes for this film.  It was thought that a live-action Lord of the Rings was impossible, but Director Peter Jackson has certainly suceeded in bringing it to life.  The astounding special effects highlight and enhance the world of Middle-Earth in ways that they could not have just a few years ago.  While a bit long and tedious, it is arguably one of the best films in recent years.  The DVD format only makes it all the more impressive.  The image and sound enhancements are great to experience.  The 30 minutes of extra footage not only add to the story, but they allow you to see some other characters more in-depth than you could in the Theatrical version.  I find that the original version flows a little better, but I also find myself drawn to the Extended edition because of those little additions that will become more important later on.-SPECIAL FEATURES-All I can say is ""Wow.""  Two discs filled with documentaries.  To some people this material is completely worthless.  Well, watching these features helps you gain a much better understanding of Middle-Earth, the planning, the shooting, and the visual effects.  The two documentaries that I especially liked were ""The Fellowship of the Cast"" and ""A Day in the Life of a Hobbit.""  In these two features, the castmembers share their experiences on and off the set throughout the months of filming.  If you like these, then the Cast Audio Commentary is also fun to listen to.  It doesn't stop there.  These discs are filled with a truckload of stuff that takes hours to watch.  Even if you find the documentaires and ""Making Of"" features on DVDs boring, you just may want to watch some of these.Overall, this is one of the greatest DVD collections ever put on the shelves.  Perhaps THE greatest.",The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring

There is a certain truth to this, but Charlie Chan and company were neither more nor less stereotypical than such other popular series as the &quot;Blondie&quot; or &quot;Dr. Kildare&quot; series, and--while we may occasionally roll our eyes at a few 1930s sensibilities--its stereotypes are never mean-spirited and Charlie (along with his various sons) is always presented in a positive light.This particular Chan episode is one of the best of the Sidney Toler vehicles, and unlike most other Chan films actually generates considerable atmosphere with its tale of a killer run wild in a mysterious wax museum, where all is not as it seems.  Victor Sen Yung plays &quot;number two son&quot; Jimmy Chan very broadly, and the film is rounded out with a very able and entertaining cast.  As with most Chan films, everything is &quot;over the top,&quot; but WAX MUSEUM never goes so far over the top that it becomes pure camp; it remains an unpretentious, simple little movie that is quite a lot of fun to watch, and both fans of the series as well as newcomers will enjoy it quite a bit.",N/A

544363,"First off, I'm gonna just go right ahead and tell you that this movie was the best thriller I have seen in a very long, long, long time. They don't make them like this anymore. What a shame. We need more scary thrillers like this. Writer/director AlejandroAmenabar really delivers the goods. The fantastic Nicole Kidman stars as Grace, a rather cold, icey mother of two who lives in a large and spooky mansion circa 1945. She has hired three new servants to help in her home after her previous employees just vanished. Just left. Her children, Anne and Nicholas, suffer from a rare disease that makes them break out in blisters and suffocate if they come in contact with light. Because of this, the house curtains are pulled and the place is usually in the dark. Spooky. The little girl believes the place is haunted when she keeps seeing people. Her mother and brother refuse to hear it. Strange things begin to happen and they only get more and more odd until Grace is forced to believe her daughter. The movie is great. Nicole Kidman gives the best performance of her career. She is no longer ""Mrs. Tom Cruise"" and this movie proves it. Anyone who thinks otherwise, is clearly wrong. She was nominated for an Oscar for ""Moulin Rouge"", but she deserved it more for this performance. The acting and accent are dead on perfect. The kids are great. We don't see such great kid actors too often, but these two were very good. I could listen to their accents all day. The movie looks really good and is shot magnificently. A gorgeous looking movie. It's full of interesting plot turns that ends in a surprise climax that beats the hell out of the ending of ""The Sixth Sense"". The one star review below is ridiculous beyond belief. The house and fog are shot incredibly. The atmosphere of this film is just as important and thrilling as the actors and the action. The music is superb as well. This movie, along with Alejandro's superb direction and storytelling, tells you that you can have a truly epic, scary, mysterious, and overall satisfying movie experience with the things that you don't see, as much as the other movies filled with make-up, special effects, and CGI computer generated effects. The best kind of thriller are the ones about true fear that make you create it in your own mind. Not spoon fed to you by eye popping Hollywood tricks and camera trickery. All you need is a solid story and good actors. This movie has those things and then some. Superbly done folks. If you like a good haunted house movie, this one is the best in eons. As I've already said before, this is the best thriller I've seen in many a moon. The people who didn't get it are laughable. This movie is wasted on them. I suggest they go back to watching ""Temptation Island"". Make yourself a bowl of popcorn, get comfy on the couch, turn off the lights, and get ready for an immensley enjoyable thriller. This is a good movie.",The Others
579006,"The best of Roger Corman's AIP Edgar Allen Poe flicks, and a superior horror film.Vincent Price is a Spanish nobleman haunted by the sins of his Inquisitor father.  While a small boy, Price accidentally witnessed his sadistic sire murder his uncle and wall-up his mother alive, believing them to have committed adultery together.  His greatest fear, since that day, has been that his evil father's genes will somehow evidence themselves in him.  Now an adult, the gentle Price discovers he has accidentally buried loving wife Barbara Steele while still alive, and is near suicidal with grief.  But his suffering has only begun.  His wife's spirit seems to be coming after him  -  or is it something worse?Vincent Price and Barbara Steele never turned in better performances.  Before the story is done, each of them get to play both victim and vengeful ghost  -  which can't be explained without ruining the sinisterly splendid plot, penned by veteran horror screenwriter Richard Matheson.  The imagery is hauntingly grotesque, the atmosphere and mood often unbearably intense.  Price has a mad scene that is simply unforgettable.The movie gets off to a slow start, but once it kicks into high gear, it grabs you by the vitals and won't let go.  Young hero John Kerr is a bit wooden, but performs capably enough to further the frightening plot.  The always wonderful Luana Anders plays Price's sister, who gets to narrate the tale  -  with stylishly done flashbacks  -  of her and Price's evil progenitor.  The sets are gorgeous.  The soundtrack is especially effective, a combination of low, lengthy bass notes and frenetic, atonal percussion.This is Gothic and psychological horror at its finest.

I've also seen a bit of her acting in `Balloon Farm'. Oh yes, let's not forget the popular `Mrs. Doubtfire', where she was first seen. In `Matilda', Mara plays an extra-smart little girl, who discovers that she has magical powers later on in life. The parents don't take care of her, often refers to Matilda as a `mistake'. Her father (Danny DeVito) sells used cars for unfair prices, and her mother (Rhea Perlman) goes to play bingo everyday.It was not until one specific day that Matilda realized she was super-smart. Harry (dad) came home all excited because he sold cars for a good `deal'. He asks Mikey (brother) to write down numeral digits on a piece of paper and expected him to solve it [without a calculator, nothing.. poor kid!]. He couldn't do it, but Matilda could! She instantly said the answer aloud...THAT'S INCREDIBLE!!!Now it's time for Matilda to go to school. Time for her to get smart [like she's not a genius already, hehe]. Okay, lemme summarize the ppl in her school: Miss Honey is Matilda's teacher, who is truly wonderful [I wish all teachers were like that], Miss Trunchbull is a real [bull], and I think she got what she deserved at the end.Overall, this is a great movie for both adults and kids to watch!

681965,"An unbelievably bad, ego trip of a movie.  The entire script seemed to be a thinly veiled excuse to push Mariah's already inflated ego into something approaching a god complex.  Every scene screamed a dual message:  that Mariah/Billie was the most talented singer in the world, and that she was the most beautiful woman in the world.  I came away from the movie convinced that both were as far from the truth as possible.  Nearly every action and every line of dialogue was a cliche.  Even the &quot;dramatic plot twists&quot; that they threw at us came off as silly and annoying.  We found ourselves laughing hysterically at a movie that was trying to be high drama and yet fell very short.  Also, we literally lost track of the number of scenes.  It was as though they wanted to put in as many very brief scenes (most of which went nowhere) as they possibly could.  If we could sit through it again we'd probably count the scenes, and wouldn't be surprised if there turned out to be over a hundred scenes, many of which lasted less than a minute.

Lord Farquaad decides to get a wife. He chooses the lovely Princess Fiona. But Princess Fiona is held prisoner by a fierce dragon. Shrek the Ogre is sent on a quest with his donkey sidekick voiced to perfection by Eddie Murphy. In return he wants to get his swamp back.Shrek basically pokes fun at the fairy tale gender.

587929,"This film gets very high marks for technical excellence for a war story with good action footage, but the story is so contrived and unbelievable that the film plays more like a fantasy adventure than a realistic war film.  We are asked to swallow so many events that just wouldn't happen that the film loses a good deal of credibility.Who could possibly believe that the U.S. would sit still while N.A.T.O. dictated that we must not attempt the rescue of a downed pilot becaue it might upset the peace process in Bosnia?  That is utter nonsense.  And are we to believe that an entire platoon of soldiers with automatic weapons all firing simultaneously could not hit the constantly dodging Burnett?  Not likely.  There are numerous other plot contrivances that require extraordinary suspension of disbelief, but most of them are critical plot elements so I will refrain from possible spoilers.John Moore is a rookie director that does a terrific job with the technical elements of the film.  He presents a very realistic look and feel in the carrier scenes and the air combat scene is first rate.  Actually, all the action sequences are outstanding, no doubt in large part due to the work of twenty year stunt veteran Steve Davison (""End of Days"", ""Batman and Robin""), who was the second unit director and stunt coordinator.  This film also blends stunt photography seamlessly with visual effects to produce extremely realistic action scenes.  However, when it comes to managing the screenplay, Moore seems to just assume that the writers are the best judge of how the plot is presented, or he doesn't connect with the concepts plot and character believability.This is Owen Wilson's first film in the lead and while he does a good job, he just isn't serious action-hero material.  Wilson projects a naturally sarcastic, smart aleck personality that works in some of the scenes in this film, but when it gets to the macho action sequences, he just can't carry it.  He was terrific in Shanghai Noon, where the action was all tongue-in-cheek.  In that film, his wisecracking humor was a perfect fit.  However, this film gives him little opportunity to display his fabulous comedic talents and he is adrift trying to play the survivor.Gene Hackman plays a supporting role and as always gives us a solid performance as Admiral Reigart.  I can't keep track of how many military movies (mostly naval) David Keith has been in since ""An Officer and A Gentleman"".  He must be on only one call list.  He always gives a credible performance in these roles and this one is no different.  Joaquim de Almeida is dreadful as Admiral Piquet of N.A.T.O. command.If you like action films and you are not too fussy about implausible stories, this film delivers.  I rated it a 7/10 based on the marvelous stunt work and visual effects and the realistic military look and feel.",Behind Enemy Lines

Still, as long as you conform properly and don't wish for the ways of the old world, listening instead to the garbled mixture of religion and healthy obscenities mouthed by the community's priest, you'll be fine. The problem comes when the priest's son, already furious with his father and the way that he treats his little band of miscreant friends, finds his girlfriend's virtues impeded upon and he's forced to introduce a cross and his father's eye to one another. This unfortunately leads him to be sentenced to death, one that the acting gods should have forced down his throat, but his friend's, curse their black hearts, unfortunately saved him. So, exile ensues and they wander for a time until, on the horizon, the ruins of Seattle are found.After being buried in a storm that almost claimed their lives, the band of horrid actors find themselves in a lair that looks very much like a stage prop and some dressing rooms, confronted by two very odd, very energetic, souls. After being properly introduced to a variety of vices that include but are not limited to bodily fulfillment and a vast array of pharmaceutical delights, they find themselves slowly immersed in a most horrid existence, one that spins out of control as the theme progresses forward and Stan Winston is finally allowed to play.Sadly, I have to say that this movie was something that I found very, very disappointing. I had thought that it, because of its Creature Feature logo, would be something of merit, walking the line that the others (Earth vs. The Spider, She Creature, The Day the World Ended, and so on) had. Unfortunately, this thought was thrown out a tad too quickly and I'm still reeling from the brunt of the shock. While I did enjoy certain things about the movie, the actors finding themselves within the ruins of Seattle and the clothing-optional settings that they brought with them, not to mention the effects by Stan Winston, the caption on the front of the movie proclaiming that it isn't so great wasn't far from the truth.

86796,"The Shining makes one realize how utterly hard, almost impossible it is to make a scary movie. ...But the Shining, jesus this movie is so creepy. It just gets inside your head. It's scary to even think about this movie. I'm certainly not a film student or critic like some of the reviewers here but I'm in awe of Kubrick's accomplishment.I thought as I watched it the last time about how Kubrick engineers this mounting sense of unease and dread in the viewer.I believe that he makes the movie look very unnatural in quite subtle ways. Most scenes are brightly lit, and I noticed that there are not many shadows in the movie. Even in brilliantly lit scenes, you'll notice that things don't cast shadows. The colors are frequently bright pastels but don't have a patina, in other words don't reflect light, don't look at all shiny. I also noticed that so many of the scenes are set up symmetrically. From the scenes in the hallways, to the bathroom meeting between the butler and Jack, to the bedroom of Scatman Crothers, there is frequently a very symmetrical appearance of the room that I find, for some reason, highly unsettling. I think the shot of Crothers watching TV in his Miami bedroom, where the viewer watches from Crothers' viewpoint, and all you can see is his lower legs and feet, the lower half of the bed, and then this highly symmetrical, almost stylized tableaux with the TV, the odd nude painting and wall ornaments, this scene I found very disturbing. I don't know why, it is almost like a Rorschach inkblot releasing some subconscious fear or anxiety. There is also a scene in which the viewer is looking at Jack in bed, then the camera pulls back and you see you were actually seeing his reflection in a mirror, then the camera goes BACK into the mirror for the rest of the scene. It again feels very unnatural and unsettling, as if you can't trust your own eyes. Another unnatural feature is Shelley Duvall. Her performance in this movie has been denigrated but I think it is remarkable. But, she is an unusual looking woman. Coal-black hair, buck teeth, bug eyes, she is just, again, unnatural looking. Definitely not the usual femme fatale or spunky mom. There is never a moment in this movie where she gets a steely look in her eye, or sets her jaw, or makes some cold-blooded comment that lets us know she intends to fight and live. She seems weak,confused and beaten the whole movie. But Duvall can really act weak and confused and horrified. Just check out her face as she begins to read Jack's manuscript (""all work and no play..."") as her expressions veer from interest, to confusion, and finally to horror as she realizes that her husband has truly gone mad. And I love, I mean truly love, the scene where the butler spills something on Jack and then shepherds him into the bathroom to clean him up. Notice this, that you do not see the butler's face for the first two thirds of the scene, except a brief and incomplete glimpse as the spill occurs. Again, to be watching an extended scene in a brightly lit (and highly symmetrical) bathroom with only two actors in the scene and yet not really be able to see one of the actors' face is unnatural and somehow unsettling.And here's this, the scene in the hotel room with the bathing woman. What in the scene lets us know that, as Jack is kissing her, that something is horribly wrong? You can barely see any of her face, just part of her hair and her profile, but she isn't moving at all. She looks dead, although if you stopped the film and examined the frames individually there is nothing to suggest she isn't the beautiful woman  who exited the tub.This is a horrifying scene, again highly symmetrical except for the shower curtain only halfway open. Again, weird,flat pastel colors.The first time I saw this movie, in a theater, when Jack was kissing her, a woman in my row screamed at the top of her lungs in sheer unfiltered terrror, and then,crying, immediately left the theater. This is powerful psychological stuff. An absolute masterpiece of slowly mounting unease and fright.The only other movie that comes even close to this level of subtle terror, of mounting amorphous dread, is Rosemary's Baby.But no horror movie has the ability to get inside my head and truly unnerve me the way The Shining can. An amazing and absolutely essential movie.",N/A

It's difficult to come up with fresh situations for familiar characters, but combining the genres of horror and science fiction provides undreamt-of potential.""Hellraiser: Bloodline"" is the perfect example of the way it should be done.Director Alan Smithee weaves an intricate tale of old favorite Pinhead, and introduces inspired new elements to the ""Hellraiser"" mythos. I hope to see another genre film from this talented director; ""Burn Hollywood Burn"" was a departure from his skills as a Space ""Chopera"" auteur.Frightening events become even more terrifying when set on a spooky spaceship, or desolate alien moon. ""Alien 3"" and ""Event Horizon"" are science-fiction movies with scary elements, thus it only makes sense that scary movies with science-fiction elements would be just as cool.

541004,"Tim Burton's ""re-imagining"" of the classic 1968 original is big on spectacle but short on story. Starting out like traditional sci fi film (albeit with Mark Wahlberg- what's he doing here?), Planet of the Apes is a very different plot from the first one, and one with lots of spectacle and action, but not so much substance.The plot of the film is very action-orientated and made me want for more background story. Sure, the action set pieces are great, but to have more on how the rouge humans came to the planet ruled by apes would have been appreciated. But like many action films recently the action and SFX make up for the usual lack of a meaty story (or script for that matter).However, Burton's visionary flair does not disappoint, in that sense the film is fantastic, as is Tim Roth as General Thade, leader of the army of apes, and the imposing Michael Clarke Duncan as one of the commanders of the army. The only stink of this movie actually, is the aforementioned Mark Wahlberg, who threatens to redefine the term ""wooden"".After some huge battle scenes we go to the legendary ending, which understandably confused viewers. Where the original's ending was great, this one is a real thinker, and when it was released, opinions of its climax flew over the net as fast as naked Brittneys.The DVD is great though, and makes for some awesome entertainment with great visuals.

They then go to the customer service area and ask what it's about. They are sent to a place where John Cleese is the host. He tells them that they are to embark on a race for $2,000,000. They have to get from Las Vegas to Silver City, New Mexico.I don't want to tell you anymore because it will ruin the great belly laughs you'll have.

The budget wasn't there, the actors didn't have their charachters yet and the writers didn't really know what kind of a show they where writing for yet.  One thing this DVD set has going for it though is it is SO ... cheap compared to other series which are being released in there entirety.  So I guess you'd say, I recomend this if you ahve a few bucks to spare and plan on buying the rest of the series, cause otherwise just wait till season two comes out or just watch the reruns on FX.",N/A
704167,"The ""Party At The Palace"" Is quite possibly the worst allstar concert ever filmed. At 3 hours[way too long], the viewer is forced to digest a mix of rock n roll legends and a bunch of young british no-names who sing classic Motown tunes [give me a break]. ... You get to hear Ricky Martin, S Club 7, Phil Collins singing ""You Can't Hurry Love""[how about a Genesis tune Phil?], and then the dreaded Moteens including Atomic Kitten, Will Young, Blue, Emma Bunton, Mis-Teeq, Toploader and the Corrs [who the hell are these people?] all singing ... cover versions of your favorite sixties classics. Tom Jones is here singing a horrible rendition of ""You Can Leave Your Hat On"" as though he was performing at some casino on the Vegas strip. I hope he apologized to Joe cocker after the show for butchering the tune. Queen tries valiently to impress but without Freddie Mercury it becomes obvious you can't bring back the past. Tony Bennet seems totally out of place here as does Cliff Richard. Despite all this the last hour of the Dvd has some worthy moments. Brian Wilson's stage appearance continues to be stuperous, his performance of ""California Girls"", ""The Warmth Of The Sun"", ""God Only Knows"", and ""Good Vibratios"" however, was one of the high points of the show. Although the elder statesman of British rock Eric Clapton[Layla], Steve Winwood[Gimmie Some Lovin], Joe Cocker[With A Little Help From My Friends], Rod Stewart[Handbags and Gladrags], Ray Davies of Kinks fame[Lola] and Paul McCartney[Hey Jude] give some fine perfomances of their signature tunes during the last hour of the concert, it is not enough to offset the awful first 2/3rds of the show. If you need to hear Clapton, McCartney, Stewart and Cocker you should buy their individual concert DVD's and avoid this mess at all costs.",N/A

678680,"Wow! This concert, quite simply, is the best ever captured on film. It will move you, excite you, rock you and drain you. It's the perfect antidote to terror, to tedium and to the daily insanities that we all face.U2 already had a powerful message before Sept. 11, born in the troubles in Ireland, expanded by their decades of seeking out truth and opposing despair, prejudice and destruction.U2 has been the most influential, most meaningful band of the past 20 years, singing powerfully of love, hate, war, terrorism, famine and simple pop happiness too. They have the whole repertoire, and it's amply on display here.But for me, the band has taken on a new, powerful meaning given the enormity of the Sept. 11 tragedy.Listening to Stuck in a Moment and New York are eerie now; they have an uncanny resonance effect. The fact that the show was filmed months before the World Trade Center towers collapsed somehow does not matter -- they had the message all along, but not enough were listening.When Bono strikes up, ""How long, how long must we sing this song"" on Sunday Bloody Sunday, we feel it much more in our guts than we ever did before Sept. 11. How long indeed.Lyrically strong, rhythmically solid, signaturally U2, this is just a great DVD -- a brutal exposing of the shallow nature of the other pop acts out their right now.The DVD has a lot of great songs, and it looks fabulous on film. The lighting especially is right on.As others mention, the editing is far too herky-jerky. Remember, the band picked a guy who had only done awards shows prior to this -- where keeping a fickle TV audience's attention is paramount. Mr. Hamish needs to realize that people who buy the DVD aren't going to switch the channel, and give us a chance to savor the band.And, as in every live show, not every performance is rock solid. Bono's voice goes in and out a few times.But these are minor quibbles.The highlight of the DVD is, without a doubt, ""Where the Streets have no name"" -- the song that was played live during the NBA Finals. It's absolutely gorgeous, the band is pumped and the sound quality is unsurpassed. There is magic in the air, and it comes right through your speakers and into your heart.BTW, anyone else notice that the Britney/NSYNC/Backstreet era has crashed and burned? Pop songs and war generally do not go hand in hand. U2 is one of those bands that can thrive in any environment, and we need them now more than ever.Peace.",N/A
681971,"...as people made it out to be. Sure Mariah isn't the best actress, but this movie was well done. The setting in the 80's was perfect, it wasn't fake looking or cheap, Mariah and the producers of this movie really captured the essence of the 80's with this movie. The music used (the songs that were used as background music, not the ones on her album GLITTER) were very significant of the 80's for sure. The songs she recorded for the soundtrack GLITTER speak mountains after seeing the movie, it makes far more sense now after seeing it. When you hear her sing &quot;Reflections (Care Enough)&quot;, a song about wondering why her mother gave her up, and if she really cares, is heartwrenching and I think was an important part of the movie. &quot;Never Too Far&quot; is one of the most beautiful songs Mariah has written (and sang) since 1997's BUTTERFLY album. The movie was good, I think its important to see it for yourself and forget about the critics, because its not as bad as everyone made it out to be. Give it a chance.",Glitter

526963,"I had heard of &quot;Shanghai Noon&quot; when it had first come out, but didn't have much interest in it. But a few weeks ago I decided to try it out once and found it thoroughly entertaining!Princess Pei Pei (Lucy Liu) decides to leave the Forbidden City of China to go off to America. But when she arrives in Carson City with her English teacher, she realizes she has been in fact kidnapped, master minded by a traitor, Lo Fong (Roger Yuan). It's up to the Chinese Imperial Guards to save her. One Imperial Guard, Chon Wang (Jackie Chan) is separated from his fellow mates and is stuck in the West without a clue where Carson City is! He ties up with Indians for a while, marrying the beautiful Indian princess, Falling Leaves (Brandon Merrill) then gradually teams up with 'not quite your average outlaw' Roy O'Bannon (Owen Wilson). With the Marshall Nathan Van Cleef (Xander Berkeley) on their tale, will they ever save the princess?PLOT: The plot of the story is average if not very original. But the acting, action, and humor makes &quot;Shanghai Noon&quot; to be a five-star great movie!ACTING: Though most people may not believe it, this is my first Jackie Chan movie to watch. Throughout the whole movie he has this sort of wise yet innocent manner about it since he has no clue how to act in the west. Lucy Liu does not come out that much in the movie yet she has her moments. She's so regal that she's great for the part of the princess in captive. Brandon Merrill, a real-life rodeo champion, is very cool as another princess with lots of guts, getting Jackie Chan and Owen Wilson out of trouble. But I must say, Owen Wilson of Roy O'Bannon steals the whole film. He's just so into his part that you can't believe he's only acting!ACTION: As all Jackie Chan movies are, &quot;Shanghai Noon&quot; is action packed. Because it's a movie how 'East meets West', it has both kung fu and gun fighting. Chan gets to use antlers, a horshoe whip, his pony-tail, and other ingenious weapons while the character of Roy gets to use his 'skills?' as a gunfighter. Lots of great scenes but my favorites are: the bar fight scene, the two Roy O'Bannon versus the Marshall 'stand-offs', and Jackie Chan versus Lo Fong.HUMOR: The whole movie is filled with lots of one-liners you just naturally memorize and subtle (and sometimes not so subtle) humor. Most of the humor is given off to perfection by Owen Wilson though Jackie Chan has his moments. Here are a few of my favorite lines:Roy O'Bannon: My name's Roy O'Bannon.Chon Wang: Chon Wang.Roy O'Bannon: &quot;John Wayne&quot;? That's a terrible cowboy name! That's not going to work. And neither is the ponytail.Roy O'Bannon: We're men, not pinatas!Roy O'Bannon: On the count of three. 1... 2... 2 1/2... 2 and 7/8... 3!Roy O'Bannon: I may not know karate, but I know crazy.And basically the whole movie is simply hilarious. There's some bloopers at the end of th movie that is just funny! I especially love the one when Jackie Chan is 'fixing' Owen Wilson's shoulder! The music is very cool also, not at all the normal 'western type' of music you would listen to in a typical western movie, but of course, &quot;Shanghai Noon&quot; is NOT a typical western movie. I highly recommend it for anyone how wants a good laugh and some great action/adventure.PG-13 RATING: The movie is rated PG-13 because of language and some scenes. Best for older teenagers and adults.",Shanghai Noon

521985,"It's Anime alright, but it isn't your typical Anime.  I would classify this under Classical Anime in a heartbeat but it also finds itself to be the first anime for most people.  Personally... it was my 4th Anime Movie.Genre/Setting: Fantasy, Ancient Times surrounding the initial invention of the Gun and the mining of Iron.Art Style, realistic and very beautiful, a worthy Masterpiece of art.  As you can tell i really enjoyed it.Nudity: NONE... most anime has a little... even if it's a small insignificant scene it at least has something, but this anime... nope, not a thing.  A major reason it can be viewed with the entire family there.Violence is low in comparison to other Anime.  But for the family scene, this Anime contains scenes of cartoon death, dismemberment and animal attacks.It is the story of a young man who becomes cursed while saving his village from a demon.  The demon is actually a large Bore that became possesed by hatred when he was shot by a human.  The curse will spread throughout the young man's body until it kills him.  So, in the meantime he will journey to the heart of the evil behind the bore's hatred to learn for himself the truth ""with eyes unclouded by hate"", so that he may find peace.  From there the plot unfolds.This is not a sword battle movie and though the image on the cover may appear like a lightsaberesque duel is taking place, i assure you it is not based on combat.  In fact the young man in the image rarely takes up his sword in any sort of battle... he's better with his arrows.  And as misleading as the Title may be, it does not have some sort of Helpless princess... Princess Mononoke is just a title given to the daughter of the wolf god.  The movie does have large animals who are like gods and even a forest god who reigns over all of them, but there is no preaching of this religion.On the cast list are names like Claire Daines, Mimi Driver, Billybob Thorton, Gillian Anderson (who plays the role of the Wolf god, whose japanese voice is done by a really deep bass... kinda confusing).  With such names as these taking up the role then it's gotta have something in it right?  And i hear that it almost ran off with #1 movie in Japan, falling to the hyped up Titanic.  It is an anime that the entire family can enjoy and one that will remain classic to all Anime fans, casual and hardcore.  It was one of the first anime's my family saw, and trust me that the kids will love it... at least all the kids i know of have loved it.",Princess Mononoke
221710,"This 1974 film takes the classic film noir detective movie to new heights.  Yes, there is murder, scandal and lots of lies.  But yet Jack Nicholson, cast as a private eye, is a sympathetic character.  There's one scene in which the director, Roman Polanski, playing a bit part as a thug, rips open Nicholson's nose with a knife.  This is the kind of wound that makes the audience grimace every time someone refers to it in the film.  Faye Dunaway is cast as the femme fatale.  She's beautiful, of course, and it's hard to take our eyes off of her.  She's a woman of mystery, but little by little we glimpse her humanity.  And by the time her secret is revealed, she's won everyone's heart.Based on a real life scandal in Los Angeles in 1908, another underlying theme is about water and power in this desert city.  The action takes place in the 1930s, and the details of that period of time are well portrayed, right down to Faye Dunaway's shaved and penciled eyebrows. The screenplay won an Academy Award and I can understand why.  It was tightly written and revealed details that moved the plot forward at just the right pace.  I sat there fascinated, not wanting to take my eyes off the screen, trying to figure out what would happen next and constantly surprised by the next twist and turn.  John Huston is cast in the role of a wealthy landowner with a huge secret of his own.  He's a fine actor and his presence on the screen added depth to the whole production.The DVD has a special interview with the writer, Robert Towne, as well as Roman Polanski.  This added to my enjoyment of the film and provided further insight about its production.  Definitely recommended.",N/A

456761,"This DVD has a nice picture and is a two-sided DVD: side one is the German Language edition which is also presented with 5.1 Dolby sound and a commentary with Werner Herzog and an interviewer. Side two consists of the English langauge edition (which was actually filmed separately in parts), and has a nicer picture quality of the two sides.I don't see the emphasis on the ""pure"" German soundtrack as Isabelle Adjani and the little comic who plays Renfield are both French actors and their voices are overdubbed. Herzog himself also confesses that much of the film was filmed by English speech as it is a more ""international language"" than is German. Besides, the film just seems to ""work"" better in English in my opinion (as does Aguierre for other reasons).The image quality is good, but not ultimately great - it's a bit grainy in places. The screen is presented in a shallow 1.85:1 widescreen format and includes a behind the scenes featurette and several trailers.

517269,"This is the original Vampire Hunter D, done in 1985 under the direction of Toyoo Ishida.  It tells a different story than the animation made in 2001 ('Bloodlust'), done by Yoshiaki Kawajiri, but shares the same world and main character.  The beautiful character designs of Yoshitaka Amano originally done for the novel series by Hideyuki Kikuchi are the artistic core of both films.The story is set in 12,090 A.D., as millennia of rule by vampires slowly come to an end.  While vampires are increasingly rarer, those that are left still rule the night, making use of their mutant and werewolf servants to help them gain access to human prey.  They are the oldest, and the only threats to them come from the vampire hunters.  One such hunter is D, a dunpeal (damphir) - the child of a vampire and a human.On a lonely night Doris Ran, a young farmer, waits on a road for D, willing to offer anything if the eerie killer can rescue her from the plans of Count Magnus Lee - who has selected her as a human consort.  Bitten by the vampire, suspected by all the villagers, Doris has little chance for survival if D cannot stop the elder vampire's plans.  Standing in D's way are Lee's own deluded childe Ramika and his servant, Ray Ginsay, who has the singular ability to bend time so that the attacker becomes the attacked.  This struggle will take all of D's powers and cunning.The film makes an interesting contrast of D and his opponent Magnus Lee.  Equal in heritage, Lee is the magically stronger, but half-human D can walk in the sunlight.  Both are doomed to lonely lives.  For Lee, there is no longer a society of vampires.  For D, there are none like him; his powers are a curse that makes life as a human impossible.It is probably unfair to compare the two films, both have excellent stories and superb illustration, even though 15 years of technology separates them.  Perhaps the 2001 version comes closer to Yoshitaka Amano's original artwork, but the older plot seems truer to what Hideyuki Kikuchi was doing.  However, this is splitting hairs - they are each excellent examples of their genre.  Whichever you see first, you will soon want to view the other as well.",Vampire Hunter D VHS

It is a typical 2 hour pilot, introducing it's characters, showing the general formula of the show, although the show was redone after the first few episodes, and lets you see if you want more of it.  The problem with this DVD is, if you want more, flip it over, and that is all you get.  You get one and only one of the best episodes of the series, with one major flaw.  If you haven't seen the series before, you are lost in land speed record time.

The realism of the Dragon's movements are pretty natural and you can tell they spent alot of time with the CGI. There is a lack of visuals, but this is not a blockbuster movie, so I forgive. The problems lie in some of the peripheral actors abilities to make me believe their performances, some story holes here and there, and a lack of funding. I thought several times ""I wish they had spent $10 million more on this movie"".With that said, I liked it alot and was surprised at how involved I had become with the story.

Needless to say I was thrilled when I heard these DVDs are being released.  To all of those who are grumbling about it not being issued as deluexe complete season boxed sets, I'd like to offer some food for thought.* These classic shows have already been issued on DVD as part of an exclusive Colombia House Collector's Edition series, but even there they are not issued as complete season sets.  With this as the second DVD release of the series, expectations aren't very high for a third, so don't hold out for Complete Season sets.  These are the best we're going to get until they finish all the volumes of Season 1 - they MIGHT just box all the volumes and make a complete season set available, but it would be no better in terms of content than this, and you'd have to wait longer for them to get done releasing them in volumes and box them.  If you're a true Lucy lover and have to have the complete series on DVD, just get these and stop complaining.* Complete Season sets are VERY expensive, sometimes over [dollar amount] even on discount.  At [dollar amount] apiece retail, these DVDs are a steal compared to season sets.  It probably WOULD be cheaper in the long run as season sets, and they'll end up making more money off us loyal Lucy lovers this way, BUT in the short term it's a sweeter deal.  Most two hour movies are [dollar amount], and you're telling me I can get two hours worth of I LOVE LUCY shows for [dollar amount] and four hours for [dollar amount] if I buy Volume 2 as well?  YAY!!* On Complete Season sets, it only raises the price to produce bonus discs when the series takes up so many discs -- 5 or 6 for normal sets -- anyway.  Here we get the episodes AND bonus features.  Plus, since they're taking so many individual discs to do it, in the end we have MORE ROOM for bonuses then most Complete Season sets.  I for one cannot wait to see the original animated openings and here episodes of Lucy and Dezi's radio show MY FAVORITE HUSBAND.  Plus we get goofs, bluffs, cast/crew info, and occasionally LOST FOOTAGE restored into the episodes!  Yay, no?!I hope this food for thought has helped some of you complainers get past the fact that Complete Season sets are not a reality for I LOVE LUCY, and I hope that you'll buy these DVDs anyway so that you too may enjoy this American TV classic at your pleasure instead of waiting for them to rerun your favorite episode.

705009,"I think this movie is too fragmented and interrupted for someone who (like me) is a complete neophyte to the Evangelion TV series. It seems to be an ambitious summary, made by cutting/pasting small and sparse fragments of relevant chapters or events of the long series into the much more limited movie time frame.  I haven't seen the series, but just judging this movie on its own, it is way too fragmented and over-compressed.  It gave me an impression of too many omissions of important developments, and I found it somewhat frustrating to try to follow.  Obviously the makers assumed the viewers would know some things about Evangelion that I didn't know at all.  Some examples of the weak points I found: at some times the movie suddenly starts explaining (e.g. resolving) some issues as if it was perfectly clear to the viewer that those were pending issues in the plot, when I didn't even had a clue about the existence of those issues in the movie.  Also some characters are just shown in one scene, and in the next their true nature is suddenly revealed, with no development in between.  On the good side, I was particularly impressed with the musical fragments in the movie, absolutely beautiful, particularly the Bach one.  If I ever have the opportunity, I'll try to watch the first chapters of the series to get into it, instead of (or before) trying to follow this movie.

221803,"""Water is the life blood of every community.""  With this statement, the Los Angeles Department of Water and Power's website begins its biography of William Mulholland, the real life model of two of this movie's characters, water department chief Hollis Mulwray (an obvious play on words) and water tycoon Noah Cross.  And indeed water, the access to it and the wealth it provides, is what drives everything and everybody in this movie set in the ever-thirsty Los Angeles of the first decades of this century, a budding boom town on the brink of victory or decay ... and whether it will be one or th other depends on the city's ongoing access to drinking water.""Chinatown""'s story is based on William Mulholland's greatest coup; the construction of the Owen Valley aqueduct which provided Los Angeles with a steady source of drinking water but also entailed a lot of controversy.  Splitting Mulholland's complex real-life persona into two fictional characters (the noble Mulwray who thinks that water should belong to the people and who refuses to authorize an unsavory new dam construction project and the greedy, unscrupulous Cross who will use *any* means to advance his personal fortune) creates the movie's one necessary black and white conflict ... other than this, the predominant shades are those of gray.Into the wars raging around L.A.'s water supply, private eye Jake Gittes (Jack Nicholson) is unwittingly thrown when a woman introducing herself as Hollis Mulwray's wife asks him to investigate her husband's alleged infidelity.  Before he realizes what is going on he is drawn into a web of treachery and treason, and fatally attracted to the real Mrs. Mulwray (Faye Dunaway), Noah Cross (John Huston)'s daughter.  Soon reaching the conclusion that he has been used, he refuses to drop the investigation, and instead decides to dig his way to the source of the scheming he has witnessed - the classical film noir setup.To say that this movie is one of the best examples of the genre ever made is stating the obvious ... actually, it borders on being superfluous.  Few other films are as tightly acted, scripted and directed, from Jack Nicholson's dapper-dressed, dogged Jake Gittes, who like any good noir detective is not half as hard boiled as he would have us believe, to Faye Dunaway's seductive and sad Evelyn Mulray, John Huston's cold-blooded and corrupt Noah Cross, Roman Polanski's brooding direction and Robert Towne's award-winning screen play, so full of memorable lines and the classical noir gumshoe dialogue, yet far more than just a well-done copy.  And throughout it all, there that idea of Chinatown - that place where you do as little as possible, and where if you try to help someone, you're likely going to make double sure they're getting hurt.""Chinatown"" was Roman Polanski's return to Hollywood, five years after his wife (Sharon Tate) had been one of the victims of the Manson gang.  Polanski and Towne fought hard whether the movie should have a happy ending or not.  Polanski won, studio politics were favorable at the time, and the version we all know was produced.  Towne later admitted that Polanski had been right; and in fact, it is hard to imagine what kind of happy ending would have worked with the movie at all - too deep-rooted are the conflicts presented, none of which lends itself to an easy solution.  Unfortunately, being released the same year as ""The Godfather II"" robbed ""Chinatown"" much of the Academy Award attention it would have deserved; of 11 nominations (best movie, best actor - Jack Nicholson -, best actress - Faye Dunaway -, best director  Roman Polanski , best screenplay - Robert Towne -, best original score - Jerry Goldsmith -, best cinematography, and others), the movie only won the Oscar for Towne's screenplay.  Generations of fans, however, have long since recognized that ""Chinatown"" is a milestone in the history of the film noir and in the professional history of its participants, and one of Hollywood's finest hours.Also recommended:William Mulholland and the Rise of Los AngelesRaymond Chandler: Stories and Early Novels: Pulp Stories / The Big Sleep / Farewell, My Lovely / The High Window (Library of America)Complete Novels: Red Harvest, The Dain Curse, The Maltese Falcon, The Glass Key, and The Thin Man (Library of America #110)Crime Novels: American Noir of the 1930s and 40s: The Postman Always Rings Twice / They Shoot Horses, Don't They? / Thieves Like Us / The Big Clock / Nightmare ... / I Married a Dead Man (Library of America)The Bogart Collection (Casablanca/The Maltese Falcon/To Have and Have Not/The Big Sleep/The Treasure of the Sierra Madre)Double Indemnity (Universal Legacy Series)The Postman Always Rings TwiceL.A.

In fact, it is hard to think of many scenes more romantic than that one.  Add to that one of the most mismatched couples in the history of romance: she's a sheltered Cocker Spaniel from high society and he's a mutt literally from the wrong side of the tracks.  Actually the kids will be caught up in the adventure and it is the adults who will feel the tug on their heartstrings.  Barbara Luddy does the voice for Lady while Tramp is voiced by Larry Roberts; it was the only movie he ever &quot;did,&quot; but Luddy went on to do the voice of Kanga in Winnie-the-Pooh films.  Still, it is Peggy Lee who does all the canine vocal scene stealing in this Disney film (&quot;He's a Tramp).Most romantic line(s): The line of spaghetti between Lady and the Tramp, of course.Three Tear-Jerking Scenes: (1) the romantic dinner; (2) the rat attack; and (3) the heroic effort of Rusty.If you like &quot;Lady and the Tramp,&quot; then check out these other films on AFI's list: #34 &quot;Beauty and the Beast,&quot; #53 &quot;A Place in the Sun,&quot; and #17 &quot;Moonstruck.&quot;  Why?

201016,"Though there is much to admire here, this is not an entirely satisfactory retelling of the Dracula legend. The film suffers from a tendency to take itself far too seriously. Laurence Olivier, as Van Helsing, really hams it up with some utterly banal dialogue of the sort that simply cannot be uttered nowadays without tongue firmly in cheek, which has the effect of turning him into a delusional and laughable old man. The attempt to turn the Dracula story into a lavish, sumptuous, sweeping romantic-drama does not sit well with the risible script. What was needed was a less grave (pardon the pun) approach, which would have enabled the film's darker and more poignant aspects to have deeper impact.On the other hand, there are a few things about the movie that shine. Visually, the film harks back to the Hammer Dracula movies of the '50s and '60s. Even the woodlands in and around the castle could be the very same location at which most of Hammer's output was filmed. Langella's Dracula, as he is filmed walking swiftly along, his cloak flapping behind him, has more than a touch of Christopher Lee. At the same time, however, Langella has a character of his own as the dreaded Count, at once as charming and romantic as he is dastardly and terrifying. Dracula's demise is one of the most memorable in the history of Dracula movies: in his death throes he is a struggling animal, a demon fighting death to the last, even managing to elicit a certain degree of pathos in his attempts to resist the inevitable. For these excellent touches, this is worth viewing.",N/A

594785,"When I saw this movie I couldn't help but compare it to James Bond movies. Since Bond has pretty much set the stage for all spy movies, I wondered how this movie would stack up. Overall, I was impressed; Vin Diesel may be the secret agent for people ages 15-30 or so.The movie has all the necessary things you'd come to expect from a spy film: at least one special agent, at least one beautiful chick, fast cars, explosions, lots of gadgets, and a villan bent on taking over the world. While these things are pretty much standard issue in the spy film genre, they also weaken the movie a little.The action sequences are really what keeps the movie going. Xander Cage (Diesel) fits the role of an extreme sports athlete, and the opening sequence really sets the stage for the things he's willing to do. Everything is a trick to him, from the opening scene involving someone else's car and a bridge, to jumping out of an airplane and snowboarding down in front of an avalanche. These tricks move the storyline along better than dialog would do. Cage is an action man, not a man of words.The plot of the movie is what makes me give the movie 4 stars. It's one of your typical spy movie plots.  In this case the special agent isn't smooth and refined, instead of ordering martinis and talking about intellectual things, he drinks cranberry juice and tells people to ""stop thinking cop, start thinking Playstation and blow stuff up."" He shoots people with tranquilizer darts instead of bullets. However, this is the primary difference between this spy movie and most spy movie. There's still the beautiful woman caught up in all the trouble who falls for the agent, lots of nifty gadgets, and the evil villain. In this case the evil villain is a defector of the Russian army who heads a group that wants world anarchy.Overall, the movie is good, it's a nice change from the suave suit and tie agent we're accustomed to.  While the idea of an unlikely secret agent isn't new, people ages 15-30 can relate better to a guy with tattoos who hangs out with professional skaters and goes to clubs better than they can relate to a man who goes everywhere in a suit, drinks vodka martinis and seduces women without a second thought.  I really shouldn't compare this movie to the Bond ones, it stands on it's own as a respectable spy movie.",N/A
525577,"I'm afraid I'm not very positive about this film.  I could barely make it to the end.  As a student of film studies, I have to say that filmmakers today, especially Hollywood filmmakers, are tending more and more to rely on special effects and quick shots of people's expressions, and not enough on ACTING!  Even the great Maggie Smith was reduced to a series of melodramatic poses and shallow facial expressions.  And I was ready to tear that plasterboard fake smile off of Daniel Radcliffe's face by the end of the movie.  I'm afraid he, like the rest of the characters in this film, suffer from terminal cool.  I suppose thats what kids today want.  And you can bet Hollywood will deliver.The film is also excessively violent.  If you compare sections of the film with the way the story is told in the book, you can see the added amount of gratuitous violence.  Children and creatures are hurled around and smashed against things like they're images in a video game.  Realism?  Get real!The special effects on the DVD are so loud, I had to keep turning the volume down.  But then I couldn't hear the dialogue, so then I had to turn it up again.  Too much noise, too much violence, not enough genuine acting, sophisticated storytelling, and human interaction.  Period!",N/A
572474,"the acting is pretty bad. If it was better, this could have been a really scary film, but unfortunately the acting took away some of the films atmosphere, but it is still pretty spooky. Not a Friday the 13th rip-off, for one thing, instead of hormone driven teens, we have hormone driven 40 year olds, and that is frieghtening enough. It's kind of like The Fog, Texas Chainsaw Massacre, Halloween (sort of), and Friday the 13th. To get scared in this movie, you do have to take it seriously, and try not to crack jokes about it. If you do that, then I'mn sure this will be an experience you won't forget anytime soon. Watch this one alone in the dark. The extra features on the disc are pretty good, and I'm surprised because a film like this usually doesn't get very good extra features.

703520,"This is amongst the most quietly intense films one is ever likely to see. Forget about plot and storytelling. The attractions here are as un-Hollywood as one can get. It uses ,instead, the power of silent suggestion to evoke a response from the viewer. Each gesture, each look, each gaze displayed by the pricipal actors, is pregnant with meaning. I disagree with those who say that the film challenges your intellect. The performances, the cinamatography, the script, they are all geared towards eliciting an intuitive, not an intellectual response. The photography in this film is not often remarked upon, but I think each frame of the house interior is a perfectly composed picture of American domesticity. The visuals do not exist for their own sake; often they suggest emotional desolation and solitude. One particular technique simply blew me away: sometimes the screen fades into utter blackness, lasting just a little too long than is common in movies, which is a simple but effective way making us feel the emptiness the characters feel. The movie, then, is very much like a painting; it leaves a lot for your imagination, it suggests rather than shows, it demands complete attention.

379968,"What can be said of ""Re-Animator"" that hasn't been said before?  As horror movies go, it is a true classic, and a landmark in innovative effects even with budget restraints.  So, before I delve into the film itself, let me first start with the DVD:This is not the first edition of this movie availible for purchase from Elite Entertainment.  However, it is vastly superior to their previous version, which was, in itself, a triumph.  ""Re-Animator"" has been labeled as a ""Millenium Edition"" from Elite, which, for DVD fans, is very good news indeed.  Although Elite possesses (no pun intended) a fairly small library of titles, the releases from the studio have been impressive enough to rival even the cult-movie megapower that has become Anchor Bay.  Elite has brought the world the finest version of George A. Romero's ""Night of the Living Dead"" to ever hit shelves, as well as a version of ""The Evil Dead"" that, had it not been for the release of the ""Book of the Dead"" earlier last year, may have (and some would claim still is) just been THE definitive version of that movie.  Yet if these releases are just the icing on the cake (which they are), then ""Re-Animator"" is the candle on top.Boasting FOUR audio setups (including DTS 5.1 surround) and not one, but TWO commentaries(the second of which is highly entertaining and informative), as well as THX digital transfer, this movie could easily stand on it's own.  But that just wouldn't have been good enough, would it?  No, not for a ""Millenium"" release...So a second disk is included, and it holds some of the most interesting and informative supplements that I've ever seen.  While I won't get into too much detail, let me just say that the extended and deleted scenes alone are worth the cost of the DVD.  But there is sooooooo much more, most notably, an interview with Stuart Gordon, three multi-angle story boards, and some hilarious TV spots.  And I've only mentioned less than a fourth of all this disk has to offer!Now that I've clarified just how credible the DVD is, let me briefly discuss the movie.  The plot concerns a struggling medical student and his desire to create a serum that can ressurect dead tissue.  His misadventures get him in a heap of trouble that eventually leads up to a violent finale where the dead are ""re-animated"" and wage a war against the living in a hospital morgue.  This movie is not for all tastes.  It is filled with over-the-top gore and gratuitous sexuality,  you've most likely never heard of the majority of the actors, the movie was made on an obviously limited budget, and it was Brian Yuzna's directorial debut.  Now, replace some of the words I just said and you have the synopsis for just about every 80's B-horror movie ever made.  But where these movies failed, ""Re-Animator"" succeeds by having an extremely dedicated team of people devoted to the movie's well-bieng, a fantastic script by Dennis Paoli, and a sense of style that was lacking in so many films before the birth of ""Re-Animator"" and after it's eventual sucession into cult movie history.

I first saw it when I was 8 years old and it gave me nightmares. even 17 years later this movie still gives me spine-tingling sensations. Linda Blair (In her most known role) plays a 12 year old girl possessed by the devil himself. Her mother (Ellen Burstyn) takes her to every doctor imaginable and they have no prognosis on 12 year old reagan's condition. Believing that reagan is somehow possessed by a supernatural being she turns to father Damion Karros for an exorcism to release the demon from her 12 year old girl. This movie spawned two sequels but could never match the mystique or absolute horror of the original. The Exorcist is eerie, creepy and everything you've heard it to be.

328367,"""The Atomic Cafe"" is an example of Eisenstein's notion of montage on the macro level. Produced and directed by Jayne Loader, Kevin Rafferty and Pierce Rafferty, this film achieves it rhetorical potency simply by editing together old film and documentaries from the 1940's and 1950's. By putting a cartoon of Tommy the Turtle teaching school children to ""Duck and cover"" next to film of actual atomic bomb tests, ""The Atomic Cafe"" renders the Cold War both ludicrous and chilling at the same time. Without narration and by using a few choice songs, this documentary finds a surprising strong voice against the insanity of nuclear destruction.It is important to remember that by the end of the 1950's, and for quite some time after that, it was assumed that one day there would be World War III and that it was going to be an all-out nuclear war between the United States and the Soviet Union. ... The manner in which Americans cheerfully prepared for a nuclear war cannot help but seem patently absurd to us today, but these images are unforgettable. Still, you have to admire the spirit of American inventiveness that would come up with radiation suits and quickie shelters.""The Atomic Cafe"" manages to inform us about the mentality of the American people during that period of the Cold War, while harshly critiquing that view from our informed perspective of today. I have always been impressed by how this could be achieved simply by arranging the order in which we view these historic bits of film and adding a dramatic counterpoint through the use of music. Very simple but quite powerful. Final Note: be prepared for Hugh Beaumont (a.k.a. Ward Cleaver) to show up in a military training film to explain what happens when an atomic bomb goes off.",The Atomic Cafe VHS

No wonder they look so serene and plesant doing the work of the Dark Side.You know the story; if you don't, there are plenty of folks who have written good synopsises of it. This is strictly for people who want my 2 cents:Is this film better than Episode 1? Yes. We've taken care of all the introductions in the first film and can get down to business here. While I'm sure some liked the cutesy kids in the first film, I preferred all the main characters to be grown (the exception to this is of course Boba Fett; this kid has more talent than all the child actors in the first movie put together. I haven't seen such grim determination in a character since Omen 2).One of the problems, as I see it, is that Lucas seems to have forgotten how to tie his films together. This was somewhat apparent in Return of the Jedi, and has continued to get worse in the prequels. I know you might say it's the editors, but nothing leaves Skywalker Ranch without George's stamp of approval.The other is characters and the people hired to play them. When I took my wife to see the film, many of the audience laughed during the romance scenes. She wondered why. I explained that Christensen's acting was, to say the least, cheesy.Add to that the continued existence of Jar-Jar and I can't in all honesty say I really enjoyed this film. Except for when Samuel L. Jackson de-headified Jango. That was very cool.Finally, Mr. Lucas can explain away SW story/historical inconsistancies that he created saying it's not literal and thatthings will be explained later, but why? Where's the benefit to the audience? Some say I should be less critical since it's HIS film and we should be grateful for such an imagination. To this I say ...!!! He doesn't make these films just for himself, or he'd be doing it with a Super 8 anf have them on his den shelves, bringing them out on holidays when he has guests. He wants us to see his vision, but let's face it: it's ours now as well. He needs to respect that to a certain extent.3 stars is what I can honestly give this film.

After exhausting all the legal means at his disposal, John Q. takes over the hospital at gun-point and demands that his son be given a heart.  The script then begins to spiral into melodrama and it becomes somewhat preachy.

By finish, I felt ripped open, exposed, brutalized into feeling, into understanding how secluded we become from ourselves and from others when we isolate any part of our humanness. We are not to be intellect alone, however superior. We are not to be spirit alone, not body alone, but we are to be whole, even as we are in the process, no, most of all when we are in the process... of being broken down.Wit is filmed sparingly and beautifully. There is no excess. The focus is clear and it is never anywhere but where it should be; every detail is in place for a purpose. John Donne's poetry is the perfect encasement to this story of life and death - and the metaphor of life as a comma, a pause, a mere breath away from death, is sharp and true. No less perfect - Margaret Wise Brown's ""The Runaway Bunny."" Run, if you will, but your humanity will finally find you.The best movie I have ever viewed? Can it be? To date - it is. And Thompson's performance, even as I wince to downgrade it by calling it a ""performance,"" even as I wince at such superlatives, is the most impressive I have ever seen. Bravo.",Wit

352672,"Today's kids, raised on computer-generated graphics, will probably sneer at it, but by 1957 standards THE LAND UNKNOWN was pretty hard to beat.  Drawing inspiration from 1920s silent classic THE LOST WORLD and using film shot by Byrd during his polar expedition, THE LAND UNKNOWN presents the story of a helicopter forced down at a warm-water oasis in Antartica--where the crew discovers a prehistoric world where everything seems determined to gobble them up.The special effects are a mixed bag, ranging from live-action shots of lizards-in-combat to Godzilla-style rubber suits to full size mechanics.  While I wouldn't describe it as greatly sophistocated or even consistently executed, it is all a tremendous amount of fun.  The script is more intelligent than you might expect--and the story takes an unexpected turn that tempers the action-heavy plot with a certain depth.  The cast is no-name, but every one plays expertly, and THE LAND UNKNOWN moves at a cracking pace.  This will never compete with the likes of Harryhausen's stop-motion classics, nor will it go down in the history of film as an equal to the truly great science-fiction and fantasy films of its day.  But THE LAND UNKNOWN is a fun flick, and I recommend it to fans of 1950s creature features.",Land of the Unknown VHS
496937,"If you are interested in the substance abuse genre, this movie is the most realistic, powerful, and disturbing I've seen.  Compare this to the likes of ""Days of Wine and Roses"", ""The Man With the Golden Arm"" and ""28 Days"", and the others all seem lame and glossed over.  The only film that I thought came close to the level of realism of ""Chrstiane F."" was ""Panic in Needle Park"".This film takes you to the horrifying depths of heroin addiction, as excruciatingly experienced by a German teenager and her ""friends"".  Based on a true story from the 1970's Berlin drug scene, the title character is from a dysfuntional family who eventually falls into the grips of heroin addiction and prostitution by age 14.  Great soundtrack, with Bowie (I especially liked the version of Heroes that is sung partly in German), great depiction of the 70's club scene in Berlin, which was rampant with drug use.  Even though in color, has the gritty feel of a noir.  The film also captures dead-on the desperation of addiction, and how the addicts life becomes all about the next shot.  The film also does a great job of conveying the depravity and desolation of the Berlin Zoo train station, a haven for prostitues and addicts at the time.Based on a book of the same name (unfortunately, last I checked, the book was out of print), the movie of course does not go into as much detail (what movie based on a book does?) but nonetheless, this is a brutal, accurate portrait of the ravages of drug use.Two things, if you can find the book, buy it.  The book was riveting and goes into much greater depth of the girls family background, and her early drug use pre-heroin addiction.  Also the movie condenses her many ""cold turkey"" episodes into one or two instances, and the true horror of her withdrawals are much more graphic and real in the book.Secondly, I would have given this 5 stars if the movie were subtitled instead of dubbed.  It takes a lot away from the film, and I would recommend waiting until it is released (hopefully) in German with subtitles.  I was fortunate enough to have seen the film in the theatre in German with subtitles, and it made a big difference.A classic movie of this genre, a must see, even with the dubbing!",N/A

How many drafts?  How concretewere your concepts when you wrote it?  Is there any excised materialI can look at?I can think of no other movie that has as many great speechesas this one.  You rarely ever get more than one a film (there's somekind of unwritten rule about that, I think):  Brando's ""I Coulda BeenA Contender"" speech from `On The Waterfront'; Duke Wayne's trail drivespeech from `Red River';  any Bogart film.Here I count no less than four.Two are made by the character of Harold Beale on the air,summarizing for anyone who can stomach to listen the precise cost oftelevision in our lives and upon our souls.  Another is by Max Shumacherto his cynical, destructive TV producer lady love.  It's the sort oflong personal tirade that's impossible to pull off in real life, butthat doesn't stop us from trying).  The fourth speech is the mostdevastating of the lot.  It's the ""personal cosmology of David Jensen""as recited by Ned Beatty.  Consider it a primer of sorts for becomingseriously interested in giving up all hope about humanity's ability toadvance itself fundamentally.You think it's easy to write this kind of movie?  Ask David Mamet,Warren Beatty, Spike Lee, and countless other filmmakers, many of whomhave tried their hands at this sort of material with varying degreesof success.  Mamet came off best, I think, with the passable `Wag TheDog,' but even that film was curiously lifeless and very broad.Beatty's `Bullworth' and Lee's `Bamboozled' missed more widely.

440421,"There are elements of the movie that left me a little bothered.  Foremost was the subtitles (the Japanese actors speak their own language rather than English) were white which oftentimes appeared with a white background (the navy uniforms).  This was frustrating when trying to really follow the story.  Another element was the constant change of location and players, which made it difficult to keep up with who knew what and when.In retrospect, these elements contributed to my enjoyment of the film.  Although the scenes of the Pearl Harbor attack were horrific, the bulk of the film concerns the events leading up to that fateful day.  The seemingly haphazardness of this film helped me feel the chaos and miscommunication occurring on both sides of the battlefield.  All the mistakes made by both sides show lessons to be learned; for example, the ignoring of the new radar contact showing a large mass approaching Hawaii, the delay by requesting for confirmation on the sinking of Japanese submarine close to Pearl Harbor, and wish to not alarm the high-ranking officials.I found this to be a great film, but if you do not have a good idea of who the players and events were at Pearl Harbor in 1941, you may find yourself lost.",N/A

232922,"Talking about collisions of good and bad?  ""Mame"" takes the cake.First on my (and, it seems, everyone's agenda) is Lucille Ball.  OK.  I can't say that they should've picked a different Mame, because ""they"" couldn't.  As another reviewer pointed out, Lucy bought the rights to this terribley fuzzy and joke of a movie.  Lucy.  Let's look at the facts on Lucy.  Lucille Ball is known around the world as a wonderfully exuberent and bite the bullet TV comedien.  So what is she doing playing this witty and glamorous aunt?  Not to mention that her singing could never make it on any stage (as I'm sure they jacked up the mikes for 62 year old Miss Ball).And the porker they have playing Patrick (who by the way cannot sing a note) is not in any essence an open and exuberent Patrick Dennis, except for his blonde locks.And let's talk ceoreography.  Onna White originally ceoreographed the 1966 stage version of ""Mame"" and I'm sure he had a lot more to work with.  I'm sure he had to work around Lucy's bad hips, but it's been done before.  So why does this dancing stink?  In Sweet Charity and Cabaret there's a dazzling amount of wonderful and original dancing.  So why didn't this work for Mame?  Yes, the dancers do a witty little butt slap and a basic charelston move.  But please.  Lucille could've at least had a decent Hollywood ceoreographer do the job.And the costumes might be wonderful, but not Mame.  Where are the ostrich feathers and the diamonds.  The costumer even sticks Mame in a melencholy and plain black mourning gown during ""Open a New Window""Musical numbers?  Joke.  They haxed the wonderful loud instruments, and cut the lovely instrumental solo music for a slow and soft elevator soundtrack.Those are the out standing bads, leaving out so many.  All in all this movie is what many reviewers would call it horrible, but let's look at the few nice things about this apalling movie.First, the betrayel of Agnes Gooch is done ""cute"" by the original actress who had the part in 1966.  But she really can't compare to what Madeline Kahn (my favorite film comedianess) could've done with the role (our dear Madeline was hauked by Miss Ball.  I wonder why?).  Believe it or not this cute Agnes was one of the goods.But basically the only remotely good thing about this movie is the wonderfully funny potrayel of Mame's best friend, a stage vamp, by Miss Bea Arthur.  Her hillarious alcoholic and snobbish spoofing across the screen is one not to be missed (but wait for this movie to be on TV before you see it, because what moron would spend decent money on this)?This version of the escapades of Auntie Mame Dennis makes me ask, where's the outrageosness, where's the bohemian qualities, and most of all, where's Angela Lansbury?Surprisingly enough, this terrible film is actually taken from a superbly and glamorously written book under the title Auntie Mame, which has a fabulous film version starring the enchanting Rosalind Russel.Read the book and see the movie ""Auntie Mame"" but don't waste your eye ball juice on seeing ""Mame"".",Mame VHS

179159,"The late great classic acting talents of Robert Mitchum are showcased in this 1962 classic, reproving his ability to play the villain with unsurpassed expertise, as in the former 1955 classic ""Night of The Hunter"".Here, Mitchum plays Max Cady, a menacing figure with a perpetual lit cigar and Panama Hat.  He has come to town after being released from jail to visit and wreak revenge on the man who put him there, enter Sam, played by Gregory Peck.  From their initial reunion in the town parking lot, Cady lets Peck have a peek at what's on his mind.  From that moment on, there are grippingly suspenseful encounters between the two men and even worse, threats to his wife played by Polly Bergen, and his daughter, in a rather ineffectual role considering what she goes through when encountering Cady.  Particularly amusing is a scene in the beginning of the film.  Cady casually watches the family bowl, while harrassing a waitress and having a beer.  The expression on Pecks face as his Sam character looks up, and spots those sinister leering eyes peering from a nearby table at his family, is classic.What needs to be mentioned more than the great direction, pacing and script, is the believabilty of the sociopath depicted, that Mitchum brings to startling low-life on the screen.  He is truly mesmerizing in his sleepy-eyed evil countenance.  His gaze, cigar in mouth, hat pulled low, will raise your hair as you watch him.  He moves toward his victims in a slow and deliberate manner, and speaks his lines with that commanding voice that he was so famous for.  When picked up for questioning, he hilariously mocks Pecks' Sam, calling him casually by name, ""Why, Say-im..."" and then as ""counselor"" refering to his lawyer status.  My favorite Mitchum line here?""You might want to look closer, I've got a few jolts of horse stashed under the collar."" as he hands over his shirt to the police.  The other great line is to Peck in a bar, as he lets him know that he can't be bought off.  When speaking of his dear ex-wife, ""Pumped a quart of whiskey in her, tore off her dress, threw away her shoes, and gave her a fair chance to work her way home..."" Needless to say, pretty daring for it's time.  You will have to find out the rest for yourself, like the scene with the drifter girl Mitchum picks up, and of course, the showdown.Don't even think that Martin Scorcese's subsequent remake comes close to this classic.  The excessively demented southern accent and preponderance of large tattoo's on DeNiro,  don't make him more frightening than Mitchums' original take on the Max Cady character.  Mitchum's subtle style of menacing, which seems paradoxical, but works, is far more effective at eliciting the viewers rapt attention.  Besides, the Scorcese version got mired in outside subjects like infidelity from Nick Noltes version of Sam, what for?  Let's face it, the original doesn't need  any additional subplots to be entertaining.""Cape Fear"" is a strange title, refering to the very real location of the story, while it also serves as a perfect double entendre for the utter fright Robert Mitchum delivers within, in an unparalleled style.

519211,"_Fight Club_ is not the movie you might think from the trailers and previews. It *is* a movie about a lot of the stuff that often makes American Society of the late 20th century so brutally depressing and unfulfilling, particularly from the point of view of lower working-class men. As such, it has a lot of interesting things to say about bonding, identity and social standards. Because of this, I found the first half of the movie absorbing and witty in a dark kind of way, full of grim humour and cutting observations. After that, however, it really lost its grip on me.The narrator (Edward Norton) is a literally anonymous corporate drone whose only pleasure in life is ordering kitchsy items from catalogues.  A period of insomnia sends him in search of emotional catharsis at various support groups for the terminally ill where he meets Myra (Helena Bonham Carter), another ""voyeur.""  Shortly thereafter, he meets travelling soap salesman Tyler Durden (Brad Pitt), a virtual human phrasebook of ""radical"" thought and recipes for making explosives from household products.  The two men discover the dubious transcendent experience of pummelling each other into oblivion and decide that this is what's missing from men's lives.  Thus the Fight Club is born.And that's where the movie lost me.  From that point onward, the cutting, and often humourous, observations about society were too much replaced by scenes of bare-chested men knocking each other about interspersed with Tyler Durden's pseudo-anarchistic dogma.  For someone who's never thought much about society's self-sustaining and materialistic hierarchy, Durden's observations might sound enlightened, but for me it got old really fast.  After about fifteen minutes, I felt as bludgeoned as the men in the club and it was all I could do not to turn the movie off.I was also disappointed in the way the Fight Club itself mutated from a place for men to find themselves and discover their power (however dubiously) into a kind of miltary organization that dehumanized the participants every bit as much as the society they were trying to combat.  Although this is pretty standard cult development, I found it depressing.  I look for movies of this sort to push the boundaries in new and different ways and offer new ideas, if not solutions.  _Fight Club_ didn't do that. It fell back on the same old revolutionary script and became just another movie about guys blowing things up while becoming the thing that they hate.  Was that the point?  I didn't know, and I got the impression that the movie didn't know, either.  It left me with a real feeling of futility.The acting is actually quite good, and a _Sixth Sense_ type plot twist towards the end goes a long way towards redeeming the middle portions of the film but doesn't quite manage it. _Fight Club_ is probably a good movie to see if you're feeling angry with the world and need to have your anger validated.

The rest of the cast is stranded as the editor and director cut short any non-verbal moments that might have resonated. Ellen Burstyn and Maggie Smith manage to grab a few good moments, but not often enough to save this poorly scripted, predictable, overly melodramatic film from being very entertaining to women who read the book.Of course maybe the fact they got the book made into a movie and Callie (Thelma and Louise) Khorie got another paycheck is reason to rejoice.

594917,"I saw Signs yesterday at the theater with my mother and we both left feeling a bit dissapointed and confused. The movie which is supposed to be about a man (played by Mel Gibson) who's family is being left with these out of world ""signs"", is actually a drama about an ex reverend / preist (???) who's lost all faith in God as well as control of his family. The loss of his wife seems to have left this man a bitter, faithless and cynical person who's only keeping it together with the help of his little brother (played by the enormously talented Joaquin Phoenix). The signs and his lack of faith and his past seem to weave together leading the audience to believe that there will be some great touching climax that explains it all. Sadly, there is not. In fact, many of the questions in the film are left unanswered and some things were just down right stupid. Example: He calls himself a reverend, but the people in his town treat him like a preist asking if he'll listen to their confessions and calling him father. I find this to be terribly disturbing since the heart of the story obviously has nothing to do with aliens or signs, but is about a man's faith and his family. Many times (mostly towards the end) there are scenes that try to be scary, touching and inspiring all at once and it's about this time in the movie where you realize that the film's great set up was all for nothing. M. Night Shyamalan has been very successful with past films making you think the story was going one way and then revealing secrets and twists to turn the story upside down. In past films it worked. This time, it has not. What was meant to be a story about signs from another planet is neither thought provoking or scary. The only thrills come from the tension built by the incredible actors, an eerie setting and a great score. The real story is about a faithless man losing control of his life and if M. Night had followed through with the story that he had been building, this would have been an excellant movie. Too bad for us he sells out in the end and ends up confusing the audience. By the time the film was over, the tears that were being shed by those around me who were hoping to see a triumphant and satisfying conclusion were quickly replaced by frowns and puzzled faces; the most clear sign of the entire experience.",Signs

Among animation fans, few would dispute the fact that the Fleischer brothers were creative geniuses whose innovative techniques are admired to this day.But the sound on this DVD does these great works a terrible injustice. The sound on Aladdin has been reworked with ""improved"" sound effects, to the detriment of the original dialog and music. I had to shut off surround and turn the treble down to minus 12db on my receiver just to make the added sound bearable! At one point, after Popeye (Aladdin) has been transformed into a prince, he's riding into the city on his great, white steed, and singing a song. But all through the song all I could hear was a loud ""clop, clop, clop"" that was, I presume, supposed to be the sound of horses hooves on pavement, but sounded like nothing less than Monty Python and the Holy Grail's ""banging two coconuts together."" The added or ""enhanced"" sound effects on Aladdin were more than distracting, they were overwhelming!The rest of the cartoon shorts are a bit better, and the newsreel is an interesting bit of history.I don't know. All in all I suppose I am happy to have these in some form, but I'd pay several times as much for decently restored (and properly respected) disk of these same cartoons. Hopefully, someone will come along in the not too distant future with a definitive restored collection of the classic Fleischer Studios Popeye cartoons and put them on DVD.This is NOT that DVD. Buy it if you must, but be prepared to tear your hair out all through Aladdin (at least) as you strain to hear the wonderful dialog . . . because it's THAT BAD.",N/A

Nevertheless, I think it's just about one of the funniest movies I've ever seen.  My wife and I laugh helplessly whenever we see it.

267270,"Vaguely based on the life of Bill &quot;Bojangles&quot; Robinson himself, STORMY WEATHER offers the story of a WWI vet who falls in love with a singer--and under her influence goes into show business, only to find that their careers draw them in different directions.  As a story, it is pretty slim stuff... but as a collection of musical turns by some of the early 1940s best black talent, it simply can't be beat.Robinson was, of course, one of the truly great dancers of his era.  Made late in his career, this film doesn't really manage to capture the scope of his talents, but he remains a constant joy to watch.  A very young and remarkably beautiful Lena Horne also offers several enjoyable songs, including one that she would go on to perform with increasing sophistocation and ultimately make entirely her own: the title tune &quot;Stormy Weather.&quot;  In addition to Calloway and Horne, STORMY WEATHER offers great performances by such under-filmed artists as Cab Calloway, Katherine Dunham, Fats Waller (performing his signature tune, &quot;Ain't Misbehaving&quot;), the brillant Nicholas Brothers, and Ada Brown, as well as the popular comic actor Dooley  Wilson.  Expect nothing from the story, but you won't be disappointed by this rare glimpse at some truly remarkable talents.",Stormy Weather VHS

719552,"Hot on the heels of ""Ginger Snaps"" is another non-US werewolf film that does an excellent job of showing horror, tongue-in-cheek humor, and reverant nods to other movies it borrows from.Sure, it's filled with cliche, but done very well.  The premise, in a nutshell, is that a small squad of British soldiers are dropped into the Scottish Highlands on wargames -- on the eve of an important soccer match against Germany (important at the end with the newspaper mockup, and because one of the men, ""Joe,"" is really into soccer).All seems well initially, until a dead (cow?  deer?  not sure) animal falls onto their campfire.  The interest of the squad leader (Pertwee) triggered, he leads his men to investigate, coming across the very bloody remains of their opposition in the wargames, the Special Forces unit.They find a survivor, babbling ""there was only supposed to be ONE!""  Taking him with them (and co-opting the weapons with REAL ammo, the squad's were filled with blanks), the squad is beset by werewolves (which we don't see fully-lit until later).  One death and a maiming later, the survivors run into Megan (Emma Cleasby), who takes them to the ""safety"" of a neighbor's house.So, we have soldiers with limited ammunition, monsters trying to get in, and more secrets yet to be revealed.""Dog Soldiers"" may have been shot on a budget, but it was an enjoyable romp for anyone who loves werewolf movies.Lots of gore (those who've seen the movie will understand my review title), but none of it gratuitous.

Perhaps it's because I'm from the South but watching this particular movie is like watching a home movie, I know these women! Steel Magnolias is truly a slice of life, full of laughter, tears, frustrations, change, loss and joy!And just when I thought the movie couldn't get any better, the DVD version became available. The deleted scenes and other tidbits are nice but the overwhelming reason to buy this version of the film is for the interview with the author. I was floored to learn that Steel Magnolias is a 'real life' story which only makes every scene in this already powerful movie that much more meaningful.If you've never seen Steel Magnolias don't just rent it, buy it!

And of course, Anthony Hopkins plays Hannibal Lecter as he always does, which is brilliantly.  Thanks to Silence of the Lambs, these types of murder mysteries are my favorite type of movie.  I don't want to give the plot away, but I will say that the movie is worth the price of admission and much more.

701150,"There is something to be said about PANIC ROOM, an intense thriller along the lines of STRAW DOGS and WAIT UNTIL DARK: It is an extraordinarily claustrophobic film.  But that's the beauty of films like these, because it forces us to imagine what we would do if, like the mother and daughter (Jodie Foster, Kristin Stewart) in this film, we were in that kind of a position.The pair find themselves at the mercy of deranged burglars (Jared Leto, Forrest Whittaker, Dwight Yoakam) looking for a stash worth millions in Foster's new Manhattan townhouse.  Foster and Stewart barricade themselves in a ""panic room"", complete with TV monitors and emergency supplies.  It is a regular 21st century fallout shelter of sorts.  Unfortunately for them, it is also where the crooks want to get into.Except for the excess of profanity in the screenplay, writer David Koepp (JURASSIC PARK, MISSION IMPOSSIBLE) and director David Fincher (SEVEN) are able to keep the tension extraordinarily palpable throughout.  In a very good cinematic ploy, the story is set entirely during one single rainy night and early morning.  Certain moments are very hair-raising.  Foster is, not surprisingly, really good; and Whittaker makes for a convincing heavy who nevertheless seems to allow for some audience sympathy at times, while his two friends go off on psychotic rages.An extremely good ""house under siege"" suspense item, PANIC ROOM is one of the best films of 2002.",N/A
521989,"Although I am a big fan of Japanese Animation, one doesn't have to be to enjoy Princess Mononoke (also known a Mononoke Hime). There is certainly a reason why this film is Japan's top grossing film ever, not just animated film, film period.Mononoke has a fabulous story line, set in Fuedal Japan, this movie is primarily about the struggle between nature and man in an industrialising world. It doesn't limit itself to that though, another main theme is dealing with conflicts and hatred. I really respected the way that the characters were represented. Since I consider myself close to nature, I naturally felt more sympathy for San (who is the Princess Mononoke), and the forest gods. However, her enemy, Lady Eboshi, was by no means an evil character, and was very good to people, such as the lepers that she cared for. This emphisised that there is no firm line between good and evil, and theme that I always like to see in movies.The animation of the characters, and especially the sceney was incredible. No animated movie has ever posessed such quality in my opinion, Disney and other american companies pale greatly in comparrison.I have shown this movie to many of my friends, most all of whom are not fans of animated movies, and not one has thought it anythign but spectacular. This film is not only one of the greatest animated movies of all time, or one of the greatest foreign movies of all time, it is possibly the greatest film of any kind, ever.",Princess Mononoke
705285,"No, ""Farscape"" is not yet being put into full season sets, but this is a vast improvement. As the plan goes now, a new 2-disc set will be released each month, with 4-5 episodes on each. And that's much better than only 2 episodes, every few months, as we've previously been getting.""Farscape"" is, bar none, the best science-fiction on TV. It's daring, bold, insane, whimsical, scary, and fun...and also has one of the most complex, involving, and brilliant mythologies of any sci-fi out there, including some fascinating stuff about wormholes.With that said, on to the episode reviews...""Mind the Baby"" is an excellent season-opener that picks up from the season finale with a punch, and leads the show into its new direction for the new year. Its only weakness is the fact that it was not originally meant to be the season-opener, but the second episode. The first one was aired later in the season, and turned into a flashback episode, where we find out what happened. Therefore, some of the aspects of the previous season finale cliffhanger are strangely resolved without an explanation...Although that explanation will be given later in the season, in the episode, ""Dream a Little Dream.""The next 2 episodes, unfortunately, are not the best ""Farscape"" has to offer. ""Taking the Stone"" and ""Vitas Mortis"" are both rather slow, unexciting episodes. Although each focuses on a different character and provides some great, sometimes crucial, character development, the actual stories don't pack the right amount of punch. That is not to say that they are not worth watching. Just they are not as good as they should have been.The fourth episode of the set, however, is the crown jewel of the 4, and completely makes up for the minor weaknesses of ""Mind the Baby"" and the more serious ones of the other two. ""Crackers Don't Matter"" is an utterly brilliant, demented, hilarious, black comedy that strikes a perfect balance between the dark and the funny. It is one of the best episodes the show has ever done. It's impossible to describe the episode without giving it away, but, suffice it to say, it is brillant on every level: character-wise, plot-wise, comedy-wise, drama-wise...Very few shows can produce an episode that can make you laugh till it hurts, and cringe, also. It also greatly benefits from being an episode with a stand-alone plot which also speaks a great deal aobut the characters, and foreshadows the major story arc of the year, something that won't come completely into focus and be fully revealed until much later in the year, in the ingenious ""Won't Get Fooled Again,"" which will take away its crown as the best episode up to that point.What is great about ""Farscape"" is how it always manages to top itself. Therefore, ""Crackers Don't Matter"" was the best episode for a while, until ""Won't Get Fooled Again"" took its place, which was then taken by the season finale, ""Die Me Dichotomy."" And that doesn't even factor in the two brilliant trilogies: ""Look at the Princess"" and ""Liars, Guns, and Money."" Wow, you people who have never seen this season before are in for a real treat...!!!",N/A
78800,"There is no way to deny it (and why would you?): The Lion King is animation at it's finest. The sequal, however, is no more then an attempt to cash in on the good version.Start at the beginning. The Lion King had one of the strongest openings I have ever seen, a magnificant score over an epic sweep, as Simba is proclaimed king.Simba's Pride steals a song from the Broadway musical.It's a nice song, but it's hardly strong enough to pull you in. Then, they actually have Timon and Pumba talk before the title screen. The Lion King, by contrast, had the title screen appear the second the song climaxed.The problem is, ""They Live in You"" doesn't climax; it fades.To be fair to the song, neither does the movie. There is sort of a zenophobic feel to parts, as Simba and Zazu talk about the ""Outsiders"" that were banished for unknown crimes. They are loyal to Scar, although why is never stated; perhaps because he never kicked them out. Lead by Scar's mate, they groom her son, Kovu (although, to be clear, he is not Scar's son, so no incest is going) to kill Simba and take his place. But he becomeas good, falls in love, yada yada yada, movies over.The music has some decent parts, but nothing on par with ""I Just Can't Wait to be King"", the weakest (in my veiw) song of the Lion King. And the background score is in the shadow of the majesty of the Lion King. There are only a few parts with choral voices as music-another minus, as singing under a scene is a universal good.Honsetly? If you didn't like the Lion King, there's nothing here for you. If you did, and you've seen it fifteen times, watch it again. There's stil nothing here for you that the original doesn't have ten times over.",N/A

681975,"After sitting through the entire film (which felt longer than the stated running time), it's hard to understand what all the fuss is about - both good and bad. This is a mediocre film built on a hackneyed, hole-ridden plot, shallow characterizations, and editing that strives for and fails to achieve true stylishness.The acting is good enough to keep the viewer from being taken `outside' the film, and suggests that, given better writers and directors, Carey could have ended up in a film that garnered more positive response. Much of animosity towards this film seems to be a reflection of viewers' animosity towards Carey herself. Her unhinged personal life and the headlines it's generated have translated into a great deal of personal contempt for her and her work.Those expecting a movie that's so bad that it's campy good fun will have to look to masterworks like ""Showgirls.""

The best thing about this DVD is that it gets right to the point; it has a modern-day intro by Mr. Williams himself, then segues immediately into the clips (which also make up the DVD's menu of scenes)- and captions everything, from guest star name to airdate and year. Look for the *4* Osmond brothers (sans Donny, but with baby Marie); Pearl Bailey at her most diva; Carlos Jobim performing &quot;Girl From Ipanema&quot; in Spanish [with Mr. Williams doing so in English]; a &quot;clown makeup&quot; fight with Judy Garland; a marvelous duet with Ella Fitzgerald; and a marvelous 'triplet' with Eddie Fisher and Bobby Darin.

501895,"A 1968 production, &quot;The Charge of the Light Brigade&quot; is both epic, and odd.Made during the twilight of the epic film (when the studios were finally starting to realize they were going to lose the audience wars with television), this is a unique film that does not in any way say &quot;Hollywood&quot;.The picture is a British affair, and very anti-war. Much time is devoted to showing the pomposity and ignorance of the ruling class, who think that war is a wonderful enterprise full of glory and honor. More thought is given to not ruffling the feathers of political allies than it is to drawing up battle plans.The film has a very strange atmosphere. It's part documentary, part soap opera, part auteur classic. The film has a hint of Peter Greenaway's work about it, with odd character interaction, and a strange voyeuristic feel. On top of that, there are odd animated segments sprinkled throughout the picture that express the patriotic fervor and thinking of the day. Now, all that may sound like a negative criticism, but the film, despite the stranger elements on display, is very compelling, and seems to be very accurate in regards to the events and atittudes of the men involved.The highlight of the film is, of course, the Charge of the Light Brigade against heavily fortified Russian positions. The ignorance and incompetence of the commanders still persists even in the face of tragic disaster. The film is a very strong dissertation on the stupidity and the cause and effect of war, using the famous Crimean battle as a foundation.And the charge itself?

470048,"Pushing Tin is a slang term used by air traffic controllers. It refers to moving all those commercial jetliners around the sky as they prepare for landing. It's well know that this is a high stress job. I would never consider it. I got stressed out just watching the controllers in Pushing Tin doing their jobs, and they were only actors. I have a hard enough time ""landing"" my car in our garage without taking out the trash cans.To enjoy this movie, you have to understand that it is a comedy. Even knowing that, the humor will prove too dry or sophisticated for some viewers' tastes. John Cusack plays Nick Falzone, a decent, dedicated guy who has been working in the air traffic control profession for fifteen years. His wife, Connie [Kate Blanchett], not only adores him, she understands how much pressure his job puts on him. Despite his attempts to maintain an even keel, it is obvious by watching him and his coworkers at work and play, that the balance is precarious at best. One day a new employee arrives. Russell Bell [Billy Bob Thornton] is a quiet, eccentric guy, who has never fit in anywhere a day in his life. He also has a work style that is unnerving to the other employees, especially Nick. Russell is much faster and more aggressive in lining up those big hunks of tin in the sky. This causes fiction between Nick and Russell, and soon a great competition ensues. The battle spill out of the workplace when Nick unwittingly gets too close to Russell's beautiful wife, Mary [Angelina Jolie]. Russell will prove to be the catalyst that sends Nick over the edge.There are scenes in Pushing Tin that are quite funny. There are others that are intense, especially the ones in which the possibility of a midair collision is real. Parts of it seem authentic. We see just how much power a controller has. A pilot has little choice but to fly his plane just as the controller instructs him to. Passengers are happily unaware that, in the landing procedure, the pilot isn't flying the craft. Someone on the ground is.The stars are all first-rate professionals. John Cusack has lit up the screen in independent classics such as The Grifters and The Player, as well as in big budget films like Midnight in the Garden of Good and Evil. Billy Bob Thornton is on my short list of best actors working today. Cate Blanchett won an Oscar nomination for Elizabeth, and Angelina Jolie is an up and coming young actress. They try, but fail to overcome a script problem that is the movie's biggest weakness. Nick and Connie are finely drawn characters, but we never really get to know Russell and Mary, who are essential to the story. We know they are crazy, but, since their presence has such an impact on the other couple, it would be good to know why they behave the way they do. We are left in the dark, and this simply is not good writing. Pushing Tin fails in the character development area. Because of this, the film ends up being lightweight, rather than simply light.",Pushing Tin VHS
251923,"I first saw this film at the movies when I was in my late 20s. It reminded me so much of my own summer after HS graduation, I went back to the theater to see it the very next day (dragging 2 friends along)!The script and direction are perfect, and this was deservedly Cusack's breakout role.  This movie rises miles above the typical ""teen flick"" to deliver rich, three dimensional characters who are funny and heartbreaking at the same time.Besides Cusack, the standout performance in this film belongs to Lili Taylor. Any female who suffered through the pangs of teenage first love can relate to her hilarious, endlessly morose songs about Joe.Lloyd Dobler is the guy that every girl wishes she had met when she was 17.  Ione Skye is appropriate beautiful, but her performance seemed a little wooden to me. I also was less than thrilled with John Mahoney's portrayal of the father - a little too broad and two dimensional, I would have liked to see a more subtle actor in this part.  (Harry Dean Stanton's performance as the dad in ""Pretty in Pink"" comes to mind)But those are minor complaints.  Cusack's performance and Crowe's vision are a combination for the ages.  Even all these years later, the film is not dated, and I still love it. I'm so glad it's finally on DVD and can't wait to check out the ""extras.""",Say Anything VHS
590043,"Gosford Park seemed like the type of movie that I would really enjoy. A murder mystery set in the 1930's. Kind of like Clue but with a bigger budget and less comedy. Unfortunately, I found myself falling asleep because I had no clue what was going on. I honestly know no more about the movie now than I did before I watched it. If you were to ask me what the movie was about, I would say some people came to a big house, someone was murdered, the people left. And you do not have to worry about me spoiling the ending because I do not know who the killer was. I understood that several characters had motives, but I did not understand why. I am not sure if the murderer was revealed or if he or she was not intended to be revealed.Here were my main difficulties with the movie. First, most of the characters had thick British accents and the sound was not done well at all. There was always too much background noise. Therefore, even if I could hear the dialogue, I could not understand it. Second, there were too many characters and the movie kept jumping from one to another very quickly, so I had no idea who was who and how they were related to the other characters.These difficulties left me watching the end credits rolling with disbelief. The movie just seemed to end, leaving no closure. I can only assume that this is the type of movie that you need to watch at least a couple of times in order to completely understand it. I rented this movie so I really do not have much motivation to spend the time or the money to watch it again.",N/A

283063,"THE MALTESE FALCON is my favorite detective movie of all time. It is considered a classic today because so many different facets of the film's making seem to have come together magically in this one production.John Huston was a screenwriter who wanted to remake the old MALTESE FALCON as his first film as a director. He not only did a superb job in his directing debut but also acted as screenwriter.The selection of Sydney Greenstreet to fill the role of Kaspar Gutman at age 61 after specializing in playing butlers on Broadway was another fortunate choice. Greenstreet had no previous Hollywood experience.The most important decision of all was probably to cast Humphrey Bogart as Sam Spade after George Raft had turned down the offer. It helped that the film had an all-star array of actors to complement Bogart. It would be difficult to find more suitable picks than Mary Astor, Gladys George, Peter Lorre, Barton MacLane, Lee Patrick, Ward Bond and Elisha Cook, Jr. Even a mere cameo appearance by Walter Huston resulted in an unforgettable scene. The director's father portrayed the dying Captain Jacobi of the La Paloma delivering the Falcon to Spade's office.THE MALTESE FALCON is certainly not a love story in the style of CASABLANCA. The Bogart characters in both films, however, strike me as being quite similar. I see them both as ordinary men who rise to heroic heights by sticking to a few basic rules of decency - in spite of their many human failings.I highly recommend THE MALTESE FALCON and am sure that I will no doubt see it again - and again.",N/A
589194,"If you received an Amazon.com gift certificate for the holidays and you're cruising through DVDs you might like to own, or if like me you saw 'Vanilla Sky' in the theater and believe you might enjoy it a second (or third, etc) time, go ahead, purchase a copy.  No matter how you view(ed) it, you need to watch this film more than one time.I read a well-known film critic's review of this film before I saw it the weekend it opened in theaters.  The gist of the review was; you have to see it twice to understand it.  I saw it once, enjoyed it thoroughly and left the theater thinking; well, I understood it the first time, that was pretty good.  I also knew it wanted to see it again, if for no other reason that to get a second look at the Times Square Scene, which I originally had believed was computerized.  Then I began to talk to other movie-goers, friends who saw it later, then after release to video, friends who bought the film.This is when the film became even more fun than before.  On viewing, the visuals were lush, the music rocked, the cast was beautiful, the morality tale of the danger of depending on your wealth and your looks, were all great assets.  But the discussions with friends and the reading of reviews; the hearing others tell you, ""I got it too..."", then relating an entirely different take on the film, what it meant, what it was, how it happened...that was just too much fun.So, I delayed getting the DVD for awhile so that I couldn't hear the commentary until I had read/heard dozens and dozens of 'meanings'.  Now, having watched the film again several times on my own DVD, I did indeed 'get it' the first time, but unlike so many of these other reviewers, I don't see that as a negative.  I liked figuring it out.  Hearing the commentary confirm that it was indeed 'a' possible version that the director had in his mind was interesting, as was so much more of his commentary and inside information about the film itself and the making of the movie.

In this version the time is changed (I don't generally like modern settings of Shakespeare, but this one is acceptable), and the acting is great.Kevin Kline is outstanding as Bottom, and adds so much depth to this character.  Tucci is great as Puck, and Calista Flockhart turns in a decent performance as Helena.  The special effects add a lot, as it is, after all, a fairy kingdom.  The play within the play is outrageously funny and unexpectly touching. Still, it is the portayal of the characters that make this production outstanding.  It adds a certain tenderness to the play that I never fully realized before.",Midsummer Night's Dream VHS

572079,"&quot;How To Marry A Millionaire&quot;, produced in 1953 by 20th Century Fox, was the original vehicle for introducing Fox's revolutionary Cinemascope presentation to the public (however, &quot;The Robe&quot; would be the first CinemaScope film actually released) and it showcased a number of Fox's established and rising stars.The main body of the movie follows the lives of three New York models (played by Marilyn Monroe, Betty Grable, and Lauren Bacall) in their pursuit of luxury and ease through matrimony. Bacall is the driving force of this team effort, arranging for for them to live in a luxury flat, laying down the ground rules, and singlehandedly maintaining the facade of a sophiscated livestyle. However, Bacall's character tends to judge others by their apparent sophistication. Monroe and Grable characters are less mercenary than Bacall and each has a small character flaw that sometimes leads them astray. Monroe has poor eyesight but refuses to wear her glasses in public which leads to the predictable bumping into people and objects. Grable, on the other hand, is somewhat scatterbrained, usually leading her to miscontrue statements made to her. After initially working together, each character goes into her own vignette, highlighting her path to love, and then they meet up again at the end where of course each of their paths ends in a manner different than the one they had imagined.Considering the mostly lightweight script, the acting is very good on the whole. Although many viewers today would see the movie to watch Marilyn Monroe, it is Lauren Bacall and Betty Grable who give the better performances. Bacall is excellent in her debut in a comedy role and Grable is an absolute delight, dispensing a sometimes skewed view of life that often finds its mark. The supporting cast is also quite excellent, in particular the performances by William Powell, David Wayne, and Cameron Mitchell.There are a number of things in the film that may confuse or at least put off today's audiences. The movie opens with a orchestra playing a composition by Alfred Neuman (who is seen conducting) and then shows a number of panoramic shots throughout the film. It is important to remember that the biggest star of this movie was suppose to be the new Cinemascope presentation and Fox's new High Fidelity sound system. While these scenes wowwed audiences in theaters during the film's initial release, watching the same scenes from a DVD widescreen version on a television set greatly lessens their impact.Nonetheless, if you like the movies of the fifties or a fan of of any of the three principal actors, &quot;How To Marry A Millionaire&quot; should be one to add to your collection. Today's audiences will find the story a dated one but much of the humor will translates well to the present. This is a very enjoyable movie.",N/A
532944,"My only question is: with such a big budget, and such good actors, how could they go wrong?The answer is simple: Its clear that the talent behind this movie spent more time on the CGI than on writing a decent script.D&D; is the story of two thieves who decide to take advantage of a magical disaster to break into a Mage Academy and burglarize the place. In doing so, they accidentally get embroiled in a plot to kill the empress's advisor and procure a mystical scepter which will allow the bad guys to maintain the status quo of peasant oppression.What follows is a special-effects extravaganza, with about as much plot and character development as a Shatner movie.Stereotypes abound as the Anglo main character and his ethnic sidekick battle evil in the form of (surprise) a group of evil mages composed of... Guess. More evil Anglo men. The troupe is completed with the edition of a red-bearded Scottish sounding dwarf (of course), and a waifish... Elven ranger.The actors give half-hearted attempts to deliver their lines, but even THEY seem embarrassed to be there.The only thing that worked for me in this movie was the great special effects and the beautiful dragon sequences. (What was with the villian with the blue lip-gloss???)If you want cheesy fantasy action with no plot rent Kull or Beastmater or even Conan. D&D; was just embarrassing.",Dungeons & Dragons

681370,"I really enjoyed &quot;Ghost World&quot; and having been an angst ridden  &quot;outsider&quot; in high school myself, I could relate to the alienation of the central character, Enid. The movie although peppered with prickly humor and oddball characters has a true-to-life feel that effectively resonates  that universal sense of alienation that we have all experienced at one time or another just by virtue of having once been a teenager. The movie starts off as a comedy but  as Enid's self destructive behavior progressively manifests itself,  it ultimately achieves a real poignancy. The ending is the sort of Anti-Hollywood ending guaranteed to leave it out the running for an academy award. And that's a shame too, as the acting, directing and script were all first rate. And to all those who dismissed this as a &quot;chick-flick&quot;, you missed out on a real comic gem and believe me, I'm no &quot;chick&quot;.Recommended",N/A
684103,"I'm sure some people were disappointed by the absence of Fred, Daphne, and Velmah. I know some people don't like Scrappy. And I am quite sure that some people would rather see the typical bad guy in mask scenario. But if we are willing to accept something different, this is a wonderful Scooby movie. It starts normal enough with Shaggy winning a race. Alright. The monsters pass plausibility. But overall, they did a good job of adding some human plausible traits to the monsters. Dracula is ofcourse a bad guy. But he does entertain us, and at times, we may find ourselves feeling at least a little sorry for him. The chemistry between him and Vanapyra is wonderful! The Hunch bunch offers the wonderful contrast between the clearly educated Brunch and the not so intelligent Crunch. Googy is an interesting guest star who provides a voice of reason in all the chaos. Alright. The movie may seem a little long. But this is easy to overlook seeing that the comedy never stops. I find it tragic that a lot of 'so called' adult comedy relies on low, redundant, and amoral humour that often leads to certain audiences feeling hurt and insulted. And this 'so called' kids movie has some of the highest levels of comedy out there. (Tongue and cheek, situational comedy, and sudden plays to the audience, etc) It would appear that since kids would be watching this, they couldn't throw amoral, disgusting, and offensive slapstick humour in. So they had to take time to make it intelligent! Granted, this is different from regular Scooby, but we still have the antics of Shaggy and Scooby, as well as their unusual enthusiasm over food. I am certain that some people will always prefer the old episodes, and that some people would rather see the newer movies with Fred, Daphne, and Velmah as well. But if you are open to something that is different, but still great, and flat out hilarious, pick this tape up.",N/A
698835,"Benjamin Bratt stars as Miguel Pinero, a Nuyorican poet-playwright and habitual criminal who is credited as a seminal influence on East Coast hip-hop and boriqueno salsa culture.  The acting throughout is excellent, but the episodic, disconnected narrative and style-heavy editing ultimately undercut the film.  It's not simply that the presentation is nonlinear; rather, it's that the film is ineffective at explaining Pinero's relationships to his friends, lovers and his art, all of which are hazily outlined, and difficult to care about.  The poet's triumphs and failings abruptly emerge then melt away, as the director and editor try to infuse their film with the same intensity and explosive, rhythmic charisma as its subject.  They also seem to assume a high level of audience familiarity with the Pinero's work, and thus fail to frame him as effectively as similar artist bioflicks such as ""Basquiat"" and ""Before Night Falls,"" which more clearly defined their subjects.  This probably is a brilliant film, but I found myself irritated that I had to work so hard to maintain my interest, and while I found the performances magnetic and absorbing, many other aspects were irritating and pretentious.",Pinero
24658,"I suspect this is one of those love or hate movies depending on whether or not it strikes an emotional cord within the viewer. To those used to such absolutes as plot and action it will be a bust. To those who love the David Lean directorial approach of each scene being a visual image that could stand alone, then this is a treat. I believe the title is Italian for I remember, and this is what the movie is. Fellini's reminscences of growing up in pre-war Italy. They are presented as a series of linked vignettes populated with an extravagant and eccentric collection of characters. Wonderfully evocative, lewd and bawdy, funny and sad, it's a languid walk through one man's memories. I don't collect movies but this is one I own and love to dip into once in a while.

456184,"Who is Sir/Saint Thomas More?  Or better yet, what?  As depicted here, he is an odd mix of hero and stooge, wise man and pedant.  That artful mix is the strength of this story of the life of a remarkably intelligent and, in his own, bent way, couragious man.  For, if nothing else, More had the fortitude to give his life for his beliefs, even if those beliefs were inexplicably odd.The story is told against the backdrop of a corrupt Roman Catholic church, and a corrupt king, Henry XIII.  Henry, mad, passionate, and lecherous by turn, enters the story as a man without an heir, and interested in dumping his queen for a woman who can produce the next king.  The Pope, leader of a corrupt legion of priests, bishops, and cardinals who have more carnal than knowledge, stands firm that no divorce will be allowed, and thus no remarriage.  As we meet More, it appears that without his participation to one degree or another, Henry will not be able to switch wives as he had planned.  There is a bit of confusion here as Henry at first seeks an annulment, it appears, and then later seeks to gain the blessing of More that his marriage ought to be treated as void ab initio.  In any event, the Pope ultimately says no to Henry's plans, and then the pressure is on More, a dear friend of the looney king, to find a way out.  More refuses to do anything which might conflict with the will of the Pope, and thus the battle is joined--either More will side with Henry, at the expense of Rome, or he will stand firm with the Pope--putting everything he knows and loves at risk.Here's the ultimate problem--one with the story as much as the film.  For as bright and honorable as More might be, his honor leads him to support a church that is corrupt to its core.  It also leads him to be intellectually and emotionally brutish and self-deceptive by turns.  Certainly, he was a man of principle, but to what end?  There is much to admire in him, but just as much to leave you shaking your head and wondering whether he was just a smart guy with a martyrdom complex.This movie has some beautiful cinematography, and some nice acting turns, including by Scofield, who won an Oscar for portraying More.  Orson Welles looks like a bloated corpse, but nonetheless provides an nice performance as a thoroughly corrupt Cardinal who is perplexed by More's decision to allow something as silly as private morality guide his public acts.  In this regard, it is an especially timely commentary on a church which seems to have changed very little in 500 years.",N/A

She soon turns into a fast-living, mean-tempered lush.  Heddy accompanies violinist husband Philip Dorn to an audition; he doesn't get the job, but she gets snatched up to become a beauty queen.  Offended by her admirers, Heddy's husband believes she is unfaithful and leaves her.  Judy has worked her way up through the ranks of show business and is hired for her way with a song--but Ziegfeld doesn't want to the hire other half of her act, Judy's father Charles Winninger.To say the actors are typecast is a gross understatement, and in truth Heddy is merely there for decoration and Judy tucked into the film for the occasional musical number.  The film really belongs to Lana Turner, who--although somewhat wooden--has the most interesting role of the three, and to James Stewart, who like Lana is a good boy gone bad.  Will Lana and Jimmy reform and get back together?  Will Heddy be able to convince Philip that her love is true?  Will Judy's father ever forgive her?  Even though the movie is hokey and a bit overlong, it is still rather fun to watch--and such numbers as ""Minnie From Trinidad"" are lots of fun.

661956,"Peter Mullan's debut film as writer/director...looks, at first sight, highly unpromising.It's about four Scottish siblings between late teens and late thirties dealing with the death of their mother.  Okay, if you happen to be a fan of, say, Kieslowski, you may perk up at this point, but this is not that sort of film.  Like ""Three Colours: Blue"", it never shies away from the pain of grieving.  Unlike that film, it also has a completely berserk sense of the ridiculous.The siblings themselves are the pious elder brother Thomas, his sceptical younger brother Michael, sister Sheila who has cerebral palsy (I don't know if Rosemarie Stephenson, who plays Sheila, actually _has_ cerebral palsy - but whether she does or not, she's truly extraordinary) and hothead college-boy John.  The story takes place during the night before the funeral, and the morning of the funeral itself, and it gets going in brutal style with a nasty fight in a pub.  It goes on to include a plaster statue of the Virgin Mary being shattered on a church floor, a disastrous attempt to scare someone who happens to be jerking off at the time, the most malevolent bar-owner in cinema history, and a church roof being torn off in a thunderstorm.""Orphans"" is one of the very few films to approach the insanity and awful comedy of grief, the way that messy life insists on intruding upon your own private despair.  Mullan's script is ruthlessly truthful, his direction is unfailingly inventive and daring, and the film manages to be the product of a truly unholy schtup between Robert Bresson and the Weitz brothers.  The cast is uniformly excellent, with special frond-type things going to the four leads, Douglas Henshall, Gary Lewis, Stephen McCole and Rosemarie Stephenson.  It also has a sort-of cameo by Billy Connolly, of all people, as an unseen, absent God.Filmmaking doesn't get much darker, funnier or wiser than this.  Do yourself a favour and check it out.",Orphans
436477,"A word to the wise: anyone preparing to watch Lucio Fulci's gore-infested splatter flick ""Zombie"" may want to keep a couple of trash bags ready in case you feel the need to spew. Laugh if you will at this warning, but don't dare say you weren't informed.Like so many films from Italian filmmakers, ""Zombie"" follows a similar path where one can expect a plethora of bloodshed and violent murder, all stitched to a story that exists solely for its makeup effects. Add to that a cast of B-list and unknown actors, and English dubbing that never fits the movement of the characters' mouths, and you have a formula for yet another cheesy horror movie that is sure to become (and has become) a cult classic.It opens with the obligatory suspense setup, in which an unmanned sailboat meanders aimlessly throughout New York harbor. As the Coast Guard investigates, a strange, corpse-like creature rips out one officer's throat before he is shot by the second, falling into the water Is he really dead? Can the undead even be killed?Getting back on track, Ann Bowles (Tisa Farrow) the daughter of the boat's owner, becomes worrisome when told that her father was not on board the vessel; after crossing paths with reporter Peter West (Ian McCulloch), the two embark on a journey to Matul, a small, uncharted Caribbean island where a Dr. Menard (Richard Johnson) has been performing tests on fatally diseased patients from a small village.The ""zombie phenomenon,"" as it is dubbed by Menard, is never really explained in detail. First we are informed that the villagers suffer from some form of widespread disease. Down the road, the movie changes course, turning to elements of voodoo and witchcraft; though this seems the more likely path, it still remains uncertain. And while it is of little importance, it does tend to nag one if thought about in excess.And speaking of excess, you may not find a collection of gore as shocking and gruesome as what ""Zombie"" has to offer. Once on the island, Ann and Peter, along with shipmates Brian and Susan, seek out Menard to inquire about Ann's missing father, whom they are told died of the disease. All the while, corpses are rising out of the ground, from the hospital beds in a converted church, to an old Spanish burial ground, ready to take a bite out of anything that lives and breathes.Some of these images are hard to shake from memory: in one of the movie's most famed scenes, a victim is impaled through her eyeball by a wooden splinter. Later, we return to this gruesome scene to witness various zombies chowing down on her remains. Despite their rancid appearance, the makeup is undoubtedly realistic, and provides for a chilling shock factor that does evoke a slight degree of suspense.However, if you've seen one attack, you've seen them all. From there on, it's mainly a vomitorium of zombies taking large bites out of victims' throats, arms and legs, all of which is propagated by massive amounts of dark, gushing blood. I hate to say it, but it does tend to get old after some time, and as the movie begins to reach its climax, culminating in a showdown where the remaining survivors are trapped in the hospital surrounded by zombies, the predictability shatters the energy.For horror buffs and gore aficionados, ""Zombie"" is a must-see. For those familiar with the works of George Romero and the great Dario Argento, Fulci's film will seem like just another exercise in repellant horror, a copycat film that is less appealing and less entertaining.",Zombie VHS

185527,"There's a lot to like about Schoolhouse Rock. I grew up watching it just like everybody else my age.Looking back on it now, sure, the nostalgia factor is high.  But sometimes, the various segments can be factually inaccurate.For example, the ""Verb"" song identifies ""batting"" as a verb, when it's actually a gerund that acts as a noun in a sentence. Example: ""I like batting."" The subject is ""I"". The verb is ""like"". And the object -- which has to be a noun -- is the gerund ""batting"". Now, maybe gerunds are a little beyond the scope of the song, but then it should have stuck to plain old verbs like ""bat"" (I bat, you bat, etc.), not ""batting"".Another problem is that ""Interplanet Janet"" strongly implies that the sun is a planet, when it is actually a star. (The lyrics briefly -- very briefly -- mention that it's a star, but the overwhelming repetition of the word ""planet"" in the song, as well as the inclusion of the Sun along with all the other planets in order, implies that the sun's a planet too, just like all the others.)There are other slip-ups like this throughout the series, if you look for them.

Additionally, like many of the other Sturges films, it manages to get away with a lot for a movie made in the 1940s (when movies were still under the Hays production code).Essentially, The Lady Eve is the story of a naive (but very wealthy) adventurer right out of the Amazon, played by Henry Fonda (in his only screwball performance) who meets a sly and sexy girl named Eve, played by Barbara Stanwyck on a boat and immediately falls for her. When, however, he realizes she and her father are really professional gamblers who roam around getting money from people by playing card games, he is furious and leaves her.

Although her part is crucial within the story it really is secondary and really doesn't add anything or allow Liu to shine.Basically if your a Jackie Chan fan or an Owen Wilson fan you won't be disappointed with this film.

In the process, they meet a beautiful Spanish girl who is about ten years older than them and ultimately invite her to a beach that is supposed to exist somewhere along the Mexico coast but doesn't really exist at all. The metaphor here is too thick for words.To watch the three of them interact while driving to the ""beach"" is fun but one gets the feeling that there was zero script and that the whole thing was improvised. Of course, nobody would ever KNOW this because the audio-commentary on the DVD is in total Spanish and even an individual who was totally fluent in the language wouldn't understand it because the cast and crew sound like they're speaking from an acoustic bathroom with a pillow over the mike. It also doesn't help that they seem to be drunkenly rambling and that's a shame because I really would have liked to hear the thoughts from the cast and crew.Anyhow, for all the hooplah that surrounds this film, it really IS sexy...it's just that most of what is here is a juvenille and silly mess. The forementioned narration is TOTALLY off and at times, is SO separate from the film, that you actually wait for one of the actors to look at the camera and say, ""Shut up! That's not even what I'm thinking at ALL!""It would have been better had you had SEEN the emotion described to you because it's not there otherwise and that just mucks things up.The locales in the film are used nicely.

476298,"George Lucas wrote and directed the very funny 'American Graffiti' and the very imaginative 'Star Wars'. So what happend, George. What happened to 'Star Wars Episode 1: The Phantom Menace'??? The reason I bring this ancient movie (1999) up now is because Lucas' new film, 'Star Wars II: Attack of the Clones' is arriving in theaters in May of this year. I have a feeling this next film will be better than the last. I hope to GOD it is for everyone's sake. It really IS a good series (all except for the last atrocity - I give it two stars for its special effects and Ewan McGregor). There was a rumor going around: some of the actors, especially star Liam Neeson, noticed that Lucas was more interested in the technical aspects of the film rather than the actors. No wonder the acting was so wooden. Neeson, Natalie Portman (most of the time) and the boy (the one who played 'Anakin Walker - the future 'Darth Vader' - give me a break) all came across as wooden heads, and the boy is especially bad. Sorry. Sorry. I shouldn't blame the boy. I blame Lucas for not working with this kid, and for allowing such brilliant actors as Neeson to stroll through the role like the lobotomized Jedi Knight he was. McGregor at least 'tried' to add something extra, but when you have a director (Lucas again) who cares absolutely nothing for the actor, the script, the story, etc., 'The Phantom Menace' is bound to become not only one of the worst movies in 1999, but one of the worst science fiction movies I have ever seen. I have read some reviews commenting on the red-faced Darth Maul. What a clown. He was one millionth what Darth Vader (James Earl Jones - remember him???) was. Maybe Lucas shouldn't direct these movies. Like in 'The Empire Strikes Back' (easily the best of the films) and 'Return of the Jedi', Lucas hired others. Maybe he has lost 'touch' with humanity. Maybe he himself, like his numbing creation 'Jar Jar Binks', has also turned into some kind of dull alien whose only interests lie in boring audiences with the latest in super-technology. I know at one time Steven Spielberg had expressed interest in directing one of them. Maybe Lucas should remain 'behind the scenes' (and I do mean WAY behind the scenes). The real talent is always in the writers (good writers, George), the actors, and the hundreds of craftsmen who put together such an eventful science fiction film. Sooooooo, 'Phantom Menace' was a real dud. Will I see the next film??? Even though I am not happy with the title 'Attack of the Clones'???. Another hour and they have come up with a MUCH better title, guarenteed. But remember this, Lucas doesn't care about titles or scripts or actors - afterall he is truly a cyborg with no emotions, something his fans didn't know I bet. Still, I look forward to watching the 'newer' Star Wars saga. It features actors like Natalie Portman, Ewan McGregor (I loved him in 'Moulin Rouge' - you should see that if you haven't already), Samuel L. Jackson and Christopher Lee (I LOVE Mr. Lee). I also heard that Hayden Christensen is a HUGE improvement over that 'kid' (I don't blame the kid - I blame the director). And the special effects should be masterful no doubt (afterall, Lucas OWNS ILM up north). 'Attack of the Clones' (WHAT a title), I can only wish upon a midnight star, will be a VAST improvement over the disappointing 'Phantom Menace' which took the series to an all-time low. Please, George Lucas, move to the planet Endor or at least wake up and smell the Wookies. A meaningful story, good writing, attention to the actors is what makes a film GREAT. The special effects can only enhance a film's quality, and we know Lucas is an expert at F/X. Well, I am crossing my fingers that May's 'Attack of the Clones' is indeed memorable and falls into line with 'The Empire Strikes Back'. Hey, one can only wish, can't they.",N/A
671766,"There is only one reason to see this movie and that is Reese Witherspoon. And with her bright, comic flair even she has to dog paddle through certain points of the film just to stay afloat.A living Malibu Barbie, Elle Woods is a fashion design major. That is until her boyfriend announces he's going to Harvard Law and dumps her because Elle's image doesn't fit into his future plans of a life in politics. Still in love with the superficial louse, Elle decides to get her man and applies to Harvard Law School. Her application video is quite funny in it's over the top approach. Mesmerised by her audacious tape and impressed by her more obvious talents (hair, figure) the male admissions board alots an opening to the luscious Ms. Woods. Upon arriving at Harvard Law, Elle runs into her ex-flame and is surprised by his surprise at seeing her there. ""Like it's hard?"" she asks incredulously. The ex's new girlfriend is prim and proper, the ideal candidate's wife. She sets out to ridicule Elle, who sticks out like a sore thumb in this Ivy League enclave. After several setbacks, a depressed Elle finally finds a friend in the local beautician. Then encouraged by a seemingly sympathetic Professor,Elle decides to make the best out of her time at Harvard Law and does so with dogged determiniation (reminiscent of her performance in ELECTION).Reese does an incredible job considering the poor material she's given. While the premise is full of comic potential, it is little more than that--a premise. The story is never fully developed so her setbacks and victories are pretty much one note. I get the feeling there's actually less story in the script than is given on film by the very good cast helmed by Ms. Witherspoon. It's not a terrible film but it could have been so much better.",Legally Blonde
195383,"I'm so tired of hearing bad things about this anime, like bad character developement, bad story, too violent, hentai, whatever.This story is really not as straiforward as it seems,  why else would the ending be so confusing to some. In my opinion there is also a lot of character devepement. Sawa was young and terrified when her parents were killed. The detective guy raped her at this time when she was most vulnerable and took her in. We know he then trained her to be a killer but I believe the anime does a wonderful job explaining how she succumbed to it.It actually reminds me of that old South Park episode where the volcano erupted while Stan's uncle Jim was taking the kids hunting. When it was Stan's turn to shoot, he aimed at the rabbit and then was like, ""I don't want to kill the bunny"" and it escaped and everyone got angry. At the end he finally ends up killing something for the sake of being accepted even though it was against his nature.Sawa is the same. Her face is always sad and she doen't like what she is doing. She's young and impressionable and doesn't have the mental strenth and confidence to get away. This is why I find the story so touching. It's really very sad.Oh yeah and about the violence, Maybe it is a littleexcessive but I thought the fight seens were absolutely awesome. I mean, a lot of anime is violent with teh whole neon pink blood thing happening so what's the problem?The sex though is a bit extreme. In a way, it better explains Sawa's situation and how she came to be tied to that detective guy. She doesn't have the strength to fight it (mentally that is since it is sooo obvious she's a great assasin). If u're that offended by graphic sex (there is a lot) then just watch the edited version. I didn't think it was all that bad. Actually the sex was almost what probably what made so many women not like the movie so the edited version is better for us females. Guys i'm sure don't mind so PLEASE see this movie with an open mind and actually listen to everything they say.THIS IS A GOOD MOVIE!!",N/A
257865,"David Mamet is utterly relentless, and his plays and films never give a character a break. People in his world start out desperate and stay desperate trying to do the wrong things for the right reasons, or doing the right thing despite their own corrupt souls. The Verdict is one of Mamet's finer works, and in the hands of director Sidney Lumet, it becomes a shining example of how story makes character, character makes story, and both force a vision on a sensitive director.Set in the maximium Catholic world of Boston, the Verdict tells the tale of a pretty boy whose failure to believe in deep corruption has turned him into a numb fool. The Church preaches redemption, but offers none, and Frank Galvin knows this deep in his soul, which is why he can't leave the womb-like sepia of his bar to face the blue cold. He is pityful, useless and defeated as only a pretty boy can be wrecked. But this modern reading of the Book of Job doesn't end there. Offered a gimme case, Galvin heads right for the gutter, until, in a moment of clarity, he visits the bleak ward where the object of the lawsuit rots in the arms of mother Church.Arrayed against this consummate loser are God, and the Prince of Darkness in concert. James Mason's valedictorian role is among his finest, so clean, so unafraid of turning men and women into whores and liars; he is a black hole of confidence and Mamet shows again and again how Concannon and his people are great lawyers, while Galvin can barely think.Things go from bad to worse: the family of the destroyed woman want to settle; the doctor tapped for testimony disappears; the expert witness is a hack doctor (and the unspoken racial overtones of who is credible and who is not are one of the most shocking parts of this film); and his key testimony and witness are disallowed unfairly.This is a writer writing properly: no breaks, no luck, no hope in the slightest for Frank Galvin. He wants redemption, he's going to get a belly full of it. The vicious dialogs between Charlotte Rampling's troubled character and Newman are so perfect and acidic that I cringe. A great example of two characters working from different internal scripts.There is so much good in this film, that I watch it over and over again, sometimes for the East Coast winter ambiance, sometimes for the joy of watching James Mason sneer, sometimes to watch Paul Newman beg Milo O'Shea. There is so much to learn from this film. Neither Lumet nor Newman has ever done better. Mamet's gold standard is Glen Gary Glenross. I would love to have seen this cast in that film. Alas. Too late.It's a sad and sick world, one Frank Galvin would recognize, that grants awards to Ghandi (boring,)Gladiator and A Beautiful Mind, but fails to see gold before their eyes.If you are a writer, or want to write, sit down and watch this film, take notes, and see if you can reforge a character, which is what the Verdict is really about.",N/A

Mostly the ones between Stuart Townsend and Aaliyah. One of my favorite scenes would have to be when Lestat was playing his violin for the statue of Akasha. The only thing that got me was this: What you KNOW is that the title, ""Queen of the Damned"", suggests that Aaliyah has the big (better yet biggest) part in the movie. What you DON'T KNOW is that Aaliyah is in the last half of the movie. Well, with the part she was given Aaliyah was fantastic. Overall, ""Queen of the Damned"" is well-worth a watch.

687542,"Remember Osamu Tezuka for his work on Astro Boy and Kimba? Well, even though he died of stomach cancer in 1989 doesn't mean his artwork is dead. With combined forces of Katsuhura Otomo (who was also working on Spriggan at the time) and Rintaro (who oddly enough was denied to make a movie of Metropolis when Tezuka was alive) combine on what has become the new AKIRA of the 21st Century.Ironically enough, Metropolis (when it was published in 1947) is set in the year 2000. After the completed Ziggurat has been built in Metropolis, the most popular billionare in Metropolis, Duke Red, plans to use an android modeled after his dead daughter to rule the world. However, with deception a foot and political themes getting way out of hand turns Metropolis into a ticking time bomb. When Kenichi and his uncle San go to Metropolis to arrest Doctor Laughton for vivisection and organ dealing. However, when they finally find him, Duke Red's adopted son Rock has already set the lab on fire. Inside, Kenichi meets a girl that changes his life forever.What I love the best about Metropolis is that it sticks extremely close to Osamu Tezuka's original designs while at the same time successfully combining it with CG and fluid animation. And since it has been five years in the making, you know it is going to look good. One of the main points about Metropolis is the heavy detail. Everything is highly detailed from people to blimbs to trains to cars are all successfully combined to make the cityscape easy to get use to.Many are wondering what the English dub is like since Metropolis was released in theaters in it's original Japanese form. The script is fairy close to the original, but not dead on which is sometimes a good time. The dub actors aren't famous, but they are people who know how to do voice acting. Notice how Kenichi is played by the same guy who does the voice of Jim Hawking on Outlaw Star and that Tima's voice actress use to do the voice of Minmei on Robotech.The DVD features on the mini-disc are pretty good if you really want to get down and dirty with Metropolis. Everything is here from production designs, animation comparisons, history of the comic, biographies, featurette and interviews. I should however mention there is a preview for the Cowboy Bebop movie coming out soon, but it's mostly old footage you've probably already seen for it.Overall, Metropolis is a great film that can be enjoyed by all ages. Highly recommended for all audiances even if they don't have any knowledge of the comic at all.",N/A

Then there are people like me - those who saw it to see Natalie Portman or Hayden Christiansen (if you're a girl).And although this movie is definitely better than it's predecessor, it still is lacking. It has more action, more lightsabres, some familiar locations (i.e. Owen's farm on Tatooine), and [stuff] like that. So why was this movie lacking? It just didn't have that Star Wars charm that the old movies all had. And the effects in the new versions look unbelievably 'computerized'. I know you're thinking, ""well they ARE computerized!"".This is true. But my point is that the purpose of special effects is to blend them into the movie as much as possible - these effects don't do that.

To put it bluntly, they're too simple and repetitive!And what in the [heck] happened to Yoda's puppet?? Do they have to use computers for EVERYTHING??The romance [stuff] was cheesy and typical.

Yet this paranoid fantasy never manages to scare its audience, it doesn't even manage to make them care.  It has Ryan Phillipe as a computer whizz who discovers that the man who has employed him (Robbins) is killing off his competitors.There are countless flaws in this movie, especially in casting Ryan Phillipe as the main character.  Marvellous as he was in 'Cruel Intentions', he cannot play a nerd to save his life, even if someone obviously did think that he could if he was wearing glasses.  As the computer business owner, in a clumsy parallel with Bill Gates, Robbins switches between serious and ludicrous.  Both are good actors stuck in the wrong movie.  The two female leads, Claire Forlani and Rachel Leigh Cook are used as eye candy and little else.  Someone should have thought long and hard before casting a lot of beautiful teenagers as computer geniuses.There is nothing sophisticated or even remotely realisitic about this.  For example, Robbins has his enemies killed through street thugs.  A thousand other paranoid fantasies in this vein are out there and 'Antitrust' would have to come at the bottom of the pile.  The countless twists and turns in the tale certainly aren't ironic, they're just plain stupid.  Plus, it's unclear who Howitt was aiming the movie at.

In Italy those are funeral flowers, just like the white roses they used to put in the folded hands of dead people. Another thing I noticed was the clock. Not just the face of the clock but the scythe and the snake carved into the top of it. The snake, I do not know if it has any particular meaning, but the scythe should be obvious enough.I also found much subtle humour in the dialogue... making it worthy of laughs without distracting from the sombre theme of the film. Of course there are all the melodramatic love-speeches, but those are fun to listen to. And there are the two women at war for the attentions of the very attractive and mysterious Sirki. With a name like Sirki and from a country called Talba-Alexandri (or whatever it was), who could resist? Anyway, they are quite funny to watch, fighting over the Prince. And, by the way, Prince Sirki's snazzy outfits were some of best (I think) of Fredric March's career.Overall I enjoyed the movie so very much the second time - it's definitely one of my favourite Fredric March films. I recommend it highly.",Death Takes a Holiday VHS

377499,"I just had the opportunity to watch the three components of this magnificent trilogy that wrapped up the creative life of Polish-born director Krzysztof Kieslowski, and while I still think that watching the three in order (in the same order as they were released, after the French flag: &quot;Blue,&quot; &quot;White&quot; and &quot;Red&quot;) I found &quot;Red&quot; to be beyond just the culmination of the series. Ir&egrave;ne Jacob (Valentine), who had previously worked with Kieslowski in his 1991 feature &quot;The Double Life of Veronique&quot; delivers a fascinating performance by staying right on the verge of falling for the retired judge (Jean-Louis Trintignant) whom she manages to subtly redeem, but never letting herself go... Her fate is almost written by the judge, a character that gradually becomes omniscient and &quot;all powerful,&quot; ultimately driving Valentine toward her destiny, one which somehow does not differ much from ending in love with him... (intriguing huh?)A story of love (thus the color red), somehow; a story of redemption in a way as well, although the movie can stand by itself it curiously goes beyond itself if you have had a chance to watch all three. As an example of this, note the old hunchback lady struggling to push an empty bottle into the recycling bin, and the reactions of the main characters in the three movies. In &quot;Blue,&quot; Julie shows total indifference, eyes closed, denoting &quot;freedom,&quot; liberty from the world, from life, &quot;independence.&quot; In &quot;White,&quot; Karol contemplates the lady struggling but does little to help her, after all (he might have thought to himself,) &quot;my life is every bit as miserable or even  worse -let her deal with her own misery.&quot; A sign of &quot;equality&quot; it could be said, though clearly misunderstood, every bit as much as Jelie's &quot;liberty.&quot; Finally, in &quot;Red&quot; Valentine helps the lady with the bottle (a sign of charity, love or &quot;fraternity,&quot; if you may). A very clear connection between the movies' titles and the ideals that each of them conveys in the French national flag, way beyond the illumination that also characterizes each of the movies.The movie brilliantly ends in a tone that makes it clear to the viewer that the main characters of the three-part series accomplished closure, redemption in their lives, by ending up next to their truly loved ones. All in all, a masterpiece, worth watching several times.",Red VHS
242216,"Alcoholism has been seen on movies for a very long time. Many people just haven't realized it because it was never something to care much for. Drinking was often the stuff of comedy. This was because most of what we saw about it was the effects while someone was drunk and making fools of themselves. In 1945, director Billy Wilder made a film called ""The Lost Weekend"", that dealt with the subject in a different light. The movie was not expected to be a hit, having been a controversial project and being poorly received by preview audiences. But it turned out to be a surprise hit with critics and won academy awards for Best Picture, Best Director, Best Screenplay and Best Actor.  Here are some reasons as to why this movie is great, along with some of its cons.""You know, the circle is the perfect geometric figure. No end, no beginning."" The figure of a circle is used often in the movie, primarily in the plot. The story revolves around that of a failed writer (Ray Milland, who I discuss in detail later) and his trouble with alcohol. The usage of a circular plot structure suggests that the life of a drunk is followed by one binge after another, with no start and no finish. It is also used when Don is under alcohol's spell. An example is the usage of rings from the shot glasses to show passage of time.The lead performance: After years of acting, Milland hit it big as Don Birnam, the unsuccessful, alcoholic writer who goes on a drinking binge (""I'm not a drinker, I'm a drunk""). Milland's character is a tortured one, who claims that there are, figuratively, two of him: Don the writer and Don drunk. Milland can be melodramatic in his performance, but what do you expect from a film like this? One has to congratulate Milland for having the guts to take this role, for his character is a liar and thief who only cares about and will do anything for one more drink. It is amazing how he is able to be despicable and still allow us to sympathize with his character. Like many male leads in Wilder's films, Don Brinam is flawed in how he is weak and, though he tries not to, easily succumbs to the bottle (""The reason is me- what I am, or rather what I'm not). Though other great male performances were done in 1945, Milland was deserving of his Oscar.Supporting Cast: Jane Wyman, as Don's girl Helen, is not as involved, in my humble opinion, as Milland is, but is still able to turn out well. The problem is that her character doesn't get to do much, except try to talk to Don when he is hungover. The supporting cast does better, starting with Wick (Phillip Terry), Don's caring and dedicated brother, who is annoyed by his drinking yet allows him to stay at his apartment (""I went over the apartment with a fine-tooth comb - the places he can figure out""). A scene-stealer is Nat (Howard da Silva), a bartender who is friendly to Don but is also irritated by his unkindness to women and his alcoholism (""One's too many and a hundred's not enough!""). There is also Gloria (Doris Dowling), a slim, attractive woman who visits Nat's place to wait for other men. (She is most likely a female escort). She uses a lot of word abbreviations, such as ""ridick"" for ridiculous or ""natch"" for naturally. My favorite appearance was by an uncredited Frank Faylen as ""Bim"", a [seemingly] homosexual male nurse at an alcoholic ward called ""Hangover Plaza"". He sets the stage for Don by telling him ""...you're just a freshman. Wait'll you're a sophomore. That's when you start seeing the little animals.""Feel: The movie's black and white cinematography is shot in a way that it presents the feeling of a nightmare. This way is difficult to explain, except that this illusion is presented most effectively in black and white and would be lost in a color film. This is probably because B & W, I think, is more moody. It's also interesting how several scenes are shot through whiskey bottles or shot glasses.Music Score: It seems odd to talk about the music, but it is important. It was the first to use a theremin, an instrument that produces a strange wailing sound. Used in the nightmare scenes, it would later be familiar with fans of `50's sci-fi films. However, the non-thermin score is also one of the few downsides. Sometimes, especially during the opening credits, it feels too upbeat, too much like a film noir.""The Lost Weekend"" is by no means a cheerful movie. It does have some great dialogue (A trademark of Wilder films), but overall it's as entertaining and upbeat as a brain tumor. In addition to being depressing, it's also melodramatic, but that's a minor problem. I rather have a movie that tries to go for realism and honesty in this subject. Also, being a nearly 60 year-old movie and a groundbreaker in this subject, it is bound to have dated in some respects.(Major plot spoilers ahead) But wait, am I a hypocrite? After all, it can be said that the ending feels too upbeat and optimistic. Many complain about this and it does indeed seem to be like this. But is it? A person who is a heavy drinker, I think, can't stop in the blink of an eye. However, this time he has a cause and an idea for writing and that will definitely help him.A mixed bag, no doubt. But there is more good than bad. This is one that grows with repeated viewing.  Wilder was certainly a great director, one who could make you as easily affected as he could make you laugh. He will be missed very much.",The Lost Weekend VHS

112492,"""North by Northwest"" is Alfred Hitchcock's followup to 1958's moody ""Vertigo.""  While it's not as ""deep"" as the latter film, ""N by NW"" is a first-rate action/mystery film that stands as one of the greatest films of all time.  The ever-suave Cary Grant and the striking Eva Marie Saint star in a movie that has all the elements we've come to expect from Hitch: mistaken identity, the intriguing blonde, murder, and deception.  And let's not forget the script, which is pregnant with witty one-liners and dodges cliches at all costs.  I wasn't around in 1959, but watching a movie like this in the theatre had to have been such an incredible experience.  You are literally hooked from the first frame.  The DVD itself is an attractive affair.  The picture is the best-looking I've ever seen in a Hitchcock movie.  In another review, I stated that ""Vertigo"" is the only film by Hitch available in 5.1 surround sound.  I was wrong!  ""N by NW"" is also in 5.1, and while the sound won't necessarily rock your system, it's a pretty decent soundtrack for a movie this old.  So, what are you waiting for?  I saw this on a friend's recommendation, and I'm kicking myself for not discovering it sooner.  ""North by Northwest"" is action filmmaking at its absolute peak and should not be missed.  I repeat: it's one of the greatest films of all time.",North by Northwest VHS

217992,"A person either likes this sort of thing or doesn't:  A big, old-fashioned Hollywood musical with terrific singing, splashy dancing, catchy tunes, attractive costuming, and, of course, a hackneyed, schmaltzy story on which to hang it all.

The rest of her commentary consists of chuckling, interminable pauses, trite gossip, and cheering on the characters onscreen (e.g. &quot;Way to go, Vera!&quot;).So only get the DVD if the movie itself is what you want in your collection.

236313,"...but you're the meanest!These words were spoken by LeRoy, the handyman, concerning the devilish 8-year-old Rhoda Penmark: murderer and penmanship champion wannabe.  And quite possibly the inspiration for Little House On the Prairie's Nellie Oleson.  Of course, that's just my own opinion.This little girl is mean indeed!  She's about as mean as they come.  After coming home from a school picnic in which her classmate has mysteriously drowned, Rhoda decides it's the perfect time for a tasty peanut butter sandwich and an enjoyable skate in the warm sunshine.  When LeRoy asks her how she can possibly be enjoying herself at such a time, she replies,""Why should I feel sorry?  It was Claude Dagel that got drowned, not me!""Don't expect any top-notch performances from this movie.  Most of the acting is way overdone, passing the characters off more as mere caricatures.  But this was a famous play before it was a famous movie (and a famous novel before either of those two), and, as I understand it, most of (if not all) the actors from the play were used in the movie as well.  There are a few good performances, like Mrs. Dagel, LeRoy, and at times even you-know-who.You-know-who is, of course, Rhoda Penmark, the only daughter of Colonel and Mrs. Penmark, and the center of the story.  Why is she referred to as ""the Bad Seed""?  Well, that expression in this film refers to a child who is born without a conscience, or without the ability to decipher between right and wrong; a child who is incapable of feeling any kind of remorse.And that's our girl!With Dad away on military business, Mom is left alone to raise up Rhoda in the way she ought to go, so that when she's older she will not depart from it (to use a Biblical reference).  But little by little, one by one, the hints of Rhoda's foul play start to close in on her mother.  But by the time Mom finds out about the evil lurking beneath Rhoda's disarming smile and innocent disposition it may be too late to redeem her daughter.  By then Mom might be in need of her own redemption.I've criticized the acting, I have no other complaints against this film.  The storyline is never dull and never boring.  Even if you're sharp enough to predict the outcome, you'll still enjoy the ride.  From the very beginning, the story builds and builds into what finally becomes a suspenseful climax.

She married Charles Hamiliton just to make Ashley jealous, but Ashley's only interested in Charles' sister, Melanie who married him. Later, as a widow, Scarlett meets Rhett Butler, who is really the ""true love"" of her life and she doesn't know it until it was too late at the end of the film.All through the film, there was the Civil War, famine, slaves, dying and dead soldiers lying on the streets of Atlanta (that pans out across the screen as Scarlett was looking for the doctor to deliver Melanie's baby), babies being born, deaths, and Scarlett's obsession over Ashley. Oh yes, Scarlett's self-centered ways appeared throughout the film as she married 2nd husband who was one of her sisters' fiance (she lied her way to marry him for money), and hiring slavery in her own lumber business. She obviously didn't care for the first two men she married, and didn't realize that Rhett is the real love of her life until after he said ""Frankly my dear, I don't give a damn"" at the end.

706716,"For some reason, the name Lucio Fulci makes me buy many and many a movie. Its something of an addiction really, one that I sometimes love (as with Zombie and House by the Cemetery), sometimes question (as with the movie New Gladiators), and sometimes sigh at as the accumulation gods force me to buy. This movie is one of the latter times, something to throw into that questionmark-bearing rollercoaster ride, with loops and curves hitting various highs and lows that can either evoke startled jumps and enamored looks as gore flashes across the screen or assails with yawns and frowns as the movie makes less and less sense. Then there's also the issue of the movie suddenly deciding to forego that somewhat overrated idea many call a plot altogether and bumble around to keep some characters alive.Its hard to fault Lucio for this problem, though, because he did pull out of the creation of this film before its completion after some storyline disagreements. In fact, the movie had to be finished by someone else altogether, and I had often wondered what these motivational factors were. Well, here's what I discovered.The beginning of the plot (the part that is coherent):The movie starts out in the most conventional of fashions. Doctors trying to perfect a bioweapon simply known as Death 1 gruesomely perfect a virus that can animate the dead and decide that the army needs to come in and safely remove a sample of it. On the way to the helicopter, a van full of lab-coat clad terrorists with guns that mysteriously fire sometimes and only make popgun sounds at others, temporarily steal the virus away. It costs all these men save one their lives, however, and the survivor is off with a metallic briefcase full of virus, pursuers in tow that have guns that suffer the same fate as the terrorist's guns did, plus a helicopter added to the fray for good measure. In the ensuing chase some rounds are fired from the sky, the terrorist is hit and the case is dropped and the vial containing the virus is broken. Thus the infection begins.The terrorist stumbles to a hotel, acquires himself a room and starts making a mess right away. After chopping off his hand for some unexplained reason (the virus originally infected him there, but it was showing everywhere else as well), he kills a bit, awaiting the government's reaction that comes in a swift and brutal fashion. Then, in a Return of the Living Dead manner, the infected body is burned and the atmosphere is infected. Enter our main characters, three army men and a camper full of five individuals, who are accosted by a flock of infected birds and subsequently must stop at the now defunct hotel. Here, they begin to make discoveries, horrid ones, about the fate that has quickly begun to take over the town in the most undead of manners, losing some members of their swollen party in the process.The plot thickens (hemorrhages, is spliced into a movie I somehow missed):After the killing starts, the movie begins to bumble around. The characters separate and run into the supposed zombies; beasts that sometimes shamble and sometimes run, ones that can use weapons and that hide like amusements inside of a haunted house. They seem frightening enough at first, eating and goring anything in sight, until it is discovered that they have a bit of a flaw. They die really easily. Yes, these mawing machines have a resistance to the atypical sharp/blunt weaponry, but hot lead claws through their ranks o so easily. Well, the plot bumbles some more, a new female character is introduced, and then they ban together for the last half of the movie's plot; fleeing. Still, amidst the fleeing, many things happen that really don't seem to make sense. For instance, a cleanup crew of government men that have been ordered to kill everyone run into two of our main characters and basically get into fisticuffs with them instead of simply mowing them down. Later, when the survivors are trying to escape, one of them yells that they are out of shells and that they'll have to make a run for it. This isn't the case later, however, as his gun seems to replenish itself, making me wonder what has just transpired. (And the list goes on and on)Basically, the beginning of the movie was really entertaining but, at the end, I couldn't fight back the yawning perplexion breeding in my head. If you want to see zombies with paper-thin resistance and some gore, I suppose you could watch it. Still, I'd advise you turn it off at the halfway marker.",Zombi 3
683510,"You have to hand it to director Tom Tykwer - he has come out with yet another wonderful film that once again brings him together with the lovely Franka Potente. The two of them together is magic. This time around, Franka plays Sissi, a nurse who works in a mental hospital. She is involved in a terrible accident, and her life is saved by the mysterious stranger Bodo. After he saves her life, he disappears, and suddenly Sissi becomes obsessed with tracking him down to thank him, and to ultimately become a part of his life. He of course wants nothing to do with her, but she is convinced that fate has something cooked up for the two of them. The one problem with this film, and the reason I only gave it 4 stars instead of 5, is that at times the movie seems long and a little slow. At more than 2 hours, that is expected. Some people didn't like it because they compared it to the other Tykwer/Potente film, &quot;Run Lola Run&quot; which was a shorter, faster-moving film. But this is one reason I like this one. No one wants to see the same thing twice. I think it's great Tykwer took a different direction with this film. &quot;The Princess and the Warrior&quot; is a more powerful, serious movie, that can stand to be viewed a couple of times.

530080,"Meet the Parents is, for me, happy confirmation that Hollywood can still make a terrific comedy that has broad appeal. I wish this would happen more often. Today much of the focus is on audiences between twelve and twenty-five years old. There is no denying that this is the age group that goes to the movies the most, and catering to it is appropriate. Still, the huge hits are almost always ones like Titanic and The Sixth Sense whose appeal is to a much broader age range. This is why Meet the Parents has been so successful. There are things in it a twelve-year old can enjoy, but it is equally entertaining to someone who is sixty.Greg [Ben Stiller] is a highly competent nurse who is head-over-heels in love with Pam Burnes [Teri Polo], a school teacher. He sets up an elaborate marriage proposal for her, but in the middle of it, she not only announces that her sister is engaged, but also exclaims that she is thrilled that her sibling's fiance asked her father's permission first. Greg, who is as insecure as they come, decides not to propose just yet. He will please Pam and her family by waiting to talk to dear old Dad. The opportunity comes when the couple goes from Chicago to New York to attend the sister's wedding.Have you ever been in a situation where nothing you do or say works? That's what Greg encounters when he finally meets the parents. Mother Dina [Blythe Danner] is amiable enough, but father Jack [Robert DeNiro] is, to say the least, a challenge. It isn't that he is heartless or mean. It's that he is ferociously protective of his family, especially of his favorite, Pam. You know the type. No man has ever been good enough for his little Pammy. Making Jack even more formidable is his former profession. He's a retired CIA agent. Ferreting out the truth was his job. The house if full of spy cams, and Jack even owns his own polygraph machine. He just can't let go of these toys or of the spy mentality Then there is the family cat. It's a gorgeous Himalayan that is Jack's favorite pet of all time. Jack says it can never go out side because it has no survival skills. This is a comedy, and, of course, someone lets the cat out. You can guess who manages to do that. And in this comedy of disasters, this is only a small part of Greg's problems.Robert DeNiro, who has shown himself to be a natural in comedies lately, and Ben Stiller, always good for a lot of laughs, play off each other as if they have been a comedy team for years. Blythe Danner is amusing as Mom, and Teri Polo is appropriately sweet and lovable as Pam. Almost stealing the movie is Owen Wilson as Kevin, as Pam's flamboyant, millionaire ex-fiance. Director Jay Roach originally envisioned Kevin as a jock type, but Wilson put his own spin on the character, as he always does. The results are hysterically funny. Near the end of the movie, watch for Kali Rocha, whose interpretation of an airline employee from hell should have you rolling on the floor with laughter.Meet the Parents is an example of a hit that almost wasn't. There were constant rewrites throughout the shoot. DeNiro and Danner were brought back to reshoot the ending, as was Polo to add a new opening. This movie is an example of how persistence can pay off, and, in this case, pay off big time.",N/A

705798,"I've never been a soldier or visited Vietnam, but I had the feeling when I watched this movie that this is probably what it was like for our soldiers.The film begins in 1965 when Lt. Colonel Hal Moore, of the U. S. Air Calvary is sent to Vietnam with his 400 newly trained soldiers.  They're landed by helicopters right in the middle of a firefight and the men jump out of the helicopters immediately having to defend their lives.

The Americans were virtually surrounded and facing enemy soldiers who were seasoned and knew the terrain. There's realism about this film that makes the viewer see the true brutality of the battlefield.Mel Gibson in the role of Moore did an excellent job of portraying a man who cared about his soldiers and wasn't too mucho to let them know.  Greg Kinnear in the part of a helicopter pilot and Sam Elliot as a tough career sergeant major were both terrific in their roles.

19932,"This eye-catching Darren Stein teen satire caught MY eye several times while flipping channels, but I'd never caught the film from the beginning.  Finally, I watched it from beginning to end,  and I enjoyed it so much, I watched it again.Rose McGowan plays Courtney Shayne, a viciously hateful head of a 4 girl highschool clique.  All four are beautiful, stylish, spoiled and naturally, cool with  capital ""C"".  There's cohort Julie Benz as Marcy Fox aka ""Foxy""  (her neckplate states), she is a stereotypic ""dumb blonde"" unquestionably following Courtney's rules.  Rebecca Gayheart plays Julie Freedman.  She's a wholesome, sweet girl looking for fun, and friendship.The movie opens fabulously as the three girls  disguise themselves, and break into their friends bedroom on her birthday.  They figure they'll ""Feed her pancakes, and strip her... (ect.)"", and they'll all have fun giving her an unexpected surprise.  We come upon the unusual title of the film, when Courtney brutally stuffs a ""Jawbreaker"" golfball size candy into her mouth and then duct tapes it shut.  The three then throw her in the trunk of the car.  When they arrive at their destination, the trunk opens again, to reveal a far bigger suprise than the one they planned. Their friend is suffocated, eyes wide, dismayed, and unmistakably dead.  All this in the first 5 minutes!!The three girls react in totally different ways.  ""Foxy"" freaks, Julie wants to tell someone and get help, and Courtney, being the leader, decides coldly and calculatingly to cover it all up.  They take the friends body back home to the bed where they kidnapped her from, and try to make it look like murder.  While the three argue about what to do, into the house walks nerd Fern Mayo (Judy Greer).  While delivering homework to the now dead classmate she has secretly idolized, she overhears what happened, and see's the body.  To shut her up, Courtney offers her a makeover, a new identity, and passport to chic and cool to rule the school.  From a pact with the devilish Courtney, ""Violet"" is born.  After all, Fern is a Plant, so Violet is a Flower, according to Courtney's logic.  Violet, now the new mysteriously cool chick everyone wants to know better, comes to overshadow Courtney's established cool rule, and all the more deliciously bitchy trouble begins.This movie is a true masterpiece in the teen genre realm.  It touches on similar ground with ""Heathers"" as well as Keanu Reeves early effort ""River's Edge.""  It's not laugh out loud hilarious, but it is most definitely, a black satire.  There are amusing cameos from Carol Kane as a slightly indignant teacher, and speaking of ""Foxy"", the old 1970s ""Foxy Brown"", Pam Grier is terrifically dour and surly as a detective hilariously named Vera Cruz.Besides the highly amusing and watchable cast, the film is such a visually attractive treat as well.  The vividly sharp candy colors, and frequently surrealistic moods and moments in the cinematography, create even more of an offbeat and quirky feel, than the plot alone delivers.All this and an outstanding soundtrack with the perfect song for every scene (the slow motion school hallway saunter of the three leads to ""Yoo-Hoo"" from Imperial Teen is my favorite) further takes this up yet ANOTHER notch,  making ""Jawbreaker"" a must see, as well as a must hear!",N/A
371984,"This movie has all the makings of a winner.  A plot that is identifiable to almost any moviegoer, (everybody knows somebody in this situation.)A cast consisting of a fine comic lead, good supporting characters and two Hollywood legends.  And a script that fits each actor like a glove.John Candy pleases in this low key role of a lonely police officer tied too tight to his mother (O'Hara) who has very strong opinons about almost everything and who plays the mother guilt card like no other as he is pursuing his interest in an equally lonely lady (Sheedy).  I watched this with my own mother who is O'Hara's age and saw her nodding in agreement all over the film. (until her full blooded Siclian fists clenched when O'Hara's character described us.  The look on her face was worth the price of the movie alone.)The story is plesant and worth your money, Candy &amp; O'Hara work well together (who would have thought she would outlive him!)  but the real power of the film is her interaction with Anthony Quinn.  Classic film buffs like myself will get a real charge out of Quinn once again persuing O'Hara, but this time without an Errol Flynn as a rival.  That sub plot is at least as interesting as the main one and for my money is better.  It is classic Maureen O'Hara, the strong woman who is chased by the strong man and frankly is a great contrast to the the exact opposite situation between Candy &amp; Sheedy.In the end to nobodys surprise love conquers all and Candy's final immagined scene (contrasting with several ones eariler in the film) gives him closure.  That final scene is my favorite and show O'Hara playing a character she has always excelled at.  Considering the events of 9/11/01 the ending has even more meaning as we see a member of &quot;The Greatest Generation&quot; setting an example (albert a fictious one) that would be bravely followed in reality 10 years later.I've said little about the good performances by Sheedy and Belushi, not to mention several other supporting characters in minor roles, they all add to the picture, but the stars make this film.

706311,"First let me begin by saying that making THE JEFFERSONS available in DVD format was a great idea. The early seasons may be my favorite seasons. I just loved Mother Jefferson, the show wasn't the same after the actress that played her passed away and her character was written out of the series. I grew up watching THE JEFFERSONS and have seen all the episodes so many times that I know practically all the lines for each episode. I've noticed that in recent years that tv stations, including TV LAND, delete a couple of minutes from each episode to make way for more commercials. This ticks me off!!! I can understand why movies that were made for the theater need to be trimmed down to accommodate commercials but why trim down a show that was made to be aired with commercials. Also, it seems that when airing THE JEFFERSONS that networks are working with old film. The broadcast picture is grainy. I find it difficult to watch the re-runs of this show due to it's trimmed content and grainy picture.This DVD solves all these problems. It has a clear picture with good colors and IT HAS THE ENTIRE SHOW, at least for the first season. I hope they continue to release the remaining seasons. I've noticed that more and more shows are being released in season format. This is great!! I envision a day when I won't have to watch trimmed reruns of my favorite tv shows ever again.Now for the complaint. While this DVD is cheaper than ALL IN THE FAMILY (season 1) which also has 13 episodes I think it could have been a little cheaper still considering it has no special features. I would be willing to pay the additional $'s to purchase a well put together package like the one done for THE MARY TYLER MORE SHOW (season 1). I think it would be great to have special features that included interviews with the remaining cast members. Let's face it none of the actors are spring chickens anymore. The actors & actresses that portrayed George, Lousise, Tom, Mr. Bentley, Florence and Ralph are all in their late 60's to early 80's. The actress that portrayed Helen has already passed on. Even the actress & actors that portrayed Jenny and Lionel (both of them) are in their 50's. The longer they wait to interview these people the more likely it is that they will not all be around to be interviewed. Also, the episodes don't play one after the other. When one episode is finished the DVD defaults to the menu screen. I would have like the option that would allow the viewer to watch all the episodes back to back. So while I would have liked to give this DVD a 5 star rating I had to deduct a star due to the lack of special features and additional features.Lastly, for those who don't quite know all the words to the opening theme song the words are printed on the inside of the DVD cover.",The Jeffersons - The Complete First Season

199192,"Clint Eastwood starred and directed this `1971 fatal attraction.' Eastwood is a late-night DJ that has one fan that just can't get enough of him.  The film is based on a true story of a women stalker whose flair-ups are scarier than Glenn Close in Fatal Attraction.  Watching this film I found myself wishing she would just go away. She drove me crazy! The character of Evelyn Draper was develop and portrayed very well by Jessica Walker.  She is very suffocating and what a temper.  The way Walker stalks Eastwood would frighten anyone!  There's enough suspense for any viewer. It's not the caliber of Fatal Attraction (#15 on my Top 20 Films), but if Fatal is the benchmark, and there are a lot of similarities like, girl meets guy in bar, girl stalks him, girl cuts her wrists, the restaurant scene, man's regret for crossing the line and the confrontation. What's the best line in the movie? When Eastwood turns to the police sergeant McCallum and said, ""what she needs is psychiatric help,"" and McCallum replies, ""really!""

104773,"After the success of Hammer's The Curse of Frankenstein in 1957, they decided to take the next logical step and remake Dracula. Released in 1958, Dracula (U.S. title The Horror of Dracula), reunited the very same cast and crew and The Curse of Frankenstein and created the formula that would carry Hammer's success throughout the 60's and 70's. Christopher Lee's portrayal of Dracula was so definitive that people pictured him in their minds when they thought of Dracula, a typecast that he was never quite able to escape. His Dracula--tall, dark, lips glossed with bright red blood--virtually revolutionized the horror film industry.To update the film, Hammer used not only eye-popping Technicolor, but added the sexual element, not clearly pictured in previous versions. This was the first vampire film where the female victims actually seemed to be enjoying the process. Peter Cushing, as Van Helsing, compared vampirism to drug addiction, and Hammer furthered the theme into realms of disease and madness in later films.The script, by Hammer's favorite screenwriter Jimmy Sangster, streamlined the key elements of the Bram Stoker novel, taking only a few liberties along the way. Probably the main change was Jonathon Harker, who knew the score from the start and arrived at Dracula's castle posing as a librarian, but intending to play the role of vampire slayer. This doesn't quite work out for him, and quickly swinging back into novel territory, he meets up with Dracula's three concubines.Horror of Dracula is widely considered to be Hammer's best Vampire film. I'm not quite sure that I agree with this (give me Captain Kronos or Twins of Evil over this one any day...) considering that they built a whole genre starting with this film and took it in some wild and previously unheard of directions. It is Hammer's most faithful adaptation from an original work, and it's notable as the beginning of something big.The DVD release has a few extras-not many and nothing I'd never seen before elsewhere. There is a notable mistake on the packaging. The woman on the back is Stephanie Beachum, in her role as Jessica Van Helsing in Hammer's Dracula: AD 1972, when they decided to bring the Count into the then ""modern age."" Ooops! Maybe whoever designed the case didn't actually watch the film.The release seems somewhat minimal and casual, but it's definitely worth picking up. While I'm slightly disappointed with the lack of extras, (and by the cheesy packaging blurbs and picture mistakes), I am very grateful to be able to have it on DVD!",N/A

671761,"Buy this movie!  Seriously, it is one of the best movies I have ever seen, and most of my friends and family fully support that opinion.  So take a chance and buy it!Reese Witherspoon makes a steller performance as Elle Woods, a drop-dead gorgeous blonde, ditzy as can be, who basically comes to one day and decides to attend Harvard Law School.  Why?  Because becoming a law student is the only way to win back the love of Warner Huntington III (played by hunk Matthew Davis).  And suprisingly, she manages to convince the Harvard admittance committee that her brains . . . or assets . . . will make her an excellent addition to the school.  Once she gets to Harvard, however, Elle is shocked to learn that everyone does NOT love her.  She faces hard classes for which she is expected to prepare, a professor who tosses her out of class, and finally discovers that Warner got engaged over the summer to a preppy Eastern girl.  But Elle is up to the challenge, rocketing to stardom even as a 1L (first-year law student to those not in the club).My 5-star recommendation comes from my love of a good lawyer joke, and the ability to laugh at our profession.  And this movie definitely does that.  You get to see that law school is filled with tough classes, hard profs, nasty law students, and stretching one to one's limits.  But you also see a woman with a truly good heart rise above all the pettiness she faces, and succeed by being true to herself.  A truly enjoyable time for everyone watching.",Legally Blonde
590523,"A Beautiful Mind is not a great movie, certainly not 2001's best film, but it's a respectable effort from director Ron Howard, and especially writer Akiva Goldsman, who was partially responsible for the travesty that was Batman and Robin. This biographical drama focuses on the life of John Nash, the genius who developed a radical concept on game theory. I'd rather not say further about the story, since there's a big plot twist halfway through that definitely puts a spin on much of the material that came before it.As most have heard, A Beautiful Mind is largely inaccurate in its depiction of John Nash's life. Did I really care? Not particularly. I'd be a fool to expect a film based on facts to adhere entirely to the truth. Rather, I'm basing my opinion on how well-crafted the movie is, and how well it succeeded on what it was trying to be, that is, a film meant to inspire with its theme of love (and besides, I seriously doubt all the indiscretions of Nash's life would mesh well with that, so I'm wondering if the film's detractors really want to see all of Nash's odd behavior portrayed or if they're just looking for something to complain about). So how does this film come across as a feel good drama? Not bad.First off, I'd like to mention that Ron Howard's direction and Goldsman's screenwriting are easily the film's weakest points, and not deserving of the Oscars they received. As has been evident in previous works, Howard is not a master of subtlety, and as best as he tries, he obviously doesn't have a firm grasp of what's genuinely good drama. A lot of the film's emotional moments are overdone and pure Hollywood; there's typical shouting, crying, and glass-breaking, nothing I haven't seen before.  While I have a lot to complain about Howard's direction, he's fine when it comes to pacing and style, and yes, the film itself does look very lovely and polished.Definitely by far the film's weakest segment is in the last ten or so minutes, when we witness Nash age and receive his nobel prize. That alone doesn't sound so awful, but unfortunately, we get a speech that lamely hammers home the movie's message, that of how we must rely on emotion and love over cold intellect to solve our problems and survive in this world. It had already seemed obvious that was what the film had been striving to say throughout its rather lengthy running time, and I sure as hell didn't need Howard to blindly forcefeed the theme in such a manner.Since I've done nothing but complain up to this point, you might wonder why it is I consider this film above average. The answer's simple. This all works thanks to Russell Crowe as John Nash and Jennifer Connelly as his wife, particularly the latter, who delivers a magnificent performance worthy of far more screen time (it's all the more disappointing to see that we never even find out what she does for a living, considering she was the one supporting Nash in his later, troubled years). Crowe is in very fine form in the lead, both sympathetic and likeable, though some of his tics seem more like obvious attempts at acting rather than genuine eccentric behavior.Schizophrenia is a disease that's dealt with in the film. I've never studied up much on it, though on my paltry knowledge alone, I probably know far more than most Hollywood (most often, as in the case with Me, Myself, and Irene, filmmakers seem to think schizophrenia is just another term for multiple identity disorder). (moderate spoiler) I don't know how accurate A Beautiful Mind's portrayal of this mental illness is, but the Nash in the movie hardly seems like a true ""loony,"" and the film makes the disease seem a bit easier to handle than it probably is (Nash sees a few people who aren't there, and at one point, even reasons that they can't be there). Much like the rest of the film, the handling of this topic feels Hollywood, but also like the rest of the film, it's handled competently and in a fairly riveting fasion.*** 1/2 out of *****",N/A

Lemmon's work really makes the movie, though the cast of stars (Alec Baldwin, Al Pacino, Ed Harris, Alan Arkin, Kevin Spacey and Jonathan Pryce) is uniformly excellent. And, through Mamet's screenplay, each is given an opportunity to have at least one powerhouse scene, particularly Baldwin, who appears only in the beginning 10 minutes of the film.With a cast that talented, it's good that they're all given moments to shine.The plot of the film is beside the point, really. Much of the ""action"" that drives the plot, including the pivotal robbery of the office, occurs off-screen.

66121,"What's missing from this film is the signature Hitchcockian soundtrack that accompanies his mysteries so well -- in fact, it's so hard to think of an Alfred Hitchcock film without frequent collaborator Bernard Hermmann's score that this was the first thing I noticed (Hermmann is actually still credited as a ""sound consultant""). Instead Hitch once again shows his brilliance is channeling fear to his audience by relying on good old-fashioned cinematic tricks -- this one, by allowing an overwhelming cacophony of bird caws wash over the picture every time you expect the music to help you ride the waves of thrills. Just as effective.I once read that Hitch never wanted to make thrillers; he considered his movies ""mysteries"" (so it's to his credit that his mysteries still contain so many thrills, giving his audience the best of both worlds), so I accepted the rather abrupt ending graciously. There isn't even the ""The End"" typical of movies in this era, giving a sense of unending terror. Sure enough, we don't know if they ever get rid of the birds, we don't know why the birds attacked.Although we do know that it may never happen, the attack scenes are frightening, so that you start allowing yourself the pleasure of the disbelief.

Not really that scary, I guess it had its moments but like I said it is exciting and loaded with tons of surprises,and this is when Bruce starts coming up with his famous quotes.Well as far as my theory goes for this being so similar to the first one, its like after Bruce stopped the curse on the first one, the demon knocked him like well back in time if you will. Like a bad dream and made his memory forget everything. Like it showed a glimpse of the demon doing that in this one.That or it was just made to make no sense whatsoever kind of sequel. Anyway the special effects well some of them are really good, yet others are really dumb but I guess back when this movie came out the effects were pretty damn good.

Frankly after watching Scared to Death -- the film truly looks like a masterpiece -- and truth be told it isn't that bad. in fact, it is rather enjoyable. OK I am gonna admit it -- I like it! If you look past the cheesy octopus (no worse than the hysterical devil bat), the cheap sets and the lame acting (better than Scared to Death!), if you suspend a little disbelief and realize this movie was made for a song -- then actually it is pretty darned good. One reason for this is that Bela Lugosi gets ample screen time and if Ed Wood was a bit unimaginative he at least knew what it was that made Lugosi a legend and reprises little details from the mad scientific leering of the Devil Bat to the idiosyncratic hand gestures of White Zombie.Bela is given a chance to shine in his final speaking performance and shine he does. The movie has its flaws, but Bela is not one of them. He is old and looks weak, but he carries the movie like a true champion. He makes empty dialog sound meaningful and implausible scenarios seem poignant (well almost poignant).Bela's ""I have no home"" monolog is beautiful. He could make dialog such as ""I have proven that I am alright!"" sound good. Lugosi gives his all in his last performance, and it is a great performance, even if he does have to wrestle with a fake octopus.",N/A
697652,"An artist takes a big risk when they divert from their normal musical style.  Madonna did it with ""I'm Breathless"" and George Michael did it with ""Songs from the Last Century.""  Now it is British megastar Robbie Williams' turn to show his swing skills as he performs classics from his album ""Swing When You're Winning.""First of all, the album itself is great. If you are a fan and you don't have it, pay the import prices and have a listen.  This DVD shows his live concert at decadent Royal Albert Hall.  He has a full orchestra and dresses the part in a suave suit.  His performance never misses a beat.  He covers the classics with the greatest of ease.  He is an excellent live performer anyway, but it's nice to see him toned down a bit from his over-the-top pop concerts.  He duets with the likes of Jon Lovitz, Jane Horrocks (from ""Little Voice""), and Rupert Everett.  Highlight number: ""Mack the Knife.""  But don't think Robbie has forgotten who he is. In between songs, he does get a bit cheeky with a few jokes.Only downside?  He did not perform ""Somethin' Stupid,"" his duet with Nicole Kidman (but she was in the audience...hmmmmmm).  Luckily, the song's music video and a making-of special are featured on the DVD.Also featured on the DVD is a little documentary called ""The Day Job.""  It follows Robbie through his videography and achievements.  It was an interesting touch.This is a must-have if you are a Robbie fan or a swing fan, or if you simply want to discover what the British are fussing about.  He truly is one of the best talents today.",N/A

I watched it, and I loved it. This movie really makes you think about life, and you also wonder why it wasn't a big successful movie, maybe it was too &quot;hardcore&quot; and &quot;real&quot; for that time era. This was the beginning of the Golden Age of Hollywood so they wanted all the movies to look perfect with a happy ending, with dancing, and singing, and leg showing, and a little bit of crying, but ends happily. This movie doesn't have all that, But this is worth a watch. Some of you who are Bette Davis fans may be a little disappointed because she doesn't have leading role, and she not as dramatic as her future movies, but this movie is worth the watch. For being a 64 minute movie, it sure has a lot of different situations and keeps you wanting more, I wish they could of added maybe 30 minutes more. Movies today should be like that, Directors and Producers should watch movies like this, you don't have to make long 3 or 4 hour movies to make a good one, this movie was 64 minutes and it was good, it kept us wanting more, that's what movies should be like, leave you wanting more, not leaving saying I wish I would of saved my 5.00 or 6.00 or 7.00 dollars.

86224,"This is definitely Kubrick's darkest film. The performances given by Vincent D'Onofrio, Matthew Modine, and R. Lee Ermy stand out and give this beautiful film it's surreal, depressing mood. But of all of them, Vincent D'Onofrio stands out the most with his heartbreaking performance as Private Leonard Pyle. As I write this review, the thing that sticks in my mind is that one scene in which Pyle shoots Drill Sergeant Hartman and then himself.And, of course, Kubrick's use of light, space, and camera movement make this another one of his darker films. This film would best be described as a mix of Apocalypse Now and Taxi Driver, in terms of atmosphere and lighting, as well as some elements of plot.

605314,"Spielberg opens his holiday offering with a narrative frame of his protagonist appearing on an episode of ""To Tell the Truth,"" intercutting shots of DiCaprio with 30-year-old footage of ""guest"" Kitty Carlisle and ""host"" Joe Garagiola from the actual television show. A nice device for ""motivating"" the story and establishing a sense of place and ""realness""--but also one that sets up an expectation in the audience: will Kitty make the right call?Spielberg's script never returns to this framing moment. A small detail perhaps, but this film, like most of Spielberg's work, takes great pride in the details, the verisimilitude of time and place--from Nehi pop bottles to Mitch Miller's television show to the continuous use on the soundtrack of popular music hits of the day. The problem is not so much that many of these details are anachronisms, or just sufficiently ""off"" to be bothersome, but that the slowness of plotting and thinness of characterization allowed me to dwell on them in the first place.  Hanks' role calls for him to be a straight-arrow caricature with his face upstaged by large glasses and his deportment deferring to his padded mid-section; DiCaprio, too, is about surfaces, incapable of suggesting any of the addictive giddiness of the successful imposter or con artist.  The biggest surprise in the film may well be the nuanced, sensitive performance of Christopher Walken who, as Frank's blustering, conning father, is at once wholly believable and sympathetic.The film will no doubt do decent business. Not only is it a star vehicle for two of the screen's biggest attractions but Spielberg pulls on all of the middle-class family-value strings that are his trademark, and he combines the genre of the loveable imposter with that of the persevering bounty hunter who bonds with his praiseworthy prey. Moreover, unlike George W. and Osama, Hanks gets his man. But at 2 hours and 20 minutes the film feels like it owes us more--at the very least the satisfaction of knowing whether Kitty Carlisle got her man.",Catch Me If You Can

I can't tell you which scene was the most touching, there were too many. I can say, however, be prepared to laugh and cry (okay - the ""piano scene"" and the ""drag queen in the bathroom"" scene are outrageously funny.) And although the characters never actually have explicit sex in the film, there is plenty of palpable sexuality and sensuality between them from start to finish.

704962,"This video is more of a workout than Dolphina's intro to bellydance-- which is as expected since this is for the &quot;warrior goddess&quot; as opposed to the beginning goddess.  The moves are much harder to master (I'm a little rusty and plan to go back to the beginner for a refresher now).  Focuses some on the &quot;core&quot; abdominal muscles-- perhaps a little Pilates style coaching.  I definitely felt my abs being stretched!  The focus/direction in this video allow the viewer to see *all* of the whole body's movements--not just head &amp; shoulder shots.  Sometimes Dolphina does go a bit fast in &quot;how to&quot; do the movement-- you'll have to think about it and practice the moves a number of times before mastery.  Keep your clicker handy &amp; rewind and pause.  It'll give you more workout time, anyway-- and we all know you need at least 20 minutes of workout till you get that fatburning anyway!The set is gorgeous and interesting; I always wonder where they find these places-- Dolphina is great, too, but (yay) gone are the &quot;cheesier&quot; aspects of video one, those superimposed shots of Dolphina's head (a la Debbie does Dallas).The routine &amp; cool down do, however, feature two new bellydance costumes that can give you some ideas for your own costuming.  (For those of us addicted to the clothing/fashion of bellydance too).  During the rest of the video, Dolphina's clothing is more what you would wear to a bellydance class, as opposed to a performance.I only gave this one four stars because it is definitely not for beginners, and I felt I would have liked to be able to hear more of the middle eastern music that goes with this style of dance.  But that's just being really picky on my part.  I also think it's going to be much harder for most people to master, so you'll want to get another bellydance video first if you're just starting out.But primarily, for intermediate to advance bellydancers, this will give you much more of a workout and fatburning once mastered.  It's worth being part of your collection-- anything to keep the fitness video boredom from setting in!Still, even the best video will never replace an in-person instructor.

597574,"After reading a string of reviews from people who had never seen Die Another Day (hey thanks!), I wanted to see it anyway. Who can say no to James Bond? Every Bond movie comes down to action, setting, girls, cars and gadgets, so we might as well rate it based on these.Action: almost frantic, for 2 1/2 hours. Hovercraft chases, car chases, a riveting sword fight, gun fights in aircraft, gun fights in an ice palace, car gadget fights on ice, etc. -- you get the idea. If you liked Driving Miss Daisy, this isn't your flick. But Bond is Bond, and somehow it works. The action crowds out almost all character development, but I would recommend the old Ian Fleming books if you want to explore that side of the most famous secret agent.Setting: Gritty North Korean military camps, Cuba and an especially arctic portrayal of Iceland. I always like to leave a Bond movie feeling like I've vacationed in a few spots. Die Another Day works. A gorgeous movie on the big screen.Girls: Two love interests, Halle Berry being the more interesting interest. Nothing too risque in the sex scenes, so bring the kids if they're already accustomed to the violence. The dialogue is atrociously corny, one one-liner after another. Brosnan can get away with it. Berry won't be winning any awards for this. Sean Connery and Timothy Dalton were darker. Roger Moore was always rather flip. Brosnan seems to have edged toward the Bond-as-wiseacre in Die Another Day.Cars: An A++. Was there ever anything better than an Aston Martin for 007? The gorgeous Vanquish (with invisibility, rockets, and the other options you won't find at your local Jag dealer...) is perfect Bond, updated. Berry's Thunderbird makes the briefest appearance, and gets upstaged by everything else. It felt like a commercial spot (shock!). Lots of Land Rovers, as Ford gets its money's worth, and a diabolocial Jaguar Racing Green XKR convertible with rocket launchers -- well, you get the idea. A tad high on the commercial aspect, but not ruinously so.Gagdets -- John Cleese is wonderful as Q, even if the late Desmond Llewelyn will always be Q. I won't spoil it for you, but watch for some older Bond props. Bond's new ring, watch and the accessories on his Aston Martin are marvelous. You cringe knowing the car will never make through the film.Overall, Bond fans will love this. Students of cinema won't. The plot isn't much, the dialogue often weak and the characters thin. The title song was vapid compared to almost any Bond title I can remember. It may be the worst one yet -- pop candy with a hint of rap. No reason to avoid modern artists, but this one doesn't work. David Arnold's score usually does, with many cues borrowed directly from The World is Not Enough (really a very good soundtrack) and even a snippet of 'London Calling', in case Bond ever listened to The Clash.How can I not recommend James Bond? Leave reality behind for a couple of hours and have fun.",Die Another Day
185440,"This is the definitive collection. There are a few shortcomings, but they by no means detract from the overall package. You do get every SHR song (so they say) and the ability to play them in just about any combination you want, which pretty much sums up disc 1. You also get a wonderful documentary on disc 2 that is mainly about the new song, but also touches on some SHR history. There are some challenging trivia games and other oddities included as well, making this a well-rounded archive, but there are some curious omissions.I'll unpack ""frustrating"" first. There is a top 20 list of SHR songs on disc 2, presumably from the on-line vote prior to this collection's release. Why not list all 46 with their vote totals/percentages? Why is this list on disc 2 and not on disc 1 as a play list option? There are also some fairly interesting (but not too revealing) commentaries for a couple of handfuls of tunes on disc 2. Why are these commentaries not on disc 1, and why not for all of the songs? Only 3 of the original 4 Scooter Computer songs are included, and the long-lost ""Weather Show"" is obviously edited. A history of the failed Scooter Computer series would have been nice, as would an explanation of why the ""Weather Show"" was pulled from circulation and then edited for this release. These items were omitted, but the Nike commercial was included? What were they thinking?!Don't let my griping turn you off.

693835,"I'm not sure I have ever been as let down watching a movie as I was with this one.  Contrary to what everyone seems to be saying, it is NOT better than The Phantom Menace.  I have to wonder if we didn't get to see Yoda ""in action"" if people would still think Attack of the Clones was so great.  The main problem with this movie is that it completely depends on knowlege of the original trilogy.  Granted most people who see the new movies are probably fans of the original, but that doesn't make it okay to completely ignore good storytelling.  The truth is there is not much to tell.  Everyone knows what's going to happen.  We have all imagined what went on before A New Hope.  When I think about it, the new trilogy is really pointless.  The new trilogy creates holes in the original trilogy.  Why would Obi Wan hide Luke on Tatooine after everything that happened. Not to mention that Tatooine is supposed to be a desolate planet.  The new series makes it seem like the hot spot of the universe.  And what about Anakin and Obi-Wan being good friends?  There is absolutely no fondness between them.  And Anakin being a great Jedi before he turned?  Why don't we get to see any of this?  Attack of the Clones is so devoid of emotion.  We wouldn't have any idea of Anakin's and Padme's feeling for one another except that they say so (in the most expressionless way possible).  There is just no chemistry between any of the characters.George Lucas has obviously forgotten the concept of less is more.  There was just too much digital creation, it almost felt like watching a cartoon.  To evoke Dr. Malcolm in Jurassic Park, they were so concerned with whether they could do something, they didn't stop to think if they should.  There seemed to be many elements that were only there to show off digital technology than advance the story. The overall look of the film at times was very grainy, and some of the backgrounds looked like paintings.  It seemed like so many creatures and backgrounds had to be crammed in that nothing was used to its full potential.  Like the planet of water, Kamino, barely anytime was spent there.  All of the creatures were briefly spotligted instead of focused on.  There was nothing to develop a relationship with, especially when you think of how well planets like Hoth and Endor were used in the originals.I did like the scene between Obi-Wan, Anakin, Count Dooku and (a little later) Yoda.  It reminded me of what Star Wars really should be.  I'm not sure we actually needed to see Yoda with a light saber, but it was okay.  I actually wanted to see Anakin with the two light sabers a little longer.  Overall, however, it was probably the best scene in the movie.I have no hope left for Episode III.  It would be good if Lucas got better help with scriptwriting.  Maybe the characters and relationships could be developed a little more, and the lame jokes left out.  I won't criticize the actors for ""bad performances"" because I truly don't think they are at fault.  They are the victims of bad screenwriting and lazy directing.  Or maybe it's that the director has become so obsessed with his special effects everything else is secondary.  Maybe he should just make Episode III fully animated.",N/A
515371,"This film is the perfect counterpoint to Leone's &quot;Once Upon a Time in the West,&quot; which rewards the patient viewer with a slowly unfolding mythic tale that ends up transcending both the American and Spaghetti western genres.  Corbucci, as always, is an impatient director, beginning his film not with an interminable wait for a train, but with a simple image of a gunfighter hauling a coffin and saddle (most people forget that little detail) behind him through a muddy wasteland.  Enzo Barboni's exquisite camerawork and Luis Bacalov's witty score punctuates this frenetic, modest film.  If it weren't for the literally dozens of interchangeable villains (Corbucci has Major Jackson's cretins wear red scarves seemingly so Django and the audience can tell bystanders from bad guys), this probably wouldn't have been such an influential film in Europe.  But the extremity of the violence, combined with the comic-book style stunt-work and photography (John Woo points to Peckinpah as a major influence, but one has to wonder how many times he watched Corbucci, too!), is probably what made it such a phenomenon.  There's art to this movie--but an art diametrically opposed to Leone's works.  For whereas Leone is all suspense--a series of build-ups and crescendi, almost classical in their orientation, concluding with a final, overwhelmingly tense battle--Corbucci seems always in a hurry to get on to the *next* battle.  Men fall like ten-pins; bullets fly thick as a swarm of bees; and it's all over usually before any level of suspense ever begins to build.  Only the concluding scene, with the mysterious Django struggling to use his beloved's (?) cemetery cross as a desperate replacement for his mangled hands, gestures to anything more than the sum of the film's parts.  Great fun for those who don't mind a &quot;Wild Bunch&quot;-like bodycount to go with a whole lot of style but not a whole lot of substance.",Django & Django Strikes Again
20845,"Arlington Road is a paranoid thriller, which means that the main character is paranoid (but usually correct) about the movie's villain.

His new neighbor Oliver Lang (Tim Robbins) becomes his friend after Faraday saves his kid's life one day.  But after a while, Faraday begins to notice odd occurences with Lang.  I'll stop there because I don't want to give too much away.The acting in this movie is astounding, and Robbins once again plays a great two-faced character (I say again because I saw Antitrust first, even though that was made later).  The only downside is that the ending leaves you wondering what happens next.

230569,"How wonderful it is to have this unique movie beautifully restored to its original length and scene order by the British Film Institute.Until about ten years ago, I had never seen this film. I had never rented the cut, reconfigured tape, because I didn't think I'd like the film (in any form). But the L.A. County Museum of Art had an Archers' retrospective several years ago that included the BFI restoration print. Despite many of there pictures being among my favorites, I still thought I was in for a hoary WW II propaganda film. I could walk if I didn't like it.Was I ever wrong. I came out considering it among The Archers best works. which in my book, means one of the finest films ever.""The Life and Death of Colonel Blimp,"" in the original version, is a brilliant mix of WW II propaganda, an often whimisical loving satire of the system. It is ultimately one of the most winning anti-war films ever. In a different way, as good as ""Grand Illusion.""This low-key epic begins with the Boer War, when Blimp is a young (too) gung-ho officer to the time the film was made--mid-war 1943. The cast is superb. Roger Livesey gives one of the best performances imaginable. Deborah Kerr (18) at the time, gives a tour-de-force performance as the three different women Blimp falls for in the 40-year span of the film. Anton Walbrook Is so brilliant in this film. This man I am now convinced was one of the greatest actors of the 20th Century. His controversial character is a German officer Blimp befriends in the Boer War and they become life-time friends, with Blimp vouching for him being permitted to stay in England during WW II. Walbrook's scene explaining why he has left Germany is as great, if not greater than his curtain speech in ""Red Shoes."" Most other actors would have turned this into maudlin sentimentality. Walbrook instead gave me a giant lump in my throat. I don't lump easily.If you've never seen the complete, uncut and untampered with film and are Archers devotee, this is the version for you.The extras are uniformly fine. The commentary track with Martin Scorsesse and director Michael Powell, from a recording he made on first viewing the restored film, is sharp and perceptive. He sounds very old and can be hard to understand because of it, but it is worth the extra effort to hear him comment on one of his personal favorites.There is also an excellent half-hour or so documentary, that includes Emeric Pressburger's grandson, that helps explain why and how the film was tampered with and almost never seen as a result of Prime Minister Winston Churchill trying to ban it. No luck in England. J. Arthur Rank released it in his English theatres and advertised ""See The Banned Film."" And it was a huge hit.

725384,"Firstly, let me start this review by saying this film is certainly not for everyone.  You either get it, or you don't...it's as simple as that.Robin Williams gives a stunning performance in this psychological thriller that is sure to at the very least, get him an Oscar nomination nod.  Williams plays ""Sy the Photo Guy"" at a discount store  Sav-Mart which, for all of us in America is all too familiar.  Sy takes absolute care and pride in his work, to the point of obsession (the altercation with the photo processing technician gives you your first peak at just how seriously Sy takes his work).  Sy becomes obsessed over one family in particular and dreams of becoming part of the family as ""Unlce Sy"".  Seemingly harmless on the surface, you find  that as the film progresses Sy may not be as harmless as one would think.In the opening sequence, Sy narrates a tale of his customers from the new parent with the endless rolls of film, to the amatuer pornographer, which at this point you start to think, ""should I be taking all of my film to the same place to be developed?""Mark Romanek's theatrical debut as a director is stunnng.  The camera work is exceptional, from the enormous glaring halogen staleness of the Sav-Mart, to the drab environment in which Sy lives in at home, to the warm inviting coloration of the family to which he has become, in his own mind, an important figure in.  The set design, costumes and overall look and feel of this film is realistic, and yet has moments where the glaring sterility of everyday life for  a middle aged single male practically smacks you in the face.Some people may find the film a tad slow, but every single frame of this is neccessary in order to fully develop the feeling, mood and the characters themselves.In particular, the ending is something that you absoluetly do not expect, but give yourself a couple of moments to think and it will become very clear as to what the motivation of the characters, screenwriter and director was.I admit this film is not for everyone, but if  you find that you are searching for a film with a bit more depth and are willing to think your way through this, it is well worth the effort and money.",N/A
119471,"This is one of those tales that is really awe inspiring.  As a whole the Batman Beyond series didn't quite catch me like the origional animated series (the one done by FOx) did however with a title like this, and more promising episodes.  I'd say this series has a long life ahead of it.It starts off with Terry taking down a group of jokers trying to steal some high tech computer gadetry.  This is not the usual loot the gang was into so some investigation is pursued.  At a banquet to congradulate Bruce Wayne for winning back his corporation we meet the leader of the Jokers, the Joker himself.  FOr some reason not yet explained the joker knows everything about Batman, including who he is and where he lives.  Bruce wants Terry to stop being Batman shortly after this but we know that won't happen.  I won't proceed any further.This is an excellent title to have in your DVD library.  An excellent story for one thing and a lot of good qualities.  Buy this title at all costs.",N/A

207347,"""That Cold Day In The Park"" opens up in a rather innocuous fashion.  A middle aged woman, Frances, is entertaining some dinner guests when she notices that a young man is sitting outside on a park bench.  It begins to rain and the man attempts to take cover under a newspaper that had been thrown in the trash.  After her guests leave, Frances goes outside and invites the young man inside her apartment to dry off.  It quickly becomes clear that Frances is quite lonely and she tries her best to make her new guest very welcome.  She is in no hurry for him to leave.Unfortunately, the film ends up doing a 180.  At first this appears to be a fascinating look into a woman's lonely existence and her desperate quest for companionship.  Instead, it descends into trashiness and an attempt to shock the viewer.  Perhaps back in 1969 viewers found this to be something interesting in a freakish sort of way.  In this day and age, however, the shock value is gone and its entertainment value lies in its ability to make the viewer laugh at the campiness of it all.  Neither character is at all sympathetic so it ultimately leaves the viewer feeling disconnected.  Sandy Dennis gives a wonderful performance but it is mostly wasted here.  I only recommend this movie for those who enjoy bizarre social behavior.",N/A

38324,"""Magnolia"" is a long, depressing, sad, and tragic movie that is done in a very beautiful and unique way.  Very rarely does a film like this come by.  The film is complex, but it doesn't try to follow a basic plot structure.  Characters talk like real people, instead of just talking about things that center around the plot or point.  I do admit that the first time I saw this movie, I didn't really like it that much.  I knew that I didn't hate it, but it was something that I didn't really care for at the time.I decided to re-evaluate it after seeing P.T. Anderson's masterpiece, ""Punch-Drunk Love.""  I fell in love with it immediately.  You know how all the critics were saying that seeing that movie really makes you want to re-evaluate Adam Sandler?  Well, I decided to do the opposite.  I was already impressed with Sandler long before that movie, so I decided to re-evaluate P.T. Anderson.  So, I decided to give ""Magnolia"" another chance.  And I am really glad, because this time around, I really enjoyed it.The movie focuses around several different characters, who seem to have a connection somehow with one another.  It all takes place in the time frame of one day, and with that day comes revelations, strange situations, confessions, and redemption.  It's like a bunch of different stories, but they're all happening at the same time.  We keep going back from character to character.  Each character is either being troubled, hiding a dark secret, looking for some kind of redemption, running away from the past, or dying.  This film is about coincidence and chance; secrets and confessions; blame and forgiveness; sorrow and pain; and most importantly, redemption and rebirth.There are so many different stars that were in this non-commercial film.  It really reminds you of the power that took place in Tarantino's ""Pulp Fiction.""  The cast includes such stars as Tom Cruise, Philip Seymour Hoffman, William H. Macy, Jason Robards, Julianne Moore, Jeremy Blackman, and many more.  They all do a fantastic job in this very difficult movie.P.T. (Paul Thomas) Anderson is quite the writer/director.  He was able to make a very complex film that doesn't have to revolve around plot.  There isn't just one idea going around in the movie; there's dozens of them!  Each person who watches the movie is bound to take something different from it.  The writing and directing was really amazing.The DVD has a few extras to offer.  Those extras are the ""Frank T.J. Mackey seminar,"" the Mackey infomercial, a teaser and theatrical trailer, TV spots, the ""save me"" music video, and a documentary of the making of ""Magnolia"" that is over 70 minutes long!  The picture quality was very crystal clear and the sound was very high quality.Be warned, this is not a film that everyone is going to like.  If you do not have the time nor patience, then do not attempt this one.  The film is 3 HOURS LONG!  That's right: 3 HOURS LONG!  It's a very depressing and tragic movie, but it is done in such an impressive and unique way.  If you want a movie with a point that is very clear, a very identifiable plot, or a quickly paced story, skip it.  Don't even bother putting this in your DVD player, or VCR player.  This is a film that you will either love it, or you will hate it.  Just be warned.I am glad that I took the time to revisit this film.  I really did enjoy it more the second time around.  I wasn't prepared for a 3 hour long and depressing tragedy when I watched it the first time awhile back.  Now, I was able to let it soak inside my mind and fully appreciate it for what it was.  This is not a commercial-friendly film; this is not a film that is going to be loved by the majority; but to those who do end up enjoying it will be rewarded big time.  Overall, ""Magnolia"" is about second chances.  I am glad that I did just that, and gave it a second chance.  Maybe this is a film that the more you see it, the more you appreciate it.  A very, VERY impressive film from Mr. Anderson, indeed.",N/A

Of course i'm just saying that, but you get that feeling after watching a lot of Anime... at least i do.  And i guess it's a successful anime if you can say that about it right after watching it.Genre: Action, Samurai.  Its second title is Romantic Tales of the Meji.  While leads one to believe these are romantic tales... which they are.  But the first disk isn't all that romantic... the second disk may be.ArtStyle:  I'm a casual Anime viewer and i can say that i have never seen art style similar to this one... though they look like so many art styles i just can't put my finger on a similar one.  Realistic, no funny faces or odd features.  Dark.Gore: Blood, killing, sword fights.The first disc, this one, is about a boy named Kenshin, you see him as a young child.  Now this is not about Kenshin from the Ruroni Kenshin TV series... by no means, he kills in these.  So you see him as this great fighter who no one can beat.  But he finds this woman one night who catches the end of a battle he was in, and gets rained on by some of blood from Kenshin's opponent.The second disk is about what happens after disc one (of course) but it focuses on the Woman a lot too.  The second disc, Betrayal is a must buy, it is a very powerful, if you are a Kenshin fan.These two Dics tell you how Kenshin got the Cross shaped scar on his face.  It'll make you think about it the next time you see another episode of Ruroni Kenshin.I recommend this to any Anime Fan, beware the second disc those that are big action fans.  Oddly enough, as different as the art may be, the voices are the same as the TV series.",Samurai X: Trust

544636,"Just when we all thought we'd seen the back of the good old fashioned creepy ghost story along comes The Others, a good old fashioned creepy ghost story. Starring Nicole Kidman in her second great role and performance of the year (if you haven't already checked out Moulin Rouge you should).The Others was the surprise sleeper hit of Fall 2001. Directed by Spaniard Alejandro Amenabar (who directed Spanish thriller 'Open Your Eyes' recently remade as Vanilla Sky) and produced by the now ex Mr and Mrs Cruise, The Others is a welcome return to the art of suspense, as opposed to the often very poor modern schlock horror bloodfests that seem to appear in our movie theatres on a weekly basis. Set in the English channel island of Jersey shortly after its occupation by German forces during World war II, Grace (Nicole Kidman) is a single mother, apparently widowed, struggling to bring up her children in an old mansion, lacking in basic amenities such as electricity, which was cut off during the war. This is complicated further by the fact that her children suffer from a rare but potentially life-threatening allergy to sunlight and her daughter's claims that the house is haunted. In need of new servants, three mysteriously appear out of the fog BUT did they respond to Grace's advertisement or does their arrival signal a more sinister turn of events?Director, Alejandro Amenabar skilfully takes us on a tour of Grace's impossibly large and foreboding house, permanently in semi-darkness and surrounded by fog. From a slow start and be warned it is a slow start, he slowly but steadily cranks up the tension and suspense, posing more questions than he gives answers, slowly building a grip around your heart and squeezing gently. Nicole Kidman shines as the stern mother losing her mind in what is likely to be an Oscar nominated performance (although in my opinion she is better in Moulin Rouge) and she is ably supported by Eric Sykes as the gardener Mr Tuttle, the two children (Alakina Mann and James Bentley), Christopher Eccleston and in particular, the excellent Fionnula Flannagan as the housekeeper. And although you might just guess the ending before all is revealed, this is still an excellent old fashioned ghost story that (in my opinion) surpasses the likes of 'What lies Beneath' and unless you strongly dislike slow paced films I would highly recommend this.",The Others
239342,"This is my favorite musical of all time. It's wonderfully done, and the story is excellent. Julie Andrews did a great job in her first ever cinematic role, she plays a magical nanny that comes to a rich man's house in order to bring the family back together. What I love about her performance is that she looks very confident and so straight forward and firm, not as playful as you may think. The film also has Dick Van Dyke in the role of Bert, who is a very good friend of Mary Poppins and also handles magic very well. That role was funny and very entertaining(the accent is a bit confusing though), and i loved all of his dance numbers, especially Step In Time, the dance on the roof-top. Another excellent performance was David Tomlinson, who did the role of George Banks, the father of the children. He is very firm and strict, but he can also be very clumsy and forgetful, which is another reason I liked him. His song The Life I Lead was also great. This film was prized with five well-deserved Academy Awards, for the excellent Film Editing, the Visual Effects, like the jump into the pavement picture, the tea party on the ceiling and the smoke ladder, the excellent score, the song Chim Chim Cheree, which may have not been the best song, but one of them had to win, and last but not least, the excellent (oscar-winning) performance by Julie Andrews.

592138,"I expected very little from this one and found myself happily surprised while watching this interesting mix of social commentary and audience-pandering drama (and I mean that in a good way) as an armed father John Q (Denzel Washington) takes over an emergency room when a hospital denies his son's placement on a transplant recipient list and is about to release him.The cards are stacked (think ""Dog Day Afternoon""), the cliches abound (insensitive hospital administrators, numb hot-shot surgeons, blood-thirsty cops, egocentric media types), and there's a enough left-wing propaganda to choke a convention of conservatives (forced rants on gun availability and a cute sound bite from a former First Lady), but somehow I did not feel insulted by it all.Why? The answer is Denzel Washington, a living paradox, someone who barely registers any excitement yet maintains a high level of charisma. Only someone as trusted by an audience and even-keeled could have kept this movie afloat and balanced, and he does.Sure, I felt manipulated, but it worked, and I had a good time. Recommended.",N/A

It's perfect, in my mind, as it is:  a scathing portrait of a strata of society that believes itself to be the most clever, the most acerbic, the most malevolently brilliant, which is not at all the same thing as actually BEING the most clever, the most acerbic, etc.  Know what I mean?",Ridicule VHS

R has a very obvious recall to the R TV series with the main villain, and even SuperS has it's recalling from the TV series with it's connection to &quot;dreams&quot;.I highly suggest picking this up for some of the best Sailor Moon action ever created, fully uncut and uncensored.",Sailor Moon: The Movies - The Dream Set
539966,"This film began with the collaboration of Spielberg and Kubrick and the result is less than the sum of the potentials of the two directors.The film fails to convey the potent acuity and complexity of  Kubrick.  The moral issues and dilemmas of a robots capacity to love and be loved could have been explored more deeply (as the opening scenes seems to suggest), but instead the film becomes an exercise (not surprisingly) in special effects ...(re: Planet of the Apes-esque post apocalyptic New York & ET/Close Encounters/Abyss aliens effects).  Unfortunately the special effects without substance becomes tiring and ultimately boring.On the otherhand Spielberg's panache and strengths in presenting wildly exciting and humorous entertainment seems to almost have been ""held back"" by his concern to pay hommage to Kubrick's more serious vision and ideas.This film bears some similarities to Bicentennial Man released a few years earlier with Robin Williams.

It lovingly narrates the WWII experience of a handful of seemingly ordinary people.  It elaborates on the troubled evolution of the complex relationship between people and things Czech, German and Jewish.  It is endearing and uplfiting. The film subtly confronts and employs some of the stereotyped character types of the war and occupation era.  But does so only to undermine and overturn them eventually, ever so gently.  ""Divided We Fall"" is immensely funny in a traditionally Czech bittersweet manner.  The entire cast is wonderful.  The quirky soundtrack complements the film very well.  Photography makes more than excellent use of dreamy natural light, and the movie is a visual joy as well. A highly recommended cinematic pleasure overall!",Divided We Fall
531810,"Ben Stiller not only directs but stars as the dim-witted male model Derek Zoolander. Derek has been top of the fashion world for years with his trademark `Blue Steel' look. However, there's a new guy on the block called Hansel (Owen Wilson) who starts to steal his thunder. To add to his troubles his friends are all killed in an unfortunate playful gasoline pump incident and he returns to his coal mining family, where he receives a distinctly frosty reception. Chastened he returns to the fashion world where he becomes embroiled in a plot to assassinate the Prime Minister of Malaysia. BUT can dim-witted Derek foil the dastardly bad guys? Will he succeed in building a new school for children who have difficulty reading and writing and other stuff like that? And more importantly can he come up with a new look?Its pretty tough to satirise a business that is already so clearly loony as the fashion world but Ben Stiller's Zoolander is a pretty successful ninety minute wonderfully stupid chucklefest. Ably supported by Owen Wilson, real-life wife Christine Taylor and real-life Dad Jerry Stiller, Zoolander is implausibly good fun, which is perfectly suited to the DVD format. It's full of excellent set-pieces and comic timing, such as the Walk-Off, Listen To Billy Zane and ""What is this a centre for ants?"".  What's more it boasts some excellent cameos from the likes of Jon Voight (as Derek's coal miner Dad), David Bowie and Billy Zane. All in all this pretty much lives up to being `The Spinal Tap' of the fashion world.

495770,"Is how the bartender responds to Harold Diddlebock (Harold Lloyd) when told that he's about to have the first drink of his life.Harold gets talked into it by 'Wormy' a deliciously street-wise octagenerian urchin that asks him for a loan of a couple of bucks. Harold complies, despite the fact that he's just been fired from his job.The inspired bartender concurs with Wormy that Harold needs a drink to ease his troubles and---in a scene only Preston Sturges could have written---creates a ""Diddlebock"" in his honor.Originally entitled 'The Sin of Harold Diddlebock', the real sin is in being unable to rent it in most video stores.  This has got to be one of the top comedies ever made.Lloyd came out of retirement to make this film after meeting and befriending kindred maniac, Preston Sturges.In ""Mad Wednesday""  Lloyd performs some of the funniest sight gags ever captured on celluloid, employing his trademark high-risk stunts. (Ever see 'Safety Last'?) Houdini would have been proud.In all his movies Lloyd played a hopelessly naive gung-ho optimist who triumphed against the world despite his childlike sweetness.But here the formula takes a twist, thanks to Sturges.Lloyd is now a middle aged failure who has been stuck in a menial job for the last twenty years, a weary, disillusioned man who is pathetically in love with his co-worker, an impossibly beautiful ingenue (There's always an impossibly beautiful ingenue in a Sturges film ). And then he gets fired. . .Neddless to say, all will end well, and he will triumph and get the girl in the end.But not before going  berserk on ""The Diddlebock"" which transforms him from a meek innocent into a lunatic gambler and high roller with a taste for um... somewhat loud attire.Poor Harold wakes up sober two days later to find himself the owner of a circus, replete with strongmen and bearded ladies who are owed back pay and hungry lions that need to be fed.It's all silly fluff of course but the genius of Preston Sturges's writing makes us cheerfully suspend our disbelief and go along for the ride.Only Lubitsch and Billy Wilder came close to Sturges in the ability to give the audience superbly witty dialogue while maintaining a believable world of madcap lunacy where events move at breakneck speed.An great farce, starring a comic legend, written and and directed by the best.Enjoy.",Mad Wednesday VHS
453646,"Brilliant movie. I'm not sure why this movie came and went without much noise being made. Was it the fact that it was just another Jim Carrey movie... let alone Jim Carrey in a fairly dramatic role? My children almost seemed disappointed in Carrey. Disappointed in the fact that he wasn't acting like his normal characters - like Ace Ventura, Stanley Ipkiss or Lloyd Christmas. Wonderful performance by Jim Carrey and his supporting cast... Ed Harris, Laura Linney and Noah Emmerich (as Marlon). A film about false reality... all the characters in Truman's life are paid actors. Halfway thru, the story really picks up when Truman starts to figure things out. It's interesting to see the home audience watching and their reactions... from the viewers in the bar, the senior citizens watching at home with their Truman pillows, the car attendents, and even the guy that is forever in his bathtub. Truman Burbank's life is a TV show, and the whole world is watching. His dilemma begins when he gets the urge to explore - as he is telling his best friend Marlon about the need to ""get out there and see the world""... first stop is the island of Fiji. Naturally, the producer of the TV show (Ed Harris as 'Cristof'), wants to keep him at bay and will do anything to stop him... for without Truman, he has no show. Truman has been forever afraid of the ocean - since his father 'died' in a storm at sea right before his eyes. Now Truman must sneak away from the cameras and face the ocean to leave his so-called  reality. Cristof finds him in his boat and throws a wicked storm his way. Outlasting the storm Truman finds that the horizon isn't really what it seems. Great movie with a great ending.

705757,"I went into my first viewing of We Were Soldiers with high expectations(I have seen it twice now, and plan to see it again) Being a Mel Gibson fan, as well as a war movie aficionado, I could hardly wait to see this screen interpretation of retired Lt. General(Colonel at the time of the battle)Harold Moore's novel entitled We Were Soldiers Once...and Young, a true account of the first battle of the Vietnam War which involved American soldiers in combat. The movie covers the events leading up to the battle, including the massacre of a French regiment in 1954, 11 years before the battle takes place, which plays a role in Col. Moore's battle strategy against a much larger Vietnamese army. The story develops several important characters. Gibson delivers another rock-solid performance as Col. Moore, a highly intelligent and seasoned commander whose life is guided by a firm dedication to his family and his country. A quick note: Mel Gibson is seriously considering retiring from acting to focus on producing, which will allow him to spend more time with his wife and seven kids. His next movie, Signs(from the wrier/director of The Sixth Sense, which is done filming, may be his last as a lead actor, so relish this one if enoying watching his performances. Madeline Stowe is excellent as his wife, Julie. Some of the most emotional moments in the movie occur when Mrs. Moore takes on the difficult task of informing some of the other wives of their husbands' deaths in battle. Sam Elliott(Tombstone) turns in an excellent performance as Col Moore's 2nd in command, Sgt. Major Plumley. Chris Klein and Keri Russell do a fine job as Lt. Jack Geoghegan and his wife Barbara, who have a child shortly before the fighting begins. Greg Kinnear once again delivers as Major Bruce Crandall, a helicopter pilot who provides invaluable assistance by transporting supplies and troops, as well as provoding cover fire under extreme pressure. And last but not least is Barry Pepper, who follows up his amazing portrayal of Roger Maris in 61* with another wonderful performance as Joe Galloway, a photograper who risks his life in an attempt to help himself(and his country) understand the nature of  a war that divided this country more than any before it had ever done. We Were Soldiers does an excellent job of portraying the American side, but it really distinguishes itself by giving a face(as well as respect) to the Vietnamese soldiers who fought and died along with many American soldiers. Many movies about the this war villianize the Vietnamese people, but this movie takes an important step by showing us a glimpse of the actual people on the other side. While we obviously  give unyielding support to our own soldiers, it is also important to remember that the soldiers on the other side were real people who belived strongly enough in their cause to give their lives for it. We Were Soldiers does an excellent job of creating extremely intense and realistic battle scenes. This movie is not for the squeamish, but if you're like me, you want the battle scenes to be as realistic as possible in order to give the most accurate portrayal of what really happened to the men out there. We Were Soldiers is a story about a group of men showing extreme courage and dedication to one another under the most dire circumstances. While one might say that this is a fairly common theme in war movies, let us not forget that this is a TRUE story. The men who died on the battlefield weren't just fictional characters, they were real people with families who died serving their country. These men became a family themselves, and went to extraordinary legnths to help one another. Their dedication and sacrifice  truly somthing to be respected and admired by everyone. We Were Soldiers is an excellent film, and I highly recommend it to anyone who wants to know more about the Vietnam War and the men who fought in it.",N/A

407468,"I consider the Pod People a fairly average MST3K episode--that of course means it is very funny, but I can't put this one anywhere near the top of my favorites list.  Certainly, there are some great aspects to this one, such as the repeated Huzzah! and McCloud lines (which never get old) and Servo's memorable Yoda impersonations.  The Pod People is hopelessly pointless, somewhat depressing, and downright unwatchable; Joel and the Bots had a dickens of a job in making this episode hilarious, but somehow they did it.  The movie is so bad that it is not even listed in my comprehensive video movie guide.  Half of the movie's budget (which I estimate to have been about $100 altogether) was spent on fog machines.  Apparently, the producers thought that hiding all the action and characters in a deep fog would help keep viewers from realizing how atrocious the movie is--they were quite wrong.For starters, the opening credits feature clips from some other movie--the Creature From the Black Lagoon-looking monster here has nothing to do with our movie, which features the ridiculous-looking Trumpy, a hairy bipedal pig-type alien.  The first characters we see are poachers (who look like Lorne Greene and Dan Fogelberg) who apparently make their living by stealing birds' eggs.  They are too dense to notice a gigantic explosion in the woods caused by a falling object.  The producers lull you into the belief that no scene or characters can be worse than this one, but don't let them fool you.  As if by magic, we are transported to a cheap music recording studio and forced to listen to the worst group of singers on earth.  Meanwhile, back in the woods, a little red-haired kid finds a giant egg in the woods, brings it home, and hatches it--enter Trumpy.  Unfortunately, another pod person is roaming the land killing everyone it meets.  When the lousy young singers go camping in these woods, there are put on a collision course with the funny-looking alien.  There's more fun later as the annoying kid tries to protect his new friend.  I could go on, but there is really no reason to--this movie's plot is almost nonexistent.  Maybe a judge forced a producer to make the worst movie he could possibly make as punishment for some heinous crime--that's the only way I can explain this movie's origin.I mentioned the terrible, supposedly hip music the band sings.  Amazingly, it is actually much better than the funky New Age sounds the viewer is bombarded with throughout all the other sections of the movie.  The skits feature SOL versions of the goofy band song as well as some repetitive Yanni-like New Age sounds as performed by ""Some Guys in Space.""  They are really in a singing mood because they close with the haunting ""Clown in the Sky.""  Joel rather than Tom Servo does most of the singing, which is probably one reason I don't particularly care for the song skits.  Personally, I would not recommend this video as a newbie's introduction to MST3K; it's good, but it's far from the best.  By all means, buy it, though.I would be remiss if I did not point out that The Pod People does have one talented actor.  The kid's kitten truly shines among a cast of absolute nobodies, responding to cues perfectly, foregoing the use of a stunt kitten in the scenes in which he is tossed from one piece of furniture to another, and executing the ""hiding under the bed"" scene to perfection.  Sadly, his aspiring career as a cat among cats was cut short prematurely due to the utter inanity of this movie in which he, much to his regret, signed on board to do.",Mystery Science Theater 3000 - Pod People VHS
27436,"Those of us brought up on Rex Harrison will find Leslie Howard's Professor Higgins rather hard to swallow. He is far meaner, far ruder, far more arrogant and far less the &quot;loveable rogue&quot; than Harrison was. But he is no more or less true to Shaw's original creation, and he turns in a worthy performance alongside Wendy Hiller as Eliza Dolittle (another sterling performance, even if her cockney accent is less convincing than Hepburn's later attempt).It is difficult nowadays to appreciate just what an achievement this collaborative effort was, but for its time its cinematic liveliness is outstanding. The montage sequences are enhanced by Arthur Honegger's stirring score. Harry Stradling does a fine job of the photography, and was, I believe, later to photograph George Cukor's film version of &quot;My Fair Lady&quot;.

Her kids are both scary and sad, and the three servants who come to work, and eventually prove the key to solving the whole mystery, (not really a spoiler) are funny at times and disturbing at others.This is one of the best Victorian-style stories, read-around-the campfire movies I've seen in years.  It doesn't go in for the usual ""gore factor"" that a lot of movies dealing with the supernatural seem to think we all need.

604913,"It has been four years since the last Star Trek movie so fans (myself included) have been eagerly awaiting the release of Nemesis.  I'm happy to say the film does not disappoint.  As most fans know, the basic plot involves the Romulan's overture of peace to the Federation.  The Enterprise is dispatched to Romulus at the request of the requisite bad guy Shinzon, played nicely by Tom Hardy.  Suffice it to say Shinzon is not actually Romulan, but has engineered an usurping of the Romulan government as a means to an end for his grand plans.  The premise for his actions is sometimes hard to believe, but Hardy is convincing in the role.  My only complaint about the film is that sometimes the story felt a bit hurried.  At a running time just north of two hours, I guess there was no choice.  The action level of the film has been kicked up a couple of notches.  At times it plays like a Star Wars movie.  While it works for this movie, I would hate to see the future films go down the action road at the expense of plot development.  The epic space battles are nothing short of excellent.  Some fans have criticized the film as being too much like Wrath of Kahn.  Indeed the similarities are there, but is that such a bad thing?  I submit that in this case it is not.  The entire TNG cast is present along with a few cameo appearances, but the spotlight falls on Patrick Stuart and Brent Spiner.  You don't have to be a ""trekkie"" to like Nemesis, but it helps with the nuances of the film.  Still, there is enough action and story development to please even casual Trek fans.  Highly recommended for Star Trek and science fiction fans alike.  Worth the full price of admission.",Star Trek: Nemesis
344083,"Here is the legendary film that spawned hundreds of imitators, starring the one and only Marlene Dietrich in her early Hollywood signature role of Shanghai Lily. Actually, anybody else in this role would have been silly. Only a mysterious creature like Dietrich could carry this off.More of an ensemble picture than one would think, the film has a pretty straight-forward plot, which is unusual for a Von Sternberg film. Dietrich plays a coaster, which is a polite term for a hooker, in China. she and group of other strangers board the Shanghai Express enroute to Shanghai. On board, she encounters former love Captain Harvey, who is about as warm as ice water. During the trip, the train is hijacked by Chinese rebels, and Lily must choose to sacrifice herself for her former(and still) love to save his life.As I said, it all sounds hackneyed, but when watching, one can't help but be mesmerized. Dietrich is at her most exotic and alluring in this role, and you really can't take your eyes off of her. She carries the entire film in her hands, and the ending is the only one you can accept.

It's simply a hidden gem.Quite everything and everyone seems to be disfunctional in this movie: Nixon's presidential reign, the family, the parents-children relationships, the coming of age. Not a single character seems to be happy, enjoy himself or having a good time; even in the few funny scenes one doesn't have the feeling that the characters involved in it are getting some pleasure. Their actions aren't simply motivated by the need for sex or their abundant libido; there's a glaring shared desperation for communication between them which seems to be paralyzed by their own dullness and unhappines. There's a cold relationship between almost all of them: the children have no real connection with their parents, the adults on their side having so much problems with each other, agenda oblige.Every child character seems in desperate need for love, communication and comprehension: ""I love you"", says one of them. ""That's sweet...are you drunk?"" answers the other. Every adult character seems unsatisfied with his/her empty life, always in search of what is missing, although they don't seem to know what is missing in their existences. After having consumed an adulterous physical intercourse, one of the characters begins to talk about a serious subject (one of the few times in the movie). ""You're boring me...I already have a husband!"" answers the other.This is the tale of some common human beings desperately wanting to love and be loved, and yet permanently in anger, trying to drown their desperation and emotional drought in shoplifting, extra-conjugal relationships or blowing model planes up in flight.

241346,"In this, the 74th Star Trek episode, we find the Enterprise travelling to the cloud city of Stratos on the planet Ardana to get a rare mineral to help stop a plague on another planet.Classic Trek has told stories about two different civiliztions clashing before, and this one holds very little surprises.  The upper crust of society lives in a city held above the planet's surface by powerful anti-gravity generators, while the lower class toil in the mines below to gather the mineral wealth of the planet that they are not allowed to enjoy.The stereotypical plot lines of the story almost detract from the rather heavy handed message that the episode is trying to get across - that all people are people, and should be treated with the same respect.  The seperation of the ruling class from the working class is emphasized too much by things like the city floating gently far above the troubles they create.The reason that the Troglytes (short for Troglodites?) have a retarded intellect and violent tendencies is their constant exposure to a gas that the mineral produces, and not anything actually genetic.  McCoy finds out that they are the same race.  Plasus, the leader of Stratos, resists giving the Troglytes gas masks to help filter their air until Kirk forces him into a situation that exposes him to it directly, in clear violation of the Prime Directive.One of the only saving graces of this episode is Spock's obvious interest in Droxine, the daughter of Plasus.  Spock get her to finally agree that the Troglytes might be her intellectual equals despite their contant exposure to the mineral gas.I would have liked to see a story about what happens to this civilization after the major society changes that Kirk and crew just about forces on them, but that is impossible now except in the non-canon Star Trek books.My score - 5.5 out of a possible 10 (1/2 point for Spock's interest in Droxine).","Star Trek - The Original Series, Episode 74: The Cloud Minders VHS"

204289,"The unsatisfying film adaptation of James'  WASHINGTON SQUARE starring Jennifer Jason-Leigh only shows how wise William Wyler was to film the Goetz's stage version rather than retain James's original storyline. James's little novel about an Old New York heiress, Catherine Sloper caught in a tug-of-war between her heartless father and her fortune-hunting suitor (Morris Townsend) ends with a very Jamesian ending: Catherine learns to grow beyond her father's and Morris's petty battle, and in so doing shows her superiority to both of them. In adapting this novel for the stage, the Goetzes decided that such an ending (admittedly sublime on the printed page) would be hard to do onstage, and instead retain the Balzacian melodramatic air James drew upon by allowing Catherine her vengeance on father and Morris alike. The result is spellbinding. William Wyler crafted out of this melodrama one of the most hard-to-forget films of the Hollywood era, a masterful little exercise in emotional cruelty that has been championed by (among others) Martin Scorsese, who regularly lists it as one of the five films that most influenced his own work.The sets are superb, and there's a lovely film score by Aaron Copland. But what really makes the film is the acting. There are only four major performers--Olivia De Havilland as Catherine, Sir Ralph Richardson as her father, Montgomery Clift as Morris, and Miriam Hopkins as Aunt Penniman--and all four give their best performances ever here; they seem to spur one another on to better work than you'd imagine them capable of doing. De Havilland is the one who most stands out: at first, though suitably old, she seems too beautiful to be effective as Catherine. But her fine portrayal of Catherine's crippling shyness makes her unattractiveness to both Morris and Dr. Sloper exceptionally believable. When Catherine undergoes her awful education, De Havilland very bravely allows herself to change a great deal so that while she's still Catherine you're aware of how radically she's changed. The highlight of the entire film is Catherine's showdown with her father, when she more than outmaneuvers him and utterly devastates him: De Havilland here does some of the acting the screen has ever seen. The scene begins with De Havilland's simple words, ""Morris deserted me,"" which she delivers with about a hundred different levels of feeling at once, from shame at herself for being fooled, to almost bemused exasperation at Morris's shallowness, to fury at her father. It ends with her dramatic (and surprisingly frightening) declaration to her broken father, ""That's it , Father--you'll never know, will you?"", which leaves you aware not only of how thoroughly Catherine has beaten her father but at what a cost to her own soul. I can't imagine even one of the great stage actors doing more with this scene than De Havilland does. It's the performance of a lifetime.",N/A

This movie is an excellent portrait of good people making bad mistakes.Right after seeing this film, I was originally tempted to think of it as a combination of Bridges of Madison County and Fatal Attraction, but that would be an injustice, since Unfaithful is superior to both. Unlike Fatal Attraction there's no psychopath to focus upon as the root of the problem and unlike Bridges female infidelity is stripped of its romantic superiority to male infidelity.What we are left with is an incredibly honest and insightful portrait of good people making mistakes.Even when a murder is committed, the audience is never allowed to write off any character as bad guy.Every character is carefully developed and even after I left the theater I felt that powerful sense of concern over what happens next to these people.

718061,"If I had a choice between the comedy of ""Dragonheart"" and the drama of ""Reign of Fire,"" I would definately, without a moment's hesitation, choose the latter.First of all, let's get one thing straight. This is not the fantasy dragon film you and I have been waiting for. As stated by a character in the film, there is nothing magical about these prehistoric beasts. They are as mortal as the dinosaurs in ""Jurassic Park,"" though infinately more dangerous (obviously).The key to enjoying ""Reign of Fire"" is having the right expectations. This is not a pure, wall-to-wall action flick, which is what the ads imply. This is not even a fantasy flick. This is an apocalyptic sci-fi drama (key word: drama) about humanity, it's will to survive, the dangers, the risks, the rewards, the choices, the hindrances, etc, etc, etc. It bears the cliches of several genres, and while it never soars above its peers, it plays out like a breath of fresh air. Just don't breathe too deeply.While ""Reign of Fire"" contains the occasional monster-movie-esque run/chase/trap/escape/fight action sequence, the dragons are not that terrifying. They certainly scare the film's characters aplenty, but the fear never translates beyond the screen to the audience. The fact of the matter is, the dragons are secondary to the two main characters of the film, portrayed aptly enough by Bale and McConaughey. Bale is dark and broody and McConaughey is truly psychotic. He chews up the scenes with the best of them (re: Gary Oldman) and he's loving it. His character is a total nutjob who, excluding the ""party-crashing"" scene, brings much-needed lightness to an otherwise overly depressing film. And geez, the guy is huge.I was expecting to have a lot of fun with this one, but such was not the case. Lacking any jump-out-of-your-seat shocks or spine-tingling chills, the script is too bleak and dreary. The effect the dragons have on Bale and his band of refugees is readily palpable but oftentimes too burdening.Character development is slight but sufficient, with Bale's ""Quinn"" being the most fleshed out. Scorupco's high-flying ""Alex"" and Bale's adopted son ""Jared"" had potential to be great characters but were severely underused. Disappointing but not surprising.I wanted to fall in love with this movie, but alas, there are huge, distracting gaps of common sense in the script that don't hold up to scrutiny. Why do the dragons, supposedly super-smart, fight the humans singly when they outnumber them by the hundreds? How did the first dragon baby come to being with only a daddy to start with? And where in the heck did the humans get all that fuel and electricity?! But really, it's not worth dwelling on such flaws. Overlook them and ""Reign of Fire"" may just surprise you with its unflinching eye to despair and it genuine grasp of raw emotion. Plus the dragons look pretty darn cool. That is, when you actually get to see them.It's a sad thing when the best scene of the whole movie involves Bale, his friend, and a bunch of kids, but no dragons whatsoever. It's a smart scene that resonates on several layers of meaning by paying homage to the concept of an oral myth passed down through the generations. Unfortunately, the rest of the script never reaches the same intelligence and it becomes obvious the screenwriters struck gold by mistake. They were just telling an old Stars Wars joke.Another noteworthy scene is the elaborate skydiving dragon trap. It's stupid, impractical, inefficient, and ineffective, but it's an ultra-cool concept that results in some awesome visuals and the best thrills of the entire film.All in all, ""Reign of Fire"" is an unusual summer flick that's smarter and darker than your average blockbuster. It certainly could've used a bit more action, a better climax, smarter battles, a lot of charm, and a huge dose of prozac, but the film delivers enough oompf to meet expectations.One minor warning: Bale has a pretty thick accent and I couldn't follow alot of his dialogue. This probably didn't make much of a difference to my understanding of the film, but I found it very annoying nonetheless.",N/A
286910,"Originally released for Christmas in 1935, this splendidly produced, atmospheric and magnificently acted film displayed M-G-M's flair for filming literary classics - DAVID COPPERFIELD was released earlier that year - with no expense spared; the storming of the Bastille sequence employed several thousand extras and was filmed on one of Hollywood's largest sets ever. Ronald Colman was intially reluctant to play the role of Sidney Carlton, that charming but dissolute lawyer who commits the ultimate self - sacrifice ...... It took great persuasion to make Colman shave off his trademark moustache for the role of Carlton, but he delivered more than likely his finest performance ( Later in his life, Colman admitted this was his personal favourite of all his roles ).

137686,"This film is more than just funny. It's wicked, sharp, satirical, and in the end, surprisingly sentimental. First of all Monroe, as others have mentioned, is marvelous in a role as a put-upon woman who's nowhere near as dumb as she seems to think. (Anyone who actually *says* they're dumb is often not at all.) Both Lemmon and Curtis play their roles of girls-who-are-really-guys to the hilt, and even George Raft makes the most out of his mob boss role which is also a spoof of his film persona (""where'd you pick up that cheap trick?!!""). Little bits of dialogue- such as ""You tore off one of my chests!!"" and ""I hope my mother never finds out!!"" are what really make the film sparkle. Stellar moments include a rollicking, moonlit, 'first date' sequence with all three principals (following the band's performance), and a touching telephone scene of Curtis and Monroe ending their affair; this scene never fails to bring tears to my eyes and merely re-iterates what a fine performer Ms. Monroe was (despite her infamous history with the production). I think it's writer/director Billy Wilder's finest moment. The film is gorgeous in B&W, and the fadeout line is, in fact, ""perfect!!""",N/A
103219,"MIDNIGHT IN THE GARDEN OF GOOD AND EVIL is a great film. It has a few flaws. However, a great cast, beautiful location, and an intriguing story make up for the flaws. The film shows the grandeur of the south, and the seedy world beneath the beauty. If you enjoy mysteries, beautiful scenary, and fine acting, you should buy MIDNIGHT IN THE GARDEN OF GOOD AND EVIL today!The film features a wonderful cast. Kevin Spacey superbly plays the character of Williams. He brings to the character an eccentric undertone hidden by a convincing Southern charm. John Cusack is excellent as John Kelso. The character seems to retain his northern culture while still being talented enough to be well recieved by the people of Savannah. This shows enormous talent on Cusack's part. The accents are surprisingly convincing for the most part (even for Englishman Jude Law). The cast makes the film  better and more intriguing.Savannah is a gorgeously southern city. The trees provide shade and add to the atmosphere. This wonderful city provides excellent locations and a breathtaking backdrop to the film. As the events of the film are true, the location is all the more important. By shooting in Savannah, the film is enriched and integrity is restored to the tale.In the seventies, a horrid crime took place in Savannah. An aristrocrat named Williams stood accused of murder. The story and trial captivated Savannah and the nation. Thus, a splendid novel was written. From the novel came a briliantly done film. The film is a bit too long, but everything else about it is wonderful. MIDNIGHT is a film that shall be talked about for years.MIDNIGHT is a great film. It has a wonderful cast including Kevin Spacey, Jude Law, and Anne Haney. The locations show beauty and ugliness as well as good and evil. The story itself is intriguing and makes for a superbly interesting film. If you enjoy a grand film, you should buy MIDNIGHT IN THE GARDEN OF GOOD AND EVIL.",N/A
451621,"Chip Davis concerts are without saying, an experience in the realm of music and sound that will stay with you for days upon a time.  As leader of the legendary Mannheim Steamroller, his knack for selecting the proper music for each performance is astounding.  I've seen his concerts many times, but this last one in December of 2002 was seen through the eyes of my grandchildren Nick and Alexis.  They sat there spellbound, feeling each emotion in the transition of the musicians and orchestra that sent your head reeling with joy and excitement.  Nick, who is 12 years of age, took the CD that he purchased at the concert to school with him the very next day and gave a talk about the concert.  His class was very impressed with the CD and his presentation of the evening's music. The reason I mention this event is the album I'm about to review has most of the cues inclusive ~ &quot;MANNHEIM STEAMROLLER CHRISTMAS LIVE&quot;.Mannheim Steamroller has a unique sound, probably some of the most talented musicians around today.  As usual the Dolby Digital 5.1 Surround takes you into another dimension, with picture perfect clarity that makes you feel like you're right there in the audience.  Mannheim Steamroller are enthusiastic in their performance in a live fashion ~ leading the way is Chip Davis (drums/perccusion/recorders/toys), Jackson Berkey (piano/harpsichord/keyboards), Arnie Roth (concertmaster/violin), Almeda Berkey (harpsichord/keyboards), Ron Cooley (guitar/fretted instruments), Roxanne Layton (recorders/percussion) and Chuck Penington (conductor)  This 56 minute &quot;Christmas Live&quot; concert takes us from the real world on a journey of delight featuring many favorite cues from the past Christmas albums.Some of the stand outs are ~ &quot;ANGELS WE HAVE HEARD ON HIGH&quot;, a big favorite around my house ~  &quot;RUDOLPH THE RED NOSED REINDEER&quot;, fulfilled arrangement, still as popular as ever ~ &quot;JOY TO THE WORLD&quot;, blends melody with counter melody and a driving power that leaves you wanting more ~ &quot;PAT A PAN&quot;, the video part of the program shows two youngsters a boy and girl growing up, later marrying as he goes off to war and not coming back, their little boy opens presents one Christmas morning finding a toy drum just like his father played, very touching with a tear entwined through the musical presentation.  Another favorite as always is the Renaissance part of the program  like &quot;IN DULCI JUBILO&quot; and &quot;WASSAIL, WASSAIL&quot;, each musician using a Renaissance instrument as the audience watches the Big Screen as the players recreate the time and place, Mannheim musicians performance as usual is pure perfectionIf you want to get into the &quot;Christmas&quot; spirit and the spirit of loving ~ this DVD is a keeper.

667693,"Isabelle Huppert is in one great movie after another. A couple of years ago she played the mysterious and apparently selfless wife of a famus composer in Claude Chabrol's Merci Pour Le Chocolat. This time she plays a piano teacher in yet another role filled with subtlety and mystery. The role is in many ways reminiscent of the earlier one as Huppert reveals clues to her characters troubled psyche with odd and disturbing actions which offer a sharp contrast to her calm and collected exterior. She does much of her acting with the same expression which makes her one of the most interesting performers to watch for what she conceals with each performance is what fascinates and keeps us attentive. The performance Huppert gives as the piano teacher is a disturbing one for beneath her reserved exterior and her very high reputation seethe the passions of an unhappy woman. Whether her mother has caused her daughter to grow into the person she has become or not is perhaps a matter for debate. It appears the mother is over protective but then as the story progresses one sees the mother has good reason to be over protective. Huppert's piano teacher loves her mother it seems but also wants to torture her mother. For her students the piano teacher wastes no time with feelings it seems but again the performance is subtle and layered and offers clues that perhaps she does care for them in her way. It is possible to interpret some of her actions in more than one way. Ultimately we find it is only she herself she wants to humiliate/torture as we see her act out in various circumstances-- most notably in her actions toward a young student who has an infatuation with her-- her own self-degradation. Frame to frame the story is exquisitely shot and told. The music is used to incredible effect. In one particularly fabulous scene the director allows the high plane of music of a previous scene to follow Huppert into the next scene where she enters another plane,one that is not high.",La Pianiste
719157,"Nicole Holfcener's ""Lovely and Amazing"" is not all lovely and amazing but it certainly is pretty and unique.  I think the film's success or failure depends largely on how you perceive/like/tolerate/love/hate Catherine Keener; for she is the kingpin and the do or die of this movie.On the negative side, Catherine Keener-wise, she has pretty much been playing the same role for the last ten years: super smart, a bit needy, marginally successful, and sometimes strident.  And she exhibits many of these traits in the role of eldest daughter Michelle Marks, daughter of Jane (Brenda Blethyn) and older sister of Elizabeth (Emily Mortimer).On the positive side, Keener has some rare for her quiet, dramatic scenes that she handles with aplomb. These scenes mostly involve her mother and her stepsister and they are refreshing in that Keener is allowed to show her softer, vulnerable side. She also has some hilarious, loopy, smartly written and directed scenes with Jake Gyllenhaal as her erstwhile and amorous ""boyfriend.""""Lovely and Amazing"" follows the lives and loves, the ups and the downs of the Marks women in their various quests for boyfriends, flatter tummies, fulfilling jobs, etc.Holcener has infused the film with humor and a slightly off-center wit that carry the film along at a fast clip but she also knows how and when to slow down the pace and get serious.  There are many touching scenes such as the one between Elizabeth and Kevin McCabe (Dermot Mulroney) in which she asks him to assess her naked body because, like most of us, she has body issues. He reacts by pointing out the mostly good as well as the not so bad.  He calls the incident ""refreshing"" and indeed it is in an astringent, gee-she's-really naked-for-three-minutes kind of way.  Heretofore, McCabe, an actor and closet good guy has been painted as a jerk but Elizabeth obviously sees something we don't and proves to be right.""Lovely and Amazing"" is a rare breed of film: one that can make you laugh and then laugh harder. It touches not only your heart but your soul as well.",Lovely & Amazing
534581,"This movie reminds me of ""Forrest Gump"" because of the sentimental themes, the subtle, creative symbols, and the proactive, determined struggle of the main character, which happens to be played by Tom Hanks in both movies.The theme of this movie is about what is really important.  Chuck Noland (pun for ""no land"") works for Federal Express and oversees time management.  He thinks time is wasting and he doesn't know how right he is.  He's constantly working and flying all over the world.  He exchanges Christmas gifts with his girlfriend at the airport in the car then hands her a wrapped gift which is obviously an engagement ring.  He tells her to hold on to it until New Years Eve, and promises he'll be with her then.  She gave him a family heirloom pocket watch with her picture in it.  He says he'll always keep it set to Dallas time and then rushes to his plane, which tragically crashes into the ocean.He is the sole survivor but luckily he managed to float on a liferaft overnight and by morning stumbled upon a small uninhabited island.  This is where he begins being what is called proactive-- he deals best he can with what life dealt him.  He is resourceful and exercises initiative.  The bulk of the movie, his stay on the island, is very unique because he is the only human being shown, there is no music, yet it never ceases to be fascinating.  He could just wither away and die or even commit suicide, which he almost does, but he decides to live.  But for what?  Namely for his girlfriend, whom he thinks about constantly and keeps the pocketwatch open to her picture.  Symbolically, while the plane was losing control, he dropped the watch and risked his life to get it before it fell out of the broken plane.  The plane crash symbolizes the harm of overcommitment to work and being too busy and focused on schedules and time.  The watch symbolizes his life back at civilization.  The plane crash made the watch stop ticking.  I also think he decides to live just for the sake of life itself even with all its discomforts.  A great turning point and memorable scene of the movie is when he bravely decides to voyage off the island on a raft he constructed.  He could easily die in the middle of the ocean but the reward is to possibly get back to civilization.The reason it is a turning point in the movie is because when he gets back, it actually seems as if he were better off on the island.  As he's floating away from the island, he looks back at it and you can feel that he will miss it because of all his hard work, all he went through, and all he achieved.  Notice the title of the movie is ""Cast Away"" not ""Castaway"".  This is because the real point is that being cast away by his lover was worse than being a castaway for four years.  On the island, he yearned for companionship so bad he actually developed a relationship with a volleyball.  Of course everyone thought he was long dead, including his girlfriend.  So she married someone else and had kids.  His friends throw a party for him, but he seems the least happy one there, thinking of whether or not he'll get his girlfriend back.  Her husband greets him awkwardly as we would expect him to and explains that his wife is confused and doesn't want to see him right away.  However, he should have at least prepared a little better as to what to say to him and been friendlier.  Symbolically, he is a dentist and once performed a root canal on Chuck.  At this point, I really felt contempt for her new husband and I was rooting for Chuck.  I felt he deserved her after all he went through and how he never stopped loving her even after being away for four years.She seems ambivalent and confused at first, having meetings with Chuck and showing him the news articles and scrapbook she has of him and how she kept the Jeep that they were in together last at the airport.  As he drives away in it, she chases him and kisses him and tells him he's the love of her life.  Yet, her decision soon becomes clear as she goes back to her new husband, expensive house, and children.  I felt so sad for Chuck.Of all the packages that washed ashore, he kept the last one unopened.  He finally delivered it in person when he got back.  Saving this package for that purpose shows his determination and hope for the future.  Why else would he have saved it?  Just like in Forrest Gump, this is a subtle, curious action.  He leaves a note saying the package saved his life.  No one is home and we never learn what was in the package or their response.  The package was of no tangible use to him like the contents of the other packages but it was the hope that he would be able to deliver it that saved his life.  As he's leaving, he stands at a crossroads.  He's out west where miles of flat ground stretch all around him.  A pretty, vivacious woman drives up and tells him the names of each of the roads and where they lead.  I wondered why he just let her drive away when she seems interested in him and he's single trying to get over a lost love.  The movie ends there, with Chuck standing at the crossroads not knowing where to go next, symbolizing how his life has been turned upside down twice and the big question on his mind is, ""Now what?""  The messages of the movie are that close relationships are more important than working and that we've got to do the best we can with the cards life deals us.",N/A
441073,"Ah, to be young, low of budget, and inventive.Such was the predicament Sam Raimi et al found themselves in back in 1982.  A head brimming with ideas for odd-angled shots, staccato editing (two Raimi devices used to great effect in one of my favourite films, ""The Quick and The Dead""), and better methods for splattering gore was all that Raimi took into the Tennessee woods with him (oh, and the indispensable Bruce Campbell tagged along too).  What he came out with was a film that manages to be simultaneously sophisticated, primitive, gruesome, and hilarious: ""The Evil Dead"".While not as blatant about its task as its more polished sequel ('polished' being a relative term), Raimi's first trip down splatterfest lane intends to mock horror movie conventions with all the glee of an omnipotent slasher.  So when someone goes to check the dark cellar, or a mysterious sight up ahead in the woods (""You stay here... I'll be RIGHT BACK!""), they're gone for a longer time than usual.  The audience, used to the length of such scenes, will actually get antsy that Our Hero has perished.  When a hand quickly grabs the wrist of a helpless young woman, it's not always the demon of our nightmares, but the young lady's beau.  During the climactic showdown between the deadites and Ash, Ash is repeatedly thrown against a wall, only to get trapped underneath a flimsy fallen bookshelf.  It comically couldn't have a more inextricable grip on him than if it was a giant octopus.  And for such a small, deserted cabin, it sure has a lot of doors and rooms through which evil can hide.  The Labyrinth was less daedal.The one drawback here, besides the wooden acting, is the complete lack of story, character development or social message (okay, so that's three drawbacks).  To sum up, five young friends go for a vacation weekend in a deserted cabin deep in the Tennessee woods, where they accidentally wake up the spirits of the dead (story).  Ash dates Shelly, Scotty dates Linda, and Cheryl is Ash's sister (character development).  And as for social messages, well, it could be construed as having a shrewd environmental commentary: after years of mankind raping the forests, here we have a forest raping a young woman (a deliciously shocking scene).  But that's probably giving the filmmakers too much credit.Regardless, there's surely enough blood and dismemberment, of both the sincere and sidesplitting variety, to satisfy your appetite for carnage.  And enough laughs, of both the intentional and unintentional variety, to keep you laughing between screams.",Evil Dead VHS

225959,"Nearly 25 years and people still talk about it.  Ridley Scott's all time space odyssey classic, the original Alien.  We all know the storyline by now, so I'll get right to the point: all these years later the film still holds up, and it can still terrify the daylights out of anyone.  Scott used the claustrophobic set pieces to create an eerie doom-like atmosphere along with an overwhelming sense of dread (much like Tope Hooper used in Texas Chainsaw Massacre).  Considering when this movie was made, the Alien is fantasticly designed, and the special effects were great as well.  What made the Alien seem so terrifying is that it looks so real, not like in the movies of today which are bloated with over the top CGI effects, the Alien looks real because it is real, and that is what real horror is all about.  Sigourney Weaver's career was catapaulted after Alien was released, and the well rounded cast, including Tom Skerrit, Ian Holm, the late Yapphet Kotto, and John Hurt as the unlucky birth ground for the Alien all give terrific performances.  The DVD extras are worth noting as well, the deleted scenes offer new insight to the film, and Ridley Scott's commentary is great as well.  All in all, this is a landmark film of science fiction that no one should ever miss.",Alien VHS

First, given that they allegedly spent nearly $5 million on this, I was hoping for at least an hour. Instead you get a half hour, plus another half hour of outtakes and background.  And while the actual episode has its moments, it isn't all that funny. In fact if you aren't already familiar with the cast of characters, you won't ""get"" quite a bit of it.  As others have noted, there's a bit of Dr. Who mixed in here, along with an opening scene that parallels/parodies the opening moments of the 1960 version of  ""The Time Machine"" ... and even a visual sequence straight out of The Wizard of Oz.  All well and good, but it's not enough to carry the story.  As the plot unfolds, we see BA and Baldrick muck up history, and then try to correct their errors, but this is hardly a new idea  -- ""Back to the Future,"" anyone? -- and not handled very imaginatively here. The best part is the ending, but even that isn't up to the standards set by the better episodes of the series.  This is worth watching once, if you're a BA fan, but not worth buying, IMHO.

673614,"I've watched this DVD a few times now and every time I watch it I catch myself marvelling at how excellent Ben Folds is on the piano. It's like a natural extension of his body. And I also marvel at the things he's also doing when playing the piano - keeping a beat with his body whilst standing up and playing, then playing a harmonium simultaneously! For me, a budding pianist, just to watch Ben Folds perform is worth the price of admission.But. There's so much more than that on this DVD. Perfect sound quality, picture quality and camerawork for one thing. They play all of their classics too. Folds lets the piano have it in `The Last Polka' and `Philosophy', and uses a microphone on the actual piano strings whilst bassist Robert Sledge attacks his bass guitar to elicit feedback in `Song For the Dumped'. Amongst other things, you get the trademark wild behaviour we've come to expect from Ben Folds Five: Folds stands on his stool, bashes the keys with his shoe throws his stool at the piano; the band launch into seemingly spontaneous tangents; and they fool around in `Underground'. Put simply, this DVD is about as close as you could come to actually seeing them live if you never got the chance. I didn't, and now I'm satisfied!You also get 45 minutes of extra `spare-reels' footage on this DVD after the concert. This is where the DVD kind of falls down. The picture quality isn't very good, the sound is adequate, and the camera technique is quite poor. You seldom get to see Folds actually hitting the keys (that's where I get the chills up my spine). Also, about 6 out of the 9 songs played in this section were played in the West 54th bit, but it's great to hear a live version of Jackson Cannery, as well as some studio shots of BF5 recording `Don't Change Your Plans' and `Army'. Interspersed between the songs on the spare-reels section is little nonsense clips of the band fooling around. In one clip they are riding small German motorcycles whilst Sledge claims ""I wanna be free to ride my machine without getting hassled by the man!"" In another they encounter a psychopathic stuntman who beats them all up, breaks Ben Folds' finger and snaps Sledge's arm. Very funny stuff.Ultimately though this DVD is really well worth the purchase price just for the concert at West 54th. It's so perfectly executed and well done, and the band play so well and with such gusto that it's like you're part of the audience. In fact you get a much better view than the audience! The spare reels section adds some laughs another dose of the band going nuts again, which is great, but it pales in comparison with the first section of the DVD. Nevertheless, I'd give it four stars easily, probably four and a half.",Ben Folds Five - The Complete Sessions at West 54th

679886,"I may be in the minority here, but I find the US version of ""Queer as Folk"" offensive in its portrayals of gay men as drug addicted dancing queens.  Unlike its British counterpart, which at least balanced such characters out with other less stereotypical elements... the US version seems to focus almost solely on the sexual prowess of its characters, many of whom are ill defined and selfish.  Sure, they've tried to balance some of this out with the lesbian couple, but by and large, the first season is simply a way of introducing these illogical characters, none of whom seem very appealing on any level. I give it three stars because the acting is uniformly fine, and the music is terrific, but on the whole, ""Queer as Folk's"" US cousins fall flat week in and week out.  To be sure, there are gay men who spend their entire lives chasing sex, drugs and Donna Summer, but in this day and age, wouldn't it be nice to finally see some normal gay men and women who live full, ordinary lives like the rest of the world does?

374018,"CLERKS is a film that a bunch of buddies and I watched repeatedly in college.  Even after having seen the film more times that I can count, there's still something there that can make me laugh.  If you haven't seen it, then you certainly should, as long as you aren't one to be easily offended.  However, a word of warning to the uninitiated: the movie originally received an NC-17 rating based purely on the raunchy dialog.The characters in CLERKS are some of the most memorable and entertaining people that you'll ever see in a movie.  Becoming more familiar with the film after multiple viewings, it may surprise you when you realize exactly how small the roles are of some of the unforgettable inhabitants of Clerksworld.  Olaf the Berserker, Snowball, the various angry, irritable customers, and others don't really have all that much screen-time, but I'll wager that many people will be quoting their favorite lines and insults to their friends for weeks after seeing the film.Of course, the main selling points of the film are the two lead characters, the eponymous Dante and Randall.  Relatively speaking, they both have the same job.  Dante works in a convenience store, Randall in a video store.  Because he lets his boss walk all over him, Dante always gets stuck with the worst shifts, and dealing with the worst customers.  He can't make up his mind over his love life or his future.  He has no idea what he wants to make of himself.  On the other hand, Randall delights in showing up late for work, temporarily closing the store any time he wants to hang out in the convenience store (which is practically the entire movie), and ""ripping into the occasional customer"".  He is in exactly the place he wants to be, as the low ambitions he sets for himself have been achieved.  The two characters play off of each other perfectly.  One is angry, but content to mutter and complain about the terrible hand of fate, while the other is satisfied by hanging out with his friend on company time and wasting as much of the work day as possible.The commentary track on the DVD (originally recorded during a break in the filming of MALLRATS and meant for the Laserdisc edition of the film) offers quite a bit of insight in the script, the background, and the filming.  Unfortunately, the recording took place using only a single microphone that was passed around to the various people sitting in the room.  So while the DVD box claims that a lot of the cast and crew were involved, it is actually made up primarily of Kevin Smith with only cameos from the rest of the participants. Still, Smith does offer quite a bit of behind the scenes trivia, and after starting in a faintly overly-defensive mood, really loosens up and gives one the impression of someone who is still quite proud of his work, but isn't blind to all faults.The most notable person on the commentary track without the initials K.S. is Jason Mewes, who spends the entirety in a drunken stupor, only waking up briefly to swear, to claim that he loves chicks, and to incorrectly quote his own lines from MALLRATS.  The primitive method of recording the commentary means that when other people in the room remark on parts of the movie, we can hear Smith responding to them, but we can't hear the original comment that inspired the reply.  It's a fairly frustrating listening experience, but ultimately one that is still rewarding.The other DVD extras are well worth viewing as well.  There's a whole bunch of scenes that were cut from the final version of the film and there is also an alternative ending that, thankfully, Kevin Smith had the good sense to remove before releasing the film to theatres.  The Soul Asylum music video is entertaining enough, and lets you watch a short version of the CLERKS hockey game sequence in color and with the band members playing along.Buy this DVD.  It's a whole lot of fun.  It's got comedy, romance, action, idiots, stoners, and geeks talking about science fiction.  It's also got Jay and Silent Bob, who are worth the price of admission just by themselves.",Clerks VHS
532997,"I was really looking forward to this movie when I saw the previews, mainly because it starred two of my favorite actors; Mel Gibson and Helen Hunt.  I must say I was slightly disappointed...  but only slightly.  It is a very funny movie.  Mel plays Nick, a shallow womanizer who suddenly has the ability to hear what females are thinking (all females, including dogs).  Nick, while a basically decent sort of guy, is not altogether likeable, especially if you have strong values about feminism.  Mel's portrayal is excellent, especially during scenes of outrageousness (like the scenes where he tries the feminine products).  But, his character is too superficial to feel for.  Helen Hunt's character Darcy, on the other hand, is real and down to earth, and very likeable.  There is one poignant moment when Nick uses his &quot;gift&quot; to help a girl who might commit suicide.  If there were more moments like this in the film, it would have been much more substantial and enjoyable movie.  There was one whole area of the film that made no sense to me -- there's a girl in a coffee shop with whom Nick had always flirted... she had always made it clear that she was interested... but, only after Nick gets his new ability does he ask her out.  But, he's too preoccupied with Darcy to take their relationship seriously.  I was left thinking, &quot;What was the point of that?&quot;  Overall, it's a very funny, but superficial romantic comedy (with a somewhat predictable ending).",N/A

What else could you ask for.  i think that the show stepped into its own half way through season two and then moved at full pace in season three.  It is up there with the first season of Roswell or any of the Babylon 5 seasons(Well maybe not quite that good) but anyway it is truley something remarkable.  It is unique clever and entertaining.

It seemed everytime you think you know what will happen next, something very different happens. Though some of the FX were true to made for tv movies, it was really done well. Then there was the ever popular cameo of Stephen King with his comedic expressions that made me take a break from the chilling moments to laugh for a brief second only to know that something IS going to happen soon to return me to the edge of the couch.

30565,"In Deconstructing Harry, Allen protrays his alter-ego of Harry as an abomination, an ultra depressed, woman cheating, tap-dancing (with words), and obviously oblivious to other people's feelings persona.  And yet, it is Allen's second best film in my opinion.  I like characters like this in the movies, who are unsympathetic and yet in-advertantly by being the protagonist you have to feel a little sympathy after a while (how can't you when he reveals Billy Crystal as a Hollywood hating Satan, a common Jewish man turns out to be a murdering cannibal, and that there are signs that goddesses exist at Victoria's Secret?).Here, Harry has writer's block for the first time in his life (his last name is Block as well, pun possibly intended) since everyone he has taken from his real life and ""thinly disguised"" isn't around to give him any ideas (outside of the Crystal thing).  The bulk of the film holds flashbacks, in brilliantly edited fashion, where he recollects his old stories, the alter egos of his real life wives and relatives and so on.If Woody had made this movie as a deep and serious self-reflection of his demons, it would be interesting but it wouldn't be funny.  Here, he reminds his old fans that he can bring laugh out loud jokes and gags, most for Jewish people, to be sure, but all around ones as well, and the moment you realize it's a comedy/drama and not a vulgar piece of cinema that was thrown from Woody's chair as a backlash to the critics, you'll have fun.

693178,"I am amazed at how many 5 star reviews are presented to this movie by the people who are ""blown away"" by how good it is. I read one which said people who gave the movie a bad review must have been reading spoilers. I am facinated by the fact that the general public cannot seem to see how exceptionally BAD this movie is!Let me start by saying that I LOVE star wars. Han Solo is my favorite character followed closely by Chewbaca. I've got every version of the movies on VHS (including special edition). I have books about star wars technical jargon and the like pilled in my room. But no matter how much I love the series, I cannot help but be astounded at how horrible these past 2 films have been.Do people out there actually FEEL emotion towards these two-dimensional characters? Do we feel pitty for Anakin as he masacars a tribe? Are we on the edge of our seats, gripping the chairs because of the animated chases? Is the mystery of the clones so horrible and secret since the title gives it away? Are we suppose to empethise with Amadala as she falls head over heels for the brat Anakin? Do we honestly think george lucas can direct a movie?The sad truth is that the only thing George Lucas has going for him anymore is his name. We hear ""george lucas"" and we MUST see his movie and unconditionally believe it's great because HE is GEORGE LUCAS! George should be REMOVING his special FX and relying more on traditional fx so that the whole Trillogy will work in one viewing. How on earth can the CG battles in the past 2 (and likely 3) transition to the models on wires, blue screen matts and old optic effects of the 4th-6th?Don't waste your money on this one.

688767,"but ALL IN THE FAMILY on DVD won't be or will it? I almost always wait until I own a DVD before I review it so I can give a detailed account of everything that is on it, so I decided to come back and update my review since I just received this DVD set today. Obviously the show is 5+ stars in quality but my 3 star review is for presentation on DVD. I had already heard that this DVD set was going to be a ""bare bones"" set with no extra features. In my opinion, that was a bit of an understatement. First, there are NO extra features - NO commentary, behind the scenes, interviews, photo galleries, and not even bios of the cast. Second, there is no ""play all"" episodes feature or ""scene selection"". So you have to select the episode you want to watch each time and you can't skip to the beginning scene instead of watching the opening ""those were the days"" song. The sound is english mono which didn't really surprise me but I did have to turn up the TV a little more than normal. The subtitle options are english and spanish. The packaging is a ""tri-fold"" case (like Fawlty Towers) which I kind of like because its compact. The discs are clear on the surface which will pick up fingerprints very easily. Concerning the content itself, this set features the first season - consisting of 13 episodes on three discs. Discs 1 & 2 have 4 episodes each and Disc 3 has 5 episodes. The set could have easily consisted of two discs, especially with the absence of any extra features. The episodes in this set (as titled from the included booklet)are:01. Meet the Bunkers02. Writing the President03. Oh, My Aching Back04. Judging Books by Covers05. Archie Gives Blood06. Gloria's Pregnancy07. Mike's Hippie Friends Come to Visit08. Lionel Moves into the Neighborhood09. Edith has Jury Duty10. Archie is Worried About his Job11. Gloria Discovers Women's Lib12. Success Story13. The First and Last SupperI hate to say it, but in terms of presentation of this DVD set, those involved sort of ""dropped the ball"". I think that the sound and transfer could have been better.  Also only 4-5 25 minute episodes on each disc without anything else on the discs? I feel that it was rushed out on 3 discs for profit reasons and it wasnt given the care and presentation it so deserved. 3 disc sets are fine (see other popular shows on 3 discs) if they have a good amount of extras.  I really hope that Season 2 is released with much more care and features! At the top of this package it says ""The Emmy Award-Winning, Ground-Breaking Series"" - Well any series worthy of that label deserves much much more in way of features and design. ALL IN THE FAMILY deserves this not only because of it's importance in television history and the memory of Carroll O' Connor, but for the many fans who will cherish owning the series in digital form. Don't get me wrong this DVD set is still much better than the VHS compilations wether you buy them or tape them off television, but thats to be expected right? Its DVD! This DVD set can easily be recommended because well its DVD. That and because this is the only way you can get the ""unedited"", commercial free, complete first season of ALL IN THE FAMILY. So if you can rejoice in that alone (and you really don't have a choice if you want this show) then I say order yours today. I had to have one or else I would've felt like a ""weird wolf""!",N/A
592913,"There is a sad fact about movies: If it makes money, it'll likely get a cashin sequel. Even remakes like Doctor Dolittle manage it - anything to bring in a few extra bucks. But when 5 years exist between original and sequel, surely it's not a case of acute cashin sequilitis?Alas, yes. This movie took similar time to materialise to Star Wars Episode I... yet somehow, it still managed to add so very little to the excellent film that was Men In Black. Now there was a class act of a blockbuster. Decent effects, yes, but it boasted Tommy Lee Jones' fantastic restrained-yet-hilarious performance, delivering excellent lines with perfect speed; it had a decent script; and obviously it offered a new slant on the alien conspiracy theory idea. It was great, even ending with a lovely unnecessary but really effective existencial visual.MIB2 falls flat on its face because, instead of saying ""Hey, what more could happen with the Men in Black,"" they simply re-do the original film, albeit with less impact and a far-too-great sense of self mockery. The list of problems is as follows: The story is a virtual rewrite. ""The Galaxy"" is substituted for ""The Light"" (quite what said Light is, we are not told); The Bug is substituted for Serleena; The new/old agent theme is still present, albeit the roles are reversed; the story takes similar turns, though slower, with a similar (admittadly effective) ending visual of a similarly perspective-setting nature.Next, Tommy Lee Jones. Before he was restrained and sardonic, for me the highlight of Men in Black... here, he simply looks bored for the duration of his scenes. Clearly just roped in for the cash, and to rescue an already bleak so-called ""plot,"" he seems incapable of that lightning-fast delivery we were so gifted with last time. Will Smith dumbs down his character to seem ever inferior to Jones, which doesn't help his already ""love him or hate him"" fan status.Then, there's the humour. Yes, there's one or two decent lines - the majority of them from Smith after neuralising someone - but there's simply too much of it. Everyone's playing for laughs, even Rip Torn's Z (in a cringe-inducingly awful karate scene), and there are pointless cameos from the likes of Michael Jackson (a wasted oppertunity) and Tony Shalhoub's Jeeves (who simply rehashes the head-shooting joke from the first movie). It tries so hard to amuse, it ends up a simple mockery of the whole concept. The other agents are feeble, one bursting into tears for no reason, the others cowering at the sight of Tommy Lee Jones' character. Humour is a good thing, but constant?Lastly, there's the fact that it could actually have been really good. The film's only decent ideas (Jeffrey the Subway Worm; A super-fast multi-limbed postal worker; The Statue of Liberty neuraliser, etc) are ignored, forgotten or plain wasted. This is in line with various plot mistakes (the guy with two heads disappeared between scenes, not to be seen again) and just acts to annoy us that this film was so nearly a riot.Why did it take 5 years to produce something we'd expect them to take 2 years to do? It's a tired cashin. Even Danny Elfman's music doesn't inspire, and armed with some hefty visuals (one or two actually coming off well, particularly the hilarious ""race who live in a locker"" scenes) it has the look of what it is: The ""bigger, louder sequel"" that accompanies ANY film these days.It's a let down. Worse than that, it's so short that the action slugs along and takes a final mad dash in the closing reel. Do yourself a favour and stay happy with the far superior original.",N/A

266260,"(Rewind eight years.) A seven-year-old little girl, her four-year-old sister and her parents are sitting in their family room watching a movie. The parents are smiling, amused, as their daughters watch the screen in awe. Because the scene playing on the television involves, a princess named Leia, a pilot named Han and a jedi named Luke, who are desperately trying to save a galaxy from an evil empire headed by the seven-year-old's vision of the ultimate villain, Darth Vader.(Fast-forward eight years.) I was that seven year old. And to be really honest, at seven I wasn't so crazy about this movie. Oh sure, I liked it, it was hard not to. But words can't express how scary it was to me.But now, at fifteen I'm here to give the most positive review possible to this extraordinary film.This movie is amazing. I consider myself a pretty good writer, but I'm warning you right now through this whole thing all I'll do is blubber. This movie can't be described in words. It's just so good. It's my favorite Star Wars movie. I could watch it all day. I love it. I'll sing it's praises 'till the day that I die. I love it. It's just amazing. Did I mention I love it?In my opinion this movie contains one of the best scenes ever filmed. Who can forget...whether they were terrified, mesmerized, horrified or stupefied...those shattering words: ""Luke, I am your father."" That was a monumental point in film history.Now, I'm all for the new Star Wars movies, they aren't quite the same but they do provide interesting history to the original trilogy. But the real reason those movies get bad reviews and such is this: In episodes IV through VI the characters are just amazing. Darth, Leia, Luke, Han, Yoda, etc. are just so sensationally three-dimensional. Leia is aggressive and courageous. Han is cocky, headstrong and infuriating yet impossible to dislike. Luke is valiant, fearless and loyal. Yoda is inspirational and stirring. And as I said earlier, Darth Vader is the epitome of evil.This heroic movie is a heartening example of hope, audacity and humor in the bleakest of grave situations.

525016,"Sometimes a movie is able to rise above it's trite and oft told storyline. The one used for U-571, which is about submarine warfare in W.W.II, can be summed up as follows: sub meets sub, sub loses sub, sub gets sub. Fortunately, in the hands of director Jonathan Mostow and his crew, U-571 has been crafted into a tight little thriller which should have most viewers on the edge of their seats. I should add that it is not recommended for anyone who is more than mildly claustrophobic.The story is a blend of several true events, although in real life, most of the heroes were British, not American. German submarines were equipped with a radio device called Enigma, which was able to transmit coded information that only the Germans could translate. Without the device itself, the Allied Forces had a very hard time of tracking the U-boats. These were devastatingly effective in sinking our ships.A fancy wedding reception for an American Naval officer is interrupted by military police bearing the news that leave has been cut short for the men of one sub. Navy brass has learned that a German U-boat has been disabled in the Atlantic and is awaiting a repair sub. The plan is simple. The Americans will use a sub outfitted to look like a Nazi one. They will attempt to reach the German sub before the Nazi rescue vessel does. They will then board the enemy vessel and seize the Enigma. After taking the Germans prisoner, they will sink their U-boat. The Germans will then have no way of knowing that the device has been captured. Like most simple plans, this one quickly gets very complicated. It also gets extremely dangerous.Jonathan Mostow uses some effective tricks to make U-571 rise above its script. From the opening shots, which show how the German ship was crippled in battle, he manages to keep the movie's tension level very high. The American sub is an old one. It creaks constantly. There is water always dripping from its old pipe joints. These effects work well, because they convince us landlubbers that this thing would be unsafe to be in during peacetime, much less during a war. So, we have already been set up before the first enemy torpedo races towards our heroes, trapped as they are in this unnatural craft. Later, there are the depth charges. The crew can't see them, but they can hear them. They get louder and louder as a Nazi destroyer gets closer and closer. It all turns into a suspenseful game of cat and mouse, and the tension level is raised even higher as everything about the mission goes dreadfully wrong halfway through the movie. .While this film is filled with great actors, there is not much to be said for this cast, simply because the characters are subordinate to the special effects. This is appropriate for this kind of movie, where too much character development tends to get in the way of the action. If you think about it, a thriller, by its very nature, doesn't work if there are lulls in the story. In U-571, there are hardly any.",U-571

They also show a fat guy trying to get in the ring but gets nailed by Hall and Nash and Security. Pretty funny.Then they show some footage of nWo attacking guys like Sting,Bagwell,Mysterio,Luger etc...then Hog Wild 96 where Hogan wins the WCW title from the Giant and spray paints it black with nWo letters.Then some great footage of Nitro but then..it forwards all the way to Feb.2002!!!! What the ??? where did the rest of the nWo go and the split into red and black and white and black?!?! and the reconciliation of the two?Then they show their return at NWO 2001 and the Rock - Hogan thing the next night on RAW.Then footage of beating up a guy with a austing shirt and a coffe checker and Spike Dudley.Then theres Rock vs. Hall. and then a Hall-Austin video package for Wrestlemania X8, then clips of the match then next is the Rock - Hogan video package feud and clips of the match. Then the next night on RAW is shown (which was in Montreal that i attended) anyways where hogan comes good and i guess the rock forgets what Hogan did to him by the belts to the back,the beatingsmthe hammer to the head,the semi ramming into his ambulance etc... Anyways then it goes to Smackdown with Nash vs. Rock where X-Pac comes back.Then done.Overall: I was really happy that a video had WCW and WWF/WWE footage but for nWo which should have been like 70 min wcw and 34 min wwe but instead it was about 40 min wcw and the rest WWE.

A glowing red and yellow circus tent, in the middle of the woods, from there on the klowns take over, trapping the entire town in cocoons of cotton candy, there are many humorous parts in this film, such as when the klowns go inside the drug shop and start making an entire mess of the place, most funny was when the klown came to the counter where the nervous clerk was and put down an enormous amount of items on the counter. Not much on scares but alot in laughs, and the film never slows down, it always keeps it's pace. I really love those klowns, especially the one that comes out of the pizza box!

593118,"Here we have Mothman Lite, right down to the insect in the title.  ""The Mothman Prophecies"" is a chilling supernatural thriller where a man obsessed with the drawings of his dead wife finds his way to a town where people are getting messages from the unknown.  ""Dragonfly"" is a syrupy tale about a despondent man obsessed with the drawings of children claiming to be in contact with his dead wife that lead him to the unknown.  A coincidence?  I doubt it.The films are different as night and day.  Mothman is a true supernatural thriller, replete with suspense, fright and eerie messages from the other side.  Dragonfly attempts to be a transcendent romance with love so strong that death cannot contain it.  There is nothing remotely spooky about it.  Most of the film concentrates on Joe's (Kevin Costner) inability to cope with the death of his wife.The film drags, with Joe traversing the same emotional ground again and again.  We keep having scenes repeated over and over between Joe and the children who contacted his wife, and Joe puling to Mrs. Belmont (Kathy Bates) who keeps trying to talk some sense into him.  The final scenes in Venezuela border on goofy, but to the writers' credit at least the ending wasn't totally predictable.Kevin Costner gives us his standard depressed nice-guy rendition only a bit whinier than usual.  Kathy Bates is feisty as always as his stalwart friend.  Linda Hunt is intense in her role as the nun who believes in near death experiences.This film is far too sappy to be a thriller and misses the romantic interaction of films like ""Ghost"" and ""Always"" in its attempt to be transcendent.  It fails to distinguish itself in any meaningful way and slides aimlessly into mediocrity.  I rated it 5/10.  If you want a thriller, see Mothman.",N/A

Both are haunted by the loss of their beloved ones and draws on emotional solace through intense sexual communication. The tragedy unfolds in the town of Southern Georgia where racial discrimination is rampant - and the flawed characters reflect silently the dysfunctional society through their mannerism and attitude. Leticia castigates her obese son to shed his weight to prove ""blacks are not a disgrace""; Hank is tortured in a rigid families where obligations conflicts with a strained father-and-son relationship. They meet under a twist of fate - and their romance is at once tenuous and fragile with the hidden truths...MONSTER'S BALL would not have been such a triumph if not for the strength of the versatile Billy Bob Thornton who injects subdued grief and sensitivity to the character, where Hank matures under the harsh lessons and eradicates his racism to translate his yearning for love and passion. Halle Berry in what may be her most explosive and visceral performance yet as the dignified Leticia, elevates the emotional core of the love-story. Their heated sex is a vent for their frustration and injustice done to them. Supporting cast including Heath Ledger as Hank's suppressed son and Peter Boyle as Hank's imperious father proves equally arresting.Yet as a movie Monster's Ball under Marc Forster's direction fails to break through of the love-story mold to enhance with symbolism and unravel the truths. It is a pity that the darkness of the surburban renders atmosphere and scenes like where their hands are intertwined behind a cage/fan to suggest deeper interpretation, yet it never succeeds to give the audience a clear meaning to that symbolism. There is lack of elaboration and thus totally left to the grounds of imagination even to the point of its inconclusive epilogue.As such, Monster's Ball is bolstered on the calibre of the seasoned ensemble to waltz the graceful tango of love and raw desperation. It is essentially a love-story when it could have been so much more as an insight on racism and character study.",Monster's Ball

As the egotistical, rather decadent film director, Lowell Sherman is fine. This was George Cukor's first big success as well as the first talking picture which took a jaundiced look at Hollywood.  As a footnote, this story, which was written by the once-popular Hollywood columnist Adela Rogers St. John was the basis for the three later versions of A STAR IS BORN. It was supposedly based upon the real life of silent star Colleen Moore and her alcoholic producer husband, John McCormick.",What Price Hollywood VHS
463767,"I was not expecting to like this movie.  In fact, I felt as if my chances of spontaneously combusting while winning a hand of blackjack on an online casino were better.  A friend of mine, however, suggested it.  One must bear in mind that I am normally not that vulnerable to the power of suggestion, but this was a very hot girl and hot girls generally don't talk to me.  So I call the video store:  ""Hi, do you have 'She's All That?'"" I asked.  ""Uh, yes,"" they replied while dialing 911 on the other line.  Let me tell you, you have not died a slow death until you go to a video store and say ""Hi, I'm the guy who called about 'She's All That.'""Now granted, the make-over tale is a fairly trite and cliched storyline.  For some reason, however, ""She's All That"" isn't as bad as some would think.  Why you ask?  Rachel Leigh Cook is really, really hot.  So hot that even the director's clever attempt to make her ugly (a pair of glasses) didn't work.  Now, I wear glasses.  What are they trying to say here?  But either way, the travails of one Lanie Boggs are actually somewhat riveting and I enjoyed watching this movie.The one thing I'll say this movie was missing however was a large animated dog.",N/A

Frank Baum's Wizard of Oz is one of my many favorite movies and the favorite of millions world wide.Almost directly from the pages of the book to the screen, the Wizard of Oz delivers great sing a long, family fun, great for all ages. With vibrant, brilliant sets and (for it's time) amazing, detailed costumes, it has eye candy and of course the lovely songs such as &quot;Somewhere Over the Rainbow&quot; and &quot;Follow the Yellow Brick Road&quot;.This is a great movie and I highly recommend this movie to anyone, no matter how old or young because I think that all will enjoy this film.

19076,"The screenplay of Columbia's 1955 PICNIC preserves the hothouse atmosphere of William Inge's original stage play while opening it up, letting us see the city park that hosts a Labor Day celebration. The acting and plot mix intense and absorbing use of realism, symbolism, and just plain over-the-top acting, as various characters deal with their own demons at crucial points in their life.""Picnic"" was nominated for many Oscars, and two were awarded: one to James Wong Howe's cinematography (oh, those blazing, symbolic sunsets for those who will not go gently into that good night!); the other for the music, which mixes the theme tune with that old standard ""Moonglow.""Time: 1955. Place: small Midwestern grain-processing city similar to Hutchinson, Kansas. Opening: studly vagrant (William Holden, end of his young-man roles) drops into town via freight train. Poor side of tracks: Lower middle-class mother; nubile, nineteenish, dime-store employee and town beauty Madge (Kim Novak), who is envied by brainy but plain younger sister (Susan Strasberg). Our beauty, however, is not too happily betrothed by unwritten rule to town grain scion's son.Holden's role in the plot is the classic ""new kid in town"" theme. Arrogant by nature, and with an eye for Madge (which is not rebuffed, or so we think), he violates every socially acceptable notion of age, social class, and small-town propriety. Sparks fly; usually nasty ones, except for the ones between Holden and Novak, in which case you can guess . . .Superb acting, better than we have a right to expect. Stage director Josh Logan (""South Pacific"" ""Mister Roberts"") wisely played to each character's strength: nubile Novak's vulnerability, little sister Susan Strasberg's emotive ability (her father was Lee Strasberg, who invented Method Acting); Holden's blustery kick-...bravado, and Robertson's slow understanding that his privilege doesn't necessarily extend to things erotic. The movie also boasts an excellent supporting cast including the overlooked and underappreciated Arthur O'Connell as the old-maid schoolteacher's reluctant swain.  Look for all-around buddy and fellow schoolteacher played by chunky, loveable Reta Shaw, whose name may be known by few but whose presence is felt in many a movie.And that menopausal schoolmarm Rosalind Russell: Roz is just amazing in a performance that mixes everyday behavior, venom, confusion, sweet pardon and existential bewilderment as she rages, rages against change of life and her unmarried status--and that without resorting to any of the standard ""PMS"" stereotypes.  As excellent as her earlier career-girl roles (""His Girl Friday"") were, ""Picnic"" showed the industry that la Russell had what it took for complex adult drama.If you can take 1950s melodrama for what it is, ""Picnic"" is one of the best. Some really intense acting takes place from an ensemble that would never be assembled again--effective juggling of complex, symbolic subplots--and a genuine if overstated portrayal of Fifties themes. To plagiarize Roz Russell from her later flick ""Mame"": ""Picnic"" is a banquet: Don't starve yourself.",N/A

There were some parts that made you think, but overall, it was slow and only vaguely interesting.This film leaves a little to be desired if you are looking for something a little believable. Bruce Willis is nowhere near as animated as he normally is. Very subdued. Samuel Jackson does his role well, but not up to par with what you's expect.This film appears to be a low budget way to get some money based on the leading characters names alone. I'm glad I did not see this in the theatre. Don't take me wrong on this, the film is not terrible, it's just not good. It's watchable, but nothing that you go to work the next day and tell all your friends about it and compare notes. It's just another movie.The real surprise to me was that the DVD was a two disc set. Special features... There was no action, no special effects, not even a complex story line. What special features were there? I was so disappointed in the film, that I didn't even put the second disc in. I thought about, but...  There were no scenes that I was interested in seeing again.Anyway, it's worth watching, but not keeping. Save your money and buy a good action film.",Unbreakable

""First Blood"" took place in America, dealing with the difficult and disturbing question of reinsertion of Nam veterans in the American society. This question's been erased for this sequel, located in the Viet-nam jungle. The movie has the same basis than the one in ""Escape from New York"" - a prisoner sent in hell for a rescue mission, with pardon and freedom offered in exchange -; here, the hell is Viet-nam, the police is replaced by the army and the gangs of New York, by bloody Russians and Vietnamese soldiers. James ""Titanic"" Cameron, who wrote the script with Stallone, started in movie business working on the Carpenter film; he took its basis element and used it for ""Rambo 2"". In ""First Blood"", the enemy was American, and Rambo killed only one person, and not on purpose, it was self-defense; in this movie the enemy's Russian and Vietnamese, so Rambo can do everything he wants, and this is the starting for a long and heavy butchery, especially when they kill his girlfriend. But the whole is watchable anyway.The final message is very beautiful but also utopic. Who cares how brave the G.I. were in Viet-nam, no matter the guts they gave; they lost the war.

I immediately decided it was my favorite film of all time, and, 40 years later, it still is. Horton Foote's brilliant screenplay accomplished a feat that is almost unparallelled: it reduced a complex, character-driven series of events into a 2 hour coherent classic narrative. Its profound effect on me has been a bit of a character builder for me; I'm a better person, I think, for having seen this film at a young age. I encourage all people with children in their life to show this to them. Kids often pay more attention to a film that's seen thru the eyes of kids.

679933,"Toshiki Hirano's pattern in this series is to create a situation that a shinma can take advantage of, bring Miyu into the story to oppose the shinma, and then allow the damage done by the shinma to progress to its logical conclusion.  This is disquieting, since the humans involved are often destroyed by the underlying tragic conflict.  Thus, the series is dark, and moody, the only peace is sometimes brought by the vampire's kiss.Take 'Red Shoes,' for example.  In a deft retelling of the old legend of a pair of magical dancing shoes, we find Chisato and Miho in a talent competition.  To everyone's surprise, Miho wins and, with the help of a pair of magical red shoes, she is on her way to becoming an idol singer.  However, behind the shoes are a shinma who uses them to drain away Miho's life.  Miyu tries to stop the shinma but, as is always the case with this legend, there is a terrible price.In 'Your House,' a young couple rescues a cat from a couple who died in a suicide/murder.  The woman becomes insanely dependent on the animal and history is on the way to repeating itself when Miyu tries to intervene.On a less grim note, Chisato, Miyu, and their friends visit Ikegafuchi, a well-known hot springs.  Chisato stumbles into a swamp and discovers a young boy who has sworn to wait for the return of a guardian.  Miyu finds that what was guarded was an ancient shinma and must battle to prevent a repetition of its release on the world.Then a gangster, killed when an assassination fails, gets an opportunity to live again, complete with a new face.  In 'Supple Face,' he has an opportunity to make thinks right again, but soon he finds himself waking with no memory, blood on his hands.  Even when Miyu breaks the curse of the shinma, destiny refuses to budge.In several of these stories, Miyu drops into the background, only becoming directly involved when it is time for the shinma to meet its fate.  This is reminiscent of the OAV series, where sometimes she is more of a force of nature than a real character.  While she cares more for humanity that Reiha the snow demon does, the vampire still feels no great allegiance - the tragic events of the episodes are beyond her responsibility.  .  The victories of the spirit world are often more chilling than reassuring.",Vampire Princess Miyu: Illusion - Volume 3

On watching the Dvd ive got used to this translation so could relax into it a little more.The biggest annoyance by far is merry and pippin, they have become bumbling prat fallguys, and even the music whenever they start providing sideshow relief is cringing, this is not such a good traslation to say the least.Unlike some i found Legolas one of the better played parts, along with Sean Bean, who i was hoping when i read the original casting was going to be Aragorn, he would have been so much better, mind you Hugo Weaving as Legolas would have been a big improvement, but i welcome his prescence as Elrond, even if hes underused.The computer effects work overall but some time a litlle unsubtle.

This was first shown in New York in 1992 in front of critics who gave it a standing ovation. Before the film, the director gives a brief video commentary describing it. I'm amazed by the restoration job done on the normal film; colors are very vibrant. The film was restored, remastered and remixed in 5.1. Plus, it was given a super high definition transfer. Now you have dvd quality with surround sound and three different versions of the film, all with there own unique style with commentary, artwork on the disc, and brilliant animated windows for mere pennies, or even cheaper than the vhs. If you want to buy this and you have a dvd player, I strongly urge you to by the dvd. If you only have a vcr, the vhs looks much better than the older version, and has some features to make it worth your while.

I especially liked how the movie immerses you in the period and the house is so interesting I wish I could have walked through the set.  Maybe it's just England, but the creepy atmosphere really adds to the movie.  I agree with other reviews:  They could have used more of the house to further the story and they could have gotten more in-depth with the story of the woman in black.  This movie would have been a lot better if there had been more story and more scary scenes.  As it is, it's an excellent film, but it just didn't scare me like I wanted.  Maybe that's not saying much. &lt;shrug&gt;  4 stars for atmosphere, minus 1 because I wasn't scared at all.  Just because it didn't scare me doesn't mean it won't scare you.

38916,"""Final Destination,"" directed by James Wong, has an intriguing concept and a strong start. High school student Alex (played by Devon Sawa) has a horrific premonition which is ultimately instrumental in saving the lives of himself and a number of others. But have they cheated death? Or is there an even more horrible fate in store for each of them?I found ""Final Destination"" to be an oddly uneven film. Director Wong helps create a genuinely creepy atmosphere; I especially liked the way ordinary household items and actions are invested with an ominous weight. But some aspects of the film struck me as inappropriately humorous, leading me to wonder if I was watching an intentional spoof or if the filmmakers were just slipping up in moments of ineptitude.I found the tone of the film inconsistent. Were they trying to create a serious psychological drama in which the viewer is meant to care about the characters, or rather should the viewer view Alex and the others as mere fodder for yet another ""slasher""-style horror pic? I was also disappointed by the ending.One of the best aspects of ""Final Destination"" is the strong work by its ensemble cast, which includes Kerr Smith and Kristen Cloke. Sawa in particular makes a sympathetic leading man. His solid performance carries much of the film; he is definitely a young actor worth following. Give ""Destination"" a try.",N/A

Till one day he's stuck in an elivator with a self help person that thinks he's a good guy but that his shallowness is his only flaw. So he helps by putting him in this trance where he can only see the inner beauty in undesirable people. Hal doesn't know this though and finds himself surrounded by beautiful women, at least he thinks he is. Then he meets Rose (Gwyneth Paltrow) who is orca fat but he of course just sees her as well.....Gwyneth Paltrow. They start dating and Rose's dad just happens to be one of Hal's bosses, so he immediately thinks Hal is just seeing her to get close to him to get a raise. His friend played by Jason Alexanda who sees a flaw in every women of course doesn't like Hal seeing Rose one bit either.Through a lot in Shallow Hal you have to imagine that the attractive women he is talking to, well aren't attractive. That's only way the jokes can work. For instance when he first meets Rose he sees her with a giant pair of undies and tells her that she could use that as sail for a sailboat. Plus when he's at a fast food place with her she gets made fun of with these guys saying she ate all the food and Hal immediatly thinks they're talking about him. Well anyway what makes this film sweet is that it's about looking for inner beauty. Which you never get movies about. You just get Freddie Prinze Jr. movies about hunky guy meets gorgeous girl. Shallow Hal is a nice change and the type of romance that you never get. Face it in most movies the fat girl doesn't get the guy and vice versa.The Farrellys who are known for their rauncy scenes, surprisingly keep it pretty light. For instance there's no sperm hair gel ""There's Something About Mary"", no milking a bull ""Kin Pin"", well you get the pont. It's some-what freaky I guess but not rauncy. For instance you got a guy with a spine problem who can only walk on all fours like a dog and Jason Alexanda has a tail, yes a tail.",Shallow Hal
715936,"Yu-Gi-Oh! is one of those anime that, once you get into it, you can't get yourself out of its grasp. This DVD will prove it from the get-go.Yu-Gi-Oh! got started first in 1996 with the manga (comics series), then an initial TV series (which YGO fans dub 'Season 0"") which flopped. Once the Duel Monsters concept was thrown into the story, Yu-Gi-Oh! took off like a rocket!  The sales numbers out of Japan speak for themselves.Finally now, Yu-Gi-Oh! fever has hit the U.S. of A. and it's clearly evident. The TV series took awhile to gain the upper hand over its competition, but KidsWB seemed to know what they were doing, and after a silght timeslot change on Saturday AM, adding a 2nd showing there, and adding the 5-day-a-week showings, it's become a ratings killer, smashing records previously set by Pokemon, and beating out the competition!  The CCG is selling out to the point where it's somtimes impossible to find unless you live in a real huge city with a lot of shops, and just recently, a CD soundtrack (""Yu-Gi-Oh!: Music to Duel By"") has been released. Search this site out for it and snatch that up too, it's good listening.Anyways, this DVD is a good introduction to this now highly popular anime. The first episode I'd already deem a 'classic'...the first of many confrontations between Kaiba (Seto) and Yugi, armed with the ever-powerful EXODIA in his deck!Ep 2 gives us a Duel between Yugi and Pegasus, and Ep 3, the group of friends: Yugi, Joey, Tristan, & T&eacute;a, set off for Duelist Kingdom.The video is probably best veiwed on a hi-definition TV (HDTV) although it still looks fine on normal TVs. (Of course everyone's eyes are different, so, maybe it just looked fuzzy / grainy to my eyes on my TV). The sound is mostly to the center, although the music is digitally recorded in surround-stereo.There's 2 flavors to choose from as far as language goes: English and Spanish. There's also a quick music video here, as well as some monster and character profiles. The dub (English) is great...certainly one of 4Kids' great accomplishments, and they should be proud of their work. Many anime 'purists' are not going to like the fact that there's no Japanese track here (then again, it seems most of them are against dubs in general). I don't mind this at all though, since I've been, as I stated at the start of this review, a casual anime viewer for over 6 years and I'd find the dub more comfortable to sit through. As a previous reviewer here has stated (and I have learned from fans who've seen the Japanese version episodes), that the Japanese variant of Yu-Gi-Oh! is just way too dark, way too controversial for the rest of the world to grasp. After finding out all that I have about Yu-Gi-Oh! in its original format, I'd still probably stick with the English adaption.With all this said, this DVD's worth it. However...there is one minor gripe here that I have. You only get 3 eps. I""ve delved deep into how DVD technology works, and....you could easily get 5-6 eps on a single-layer DVD. That's my only gripe, and unfortunately, I suppose it's the company's way of doing things, and nothing can change that. Other popular anime like DBZ are like this too, and look what's happened to that...its up to Vol 90 for what its worth...go figure!Looks like Yu-Gi-Oh! will be around for some time to come.  Get into it while the getting's good!","Yu-Gi-Oh, Vol. 1 - The Heart of the Cards"
378005,"Essentially a comedy of manners with menace, ""Bob the Gambler"" or ""BOB LE FLAMBEUR"" is a great caper film that also heralded the coming French New Wave. The electric, slang-filled French dialogue written by Auguste le Briton (""Rififi"") has a rhythm and snap that is nicely mirrored in the cool, slick, sometimes sinister unfolding of the story itself. Unfortunately, the dialogue suffers a little in the not quite spot on English subtitles.Director Jean-Pierre Melville pretty much invented the French crime film. After World War II Melville (real last name Grumbach), made films on a shoestring, on location and without stars. He was alone among all French filmmakers who made pictures entirely on his terms. This 1955 film, with a budget about ten times bigger than a typical French film of its time, is also a loving portrait of Paris and an homage to the noirish American films of the 40s and early 50s. Especially John Huston's ""Asphalt Jungle.""Roger Duchesne is Bob, a courtly gangster with a natty style not unlike the late mobster kingpin Gotti, who plans on robbing the Deauville casino. But the film is not so much about the details of Bob's one last heist as it is about playing with the genre itself. Bob is a dark knight with a code of loyalty that conflicts with the amorality of his profession just as the filmmaker Melville toys with the makings of a new film tradition. A terrific film that beats the old and new versions of ""Ocean's Eleven.""This new digital transfer, like all Criterion discs, is superb. Extras include an interview with Daniel Cauchy (""Paulo"") and a radio interview with director Melville, who was so enamored of American culture that he took the last name of Moby Dick's author.",Hole in the Wall / Go ‘Head On
591938,"Wow! I never really thought that Britney Spears would be able to act. She was so believable. The movie was not as teeny-bopper as I thought it would be. And the movie did not have the predictable ending that so many teen movies do. Rape, pregnancy, and under-age drinking are just some of the topics dealt with.Lucy, Kit and Mimi, a group of girlfriends were childhood friends until high school came and they grew apart. As children they promised they would meet at graduation and dig up a hope chest they buried. Although they had grown up, to no avail, they all show up to the box they buried on graduation night. All with different reasons for going, the three girls set off on a roadtrip together. Lucy (Spears) is setting out to find her mother, Kit is running away from home, and Mimi is off to find her fiancee.I do not want to give out the ending but I do know you will be surprised. Even if you do not like Britney Spears as a singer, you'll laugh when she does, cry when she cries and feel happy when she does. A feel good movie with twists and turns that surprise.",N/A
662310,"Believe me, I really wanted to like this movie. I've become a minor Ralph Bates fan from his surprisingly engaging turns in Dr. Jekyll and Sister Hyde and Lust for a Vampire; writer/producer/director Jimmy Sangster has been responsible for more than a handful of my favorite Hammer horrors, in one capacity or another; and I'd always thought the monster looked pretty cool. But while the problematic Lust can be excused since it was taken out of his hands, Horror of Frankenstein is entirely Sangster's baby and, unfortunately, one of his biggest misfires. A virtual remake of Curse of Frankenstein with more overt emphasis on sex (but no nudity), the film begins with student Victor Frankenstein (Bates) drawing the ire of his professor for marking dotted lines on a picture of a naked woman (like those meat charts in butcher shops). Influenced no doubt by the `rebellious youth' trend that was currently sweeping Hollywood, Victor is portrayed as insolent and condescending to his professor as well as his boorish father, a sex maniac who thinks Victor's obsession with science rather than carnality is ""unnatural,"" and threatens to cut off his allowance. In short order, Victor arranges his father's `accidental' death, moves to Vienna to pursue further studies, and impregnates the Dean's daughter. Returning in haste to his castle with loads of laboratory equipment, he proceeds to slowly piece together an artifical man (guided by a numbered chart on the wall) with parts provided by a slimy bodysnatcher (Dennis Price in a wonderfully droll performance, certainly the high point of the movie), who eventually meets his end in Victor's acid bath. In a rare noble (or premeditated?) moment, Victor saves Professor Heiss and his daughter Elizabeth (Veronica Carlson) from some highwaymen, giving him a pretext to draw them into his mad experiment, which angers his jealous, blackmailing maidservant/mistress (Kate O'Mara). There are a few clumsy attempts at humor (e.g. Victor sees the number for ""brain"" on Prof. Heiss's forehead during dinner). But my real problem with Horror of Frankenstein is that while Bates retains the cold, ruthless, even cruel pragmatism of Peter Cushing's characterization, he lacks Cushing's essential charisma and dry gallows wit, which always allowed us to half-believe that his single-minded, sometimes criminal, obsession was really in the service of science, and that the various burgermeisters, priests, and constables that always disrupted his experiments were simply philistines who just didn't understand the higher purpose underlying his work. In contrast, Horror's Victor isn't so much Cushing's bold transgressor as a vicious elitist, callously preying on basically good and innocent folk for nefarious and ultimately meaningless ends (he even electrocutes and dissects his friend and assistant Wilhelm). Dave Prowse (Darth Vader; Patrick Magee's bodyguard Julian in Clockwork Orange) is imposing as the monster, but he's pretty much a sadistic killer out of the gate, generating zero empathy in the viewer, quite unlike Karloff's touchstone performance or even several prior Hammer transplantees (e.g. Michael Gwynn, Freddie Jones). Ms. Carlson looks radiant amidst all the smarmy goings-on, but is given little to do. Even as the bodies pile up, the gore is curiously scant, and both the monster's creation and effervescent demise are anticlimactic at best. For my money, this is the worst of the Hammer Frankensteins, cold, mean-spirited, and banal, and recommended only to completists (who will probably still want this for their collections).Anchor Bay spoils us once again with a superb, definitive DVD release. The anamorphic widescreen transfer is matted to 1.85:1 and features a virtually pristine print with excellent brightness, contrast, sharpness, detail, color balance and saturation, and only some sporadic very light speckling. The Horror of Frankenstein UK trailer is also matted to 1.85:1 and looks equally terrific. The US combo trailer (with Scars of Dracula) is letterboxed but looks dupey and soft, with poor color. Also included are a still/poster/ad gallery of approximately 35 images; Veronica Carlson ""photo album"" of about 55 mostly cheesecake shots; a gallery of 21 of Ms. Carlson's paintings (mostly portraits and still-lifes); relatively comprehensive talent bios of Sangster and Bates; and a 14-minute interview with Ms. Carlson that's interesting but too short to get into any real depth. The audio commentary by Jimmy Sangster and Hammerologist Marcus Hearn is informative, though Hearn has to prod Sangster at times, and they do peter out a bit toward the end. In total, a fine four-star DVD package; too bad the feature attraction only rates a two.",N/A
414152,"Who would have thought that a dark romantic comedy set against a backgroud of corparate politics and sex in the 50's could win best picture in 1960.  Billy Wilder's very dark and sometimes shocking film The Apartment did just that!!!!!  In his best film Wilder scores a knockout.  With telling the story of C.C. Baxter(Jack Lemmon),a loner, working for an insurance company  and his dealings with his bosses and love for an elevator opporator named Fran(Shirley MacLaine).  This movie is almost a satire of corporate America in the 50's.  A story of how people get used and the people who use them.  With a dark wit Wilder pushes the envelope of what people were used to seeing in a comedy, remember this movie was made in 1960.  Now he had made and would make other dark movies, examples Lost Weekend or the film nior classic Double Indemnity.  But most were drama's and none had the wicked satire of the Apartment.

596350,"Just what if a foolproof prerecognition system was in place where you could predict who would commit a violent crime before it happened?  This is 2054, and for the past five years, pre-recognition has been test sampled in Washington D.C.  There are three young people who have proved their prophecies are 100% correct among the three of them.  These predictions are flashed upon screens (in a most scientific manner), a wooden ball drops down a chute with the perpetrator's name on it and another with the name of the victim.  The chief of detectives (Tom Cruise) analyzes these scenes (I thought he was conducting an orchestra!) until he has enough information and then using spectacular transportation machines, gets to the crime scene in time to preempt the crime.  The perpetrator is ""haloed"" and put in some state of suspended animation under guard.  There has not been a murder in D.C. for five years.  Congress is ready to submit a bill to a national referendum to use this method nationwide.The movie opens with a confident, ever-so competent Cruise reporting for duty through the labyrinth of a futuristic paranoia-inducing building.  He quickly gets to work before we are quite aware of what he is doing.  We get a sample of the how and the wherefore of a ""precog"" arrest.  A wife and her lover are spared being brutally murdered by the enraged husband.  End of task.  The action is loud, quick and overwhelming.  The scenes are shot in the harshest light or in grays and blacks.Then to the crux of the matter.  What if there is a mistake? A detective (Colin Farrell) by order of the Attorney General's office has orders to investigate the whole procedure.  He comes on like a bad guy to high-minded Cruise and mentor Max van Sydow.  But isn't he right?  How can a person be convicted of a crime he didn't commit?  Cruise himself is falsely accused, and the chase begins a la ""Fugitive.""  At one point, he kidnaps one of the ""precogs,"" powerfully and touchingly played by Samantha Morton, to help him prove his innocence.""Minority Report"" is a long movie (2 hours 20 minutes), but it didn't seem overly long to me.  I was thoroughly engaged trying to keep up with the non-stop action and changing scenes.  It definitely is a Spielberg movie; who else would have you chase your own eyeballs?  I liked the moral questions that were part of the warp and weave of the movie.  The special effects were not overdone and seemed realistic for a movie set 50 years in the future.

471995,"I love Donna Richardson, and find her videos to be very motivating as well as entertaining.  Her sincere personality just draws you in.This video starts with the toning, which is usually put at the end.  All of the moves are standing, and her key position in this one is the lunge.  There is a lot of focus on the legs, but not really too much on the arms.  The best part of the toning segment is the ab work.  As usual she comes up with some more innovative moves rather than just typical sit-ups.  Overall though, I wish there would've been more reps, because she seems to kind of fly through this portion of the video.However, she makes up for it in the &quot;Kick and Jab&quot; section.  This is an intense work-out that will leave you feeling like you did something really good for your body.  It's not easy though, especially if you have no experience (like myself).  She just jumps right in and does it, so you might get lost and even a little frustrated at first, but you'll get the hang of it in no time.  She does let you know what combination you're gonna do and gives you a few seconds to organize it in your head; such as: jab, jab, bob, upper-cut, hook, jab, bob.  I don't think that's an actual combo, but just an example of what one might sound like.Last is &quot;Dance Party.&quot;  It's the little treat at the end, where it's all about having a good time and not concentrating so much (especially after the &quot;Kick and Jab&quot; routine).  The dances are funk and Latin inspired.  Donna looks terrific and seems to be completely in her element in this segment of the video.  She even does a little rap.

You take, say, the greatest proprietor in the world since Sylvester Stallone or Arnold Schwarzenegger to star in your movie and you already have achieved success.

Check out the extreme stunts that Van Damme pulled off by jumping over a car off of his motorcycle, jumpkicking everybody, jumping off of a bridge, jumping from the rafters of a parade-float building, and much more. Also, watch out for the slow motion of explosions and when Van Damme roundhouse kicks a fat, ugly guy in the face. Hilarity to the extreme. Upmost laughage.

The sappy endings that filled most of the first two seasons were gone, the animation and colors were no longer stiff or quite as washed out and grainy looking, and the voices for the first time sounded clear and perfect.  The stories and episodes were also some of the best, and here it was still a surpirse to see guest stars and guest voices on the show (In the episode HOMER DEFINED, Homer sounds ecstatic when he hears that Magic Johnson has called him up at the Power Plant).This season on top of all of the visual imporvements also showed us some of the most entertaining and memorable episodes.  LISA'S PONY has Homer turning into a zombie doing the graveyard shift at the Kwik E Mart to pay for Lisa's new Pony, a pony he bought for her after ruining her talent show audition.  SEPERATE VOCATIONS has Bart and Lisa switching personalities after taking the Career Aptitute Normalizing Test (or CAN'T) a test to tell you what field you would be best in.  Bart cleans up his act, and is offered a hall monitor job at school after hearing he should be a cop, a disgusted Lisa turns tough after reciving Home Maker instead of blues artist.  FLAMING MOE'S has Homer's own alcohalic drink saving Moe's Tavern, with Moe taking all of the credit and Homer getting nothing.  BART THE LOVER has Bart toying with his lonely teachers feelings by sending her love letters to her, while she thinks it's a man who answered her personal's ad.  THE OTTO SHOW is one of everybody's favorites with Bart's pal Otto losing his bus drivers job and having to live with the Simpsons.  Finally, I MARRIED MARGE has Homer retelling the kids how he proposed to Marge and his struggles to find a job with Bart on the way.  There are PLENTY of other good episodes to talk about in this season such as the softball episode, the episode where German investors buy the power plant and the soapbox derby episode (hopefully will be released in it's original un-cut fashion, even when shown the first couple of times back in 90-91 some scenes were edited out.)The next best thing after this will truly be the next best season of the Simpsons, which is season 4 which also had some excellent episodes, ( DUFFLESS, A STREETCAR NAMED MARGE, HOMER THE HERETIC, ITCHY & SCRATCHY THE MOVIE along with the immortal KAMP KRUSTY.)  If season 3 is the best, then season 4 is a close 2ed  or maybe 1a and 1b.  When this season is released, it might be one of the best DVD sets ever.

This movie is about Toula (Nia Vardolos), a completely Americanized girl from a very traditional Greek family, who finally finds the guy of her dreams,  Ian (John Corbett from Sex and The City).  Ian is the only child of  straight-laced country clubby waspy parents (much to the loudly-expressed dismay of Toula's family). Ian and his family are completely unprepared for the large, boisterous and opinionated clan they're about to join through matrimony.  The planning surrounding the wedding is mesmerizing and hilarious as cultures and future in-laws clash.  The fun is always good natured and the laughs are all big.  Another part of the movie's appeal is watching Toula blossom from a plain Jane dutiful daughter (destined, the family assumed, to old maidhood at the ripe old age of 30) into a sparkling woman who knows what she wants. Based on Vardolos' one woman show and produced by Tom Hanks.

Sinbad and Phil Hartman are both outstanding: two hilarious entertainers doing what they do best - a pleasant comedy.

The film contains several in-jokes that may be of interest to movie buffs: Tom Atkins's character &quot;Nick Castle&quot; and Charles Cyphers's &quot;Dan O'Bannon&quot; are named after veteran directors of horror classics such as &quot;The House on Haunted Hill&quot; and &quot;Return of the Living Dead,&quot; respectively.

Holbrook gives a heartfelt, typically heavy handed performance as Father Malone, who finds his grandfather's journal in the walls of his church.  Tom Atkins is great as always as a sea merchant who picks up hitchhiker Jamie Lee Curtis just as the chaos begins.  Barbeau plays a deejay who broadcasts from a lighthouse, and who can spot the fog as it covers each street in order to guide Tom Atkins to the church.

679665,"Two Can Play At That Game is a very interesting movie.  Whoever says this movie isn't funny hasn't been in a relationship before.  Point Blank.  Through each characters strategic tactics I see myself.  I say holdup hold up ...I ve done that before.  Anthony Anderson basically makes this movie though.  This man is too funny.  He emphasizes the important words in the sentence to get his point across and his voice makes it hilarious.  This is his best acting performance.  Vivica Fox gives women a few unnecessary pointers ( from a man's perspective at least ) but she does keep it real.  Morris Chestnut does excellent as well.  The movie is fast paced as Vivica Fox and Anderson each play their cards at the situation  they are given.  They play it like a chess game and the `rules' are funny at times.  The girlfriends (Tamala Jones, Wendy Racquel Robinson and MoNique )really act like real friends and they have good chemistry together.  The movie wasn't too long and didn't bore me to death as most love stories do.When I first saw it I couldn't really understand why Morris Chestnut was moping around.  `I'm not gonna call, I already called twice, can't be desperate"" lol.  I was like man if you don't quit b!tchin...But then I remembered that Vivica Fox is finer than a mutha.  I'm surprised he didn't cry. Shante takes him through a grueling three day process where she hardly even speaks to him and breaks up with him.  The only useless day was day six.  There was no purpose for it.  The funniest part is at the end when she expects him to be at her house waiting on her with flowers.  I could have told her beyotch please that aint gonna happen.  And then when he didn't show it was just hilarious.  I was like ""ahhh that shhh didn't work"" and then five seconds later she's like ""I know what ya thinking...the shhh didn't work""  By then I was on the flo rolling.  It was so funny.The good thing about this movie is that actors really seemed like they enjoyed playing the roles.  The movie is fast, fun, lighthearted, and entertaining.  A nice classic chill out movie.  The narrating didn't bother me at all.  I recommend seeing this film.",N/A
144998,"Alan Parker has spent much of the last fifteen-odd years complaining about why he hasn't had the respect that he feels he deserves.  Movies like this are the reason.  He's a bloody awful director.He's a bloody awful director not because he doesn't have an eye for a cute project (a gangster movie with splurge instead of blood, and kids instead of adults; a hopeless Dublin soul band who only fail to make good by sheer bad luck) - clearly, he has a producer's sense of what could make money.  But, given every chance, he consistently fails to deliver, thanks to a persistent lack of interest in what it's actually like to live the stories that he tells.  His training in advertising means that he continues a shot, or a scene, for exactly as long as he reckons it will take the least dim person in the audience to get the basic idea, and no longer.  Performances in his films are given no room to breathe.  The editing is brutally economical and consistently curt.  He is not really interested in the people in this film, or for that matter any other film he's made; he just wants to sell the idea to the audience (in the case of this movie, Youthful Exuberance and How Talent Should Be Given A Chance).There might've been an OK movie in this, but Parker's failure to feel anything more than mildly avuncular interest in the characters ruins the whole thing.  Plus I hate the songs, but OK, that's just me.I went to a drama school.  It was nothing like this.  This is like a two-hour-long bad pop video.  And I like pop videos.

Well, that old tape is an utter joke compared to the DVD!!  The concert on DVD was a whole new experience for me and I was blown away with it.Video wise, I was pleasantly surprised at how clear the concert looked overall, given its age and the video technology used back in 1992.Audio wise, I was assuming it would sound comparable to the audio CD and for the most part I wasn't let down.Editing wise, I was a little disappointed that some of the song introductions (by Justin) were edited out.  Of course I understand that the DVD producers did this to save disc time, but I feel that the concert would have flowed a little more smoothly had the intros been left in.But overall, not bad--not bad at all!

It reminded me of the big budget MGM musical's of early Hollywood...completely lavish and full throttle entertainment.  The different use of old and new music was also a breath of fresh air I initially thought I would hate, but found it worked well for this film.That being said, aside from sets and costumes, I didn't see anything in this film that would have it merit best picture nods.

592968,"I'll start this review by stating that I felt the first MIB movie was mediocre at best, probably because I've never been a fan of alien-centered movies.  But the pairing of Will Smith, a genuinely likeable guy and Tommie Lee Jones, one of the best actors in the past 20 years was intriging.  They had great chemistry and the movie was mildly entertaining.MIB2 is a classic ""How can we make more money?  Hire Jones and Smith again and get around to writing a script for a sequel.""  Great special effects, but absolutely no interesting story to follow.  Smith and Jones have the ""we're still getting paid millions of dollars to do this movie, right?"" faces on throughout and what chemistry they had in the first movie has gone away.I like Lara Flynn Boyle and here she is just an alien form of her character on the ""Practice"", but she doesn't bring much to the table.

67590,"The Burnhams are a typical, upwardly mobile family: a father with a well-paid job in advertising, a mother who is a driven real estate sales agent, an angst-ridden teen age daughter who is at an age to despise her parents.  They live in a lovely home with a white picket fence, lovely roses, and a red door.  Everything about them projects an image of success.  And yet-- Lester (Kevin Spacey) hates his advertising job, which makes him feel like a prostitute selling second rate wares to stupid johns.  Caroline (Annette Benning) is frustrated at being second-best in the real estate business.  Daughter Jane (Thorah Birch) finds both of her parents vapid and doubts her own validity as a person--particularly when compared with her beautiful, sexed-up best friend Angela (Mena Suvari.)  Their lives, like the lives of so many others rushing ""to get ahead in the world,"" have become less about actually living than about maintaining and improving upon the appearance of success so prized by society.What is most astonishing about the film is its complete believability.  Speaking as one who has worked a great deal in advertising and sales, I was amazed with the accuracy with which Ball's powerful and darkly funny script captured the lives of those whose values rest exclusively upon external achievement--Lester's growing and barely concealed hatred for advertising and Caroline's constant use of self-help tapes and personal success mantras are truly commonplace in the business world.  Now, if AMERICAN BEAUTY were merely this and nothing more, it would still be an astonishing film.  But it goes considerably further than that--for Lester, suddenly motived by a lust for his daughter's friend Angela, realizes how completely unenjoyable ""keeping up appearances"" has become.  And he explodes the status quo in such a way as to bring every one's petty materialism and mask-like personaes into a sharp, very funny, and pitch-black focus as the shallow and meaningless things they are.  And in the process he both finds and destroys himself forever.The cast is astonishing throughout, with Kevin Spacey the ultimate ""I Can't Take It Any More"" man and wife Annette Benning the ultimate vision of every hard-core sales representative it has ever been my misfortune to meet, a woman determined to ""project an image of success at all times"" even if it kills her.  Thora Birch is a remarkable young performer, as is her boyfriend Wes Bentley, and Mena Suvari is perfectly cast as the youthful beauty for whom Spacey develops an unexpected passion. Mendes' direction is flawless here, and he navagates the both the complicated appearances of success and the personal shallowness it conceals with tremendous clarity, never overplaying his hand in either direction.  Perhaps the most telling bits of the film are among the most subtle, as when the film posits the tiresomely yuppie but nonetheless considerably more honest gay couple next door as more genuine than the Burhams, Caroline's eternal efforts at ego building through motivational tapes, and the way in which Angela (in time honored teenage fashion) niavely attempts to use sex as a weapon to conceal her own insecurities.The film is extremely funny, but it is also ultimately devastating.  A great many people--particularly those who equate ""an image of success"" with successful lives, will despise the film.  But like it or not, AMERICAN BEAUTY's take on the failure on the failure of the American dream is easily the most successful and deadly accurate satire on life in these United States since the equally wicked NETWORK.  This is the real thing, people--and it may be too close to home for many.  Watch it at your own risk.  Strongly, strongly recommended.",Belleza Americana American Beauty  VHS

380922,"The film that validated the French New Wave and consummated the now-ubiquitous cin&eacute;ma v&eacute;rit&eacute;, &quot;fly-on-the-wall&quot; cinematography of modern independent film, Jean-Luc Godard's debut feature Breathless, as influential as it's obviously been (one need only gaze as far back as the extended bedroom scene of 2002's &quot;Late Marriage&quot; to catch a recognizable echo of its ingenuity), still remains as challenging today as it must have been in 1959. Stylistically, the jagged editing technique is what will always call the most attention to itself: Godard chose to snip out small pockets of celluloid almost arbitrarily between most of the action and dialogue, ostensibly to cut down the running time, but effectively to mimic the erratic, shallow attention span of his characters. In turn, the deliberateness of this device tends to distract from the essential simplicity of Godard's narrative, about a killer on the run (Jean-Paul Belmondo) who plots to flee the country with his Parisian lover (Jean Seberg). Revisiting this quaint work of artistry today reveals that Godard, in his vision of existentialist ennui and contemporary youth, has never really been intellectually surpassed in this subject matter by any subsequent film directors. For one matter, his picture's visual impudence alone renders most other cin&eacute;ma v&eacute;rit&eacute; timid in comparison. It's one of the few films of its kind that actually dares to appear as clumsy as possible.",Breathless A Bout de Souffle  VHS

523528,"More recently, the critics took aim and fired collectively at Michael Bay's Pearl Harbor.  One of the criticisms was the film's (alleged) lack of attention to historical fact.  Indeed, Michael Bay took some liberties with Pearl Harbor.  He altered history.With Gladiator, history was not altered, but put through a  paper shredder and completely re-written.  Early in the film, the audience is asked to go along with the most ludicrous of propositions.  It goes like this.Caesar, (played by Richard Harris) is weary of war and conquest.  He would like to die knowing that Rome will be reformed.  Thus, he makes known his desire to make Marcus Aurelius, (played by Russell Crowe) the new Emperor.  He would rather have a soldier be Emporer than his own son.  Why?  Because he wants to give power ""back to the people.""Anyone who knows anything about Roman history ought to be ashamed for swallowing this whopper.  The real Caesar didn't give a rat's behind about giving power to the people.  One has to get past this ludicrous idea from the get go, or spend the rest of the movie scratching his head.And the battle scenes?  Well they  are so obviously computer animated,  I felt l as though I was watching  Rogger Rabbit vs. Ben Hur.And what's more, the basic plot seems stolen straight from the Mad Max movies and placed in an Acient Roman setting.  The hero's family is murdered, and so our hero must rise up against seemingly unstoppable forces to get revenge.  Sound familiar?I can agree that Russell Crowe is a fine actor, as are the other players in this film.

679561,"JEEPERS CREEPERS had so much potential. The first fifteen or twenty minutes of the movie were enthralling. The banter between the brother and sister was great, and rather realistic and other than the profanity reminded me of conversations I have had on long drives. The way one sees the Winnebago turn a corner in the backseat window and the BEATNU truck suddenly come up behind the sibling pair is a classic piece of cinematography. The way the film continues to build up with some more DUEL-type suspense is great. However, once the brother and sister check out the pipe behind the old church, the film starts to fall apart.The movie slows down a lot after that and I found myself fastforward viewing through the slowest moments. A lot of elements are introduced to the story that have little bearing on the plot. And the song, what in the world does the song Jeepers Creepers have to do with the movie? Nothing as far as I could tell.The Creeper itself may not have been that impressive of a monster. However, I found it nice for once to have a horror movie where the horror was a real monster. Unfortunately, this monster is indestructible. That makes the film rather disappointing. What's the point in fighting a battle (or watching a movie) where nothing, absolutely nothing, can be gained? I mean, come on, even Superman has kryptonite and demons can be exorcised; every creature has to have some weakness. But apparently, the Creeper doesn't.

As Molly makes her rags-to-riches transition, her beautiful &quot;nouveau riche&quot; costumes are given an impressive digital enhancement; this is especially evident in the party sequence featuring Reynolds' famous red dress with the million feathers sewn on the top.

She is recovering from a hip injury, and cannot reach out for help beyond screaming, and ringing an alarm hooked up the the elevator.The story is in black and white, and this adds to the mood, like in Alfred Hitchcocks ""Psycho"".  Sure, they could've used color for this 1964 film, but you'll see for yourself why the lack of color, matches the noir and bizarre mood here.DeHavilland is over-dramatic, but superb too, as the ""Lady"" of the title, her facial expressions are so fitting of her consuming exasperation at the frustrating situation.  You can feel the sweat as she swelters in the summer heat, trapped helplessly.  DeHavilland also has her son Malcomb,  from whom she ponders a letter while trapped.  She finds out that sonny boy,  whom she idolizes with a devout reverence, hates her.  She agonizes over his plea ""Release me from your love"", leading to the great exclamation ""I AM a MONSTER!""Wait, it gets even better.As DeHavilland rings her alarm relentlessly, hoping someone will save her, she attracts the attention of an old pathetic semi-mute wino, wandering around the neighborhood.

He leaves, and comes back with a shady lady played by Ann Southern, who further ransacks the house.  DeHavilland can't believe what's happening.

When this trio of trouble enters, the real show begins, as they let Southern and the wino know, they're in charge.  All sorts of games begin, especially wild, is the psycho-sexual headgames an insidious Caan inflicts upon DeHavilland, as he enters the ""cage"" and starts in on her son, and the kind of mother he speculates she is.  Caan is slimy, sinister and completely lacking in moral compunction, as are his two cohorts.  You will watch this with a very uneasy feeling and you will be left with that feeling after viewing this as well.  For a movie that was released in 1964, it is even shocking by TODAY'S standards.  Way ahead of it's genre in that era, it stands up to the test of time quite well as a high quality, unique suspense thriller.""Lady In A Cage"" is a sad social commentary about isolation, cruelty, and dysfunctional sociopaths that is so far ahead of it's time,  it must be seen, to be believed.  The graphically gory and shocking ending, only adds to the surreal nightmarish feel of what has led up to the culmination of all the gruesome events of a horrid day.

48551,"I first saw Vertigo in the early 80s and was quite impressed although I was just a youngster.  The restoration has made Vertigo more crisp and colorful and a better viewing experience.  The DVD has sort of a patchwork commentary track with the architects of the resurrection along with producer Herbert Coleman and then suddenly other discordant people speak up like Art Director Henry Bumstead and Kim Novak.  Don't get me wrong, the added commentaries were insightful and well done, but it kind of disrupted the conversation that the primary players were having.  My guess is that the elderly Coleman must have rambled during parts of the movie.  He sometimes didn't understand the content of the restoration team's questions and would cut them off.  But Coleman & Company do share a lot of gems along the way.Another feature of the film is the making-of documentary that was a pure pleasure.  I'm a believer that a DVD needs a lot of extras and Vertigo certainly has plenty to make it worth the purchase.",N/A

I just happened to watch the movie recently, and I just couldn't stand it.Early in the movie, Rhett says to Scarlett, in effect, ""you and me, baby, we're a pair of lousy people, you're made for me babe!"" So why on earth does anybody care to watch nearly four hours of a couple of lousy people doing really lousy things? I seriously don't get it at all!But Rhett is too hard on himself, he ain't nearly the equal of Scarlett. Four hours of listening to Scarlett whine and cry at the drop of a hat - Christ I needed some earplugs!I'll have to say, the second hour, involving the burning of Atlanta was the best of the movie. In the first hour, we see Scarlett as a spoiled rich brat entirely unprepared for war. In the second hour, we see her, eventually, pull together some amount of strength. She's kicking and screaming every moment, but she does, finally help deliver the child. And we see Scarlett, just before the intermission, give her famous, ""with God as my witness, I'll never grow hungry again."" So, I'm thinking, hey, I guess Scarlett is going to stop whinning and bawling every damn second. And I figured Scarlett was going to be transformed into a likable character with her war experience to be her impetis to transformation.But NOOOoooo, that's not it at all! What we see is Scarlett continue to whine and cry at every instant, only it is now more calculated. Just designed to get try to get her every whim. The entire second half was just unwatchable.

602293,"Red Dragon (Brett Ratner, 2002)It is the rare film that succeeds not because of its director, but in spite of him. The latest of such films is Red Dragon, a thriller helmed by a comedy director (Ratner is best known for the Jackie Chan vehicle Rush Hour and its sequel). It also succeeds in spite of there already being a perfectly capable adaptation of the book in Michael Mann's wonderfully impressionist Manhunter (1986). It succeeds for one reason: The Silence of the Lambs.Ratner reprised most of the cast from Silence who also show up in Red Dragon (Scott Glenn is replaced by Harvey Keitel, who is capable but a bit jarring), and adds on Ed Norton in the main role of Will Graham, Crawford's golden boy before the advent of Clarice Starling. Graham, who retired from the FBI after almost being killed by Lecter, is brought back in as a consultant by Crawford (Keitel, in one of his few ""normal"" roles). Graham quickly becomes obsessed with the case, much to the chagrin of his wife (Mary Louise Parker) and child (Tyler Patrick Jones, last seen in Minority Report). Graham is tracking a serial killer known as The Tooth Fairy (Ralph Fiennes), a man with his own demons to overcome (one of them voiced by an uncredited Ellen Burstyn).Made with the lush budget and relaxed atmosphere one would expect from the newest film in a billion-dollar franchise, Ratner was able to play this one a lot closer to the vest than Michael Mann was when he filmed Manhunter back in 1986. But Mann, showing the mark of a great director, took his lack of budget and made a film that is more impressionist than it is true to the source material (not that staying true to the source material of Thomas Harris makes for good flicks; both Mann and Demme departed from the book when necessary, while Ridley Scott stuck to his guns, and the writing, in the dismal Hannibal). So while comparing the two is inevitable, it's like comparing apples and oranges. Yeah, Ed Norton is pound for pound a better actor than William Pedersen, but the Will Graham of Manhunter is a far different psychological beat than the Will Graham of Red Dragon. And the Hannibal Lecter played by Brian Cox is a different beast than the Lecter played, once again, by Anthony Hopkins.And it is in Lecter that the movie finds its greatest failing. Hopkins, here, suffers from what I call Freddy Syndrome. Did you ever notice that, as the Nightmare on Elm Street series progressed, and Freddy Krueger became a more popular character than the kids he was slicing and dicing, he became a nicer guy? He went from an almost unintelligible ""I'm gonna kill you slow!"" while pursuing Nancy in the first flick to tossing off comic-book style one-liners in the King's English by the third movie. (And as a physical marker, note that his sweater gets cleaner in every film. Really.) In a few short years, Freddy Krueger went from nightmarish serial killer to witty raconteur, the kind of guy you'd invite to a Hugh Hefner roast, as long as he put on some pancake makeup. Hopkins has the same problem. In Silence and Manhunter, you were never allowed to forget that Hannibal Lecter is not a nice guy; he's a sociopath with a taste for human flesh, and given the chance, he'd rather dine on ladyfingers than talk to them. But here, Anthony Hopkins plays the role in a far more charming manner; in the opening scene, when he attempts to kill Graham, you expect him to say something along the lines of  ""sorry, old chap, rules of the game you know."" (And what you actually get isn't all that far off.)It's worth seeing for Ed Norton's performance, as is every Ed Norton film to date, but watch Manhunter first to get an idea of what it could have been-and, actually, what it once was. ***",N/A
537186,"&quot;Titanic&quot; meets &quot;Tora! Tora! Tora!&quot; early in &quot;Pearl Harbor&quot; - validating the comments of other reviewers about this film exploiting cliches and past cinematic successes.  As this grafting of epic romance onto dramatised history approaches its expected conclusion and the unsuspecting audience senses the end credits, the film launches into a reprise of &quot;Thirty Seconds Over Tokyo&quot;.&quot;Pearl Harbor&quot; is a formula movie in which new ideas are hard to find, but who cares?  It is very entertaining and well-made.  Its tribute to the spirit of the times is largely satisfying.  It has a good cast, with the biggest names in supporting roles, including Jon Voight's portrayal of Franklin D. Roosevelt, Alec Baldwin's of Lt Colonel Doolittle, and Dan Aykroyd's of a US Navy codebreaker.  Clever market-orientated art direction and design give it a period look extending to 1940s-style brassieres-but perhaps shying clear of alienating modern tastes by going all the way with 1940s hair styles.Bonus materials in the DVD package include a &quot;making of&quot; documentary with insights into the state-of-the-art stunts and special effects.  Among the most impressive special effects is a convincing integration of computer graphics with the actual location of Pearl Harbor and with real sets, ships and aircraft.  Modern buildings are edited out frame-by-frame.  The &quot;making of&quot; documentary shows just how life-like computer-generated people, aircraft and ships have become.

Indeed, I think I had a better viewing experience with the DVD than in the really rather nice theater I saw the film in.That said, Disc 2 was a MAJOR disappointment. Much of the content is just rehashed material from the film itself, and the interface is supremely irritating. Indeed, while first looking at it with two friends who are also great fans of the books and film, mere minutes of being assaulted by this lousy interface had everyone complaining loudly. There is no actual menu, and no direct way to access any of the supplementary material. To get to anything, you have to navigate through a series of screens relating to the story, and since nothing is labeled as to what it actually contains, you have to poke around endlessly to find anything interesting.Also, there isn't a lot of interesting supplementary content for an adult audience. Most of it is geared toward children. While this is a children's story, it actually has more adult fans, and the content should have much better accounted for all ages.Finally, the packaging of the set is horrible, flimsy cardboard. I would expect the outer box to last two seconds flat in the hands of children... and I don't expect it to last a terribly long time in the hands of adults.In conclusion, this is a superb movie superbly transferred to DVD, packaged in a really lousy boxed set that I think you'll be very disappointed with if you want anything at all more than the movie itself.",N/A

For THE TINGLER he had ""Percepto,"" and it was a lulu: randomly selected seats in the theatre were wired with a small motor, and at a peak moment in the film these motors came to life and literally gave your bottom a buzz!  But unless you happen to have a really warped sense of humor plus some mechanical apptitude, you'll have to forego the ""Percepto"" effect and settle for one of the most weirdo stories to come down the street.A doctor (Vincent Price) is studying the effects of fear.  In the process, he finds that fear causes a nasty, worm-like creature to grow inside the human body along the spine.  Release your fear by screaming, and the creature is destroyed; if for some reason you cannot scream, however, the creature merely grows larger and larger and kills you by crushing your spine.  What the good doctor really wants, of course, is to lay his hands on one of these critters--and when a man murders his deaf-mute wife by scaring her to death, Dr. Vince gets his chance.  Eventually ""The Tingler"" escapes into a movie theatre, and the seat-buzzing begins!Price and company give it their all, and the film is as enjoyable as only schlock horror can be.

92897,"This is simply a great mob movie. Based upon the best selling book, ""Wiseguy"", by Nicholas Pileggi, it traces the rise and fall of ""gansta"" wannabe turned government informant, Henry Hill. Skillfully directed by Martin Scorsese, this film with its all star cast, megawatt performances, and period music soundtrack packs quite a wallop to the senses. Named 1990's best film by the Los Angeles, New York, and National Society of Film Critics, it garnered six Academy Award nominations and earned Joe Pesci an Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor.In the 1950s, a preteen Henry Hill (Christopher Serrone) began his career as a ""gansta"" wannabe on the mean streets of East New York, where a small Italian American community thrived. Working with Paul Cicero's (Paul Sorvino's) crew, he worked his way up, doing the penny ante, gofer stuff, until he began more heavy duty involvement. As a young man, Henry Hill (Ray Liotta) took to his life in the underworld like a fish takes to water. He married a nice, jewish girl whom he turned into a shrewish girl, as he lived the life he wanted. His wife, Karen (Lorraine Bracco), also became entranced by the perks available to a mobsterHenry teamed up with Jimmy ""The Gent"" Conway (Robert DeNiro) and Tommy DeVito (Joe Pesci). Together they stole, lied, cheated, and killed their way through life, until they got wacked or got caught. When Henry, against the express advice of Paul Cicero, got involved with Jimmy in the 1970s cocaine drug trade, it was the beginning of the end for him and Jimmy. The film skillfully chronicles the rise and fall of Henry Hill from wiseguy to goverment informant in the witness protection program..It is amazing that the actor playing young Henry Hill, Christopher Serrone, resembles Ray Liotta so much, right down to the piercing hazel eyes. He gives a terrific performance as young Henry, expressing all the joie de vivre that young Henry had over being associated with mobsters. Ray Liotta, as the adult Henry Hill, gives an outstanding performance. The viewer senses his absolute love for the life that he lives. He clearly enjoys all the perks of a mobster, his only regret being that he could never be a ""made"" guy, because he was not fully Italian, as his mother was Sicilian but his father was Irish.Robert DeNiro is wonderful as Jimmy Conway, low key yet powerful. Joe Pesci gives an over the top performance as the wild, volatile, and totally crazy Tommy DeVito, an out of control wiseguy who has no redeeming value as a human being. He is a guy who does not think twice about killing someone over something trivial. Paul Sorvino is excellent as the mob boss who is all about the family and plays it the old fashioned way. Lorraine Bracco gives the performance of her life as Karen Hill, a woman besotted by the life of a mobster's wife, until she realizes that girlfriends are an expected part of that life. She is sensational.This is simply a great mob movie. It is a film that the viewer will watch again and again.

50781,"Just one glance at Robert J. Mulligan's 1962 film and you will see why it (unlike many of today's contenders) is a true American masterpiece.Based on Harper Lee's novel of the same name, this film narrates the realities of growing up in the south during the depression while watching her father defend a black man accused of raping a white woman.The difficult subjects of racism and the legal system are addressed in a timeless response that does not fade despite comparatively more advanced filming techniques or altering legal realities.As the Anglo protagonist Atticus Finch, Gregory Peck delivers one of the most excellent character performances of his film career. His task in the throes of segregation is a gloomy prospect (with judges and jurors predisposed to bias against your client from day one) but Finch trudges stoically on throughout the screenplay.This imparts to his children the importance of standing up for what you believe in and being an open minded person that tries to treat everybody fairly. Certainly the family faces retribution from narrow-minded community members, but the children learn those attacks are a small price to pay for the greater good of a society without bias and injustice. It is better to place yourself on the line for your principles than to say/do nothing and let things continue as they had always occurred.That in itself would be a powerful statement for a film produced during resurrection of the American civil rights movement, but it also tackles the biases surrounding people with disabilities in the character of Boo Radley.As the town ""idiot"", he is an enigma to the local children--who spend a considerable amount of time in the film fascinated by the rumors surrounding this man---until he becomes the one who saves Scout from vicious attack related to her father's case.  Like Jim, he represents the ""Mockingbird""-entities who do not harm anything else and therefore should be treated with kindness.Finally, Scout's proto-feminism in wondering why she would be treated differently than her younger brother foreshadows the resurrection of the feminist movement in America. Despite Atticus's comparatively progressive stance on race issues, he unwittingly bought into sexist assumptions about gender roles.",N/A

They invite her to join them with everlasting life by drinking some of the water,but she can't decide,so they leave her some water and say they'll be back in 50 or 100 years. 100 years later they return to a town full of cars and sidewalks trying to locate her,they find her,they find her grave. On the grave 'dear wife and mother',later they discover she gave the water to the frog that she carried in her pocket. For me very spooky and haunting back then. Tried to remember the title of this movie,but so long ago until the remake,too late,oh well.",Tuck Everlasting 1981  VHS

Subtitles: English and Spanish. Special features include: Select filmographies for director and cast; trailers for this and other features; menus and scene selection; photo gallery.DRACULA: THE DARK PRINCE (a.k.a. DARK PRINCE: THE TRUE STORY OF DRACULA, from USA Networks) stars Rudolf Martin, Jane March, Roger Daltry, and Peter Weller. Shot on location in Romania with a largely Romanian crew.The DVD's cover art has very little resemblance to the feature. This is not a vampire movie, though at times it's dark and bloody.Martin (Vlad III) and March (Lidia) have many truly sublime moments in DARK PRINCE. The performances overall are well worth wading through the production's few awkward moments. Michael Sutton (Radu) and Christopher Brand (Bruno) add welcome depth with their supporting roles, as does Weller (Fr. Stefan) certainly.March's Lidia is almost distractingly modern in her distain for Dracula's methods, until considering noble daughters might well have been shielded from such political realities. It's Martin's portrayal of the medieval ruler that lingers, however. Coldly ruthless, commanding, born and trained to rule, weary of the necessary dancing with the Roman and Orthodox churches. Yet humanity shines through when he smiles at his infant child.Well done finale, worth the price of admission.",N/A

That's not to say his films aren't entertaining.They most certainly are,and I think this film is a nice tribute to the man who never gave up,despite the cold-shoulder he got from mainstream Hollywood .It's too bad he is famous world-wide now,and he isn't here to know it.Maybe he is up there,dressed in his angora wings,sitting on a satin pillow,smiling down on those of us who have come to love his weird little films.",N/A
578704,"If someone you know is a serious student of filmmaking, there will be no better gift for him or her than &quot;The Stanley Kubrick Collection&quot; on DVD. My partner Greg gave this collection to me for Christmas, and as a longtime Kubrick fan I couldn't be happier. In addition to pristine transfers of Kubrick's last eight films, there is also a ninth disc: An extremely well-produced, 2 and  hour documentary, &quot;Stanley Kubrick: A Life In Pictures,&quot; which will have any Kubrick fan salivating. I was genuinely startled by the amount of archival footage of Kubrick, going as far back as early childhood, that the producers were able to dig up. It's a stunning achievement, considering the director's fiercely private nature. For anyone who wants to learn how Kubrick honed his craft, how he did what he did, how his films were received as well as how we now consider his work in retrospect, &quot;Stanley Kubrick: A Life In Pictures&quot; is absolutely invaluable.However, I still believe that Warner Bros. deserves the contempt of every Kubrick fan in the United States for ignoring our pleas and failing to release an unaltered Director's Cut of &quot;Eyes Wide Shut.&quot; At the very least the studio could have included the unaltered scene in question as an Easter Egg! I almost reduced my rating of this collection to FOUR stars for this reason; but as many people as possible need to see these films, to learn about Kubrick's life and work, because we will never again see a director with his singular artistic vision. So I give this collection FIVE stars, while simultaneously fixing the execs at Warner Bros. with a blistering glare.",N/A

Everything about this movie from the writing to the cast works, and works perfectly. This has not just one Willy Loman, but a bunch. The trials of four sad salesmen of dubious real estate and their manager (brilliantly played by Kevin Spacey) are detailed in this wonderful film. Based on David Mamet's own Broadway play, it feels like a play with its simple sets and its intense screenplay. Ed Harris, Jack Lemmon, and Al Pacino are all great in this film, along with a powerful appearance by Alec Baldwin. This is America, the great hustle for a buck story. What will men be driven to do when their backs are against the wall. Thee are no heroes in this movie, but anyone who sees this film becomes a winner. This is a movie worth owning and belongs on any list of essential movies. With better extras I would have given the disc set five stars. The movie, however, is still worth owning.",N/A
585453,"If you want to see a good film, see ""SPIDER-MAN"", if you want to see a great film, see ""INSOMNIA"". The only reason I gave both 5 stars is because ""SPIDER-MAN"" is good film not because it's missing things, but because there are things that could have been added to make a great film. Do you see where I'm going with this?Anyways, ""SPIDER-MAN"" is about Peter Parker(Tobey Maguire), he's pretty much the school nerd, he's also an orphan who lives with his aunt and Uncle Ben. One day, he goes on a field trip with a group of other highschool kids to a spider exibit. amongst the group of kids is the most popular and beautiful girl he has met(Kirsten Dunst). She points out that one of the super genetic spiders is missing, but no one is listening as the group progresses. It's that same time, that Peter gathers the nerve to talk to the girl(It's been a month and half, I hardly remember thier names, so bear with me).""For the school paper?"" Peter asks, holding up a camera.""Sure,"" she responds. As he takes the pictures, the missing spider spirals down on his hand and bites down, inserting its super genetic powers into his DNA.After a day or so Peter begins to explore these powers. He knows he could use them on criminals, but at first he chooses not to. Then suddenly, his Uncle Ben is shot and killed and Peter devotes his life to stopping crime as, Spider-Man, but he is taken the wrong way and is thought to be a criminal.Throughout the movie Peter budgets his time as himself and Spider-Man. Soon, the girl forms a relationship with BOTH Spider-Man AND Peter. Also, around the same time, Spider-Man meets his rival, Green Goblin, who really is the father of Peter's best friend. But he doesn't know.Soon it becomes a deadly game of sabotage and The Green Goblin tempts him to fight by putting his aunt in the hospital and taking hostages. Spider-Man only figures out who The Green Goblin is until the last fight.So, overall, ""SPIDER-MAN"" is a good movie at the fullest, but not a great movie. The only other way to explain this is that ""SPIDER-MAN"" is a blockbuster, not an Academy Award-Winner.",N/A
198988,"This is my favorite Marx Brothers comedy. Absolutely nuts from beginning to end, they kicked out all the stops on this one, with one of the best and truest satirical jabs at jingoism and militarism ever put on film. ""Freedonia's Going to War"" and everyone is singing about it!There are so many great bits in this one: Harpo & Chico battling the lemonade vendor; Groucho & the inimitable Margaret Dumont ""That covers a lot of ground, matter of fact you cover a lot of ground, I hear they're going to tear you down and put up an office building... can't you see what I'm saying, I love you!""; the 3 brothers dressed in nightshirts with groucho moustaches (Gad they looked alike)doing the mirror pantomime; Groucho insulting & taking umbrage with Louis Calhern's Ambassador Trentino ""Headstrong?

677398,"Science fiction tv series often find it difficult to maintain a high level of quality in their first year, and while FARSCAPE has had some inconsistency in this regard, the ninth DVD of the first season of the series brings us two of the best episodes in the first season to this date.The first episode on the DVD, ""Through the Looking Glass,"" offers the vision of a Moya split into four different realities through the act of the Leviathan's attempting to Starburst without enough energy to make the trip successfully.  Each of the realities has variances from the norm that make the situation more difficult.  Crichton manages to find gateways or doorways between the realities, and attempts to bring the four Moyas back together again.  But there is another force at work here, a force that is ripping gouges in the realities of the various Moyas, and perhaps this is the biggest threat of all...or not.  This episode brings together some of the best characterisation and acting in the series so far, presenting as it does two marvellous ""dinner on Moya"" scenes - one at the beginning, one at the end - that truly frame the differences in the crew at the two different points of the story.  It is an episode where Chiana truly begins to fit in on Moya (in her own way, of course), and where we get to see a different side of Rygel and the others as well.The second episode is ""A Bug's Life,"" the first season episode that leads into the story arc that wraps up the season which will change the lives of the characters forever.  When Larraq and his fellow PK Commandos commandeer Moya to transport a single crate to the Peacekeeper Gammak base in the Uncharted Territories, Crichton and Aeryn masquerade as PKs, while D'Argo, Zhaan, and Rygel pretend to be prisoners once more.  But when Rygel and Chiana's curiosity get the better of them and they open the crate, they release a virus on board that threatens the entire crew...and may cost one of Moya's crew's life.  This episode is a marvellous morality play that deals with the issues of trust, and has a wonderfully paranoid feeling to it.  Heck, ""evil Crichton"" is worth seeing this one for!Both episodes have some extended footage here that adds to the stories in general, and ""A Bug's Life"" is notable in this regard, featuring a good scene between Aeryn and Larraq that explains much of the personality of our favourite female PK.  Thh additional footage in ""Through the Looking Glass"" is also worth the effort of seeing, and provides a bit of insight into the major characters, but doesn't really enhance what we've seen to this point.  What would have made this DVD really exceptional would have been a commentary version of each of these episodes, since both are psychological works that really would have been enhanced by such material.  There is a nice Profile on Lani Tupu's work here, although there was less time than I would have liked to see devoted to Pilot in this, but such is life and all.With two of the best episodes of the first season on it, this ninth FARSCAPE DVD is a good buy as each of these episodes is worth viewing more than once.  A few more extras on the DVD wouldn't have hurt it, but I think that this DVD is still worth the price.","Farscape Season 1, Vol. 9 - Through the Looking Glass / A Bug's Life"

Like others have said, I wish both versions would have been included on this DVD, since I watched the original version with the voice-over almost 100 times before the director's cut hit in '93.  Even with the voice-over, I remember that I didn't even really like this movie the first time I saw it on VHS in 1983 (like many, the movie is confusing if you only see it once).  Thankfully, I was persistent and repeated viewings have made this my all-time favorite flick.

27874,"This movie is a blaxploitation classic. Its only rival could be considered to be 'Superfly' with Ron O'Neil. In my opinion ""The Mack"" is more enjoyable. Max Julien became 'Goldie' in 1973 as he stepped into this role.His desire is simple...""to be the coldest pimp in history! People are gonna be talkin' about Goldie like they were talking about Jesus!"" he declares. And he sets out on his quest to do just that. It doesn't necessarily explain how he came to secure all of the women and the money, but we see him throwing money in the air and immediately surrounded by his ghetto fabulous trappings. Soon he is running a business in which he teaches his ladies how to steal, deceive and ""always remain a lady"". He even goes so far as to run a show at a planetarium to show how necessary it is to control a woman's body and not just her mind.The dvd includes a documentary into how ""The Mack"" was made. It shows that it was partially financed by the notorious Ward brothers (real ... and hustlers) who had small roles in the film. It also showed that there is in fact a message to the ""Mack"" and what its intents and purpose was. It would be easy to dismiss this movie as a 70's black movie about ... women.

290277,"Rome Adventure is the ultimate romance for all of us incurably romantic souls. Beautifully filmed on location, it's another fine example of Delmer Daves' sensitivity and craftsmanship as a director. If the dialogue is at times arch, it matters little when played out with the conviction that Troy Donahue and Suzanne Pleshette bring to their roles. Watch them during the scene in the horse-drawn carriage as they exchange those small gestures to indicate their attraction to each other - was romance ever better expressed in a film?You either like Troy Donahue or you don't. I happen to think he's very convincing in Rome Adventure as a young man in love. With his warm speaking voice, he has a nice way of minimizing the embarrassing aspects of the script, and he appears totally committed in his scenes to the act of listening as well as speaking. He exudes an aura of integrity. I believe these are the qualities that made Donahue a &quot;heartthrob&quot; - quite apart from his good looks.The other actors don't arouse such strong feelings in an audience either for or against, so suffice it to say they are all excellent, and that Suzanne Pleshette is even better than that!The working title for Rome Adventure was Lovers Must Learn.

463416,"This dark, reflective thriller is sure to delight viewers who require more than just eye candy in their movie diets. It is not the most original of films, and it's probably more predictable than its makers thought it would be, but the brilliant acting and directing easily overcome these flaws.In the middle of a Minnesota winter, three small town men stumble on the wreckage of a small aircraft. There are no survivors. While looking around, the guys find a duffle bag which contains over four million dollars. You can sit in your easy chair and think what you'd do with it, but if this actually happened, what would you really do? This is the question the movie poses.The trio, which is composed of two brothers, Hank and Jacob Miller [Bill Paxton and Billy Bob Thornton], and their friend Lou [Brent Briscoe], hash out a solution. Hank will keep the duffel bag until spring arrives, when they assume the wreck will be discovered. If no one mentions the money, they will then divide it. This is the simple plan, which soon begins to unravel.There are several interesting themes here. One is about money. What happens when people who are stuck in a humdrum life suddenly find a means of escape? Another is greed. Do very high stakes bring out this vice in people, even if they think they don't have it? Then there is the burden of having to keep a very big secret. After all, most people have a hard time keeping little ones.We have come to expect fine performances from Billy Bob Thornton. He dazzled in Primary Colors, The Apostle, and, of course, Sling Blade. He was the only character in Armageddon who thought he was supposed to actually act. A Simple Plan is his best movie to date. His Jacob is simpleminded on the surface, yet by the end, we are left thinking that he may really be the brightest one in the bunch. Bill Paxton, who usually is seen as background to special effects in fare like Titanic, shows here an intelligence and a presence no one knew he had. As Hank's devious, plotting wife, Sarah, Bridget Fonda puts another notch in a fine acting career.Director Sam Raimi has a cult following due to his stylish work in horror movies, such as Evil Dead and Army of Darkness. This is his first foray into a straight thriller, and he does an impeccable job.The photography is above average. The bleakness of the winter landscape mirrors the plight the characters find themselves in. In this aspect, the movie is very much like the Coen brothers remarkable Fargo, which is probably still in most video stores.While some people will be put off by the seriousness of the story, which is both thriller and character study, other will find it both rewarding and engrossing. The ending is not happy, but can any story involving greed end otherwise?",N/A

434028,"Jane Campion is a brilliant director who can direct a film and convey much with a minimum of language and action. Her film, &quot;The Piano&quot; is a testament to that innate talent. This would lead one to believe that directing an adaptation of a Henry James novel would be a natural segue for her.While this is a lush and beautiful period piece, the problem with it is that it is somewhat dull. Despite stellar performances by Barbara Hershey and the supporting cast, the main star, Nicole Kidman, is out of her league, though she is a luminous beauty and has some acting ability. The problem is that her performance lacks the presence or depth necessary to transcend the material and make this a truly interesting film. She just is not good enough an actress to be able to carry this type of storyline and engage the viewer in the lead role of wealthy expatriate, Isabel Archer.Moreover, while John Malkovich gives a wonderful performance as the malevolent Gilbert Osmond, he is decidedly miscast as he is simply not charismatic enough to make it believable that Isabel Archer would throw caution to the wind over such an unattractive and, decidedly, sinister man.

227843,"'Aliens' is definitely one of those rare cases where the sequel is heaps better than the original.  The first in the series was undoubtedly seminal - who could forget when the alien bursts out of the astronaut's chest? - but this uses all the ingredients of the first film and emphasises them tenfold.  Agent Ripley (Weaver) awakes only to discover that she's been in hyper-sleep so long, lost in space, that everyone she knew back on earth is now dead.  As it turns out, there's more aliens abroad, and before you can say 'oh no not again' Ripley's taken off with a motley crew of army-astronauts to take a look at a planet where a human colony disappeared, and there's rumour of alien interference.  If this appears clich&eacute;d then it's a great credit to director/writer James Cameron that he adds just about every element possible to make this not only completely credible but also scary, exciting and even human.Cameron replaces one alien with a whole colony, good special effects with better special effects and a bigger cast that's every bit as impressive as the original crew from 'Alien'.  It would be impossible to pick out the best element here, no doubt it will be different for different people depending on what they prefer.  However, it's probable that this wouldn't have been half of what it was had not Sigourney Weaver been in the lead role.  She epitomised the female action hero, perhaps even the action hero, with her role as Agent Ripley.  Strong when she needs to be, touch, bitter and now thanks to Cameron a maternal instinct in the shape of Newt, the only survivor of the lost colony and the child that Ripley never got to have.  It is this that will hold the interest of many and it's a rare action movie that can keep you on the edge of your seat one moment and then feel intensely for a lost little girl, who thankfully is a very good actress.In short, this is a real classic of its genre and comes highly recommended even to those who aren't a fan of the action flick.

The plot is a mix of the Jeff Goldblum ""The Fly"" and the spiderman comic books.There were parts where the execution was fun and interesting but more often than not I felt I had seen it all before ... in better movies. I had hopes for Akroyd due to his work in previous Horror/Comedies and even a few dramatic performances. Unfortunately, he and all the other actors play it for high drama.

11936,"I'd never even heard of this musical until I saw the DVD case the other day.  By today's standards, this is a really strange animal.  If you pitched this to a studio exec today --telling him it is a musical based on the Continental Congress' debate over independence in the summer of 1776, that some of the songs are duets in which John Adams in Philadelphia sings, by mental telepathy, with Abigail Adams in Massachussetts, the movie is two hours and 45 minutes long, it isn't for kids since it has alot of adult humor and a fair amount of profanity-- he'd probably have a good laugh and ask you what you really came to pitch.  Of course, it helps to know that this was a successful broadway musical before it was made into a movie, and hollywood was still making musicals in the later 1960s and the very early 1970s.Despite the extreme oddness of this movie, I really enjoyed it.  William Daniels (who is best known as Dustin Hoffman's father in the Graduate and for his role as a physician on the TV series &quot;St. Elsewhere&quot;) stars as John Adams.  Adams is very outspoken in his effort to get the Continental Congress to declare independence.  His ally in this fight is Benjamin Franklin, played superbly by Howard da Silva.  Later they recruit Thomas Jefferson (played by Ken Howard, most famous for the TV series &quot;White Shadow&quot;) to the cause of independence.  When Jefferson has writer's block while trying to write the declaration, Adams arranges for Martha Jefferson to be brought up from Virginia to inspire him.  After that, Abigail Adams asks John (by mental telepathy, of course) why John didn't bring her down for a visit.Not all of this is historically accurate.  To give an example, the size of the congressional delegations has been cut down for drama's sake; the delegation from Pennsylvania was seven, not three, and John Dickinson was not the only influential voice from Pennsylvania opposed to independence.  But the basic gist of the story is historically accurate.  The part where Thomas McKean rides down to pick up a very ill Ceasar Rodney and bring him back to congress so that the two of them can outvote fellow delegate George Read and carry Delaware for declaring independence, is a true story.  I have to admit that this movie taught me more about the fight for the declaration of independence than I ever knew before.Despite the fact that some of the songs are dated in style and a bit tedious, this was a very entertaining two hours and forty-five minutes.  It is a good example of how the DVD format helps us find and enjoy gems from the past we would otherwise never have known about.",N/A

Well, THE fun movie that doesn't contain little monsters, goonies, or Tom Hanks. As we follow the quartet through Chicago, we are introduced to hilarious scenes and crazy antics as they get themselves in the middle of a car heist, a cheating wife and her enraged husband, and many more. I must say that one of the biggest highlights of the film is the Blues Bar scene where Elisabeth Shue and the kids absolutely have to sing before leaving the bar. It's great.The films is full of great characters. Elisabeth Shue is vibrant as Chris Parker, the babysitter gal. Her interaction with the kids was great, and she handled her leading status with ease. Maia Brewton is little Sarah who offers a lot of the laughs in the movie. She was awesome - I wonder where she is now? Keith Coogan and Anthony Rapp (Rent! Mark in Rent! I love Rent!) are Brad and Daryl, and both stay true to their roles and make them entertaining. But did anyone else want to occasionally strangle Anthony Rapp for that laugh?! We also see the likes of a young Penelope Anne Miller and Vincent D'Onofrio in cameo roles. Although Miller's role is a bit bigger, and very hilarious.Although the DVD release is bare, without even a nice trailer to suit a fan, we do get a nicely widescreen anamorphic presentation with nice picture (Although there are signs of an aged film) and good audio.Adventures In Babysitting is definitely one of my favorite 80s movies.

My friend has a copy and I have watched it many times with him, as well as seeing it beforehand on television.This is in my opinion the best comedy ever made and Peter Sellers as well as being my favourite comedienne is a genius when it comes to comedy.It's such a shame he is dead because a few more Pink Panther movies made with him in it couldn't go astray.Forget the original this is the best Pink Panther movie of them all.",N/A
696862,"For all its production values and sweep this version of THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO remains insipid. The characters are thumbnail sketches, which lack all the depth necessary to convey the true meaning of this story. There is no sense of revenge, lost love or even enlightenment of revealed secrets. Instead of really feeling sympathy for the wronged Edmund Dantes you may actually feel disdain for his naivete. Richard Harris brings some life and period humor as Dantes' mentor and prison mate. This portion of the film is very good being well developed and structured. However, when Dantes escapes and returns as the Count it seems like the rest of the film got compressed to fit it into a pre-determined time slot.",N/A
667683,"...I considered Chapter 5 to be very important. This is the kind of movie that has to be viewed in its entirety, from beginning to end without interruption. I am not especially fund of dark stories, of sadomasochism. You may want to hold on to something that would make you feel secure and safe while viewing this movie. In a world of dysfunction, the main character, Isabelle Huppert, who plays Erika Kohut is among the top. She is a forty year-old piano professor at the Vienna Conservatory (incidentally she thinks that none of her pupils are good enough). She lives with her mother who worries about her daughter but in actuality is unable to face the fact that her daughter is an adult. Their co-dependency would make you sad. They sleep on the same bed and they even have fistfights! This dysfunctional relationship makes Erika among other things a voyeur. Erika meets a young man, whom she uses to act on her secret desires. He is sympathetically played by Benoit Magimel. Somewhere along the movie you wish she would listen to this man, but this is not a love story although a lot of `I love you' statements are uttered. Even the boyfriend thinks she is sick. It was petrifying to watch a scene where Erika performs an act of self-mutilation. The film never shows the details but the effect is tremendous. This movie drives you on the edge of your seat. It was a relief  when it ended, although quite abruptly, so there goes another French movie that will make you think for a long time after the last frame.If you are already a fan of Isabelle Huppert, you will find this extraordinary and remarkable performance indeed worthy of a Best Actress award (2001 Cannes Film Festival). But if you cringe at the thought of a man hitting a woman but would like to get to know Isabelle Huppert, do not make this be your first movie. Watch something like Entre Nous or wait for Huit Femmes (8 femmes, also a 2001 movie). The Piano teacher is not yet rated in the US but if `Elizabeth' gets an `R', this movie easily deserves it.",La Pianiste

I was beyond pleasantly surprised, but not right away.  This is one of those movies that creeps up on you.  I thought, about a half hour in, 'This is an ok little film.'  By the end of the movie, I had fallen totally in love with it.It is a little bit of everything, and does all of it superbly.  It's a very sad love story, an intense thriller, a paranoid psychodrama, and, if reports are to be believed, a compelling true story.All characters are drawn very well by the great cast, including Richard Gere, Laura Linney, and especially Will Patton in his turn as Gordon Smallwood.  There's a quiet desperation throughout that, while it isn't necessarily pretty or fun to watch, is very real and personal, and easy to identify with.This film is dark, and depressing on many levels, but it still manages to maintain some sense of hope.  The climax will leave you shuddering if this film has done its job, which it certainly did with me.",N/A

135537,"Unfortunately for this excellently written, exquisitly photographed, tightly directed and expertly acted semi-masterpiece, the splashy, higher profile Braveheart came out the same year. Granted Braveheart does indeed contain more spectacle and epic scale action scenes in its first half hour than Rob Roy does in its entire running time. Granted too, Mel Gibson pulled off a great feat directing and acting in such a sprawling film. However, Rob Roy may very well be the far superior film deserving of finding a loving audience.Firstly, screenwriter Alan Sharp and Director Micheal Caton-Jones work to create a virtuous hero in Rob Roy. As a character Rob loves his family, his hearth, his home and most importantly his honor. More than this, he not only espouses such high ideals, he manages to back up his words with solid deeds. His faults all plague him from the same source of his strength. His pride gets him into trouble and refreshingly, Rob Roy is a character who accepts full accountability for his failings. He is also, as we see a character who is able to listen and forgive.While it is true that Rob Roy does take its sweet time in telling its narrative, it fills its time with witty dialouge that reveals well rounded characters who fill three dimensions. The action scenes while sparse in number, are expertly filled with suspense and true tension. This is due directly to Sharp and Caton-Jones letting their actors tell their story so we truly care about their futures.It is truly rare in this day and age to find a hero who obeys the sancity of marriage and well as truly honor his word and be willing to lead from the front. Rob, in the classic tradition of of Beowulf, sets his objectives and no matter what the obstacle, follows through.Every shot, cut and line works in carefull polished precise unity to create the hero as work of art.The film is explicit in its depiction of sexual relations. But for once, a story shows congress between a husband and wife who are passionate for one another as well as utterly devoted. More on the chemistry between Jessica Lange and Liam Neeson later. This tender and poetic intimacy is starkly contrasted with the violent rape scene and casual philanderings of Tim Roth's Archie Cunningham. It is so rare that explicit sex actually serves as an enhancer of plot and character and not simple audience titilation.The photography of Karl Walter Lindenlaub gloriously captures the harsch beauty and craggy green peaks of the Scottish highlands. The sense of geographical location as a character works overtime in Rob Roy. Only in such a colorful and violent landscape could a hero like Rob exist. The Scottish Tourism board must still be on their knees thanking the producers for the film.The film's casting is nothing short of perfect. Lang and Neeson generate sheer sparks in their scenes together. The quite moments they share with their eyes is all what film acting aspires. Hollywood must couple these two expert actors again. Neeson combines raw sexuality with expert acting craftsmanship. Rob Roy may be the one film that utilized Neeson's rare talents to the upmost. Neeson is that rarest of rare commodities: a movie star. His Rob Roy is really a stunning example of subtle emotional complexity combined with sheer animal athleticism.The rest of the cast is sublime. The scene where Jessica Lange proudly and defiantly marches out of a burning house, holding her head high, with tears of shame brimming against her eyes is a true Oscar moment if there ever was one.John Hurt, Andrew Keir, Brian Cox and the rest of the cast turn in fully inhabited performances as well. However, special mention must be made of Tim Roth's foppish and gentile Satan Archie Cunningham. Not only is he evil and deserving of a violent end, he also manages to elicit sympathy and reveal his true humanity laying underneath his sneer.Rob Roy is a film of complexity and beauty. It is a film of refined violence and consistent excellence. It is a story of good versus evil in color. It is a classic in need of a larger following.",N/A
331085,"I enjoyed this movie, even though it does take some cheap shots at the musclemen and the health & fitness movement.Jane Powell and Debbie Reynolds are delightful in their roles and their voices are at their peak. You will love hearing them sing.Edmund Purdom and Vic Damone add some worldly class to this film. Reeves definitely has presence here and it's easy to see why he became a star many years later. It was this movie that landed him the role of Hercules.At one point in the movie, Edmund Purdom lites up a cigerette and Reeves pulls the cigarette out of his mouth and says; ""What are you trying to do, suffocate us?"" In real life, Reeves was opposed to smoking.The movie also has a Mr. Universe contest which Reeves wins after successfully completing a continental clean and press of 400 lbs to break a deadlock with Lynn Lyman.Interesting because in real life back in 1948 Reeves was tied for first place with former weightlifter John Grimek in the Mr. Universe contest in London, England. Grimeks athletic prowess broke the tie and gave him the win, even though Reeves had the best physique.Athena is a good movie. It's a funny, clean movie.

42243,"Attenborough's gentle film, based on the stage play of the same name, in turn based on the events of Lewis' relationship with (and later, marriage to) Joy Gresham, is a thought-provoking drama that deals with questions that will have faced every person of faith at one time or another. The themes of human experience, the, at times puzzling, antithesis of pain and happiness, and what it means to be authentically human, are lucidly developed without being overdone or becoming cliched.This was the first time in a while I have cried watching a film. In fact, the tears really flowed as I watched the anguish of Anthony Hopkin's brilliant performance. Part of that was the confrontation with the heartache and pain inherent in human existence (at least on this side of eternity); part of it was seeing in Lewis' struggle with the question of pain a reflection of the inner struggle that we all face as we try to hold on to faith in God at times when life seems to be doing all it can to confuse us. With that in mind, this is no sentimental love story: this is a painful, though at the same time inspiring, journey into the paradoxes and dilemmas of faith and life that we are all familiar with.",N/A

666841,"Teensploitation movies are one of my not-so-private shames. A guilty pleasure that I've had, probably since the first time I saw the ""Breakfast Club."" Maybe even going back as far as ""Gidget."" But even I have to admit that sometimes they can get somewhat repetitive and monotonous.""100 Girls"" was quiet refreshing. Not only was it different than the end-of-highschool-one-last-party-take-the-ugly-girl-who's-actually-a-knockout-to-the-prom stories that we have become accustomed to (not that there's anything wrong with that formula), its also an easy to relate to romantic comedy for twenty somethings who aren't as much a fan of that genre. II'm long past being a college freshman, but even a decade later, I coulc look back and see myself being that guy.Michael Davis of ""Eight Days a Week"" brings us this refreshing college, romantic comdey about a boy in search of his dream girl and the story of how becomes a man on the way.

241410,"I must've been 6 when this came out.  It's one of those things you remember adults talking about.  Actually it's funny, until I watched this DVD, I'd only seen the chopped-up TV version of the film, and I don't think I'd ever laid eyes on the (evidently) notorious kitchen sink scene at all.  I bet there's still a VHS tape in my parent's basement with the lame G-rated ""Fatal Attraction"" on it complete with vintage commercials.Well here you get the whole thing complete with F-words and nipples and no commercials, plus the fabled original ending.  This, by the way, is impossibly anticlimactic in comparison with the ending they ended up with, and it's easy to see why test audiences found it unsatisfying in the first place.  The ""Madame Butterfly"" scene with Glenn Close is dramatic and gruesome, but in a sombre, distant, emotionally detached way - and the way that Michael Douglas and family hear about what happened, you feel like you must've dozed off and missed something.  (I'm trying to be cryptic so as not to give it away totally.)  The ending we all knew and loved is way more Hollywood balls-out teeth-bared eyes-popping insane, so if you were expecting another scenario with that kind of energy, forget it.  But Close apparently fought hard for the original ending, probably because it's such an iconographic, immortalizing shot, Whistler-picturesque yet Goya-gory.So, the film itself.  It's funny how movies from 15 or 20 years ago seem sort of transparent and obvious cuz you've seen the same stuff rehashed the same way so many times.  We get the set-up of Douglas as an enviable example of ""everyman"" with his perfect American-dream homelife, his little girl with the haircut like a boy, his perpetually bleary-eyed, stuffy-nosed soccer mom of a wife (Anne Archer in typical form).  He's a lawyer earning a comfortable living and essentially has no reason to mess around.So of course he does.  Classic Noir.  He meets Close - who certainly does look fatal with that ludicrous blond electric-socket afro - at a business party, then later at work.  Then wifey goes out of town with the kid for a weekend; Close closes in; and next thing you know they're doing the dirty dishes.  Then they go down in the elevator.  Then...etc.  By the end of the weekend Douglas is coming to his senses after repeated head-shrinkings, and starts to pull away from Close.But she won't be ignored.The performances are theatrical and over-the-top across the board.  It looks like everybody was trying to scream and flail their way to an Oscar.  People were worried about whether Close could play ""sexy"" - I think this was a couple years before ""Dangerous Liasons"" - and while she's not exactly my cup of tea, she's convincing in her charisma with Douglas.  For his part, the great son of Kirk just does his shtick, which is playing the neo-noir hero who lets his lust carry him away.  Anne Archer, see above, bleary-eyed stuffy-nosed soccer mom.  Add em all together and you have a decent movie, certainly pretty entertaining even if laughable in parts.  And the special features on the DVD ought to answer all your trivia questions.",N/A
214164,"The Star Trek movie series with the ""classic"" crew (Kirk, Spock, McCoy, etc.) peaked in this film, the third in the unofficial three-part ""Death of Spock"" saga.

The clash of present and future is nothing short of brilliant, including comedic scenes that fit perfectly into the film and are not overdone.

29636,"Although I didn't find the first `Austin Powers' to be laugh-out-loud funny for the most part, it was fun to watch. It has that so-dumb-it's-funny vibe to it.

I've practically memorized his monologue about his childhood in the father-son encounter group scene word-for-word (pretty sad, huh?)! Fortunately, the guys who put this flick together saw the bad Doctor's potential, and had him stealing the show in the follow-up `The Spy Who Shagged Me'!Anyway, enough babbling about the movie, time for me to go over the DVD features. The sound & picture was really good, among the best quality I've seen out of all of New Line's Platinum Series video discs. The commentary track featuring co-writer/producer/star Mike Myers & director Jay Roach includes plenty of behind-the-scenes anecdotes regarding whatever scene they're viewing, as well as ideas they thought up for certain moments in the movie that were either totally changed around or scrapped completely. You know, the basic informative commentary track. Then there's an original theatrical trailer, which is practically an obligatory special feature for just about every movie DVD nowadays. Also included were a few deleted scenes, including one with future young-number-two Rob Lowe. I usually prefer that cut scenes be restored to the movie for the DVD release. But in this case, after having seen them, I feel that many of the cropped moments wouldn't have worked quite as well if they'd stayed.Most of the other special features aren't that big a deal- just a lot of Mr. Myers mugging for the camera in various screen-saver-style psychedelic vignettes. And then there's the least special feature: like Warner Bros., New Line releases their movie platters in cardboard snap sleeves, rather than the more-durable plastic keep cases most other studios use nowadays. I guess the `retro' feel of the movie must've trickled down to the studio's video packaging department...`Late!",N/A

404638,"THE RIBOS OPERATION is a severely underrated classic that sometimes gets forgotten about in the Key To Time season.  The script is quite good and shows Robert Holmes at the height of his dialog-writing powers.  It doesn't get all of the credit that it deserves, and this is a pity, because almost every aspect of the production is excellent, from the script to the acting to much of the incidental music to the set design.  There is almost nothing here to distract from what is extremely fun and witty adventure.The atmosphere is superb.  The sets and, in particular, the costumes are exceptionally well done, especially when one considers the budget they were working with here.  Possibly a lot of it was taken from stock and then given superficial modifications, but this really adds to the script's medieval and Russian flavors.  It feels old-fashioned, and the few futuristic elements slide right alongside the historical pieces.  The aliens are planet-hopping aristocrats with lasers, wrist-communicators and space-drives, but they trade in gold, and are concerned with half-brothers on thrones.  The soldiers in the story more resemble knights in armor than science-fiction stormtroopers.  The modern and the tradition merge extremely well and the two parts complement are a great complement to each other.Science vs. magic/superstition is another theme that rears its head in this serial.  Unlike other stories (say, THE DAEMONS), this story puts both of those subjects on the same level.  The magic isn't just given a technobabble explanation; it actually appears to work in the confines of the story.  The Seeker makes predictions that prove correct, has second sight, and uses magical incantations, while the story gives every indication that she genuinely does possess unearthly powers.  This is vitally important for keeping the balance between science and magic.When we hear the story of Binro the Heretic, we already know that his calculations and deductions about the lights in the night sky are correct, so our sympathies will automatically go towards his point of view.  But if the Seeker had been revealed to be merely a slight-of-hand conjurer, then the battle between the two elements would have been drastically undermined.  Because the magical side is so powerful, we can see exactly why someone like Binro has been shunned and derided by his peers.  It's not just that what he says conflicts with their religious viewpoint, but also they have apparent proof that the superstitions have a concrete basis in reality.  Holmes doesn't chicken out of the conflict, but portrays it in a mature and surprisingly balanced manner.  It would be easy for Holmes to have us conclude that Binro is right, and that the Seeker is a con artist.  But he doesn't do that - we have at least some evidence that both sides of the conflict have a sound case for parts of their belief.The characters in this serial are larger than life and twice as fun.  During his career, Robert Holmes wrote a number of over-the-top, almost operatic individuals and THE RIBOS OPERATION is certainly no exception.  The actors, without exception, all latch on to how these characters need to be played and all deliver exactly the type of performance required.  The Graff Vynda-K can't be anything other than an obsessed and fanatical tyrant.  Garron has to be a great big lovable rouge.  In a story such as this, louder is better.  These are archetypes on paper, and the actors bringing them to life inject them with enough humanity and pathos to let them live.I'm not usually a fan of the actors-only commentaries on these Doctor Who DVDs.  Of those discs that have been released in the US so far, the audio tracks that contain no members of the production team are boring and useless, with the people concerned not remembering much about the story and not having known much about the behind-the-scenes planning in the first place.  But the commentary for this DVD is highly amusing despite only consisting of Tom Baker and Mary Tamm.  While it isn't the most informative thing I've ever listened to, I couldn't stop laughing.  It's an extremely entertaining track featuring a few interesting tidbits from Tamm, punctuated by occasional orgasmic sound effects courtesy of Mr. Baker.The pop-up production notes provide us with a lot of detail about the numerous cuts and edits that were made to the original Robert Holmes script.  I find this sort of thing fascinating, and it's really interesting to see how the script evolved.  Incorporating the Key arc, to tightening up the script for timing reasons are all featured here.The DVD picture and sound are quite good considering the age of the material.  This disc upholds the high standards that the Doctor Who DVDs have achieved in these areas.  The rest of the extras (Photo Gallery, Who's Who) are things that I really have no interest in, but some people like them, and it's nice to know that they're there.It's interesting to note that at the time of writing this review, Robert Holmes has become the most represented author on the Doctor Who DVDs.  And if you really have no idea why, then check out this disc for a reevaluation of a forgotten classic.  No one wrote dialog quite like Holmes, and it's absolutely amazing to see what can happen when the writer and the actors play off each other's strengths so perfectly.",Doctor Who - The Ribos Operation VHS

Having spent much of my life in the military, I had a very difficult time ignoring all the glaring flaws.  For entertainment value alone it is quite good.  The acting and action scenes are well done, however, the plot is confusing and so far off base that it drags down a great cast and crew to the level of a B movie action flick.

227692,"I originally saw this movie upon it's release. It sticks in my memory not only because I don't often go to see a film in a movie theatre, aside from ""art houses"", but because it was one of the also few times I can recall ever experiencing a collective audience reaction, of shared awe, to a film. It remains one of the scariest, intelligent, hold-onto-your-seat horror/sci-fi films of all time. There had not been, and there has not been since, a creature to instill such terror onto an audience, as the one in this movie. To this day, as then, you can only say ""How'd they do that??!!"" But, for a movie to be truly terrifying, to the point that the audience is ""involved"", well..special effects alone can't do it. The players have to convey a total believability to an unbelievable situation. In this film, they succeed completely in scaring the living [daylights] out of you. Sigourney Weaver is incredible as Ripley, in this sequel which is far superior to any in the series. Her ""Rambo"" like, but still feminine turn in this role was as unique then, as now, for female roles, and is totally convincing. The supporting cast are all equally believable, Paul Reiser especially so as the definitive corporate slime-ball. Aside from Weavers ""Ripley"", I found the character of Vasquez, the super-butch she-commando who out-testosterones the men and monsters, to be one of the most memorable characters in this film, or any of it's kind, and her performance gives Weaver a run for her money. This film is just a non-stop, roller coaster ride of un-relenting terror. The unique, eerie music scored for this film only increases the sense of foreboding which never let's up. There are many memorable scenes, the climactic to- the- death battle between Ripley and the ""Queen"" alien, as Ripley defends the life of the orphaned little girl, being one of the most memorable, and, for my vote, the most awe-inspiring in motion picture history. This is a film that will impress even non- sci-fi/horror fans, with its' intelligence, story, and, oft-imitated but never even closely duplicated effects. All together, they make one of the most memorable movie experiences, that transcends its' ""genre"", and is ,simply , one of the best movies of the last 20 years.

512080,"This movie is when actors did not talk, they just acted out their emotions, sometimes to the point where you could just laugh out loud. The neat thing about the film is that Max Shrek, really really really looks like a vampire. He doesn't come across as so much scary, almost resigned to have to live like an animal, but really creepy. The movie follows the same plot as Bram Stoker's Dracula. It is easy to follow and is entertaining. I guess the main thing about the film is that Murreu used alot of different camera shots that had not been used before, like having several different scenarios going at one time. This is now just normal but back than it was really fabulous and made hem famous. Another neat thing is that I watched &quot;Shadow of the Vampire&quot; first than watched the original, Nosferatu. It was fun to compare the two and think about the director as I watched the original. It was also fun to remember Greta in The Shadow and to to see her in this film. Also it helps to either have read Bram Stoker's Dracula or watched it. There is a good one with Winona Ryder and Keanu Reeves. I liked it, it was directed by Francis Ford Coppola.

471076,"One can't help but enjoy this IMPRESSIVE video collection on DVD - ok, ok, I LOVE it - because that's the power of this mix of hits and tunes from (only?) 7 years of a great career - BUT a true fan can't help feeling TOTALLY CHEATED out of some of the most valuable gems of Mrs. Guy Ritchie's video history!!! And while I'm at it, why just 7 years? It seems ridiculously apparent that the ""suits"" at Warner/Maverick/AOL Time Warner, etc., etc., have sliced this package up for ""optimum selling power"" as a ""family friendly"" product. And the fact that the fans reviewing this DVD have largely accepted these omissions is strange. The obvious and glaring omissions of ""Erotica"", ""Justify my Love"" and ""Deeper & Deeper"" (no matter when they were released) is an utter act of cowardace on the part of the company to support/back the superior Mrs. Ritchie - and could she have made them any $$richer??  Truly a disgusting error!  Again, while I love this digital collection, and view/listen OFTEN, I continue to be GREATLY disappointed that the fans weren't treated to the total package.  Mrs. Ritchie is obviously not done creatively (the Drowned World Tour was her best yet), but a retrospective of videos to date is absolutely necessary! Enough with the ""teaser"" packages!! Other important omissions: ""This Used To be My Playground"", ""You'll See"", I'll Remember"", and lastly, but NOT LEAST - the haunting ""I Want You"" featuring Massive Attack (I just can't understand this error!).  Additionally, while I'm still ranting, (with the hope that someone at MAVERICK is listening - hello Mrs. Ritchie, are you out there?), it is also important to mention the other videos left out of the first (or second) collection - the always  fantastic, ""Burning Up""; ""Everybody""; (a live and classic) ""Dress You Up""; ""Crazy For You"" and ""Gambler"" from Vision Quest; ""Into The Groove""; ""Live To Tell""; ""True Blue""; ""Who's That Girl""; ""Causing A Commotion""; and ""Dear Jesse"".  The company's CHEAP approach at slapping together 2 DVDs with SO MANY missing classic performances really is worthy of attention, but as long as the fans continue to applaud this type of butchery, nothing will change!  Power in numbers... start the letter writing campaign to Warner/Maverick and AOL Time Warner and cross your fingers!  Oh! Were you looking for a review of the DVD?? Well then, what are you waiting for Madonna fans? Go ahead and buy it already!",N/A

189176,"Ever since Bela Lugosi began the zombie genre back in the 30s, Hollywood thought of the idea that the dead might walk the earth solely in terms of gothic and serious horror.  The zombies of that era were usually centered in Haiti and were under the mind control of a demented shaman.  It did not occur to anyone that zombies might have a gentler, even humorous side.  Certainly, when George Romero brought out his LIVING DEAD trilogy, the notion that the walking dead must be the height of seriousness was etched in stone.  Yet, in the 80s with the EVIL DEAD series of director Sam Raimi, Hollywood saw an opportunity to inject some much needed life into a moribund genre.  Now, by 2000, director David Parker continues this tremendously amusing, albeit gory, trend with THE DEAD HATE THE LIVING.  The plot can be seen as a humorous version of the 'young kids get their comeuppance' so popular in slasher movies of the 80s.  Other,less understanding critics simply label this film and others of its ilk as unabashed ripoffs of earlier, better known walking dead movies.  The truth is that both approaches have merit.TDHTL is a funny satire on the making of walking dead movies, exactly like this one.  Director Parker uses unknown youthful actors who play actors in a zombie film.  Thus, as in HAMLET, you have a movie-within-a-movie.  But unlike HAMLET, the events of TDHTL present the inner movie as far more interesting than the outer.  A nearly financially broke and probably bereft of talent group of teens are shooting a walking dead movie in a spooky house that is actually a conduit to another dimension from which its walking dead now find ready passage to the world of our dimension.  One of the more subtle ironies is that it takes some real talent to portray actors of no talent.  Eric Clawson and Matt Stephens are convincingly and humorously horrified as the leads. What Director Parker presents is yet another variation on the consequences of attempting to Go Where Man Is Not Supposed to Go.  The results are gory, spectacular, and quite unnerving.  The difference between TDHTL and its more serious ancestors--say ZOMBIE--is that the viewer has nearly as much fun watching the ketchup fly as do the actors tossing that same ketchup around.  The fun is contagious, and this I suggest is what an entertaining movie is supposed to do.",N/A
597570,"DIE ANOTHER DAY was in a word terrific.  While it probably won't win any oscars or awards, on a level of movies that this one rests on, it is terrific.Bond movies were begining to be a little stagnant.  Not that all of the Bond movies don't follow the same formula...there was not one scene that I couldn't see coming in THE WORLD IS NOT ENOUGH and hardly one line that I found remotely funny, and was thus very bored.  THANKFULLY, for all of us Bond fans, DIE ANOTHER DAY succeeds brilliantly in injecting some surprise, great action, and even some new directing back into the francise.  It's also good to see that the sprawling 60's style production of big futuristic sets have returned to the series not to mention Bond's newest rolling arsenal of destruction, the Aston Martin Vanquish is here to give those Beemer's the boot.DIE ANOTHER DAY's story has Bond getting into North Korea to assassinate a General, while he succeeds he is shortly captured and subjected to torture!  For the next 14 months!!  Released via prisoner exchange, M tells Bond that she has lost her faith in him and leaves him to rot in a Hospital while he is rehabilitating.  Bond breaks free and goes from Cuba learning of a DNA experiment on the prisoner who he was excahnged for, and following a clue going to Iceland to see a billionaire demonstrate his new satelite, which secretly could be used for mass destruction via solar rays.  Are the two men connected?  Bond thinks so (so yes of course they are) and while working (or when they bump into each other) with a woman named Jinx who may or may not have her own agenda, the two must work to stop the mad pair.Not to sound trite, but I was glued to the screen.  There was hardly a moment that I didn't like save for two occasions.  Ice queen Miranda Frost (a contender for worst Bond girl with Britt Ekland in the annoying dept,) Is 100% pouty and has NO life, an allusion to her name being Frost maybe. The second is Maddona's theme song.  I actually kinda like some of Maddona's more recent work, but this one was poppy and obnoxious.  (Look for Maddona in the movie as a fencing coach.)The humor, well this could also be the funniest Bond movie.  John Cleese is the only person imaginable to replace Q and he gets away with most of the best lines.  The double entandres are as abundant as ever and you actually don't groan at all of them.  Miss Moneypenny's little stunt near the end of the movie, is a near laugh riot.Over the top in a few places, yes but I didn't care at all.  DIE ANOTHER DAY is excellant and ranks right up near the top for favorite Bond film.  (After THE SPY WHO LOVED ME and FROM RUSSIA WITH LOVE.) Bond fan?  Your assignment....GET TO THE DAMN THEATER!! and when it comes out on DVD..... PICK IT UP!!",Die Another Day
36894,"This is a very funny, very sweet, and quite smart little comedy.  I'd call it a screwball comedy for the new millenium.  Christian Campbell and JP Pitoc are great together, and the supporting actors are all a scream.  Another plus for me is the setting, NYC's West Village.  In fact, one scene always moves me, since it it set in a favorite piano bar that no longer exists, Eighty-Eights.  Watch for it as Christian's friend sings the heartwarming &quot;Como Te Gusta Mi Pinga&quot;...which gives you an idea about how broad the comedy is played at times.

576328,"It seems, from reading the reviews that are written about this film, that people either absolutely loved it or out right hated it. I actually found myself in between while watching this film for the first time yesterday. After reading some of the reviews here, I was browsing through my local dvd store and picked it up on a whim. Here's what I thought:The plot of the movie couldn't be more simple. A gang of hoodlums break into a family's house while they are home. They begin to terrorize the family while the two daughters (who the thugs didn't know existed yet) try to escape and get help. That's it. There's no backstory on any of the characters and the movie gets under way without and development at all. Most of the violence in the film is done off screen so we really don't get to see much of it, just hear it. And since there are no special effects, no set changes and pretty much no budget, what we are left with is the story, the characters and the acting.I felt the real winner in this little film was the acting. The girl who layed Loribeth was actually quite good. Coming off as very scared but determined. The main ""bad guy"" (done in meniacal fashion by the same ""bad guy"" in ""I Know What You Did Last Summer"") also was very convincing as the instigator/leader of the group. Most of the supporting cast was acceptable enough.Overall, the movie successfully comes off with a bit of a scared and tense feeling to it and does the job of making you interested and feel sympathy for Loribeth. I felt with a little more effort and maybe a few more bucks in the budget they could have made it into something much better, but it's a reasonable entry into a genre that doesn't get much attention nowadays....",N/A

I happen to have some karate experience (a green belt in Tae Kwon Do, in fact) so I know enough to say that for a bunch of grown ups to be good at karate, it's insulting to those men to get beat up by ninja students half their size. Thus, they even had ninja swords. To see three little shrimps like that kick ... definetly insults me...Although it was suppose to be a comedy and yes, even I thought it was funny at times, but to twist common sense around like what this movie did about fighting, I just have to say it's the worst movie I ever saw.....",N/A

268651,"A perfectly realized western, retelling the classic story of the shootout at the OK Corral... Henry Fonda first appears onscreen as a grizzled, shaggy cattleman, soon revealed to be the legendary lawman, Wyatt Earp.  Walter Brennan excels as the heartless patriarch of the Clanton family, whose sons draw Earp into an unavoidable blood feud.  Brennan's performance, like Fonda's, is magnificently understated, as is pretty much everything else about this film -- director John Ford embues every scene with an economy of presentation that takes the western genre into the level of high art.  Everything about this film rings true... well, other than the romantic melodrama surrounding 'Doc' Holliday, and Victor Mature's mannered portrayal of the tubercular gunman... with fronteir life evoked with the same richness of detail that Ford later recreated in ""The Man Who Shot Liberty Valence.""  Here, though, the choke of dry dust and sense of fast danger are much more present.  The Clantons are a much more sinister set of badmen than Lee Marvin's exaggerated schoolyard bullies; Brennan and his boys simply sidle up and ooze menace and dark violence.  The B&W cinematography is typically gorgeous, and Ford never misses a beat in his calm, patient direction.  Highly recommended.",N/A

I walked out of the theater saying, &quot;Ehh, it was OK.&quot;I decided to pick up the 2 disc edition of JACKIE BROWN just to complete my Tarantino DVD collection, and I must say that this film was a joy to rediscover. It's still no PULP FICTION, but now I realize it was never meant to be PF. Tarantino says so himslef on the disc that it wasn't even really made for the same audience as PF! I enjoyed catching little gems in the film that I never noticed the first time around such as the brilliant subtlety of Robert DeNiros's hilarious performance.Absent from the DVDs plethora of extras is a Tarantino commentary, but we get something just as good: an hour long 1-on-1 interview in which Tarantino not only discusses the film, but the whole atmosphere surrounding the film during it's release, his hopes and dissapointments the film's release brought, and why this project was such a labour of love for him.So leave your jive expectations of PULP at the door,sucka, and get ready to just enjoy a good movie with outta sight characters and a funky groove that just won't quit.

18903,"This movie introduces no new material to Monty Python's body of work.  It selects several key routines from the first two series of Monty Python's Flying Circus and reshoots them.  So why bother?Because this is easier to watch.This film was shot as part of an abortive attempt to introduce Monty Python to an American audience (which wouldn't actually be accopmlished for another three years).  Where the original series suffered from a low budget and spotty production values, this film has high-end production quality, including clean sound, a single variable-angle 35mm camera, and the exclusion of the laugh track that muddied the sound on the TV series.  There was obviously money for retakes, allowing the boys to edit out minor line muffs and giving them permission to experiment with their character delivery.The picture is clear and organic.  The sound is clean and audible.  The characters are fun and believable.  Just what we've always loved about Monty Python, isn't it?But be warned, except for one or two linking jokes, this is material that you've already seen.

704013,"Poor ABC.  They havent been doing too well latley.  In an effort to save themselfes, they made a TV movie called Dinotopia.  Sadley, this movie and the series that is following it, have failed mysrembly.  Way back, about 4 years ago, when I heard that ABC was doing a adaption of Dinotopia, I was very excited, being a gargantuan fan of books.  I was very excited when they started the movie on ABC.  When it was over, I simply sat stunned, amazed at how BAD the adaption of one of my favorite book series was.  Ok, its more like a semi-adaption, because the movie takes place in the modern era.  One day, a father and his 2 sons take of in a small airplane.  The father decides to take a nap and let his sons fly the plane.  4 hours later,They stupidly fly into a hurricane and unsiprisingly, they crash, and, you gussed it, the dad perishes.  From that point on, the movies flaws hatch out of thier shells and start running amuck.  For one thing, what father would let his sons pilot a plane?  How could the 2 kids survive in a hurricane with no raft, no life jackets, no flares etc.  for over 5 hours?After landing on the island, they meet a suspicoious man who befriends them and takes them to some poorly constructed sets, I mean village.  There they encounter a terrifying poorly made CGI dinosaur that is subdued by a lady (A very attractive lady of course) and then they head for waterfall city.  From that point on, they try to adapt to life in a dino island while trying to survive being complete idiots.  They love to swear (Nothing big, this being a ABC film), love to hate each other, and are completly obsessed with getting away.  So much in fact that one of them takes a stone that powers a villiage in exchange for a rowboat to sail home with, a useless map, and no provisions.  And on top of that, he has to sail across a deadly reef, find a path home with no compass, and dont forget that he flew for over 4 hours before crashing and that he had to stay afloat for over 5 hours.  And there is a hurricane on the horizon.  You really wonder how these people managed to get through grade school.  These errors are everywhere.  The mayor of Waterfall city is a complete arrogant stuborn idiot who refuses to evacuate anybody when killer birds are heading straight for the city, even though they have a few hours to evacuate. (In the series, how come they can evacuate everybody in a few hours while they cant in the movie?)My favorite part of the movie is how dumb some of the moments can be later on in the movie, along with some continuity errors.The World Beneath, which is breathtaking in the books, meerly consists of 1 or 2 tunnels used over and over agian, and a tiny crystal cavern.  In these tunnels our heroes encounter one of the least suprising plot twists in T.V. movie history.  (How did he get there?)  The continuity errors are hysterical.  At one point, a skybak instructor tells the students that if thier bird dosent show up, they can never be skybak riders.  Of course, our heroes bird dosent show up and he fails, yet when he tries again, he passes and the instructor does nothing.  When a charachter is attacked by another charachter, tossed in a sack and tossed into a river to die, he shows up, unharmed and none the worse for wear a few scenes later with no explenation as to how he got there.  Huh?The biggest flaw in the entire film has got to be the final battle, where Evil Pteridactals attack waterfall city.  That sounds Ok, but in execution, the scene is unintentionally hilarious.  When the birds attack, all the citizens run around screaming, yet nobody thinks about running inside a building.  Our heroes arrive just in time, and in a atrociously poorly animated sequence, they manage to help save the city.  And come on, Pteridactals are really LAME villians.  Why not a Tyranosaur?  (They only show up once for about a minute early on)  There is however, one bright spot.  Zippo the librarian is a funny, interesting charachtewr that is the best actor in the entire film.  The list just goes on and on, and I'm out of room, so in closing, no matter how you cut it, Dinotopia is a Brachiasour sized disaster.The good:ZippoSome unintentially funny scenesyou can have fun counting out all the bad elements in the filmThe bad:noneThe ugly:atrocious actingbad scriptlousy CGI effectsbad setslots of continuity errorsSummary:Only good for those who have never read the books.

551868,"""Extreme Evolution"" is ECW's debut ""best of"" collection for fans who have and have not been aware of its insane hardcore weaponry combined with skillful scientific wrestling. But this VHS only features two matches that are deemed great, whilst the others are passable or forgettable.1.) Jerry Lynn vs. Rob Van Dam- Plenty of fans call this TV Title match the greatest of its kind, but everyone is speaking hyperbole here. Sure, we're seeing two expert high-flyers using chairs and tables on each other for over 20 minutes, and many of the spots are fantastic. (Most entertaining scenes involve the Van Daminator, a finisher that has a chair kicked right on the foe's face. RVD does 2 of his classic Van Daminators, and Lynn even does a drop-kick Van Daminator of his own!) But what sorely hurts this match is the huge lag time between spots and several constant mistakes on the part of RVD. (When Lynn crashes onto the floor, RVD desperately tugs him, and then lets him go, not sure what to do next.) So some people say it's classic, but I'll have to say it's just good. ****2.) Mike Awesome vs. Masato Tanaka- This one's the REAL classic! I've followed Awesome and Tanaka's feud for some time, and everything they've done to each other is insanity and brutality coupled together. This is without a doubt the greatest ECW Heavyweight Title match ever made in the 7 years of video it has captured. It's unbelievable how many chairs die in this matchup, not to mention the two explosive table spots with each spot done by one man or the other! Awesome especially threw everything he ever knew with numerous Awesome Bombs, leaping dives over the ropes, and as you'd expect, a mean chain of smacks with a chair. He even counters Tanaka's infamous Tornado DDT, landing the challenger down two lying chairs! This match would've been my ultimate favorite of all time, but the announcing work is uninspiring and the camera work can get distracting, which is why my favorite Awesome/Tanaka match is from ""Heat Wave 1998"". Still, you'd be a total idiot if you missed this one out! *****++2/3The next matches will be given brief synopses...3.) Sandman vs. Raven- Brutal, disgusting barb wire match with a cane and several tables in use. The spots are fine and sick, but the ending is very weak... ***4.) The Eliminators vs. Steve Williams and Bam Bam Gordy- Hardly any of the fighting here is memorable, but Perry Saturn's 20-foot elbow drop off a scaffold deserved its classic feel. * for match, **** for Saturn's elbow.5.) Tommy Dreamer & Beulah vs. Shane Douglas & Francine- Passable way to end the tape, as Dreamer and Douglas brawl while their respective girlfriends make a catfight. Highlights here include an out of the ring riot and Dreamer's piledriver to Francine. As you'd expect, a T & A fest. ***Rent ""Extreme Evolution"" and you'll be happy.

584079,"Typical John Woo film. Minimum story; maximum blood.As in Face Off, Woo sets up personal conflicts, moral abiguities, conflicts of duty, friendship, loyalty and emotion. Then develops none of them.This could have been a masterpiece on par with Private Ryan or Thin Red Line, but ended up being a WWII version of 3000 Miles to Graceland.Yes war is about senseless violence and death, but this movie was billed as being a story about the Navaho Code Talkers.I was hoping for a film that was actually about the Navaho Code-talkers. Unfortunately this was not it. Yes it did feature a code-talker or two here and there but it was more about explosions, blood and flying bodies. Not as some reviewers claim war violence but the worst of Hollywood's stylized over choreographed nonsense.Woo kept forgetting that the mnovie was supposedly about the Code talkers, then would suddenly remember and throw in a few seconds of a Navaho yelling into a radio, then back to the gore and explosions.The explosions were not even realistic. I am sorry, but hand grenades do not produce 10 foot fireballs, Thompsons do not fire at 1800 rounds per minutes and .30 carbines do not throw their victims back through the air when the round hits.As in ""Face Off"", John Woo took an intriguing psychological concept, dropped the concept in midstream filled the rest in with unrealistic and excessive violence.I found this movie very tiresome and had I seen it in the theatre I would have most likely have walked out midway through the picture. With the DVD it took me 4 sittings to finally bull my way through it.If you want a proper war movie get or see ""We Were Soldiers""Don't waste your money on this mess of a nonsensical movie.",N/A
538636,"While we may be hesitant to admit it, America has a fondness for scoundrels. Maybe it's our nation's way of fighting its Puritan origins. Perhaps it's because we love freedom in all its many forms. The movies have always given us with characters who delight in bending the rules. From Mae West and W. C. Fields to The Godfather and Indiana Jones, we have laughed or cried, as the case may be, at their antics. The mother-daughter con team in the comedy Heartbreakers is Hollywood's latest devilish duo. This movie isn't destined to be a classic. It's too long, and it's not as clever as it should have been. Still, it provides an adequate number of laughs. Despite its limitations, it stands head and shoulder about this year's other comedies, most of which have had about as much class as a toilet bowl.The opening shots are of the gorgeous wedding of Max and Dean [Sigourney Weaver and Ray Liotta]. Dean is completely smitten by Max and is clueless as to the problems that are about to develop. She is using an alias. He doesn't even know her real name is Max. He'd certainly be surprised to know this is her thirteenth trip down the aisle. No wonder she's so good at it. Poor Dean! The best is yet to come. His sexy new secretary, who is about to seduce him, is not only Max's partner, she's also her daughter, Page [Jennifer Love Hewitt]. Soon the ladies will be off to Palm Beach, taking with them all of Dean's heart and half of his fortune. Who will the ladies try to catch in Florida's playground of the rich? And what of Dean? Have they heard the last of him?Weaver and Liotta make a welcome return to comedy, a medium they both excel at. Liotta is one of the few actors who can be funny and menacing at the same time. Also aboard is Gene Hackman, who plays Max's next victim, an obnoxious, chain-smoking tobacco heir named William Tensy. He appears to be having as much fun playing the part as we do watching him play it. Anne Bancroft has a small but delightful part as Barbara, the woman who taught Max everything. Jason Lee is fine as Jack, the guy Page accidentally falls in love with. Hewitt is the weak link in the cast. She plays Page as a woman totally devoid of charm, which makes Jack's falling for her a bit of a stretch.This is a really lovely movie to look at. The color in the photography is vibrant and crisp. The location shots and the sets are dazzling. And those dresses! I rarely even notice dresses, but the ones designed for Weaver and Hewitt are knockouts. They remind us that a movie can say much about a character just by the way he or she is dressed.",N/A

712873,"I'm frequently impressed at how well French filmmakers capture the tumultuous emotions of adolescence. While most American films try for ""popcorn pulp"" treatments of teenage life - light, cliched situations played out by kids who seem to have been cast for how well they'd grace the cover of Seventeen or YM Magazines rather than for any acting talent - Girls Can't Swim (or Les Filles Ne Savent Pas Nager, as the French call it) offers serious explorations of the minds and passions of its two fifteen-year-old protagonists, played with intense passion and sincerity by its stars. The basic premise is nothing new: Gwen and Lise have grown up best of friends, and Lise and her family spend every summer vacation at the beach town where Gwen lives. But this summer, Gwen is less inclined to spend time with Lise as she is with the local boys, who are eager to take advantage in her newfound interest in sex. Lise, whose estranged father has recently died, begins replacing Gwen as favorite in the eyes of Gwen's unemployed father. And the intimate friendship they have treasured all their lives unravels with each new conflict.Visually, the movie is absolutely beautiful. The acting by the two stars is superb, and the characters they play are beautifully developed - fully believable adolescents. Isild Le Besco deftly captures the desperation behind Gwen's freewheeling and promiscuous experimentations with sex, and Karen Alyx infuses Lise with an almost dangerous, introverted fire, remeniscent of Melanie Lynskey in Heavenly Creatures. Many of the supporting roles were very well-played too, especially Sandrine Blancke as Lise's older sister Vivianne and Pascal Elso as Gwen's father Alain. And unlike the vast majority of cinema I've seen, this film makes a marked distinction between sex and nudity. Yes, the girls get naked from time to time; yet, with the exception of one important scene which functions as a major turning point in the story, nearly none of the nudity is involved in the sex. The love/hate duality of the relationships among the various characters within the film is honest and believable, and the ""disfunctional""-ness of the two families (and their self-destructive attempts to escape from their own lives) is well-calculated.I can forgive all but one of the film's flaws (lack of any male characters even half as well-defined as the female ones, weak dialogue, lack of narrative coherence, etc.) on account of its strengths. But there is one I cannot forgive. At the climax of the story, a catastrophic event occurs that threatens to destroy the friendship permanently, and the film ends there. There is no aftermath, no resolution of any kind. It merely cuts off at the climax. The effect is tantamount to ending Empire Strikes Back the moment Darth Vader drops his famous bombshell about Luke Skywalker's true pedigree. All the more so because not only do you never find out what this does to the two girls and their futures, you never find out if the catastrophe that happened was purely an accident, as it seems on the surface, or if Lise had been planning it. It's one of those violations of dramatic structure that can't go by unnoticed or unobjected-to.I'd say rent before you buy it, and judge for yourself if the powerful performances it has going for it make it worth buying despite the fact it's missing its third act.",Girls Can't Swim
345012,"We watched this over 3 nights on dvd and just loved it.  I have never found myself liking a film and the tv series it was based upon equally but am in that situation here.  I loved the American remake film of this series every bit as much as the series.  They are alike yet they are also different.  Perhaps the hugest difference is that the USA one involves a south of the border storyline where the Hispanic world is the major influence on our drug trade.  However, evidently the British drug problem flows from the Middle East and is played across the European stage.  Thus, we spend a great deal of time in Pakistan, Afghanistan and Germany in the UK series.  Because the Hispanic culture is radically different from these others, that is a huge difference between the two and makes both well worth watching.  Benicio del Toro was thus able to make a contribution to the American Traffic as the Hispanic cop that was so riveting.  The rest of the plotline is virtually identical but Bill Patterson is so different from Michael Douglas and Lindsey Duncan so different from Catherine Zeta-Jones that you really understand how a change of actor can totally transform a role.  They are all equally as good but all equally different.  Julia Ormond is excellent as the druggie daughter in this version but Erika Christensen was positively other worldly in her interpretation of the role and I must give her the edge.  I reached the same conclusion after seeing both works: we might as well legalize drugs as the only way of stopping this crime-war.  It is as big a losing battle as Prohibition was with alcohol.",N/A

227632,"Bugs are icky.Entomologists might disagree with me, but black, glistening, chitinous exoskeletons evoke a primal revulsion in many people. Wasps are the worst--they're cruel-looking, aggresive predators. H.R Giger tapped this nerve when he envisioned the creature for &quot;Alien,&quot; and James Cameron (with Stan Winston) pushed those buttons even harder when he tweaked the design for the sequel. Plus, Cameron's film shows more of the aliens in motion, and their agile leaping and lightning-quick striking movements are fundamentally unsettling.Ripley, the sole survivor of the first film is returned to Earth, where she learns that people have begun settling the world she visited. When communications are mysteriously cut off, Ripley accompanies a band of Colonial Marines to investigate. After landing on the desolate planet, they discover the entire colony is missing, except for one small girl named Newt.  The marines inadvertently swagger into a hive of lurking parasites, where chaos quickly breaks loose. The marines' overconfident bravado proves to be their undoing--they DRASTICALLY underestimate their foe.Ripley, Newt and the last few Marines are left to figure out an escape, while hordes of murderous aliens converge on their position...The DVD release, touted as a &quot;director's cut,&quot; includes 17 unnecessary minutes. Most of the additions are insignificant, but a restored sequence fleshing out Ripley's backstory detracts from her relatonship with Newt--the fact that Ripley once had a daughter makes her bonding with Newt more contrived. I always thought it made for a more well-rounded character that Newt ignited a maternal instinct in the tough, ordeal-scarred Ripley.Like most &quot;special editions,&quot; I wish they'd included the original theatrical cut on the disc.

47154,"Happy Gilmore is an impressive comedy for more than a few reasons.  It's nice to see a good Adam Sandler movie after his more recent crimes against humanity.  This is a very easy going movie and a great film to watch if you are in the mood for some good laughs.  The unorthodox manner in which Sandler delivers his entertainment is rather refreshing throughout most of this picture and keeps the mood light for the length of the movie.I have to say I do take partial to the fact that Happy Gilmore is a washed up hockey player wannabe with more than a low-grade bad temper and a penchant for comedy.  I think we can all relate to Gilmore a little during the movie because sometimes you just want to throw things, hit people, scream loudly and make a big scene because your ticked off.The only truly far-fetched concept in this movie is that a Boston fan wins a championship.  Other than that, its a good movie to get into when you don't want to worry about reality too much.

153414,"Under the guise of a low-budget science-fiction movie, `The Man From Planet X' (why `Man'?) is a subversive work featuring typically atmospheric Ulmer visuals. Its starting point seems simple enough: coming from a mysterious planet which is rushing towards Earth, a spaceship ends up in Scotland; various stock characters - professor Elliott and Dr. Mears, scientists with contrasting personalities; prof. Elliott's daughter Enid; Lawrence, a dashing reporter; and, later, a group of anonymous officers and inspectors - try to learn more about the spaceship and its strange-looking pilot. At first sight, the villain (Mears) and the heroes (both Elliots, Lawrence, the officers and inspectors) seem clearly identified, but there's more than meets the eye. The spaceship's pilot, by far the film's most important character, is neither an outright hero nor an enemy; his motivations are never revealed, and the way humans react around him tells a lot about them. If the creature eventually becomes hostile, it's because Mears resorted to violence in order to obtain secrets he planned to use for his sole profit; but this, in turn, is caused by prof. Elliot and Lawrence, who let Mears alone with the creature. Furthermore, fears of a possible invasion are based on assumptions which are never verified, because late in the film both `enemies' (Mears and the now hostile creature) die and planet X doesn't crush the Earth. The irresponsible choices made by the `heroes' thus prevent the initial contact with non-humans from bringing interesting information to both races, and what appears to be a semi-happy ending is only, at best, a return to status quo.",N/A

For a film that runs nearly two hours, it flies by rather quickly, with a lot of suspense and good performances from everyone involved, all leading up to a tense climax on an East River island that looks like it came from an old Hammer horror film.I like how the story of this film was brought to the screen.  Again it was another movie that was taken from a novel.  These days we are getting many movies that are like this, but when they work, I can not see any problem with that.  The novel this film was based on was &quot;Don't Say A Word&quot; by Andrew Klavan.This film has an interesting side to it, by fact that it has many different stories rolled into one.  Firstly you have the bad guys, who are in a spot of bother after years of trying to change the past.  You have the family of the Conrad's, which is important for viewers to try and be close too.  Then the relationship between Nathan Conrad (Douglas) and Elisabeth (Murphy), which is of most importance to the whole story.

36851,"It was with unprecedented anticipation that I awaited this film.  The prior collaboration of this team of talented filmmakers resulted in the production of my favorite film of all time: The Shawshank Redemption.  And, indeed, while The Green Mile hasn't assumed that title, it certainly remains one of the greatest movies I've ever seen, one of the greatest movies ever made.  Some argue and complain about its length.  I counter with the claim that length is only of importance when you can count the minutes pass; in the case of The Green Mile, the film is far too entertaining to ever bore, far too involving to ever allow the viewer to exit back through the fourth wall and out into the audience again.  It is that engaging, that beautiful a film, and it deserves all the respect one can bestow upon it.Simply put, the story is positively phenomenal.  Some might find a few of the films more somber plot points to resonate with a silly perversion, but with the backward light one cannot help but admire everything that went into creating this tale.  The structure is magnificent, as we travel from episode to episode, covering every fascinating subplot and side-story, and then intertwining all of them together in the end.  Acting is phenomenal.  Tom Hanks, like always, cannot disappoint.  Michael Clarke Duncan plays a role that no other actor could have played.  Even in the DVD documentary, director Frank Darabont makes comment on the difficulty in casting the role as John Coffey.  Certainly, Duncan has all of the physical attributes that make him appropriate for the part, but moreover his performance excels beyond what anyone expected.  The character in the novel is one that can hardly be imagined, it is such an innocent brute of gentleness, yet Duncan manages to capture all of that and more.  Frank Darabont's direction is immaculate, as always.  It's amazing what he is able to accomplish in such a limited set.  Most of the film occurs within the death row penitentiary block, yet he somehow manages to capture a new image in every shot, making it perpetually interesting, and never redundant despite its solitary location.In short this film not only met my high expectations, it exceeded them.  I had read the books years prior, enjoyed them heavily, and thus waited eagerly for the film adaptation.  Every aspect of this film is enjoyable; every aspect is entertaining; and so when this is assembled into a near three-hour movie, length no longer becomes an issue.  The film keeps a steady pace that develops and moves on, never straying--though bearing the appearance that it is--from the ultimate plot.  The finished product is a near seamless adaptation of a fine book, transporting it to an exceptional movie.  It has become a perfect addition to my DVD collection, making a fine companion besides it's sister film, Shawshank.  Indeed, Mile even manages to surpass Shawshank in several respects: it has a more emotional basis, its stories are better entwined, it conquers the mood of the moment more wholly.  The Green Mile stands as one of filmmaking's best, one of my favorites, and one that is sure to please you as well.",N/A
589233,"Like other non conventional movies before it, ""Vanilla Sky"" takes a few viewings before its true impact sinks in.Once it does, you realize the film is a multi-textured masterpiece that offers,underneath it's bizarre style and fractured time structure, a number of deeply felt life lessons about love, friendship, sex and dreams.Tom Cruise gives the best performance of his career (the scene in which he phones Sofia (Penelope Cruz) and leaves the ""our old friend 'Benny the Dog' message on her machine, is perhaps Cruise's finest piece of acting to date..The monolouge given by Cruise's Life Extention Tech Support representative (brilliantly played by Noah Taylor) in which Taylor explains how Cruise's dream life was fashioned by the pop culture icons of his youth, is moviemaking at its finest.The entire supporting cast (Penelope Cruz, Cameron Diaz, Jason Lee, and Kurt Russell) is simply sensational.I've avoiding discussing actual details of the plot since ""Vanilla Sky"" is a movie that has to be seen and digested to be fully appreciated.Cameron Crowe directs from his own screenplay (based on the Spanish film ""Abre Los Ojos"") and does a masterful job.The properly eclectic soundtrack features, among others, Bob Dylan, REM, Paul Mc Cartney, Radiohead and the Beach Boys.******The DVD presentation is excellent and includes  two featurettes(""Prelude to a Dream"" and ""Hitting it Hard"" (""Hard"" is 10 minute documentary that covers the 'Vanilla Sky' American-European press tour in which Cruise is shown being worshipped by adoring fans from the UK to South Korea).Note--there is also a ""hidden"" special feature that contain a 6 minute ""gag"" reel of outtakes...to acccess it: go to the ""still photos"" section...highlight ""special features"" and then click on the Tom Cruise mask.)Crowe owes fans of the film a special edition DVD sometime in the future that might include a video commentary by the director and stars (ala the new Jerry MacGuire DVD) and the full length ""Hitting It Hard"" which shows why Cruise is today's quintessential movie star).",Vanilla Sky VHS

I'm not sure there were people like that in Cortes' time. But you have to ignore these kind of mistakes -- like you have to ignore the impossibility of Tulio and Miguel speaking the same language as the people of El Dorado -- otherwise how did they understand each other?I especially enjoyed the fact that there was no character exclusively in the movie to provide the kind of 'comic relief' of Mushu in Mulan. The humor was natural, not forced, it came directly from the situations and the dialogue.The music was not remarkable and did not fit in with the action very good. Also, I absolutely dislike Rosie Perez and her accent was very, very, very annoying. Also, I did not like the ending -- without giving it away I will just say I would have preferred if they did what Miguel wanted to do.I didn't mind the so-called nudity -- there was really no nudity and the love scene was just suggested, a young kid would not get the point at all.In my book, this film stays on a par with &quot;The Emperor's New Groove&quot;.

144727,"&quot;Jezebel&quot; is a marvelous vehicle for Bette Davis, and won her an Academy Award, although it may have prevented her from starring as Scarlett O'Hara in Selznick's &quot;Gone With the Wind.&quot; Although it features a rather a pot-boiler of a plot, set in New Orleans against the gathering stormclouds of Civil War America, Davis's Miss Julie shines as a headstrong, passionate girl, determined to flout convention to have her way.Yellow fever, endemic to the New Orleans environment with its undrained swamps and bad sewers, strikes at the heart of Miss Julie's world, and she grows as a character and wins redemption in the way she meets a crisis.Davis is simply superb and makes the whole production come alive in this well-deserved Oscar winning role.  Highly recommended.",N/A
526612,"when this film came out back in 2000, i wisely read the reviews---not from just one critic, mind you; i like to get a wide view of opinions--and learned that this film was horribly created. having read those reviews, i stayed away from the film at the theatres. last night, while flipping through the channels, i noticed it on Showtime and was curious to see how terrible it really was. right from the beginning, i realized this was worse than the campy sci-fi films of the 50s. those you could at least laugh at. but this was just utterly horrendous. while i admire John Travolta's attempt to bring to the film a great book, one dear to his heart, why did he chose that director and cinematographer? what was up with those camera angles? why did we need to see Johnnie and co. from a 37 degree angle? what was wrong with just a straight angle? what was up with the terrible editing? in other words, HOW COULD IT EVEN BE PRODUCED?",Battlefield Earth VHS
491935,"This movie is a ""play within a film"" that juxtaposes two time periods, often combining the two. The film begins in Quebec in 1952, where a Bishop has been summoned to a prison to hear an inmate's confession. The chapel is filled with other inmates, and the Bishop goes to the Confessional. While there, the rest of the inmates, plus the Chaplain, lock the Bishop inside the confessional so that he can view the inmates acting out a re-creation of the events that intertwine the Bishop and the convict's lives.We discover that the convict, Simon, knew the Bishop as a young boy in 1912, when they were students at a boy's school. Simon was in love with a fellow student, Valier, but the future Bishop also lusted after the enticing Simon. Simon is punished by his father for loving another boy, and agrees to a sham marriage. But, ultimately, he is drawn back to his true love, Valier. This leads to the conflict, the death of Valier, and Simon being falsely imprisoned for murder of his great love, all due to the bitterness of the Bishop.This film is highly unusual in that you see the inmates performing the play in the chapel, then you see the same actors sent back in time to 1912, playing the same parts. Then, you will see the Bishop and the older Simon observing the events of 1912. There are no women in this film. Even in the flashbacks, the inmate-actors portray both male and female characters.This is not an explicit gay film, by any means. Although there is one very tender, passionate scene of the young Simon and Valier kissing intensely, while naked in a bathtub. The majority of the film is about Simon's past, and bringing the truth out to the dupilicitous Bishop. The acting and photography are excellent, and while the story may be a bit difficult to follow at first, you will need to keep in mind that we are seeing the convicts portraying this tale, even when we go back in time.It is a very romantic, very well-made, and also a very tragic film.",Lilies VHS

581174,"The Tommy and Tuppence mysteries are frothier and lighter than the Miss Marple or Hercule Poirot mysteries, but it's their lightness that makes them unique. They're well translated into film in this delightful threepack of the first five mysteries.""Secret Adversary"" is the only movie-length episode: Tommy and Tuppence, childhood friends, reunite post WW1 in financially tight circumstances. To drum up some money, they decide to become adventurers. But their lighthearted venture becomes deadly serious when they become enmeshed in an international situation involving a packet of secret documents, a mysterious girl named Jane Finn, an American millionaire and an elusive mastermind called only ""Mr. Brown.""""Affair of the Pink Pearl"" takes place a while after ""Adversary,"" and is definitelty frothier. Tommy finds the cure for Tuppence's boredom: a detective agency, which they take over and inject new life into. Soon they are called on to retrieve a stolen pink pearl.""The House of Lurking Death"" is the destination of T&T;, when an appealing young woman comes to tell them that someone in her house sent her poisoned chocolates. At first it seems to be a straightforward case -- but nothing is as simple as it seems.""Finessing the King"" is a little more gruesome than its predecessors. Tuppence drags Tommy to a costume ball and then to the restaurant ""Ace of Spades,"" where they find a woman in a Queen of Hearts costume, stabbed on the floor. All evidence points to her lover, including her dying words, but of course nothing is so simple.""The Clergyman's Daughter"" comes to T&T; with her problems: She thinks that her house may be haunted, by a poltergeist that is scaring off the paying guests she has there. The two travel to the house to find out exactly what the source of the mayhem is.If you are expecting the same level of complexity as a Poirot/Wimsey/Marple mystery, you will be disappointed. With the exception of ""Adversary,"" these mysteries were all based on short stories, and so they can't afford to be too complex. Nevertheless, they are enormous fun and some of them will definitely keep you guessing. There's plenty of wry comedy in this series, including Tuppence's turn as a weird spiritualist, her array of hats (""there are... NUANCES to them!""), and Albert's obsession with movies. (His dying gangster act is especially funny)Francesca Annis is enormous fun as Tuppence, with a delightfully flaky charm that covers a brain as brilliant -- if not more brilliant -- than Tommy's. Her 1920s wardrobe is definitely eye-catching; she is also one of the few women I've ever seen who could make Audrey Hepburn look buxom. James Warwick is as noticeable in a quieter way as Tommy, with his cute smile, delightfully confused attitude, and attempts at Sherlock-Holmesian suavity and brilliance. Reece Dinsdale is flawless as Albert, the loyal sidekick with a weakness for Rudolph Valentino movies.Some of the secondary actors are not quite as good; almost the entire cast of ""House of Lurking Death"" (except the fanatic) is about as expressive as pine boards with painfully civil dialogue, the girl playing Lois overdoes the breathy damsel act, and the Esther actress is hammy, period. The title character of ""Clergyman's Daughter"" also has an annoying habit of starting every sentence with a strained ""oh."" The other supporting actors are very good, though.This is a delightful collection, and well worth watching.","Agatha Christie's Partners in Crime - Tommy & Tuppence, Set 1 VHS"
71740,"Why remake Psycho? Does Gus van Sant really think he can upstage Hitchcock? I don't suppose he really did have such high aspirations, but if not, why did he make this film?The script remains virtually unaltered from Joseph Stefano's original. Joseph Walker's shots are duplicated with a few variations that add little. The score by Bernard Herrmann is rearranged minimally, for the most part, by Danny Elfman, and the original titles by Saul Bass are revamped in glorious technicolour. The attempts to copy Hitchcock's masterly mise-en-scene in almost every detail merely look pretentious. It worked the first time because it was Hitchcock, and he gave something new: repeating it all for a second time completely misses the point. By now everyone knows what happens to Marion Crane; by now everyone is familiar with all the little Hitchcockian touches. This is a joke. It has the feel of a load of juvenile Hitchcock admirers getting together to have some fun mimicking their hero with a camcorder. What invention or creativity went into this? What were the makers hoping to achieve? If Psycho had to be remade, it demanded something fresh, a new slant, not merely a retreading of what went before.In the final analysis, nothing can redeem the film from the fact that it is simply a waste of time and money. Technically, the film is fine. It is even interesting and amusing to watch for the all the minor details that are painstakingly recreated almost exactly from the original. Unfortunately, that is about ALL there is to it.",N/A

30597,"This is perhaps Allen's most consistently funny offering of recent years. Here, Allen plays a neurotic writer who finds it easier to manage the semi-fictional world of his characters (projections of family, friends and his own fears and psychological hangups) than the real world. So far, the character is just an extension of the same cynical New York-Jewish type that he has been playing for years. The originality is found in the stories within the story. The traumas and dilemmas that face Allen's character find themselves worked out in surreal and quite ingenious vignettes, firstly in the realm of his fiction, but increasingly in his day-to-day life, as things go from bad to worse. As ever, Allen exploits every irony, and is frequently hilariously sardonic as he explores the world of the archetypal, tragic neurotic, to whom life has dealt one hard blow.On the downside, the bad language is more frequent and offensive than any other Allen film, and the sexual content more explicit (visually). Other than that, this one will have you in stitches.",N/A

Does anyone out there wonder why we can't have a LBX DVD version?

671578,"It's disheartening to see all the reviews claiming the lead character 'Elle Woods' in LEGALLY BLONDE is ""ditzy"".  That is so far removed from the truth and I don't want possible buyers led astray.  So here's the real deal.First and formost, this is NOT a movie about a ""dumb blonde"".  This movie is about the President of fictional sorority Delta Nu, who is a fashion merchandising major with a 4.0 grade point average.  She IS smart when it comes to her field of study and all surrounding subjects.  This is proved when she goes with her friends (one of whom, as a result of hanging out in nail salons, speaks fluent Korean!!) to buy the perfect dress for what she thinks will be the night her boyfriend Warner (Mathew Davis from Pearl Harbor) proposes to her.  The sales clerk of the botique, thinking Elle must be a dumb blond, tries to pass off an old dress with a propensity to snag as a one-of-a-kind original.  Elle quickly, and sweetly, let's her know she is NOT dumb, ditzy or willing to be taken advantage of.When Warner breaks up with her because he needs a serious girl like the ""Vanderbilt"" one his brother is marrying, she is crushed.  But after noticing his soon-to-be sister in law is a law student, she has her plan; she too must attend law school!  And from there, we ride a roller coaster of Elle studying for the LSAT's, making her wonderfully inventive admissions video and doing what even Warner was not able to do...get into Harvard Law School On Her OWN Merits!Along the way, we meet Vivian, Warner's new fiancee and Elle's competition, and a whole host of others who will be for or against Elle during her quest to win Warner back.  But after a crushing blow or two, Elle soon figures out that actual studying, faith and a seriousness she HAS ALWAYS possessed, is all she needs to survive and prove, Not To Warner, but to Herself, that she Does Indeed Belong at Harvard.  She isn't GIVEN a position as helper on a sensation murder case.  She EARNS IT with her outspoken and legally on point answers in class.  And goes on to prove that Cosmo girls with intelligence and someone who believes in them, can do anything.This movie shows true intelligence, integrity and endurance wrapped up in a fluffy, child friendly ""girl power"" environment.  The fact that my 13 year old Son LOVED the movie says a great deal.  So don't believe this is another ""dumb blonde"" movie.  Reese Witherspoon has gained a fan for life in me with this triumphant trip to Harvard that far surpasses anything I've ever seen in the genre.  HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!! :o)",Legally Blonde
668630,"This boxed set would be a great addition to any DVD or VHS collection of any scientists.  Of course, if you are interested in learning the evolutionists' point of view, this will also be a great addition.  We must remember, however, that evolution is a theory and will never be proven as fact.  That being said, the creationists' view is that there is a God.  OK.  Here's where it gets difficult for some. Evolution is a theory, but creationism is also.  I do believe in God; however, no one was there at the time.  We HAVE to believe he did all this.Science, on the hand, is basically problem-solving in a methodical way, using evidence.  Some of you are saying I'm wrong, and I might be.  Nonetheless, science has to rely on &quot;evidence.&quot;  This evidence leads us to certain conclusions.I used to mix the two (creationism and evolution), believing that God may have created man, but how He did it is the question.I know kmany people will disagree, but creationism gives credit to someone who did things that no one was around to see.  Science, on the other hand, must look at evidence and derives conclusions from them.  One must remember, however, that theories can always be wrong.  Look at Lamarckism or Heackel's ideas.  Science is only about our conclusions on a problem.Science cannot, and will not, say there is a God.  If they did, we might as well throw everything out of the door. including medicine.

(Even Toy Story 2 was a little better than this.)Some standout performances by Billy Crystal (America's Sweethearts, Analyze That) and John Goodman (Emperor's New Groove, What Planet Are You From?)and even Jennifer Tilly (Stuart Little, The Muse) and of course some great gag bits and slapstick humor for a computer generated film. Directed by Peter Doctor (writer of Toy Story 1 &amp; 2) who gives the film a flavor of color and flare.The story is that of the concept that monsters scare you under your bed in and in your closet as a kid and this is how they do it. Very mechanical and very routine. Their job is to collect the screams of the scars and then turn it into power and energy for Monstropolis. There is one fear; the Monsters are more scared of the kids they scare then the kids themselves. Guess what? One gets in the Monster world.

308350,"Tony Richardon's grim evocation of the experience of one bottom feeder at the low base of Britain's crumbling class pyramid features editing as harsh - and cinematically effective, especially in the film's well-placed flahsbacks - as this story of hard-bitten young Colin Smith (grittily portrayed by Tom Courtenay). For a petty theft Smith is sentenced to borstal (reform school) where his speed in the long distance run elevates him, in the eyes of his inmate brethren, to become the &quot;guvnor's blue-eyed boy&quot;, because the warden's goal is to win the special long distance running cup in the borstal's trial athletic competition against an upper-class public school.  Smith finds himself trapped between the guvnor's self-serving, manipulative solicitude and the class-based peer pressure of his borstal mates. Courtenay plays out Smith's repsonse to his dilemma with breathless, bristling, teeth-clenched defiance that the film, grippingly, doesn't reveal until its withering d&eacute;nouement.Avis Bunnage lends a biting performance as Smith's mother: a woman hardened by her straitened life circumstance as the working class widow of a resentful factory worker, struggling on welfare to raise her children in a grimy, shabbily built, claustrophobic low-income dwelling. Alec McCowen, as the borstal's pyschologist, deftly adds depth to the story as a well-meaning advocate of fresh approaches to rehabilitating inmates, whose efforts are trumped by the warden's timeworn methods. As the warden Michael Redgrave communicates all that's right - and wrong - about the upper reaches of the class pyramid.Developed from a short story by Alan Sillitoe (author of Saturday Night and Sunday Morning, and screenwriter of that  eponymous 1961 film), rooted in industrial Nottigham, filmed in sooty, bleak black &amp; white, 1962's The Loneliness of the Long Distance Runner may, in 2002, feel a bit dated, yet its theme of the bottom-of-the-food-chain working class individual clamped in the maws of animals and powers beyond his influence remains trenchant, timeless and thought-provoking.",N/A

The premise is interesting, and given a small budget, the film is passable.The acting, aside from brief and rare moments of talent, is as wooden as I've ever seen.  I'd have given my eye teeth for a decent drama queen to say or do something that showed some emotion or feeling behind the dialogue.  Speaking of dialogue - it seemed to be forcing itself to some sort of gay intellectualism - but by re-using the words 'visceral connection' about 10 times (and not during the 'repeated' scenes) it came across as monotonous and boring.I applaud anyone who has the ability to get an indie film made, and this one wasn't necessarily BAD, but I don't think it offered any new perspectives or thoughts on the issue of relationships or compatibility, it just rehashed old ones in a completely unemotional way.

590187,"Opinions are sharply divided in this film, and I can see why.  First of all I have to say that it was very unfortunate that it was marketed as a murder mystery because it isn't.  Sure, there's a murder, but that's treated as hardly important at all.  So if you want murder in the 1930s, read Agatha Christie.Secondly, maybe I'm just dumb, but I could hardly keep track of all the characters, especially the upper-class ones (was this meant to be an ironic comment or something?  How all the upper-class people are vapid conformists?)  There were too many brown-haired rich women and too many men in suits and it just got really confusing.  For this reason, I didn't really enjoy the upper-class scenes because I couldn't work out how people related to each other or why they were saying things or...or anything.The working-class scenes were much better and are the main reason why I'm giving this movie 3 stars.  It really brought home to me how unfair the class system was and the contrast between the lives of the servants and their employers.This movie could have used some cutting.  I'm sorry, but it could.  No matter how interesting characters are (and these weren't THAT interesting) you can't expect everything they do to be interesting.  Any scene they have should advance the story.  That was my main problem with this movie - I like something where plot is considered as well as character.I was sickened to see all the reviews here which act patronising and say 'oh, if you didn't like this movie you're a dumb brainless hick who only wants explosions and sex.'  I resent that implication!  Just because someone doesn't like the same things you do does not mean they are stupid - honestly, that's the sort of thing you teach little children.Anyway, if you REALLY like things set in the 1930s, or if you're interested in class differences, or if you don't like fast-paced films, Gosford Park may be for you.  Just don't see it for the mystery.  Really, really don't.",N/A

It grounds their inauspicious beginnings in the context of the music world of the time. It shows the influence of American music on the youth of England, who, in turn, would end up influencing the youth of the United States in ways that could not have been foreseen. The Beatles were to be the catalyst for the rising success of British pop stars who would dominate the music industry years to come.There is some very early footage of The Beatles in their earliest incarnations as the Quarrymen and the Silver Beetles. There is also footage of Stuart Sutcliffe, a former band member and friend, who died early in the band's career. There is also footage of their original drummer, hunky Pete Best. The film details the reason for the change in drummers, as well as the role each member played in the group.From Liverpool to Germany to the United States for their record shattering debut on the Ed Sullivan variety show, this film captures it all. The film also showa the musical development of the group, as well as the forces that were to later drive them apart. It expertly details the beginning and the end of the greatest and most inflential rock band to ever grace the music world.The viewer can expect to be treated to a rock and roll exposition with film clips of early Cliff Richards, Billy Preston, and Tony Sheridan, among others. An older Gerry Marsden of Gerry and the Pacemakers fame (Ferry 'Cross the Mersey) expertly expounds on the influence of American music on the early British pop scene and the rise of the skiffle bands. There are also clips from those who had worked with The Beatles early on in their career, as well as those who worked with them long term, such as George Martin.Best of all, there is the music and lots of it. The film is a veritable cornucopia of sound and a treasure trove of information about a musical past that still influences us today. All in all, this is an outstanding documentary that should appeal to those who are fond of this genre, as well as those who are fans of The Beatles, music lovers everywhere, and those who simply love a good film.

153795,"If you've never seen this movie before, let me remind you that it was made in 1982, so forgive the bad guys for wearing Village People clothing. It's another great vision from John Carpenter, with Kurt Russell taking the excellent lead role as &quot;Snake Pliskin&quot;.When this movie hit the theatres, it was probably one of the best futuristic movies ever made. Set in 1997, it imagines the City of New York transformed into a maximum-security prison. Ordinary criminals shunned by a weary society are left to fend for themselves behind the massive walls of the city. The inmate characters portrayed in this movie are unique in style and behavior. A few are just down-right weird (The Duke's #2 man is my favorite). Snake Pliskin is given a chance for freedom in exchange for saving the president (a self-interested and thankless character play by Donald Pleasance), who's plane has been hijacked and crashed into the city. Pliskin must fight off numerous gangs and thugs to reach the president and free him from his captors. But time is his biggest enemy, as you will see.If you can get past the Control Room set, with thousands of useless flashing lights, ugly limo's, giant face-shields, super-sized watches (heck, I had a digital watch back in '82, and it was nowhere near the size of Pliskins) and bad guys wearing Sally Jessy Rafael glasses, you'll still enjoy this movie. The excellent settings of the city and the musical score (Carpenter's specialty) intensify his vision of a bleak and hopeless future for a once-great city overrun by crime.There's a hole in the storyline, though. When Pliskin first gets injected with those micro-size charges, the doctor reassures him that they can burn out those charges with x-rays 15 minutes before his time is up. But he only has seconds left when they finally get to him, according to his huge watch. So, should Snake have died? Hell, no! The name's Pliskin!Isn't it weird that Carpenter's best movies were made when he didn't have a big budget to play with. THE FOG is a good example of that. With that said, do yourself a favor and don't watch (or buy) the sequel, Escape from L.A. It is one of the worst sequels I've ever seen. What was he thinking? It's full of ridiculous scenes (the surfing comes immediately to mind) and fails to follow up on the previous film's effect. A big disappointment. Mr. Carpenter, if your going to make a sequel to one of your other great early films, please try to keep the storyline and atmosphere in check with the prior film. We dont need the million dollar explosions or outrageous plots to enjoy the film. Stick to the basics that made you so successful early on.",N/A
132683,"I put off seeing this for a long time due to the extremely bad reviews, but got cornered into seeing it the other day.  I did find some admirable things about it, which I'll end the review to put it on a positive note.  But it also has a bunch of problems which makes one think that Hollywood's idea of the world earns them the title of ""La-La-Land"".The story involves a pair of best friends, a gay male and hetero female,  who have a drunken liason one night that produces a child.  What I thought was going to be a comedy (as it was billed) about the adventures that this causes turns out to be a much more serious movie about other things, some good, some bad.First, we have a gardener and a yoga instructor pooling incomes.  Sorry folks, these jobs don't pay a lot.  While not living extravagantly, they still seem to have a lifestyle that goes way beyond their realistic incomes.  This is just the first of many ways the movie is interested in portraying eye candy more than telling an even remotely realistic story.Continuing on the eye-candy role was the complete avoidance of hard-times that come with evey new baby.  Since they chose to take a very serious tone in the movie, they could have shown Madonna dragging her butt out of bed at 3 a.m. to answer a cry, or hunky Everett cleaning up a big mess.  But we see this apparantly absolutely perfect baby's first years bypassed to produced an apparantly absolutely perfect child.  In this world, you can't be bad-looking or out of shape.So while the movie falls apart with no connection to reality whatsoever, I did find some things that salvaged a bit of it.  When I still thought this was going to be a comedy, I was prepared to see a bunch of situations where certain cast members would not know the whole story, and there would be scenes to cover-up the situation.  It was refreshing to see that the whole story was explained to each character as they entered the picture.  The way all the characters acted here did give it a bit of intelligence, and it was refreshing to not see his parents freak out.  I also liked that the movie averted negative gay stereotypes, but when the movie ended, and I heard one of my kids crying, it was nice to get back to reality.",The Next Best Thing

It is a hi-tech computer capable of reproducing a physical reality to all of us, humans. Once the humans created artificial intelligence, it quickly turned against us and it started a war of man against machine. Brain against software. And since the machines get their energy form the sun, the military scorched the sky, turning it into pitch black. But the machines were clever. They didn't need the sun to survive, they just needed some sort of energy, and they found that energy on the electrical impulses of our bodies. So all humans were taken as slaves and they were put into this huge prison, where they keep humans sleeping, but dreaming about reality, a reality created by the matrix so the human brains can keep working and producing all the energy the machines need to stay alive.But Thomas Anderson feels that reality is a little weird. It feels strange, he always has the feeling that he is dreaming because... he is! So that's why he's contacted by Morpheous, one of the people who's not in the Matrix. Morpheous believes Anderson is the key player to destroy the matrix and set all humans free. But before they do that, he has to convince Tom Anderson he's special and that he can do a lot more than what he believes.What we have here is one of the most interesting and intelligent science fiction films of all times. Yes, I said that. I've always liked Keanu Reeves and Laurence Fishburne, but they practically seem like they were born for these roles! And this film is quite a treat for both the eyes and the brain. I was very pleased after I watched this movie, because it's not one of those sci-fi films that use special effects just to cover its plot holes or script weakness. The Matrix uses special effects only when it's necessary and the final result is outstanding!It has also one of the greatests soundtracks and scores I've heard and the whole deal about perception is something that will leave you thinking long after the final credits. If you're into sci-fi, and more especially, if you're into intelligent films, this one's for you!

718937,I admit This movie was much better than I ever expected. This movie would have gotten a 5 if it weren't for the ending. This storyline is the classic Murder/Revenge-Student/Teacher plot you get in most Kung fu flix. But the training sequences rival that ofthe Master Killer. The young student must past the 18 tests in order to get a Famous Fighting styles book. Its not too fake though because he gets his butt whipped plenty of times. So bad you start to feel sorry for the guy. The fight scene with the 80 year old monk who looks like a kid is worth the whole movie. I recommend this as Classic Kung fu.

65692,"Bride of Frankenstein is the sequel to Frankenstein, and has Boris Karloff return playing the monster. This film deals with more mature topics than the first Frankenstein, but I find Bride not as enjoyable. In this film we learn the monster has survived and begins roaming the village, scaring everyone. They imprison him but he escapes, and meets a blind man who befriends him, and teaches him things. Meanwhile a fellow scientist named Dr. Pretorious goes to Frankenstein and details his plan to make a mate for the monster, so they can spawn a new race. Frankenstein wants no plans, but is forced to help create this new creature when his wife is held hostage.I did not enjoy this film as much as the first Frankenstein, but this one is great on its own as well. The film is taken very seriously, and deals with serious topics, and has a lot to discuss and interpret. Homosexuality, necrophilia, and sacrilege undertows are present. There is also interesting philosophy discussed in this film as well. To fans of these types of horror/monster films, you will love this film. But to more general film lovers, I'd suggest the first Frankenstein, and if you loved it, then try this one out. 4 stars.",N/A
2810,"Lambero Bava is a classic example of how some guys have all of the potential in the world and it goes to waste. We all know who his pop was...Mario? Just kidding. And as an Argento protege (assistant director on TENEBRAE), ol' Lamberto STILL couldn't make a great film if he tried. While A BLADE IN THE DARK and MACABRE were okay offerings, Lamberto put on a different hat and took a shot at this weird take on zombies. Since zombies were old news, they are substituted for demons that look like them and threw in some nonsense by making their existance relevant. Not too many people have read Nostrodamus' book 'Centuries' but I have a good idea that Nostrodamus wouldn't have predicted that a Bava would make a movie this hilarious. The effects are decent and the 'demon' mask was an inventive touch but I couldn't take this movie as seriously as it was intended to be. Goblin returned to add a film score (due to Dario Argento's connections, no doubt) but also in the soundtrack are popular 80's metal bands like Accept. 'Fast as a Shark' is a good song but listenting to it while watching DEMONS just makes for a few laughs. For all of the Italio-purists, I would tell them to buy this film to complete your DVD collection.

With his aquiline features, nervous ticks, abrupt action &amp; words, with just the appropriate dose of arrogance, he's the Sherlock of the high-strung disposition I remember reading about.  The British Granada TV series presented these stories with great fidelity to the material, good production values, and appearances by some of the best of British actors: some familiar,  some just getting started.The Blue Carbuncle is a tale of a stolen gem with a long history of violence behind it.  The mystery is okay, but the highlight is Holmes challenging Watson &amp; then analyzing a left-behind hat and deducing a dozen things about the owner from it, to Watson's chagrine.The Copper Beeches cast is made up of Joss Auklund, familiar to many in the US, and introduces a very young Natasha Redgrave (to British TV audiences).  The chief interest is in Holmes' at first dismissive attitude toward Redgrave, and then upon discovery that she is alone in the world, his care and concern for her (against his normal misogynist tendencies) and his growing regard for her intelligence &amp; courage.Ably backed by David Burke as an intelligent and capable Watson (no bumbling Nigel Bruce type), these adventures are all of fine quality, only varying due to the strengths or weaknesses of the stories told.",N/A

708683,"Apparently based on a true story (or at least a true myth) Brotherhood of The Wolf is a wonderful movie full of surprises. Part pre-revolutionary French period drama (complete with scantily clad peasant maidens with heaving bosoms and creepy aristocrats), part political allegory, part martial arts movie, and complete with gothic trimmings (a la Hammer House of Horror - secret societies, castles and candle-lit cellars etc.). Brotherhood of The Wolf is no euro art-house movie but it really is a must see.I'm not generally a fan of foreign movies but that's probably because this is only the third foreign movie I've seen on the big screen (the other two were `Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon' And `Amelie'). This movie received such universal high praise that I just felt compelled to go and see it and I must admit that although I initially struggled with the subtitles during the more conversation filled early scenes, after only twenty minutes I had completely forgotten that I was watching a foreign movie with subtitles, so immersed was I in the movie.I don't want to give too much of the plot away, particularly as part of the joy of this movie is its surprise element - just when you think you have the movie sussed it moves in a different direction. Set in France, in 1776, and entirely told in flashback, an unknown and rarely seen beast is terrorising the French rural district of Gevaudan, by killing its women and children. So, King Louis XV dispatches young scientist Gregoire de Fronsac (Samuel Le Bihan) accompanied his Iroquoi native American companion, Mani (Mark Dacascos) to find the uber wolf. On arriving in Gevaudon they find that the soldiers previously sent to catch the beast are more adept at terrorising the locals than they are at hunting, and that region is in a state of complete panic.Director Christophe Gans serves up a stylish period thriller and exhilarating ride, perfectly capturing the period, beautifully photographing the landscapes, seamlessly combined with action scenes of great style and surreal originality. When we are first introduced to de Fronsac and Mani masked and on horseback in the driving rain (a la Dangerous Liasons), they happen across an old man and his whorish daughter being beaten and bullied by brutish soldiers. Cue a change of direction from period drama to action kick ass action movie as Mani delivers a very sound and stylish beating to the thugs, seamlessly directed with the combination of slo-mo and real time action.This is the movie that Tim Burton's `Sleepy Hollow' could have been and should have been. Although the beast special effects (from Jim Henson's workshop( are not the best and perhaps slightly overlong, this is an excellent and very gripping movie, beautifully filmed and directed with superb action and superb acting. Monica Bellucci sizzles as a rather shapely and very attractive high class prostitute. The handsome (in a chunky Gallic way) Samuel Le Bihan makes an great leading man and he is ably supported by the excellent Vincent Cassell (as a menacing one armed aristocrat) and the radiant Emilie Dequenne, as the virtuous Marianne. However, it is Mark Dacascos (Driven) who steals the show as de Fronsacs blood brother Mani. With striking good looks, charisma, and a great deal of both physical presence and martial arts skills, coupled with his acting ability, he lights up the screen and given the opportunity he will go on from here to be an international star.Personally I can't wait until the movie is available on DVD. Apparently Ang Lee described `Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon as Bruce Lee meets Jane Austen', this is much more than Dangerous Liasons meets John Woo meets Hammer House of Horror. This is a real gem of a movie that I am so glad I `discovered'. Stunningly original in its combination of styles and genres and a great example to Hollywood of what they should be producing. Very entertaining!!!(See it now before they make a horrible English language remake).",N/A

406873,"After all these years,I finally did it--I saw ""Moby-Dick"" of my own volition. The family would watch it, ages ago, when it would come on TV, but I usually wandered away and came back in time for the dramatic sinking of the Pequod. Then, last week, I read that it was going to be shown THAT VERY NIGHT in a place called Den of Cin for [low cost]. How could I lose? So off I went.I think I may know now why the movie never seemed to hold my interest as a lilGal. It is miscast, as several of the other reviewers have pointed out, in two crucial roles. Well, at least, there OUGHT to be two crucial roles--that's part of problem number one, Richard Basehart's Ishmael. Ishmael is the narrator of the book, and one could argue that he's supposed to fall out and not be noticed as Everything Else takes place. But does that mean that the actor has to be a nonentity? Malibu Ken in the back closet could've done as well. And, you know, in the New Bedford tavern, old tars and barkeeps keep saying, ""Young feller"", ""Son"", and things like that to Basehart. Um, this guy is not young. Why is this happening? I could have understood if the part were being played by a big name actor too old to have been cast at that time, like say Monty Clift. But since Basehart was never a big star, and he wasn't any spring chicken, what gives? So that's Miscast Number One.No mystery to Miscast Number Two, Gregory Peck as Captain Ahab. After giving a good hard look at a number of Peck's performances, I really have to say that he often fails to bring anything to the table that's at all remarkable or memorable. He's tall and has a deep voice, but no where near the actor that his contemporary Kirk Douglas is. So this Ahab is passionless, though he grimaces often. One reviewer characterized this as Abe Lincoln at sea, but it's more like Silas Barnaby from Laurel and Hardy's ""March of the Wooden Soldiers""--that more exactly conveys the acting style at work here.So what makes the movie, then? Camerawork, editing, and color. The scenes where the crew are harpooning whales before Ahab gets wind of Moby Dick's whereabouts are dazzling. Exhilarating! And I had long ago heard that a special effect was used with the color. But I was told it was to resemble oil paintings, so I had expected a dark murky grainy look. Not at all! These are the light shades of early 19th century whaling prints. Nothing quite like it, before or since.Ergo, you might try weighing anchor and checking out ""Moby Dick"", but the crew's not everything they ought to be.",Moby Dick VHS

After her daughter, Anne, tells her that she's seen a little boy named Victor and other strangers, Grace begins to think her house is haunted.The cinematography of this movie is innovative and brilliant. The lighting is very important as well. In fact, the subject of lights is so well mixed into the story, the dark feels safer and more secure than the light does.

518362,"*Fantasia 2000 (G)- Walt Disney always envisioned Fantasia as a series of never ending films.  With the failure of the original at the box office, the dream was stashed away.  Disney the studio has finally taken the dream out of the cupboard, dusted it off and brought it to beautiful if not complete life.  While Walt Disney put more emphasis (at least on the film Fanatasia) on the art form rather than the commercialability of the product, the factory that his studio has become is too afraid to go the extra mile.  Thus we get an all too short and less mind blowing rendition of its 50-year-old successor.  Don't get me wrong.  Fantasia 2000 is gorgeous, it is beautiful, and at one point I was fighting back tears.  But the abstract beginning of the original film is less abstract, having a storyline even!

Being used while he thinks he is doing the using, the Draughtsman finds out too late that he has been nothing more than a pawn in a game he never understood.Not for everyone, I found the film fascinating but as detached and aloof as its protagonist.  This cold detachment becomes the wry amusement in the story, but also separates us from any emotional connection to the characters.

583256,"Bread and Tulips is wonderful! The DVD cover says it was nominated for international awards and won at least 9 awards; it fully deserves them all!Its simple tale has all the power and universal grandeur of a classical Greek myth or parable. Mainly set in present-day Venice (probably the world's most romantic city with a poignancy, poetry, and proximity to mythical power uniquely its own), it charts the emotional rebirth of a woman who, at movie's start, has become an awkward stranger to the vibrant beauty of her very own heart.The lady's emotional healing slowly touches the lives of others in similar emotionally-bereft lives and, with a wonderful economy of psychological insight into the characters, everyone's everyday tragedies transform into meaningful uplifting relationships with a shared music and mutually-loving harmony.Bread and Tulips is most easily defined as a romantic comedy; yet, it transcends most other modern movies of that genre insofar as it fully honors human emotions and never ridicules or devalues them. A wonderful and heartwarming emotional education of a movie with superb acting igniting it from start to finish; fully recommended.",N/A

526701,"John Travolta has done some bad movies in his career (Michael, Perfect, Phenomenon, Mad City, Two of a Kind). It's too bad because Travolta's a good actor, and has had his share of good movies too (Saturday Night Fever, Pulp Fiction, Grease, Face/Off). But Battlefield Earth is as awful as movies come.He plays Terl, an alien from the planet Psychlo. He looks like hell. They have given him ugly claw-like hands, billowy eyebrows, and a massive bush of dreadlock hair. The make up designer has copied the aliens from Star Trek and Star Wars so he looks like a cross between a Klingon and a Cantina alien.This has also got to be the worst performance of Travolta's career. He tries to make Terl a diabolic, yet sarcastic villain and it just doesn't work. Given, he's working with a horrible script, and doesn't have much support from other cast members, but I expected more of a Darth Vader-like bad guy. Terl is not menacing at all, and quickly turns into a joke rather than a true villain. His appearance on screen is an annoyance as he hams it up, sniffing and cackling somewhat like Jack Nicholson's Joker.Ludicrous is the only word to explain the rest of the film. The script is based on a 1982 novel by the founder of Scientology, L. Ron Hubbard. Travolta is a known follower of Scientology, and maybe that explains why he did the film. It is badly photographed, with set design that is drab and chintzy, looking a lot like Blade Runner (though not nearly as good).  It's the most dismal, depressing art direction and cinematography I've ever seen.It takes place in the year 3000, when mankind is near extinction and many Psychlos have colonized Earth. Terl is Earth's chief of security, patrolling our destroyed cities with his troops and watching over the few humans (man animals!) that are left. Barry Pepper plays Jonnie, who tries to form an uprising and save Earth from Terl and his men. Pepper, who was excellent in Saving Private Ryan and The Green Mile, has very little opportunity to make the role of Jonnie a good one. He does his best, but the character is too dense and shallow.Dark, uninspiring, and just plain rotten, Battlefield Earth left me feeling sorry for Travolta and Pepper who have more potential. A note to John Travolta: Fire your agent and get more films like Pulp Fiction and Get Shorty. If you make the right choices maybe we'll see you with the gold on Oscar night someday. Let's just hope it's not the year 3000. Rated PG-13 for violence and light profanity.

The imaginative plot and the funny dialect make this movie a one that a lot of people would find amusing. Never has the chase between a  cat and a dog been so modern, fun, and exciting. The story doesn't really matter when you are thoroughly amused by the special effects and the computerized characters in the film. This film was an hour and a half of ridiculous fun and amusement. It would be recommended for everyone who liked Harry Potter, Shrek, and even the matrix.

A well written and acted script,and very good special effects lends some credibility to having a powerful earthquake in a relatively low risk zone.  It was eerie seeing the Trade Center again (as so many movies do), suffer damage other than terrorist driven.  The main complaint about the DVD is that it is not widescreen.  Being a TV movie, one would not expect widescreen, but the jewelcase description says ""formatted to fit your TV"", thus it leads one to believe that a widescreen exists.

215488,"I'm glad I bought the original theatrical version DVD of Apocalypse Now!  I loved that film.  Now I have seen the Redux version and I can't see any improvement whatsoever by the added material.  A few more minutes with Kilgore & Kurtz was okay.  Kilgore though was just more of the same, and while the extra business with Kurtz clarified Willard's time of imprisonment, it also made Kurtz less of an enigma.  Well, I like enigmas!Now, the added material with the Playboy bunnies and the French Plantation was ridiculous.  Apocalypse was never a realistic movie, but more a fever dream, delirious and poetic and weird.  But these two extended scenes contributed nothing to the story and the Playboy bunny scene was a reiteration of chaos and lack of command that would be repeated at the last bridge outpost.  Redundancy.  The French Plantation while beautifully photographed (nothing new here, the entire movie is stunningly shot)to convey a ghostly image, is poorly acted and has some of the most inept dialogue in the film.  It too adds nothing.If you see the documentary Coppola's wife made about the actual filming of Apocalypse now, you see the young Francis dissatisfied with the French Plantation and accordingly cutting it.  I trust that Francis Ford Coppola's sense better than the older man now, who probably could use a few bucks for the Napa Winery or whatever.No, I prefer the movie I saw originally.  That wound its way straight up the river into Kurtz's nightmarish world without bounds & limits...hell all too present on earth. The Horror.  There were only occasional side-trips and the narration as well as the narrative flow of images was uninterrupted.So, I ask myself why?  Does Francis Coppola (whose work I cherish) really think this is a better picture than the one his younger self cut?  Or, did he decide he could use a few bucks and everyone was always curious about what he left out?  I don't know and don't care.  I'll keep the older flick and let this one pass.  3-1/2 to 4 stars for this one, 5 for the original.PS I hope this kind of later fiddling with great pictures doesn't become a habit.",N/A

708963,"Sorority Boys is funny just on the basis that the 3 Sorority Boys are seriously the most unconvincing girls I've ever seen.

They're first plan is to sneak into their frat house during a party and they dress up as girls to try to accomplish that but are foiled as they are kicked out and left outside the doorstep of the FOG sorority, a sorority of ""outcast"" girls, who take in the guys thinking they are plus size girls.I went into this movie thinking it was going to stink but it turned out to be really funny. Trust me the 3 guys dressed as the girls are pretty funny plus there's just some really outlandishly funny scenes in this one. Some of the humor is cheap ... jokes but it's still funny.This is a pretty good buy because it'll keep you laughing the whole way through, especially when the girls are playing football and of course, when the DOG girls are partying in their house doing some normal college drug use.

587638,"This stylish retelling of the infamous Jack the Ripper murder killings that took place in London's Whitechapel district during the Fall of 1888 is visceral roller coaster ride that succeeds on all levels; casting, script, direction, cinematography, costuming, and SPFX.Brought to the screen by the brothers Albert and Allen Hughes, these filmmaking twins re-created in vivid detail the great disparity between the lives of the haves and the have-nots of Victorian London, and the evil that exists at all levels of society.While this is an imaginative interpretation of the Alan Moore graphic novel of the same name, this atmospheric film does take necessary liberties in transferring this grisly tale from the printed page to the screen, but it never strays far from the menacing spirit of the original source material.I would not recommend this film for children (due to necessary violence & sexuality), but if you appreciate a well told mystery, gritty realism, and a good scare, this is a film you should check out.Note: The DVD set offers only a so-so commentary, but good additional material and an enthusiastic tour of the film set by the Hughes brothers that's worth checking out.",From Hell

554795,"The year--37,166.  The place:  Zeta Minor, at the fringes of the known universe.  The surviving members of a Morestran survey team are being killed off by an invisible force in a way that resembles ""a rapid form of freeze drying.""  Dr. Sorenson is on the verge of a scientific discovery that could save the Morestran civilization--their sun is dying.  Baldwin, a member of the expedition, manages to activate an SOS as he is being attacked.  Guess who answers the SOS?  A certain jelly-baby loving Time Lord and his assistant.Also en route to Zeta Minor is a military expedition headed by the young and inexperienced Controller, Salamar.  The Doctor and Sarah are captured by Salamar's troops and accused of murdering seven members of Sorenson's expedition.  They escape, only to encounter the cause of the deaths at the cliffhanger to Episode 1.  Speaking of cliffhangers, the one ending Episode 2 is effective, as the Doctor is seen falling into the black pit, seemingly doomed.All the great lines are by the Doctor, but this one covers the overall concept of colonial thinking and Sorenson's mission:  ""Here on Zeta Minor is the boundary between existence as you know it and the other universe which you don't understand.  You call it 'nothing' a word term to cover ignorance, and centuries ago, scientists invented another name for it:  anti-matter.  And you, by coming here, have crossed that boundary into that other Universe to plunder it.""  Sorensen, however, puts it another wayL  ""Full scale exploitation of this planet will provide us with perpetual energy in whatever way we need it.""  The main point being that Sorenson cannot take any minerals of that planet with him.  In the meantime, Sorenson's men are being killed off one by one.Prentis Hancock's impatient action-not-waiting Salamar is a retread of his portrayal as Vaber in Planet Of The Daleks.  But Ewen Solon takes top honors as the older and wiser voice of reason, a variation of the Trojan War's Nestor, as second-in-command Vishinsky.Other notes:  The anti-matter monster, despite being shown corporeally on the video cover, is only seen as a glowing yellow outline, which is an interesting way.  And Elizabeth Sladen's expression, especially her eyes, brilliantly portray that feeling of her mind leaving her body, a sensation she feels whenever the anti-creature is near.  The casualty rate is also high in this story.By Episode Three, there is a clear Jekyll and Hyde theme established.  The larger theme is that of anti-colonialism, a theme previously explored in the Who story The Mutants.  Figures, since the British Empire plundered resources of countries in its domain.  And with this story, the British, by experience, portrays the immorality of exploiting other countries for their wealth.  Sounds like a country I'm familiar with.  A worthy story in the Dr. Who canon.",N/A
368154,"In this lesser-known Errol Flynn action vehicle, he stars as Canadian Mountie Steve Wagner who tangles with Nazis on a mission in Canada to bomb an important canal.  Since Flynn's character is the son of German parents, he works undercover with his sympathies being questioned by both sides.  The set up scenes for Flynn's undercover work are weakly written and directed, but once he goes on his mission the story begins to pick up, with some good action scenes and moments of conflict.  Oddly enough, Flynn isn't much of a presence in this film, going through the motions more than acting.  Julie Bishop as his fiancee is hardly one of his best leading ladies, while Helmut Dantine as the Nazi leader is good in a role the actor had to play in many films throughout WWII.  I'm not sure where the movie was actually filmed, but a lot of it appears to have been on soundstages, which is unfortunate, since the tough, bitterly cold northern Canadian landscape would have added a dimension of reality to an otherwise unrealistic story.  Certainly, despite its shortcomings, the film is an interesting one to watch, but fans of Flynn will not count it among the best of his work at Warner Brothers.",Northern Pursuit VHS

The LAPD and FBI are the only thing keeping this movie from getting 5 stars from me. Seems like they could have done at least one thing right in the movie.About the Special Features: As usual, the added scenes contributed nothing (that's why they were cut in the first place). The editing workshop was a joke. You really only get to pick from a choice of 3 takes to build a preset sequence which lasts maybe a few seconds. I stupidly assumed that I would get to lay down audio tracks, build my own sequence, you know, editing.

They pointed out things I never noticed in the 20 times I've seen this movie.Overall, a great thriller.",N/A
119757,"THE BAND WAGON is a unique film which gently mocks the conventions of the ""backstage musical"" genre by piling stereotype upon stereotype to comic effect.  While some viewers see the film as purely cliche and dismiss it as such, those in tune with its covert satire often rank it as one of Hollywood's finest musicals.  But however you look at it, THE BAND WAGON offers two of Hollywood's greatest dancers, three memorable character actors, fabulous music, and some of the finest musical set pieces ever created for film.The story is slight but contains unexpected twists.  Fred Astaire is a has-been movie musical star (much of the film actually parodies his own history) who decides to return to Broadway--and unexpectedly finds himself trapped in a musical adaptation of Faust with a neurotic director (Jack Buchanan), two irate writers (Oscar Levant and Nanette Fabray) and a decidedly icy leading lady (Cyd Charisse.)  Needless to say, disaster follows disaster until every one concerned decides to junk the Faust element and do something purely entertaining instead.  As with most Vincent Minnelli films, THE BAND WAGON is visually stunning in virtually every manner possible, and the loose plot offers plenty of room for one dazzling musical number after another.  Astaire literally defies time with his work in this film and Charisse makes an exceptional partner; at the same time, Buchanan, Fabray, and Levant lend a touch of acid humor that adds considerably to the fun.The musical numbers are everything here, and they are all--including the disasterous Faust rehearsal--beautifully and memorably staged: the opening shoe shine number, the simple beauty of 'Dancing in the Dark,' the brief turns by Buchanan, Fabray and Levant are all charmers... and 'That's Entertainment' sums up the intent of the film.  Although some find it extremely slight, THE BAND WAGON remains one of the few truly great movie musicals of the 1950s--and easily one of the truly great movie musicals of Hollywood's golden age.

709513,"""Spirit: Stallion of the Cimarron"" breaks with tradition a bit by having its animal characters be less anthropomorphic in nature than is customary in most feature length animated films.  Indeed, except for an occasional voiceover on the part of the main character, the horses in this film never speak (only the human characters do).  In many ways, one respects this effort to keep the film more true to life, but the decision to take this approach ultimately ends up ruining the film for the adult audience (not being a five-year-old myself, I will not endeavor to say one way or the other how this film will play with that member of the audience).  For a film aimed at children, it is striking to discover just how humorless most of ""Spirit"" turns out to be.  There are no singing teakettles or furry little wiseacres to provide the comic relief we often need to get us through some of these films.  Without the wit that made ""Toy Story 2"" and ""Shrek"" as much fun for adults as they were for kids, ""Spirit"" leaves its adult audience high and dry, stuck with a story that is as old as the hills, with nothing but a few good action scenes to keep us from falling asleep.The problem is that, when the main character is essentially unable to communicate with anyone else directly - having to rely almost exclusively on soulful glances to convey all his emotions - the conflict and drama of the story tend to dry up.  And the conflict itself is so simplistic that one wonders if the filmmakers expect their audience ever to have seen a movie before (for many in its young audience, this may well be the case).  We're introduced to Spirit and the rest of his herd living free and undisturbed in the great Far West, when into the picture come the evil, dastardly white settlers who want only to corral the horses and use them as beasts of burden (I hate to quibble over historical realities here, but weren't horses extinct on the North American continent until the Europeans brought them back over?).  Of course, even though the whites are all uniformly brutish in their treatment of the horses, the Native Americans are portrayed as loving and respectful towards Spirit and his brethren and spiritually at one with them.  The PC meter runs dangerously high at times in this film.In terms of animation, ""Spirit"" has a certain elegance in its backgrounds and colors, and its action scenes are executed with a fine fluidity and flair.  The first fifteen minutes or so, before the arrival of the humans, offers promise that the film will take flight as a charming adventure tale.  When the men make their appearance, however, the movie becomes confined and static, with Spirit having to endure hardships, for what feels like ages, tied to a post.  After that, the film never recovers that sense of wide-ranging openness it has at the beginning.There isn't much else to say about ""Spirit,"" except, perhaps, to note that the Hans Zimmer score (crooned by the lugubrious Bryan Adams) is both maudlin and undistinguished.  ""Spirit: Stallion of the Cimarron"" may be fine for horse-loving children under the age of eight.  The rest of us, however, might prefer to find an animated film that engages both the mind and the funny bone and leave ""Spirit"" for the kiddies.",N/A
693861,"All the hype of Star Wars Episode One was a little too much for Star Wars. The originaltrilogy had basically filled the pot to the brim with water, leaving no more room for anymore.

Once you have hit the roof, the only wayto go higher is to smash through the roof. And that is what Attack Of The Clones did.Special Effects in every scene, dialogue and jokes that were too contrived, and a fewcharacters that were so thin, you blow them over with a Wookiee yell. The problem withgoing through the roof is you damage the building. That is what the new Star Warsprequels have done to Star Wars.Attack Of The Clones on the whole is not bad. It provides insight into Boba Fett's pastand we learn that his father was a great bounty hunter, we see the beginning of the CloneWars, and we begin to see Senator Palpatine's rise to power ... The special effects are alright, but most of them look terribly[unreal]. For all of the clone trooper scenes, I don't know why they don't just use pictures ofan actor in a clone trooper costume, shot in different positions, and use digital rotoscopingdo make one actor look like a spaceship-full of clone troopers. I think the matte paintingsof the originals were a lot more realistic looking, but I guess it is more expensive to dopaintings-on-glass matte paintings. Yoda looks so [unrea], and should have been made with alife-like robotic puppet that walks. I am pretty sure that is possible with our technologytoday. And C-3PO climbing along the front of a hover ship (in the droid factory) to keephimself from falling? That looks terrible! The color looks [unreal], and so do the movementsof his limbs. And quit wasting our time with unnecessary droid factory scenes. Instead, usethat time to show Palpatine turn into the Emperor. Also, watch the lightsaber fights in theoriginal and watch the ones in the prequels. The prequels will be a lot faster. But doesn'tfaster make it more dangerous? Sure, but with fast effects shots, you can't appreciate themand they just end up being dull.  The jokes in the movie are also terribly contrived. ThenThreepio says ""What a drag."" as his dis-connected head is dragged along by R2-D2, Ithought to myself, ""This is not Star Wars. This is not a Star Wars movie."" There is a wayto deliver a line of dialogue that is meant to be funny, in a funny way. Take Han Solo'sdialogue with a Death Star Officer over the comlink. After blasting his way into thedetention block, he is questioned by an Imperial Officer over the comlink. After Handesperately tries to make up a story for all the blasting that went on in the detention block,the officer gets suspicious. Han blasts the comlink and says, ""Boring conversationanyway."" It is absolutely hilarious, but what Harrison Ford did was he purposely didn'tpractice the lines so that it would seem sponataneous. That was what made it funny, andwhat makes it still funny. Also, our time is wasted with dialogue attempts to tie into theoriginals: ""I have a bad feeling about this"" , ""Be mindful of your feelings"". These do notsucceed in connecting to the sophistication of the originals, so they should be used less.The rest of Attack Of The Clones is un-inspired. There is no tension in the Clone Warbattle. There is no ""we better win the battle or else..."". In A New Hope, if the rebels didn'tdestroy the Death Star, their base planet would be annihilated. The beginning Coruscantchase is thrilling, and is about the only part of the movie I like. The love scenes areterrible, and the audience never feels any emotion during the scenes.",N/A
710759,"Simply one of the most powerful pieces of documentary filmmaking ever produced, ""9/11 - The Filmmakers' Commemorative Edition"" is a the story of a documentary that became an important piece of evidence in world history. Originally a documentary on a rookie New York City firefighter, two French brothers, G&eacute;d&eacute;on and Jules Naudet, spent several weeks with a local firehouse in lower Manhattan, filming a documentary of what it was like to become of New York's bravest. Little did they know that they were about to film not only one of the most evil acts of terrorism and cowardice the world has ever seen, but they captured the spirits, the strength, and the passion that united the world together as Americans for the first time.The Naudet brothers, who captured the moments of impact for both American Airlines flight #11 (a flight that was mentioned before in the film ""Two Guys and a Girl"" as a flight that brought the two female characters into the lives of a cowardly, cheating liar, hence bad news) and United Airlines flight 175 crashed into both towers of the World Trade Center. They also captured the final moments of many great heroes who lost their lives that day, not only firefighter such as the beloved Fire Department, Mychal Judge, but also the moments of desperation that led many to leap to their deaths rather than perish in a building bound to collapse (the sounds of bodies thumping in the background is extremely disturbing). The Naudet brothers deserved the utmost respect for their dedication and strength in capturing an important chapter of the history of this new century and millennium. While many might say that the French are anti-American, the Naudet brothers stood proud and tall, and supported their American brothers in their day of need.Originally airing on CBS, ""9/11 - The Filmmakers' Commemorative Edition"" is an important title not only to have in your library, but it should be viewed to remember those we lost on that tragic day and most importantly, the spirit of the free, democracy, non-fanatical world that united together to pray for a better future for our children. Moving, touching, nostalgic are the words I can think of when I saw this film. As a former employee who worked at the World Trade Center (65th floor of Tower 1) this tragedy hit me even more so because I was on my way to the towers later that morning.The end of innocence might have occurred that morning, however this film is just like the flag at Ft. McHenry during the War of 1812...not only our flag was still there, so was the spirit of countless individuals throughout the world.",N/A

569568,"This film by Hebert von Karajan is the best rendition of Verdi's ""Otello"" available in any video format. The conducting and singing are superb and the drama is expressed with the utmost intensity. Jon Vickers is the best Otello in recent memory, superior even to Placido Domingo in vocal and dramatic power. Mirella Freni is a bit light-voiced for Desdemona, but she sings beautifully and looks like an angel. Peter Glossop sings the role of Iago with beauty and power, and sets just the right tone of evil playfulness. Picture and sound quality are both just fine. The supporting cast is wonderful, too, and includes Jose van Dam (Lodovico) and Michel Senechal (Roderigo).Karajan's cinematography is not as polished as Zeffirelli's, but it does present the essentials of the drama honestly and straightforwardly. The Zeffirelli film, although it has an excellent cast and looks beautiful, is an abomination. Starting with a perfectly good soundtrack, Zeffirelli proceeded to destroy Verdi's dramatic and musical conception by cutting out little snippets of the score (seemingly almost at random) to bring his movie to a length of less than two hours. As far as I know, his film has never been issued on DVD. I hope nobody bothers with it. Karajan's film is more stagebound and the lip synch isn't perfect, but his version is complete and dramatically compelling.There are two other good renditions of this opera on DVD: a London (Royal Opera) performance with Placido Domingo, Kiri Te Kanawa, and Sergei Leiferkus and a 1958 RAI telecast with Mario del Monaco, Rosanna Carteri, and Renato Capecchi, conducted by Tullio Serafin. The London performance is beautifully played and sung, but it's dramatically less intense than Karajan's film. The Italian telecast is a wonderful historical document, but it is better to hear than it is to see. The monaural sound is good and the black and white picture is clear enough, but the singers don't always appear comfortable lip-synching to a prerecorded sound track. Nevertheless, I recommend that you get it for the remarkable performances of del Monaco and Capecchi. But if you're looking for the one best ""Otello"" video, Karajan's is it.",N/A

We usually never get that zombie that goes the extra mile, throwing its weight and obviously undead stature behind it. Well, with Lucio, the main characters simply aren't born under a lucky stars that birth dimwitted zombies. From the beginning of the movie, we find ourselves perched on the thresholds of flesh-eating and, by the end, we find ourselves totally immersed in it. It goes without saying that the portrayal of the zombies, from the ways they move when they hunger, to the effects, with many a throat ripe for the plucking, combine with an excellent storyline to balance out and keep the viewer's attention in one way or another.It goes without saying that this movie, with its wonderfully Lucio ending, is fun for the whole family to enjoy.

708046,"My boyfriend watched this DVD with a coworker while on break from his job one afternoon and was pleasantly surprised by just how good it was, so he bought it for me one night.  I have to say, it was awesome!  Stuart Townsend did a great job taking over the role of Lestat after Tom Cruise's stellar performance in Interview With The Vampire, and Vincent Perez was extremely good as Marius, Lestat's maker.  Marguerite Moreau turned in a wonderful performance as Jesse, the young Talamasca intern who discovers that her Aunt Maharet (Lena Olin) is actually a vampire who had borne a child before being made, and continued to watch over the descendants of her daughter down through the centuries, and Paul McGann was very good as David Talbot, Jesse's Talamasca mentor.My highest praise for this film goes to the late Aaliyah, who turned in a bravura performance as Akasha, the ""mother"" of all the vampires.  Aaliyah's Akasha was so wonderfully evil and decadent that for nights after watching QotD I found myself half-expecting her to leap out of the floor.  Had Aaliyah lived, I think she would have gone on to a wonderful career in movies, and I find it sad that she was taken from us so soon.  Rest in peace, girlfriend.",N/A
553404,"A landmark Doctor Who episode only because it involves an in-depth look at Gallifrey, and marks Leela's (Louise Jameson) departure.  Also worth a look if you're a Tom Baker fan --he gives one of his most intense performances as the Doctor.  Following the events of the previous season's superior ""The Deadly Assassin,"" the Doctor returns to his homeworld to claim the Presidency on a technicality.  What then transpires is enough to keep everyone in the dark as to his real motives --by the end of Part 2 we're wondering if that power-mad dictator really IS the Doctor!However, all of that aside, this episode is somewhat of a disappointment.  A six-part serial, it drags unbearably in some places, and breezes through the plot in others.  The Vardans are such an original idea on paper and in concept, but the way they are realized on screen is dreadful.  The Sontarans make a surprise entrance at the end of Part 4, but an entire squad of them is far less menacing than Kevin Lindsay's excellent solitary Sontaran of the earlier serials ""The Time Warrior"" or ""The Sontaran Experiment.""A pity, because some of the performances in this episode are worth a look --Milton Johns excels as a toady subservient Castellan  and John Arnatt plays the best incarnation of Borusa in the entire series; his mischevious side really shines through, and there's a distinct sense of understanding just where the Doctor may have gotten some of his own wry sense of humor.  The low points of the episode are, as usual, the endless corridors of Gallifrey and the even more endless corridors of the TARDIS itself (shot very unconvincingly on location in a gasworks, of all places).  My personal favorite is the unique design of the Doctor's Presidential office with its lead relief work.Sorry, folks.  Diehard Tom Baker-era Doctor Who fan here, but I have to call it as I see it: but for its pivotal position as a departing-companion episode, ""The Invasion of Time"" is not worth owning.

589641,"Sometimes there are reasons why, either reality-based ones or cosmic, certain things do not happen when we want them to. Martin Scorsese has had the Dream of turning the novel, ""Gangs of New York"" into a film for over 25 years; yet only this week has his dream come to fruition with the opening of the film. But was the result worth the wait?Scorsese's ""Gangs of New York"" is big, bold and bloody: beautifully shot and designed to reveal a world that none of us have any notion about: 1846 and 1863 New York City with the last time period played out against the backdrop of the Civil War.Scorsese narrows in on the friction between the ""born-heres"" led by Bill the Butcher (Daniel Day Lewis) and the immigrants: mostly Irish, freed slaves, Italians, etc. Leonardo Di Caprio plays an Irishman, Amsterdam Vallon who, as a child, witnesses the death of his father (Liam Neeson) at the hands of Bill the Butcher. Revenge then becomes the driving force of Amsterdam's life and thus the main thrust of the film itself. Oddly enough Bill takes a shine to Amsterdam and takes him under his wing and thereby making of Amsterdam his Brutus to his Caesar.One of the most interesting sections of the film are those involved with the history of NYC: as in the arrival of the Irish immigrants, after the potato famine in Ireland, who were immediately made citizens just outside the ship they had arrived on so that they would be required to immediately join the Northern Forces and be shipped off to the war in the South without having spent more than an hour or two in New York City! As one of the new recruits says as he boards the ship to take him to the South: ""I wonder when they are gonna feed us."" (This being the most important thing to him at the moment and not that he is off to fight for a country he knows absolutely nothing about)  Needless to say, most of these young men never made it back to NYC.""Gangs of New York"" seldom soars, though and could certainly be trimmed of at least 15 minutes. What is surprising about this film is that one would think that this subject matter would be the perfect vehicle for Scorsese's vision of America: you get ahead not only by working hard but by working the angles. Think ""GoodFellas"" or ""Raging Bull."" On the other hand, the genteel world of Edith Wharton's NYC of the very early 20th Century (some 40 years after the world of Bill the Butcher) would not seem to fit into the Scorsese scheme of things but his film version of the novel is not only gorgeous to the eye but touches the heart and the mind as well.Daniel Day Lewis is a spellbinding performer and his Bill the Butcher is something to see: tall, gawky, mean as a skinned cat, clever and suspicious. Day-Lewis transforms himself into this character, inhabits his soul and his being like almost no other actor can. DiCaprio is not yet as fine an actor as Day Lewis is, but his Amsterdam is his first adult performance and he handles it well.Any Scorsese film is worth seeing as he is truly a visionary and master craftsman but in his wait to film ""The Gangs of New York"" he seems to have lost interest in it. It's as if, once the dream was realized, he had outgrown it.",N/A
330743,"The Road Runner and Wile E. Coyote Looney Tunes, in my opinion, are the best cartoons ever made. THE CLASSIC CHASE includes my favorites of all of them.

689927,"... possibly too much to absorb.I'm so glad that Richard Linklater made THIS movie.  I think it's akin to something Kubrick might have tried if he were a young film-maker today (not that it's all that Kubrickian, but it's such a bold undertaking in terms of ideas and technology , it's similar to the experimental advances forged with &quot;2001&quot;).  I also think this will prove a benchmark movie, 20 years from now, when we can re-examine the point in cinematic history when digital methods became more widespread -- &quot;Waking Life&quot; is a bit like a metaphysical &quot;Steamboat Willie&quot; in that sense.And the ideas the film addresses are truly interesting.  A lot of critics have rapped on it for sounding like a lot of stoned, 'college student navel gazing,' but they're just jaded.  College is generally the last time most of us have a chance to talk and think in philosophical terms.  In a world where most of us are locked into thinking about our jobs or our daily concerns 24/7, what's wrong with listening to characters talking about slightly more esoteric ideas and concepts?  In that respect, &quot;Waking Life&quot; ALMOST makes up for Linklater's other movie this year, the heavy-handed and aggressively knuckleheaded &quot;Tape.&quot;Plus, this is a beautiful movie.  The animation is basic but sly and expressive, the colors are rich, and it's neat to see cinematography subjected to animation -- the film is worth watching just to see the way the artists play with light they're animating over.But having said all that, the film may be too much.  You're trying to watch and keep track of the images (which are busy and constantly changing), you're trying to absorb and process complicated dialogue on top of complicated dialogue, and you're also trying to just keep it all straight.  Basically, this is a movie that REQUIRES repeat viewings and yet... something about its basic density also discourages repeat viewings.  I watched &quot;Waking Life&quot; two days ago and enjoyed it... but I can't say I'm in a big hurry to rewind it and start all over again.Perhaps this will be a movie that grows on me more over time, perhaps it'll be a film that I watch once a year and get something new from gradually.  &quot;Slacker&quot; certainly is, but &quot;Slacker&quot; also has a flesh-and-blood immediacy and a sense of fun to it that &quot;Waking Life,&quot; due to its own innovation, simply doesn't exude.  Nevertheless, love it or hate it, this is a movie that will be discussed and referenced well into the future.(Just a note: this year, the Academy finally created an award for animated features; &quot;Waking Life&quot; was not nominated in that category; &quot;Jimmy Neutron: Boy Genius&quot; was.

59613,"Based upon the Fannie Hurst novel of the same name, this 1934 film starring Claudette Colbert and Louise Deavers is a terrific, well acted, sentimental melodrama that should be viewed with a caveat. It is so politically incorrect as to be nearly astounding. It reflects a paternalistic view of African-Americans that was reflective of the time in which this film was written. It is certainly is a view that is jarring in these more enlightened times, as it reflects the nature of the racism that was inherent in our society at that time. Notwithstanding this, it is still a terrific film that was deservedly nominated for an Academy Award for Best Picture.Claudette Colbert plays the role of Bea, a struggling widow with a young daughter. Louise Deavers plays the part of Delilah, Bea's African-American housekeeper. She, too, has a young daughter. Both women are struggling to survive. Delilah, however, has a pancake recipe that is out of this world. Bea, upon tasting it, decides to market it in hopes of making their fortune. Delilah agrees to this.Before you know it, they are raking in a fortune with Delilah's pancake mix. Bea offers Delilah a  cut of the business which offer Delilah declines, preferring to remain with Bea, living with her and waiting on her, always the perennial mammy.(See what I mean!) While Bea always treats Delilah with affection and care, there is not a level playing field between the two. Bea lives upstairs in their palatial mansion, while Delilah is relegated to her basement room, comforted by her stalwart belief in God.Meanwhile, the years have passed and Delilah's light skinned daughter, Peola (Fredi Washington), clearly knows the score.  She certainly has no intention of being anyone's mammy and wants to pass for white, as she does not wish to be relegated to second class citizenry. She does not try to do this because she wants to be white, but rather, she wants the advantages associated with  being white in that time. Hers is not a decision based upon race self hate, but upon a realistic assessment of how she could be all she could be. Still, she breaks Delilah's heart by doing this and when Delilah dies, ostensibly of a broken heart, replete with Negro spirituals in the background, Peola repentently breaks down.All in all, this is a mesmerizing film, both cinematically and historically, as it is a reflection of another time in which racial conflict was viewed in such a paternalistic way. Claudette Colbert, Louise Deavers, and Fredi Washington all give moving, compelling performances, nothwithstanding the political incorrectness of the script. This sentimental tearjerker is a definite must see by those who enjoy first rate melodramas and those who simply love vintage films.",N/A

531054,"Requiem for a Dream was one of the most critically acclaimed movies of 2000 and deservedly so. Naturally, reviewers' favorites and those of audiences are often not the same ones. Many viewers will find this look at the effects of drug abuse on four New Yorkers too strong and horrifying. Not too many people got the chance to see the film in its theatrical run, as it was released without a rating, rather than be tagged with the MPAA's dreaded 'NC-17'. New Line is offering an 'R' rated version on video. You can't fight Blockbuster.Sara Goldfarb [Ellen Burstyn] is a widow living in a low-rent high-rise apartment near Coney Island in New York City. She keeps her beloved television, which is about all the company she has, chained to a radiator. Harry [Jared Leto] is a sweet, rather passive guy who is also a junkie. He steals her TV on a regular basis and hocks it for drug money. It's a pathetic game they play, for he always takes it to the same place and she always goes and gets it. As is sadly typical in most families, they never discuss Harry's drug problem, which he shares with his girlfriend, Marianne [Jennifer Connelly], and his best friend, Tyrone [Marlon Wynans]. Sara has addictions of her own. Chocolate is one. A strange game show is another. One day she gets a phone call. The caller claims she is to be a contestant on the show. She is unable to get into her favorite dress, which she hasn't worn in twenty years. At the suggestion of a friend, she goes to a diet doctor who puts her on pills. Soon she is as addicted as her son. The rest of the movie shows the harrowing decline of the characters.Director Darren Aronofsky jazzes up this all too gritty story with some of the most original visuals you can imagine. This is all done with dazzling camera work and very few special effects. He also enhances the picture with a clever, detailed soundtrack. He wisely observes his characters objectively and never sinks into banal moralizing. He makes few anti-drug statements. His theme is the nature of obsessive-compulsive behavior.The cast is marvelous. Burstyn was nominated for an Oscar, and, if there were justice in Hollywood, she would have won. Leto and Connelly are two of our best character actors, and Requiem for a Dream is another entry in their impressive and ever growing resumes.The story is contemporary but hardly new. It is based on a novel by Hubert Selby, Jr. that was published in 1978, before America's costly and ineffective war on drugs even began.",Requiem for a Dream - Director's Cut

It has alot of creativity and underlying emotions that can be seen by exceptional acting. This movie shows how it might feel to go through a separation from someone you have known and loved for a long time. It isn't just an easy thing and this movie points that out. Each partner grieves and gets angry and bargains, just like when you are dealing with death. The cinematography is quite nice. The relationship the children have with their parents is original, and highly entertaining, especially how they interact with Keaton. The house they live in is so cozy and warm, I wish I lived in it. The ending really hits home and leaves you wondering if she will forgive him? I guess the viewer gets to answer the question.

Following the journey of American Pulp Writer Holly Martins(Joseph Cotton) to Vienna soon after WWII in search of his old school chum Harry Lime(Orson Welles) who has offered him a job. To reveal much more of the plot would be a crime, but what follows is an engaging, dark mystery that takes Martins to the heart of blackmarket Vienna, which provides a beautiful backdrop of a wrecked European city. To tell a little, it seems at first that Lime has been killed in a car accident, but martins learns more about the dark side of his friend and the truth of his dissapearance as the story goes on.The film's score, by Anton Karas on the Zither, is haunting and memorable. The crass producers of ""xXx"" even use it in their disasterous film. British director Carol Reed carefully crafts his story and his direction and use of light, dark, the city, and it's sewers creates a claustrophobic atmosphere that few films can match. It is easy to see why this is considered the greatest British film of the 20th century. This is a must own for any serious DVD collector.

289935,"By the end of the 6th season of Dr. Who, the format of the series was getting pretty stale, so the writers used a brief hatus that the series was placed in [brought on by a writer's strike] to revamp the concept. Originally, they were going to make Dr. Who more like James Bond, but realizing that that would make the series TOO adult oriented, decided to go along with another concept. No matter what concept they were going to use, he was going to be trapped on Earth, so in a concept that would later become one of the key elements in &quot;The X-Files&quot; they watered down the &quot;Bond&quot; concept, had him working in conjunction with an underground government agency known as &quot;U.N.I.T.&quot; and had him go after creatures and such that no other agency could handle.While this concept lasted for only a couple of seasons, it allowed them to revamp old aliens like the Daleks and Cybermen and introduce new aliens like the Autons, the Master and so much more.In this first new format episode, the Doctor was forced into a regeneratrion by the Timelords and forced to live out a part of his life on Earth. He is teamed with two new companions Liz Shaw (Caroline Johnson) and Brigadier Lethbridge-Stewart (Nicholas Courtney) who has an entire team of men under his command.The Doctor's (now played by Jon Pertwee) first task is to investigate the appearance of these strange meteors, but first he must remember who he is, let alone what these faceless men who are soon to be wandering the streets of London are. . ..As a special treat, informative text about the program is shown (an option which could be turned on and off), and a commentery voice-over done by Courtney and Johnson.Even if you already have a VHS copy of this episode in your library, I highly suggest that you get this copy as well.",N/A
294288,"Although the film was a ostensibly a 20th Century Fox production, THE MAN WHO NEVER WAS was filmed in England using primarily English crew and cast (though American leads).  It belongs to a tradition of English war films in which aspects of the war are treated slowly, deliberately, and with great precision.  While in the US war films tended to feature John Wayne leading Marines into combat, the British tended to focus much more on the preparation and plans of operations.  For instance, the very fine film THE DAM BUSTERS features very little in the way of actual combat.  And THE MAN WHO NEVER WAY has no combat whatsoever.The movie is based on a book by the same name about Operation Mincemeat, in which the British attempted to mislead the Germans about the intended invasion spot for D-Day by planting a corpse with fake papers on a beach in Spain, knowing that the Spanish would pass the papers onto the Germans.  The entire movie is involved with the formation of the plan, and then creating the man who never was, creating his papers and personal effects.  On one level, not much happens in the film, but on another it is one of the most fascinating films ever made about the war, because of the practical problems they deal with in the executing of the operation.  Knowing that it was all based upon real events greatly adds to the appeal of the film.Clifton Webb, who was in fact far too old for the part, turns in a convincing performance as Lieutenant Commander Montagu.  In most of his films he comes across as arrogant, but in this one he instead communicates competence and intelligence.  Gloria Grahame is excellent as the primary female presence in the film.  If you look carefully, you can spot Stephen Boyd in a small role, a few years before he would portray Messala in BEH-HUR.",Man Who Never Was VHS
687811,"Bandits is a goofy, yet solidly entertaining film.  Bruce Willis and Billy Bob Thornton brilliantly play off each other, making the humor in the film seem, for the most part, believable.  The movie, however, does slow down and lose some of its charm when Kate Blanchett enters the picture.  While her character is at first interesting, the love triangle that develops between her and our intrepid bandits seems hollow and forced.I definitely recommend this as a rental if you're not sure what to expect.",Bandits
286104,"No one doubts that THEY DIED WITH THEIR BOOTS ON with Errol Flynn is a terrific film.  It is the last movie that Flynn shares with Olivia de Havilland, and their chemistry shared over a long film marriage is touching and palpable.  Flynn's interpretation was to play Custer as a western version of his own hell-raising self, and he dominates each scene in which he appears.  He is alternately heroic, funny, sarcastic, haughty, and sacriligious.  His co-stars very capably allow Flynn to bounce off them.  Against Crazy Horse (Anthony Quinn), Flynn is solemn and candid.  Against General Winfield Scott (Sidney Greenstreet), he is properly subservient. Against his Indian hating subordinate officer played by Arthur Kennedy, he is full of righteous fury.  The climactic battle at the Little Big Horn is a paean to self-sacrifice and honor.  The film does not go wrong internally.  Its fault, if one can call it that, is that it bears no relation to historical truth.  Every major incident in the film from Custer's days in West Point, to his conduct under battle, to his relationship to his wife, and to his role in the annihilation of him and his troopers at the Little Big Horn are either grossly exaggerated or outrageous lies.  Especially disturbing is the movie's suggestion that Custer sacrificed the lives of the men under his command as a means of political expedience.  The literal truth was Custer and all his 7th Cavalry were slaughtered only because of his obstinancy in not believing the reports of his Indian guides.To pass judgment on TDWTBO is to walk a shaky line between lauding a shiny object without questioning too deeply about what makes that object shine.  Perhaps a needed corrective would be a disclaimer in the closing credits that what you see is not necessarily what you get.  Sort of like life.",N/A
716959,"This movie adaptation of Father Girzone's book wonderfully compells the viewer to sit back and be fascinated by a modern day Christ story.Joshua, an artist and woodcarver, drifts into a small town and within days turns a disjointed group of citizens into a community of good neighbors.  Joshua's manner is straightforward, kind, yet fun and amusing---just the kind of guy you'd want at your next get-together.  He doesn't preach---he simply is---his love and selflessness runs out from him like cool fresh water to the thirsty.  His actions are transforming---but alas, they also cause trouble.  The pastor of the local church is frightened by Joshua's charisma and he does his worst to disassemble the band of neighbors by attempting to blacken Joshua's name.The movie is not as complicated as the novel, the scenes where Joshua is asked to speak at the nearby Jewish Synagogue are completely eliminated as is Girzone's hopeful message of all roads--all houses of worship--leading to the same goal rather than insisting that their way is the only way.  The dialogue at times can be a little too persuasive in attempting to disclose the true nature of Joshua--which the audience identifies correctly from the start anyway.I was disappointed that more attention was not paid to Joshua's exquisite carvings----only one of the statues of Peter is manifested here.Of note is F. Murray Abraham's portrayal of the threatened pastor and lovely sad-eyed Giancarlo Giannini as the Pope.Recommended to all who enjoy or need a spiritual kick in the head.",N/A
698547,"We are now entering a great age of movie making.  Computer-generated special effects have become so accessible that even European Cinema can afford them.  Since the good people in Hollywood can't write a decent script to save their lives, and can not imagine a use for CGI other than blowing things up, we must now look elsewhere for our films.  Amelie is just a fun movie - a sweet romantic comedy from beginning to end.  In this film, the special effects act as surreal compliments to the story - more Jean Cocteau than Jerry Bruckheimer.  In the scene where Amelie gets her heart broken, she simply melts into water.  The story, such as it is, basically concerns her fear of meeting the man she has a crush on from afar...or maybe it's about the things a woman does to amuse herself if she's never had a fulfilling sexual encounter?  (How many couples ARE having sex right now?  Only 15?)  It's not really about the plot - it's simply a fun, good-hearted adventure with a lot of quirky people.",Amelie
475525,"It took me two viewings to fully appreciate the beginning of the most famous trilogy created.  The movie had an enormous build-up and no movie could fully live up to the hype, but it just was not a great movie as the other three were.  The look of the movie was absolutely spectacular with full digital worlds that looked incredibly real and lifelike.  However, the same could not be said for the characters.  They are as flat and dull and seem to be inserted to let Lucas expand his digi-lands.  THe dialogue is sparse and uninteresting and there isn't the same feel as the other movies.  For many fans, the first three movies had a &quot;magical&quot; feel as we followed the story.  This movie didn't seem to have any magic or warmth like the others.  I think the tech-heavy feel of this movie had something to do with it.  Many will disagree, but I thought the kid who played Annakin was perfect and was one of the bright spots of the movie.  Liam Neeson and Ewan McGregor were fine but were given extremely little to work with.  The dialogue in the movie was rather dull and uninteresting unlike the vivid images and breathtaking special effects.  As one reviewer said, this movie was just an introduction to all the characters thus, the plodding pace of the movie.  However, if this would have been the beginning to the Star Wars saga, it would be a blip on the movie map, instead of a major destination.",N/A

179052,"""Double Indemnity"" was the 1944 film noir classic from director Billy Wilder that finally explained how insurance worked to millions of Americans.  For those who fondly remember Fred MacMurray from ""My Three Sons"" on TV and all those Disney movies, seeing him play Walter Neff, being bent around the little finger of Phyllis Dietrichson (Barbara Stanwyck, as one of the all time great psycho-babes) is a bit of a shock.  Throw into the mix the fact that Edward R. Robinson plays the ""good"" guy in the story and no wonder audiences feel they have stepped through the looking glass.The story is simple.  Neff is a smooth talking insurance salesman who more than meets his match in the seductive Mrs. Dietrichson.  Neff just wants to renew her husband's automobile insurance, but the sparks between them are too much to ignore and the next thing he knows not only is he having an affair, but the have come up a plan to murder her husband (Tom Powers) for his life insurance money.  Even better, the policy has a double indemnity clause.  But the course of true love never goes smoothly, especially when you throw murder into the mix.""Double Idemnity"" was remade for television in 1973 with Richard Crenna, Samantha Eggar and Lee J. Cobb, which was actually an above average remake as such things go.  However, the original has a gritty feel that has to be experienced.  Be warned: you will never want to buy insurance ever again.Great Film Noir Lines: (1) ""I never knew that murder could smell like honeysuckle""; (2) ""They've commited a murder and it's not like taking a trolly ride together where they can get off at different stops. They're stuck with each other and they've got to ride all the way to the end of the line and it's a one-way trip and the last stop is the cemetery""; (3) ""Suddenly it came over me that everything would go wrong. It sounds crazy, Keyes, but it's true, so help me. I couldn't hear my own footsteps. It was the walk of a dead man.""  Why are these lines so great?  Well, take a novel by James M. Cain and then have director Billy Wilder and author Raymond Chandler do the script.If you like ""Double Indemnity"" then check out these other films on AFI's list of 100 Greatest Love stories: #49 ""The Postman Always Rings Twice"" (1946 version) and #94 ""Body Heat"" (like the inverse on the ranks there?).

590339,"John Travolta gets a chance to be the hero in this formula thriller.  And, to his credit, he does a wonderful job portraying the divorced father who is faced with the impossible: either believe an incredulous story from his frequently prevacating son, or trust the &quot;authorities&quot; and their assertion that nothing his son has claimed occurred.Fortunately for the audience, Travolta decides to go with his son on this one.  However, the movie tends down a standard path in the process of uncovering the truth about his son's new stepfather.  There are also some considerable leaps in deductive logic, and a few too many perfectly arranged situations that lead to a rather predictable conclusion.  One of the most annoying aspects of the film is how inept the local police department appears to be in gathering evidence.  I realize the events in the film take place in a small coastal town on the Eastern Seaboard, but they can't be so backward that they don't even have a connection to the internet.Casting for this feature is outstanding.  Matthew O'Leary, as Travolta's son, is fantastic in his ability to play the classic child of a divorced family.  Vince Vaughn is able to capture that creepiness of the individual who has more to show than meets the eye.  Teri Polo, as Travolta's ex-wife, brings believability to her character's desire to see what she wants in her new husband, and ignore the obvious warning signs.If you are looking for a pure escape movie, this is the one.  Pop up some popcorn and enjoy the show.  But you'll probably see the ending coming long before the characters on the screen do.",N/A
676661,"'Moulin Rouge!' is perhaps one of the years best films for a number of reasons. The first is that finally someone had the guts to remake the musical for a post-millenium audience. The post-modern eclecticism of the film may be off-putting to many, but those who can see past the amazing costume, wild music and often disorientating cutting will love the film.We're in Paris at the turn of the century; the Bohemian revolution is taking the world by storm. We meet our young, heart strong protagonist Christian (Ewan McGregor) crying over his lost love. But wait! Hello now we're inside the Moulin Rouge, a nightclub where the rich and powerful mingle with the dark and beautiful. And everyone seems to be doing the 'Can-can' to Nirvana's 'Smells like teen spirit'... sound confusing? Well it is, and for good reason.The film is essentially a love story, two star crossed lovers who are forced together by inextricable circumstances. This is coupled with Christian's efforts to win the heart of the sparkling diamond Satine (Nicole Kidman) however they must overcome an obstacle in order for their love to be recognized, and that is the Duke (Richard Roxbourgh). The film is a tragedy like many musical endings but the film's director Baz Luhrman has completely subverted the genre by adding a postmodern element.Through using pop culture and mass marketing Luhrman makes a strong point about the problems with it. Thus the film is imbued with elements of Bollywood through the Hindi dance in `Spectacular, spectacular' this splicing of styles allows Luhrman to convey much more meaning than if he had directed `Moulin Rouge' as a straight modern musical.20th century Fox has truly gone to town in presenting this amazing DVD. The number of commentary tracks as well as the green fairy version of the film (much like the White rabbit presentation on the Matrix DVD) is enough to make the fans drool. However it is in the second disc where some of the most in depth features available on any DVD can be found. Interviews with cast, crew, featurettes galore, and a host of Easter eggs truly make this DVD a benchmark of what we can hope DVD's will be realized as in the future.The transfer is flawless onto the DVD format. The crystal clear picture is the best way to look at the vibrant, elaborate costumes and the Dolby Digital 5.1 soundtrack is utterly amazing and makes the viewer feel like they are part of the film.Overall `Moulin Rouge' is a sumptuous feast of vibrant color, elaborate set and opulent costume. It really has to be seen to be believed and is one of those films that if you haven't seen, needs to be seen for nothing more than pure spectacle.",N/A

On the plus side, The Musketeer has some nice looking sets and some well lit scenes. On the negative side, the lead actor is awful, the script trite and humorless, the whole presentation is just bland and unengaging. I didn't even like Tim Roth, who is just too sickeningly evil and even HE can't bring the part to life. Worst of all was the action choreography and editing. The fighting was so poorly staged and cut that I had to go back 2 or 3 times just to figure out what happened. Did anybody storyboard this stuff out?

399681,"After John Woo's move to Hollywood, things got a little bit shaky for a while with this John Travolta/Christian Slater action flick. And while the action is good, the story feels like it was taken from a pile marked &quot;unused Steven Seagal ideas&quot;. That said, Travolta is effortlessly cool, slowly making his way back to the top with films like Pulp Fiction after the slump of the 80's. Woo's flair for impressive action and stunts is evident, as Slater is out to try to stop Travolta from detonating a stolen missile (hence the film's title).We're in familiar territory, but it's a Woo movie, so the action is thankfully better than the average action flick. Samantha Mathis is the love interest for Slater's character, but she's as cardboard as they come, the plot is rather brainless and some unconvincing techno-jargon ruins the film's credibility. But the action saves the film, with the ever-present things exploding and helicopter chases making this one a solid, if not always-realistic action flick.",N/A

Of course the movie would have been even better with a bigger budget for a stronger cast, yet I find it all in all enjoyable.There's nothing quite new with the plot (""The Replacement Killers"" and ""The Bourne Identity"" being two best in this genre lately) but it still manages to keep you guessing at least half way through. Skeet Ulrich is Kevin Burke, a rising star in an international bank in Rotterdam, working as security agent under his surrogate father and mentor, bank director Karl Jorgensen (Derek de Lint). Just when Kevin prepares to propose to a broker he's deeply in love with, the beautiful Rosalind Bremmond (Katherine Lang), her life is cut short by an assassin's bullet. As Kevin is furiously driven to seek revenge, his investigation into Rosalind's death not only reveals a dark facet of her life, it also drags him into a web of corporate espionage and assassination involving some agents from Interpol and numerous unidentified enemies. While working his way out of this dangerous maze, Kevin confronts with another mysterious beauty, Tessa Jansen (Kristy Swanson), who might well give him the ultimate answer to his deadliest question...Conclusion: 4 stars, 1 to the cast (especially Derek de Lint), and 3 to the film makers in terms of editing and cinematography (some sexy scenes from the streets of Rotterdam are really worth checking out). One side note: I was a little bit curious about ""some sexuality"" under the R rating box. Turned out it didn't involve Kristy Swanson, just Katherine Lang. But it was good anyway.",Soul Assassin

152982,"Jeffrey (Christopher Ashley, 1995)What a wonderful little film this is, easily one of the best releases of 1995. Unfortunately, it went almost  unnoticed by everyone but a few stray critics and some hardcore Trekkies who were able to withstand the traumatization of witnessing Jean-Luc Picard running around behaving like a  flaming queen. (One can easily imagine Patrick Stewart imitating Alan Rickman's immortal one-liner from Galaxy Quest: ""I played Richard III..."")Jeffrey is a love story gone horribly awry in the best of ways. A young gay man named Jeffrey (Steven Weber,  probably best-known for taking on the role of Jack Torrance in the recent miniseries adaptation of Stephen King's The Shining), obsessed with the spread of HIV, swears off sex,  much to the horror of his best friend Sterling (Stewart). Needless to say, as soon as he decides this, he meets Mr. Right, a chap named Steven (Michael T. Weiss before his  Pretender days). As we go through boy-meets-boy, boy-loses-boy, boy-gets-boy-into-pickle, boy-gets-pickle-into-boy, we're treated to a number of sideshows in Jeffrey  and Steve's fantasy lives (some of which are positively horrific; Jeffrey's imagining of how a phone conversation with his parents might go is the kind of thing recurring nightmares  are made of), a twisted self-help guru (Sigourney Weaver) who tries to get Jeffrey over his fear of intimacy, some sidebars with Sterling and Sterling's AIDS-infected lover  (the deliciously funny Bryan Batt), and various other pratfalls. The end result is hysterical in all the right places.What struck the few people who noticed the film back in 1995 was the transplanting of the typical Hollywood  slapstick-romance-forties-comedy framework onto a gay relationship; these days that's common enough we can forget about that angle. Today we look at it and are astounded  at the number of bit players in this film who have gone on to stardom; Stewart and Weaver were the only really big names in the cast at the time, but since then Weiss,  Camryn Manheim, Kathy Najimy, Ethan Phillips, and a host of others have all become recognizable faces. Either the casting director was a genius or the movie was simply a  secretarial pool from which every major Hollywood agent has since drawn. Either way, it's a great film to play spot-the future-star with, in addition to its many other fine  qualities.Very, very highly recommended in every way, shape, and form. **** ",N/A

589883,"Not many period movies can successfully capture the spirit and flavor of an age. Director Frank Darabont has done so in THE MAJESTIC. What Darabont has done was to capture the spirit of an age that never truly existed on the American scene. His slice of life is a odd mixing of the innocence of small town life from LEAVE IT TO BEAVER with the more gritty politicizing of a country torn by the unfounded accusations of the House UnAmerican Activities Committee. This mixing is not a bad thing either. It takes guts and skill for any director to make two movies in one, and there will always be critics who repudiate any such attempt. But there is no inherent flaw within the attempt. Judging such a movie is no more difficult than judging any movie. Did it combine the disparate parts in such a way as to make the attempt pleasing? This movie stands as a model for future directors to emulate should they decide something similar.Jim Carrey plays Peter Appleton, a successful movie lover and script writer who, in his college days, had the misfortune to join a club to impress a girl, only to find out years later that some communists joined as well. When his membership becomes known, he is blacklisted from working again. At this point, the movie is on target to address the issues that other and similar films as Woody Allen's THE FRONT did. These issues dealt with whether it was morally and legally justifiable to condemn people based only on their alleged membership in organizations that may or may not have included communists. In the real world, the reputations and lives of hundreds of innocent Americans were ripped apart based only the the rabid accusations of the then politically correct witch hunters who saw communists at all levels of American society. THE MAJESTIC could have focused tightly on that but director Darabont placed Carrey in a car accident which robbed him of his memory so that he had to seek a new life in a small town. Darabont's vision of small town American life was taken not from real life but from other movies about small towns. Carrey's adopted town, called Lawson, was full of kind people only too willing to help a stranger. Of course, there is the inevitable romantic complication between a girl and the man that she and the rest of the town assume is the same man who went off to war ten years ago only to die. Carrey returns as that man. I had only a little trouble accepting that the resemblance between Peter Appleton and the dead war hero Luke Trimble was so close as to fool nearly everyone. When Appleton enters town as an amnesiac, the movie changes focus, not the abrupt about turn of suddenly reversing direction on a one way street, but rather that of merely changing lanes on a three lane highway. It is interesting that Carrey plays Appleton-Luke as one who really might be the revived hero. As Luke, Carrey restores not only the dilapidated Majestic theater to its former glory, but also the shattered collective soul of the town that now can welcome back the return of one of its lost sons to the war. Of course, his former identity is revealed by the slimy representatives of the film industry who want to send Appleton's pinko rear end to jail. As Appleton goes on national television while being forced to read a prepared statement implicating himself as a communist, director Darabont borrows from Frank Capra to allow Appleton to clear his good name by quoting from the Bill of Rights. Other critics of this movie find a great deal of fault with such obvious use of other directors' works, but the problem does not lie in the genesis of Appleton's impassioned speech defending the constitution, but rather in assessing its impact on the film, and by implication, on the audience. Do all the various parts to an admittedly many sided movie work? Frankly not all, but most do. I had a more difficult time accepting the abrupt about face of the town in cheering en masse their hero at the end when just before they abandoned him. But perhaps this collective about face is the point of the movie. If Jimmy Stewart or Jim Carrey can argue passionately about the rights of all Americans to speak their minds, then maybe those who did not think so at the beginning of the film, will change their mind at the end.",N/A

Tilda Swinton, the star and focus of this film, is perfect in the role of a woman trying to protect her family from tragedy while maintaining her daily routine.A brief summary: Her adolescent son has been piecked up by a manipulative man and then the man tries to blackmail the boy's mother for money. Afterwards, he dies in cirucmstances that make the boy a possible suspect - although he is, in fact, innocent (I'm not giving anything away here; all of this is revealed early on in the movie).Swinton is calmly focused (most of the time), single-mindedly determined in her quest to hold everything together in the face of nearly insurmountable odds. She is equally determined to make sure her family - son, 2 daughter, elderly father-in-law - aren't aware of what is going on, of the tragedy that took place within minutes of their front doorstep. Meanwhile, her life is changing but not in ways she could have foreseen. In spite of her best efforts, she can't control everything.Watching Swinton juggle all her everyday duties (cooking, cleaning, keeping the kids organized and on time for school and after school activities) while dealing with the burden of hiding a body, covering up the evidence and keeping everyone in the dark, I couldn't help marveling at her apparent selflessness in the face of so much and at her incredible ability to fool those around her.This movie is one of the best of the year. Don't be so swept up by the story,however, that you miss the visual details that are breath-takingly poetic in beauty and intensity. The lingering shots of Swinton's face, the color of the water, the way a drop falling from the kitchen faucet (framing a face in the drop) can punctuate the mood of the moment.",N/A

She displays a depth, softness and vulnerability previously unseen in her. You will enjoy spending time with these characters. Allison Janney as Nina's sister, and Steve Zahn as George's brother, are especially fun.A standout moment is when Paul Rudd and Jennifer Aniston dance at his brother's wedding. Broadway star Audra McDonald sings a sensational version of &quot;You Were Meant for Me&quot; with the band.  The couple takes the spotlight on the dance floor with the moves they learned at Madame Reynolds' dance class. New York is beautifully and lovingly filmed throughout this movie. Very well done.

687508,"The majority of METROPOLIS is visually stimulating, with rich backgrounds (for the most part) on the level of Geoff Darrow's HARD BOILED. Computer generated imagery appears with hit and miss success, as some scenes seem terribly rushed and out of place. Some 2D/3D combos, particularly during the climax, are poorly designed. But for every clumsy scene, there's another which is highly inspired. The screen graphics during Tima's cyber search through the phone lines are riddled with interesting goodies. Very cool.The story is familiar dystopian human versus technology, and reminded me a lot of MISTER X (and TERMINAL CITY). But I generally like that sort of thing. Without ruining anything, I found the climax to be the slowest, most boring part of the film (I kept looking at the clock, wondering when something was going to happen), but when it does...the final conflict and the use of  &quot;Ray&quot; is truly superb. Unfortunately, this is quickly followed by a weak resolution, but I'll take my gems where I can find them.At it's best, METROPOLIS is a beautiful feast for the eyes, beaming with high design and style. At it's worst, it bears clumsy imagery and animation reminiscent of Bakshi, of all monsters.Definitely worth renting.",N/A

701177,"Jodie Foster is awesome in this film. She is such a talented actress & in this film she played a tough woman who didn't give into her attackers. This film follows Jodie portraying a woman who has a daughter & her ex-husband helps her buy this really expensive house with this panic room. On their first night there, three guys break in looking for '3 million' dollars which is located in the panic room. Unfortunately Jodie sees them on the camers in the panic room when she goes to turn everything off in their and stuff, so she runs and gets her daughter, & they run and get in the panic room. Now since they r in it, the robbers can't get in it. So over intercom Jodie tells them to 'get out of my house' & they tell her why they're there. Jodie and her daughter refuse to ever come out. Unfortunately they try putting gas in there to scare them out, so Jodie lights a lighter & blows the gas up into the gascontainer & the guys get hurt instead. But then her daughter goes into diabetic shock...she needs insulin. So when Jodie thinks she can make it to her daughter's room where a refrigerator (mini one) is by her bed, the two 'remaining' guys get in there with the daughter. Luckily Jodie throws in the bag of needles and insulin bottles into the panic room right before the door shuts. One of the guys is nice enough to give the girl the shot. When the two guys aren't looking, the little girl hides the needles behind her back. It all comes down to a shocking, suspensful ending that will be making you cling onto your seat or the person next to you! Go see this movie, it will live up to your  expectations!

The special effects at the end are very good.My only complaint is that the movie does portray Archeaologists as being grave robbers. That is not the case. Archeaologists are dedicated people.

673022,"This is uncomfortable drivel.  O look, of course it's funny to some extent - Gerard Derpadieu mouths off homophobic abuse, not once but repeatedly, and his derision is (surprise, surprise) a shield against his own inclinations - yes, you will laugh, but essentially this same joke is repeated a dozen times, by which time you might well have ceased laughing; then Gerard has some kind of mental breakdown, and mental illness is, in the best Hollywood tradition, a source of much merriment.  This cliche is typical of the entire film - other examples: if you need a villain, make sure you cast a foreigner (thus Daniel Auteuil's ex-wife is Dutch); to sustain a plot you must have an implausibly successful romance (I think the writer consulted 'Revenge of the Nerds' for some plot tips here); the cliches surrounding homosexuality are also deployed relentlessly, and reflex and habit will have you laughing along with the rest of the audience, at least for a while - just don't think too much about why you are laughing, 'don't think too much' being, I suppose, a worthy motto for most present-day popular cinema.  Personally, I wish that I'd contented myself with viewing the trailer and giggling at the poster featuring Daniel Auteuil wearing an oversized condom - the film itself adds little to these pleasures.",The Closet

It has hilarious dark humor like when Ash's hand goes bad and hits him in the head with plates! Director Sam Raimi keeps the surprises coming with this one like when Ash looks at himself in the mirror and Evil Ash comes out! Sam Raimi as a director is very talented because, he can make a movie, write the script for it, and then mix all of these surprise key elements with it. When he started out doing the whole Evil Dead trilogy he started the first one out on a very low budget for I think maybe around Four-Thousand dollars. The second Evil Dead he had a higher budget. The third movie Army Of Darkness was a much higher budget than both the first and the second film combined. Look at Sam Raimi now! He directed Spider-Man which is not a low-budget film. This movie itself has an excellent plot! Ash is still trying to get away from the cabin but, the deadites won't let him. Then some people go their to find the proffesor so that they can give him the rest of the pages to the Book of the Dead and I am not going to tell you the rest so just go out and buy this movie!

When the story finnaly does show up you don't care anymore. By that time you have seen more gore than is needed. The so called Gore era has had it's hits like Friday the 13th and Dawn of the Dead but this piece of [junk] is not one of them.Lucio Fulci is known as one of the masters on Italian horror, along with his fellow countryman Dario Argento, but after seeing quite a bit of Italian Horror I am now convinced that almost no one in that particular field has even the smallest amount of talent. I mean do we really need to see someones eyeball getting rammeed into a stick? Fulci made very bad films (and Argento is no better) and for some reason people think this man is a geinus. I have always said that the best filmmakers rely on there talent more than there FX to get them though.How much blood was in The Excorcist?Movies like this make me sad and angry bscouse we all know of better horror films that don't get the same attention and really should becouse pieces of trash like this take up space.In the end this is just one of the worst films ever made.

The fact that they learn to work together and grow from their experiences is more than I normally expect from a high energy action adventure flick.I'll see it again.",N/A
426130,"I remember travelling to London to see Madonna's opening night of this Tour in September 1993.  I was very excited &amp; moreso because up until that point I thought that the Blonde Ambition was the most lavish spectacular ever brought to stage &amp; screen.  What could Madonna do next?  The Girlie Show is definitely not a duplication of Madonna's 1990 Tour.  Lavish, yes, but it does not go the Greatest Hits route.  Madonna at the time was getting a lot of bad press due to the nature of her Sex book (which is very bland really) &amp; her Erotica album (which I feel is one of her best).  The Girlie Show therefore had to be something else &amp; it is.  Lipsyncing aside (Erotica/Justify My Love/Vogue), The Girlie Show is an impressive hommage to spectacles of old from harlequins to troubadours, 70s Disco &amp; Deitrich, Madonna's Tour demonstrates her cultural awareness &amp; her influences.  The show, like the Blonde Ambition Tour is divided into segments.SEGMENT 1: The Dita files.  A series of darker dance numbers performer by Madonna in her Dita outfit.  Erotica, the show's opener is Madonna's sole presence on stage, with dancers in the background.  Good for what it is. But does not get the juices flowing, as the songs lyrics promise. Fever rocks - not one of my fave songs by Madonna, but she gives it plenty of life &amp; sings it live! as well - she lipsynced to this one in London. Quite a sexy routine also with 2 dancers.  Madonna flirts with the crowd. Vogue is an elaborate spectacle, with Madonna, Nikki &amp; Donna wearing what look chandeliers on their heads, &amp; indulge in artsy dancing.  Cool.  Rain demonstrates Madonna can sing &amp; harmonise.SEGMENT2: 70s DISCO. This part of the show is a partayyyy sequence with a totally blinding version of Express Yourself, moving into the feather boa dance routine of Deeper &amp; Deeper, before slowing down a bit for Why's It So Hard &amp; then In This Life, which has Madonna alone on the steps singing about lost friends. Bless.SEGMENT3: WHAT IS GOING ON? SECTION: Madonna does Like A Virgin as Marlent Deitrich, dressed up as a man flirts outrageously with dancing girls on Bye Bye Baby &amp; then proceeds into the most unexpected live! song ever - I'm Going Bananas.  Nuts.THE HITS: We then move into a wondrous rendtion of La Isla Bonita, spanish dancing et al &amp; then a Military version of Holiday, which gets the audience livened up &amp; Madonna genuinely appears to be enjoying herself &amp; smiling without force.The traditional expression save the best for last is true here.  The encores are two very different sounds &amp; images.  Madonna goes to Ascot Horse Racing is the theme of Justify My Love, a very decadent type of Les Liaisons Dangereuses, with eloquent top hats, tails &amp; lavish dresses (which is more 1920s than 1780s).  Madonna's outfit is a combination of man-woman.  The song is sultry &amp; one I would never have imagined to be done live.  It livens up at the end with the dancers all performing a hand-clapping routine.  Bonkers.  The showstopper is again a song I was not expecting, yet one of my faves.  A totally reworked version of Everybody which breaks into Dance To The Music &amp; then becomes all funky.  It is euphoric &amp; the total climax to the show IMHO.  Add to this a secret clown who turns out to be Madonna &amp; you have the impression that depsite the lack of greater hits like Papa Don't Preach/Open Your Heart, etc that Madonna does want to entertain her crowd &amp; moreover interact with them.  She does so well, or at least as warmly as I've ever seen her.  Bad press asides, the sheer content of the show alone is enough to remind fans why they attended the show (&amp; there are A LOT at this show - &amp; she played 4 nights at this cricket ground as well as performing in other Australian cities!!!!) &amp; why Madonna is one of the best at her game",N/A

337799,"I've got to thank Warner Bros. for finally coming out with ""The Curse of Frankenstein"" on DVD.  And where as I was a bit suspect of the quality of the film element used for the ""Horror of Dracula"" DVD released on the same date as ""Curse"", I have no complaints at all about the quality of this film's presentation by Warner.It is beautiful.  And apparently Warner used a very fine quality source print for this release.  The colors are lovely, and the widescreen presentation is satisfying.  As a great admirer of Hammer films, it is exciting to finally see this beautifully photographed film as it was seen on the big screen in 1958.The story is much closer to Mary Shelley's original novel, though the creature, here played by Christopher Lee, is much like the one portrayed by Karloff; large, horrifying to look at, and almost an ""idiot"" in intellectual capacity, but somehow tugging at our sympathies.  But he is more frightening to behold in this film, with his ghastly white complexion, and bizarre, searching eyes.  As the film progresses, he becomes even harder to behold as he is ravaged by the terrifying encounters that make up his sad, short existence.And Peter Cushing is astonishing in his portrayal of Baron Victor Frankenstein.  He is a single-minded, driven scientist.  Both brilliant intellectually, and uncompromising in vision.  And yet, he is also not exactly evil, though his actions are, as is seen clearly by the murdering of his one-time lover and maid, Justine, as you see both determination and regret reflected in his expressions, while he listens to her screams.It's easy to see why, when viewing both ""Horror of Dracula"" and ""Curse of Frankenstein"", these two films made Cushing and Lee international stars and horror icons.  Both films have come to represent all that made Hammer Sudios great in their glory days, with lavish period sets, beautiful color photography, and music scores that rivalled bigger budget Hollywood films.The DVD itself holds no extras of worthwhile mention.  The facts presented in the small section called ""The Making of a Monster"" are nothing that any entry level Hammer film follower would not know already.  It's a shame that Christopher Lee couldn't be encouraged into doing a commentary, or a short interview on the film's history and its influence on modern horror.  That may not be Warner Bros. fault, as we all know, Lee has been very busy of late on the big screen, and keeps very busy off of screen.Both ""Curse of Frankenstein"" and ""The Horror of Dracula"" DVDs are a must for Hammer film lovers.  Hopefully, if sales are good, Warner will release the other Hammer films they hold license to, such as ""Taste the Blood of Dracula"" and ""Dracula Has Risen from the Grave"".",Curse of Frankenstein VHS
595480,"Alfonso Cuaron follows his two fine and individual literary adaptations - 'The Little Princess', 'Great Expectations' - with a modern, 'original' road movie that is more novelistic than either of them.  In the ironic mode of 'Magnolia', 'Amelie' and 'The Royal Tennenbaums', the very cinematic action is broken off by a parodically omniscient narrator who provides every scene with more detail than it needs, filling in back-stories, articulating feelings characters don't show, and even inventing futures for them.  But whereas this narrative voice in the previous films was a part of their breathless stylistic brio, here it performs a different function.  Each narration is announced by a breaking off of the action, a turning down of sound - rather than integrating itself with the overall tone, it breaks it, distancing itself from the comic antics, trusting the extraordinarily natural acting to keep our sympathy with the characters.  Though initially jarring, this device provides some of the film's most haunting effects, adding layers of perspective unavailable to young characters only living for the moment, but which may agonise them in hindsight.  Time and again, the film's narrow focus - two spoiled kids, who spend all their time joking,bragging about sex, drinking and smoking pot - is opened out to reveal different Mexican lives, lives not quite so privileged.  The road movie - the boys are taking their adulterous cousin's wife to a non-existent beach they drunkenly boasted about at a wedding - is a time-honoured vehicle for both a journey into one's developing, maturing character, and also into the state of the nation.  So while the Mexico the trio pass through is full of the colour and variety they patriotically boast of, it is also riddled with poverty, institutional racism, police brutality, and signs of death and residual superstition everywhere.  At a moment of supreme joy in the story, the narrator will intrude and tell us that such and such a character will lose his job and his home, or that someone died in a road accident etc.This device makes us less guilty about enjoying the energy and the wit, the generosity and the hormonally volatile company of two brats, one very rich indeed.  When they are having fun, the film sparks with pleasure at life; when they are not, you become impatient with the film's sombreness.  These kids need to be well off - only they have the freedome of mobility to travel through the various Mexicos Cuaron wants to show us.  They also have the complacency that needs to be tempered.  But one of these boys is an inheritor of the Mexican elite - his father is a government minister once linked to a near-genocidal  scandal; the President attends the gloriously gaudy wedding of his sister, all bullfighting and mariachis.  The boys, for all their sexual exploration, are like two Presidential envoys, investigating and reporting from Mexico, while the real rulers swan off to Washington for conferences about globilisation.Critics have compared 'And Your Mother Too' to 'Jules Et Jim', but the disenchanted political element is completely absent from Truffaut's film; a closer precursor would be Blier's Gerard Depardieu classic 'Les Valseuses', another road movie about two sexually obsessed young men who really want each other, and which casts a sharp eye on contemporary France.  The difference being that Cuaron cares about women, and his Luisa is a wonderful creation, her own zest for life co-existing with all kinds of pain, fear and betrayal only partially glimpsed through cracked windows by the boys.'Mother' shares a continuity with Cuaron's previous films, not just in the theme of young people unmoored from their dubious parentage and heritage, and the bittersweet narrative development, but in his amazing use of space, his ability to turn the domestic and familiar into the creepy and alienating - look at the supermarket high-jinx suddently caught in a vast, alienating long shot.  His loose shooting style conceals immensely complicated compositions, framing paralell stories in the one sequence shot or image, to devastating effect, such as Luisa's break-up call to her husband while the companions she can see are reflected beside her playing foozball.",Y Tu Mama Tambien
682478,"First of all let me start off by saying that although Rock star didn't do very well at the box office, I thought it was a lot of fun and it made for an enjoyable hour and three quarters viewing. Loosely based on the life of Tim `Ripper' Owens, the office supplies salesman who replaced Rob Halford in Judas Priest, Rock Star combines  satire, morality, romance and a good old fashioned rags to riches storyline.So what's the plot? Salesman and ordinary working stiff Chris Cole (Mark Wahlberg) and wannabe rock star has been obsessed for years in his devotion to British heavy metal band Steel Dragon. As part of a tribute band, he is derided by his older brother who feels he should get a real job and his devotion to mimicry is so much that even his fellow tribute band members are sick of him, and they eventually dump him. Comforted by his patient and devoted girlfriend (Jennifer Anniston) Chris swears that he will prove them all wrong but he even he is shocked when he is invited to audition as the replacement singer in the band he adores. Of course he wins the gig and so begins a journey through the world of a rock idol, full of drugs, groupies, drink and general excessive behaviour.I'm not quite sure why this movie wasn't that successful. Sure it's not the greatest movie you will ever see and it offers no original insight but there's also very little to dislike about it. Critics may complain that it's neither full on satire such as `This Is Spinal Tap' or that it is full of clich&eacute;s but this is a movie that doesn't take itself too seriously and does not try to portray reality. Mark Wahlberg is perfectly cast as Chris Cole and Jennifer Anniston gives a very pleasing and likeable performance as Chris's loyal girlfriend, whilst some of the supporting turns (particularly from Timothy Spall as the seen it all before manager) are excellent too. Stephen Herek's direction is perfectly paced and unlike most modern movies it is not overlong and it feels shorter than it actually is. It has some truly excellent moments and you could do much worse than to check this out on a Saturday night.",N/A

521578,"Having grown up with comic books like the X-Men and its cousins, I tend to take them for granted now.  This is the era of far glitzier issues with whole teams cooperating to make the pages shock and titillate.  Life was a bit tamer then, comics were fun, but not exactly earth-shattering.  So thinking ""The X-Men, Ho-Hum,"" I did not bother to see the film when it came out.  That was a serious mistake.  I have a very large monitor, but there is no question but that I should have seen it then.This film is remarkable for many reasons.  First, the script is as fresh and up-to-date as could be.  Gone are the super heroic declamations (other than when Dr. Xavier and Magneto argue) and in their place is good, dramatic dialog delivered by talented, professional actors.  Then there is the filming, which consistently avoids any sense of cramped or overly open space.  It provides a seamless background for the special effects.  If the dialog has been brought down to a human scale, the visual imagery completely exceeded my expectations.Casting is wonderful too.  Logan (Hugh Jackman) and Xavier (Patrick Stewart) seem made for their parts, and the rest of the cast are no less able.  This is not a Dino De Laurentiis film with one or two good actors using spectacle to cover its weaknesses.  Instead, we have an entire cast that conspires to make the unbelievable real.  And Michael Kamen's music is also a treat.The film brings home far better than the comic series ever did that the problem being dealt with is not really good mutants vs. bad mutants.  Instead, the real issue is that these mutants are trying to live in a world full people who are suspicious and fearful of those who are 'different.'  This is a talel about the effects of prejudice, clothed in an action story.  The protagonists stand for two possible solutions.  Sometimes one can understand Magneto (Ian McKellan) despite his willingness to use evil for his purposes.The plot is the simple tale of Logan and Rogue's (Anna Paquin) coming to Dr. Xavier's school and the ensuing struggle to stop Magneto from turning a ray that makes humans into mutants on an assembly of diplomats.  Each of the characters contains a story, often deeply tragic, and each has given something up as the price of their talents.The DVD is a bit short on extras.  A short on the film's making, an interview with director Brian Singer, and various other bits and pieces.  A special feature that adds back in other versions of scenes sounds interesting, but actually amounts to very little.  This is a worthwhile film. If it did not have quite the impact on me that the first Star Wars did, it still was an engrossing experience in a jaded world.  Recommended.",X-Men VHS
479253,"First of all, if you've never seen a Quatermass film before, the name is pronounced KWAY-ter-mass. The three Quatermass films by Hammer are all adapted from British television serials in the 1950s; a fourth Quatermass series was televised in 1979. The general consensus is that of the Hammer films, _Quatermass 2_ is the best, and I have to agree. (As the British television versions go, I've heard several different opinions as to which Quatermass is the best, from the 1958 _Quatermass and the Pit_ to 1979's _Quatermass_.  The stories of these television serials are much too complicated for an average 90-minute B picture.)The screenplay for _Quatermass 2_ is a marvel of efficiency, setting up characters and situations with remarkable ease and confidence. Unlike other films in the series, this one doesn't seem burdened with too much exposition. Perhaps this is because most of us have already seen this story in a different form, as _Invasion of the Body Snatchers_. (The televised version of _Quatermass 2_ actually preceded _Invasion_ by a year or two.) But _Q2_ has a very different focus, articulating Britain's paranoia over a military-industrial complex that seems out of control. Sound familiar?Although the script is quite good, it's the superb direction of Val Guest that really makes the film work. He makes it easy for viewers to keep track of a complex chains of events, often pulling suspenseful moments seemingly from thin air. Brian Donleavy's square-jawed, straight-arrow performance as Professor Quatermass is perhaps a little too much like Joe Friday for my taste. Still, I frequently enjoyed Donleavy's overbearing manner, even though it's the only aspect of the film that feels dated now.One of the best and brainiest sci-fi films from the '50s ... well worth owning if you're a sci-fi fan, and well worth viewing if you're not. (By the way, the central ideas of John Carpenter's recent _Ghosts of Mars_ seem somewhat indebted to _Q2_, although _Q2_ is by far the better film.)",Quatermass 2

One thing that is very noticeable with this set is that the music has been digitally remastered and the sonic quality of the songs is markedly different from the dialogue in the rest of the movie.The extra disc provides a lot of insight into the making of the film and the whole Beatles scene.  Everyone from Richard Lester to the tailor and hairdresser on the film talk about their memories.  Klaus Voorman gives an interesting interview where he shows drawings that he made during the early years of Beatlemania.  There is also a documentary on the first disc that repeats clips from some of the interviews on disc 2 but most of the insights are unique to this special.Despite the fact that there is a lot of bonus content, even more would have been appreciated.  While there is an interview with the man who designed the film's movie poster, an actual gallery of posters and lobby cards would have been appreciated.  It would have also been appropriate to include theatrical trailers for the film.  This set does include DVD-ROM content but I did not have access to it so perhaps these things are located there.Other things that could've been added to disc 2 include deleted scenes shown in &quot;You Can't Do That! The Making of 'A Hard Day's Night'&quot; and the &quot;I'll Cry Instead&quot; intro that was added to the film when it was re-released in the 1980s.  Richard Lester's &quot;Running Jumping Standing Still&quot; film should have also been included since it's mentioned so much on the DVD.For fans of 1960s cinema or the Beatles, this set is a keeper.

If this were not a National Geographic documentary, I'd still believe it was.Details about the Supercroc are amazing and its ability to eat dinosaurs fully believable. Sadly, there were too few details about the 40-foot long crocodile; instead, the viwer is given a documentary that seems to spend about 90% of its time in praise of the amazing abilities of the people involved in the fact-finding required to link the supercroc to today's remaining species of crocodile. All could have been covered by a few lines of commentary explaining that there was detailed research on the likely similarities of size (and predetory instincts) of present-day breeds of crocodile and the supercroc: however, that was not the case; so be it! But, to collect the required comparative data, the crocodile-hunting scenes seemed so lacking in safety for the people involved that I remain somewhat discomforted about why National Geographic endorsed such amateur displays (including one crocodile hunter stepping on the nose of a crocodile and looking very fortunate indeed not to have become a crocodile meal!).Praise is certainly due to the amazing sculpting of what the supercroc would have looked like in comparison to mere human beings but, overall, too much time was spent on looking at the self-glorification of the presenters rather than the awesome glory of the supercroc.",National Geographic - SuperCroc
560397,"As a recent convert (no pun intended) to ""Jesus Christ Superstar"" fandom, I looked forward to the 2000 version with only slight reservation. Truth be told, the only real reservation I had was the knowledge that, unlike the 1973 motion picture, the 2000 version (based on a recent London stage revival) was shot entirely on video. That in mind, I was pleasantly surprised to discover that directors Gale Edwards and Nick Morris utilized clever cinematography to give the stage production a very cinematic feel. Unfortunately, that's about where the pleasant surprises ended for me. Apart from occasional standout performances delivered by supporting cast members, ""Jesus Christ Superstar 2000"" suffers seriously in comparison with its superlative 1973 predecessor. Glenn Carter (Jesus) and Jerome Pradon (Judas) have the difficult task of filling the incredibly big shoes of Ted Neeley and Carl Anderson in the original motion picture. Carter, who looks like he could be the possible offspring of Peter Fonda and the lead singer from that awful 80s hairspray band White Lion, has a fine voice which may have served him better if he'd attempted to find his own range rather than attempting to re-create Neeley's. Pradon has the most difficult job of the two, in my opinion, and although I give the man points for the guts it must have required to take on a role so brilliantly portrayed by Anderson in 1973, his chiseled good looks and powerful voice are simply not enough to make anyone forget the fact that somewhere in America, muddled in the obscurity of bit parts, there exists a 57-year-old man that rightfully should have become a superstar of stage and screen. Even the beautiful, vocally gifted Renee Castle (Mary Magdalene), despite her best efforts, pales in comparison with the genuinely moving and captivating performance of Yvonne Elliman as the original Magdalene. In addition the musical interpretations, although superior in sound quality to what you'll find on the dvd of the original motion picture, fall short. But it's not all bad news about ""Jesus Christ Superstar 2000"", for it succeeds wonderfully on one level: it makes you want to race out and buy yourself a copy of the original movie, which stands as one of the few motion picture musical masterpieces of the latter 20th century.",N/A

I guess I was hoping for this to be a real terror-inducing ride, and although it certainly has it's unsettling moments, I never really found myself checking the corners for zombies afterward. However, what it lacks in chills, it more than makes up for in pure, stylish violence. Milla Jovovich jump-kicking the rotting hounds is a standout scene, and there are plenty of those slow-mo bullet shots (ala The Matrix) that directors seem to dig so much these days.But, in the end, the film left me longing for more scary. It seems that the director abondoned the elements that make the game such a terrifying thrill, replacing them with sleek sci-fi action. Not that that's a bad thing really but.. let's just say it would have been a lot creepier had it been modelled a bit closer to it's interactive counterpart.",N/A
682595,"""Lagaan"" - a Foreign Language Film Academy Award Nominee for 2001 - is a film, of all things, about cricket.  As in many modern Bombay films, you'll find musical numbers, love triangles and lots of energy, but somehow this movie manages to tie it all into a cricket match and make it very, very watchable.  How this is possible - cricket is a game that I, like most Americans, find completely incomprehensible - is beyond me, but it's done and done well.The basic plot is that a tyrannical British captain in 1893 British-ruled India challenges a group of poor, starving Indian peasants to a game of cricket.  If the peasants win, they'll be absolved of their grain levies (the 'lagaan') for three years.  If they lose, they'll have to pay triple.  From there, the movie follows love triangles, musical numbers, morality plays, religious discussions and culture clashes for three and three-quarters hours, but somehow never becomes boring - even if the movie is completely predictable.For the DVD itself, the transfer and sound seem adequate - surprising when you consider that there is more than four hours of video on a one-sided disc.  There are only two extras - a filmography of the director and four main stars and one deleted scene.  However, deleted scene is almost 18 minutes long and the size of the movie pretty much prohibits anything else on the disc.I would recommend this DVD to anyone - families, movie enthusiasts, people looking for a way to kill a whole afternoon - whether or not they're familiar with Indian culture or the ""Bollywood"" phenomenon.  I am simply amazed that a movie so predictable made about such an unlikely subject - cricket - could be so wonderful.",Lagaan: Once Upon a Time in India

77247,"This fresh cinematic spin on the infamous &quot;Hit Man&quot; doesn't seem to be well known and that's a shame.  'The Hit' is very sly and cunning, stepping far astray from the usual efficiency associated with these individuals, and contains ingenious plot twists guaranteed to keep you guessing.  Though it is British the film remains accessible to all moviegoers; the accents are easy to understand and the dialogue is not completely bound to British standards.A pair of hit men, Braddock, a wily veteran and Myron, a greenhorn, track down former gangster Willy Parker, who squealed on his former partners and has been hiding out in Spain for ten years.  The hit men intend to take Willy to Paris to meet his former boss before he is summarily executed but an unexpected complication occurs that throws the plan into disarray.  Attempting to alleviate the problem only causes it to snowball beyond belief and soon the two hit men are forced to take a hostage along the way.  Willy's lackadaisical approach to his certain demise displeases his &quot;escorts&quot; who expect him to be quite fearful of his impending doom.  The hostage is a bit of puzzlement as well and Myron takes it upon himself to look after her interests.  As events continue unfolding causing more chaos it isn't long before Myron is questioning Braddock's control of the situation.To say anymore would be an unforgivable transgression; suffice it to say that 'The Hit' is a movie you won't regret having spent time watching.  Besides being directed by Stephen Frears it also features Terence Stamp, John Hurt and Tim Roth - his film debut - in the three key roles.  The screenplay allows for a few terrific action sequences, frequent suspense, laugh-out-loud humor and even some very memorable scenery in Spain.  The theme music performed by Eric Clapton is among the best of his compositions and he gets an assist from Roger Waters of Pink Floyd fame.  'The Hit' is a movie deserving of cult status for its many offbeat touches and unconventional manner of storytelling.  Do yourself a real favor and set aside some time to watch this film - but beware!  You'll find that once isn't enough!",N/A

George Lucas (executive producer) is lucky that he always has the Star Wars and Indiana Jones franchises to fall back on.One can only imagine what was going through everyone's minds when they decided that ""Howard The Duck"" just had to be brought to the big screen.  This is truly a one joke movie stretched out for an abhorrent 110 minutes.  Howard is a walking and talking duck (of course!) who lives on a planet where ducks have evolved into the predominant species.  He is accidentally zapped by a laser shot off into space by some scientists here on Earth (Don't ask!).  He ends up being sucked off of his home planet and ends up here on our planet.A chance encounter brings him face to face with a struggling musician named Beverly, played by Lea Thompson.  She takes the feathered phenomenon home with her and develops an awkward relationship with him.  Perhaps I don't fully appreciate the innuendos made about bestiality in this movie.  Anyway,  the story soon spirals wildly out of control when the scientists use their laser again.  This time it has zapped a dark overlord (No...I'm not kidding!) to our planet.  Not surprisingly, the overlord isn't interested in sightseeing and getting to know Earth's inhabitants.  Instead, he wants to bring a few of his demon friends down here and extinguish all of the Earthlings.Everything culminates in a rather dull and predictable ending.

602897,"This film would have made a great ""made for TV"" film similar to the Hallmark Hall of Fame movies we are treated to once in a while. It's only about 90 minutes long, so with a few commercials to round it out to 2 hours, it would be just about right for TV. It's lightweight, romantic, involves a family, a bit of fantasy, and a bad guy who is not overly evil. The small amount of violence is not gory or frightening. It has a typical romantic plot, ""we're in love but we must sacrifice for a greater good.""  I loved the book and I really enjoyed the movie, but it was very predictable and rather too fluffy in spots. My only real complaint with it is that I left the theatre thinking about whether or not to do my grocery shopping rather than being swept up in the film's ambiance and drama. I didn't feel like I should tell all my friends to get out there and see it immediately. A five star movie really moves me and this one didn't do the job. Having said that, I must hastily add that all of the actors were superb. This story is about the Tuck family who accidentally drank from an enchanted spring and are gifted and cursed with everlasting life without aging.  A girl, Winnie, who is growing up as the only daughter of a well-to-do, proper and very repressive family and who yearns for more out of life, crosses paths with the Tuck family's youngest son. Bittersweet romance ensues. In the movies, magic almost never fits seamlessly into ordinary life, so of course there are major complications such as a greedy bad guy and a crises when the modern world interfaces with the ageless one of the Tuck family. William Hurt and Sissy Spacek were wonderfully understated and seemed just like the simple parents they were supposed to be, just really nice folks caught up in a tragic circumstance where all they can do is to keep on keeping on and try to live decently and with love. Any time Sissy was on the screen my attention was riveted though she remained soft and emotional and kindly. Ben Kingsley was a wonderful villain. He created his characterization with brilliant use of voice and facial expression and was never overtly evil, yet dripped with greed and self-centeredness. The young actors were all very, very good but the director had them cavorting too much with skipping and running, young wild manes flying and the mandatory romantic device, stripping down for a swim in a secluded pool beneath a waterfall.  It seemed like we were being sold the romance rather than like it was unfolding naturally. That sounds nit-picky but when you see it I think you'll see what I mean. It's just so cliche that even though it looks pretty on the screen, it is uninvolving.I liked this film, all in all, but it doesn't require the big screen treatment to be enjoyed to its fullest. It is short and would be a great home DVD rental for family TV night. Nice story, good actors, cinematography, set decoration, music...all tied up like a pretty package with a Hallmark card on top.",N/A
255566,"Fleming's James Bond was derived from Charteris' Saint, and Flint is derived from James Bond. Derek Flint is the best agent the United States has, and now they need him. Of course the fact that he has moved on, adds a bit of difficulty to bringing him in. You see he only takes an assignment if he wants to.This was the best spoof of the Super-Spy genre up until True Lies. Flint is not anomalous with Bond, he is better in every way. He has more girls, more devices (though he designed his devices himself instead of relying on a Q division), is a superb martial artist, a scientist, an animal trainer, and the ultimate gentleman. Of course, the opposition is aware of him, and they try to remove him before he can be a factor, leaving a clue for him to track down.Though Flint is too good to be true, Coburn carries the role out with just the right amount je ne sais quoi.

229247,"Most Bruce Lee fans HATE this movie.  They (or I should say ""we"", since I'm a Bruce Lee fan) note the use of very transparent doubling by Kim Tai Chung & others, the drastic change of plot from Lee's original story-line, & the use of footage from Lee's actual funeral in the film.I understand why these fans dislike ""Game of Death"" so much & I respect their beliefs.  However, I think these fans are reacting a bit too strongly.There are some good points to this movie:1.  The high production values.  Remember, this is 1978.  Hong-Kong movies from THIS time period weren't what they are today.  Jackie Chan was just starting to find his way with ""Snake In The Eagle's Shadow"" & with the exception of the Shaw Brothers, most Hong-Kong films from this time period were cheap, exploitation flicks.  We're still a few years away from John Woo, Tsui Hark, or Ang Lee.2.  The John Barry musical score.  Remember him?  He's the one behind ""The James Bond Theme.""3.  The opening title credits by John Christopher Strong the Third.  The floating games of chance, combined with John Barry's musical score give the film a ""classy"" action-movie feel, like a Bond film, quality-wise, that is.4.  The major American stars Dean Jagger, Hugh O'Brien, Gig Young, & Colleen Camp.  Okay, this is supposed to be Hong-Kong & one reviewer pointed out that in real-life, the heads of Hong-Kong's papers & crime-syndicates would be Chinese.  But again, this is 1978.  Lee did want to break out onto the mainstream by working with major ""American"" actors.  (Lee himself, of course was an American, since Lee was born in San Francisco, but raised in Hong-Kong.)  ""Enter The Dragon"", while being an obvious James Bond swipe, was successful, not only because of Lee's great talent & charisma, but also because that film featured American stars at the time.  (If you can consider John Saxon a ""star"", that is.)5.  The locker-room fight.  No, that's not Bruce Lee fighting Bob Wall, it's doubles Kim Tai Chung & Chen Yao Po.  But it still is impressive & for this scene, at least, the cutting in of clips from ""Way of The Dragon"" (or ""Return of The Dragon"") actually works.6.  The plot.  Okay, some people don't like the story, but it's obviouse that writer Jan Spears based the story on the rumors surrounding Lee's death.  (In truth, he died of an allergic reaction to the pain-pill Equagesic, causing his brain to swell with an edema.  However, there were rumors, and that's all they were, just rumors, that he was killed by the Triads for refusing to give them a piece of his successful film-company.)  The character of ""Billy Lo"", faking his death after an attempted murder, so that he can do battle with the syndicate, is based on the Bruce Lee MYTH.  (Kind of like the way the 1957 Elvis vehicle ""Loving You"" is based on the Elvis Presley myth.)I'm not arguing with the fans who hate this movie.  They are fans of a true innovative genius of the martial-arts & so I can't say that they are wrong.  However, the REAL script & missing additional footage from Lee's original ""Game of Death"" wasn't uncovered until the mid-1990's.  I'm not saying Raymond Chow & Robert Clouse weren't thinking of money when they ""finished"" ""Game of Death.""  (After all, the film industry is a business.)  But I don't see an exploitation picture when I watch ""Game of Death.""  Instead, I see a well-intentioned (if somewhat misguided) tribute to the genius of Bruce Lee.P.S.  To see what Bruce Lee intended for his original version of ""Game of Death"", watch ""Bruce Lee:  A Warrior's Journey.""  This documentary has a detailed rendering of Lee's script outline, as well as over 30 minutes of completed footage for the film's finale.",Game of Death VHS

523881,"This film was fantastic, it was recommended to me by an online friend so the next day I headed out and rented it and it was one of the biggest shocks I have ever had from renting a film. It shocked me because it was so good, after reading a couple plot out lines I figured all I would have to look foreward to was the cool sounding creatures. To my great suprise it turned out this film offered a fun story, great characters, some of the best special effects I have seen in a very long time and yes, Riddick.Riddick (Vin Diesel) is the main protagonist of the film, he is an escaped convict and multiple murderer, who somehow, turns out to be the most likeable character in the film. After seeing this film Vin Diesel became one of my favorite actors. Also this film featured some other pretty interesting characters, who I can't really describe without spoiling the film. But Johns (Cole Hauser) was very interesting and I think was kind of missed or forgotten due to Vin Diesels great character. I would say, had Riddick not been SO cool Johns would have became somewhat of a cult hero.And the beasties, I refer to them as Raptors, are some of the coolest movie monsters I have seen in quite some time as well. Especially the POV shots from them, a visual interpretation of what echolocation looks like. And you see many stages of life for these creatures as well, from baby &quot;hatchlings&quot; to full grown adults or &quot;big boys&quot;. The portrayal of these creatures is strikingly realistic. They're in my top 5 best movie monsters list.As for the DVD, this seemed to be more promising than it turned out to be. I expected much more gore in the &quot;unrated&quot; version but there was very little extra blood and guts, it mostly just featured more stuff that was probably cut for time constraints. The commentary was really good too, David Twohy, Vin Diesel and Cole Hauser all on the same track, it was pretty funny when they told stories from the set and funny little happenings around the set and things. The rest of the features, I felt, were some what lacking, Raveworld thing, it seemed to have nothing to do with the film at all. Cast and Crew bios were kinda lacking as well.All in all, buy this version instead of the &quot;R&quot; rated version just because theres some fun new footage, but don't buy it because you think theres more gore or anything, there really isn't.",N/A

127803,"As was the case with the new version of Pearl Harbor, Titanic does NOTHING to honor those who actually did die abord the great vessel.  This film won best picture but I can guarantee you it was mostly due to the graphics that were, at the time, way beyond anything we'd seen before.Leo is depressing. That's right, he's flat out depressing. I felt bad for him and the overacting job he does in this snooze fest. To think that Babwa Walwa's(also known as Barbara Walters) considered Leo one of ""Hollywood's most powerful men!""  HA. The only thing powerful about Leo's perfomance in this film was his triumphant ability to make me fall asleep.  I tell you the truth, most of my incoherant, sleeping pill induced dreams possess more imagination than Titanic.You want plot? Okay, in case you skipped Fourth Grade History or missed out on Common Knowledge 101, we have a big ship. It sinks, a bunch of people fall off like ping pong balls, and most of them die. Of course, we get to see a love triangle in the meantime and eventually witness poor Leo sacrificing everything - including his common sense - in order to save the one he loves. End of film. Sound nice? Well it is, if you like Chick Flicks and Leo. The only thing I liked about the fabricated portions of this film was the end where Leo meets the cold, harsh Atlantic Ocean and....well, I don't want to spoil it for you.Buyer beware: this film is a complete and total chick flick. It spends over 80% of itself focusing on the love triangle and please note: it's perhaps the most nightmarish love triangle ever, excluding the one in Pearl Harbor of course. If that's not enough, you will hear Celine Deon(spelling) sing the song that made her what she is today! Oh, the humanity!!I did give this film two stars because the ending is quite fascinating, especially the scene where the captain sees the water about to crash through his window. Nice effect!Here's to peace, love, and small rafts that only hold one person after a ship sinks! :-)",Titanic VHS
532173,"I was completely ready to enjoy ""Quills"" based on what I had read about it beforehand, but I was sorely disappointed in the movie. Geoffrey Rush plays a feisty and perpetually aroused Marquis de Sade, locked away in an asylum but still producing flowery erotic stories to pass the time. Kate Winslet plays a sympathetic maid who smuggles his stories to publishers who turn them into best-selling bootleg books. That's the first thing that bothered me about the movie -- was there really no one else in Napoleonic France who could produce absurdly overwritten ...P>The characters are mostly devoid of nuance. Rush's de Sade is a one-note leering horndog. Winslet's virginal chambermaid appeals to both de Sade and Joaquin Phoenix's character, the repressed cleric who runs the asylum. I did like Phoenix's turn as the priest who is tolerant enough to become friends with de Sade; I thought his work in this movie was more subtle and interesting than in ""Gladiator"". Michael Caine is a humorless scientist (with torturous medical techniques) appointed as an ""advisor"" to the asylum to suppress de Sade's writing. Even the random assortment of asylum inmates seem like stock characters: the pyromaniac; the giant; the guy who thinks he's a bird.""Quills"" reminds me strongly of two other movies. ""One Flew Over The Cuckoo's Nest"" is, to me, a far better look at a free spirit trapped in an asylum that is trying to repress him. The other is ""The People vs. Larry Flynt"", another movie which takes the side of the pornographer as the system tries to censor him. ...; in this movie de Sade is portrayed as a wickedly sexual but mostly harmless producer of satirical smut that appeals to everyone but the repressed elite. In real life, de Sade was famous for torturing women and is the inspiration for the term ""sadism"".I wanted to like ""Quills"" but the snippets of de Sade's writing we are given are absurd and sometimes funny but not really erotic, and while I agree with the anti-censorship theme of the movie, it is not presented in an interesting or thoughtful manner. It's more like a Rodney Dangerfield snobs-vs.-slobs movie where the lower classes are all titillated by de Sade's stories and the upper classes can only shudder and try to squash him. I think ""Quills"" would fit better as a theater production, where the interactions between de Sade and his captors might be more interesting, but the story just doesn't seem ""big"" enough to merit a whole movie. The vast majority of the movie takes place in the asylum, a lot of it in de Sade's cell, and as it played out to its inevitable resolution there just wasn't anything in the way of scenery, character development or originality to keep me interested. I'd instead recommend ""Cuckoo's Nest"" or ""Larry Flynt"", or ""Elizabeth"" if you want to see Geoffrey Rush in period garb.",Quills
705896,"Mel Gibson has been type-casted as the leading hero for movies such as ""Braveheart"" (which he directed, produced, acted), ""The Patriot"" & for ""We Were Soldiers"", he snugged in the role comfortably.  For this offering, he rejoined with Randall Wallace, who penned ""Braveheart"".  This time, Randall Wallace took the helm, & perhaps, he's been given more flexibility by Mel's film company, Icon Production, & therefore, ""We Were Soldiers"" was able to shine whereas ""Pearl Harbour"" wouldn't match.  One of Randall's forte was to give us a glimpse of humanity at work in the war that United States shouldn't be involved at the first place.  For the first time, Vietnamese was shown a matching fighter against US' military might.  We were also brought into the realm of the armies' families witnessing first-hand the wives' initial denial but eventual acceptance of the demise of their husbands (& fathers of their children).  Their greivance were heart-felt & for the first time, we were shown perspective of both Americans & Vietnamese.  I sincerely believe that this movie covered a lot of ground such as bringing to our attention that in a war, it's irrelevant what races they are.  The soldiers are brothers in arms, & they are fighting the war as Americans & therefore, in time of dire needs, it's their duty to look after one another.  The movie questioned the need of fighting someone else's war, & brought to surface the treatment of soldiers when they returned from Vietnam, friendly fire.  In the end, when we were shown the Memorial at Washington by Maya Lin then, we would start to appreciate the poignancy but continuing legacy of America's foreign policy.  Highly recommended but not for the faint-hearted.  It's good to see Madeline Stowe back to the silver screen again, & the leading lady from TV series, Felicity acting in a feature movie, & what a display of talent from Nina from 3rd Rock from the Sun.

683861,"When I first started watching Love Hina, I found it to be very amusing and well-animated.. however, after sitting through the entire series, I found my attitude towards it had changed dramatically. If you're looking for a ""loser guy is surrounded by tons of beautiful women who beat the stuffing out of him on a daily basis but secretly think he's a good guy"" series, then you have found the perfect match.Poor Keitaro is an everyman, a somewhat loveable loser who finds himself in the situation of his dreams - living with gorgeous girls - only to have the worst luck around them, ending up in situations that make him look like a huge pervert. Keitaro falls in love with one girl, Naru Narusegawa, who loves nothing more than to kick him into orbit every five minutes. The entire point of the series is to see if Keitaro can get Naru to return his affections.I admit that I did enjoy some of the series, notably the one where Keitaro dreams the girls into a video game, and one or two of the ""Motoko the Kendo-Girl isn't so mean as she seems"" shows. However, the number of mindless filler episodes far outnumbers the good ones, and even when the show attempts to convey that Keitaro is Feeling Deep Emotions and You Should Sympathize With Him, I mostly found myself yawning and wishing the show would develop some substance (or at least some unrelated to the chest size of the Hinata Sou girls).If you like eye candy in the form of teenage girls, or think the same stunt repeated ad infinitem (namely one or all of the girls attacking Keitaro every ten seconds) is amusing, you'll probably enjoy this series. If you like anime with substance and plot, you might want to pass this over. Consider this the ""Dragonball Z"" of shounen romance stories - juvenile, repetative, and not that interesting.",N/A

True, it doesn't follow the story exactly, but Peter Jackson did about as good a job as you can expect anyone to do in three hours.  This movie is incredible.  There simply is nothing to complain about.  The acting is superb, with several cast members giving the performance of a lifetime.  The special effects are breathtaking, and the stunts and fight scenes very memorable.This film captivates you from the very start, when it tells the story of the rings, and holds you until the last moment, where we are left to wonder about the fate of the scattered fellowship (well, those who never read the books, at least).  I knew this film was a masterpiece when my wife, who hates the fantasy genre, insisted on seeing it 3 times in theaters.There is nothing but pure perfection in this film, and doubtless it will become as classic and legendary as the book that inspired it.",The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring
674214,"After a year long delay, the first of the three Orange Islands DVDs has finally been released! Pokemon fans know the Orange Island series as a short 33 episode &quot;bridge&quot; between the Indigo Pokemon League (the Red and Blue games) and the Johto League (based on the Gold and Silver games). Some regard the Orange League episodes as the best of the series, as this was the only series that was not based on the video games, so the writers were given more creative freedom about what they could have the characters do.In a nutshell, Ash, Misty and Brock arrive on the Orange Islands to retrieve a mysterious Pokeball for Professor Oak. While Ash and Misty decide to go off and explore the islands, Brock stays behind to assist Prof. Ivy. Ash and Misty soon meet up with Tracey, a Pokemon Watcher who likes to sketch Pokemon and people. He travels with them, which turns out to be a good idea, since he is familiar with the entire Orange Island chain. As they explore and discover new Pokemon, Ash is also competing in the Orange League (what a shocker, huh?)This DVD contains 12 episodes:-Pallet Party Panic - Picking up right where the Indigo League left off, Pallet Town is throwing a party for Ash, but some uninvited guests stir up trouble...-A Scare in the Air - Traveling to the Orange Islands by blimp sounds like a good idea, but with Team Rocket piloting, you know trouble's coming.-Pokeball Peril - Arriving on the Orange Islands, Ash and company meet the beautiful Professor Ivy, who possesses a strange Pokeball.-The Lost Lapras - Ash and Misty meet up with Tracey, and they try to help a injured Lapras to find its family.-Fit To Be Tide - Ash faces off with his first Gym Leader, but finds the Orange League a lot different to what he's used to...-Pikachu Revolts! - Someone is controlling the minds of Pokemon! Could someone nastier than Jessie and James be behind it?-The Crystal Onix - Ash helps a little girl find an Onix made entirely out of glass to help inspire her sculptor brother.-In The Pink - After getting stranded by whirlpools, our heroes discover an islands inhabited by pink Pokemon!-Shell Shock - Ancient Pokemon fossils are being uncovered, which could lead to a dark prophesy.-Stage Fight! - Ash comes upon a traveling stage show featuring Pokemon, but one of the stars doesn't feel like performing.-Bye Bye, Psyduck! - Misty's blundering Psyduck finally evolves into the super cool Golduck!... or did it?-The Joy of Pokemon - Ash and company meet a super tough Nurse Joy who aids Pokemon on small islands.The quality of the video is only a bit better than VHS, which is acceptable since there are 12 episodes jammed onto one disc. The audio is great, though pursuits will grip that there is still no Japanese track. Subtitles are available and fortunately the disc goes to the main menu instead of playing the episodes immediately. The trailer for Pokemon 4Ever is also available.Any Pokemon fan would love this DVD and it is highly recommended, as these are some of the most creative episodes from the entire series.

1775,"LIVE IN CHICAGO is a complete concert from Jeff Buckley's Mystery White Boy tour of 1995, which promoted his first album GRACE. While that is a record of great beauty and originality which I would recommend to anyone, LIVE IN CHICAGO is entertaining but unessential purchase even for fans. Besides the thirteen songs of the concert, this DVD also includes the electronic press kit for GRACE, and an in-studio performance of two songs in an acoustic fashion.The concert is nice, but one notices right away that it doesn't take one to any spiritual heights like when listening to GRACE or Buckley's two live CDs. The amateurish footage's bled colours subtract from the goodness of the music, and the concert took place in a cheap inner-city club that seems too low for someone of Buckley's talent. He played much larger venues abroad, it would have been better to get a concert film from one of those. Buckley opens up with ""Dream Brother"", proving that what was a closing track does make a good opening. ""Mojo Pin"", ""So Real"", and ""Grace"" were highlights of the album, but Buckley doesn't add anything new in their concert performances. Showing that he has been inspired by numerous musical influences, Buckley even throws a cover of MC5's ""Kick Out the Jams"", which is an abrasive and noisy track which leaves one with bad memories of the set. There are two great moments at the end of the set, an instrumental version of the song ""Vancouver"" (a vocal version of which was on Buckley's posthumously released SKETCHES FOR MY SWEETHEART THE DRUNK), and a delicate cover of Big Star's ""Kanga Roo"". Being a fan of the label 4AD's collaborative project This Mortal Coil, Buckley may have been inspired to cover ""Kanga Roo"" after hearing their remarkable cover, but his own rises above it.The bonus features of the DVD are a mixed bag. The acoustic songs shown live in studio during the recording of GRACE are rather lackluster. ""So Real"" and ""Last Goodbye"" had the energy they did on the album versions precisely because of their use of electric instrumentation. The electronic press kit for GRACE, however, is a diamond in the rough. A mix of footage from before and just after Buckley's signing to Columbia Records, it includes part of Mojo Pin filmed in Sin-E, the New York City cafe where Buckley first began to make it big, as well as an interview with Buckley showing a man of great talent a bit timid at having a major-label contract.All in all, LIVE IN CHICAGO is best left to die-hard Jeff Buckley fans, people who moved beyond his first album and bought SKETCHES and both live CD's released to date. Listeners who merely enjoy the magic of GRACE can safely pass this DVD by. It's pleasant, but nothing special.",N/A

677658,"When was the last time you felt the hairs stand up on your arms as you watched a film?  This radiant, measured drama, with a stubborn, diffident and magnetic performance by Mary Steenburgen, does it for me every time.  Telling the story of writer Marjorie Kinnan Rawlings and her sojurn in rural Florida in the 20's, it paints (and for once &quot;paints&quot; is the right verb) an eloquent portrait of the artist-as-not-always-likeable person, and also conveys an overwhleming sense of place and community.  Martin Ritt's great feeling for ordinary people breathes extraordinary life into this material, and the location settings and photography are superb.  Also superb are the supporting performances, including the acclaimed pairing of Rip Torn and the late, astonishing child actor Dana Hill as father and daughter.  But my personal favorite is Alfre Woodard's all-out, headlong portrayal of Geechee, Rawling's devoted, wild woman housekeeper.  This is the only film I know that conveys a real sense of the writer's life, and without pretense at that.  As for the raising of the hairs, there is nothing else in film to compare with the final lyrical montage that concludes the picture.  As Steenburgen speaks words from the text of Rawling's original &quot;Cross Creek,&quot; Ritt gives us image after ravishing image of Cross Creek and environs.  Once seen, you will never forget it.  The DVD is beautifully produced.  A treasure.",N/A

698709,"From the very beginning, Am&eacute;lie shows itself to be different from predictable American blockbusters.  Its opening sequence, the retelling of the salient points of Am&eacute;lie's childhood (according to her delightfully skewed view), draws the viewer into her sweet little world with its clever script and beautiful cinematography. We learn all about her parent's small quirks; her father, for instance, hates the feeling of wet swimming shorts sticking to his legs but thoroughly enjoys polishing his shoes to a deep shine, while her mother detests the wrinkled hands that come from bathing too long while finding great pleasure in empting out and reorganizing her purse. Amelie lives in a world where everyone can be categorized by such small but vitally important facts, and every little deed has its own reward.Am&eacute;lie spends her days in two activities, for she is both a waitress and a doer of good deeds. A decided introvert, the heroine delights in interesting ways of relating and interacting with the world which might not occur to the more literal minded. Much of the film is spend detailing the whimsical ways she discovers and carries out the most fantastical wishes of those unrecognized worthies that live around her. And in the midst of her small philanthropic acts, Am&eacute;ile thinks about about the mysterious man whose photo album she acquires when it falls right off his pannier, and plans how she might get in contact with him. The end, of course, is no surprise to anyone except Am&eacute;lie; though expected, it lacks not one bit of charm, and the seducer becomes the seduced in a beautiful turn of roles.The Paris shown is not a gritty city but rather the City of Lights as the dreamers might see it, and the enhancement of reality is perfect for the new view of the world it gives. We might see the world through Amelie's eyes, and thank goodness for it: I never knew the world could look this bright, nor the colors so sharp and dazzling. The little integration of computer animation that does occur is both unexpected and seamless, delighting in its whimsical nature. This movie is a treasure from all perspectives, and I look forward to seeing both past and future efforts from director Jean-Pierre Jeunet.",Amelie
90401,"My previous theory was that Mr Scott changed his movie because he wants to be taken seriously as an Artist, (hence the over-blown, bombastic style that made Hannibal a lesser film). I was heartened to read below that this ""director's"" cut was actually assembled by the studio, and that there may be a more developed version that retains much of the narration. As good as this cut is, THAT'S the version I'd like to see...I think people like the version without the voiceover because it's more mysterious and arty, and it disguises that fact that Blade Runner is basically a sci-fi version of a 40's detective movie. Sure, the voiceover grates a few times, but cut that out and you STILL get the police chief saying ""Talk about beauty and the beast - she's both,"" which is probably the worst line in the movie, and you still get the superfluous and awful dubbed dialogue in the snake shop.You also get one important piece of new footage: the unicorn dream. The problem with this insertion is (1) it is stuck seemingly at random into the middle of what was originally a smooth tracking shot with continuous soundtrack, and (2) the insert makes no sense in context and has nothing at all to do with the rest of the film...This scene would have been originally been excluded from the film because it doesn't fit the overall structure - sure, the added meaning makes some people feel deep, but on the other hand it invalidates what would otherwise be the main problem of the movie, which is Deckard's grappling with his feelings about killing creatures who might be ""human"". Instead it's a trick ending: ""Turns out he was a robot all along!"" which has nothing to do with the rest of the film.As you can tell, I have mixed feelings about this version, but of course it's still a great movie - it's Blade Runner, for God's sake!

Well, I'm not sure if that is a term that can be applied to Excel Saga, but it did appeal to this girl. I loved it! It's not a movie, but an anime series, and Volume 1 contains the series' first 5 episodes. I instantly fell in love with it, from the very first scene. It revolves around a teenage girl named Excel who has a habit of getting killed a lot (think: female version of South Park's Kenny). She decides to join an elite organization called ACROSS, and the members include...well...just her - and the organization's leader, Ilpalazzo, who wants to take over (brace yourselves) THE CITY!Of course, every episode revolves around Excel trying to help Ilpalazzo with his evil plan, and even though that is entertaining enough, there are so many supporting characters you will just fall in love with: her future sidekick who seems to be anemic; a homesick immigrant worker named Pedro who misses his son and ... wife""; annoying neighbors; cute little aliens; and an ""emergency food supply"" - her pet dog that looks more like a cat.The DVD itself is nothing to rave about, but you don't even need any great special features to enjoy it - each episode more than makes up for it. If you haven't seen Excel Saga yet, I think you should - even if you aren't an anime fan.

432922,"I first saw Halloween when I was a wee girl and can remember so clearly being beyond terrified and running to jump under the covers with my dad. The next day I popped it into the VCR and sat smack down in front of it, absolutely entranced by the eerie music and the jack-o-lantern glowing with evil. I am a huge horror fan and not a single one I've seen can even compare to this masterpiece! This movie is perfect with everything: the scenery mostly with the creepy neighborhood and autumn atmosphere; then there's that white mask Michael Myers wears with the hollow, unfeeling eyes and no expression; next are the characters which are all perfection, I think. Dr. Loomis is so serious and obsessed with finding Michael that he drives such fear in us. Jamie Lee Curtis is brilliant as the plain, responsible babysitter who won't believe Tommy when he tries to convince her that the bogeyman is coming after him that night; lastly there is that music. The heart-stopping, eerie, terrifying music. What else can one ask for in a horror film? Yes, there have been numerous slasher/stalker horrors made after this but ""Halloween"" was the one who began it all so it should get its much deserved recognition. The sequels to this movie are okay but somehow don't manage to set off the same spooky mood.",N/A
82782,"I won't bore you with yet another summary of the movie itself - even if you haven't seen it, you're probably familiar enough with the plot from numerous Disney adds in the past year, and if you're not, there are (as of this writing) 160 other reviews that will undoubtedly break the plot down for you.  Instead, I want to look at the DVD itself and the type of movie (and DVD) Disney has made here.First of all, the DVD is excellent - the picture and sound are wonderful and the extras for both adults and kids are surprisingly good.  For kids, the main extras are a ""DisneyPedia"" of Hawaii - a focus on the six biggest islands of the chain with a talk about various aspects of Hawaiian culture and nature prominent for each island, the ""Create Your Own Experiment Game"" - essentially a quiz on the movie narrated by David Ogden Steir's Jumba, a faux ""Stitch Through the Years"" documentary, and the ""I Can't Help Falling in Love With You"" music video, as well as the usual DVD-ROM links.  It's not jam-packed, but it's pretty decent for something that's on one disc and doesn't have ""Special Edition"" stamped across it in big, bold letters.  For adults, there are behind-the-scenes documentaries on the making of the film, the Hawaiian music from Kamehameha Schools, animating the hula and a half-and-half music video/behind-the-scenes look at Wynonna Judd's rendition of ""Burning Love"".  There are also half-finished deleted and alternate scenes (three in all, with lead-in commentary) and (my personal favorite) the four ""Stitch Invades Other Disney Movies"" teaser trailers.  When put together, it makes for a really excellent DVD on Disney's part.As for the movie itself, it's the best one they've done since at least ""Pocahontas"" and probably since ""Aladdin"" - it's got an excellent offbeat humor to it, it hits the right moral notes without descending into preachiness.  Likewise, it shows Hawai'i surprisingly effectively.  By having all the action on Kaua'i (the next island northwest from O'ahu) and The Big Island, they bypass Honolulu and much of the touristiness of the islands (although they do give tourists the occasional sardonic nod) in favor of the color, diversity and open acceptance that Hawai'i is, more often than not, known for.  Likewise, while staying firmly rooted in the silly, it strikes a very impressive balance between care and humor that seems to be harder to find with each passing year's new Disney movie.I really can't recommend this DVD enough.  Along with the quality of the movie itself, it's got a really impressive slew of extras.  Hopefully Disney can take a message from this movie that you don't need to threaten a limited shelf-life, plaster words like ""Uber-Diamond Edition"" across the packaging, or stick it in a limited edition tin to sell a good product.  Whether or not you've seen it, it's worth owning, and - for the price - it's the best DVD Disney's done so far.",Lilo & Stitch
589296,I am surprised. I really enjoyed Vanilla Sky. I quite expected to like parts of it but leave feeling a little irritated because it was difficult and I would be left swimming in ambiguity and pretense. But I thought Vanilla Sky was one of the most original movies I have seen in a long time and I had fun watching it. Its twilight zonish but it doesn't spin the movie on its ear like revelation in &quot;The Sixth Sense&quot;. However the movie is almost as fun to watch a second time around when you know what is really happening.  Everything is very clear at the end so I didn't feel jerked around. Or if I was being jerked around I really enjoyed the experience.  I wish I had seen it during first release because it would have been on my top ten list for the year. This is the kind of movie I enjoy liking because I know everyone doesn't. It will be fun meeting other people that liked it too.,Vanilla Sky VHS

Personally I thought George Lucas did a fine job of introducing the main characters while still having a story to go along with it and still tie it to the original trilogy. This DVD is excellent in that it is a two disc set with the movie seperating it from the extras which is what DVDs currently do. The extra scenes in the movie are magnificent in the quality that they were done. The usual theatrical trailers and the behind the scenes movies were good. Very excellent job done by the LucasFilm team. I highly recommend this to everyone!",N/A

558510,"Admittedly I am not familiar with the work of Andy Milligan. And after watching THE BODY BENEATH I surely won't check out his other movies.This strange vampire film is simply boring beyond belief. Obviously it was shot on a shoestring budget. It is talky and outright silly. There are vampires trying to cure their medical conditions ( e.g. high blood pressure ) with blood transfusions and leeches, laughable makeup effects ( watch out for those female vampire underlings!), cheap gore and a sex scene, where the director seems far more concerned to display the nude  actor's body than the feminine charms of the actress. ( Does this indicate a homoerotic proclivity? Well, watch the extra feature VAPORS...) Neither the very few and poorly done gore scenes nor the pseudo-straight sex scene add much entertainment value and the film isn't helped by bad actors and pedestrian direction either.Picture quality is not up to SOMETHING WEIRD's usual standard to say the least.Please notice: This is not a it's-so-bad-that-it's-good affair. It is REALLY bad.While I appreciate SOMETHING WEIRD's efforts to release obscure horror and exploitation movies on DVD, some films are better left forgotten.As for the extra features there are several trailers for Andy Milligan films: THE BODY BENEATH ( which is far more entertaining than the movie as a whole ), THE GHASTLY ONES, GURU THE MAD MONK, VAPORS and SEEDS OF SINS. There is also an Andy Milligan directed underground short VAPORS. If a 40 year old coming out tale set in a gay bathhouse makes a good supplementary feature for a horror film is questionable. Admittedly it is better in terms of direction, acting and dialogue.Really cool is the Gallery of Exploitation Art feature! But this excellent piece does surely not warrant the price of the DVD.",N/A

504254,"Jet Li portrays John Chang, a mainland Chinese bodyguard trained by the military to be the best and latest word in protection.  After using a controversial technique in a training exercise, he is diverted from taking a coveted assignment with his comrades. Instead he is sent to Hong Kong to protect a young woman, Michelle, who is the only surviving witness to a murder.  Michelle is the mistress of a wealthy man, who spares no expense at protecting her life after two other witnesses are murdered by the triad leader suspect's gang.Li's John Chang  is all business, a repressed, grim faced young man who has one objective:  to protect his client, even at the cost of his own life.  His vibrant charge soon finds his protective restrictions stifling and she sets about making life as difficult as possible for the man charged to protect her.  It is not until an attempt is made upon her life in a shopping mall she has stubbornly insisted on visiting, that she begins to appreciate her no nonsense guardian.Soon, appreciation leads to infatuation, and Michelle turns the full force of her romantic charms on the unsuspecting and emotionally ill-equipped Chang.  She buys him fancy clothes, an expensive watch, finding herself increasingly dissatisfied and impatient with her rich but milquetoast boyfriend. The romantic tension is almost too much for Chang, who finds himself uncharacteristically unable to concentrate on his work as her protector.The gang charged with her annihilation is now led by the brother of one of the gang killed at the shopping mall shootout.  He is intent on revenging his brother by killing John.  Taking advantage of Chang's distraction, he and his crew launch an attack on Michelles seemingly impregnable home which initiates the film's final showdown.Jet Li's martial arts skills take a back seat to gunplay and suspense until the climax of the film.  Li's wushu talents are on full display as he engages in hand to hand combat with his foe.  Intent on not repeating his mistake from the opening training exercise, Chang must now show a willingness to die for his client.Highly entertaining and ultimately more satisfying than Hollywood's The Bodyguard, Jet uses his screen appeal to good advantage in the film.  The supporting players are excellent, especially Kent Cheng as one of two policemen that aid John in protecting Michelle. An excellent viewing choice for those who may not be fans of Li's period wushu pieces, the film will probably disappoint those who crave fight-laden martial arts films.",The Bodyguard From Beijing

They are more interested in performing their own music and he wants to continue honoring Steel Dragon.  Why would he want to take a chance on his own music when he knows this hard pounding rock is the best?  His highest day comes when he gets a phone call from Steel Dragon's lead guitarist.  It seems that some groupies who were currently ""partying"" with the guitaristhad made a tape of one of Chris' performances.  This just happened to coincide with Steel Dragon dumping their lead singer.  Before he can fully process it, Chris and Emily have flown to the audition, and now he finds himself as the lead singer of his favorite band.After a shaky start, Chris fully establishes himself as their lead singer and his dream is fulfilled.  That is until Emily moves off on her own.  Chris drowns his sorrow in a full tilt dose of ""sex, drugs, and rock and roll"" living the life of every aspiring heavy metal singer and only slowly begins to realize the ironies of living your dream.If the sound of screaming guitars, power chords, synthesizers, and vocals doing things the human voice wasn't meant to do, frequently come from yourcd player...this movie is for you.  If you remember fondly the big hair of the 80s, the leather and spandex clad musicians, and the term ""GlamRock""...this movie is for you.I thoroughly enjoyed this one as did, much to her surprise, my wife. Walhberg looks like a kid in a candy store when he is up singing with the band and as an actor, he continues to get better and better. Don't stop watching when the credits role either.  Walhberg is talking at one point during the credits and ""Marky Mark"" bursts forth from the depths for a brief bit that is hysterical.  Jennifer Aniston actually did a decent job in this oneplaying someone other than ""Rachel"".The music was what really drove the movie.  I'm not necessarily talking about the actual performance but the pursuit of music.  It was evident in Cole's heart that is what truly mattered to him and he was really only alive when on the stage.  The actual performance was fun.  I know many of the 80s Rock Icons are on the sound track as is ""Steel Dragon"".  I haven't decided yet if this will be part of the collection but I am strongly leaning towards buying the soundtrack.",N/A
464095,"Will Smith is Robert Clayton Dean, a young yet prominent labor attorney in the DC area who suddenly finds his well ordered life going to hell.  Unknown to him, he's accidentally received a video disc implicating the Deputy Director of Operations of the NSA (Jon Voight) in the suspicious death of an influential senator - a disc passed to him moments before its owner's untimely death.  Unable to locate the disc, the wicked Dep decides to take Dean's life to pieces - finding much in Smith's character that isn't as ordered as it appears.  In fact, Dean's adventures as a labor lawyer frequently have him run up against organized crime bosses, including one played by Tom Sizemore.  Worse, to get his information, Smith relies on a shadowy figure named Brill, a man he's never met.  Instead, he maintains contact with Brill through a former lover (Lisa Bonet).  Drawing a line between Smith and Bonet using their ban accounts, the NSA wreck his personal life and implicate him in embezzlement.  On the run from the super-secret NSA with its satellites and its surveillance gear, with nowhere to turn, Dean's only hope is to find the mysterious Brill himself, learn the secret driving his pursuers and hope to fund some way to put his life back together.Not a lot in ""Enemy"" makes sense, but it's fast and, with Will Smith, often funny.  He's got a flip sense of humor that saves the movie that otherwise has few surprises.  Gene Hackman enters the scene as the shadowy Brill running, and he never stops.  Brill is essentially paranoia incarnate - though by the time we've met him, we know enough about the Government's surveillance methods to empathize with his fears.  Jon Voight plays the latest in a long line of heavies (he was the evil lawyer in ""Rainmaker"") but otherwise never connects as a villain.  But the real star of the flick is the direction, which is fast and coherent at the same time.  Otherwise, the flick pays lip service to Hollywood's need for an apparent message (beware nig government's intrusion on your privacy) without making the movie deep enough for you to care.

324980,"Flight of the Navigator is a far better movie than we'd have a right to suspect.Plot spoiler if you read further:A few minutes into this film, 12-year-old David Freeman (Joey Cramer) is on anerrand to retrieve his 8-year-old brother, Jeff, when he falls into a gulley and isknocked out. Regaining consciousness, David returns to his house, thinking only afew minutes have passed, and instead of his parents and brother finds a lockeddoor and an elderly couple living there.Taken to the police station, David is identified by computer records as a boyreported missing eight years before. Despite the fact that he hasn't aged, he's takento the Freeman's at a different house nearby, and when he sees his parentsobviously older, he faints. He returns to consciousness again on a gurney on hisway to a hospital bed. A few minutes later, while his parents are called out of theroom by a somber-faced doctor, David is left alone with his brother Jeff -- who isnow 16.This is ostensibly a Disney movie for kids -- and later on there is a lot of comedicDisney hijinks -- but the first half hour of the movie, as David and his family dealwith the trauma of his time relocation, are some of the most heart-rending andchilling sequences I've seen in any film.Spoiler over.This movie reminded me of some of the time-relativity sequences in Robert A.Heinlein's novel, Time for the Stars. The characters are well written and the actorsdo an excellent job, particularly in the scenes between Joey Cramer and MattAdler, as 16-year-old Jeff. The distraught parents, Cliff de Young and VeronicaCartwright, are also excellent -- and Howard Hesseman and Sarah Jessica Parkerround out a great supporting cast.Special kudos are due to Paul Reubens (best known for his character Pee WeeHerman) who was originally credited under his own name for lending his voice to amajor character in this film, but had his name removed from the credits, replacedby the pseudonym &quot;Pall Mall,&quot; after Reubens was arrested for alleged indecentexposure committed in a movie theater seat. (I've never understood how Reubenswas convinced to plead &quot;no contest&quot; to the charge, after theater security camerasshowed him in the lobby buying popcorn at the time of the alleged offense.)Considering that Disney's Hollywood Pictures division released Powder, directedby a convicted and confessed child molester, Disney should show some backboneand restore Reubens real name to the credits.If you can get ahold of this movie, see it -- and maybe Disney will see fit to releaseit again -- on DVD, I hope.",N/A

This is a classic Cinderella tale gone awry with beautiful Cinderella being played by a hooker.  Julia Roberts pulls off both aspects wonderfully.  Richard Gere is a great choice for a costar as he really fits the bill of a suave businessman.  The premise is pure, but the plot is seedy.  Julia is a prostitute with big aspirations squelched somehow by society, seemingly leaving her only this foul choice to make a living.  Gere is a filthy rich businessman who is out of town and needs a date for a dinner party.  Oddly, he thinks a hooker is the logical choice.  Yet, it works.  Julia fumbles through the etiquette of a world unfamiliar which lends the humor to this romantic comedy.  The chemistry between Roberts and Gere provides the romance that made this movie so very famous.  A star the size of Julia Roberts is not born of a bad movie.  This is a must-have.",Pretty Woman VHS

It is, however, entertaining to see Frankie Muniz take on the role of a 13 year old pathological liar who needs to earn back the trust of his parents after repeatedly being unable to submit an English literature paper to avoid summer school.  The reason for this delinquency is Marty Wolf, a grown up version of what Frankie would be if he doesn't change his ways soon.  Marty is the world's biggest liar, and when he comes across Frankie's English paper and goes off to create the year's hottest film based on the story, Frankie wants revenge.  So together with his best friend, Amanda Biele, they set off for Hollywood in search of an apology from Marty which eventually turned out to be an all-out revenge against him (as there are many others who have come across his rude, insensitive and evil path).

437467,"After the Alien series was nearly ruined by the dreadful Alien 3, director Jean-Pierre Jeunet tried to breathe new life into the series as he takes the helm in Alien Resurrection, the fourth film in the long running series.  Ripley (Sigourney Weaver, looking badass as possible) is resurrected hundreds of years into the future through cloning techniques, and so had the Alien queen she was impregnated with in Alien 3.  But through a mishap in the experiment, she has gained some special abilities, and a bad attitude.  A ship of space pirates soon arrives, and of course we all know what happens next.  Weaver, as usual, is great in her role, but the rest of the cast is so-so.  Winona Ryder's talent is wasted in her role, and her ""relationship"" with Ripley isn't very convincing.  Ron Pearlman, Michael Wincott, Brad Dourif, and Dan Hedaya were good choices, though it would have been nice to see Wincott in the movie for longer than he was.  Now onto the Aliens themselves: we get to see some of the Aliens in CGI effect, and it looks a lot better than it did in Alien 3, but for some reason, they just don't feel creepy anymore, they're just not scary like they were in the first two films.  Not to mention that the ""Newborn"" Alien, a hybrid of the Alien and human chromosomes, is a disappointment as well, and the hokey ending seals up this package.  But there are a few good points: the direction is nicely done, it seems Jeunet tried to reproduce Ridley Scott's claustrophobic feel to the film, and he nearly succeds, and the special effects used when the Newborn is dispatched are nice touches as well.  All in all, Alien Resurrection isn't as bad as Alien 3 was, but with another film rumored to be in the works, all the credibility and innovation the series once had is quickly fading.",Alien Resurrection VHS

A good, original comedy, with a great story, and even inspired me a bit. Being 18 years old, I am surronded every day with enormous pressures and questions racing through my mind, and I was always thinking of a way I could just, spill them out. In this movie, Shawn feels the same way after his friend dies, and then he finds a book, reads it to death, and decides he wants to be a writer. After I saw this, I thought, ""Maybe that's what I need to do to get my problems out!"", and sure enough, I write all the time now, and I think I might want to be a writer! Nothing helps your troubles more than spilling them out on a piece of paper :)The good message that I got out of this movie was that going to one place you want to go to isn't the only way you can be the person you want to be. Just as Shawn's girlfriend said in the movie: ""I am sorry you didn't get into Stanford, but if you think that going there is the only way you can be the person you want to be, then I just feel sorry for you."" And, on top of all that, it was just RELATIVE to me- I could relate to Shawn's character so well it was just, weird- really made me feel good in thinking that I am not alone :)Ok, ok, enough with the serious stuff in this movie- this also has a TON of funny parts- Jack Black is HILLARIOUS, and Chevy Chase & Ben Stiller make great cameos!

It has been around 13 weeks, I'm told, and it reached our unreachable neighborhood.It was fun and funny, though the jokes were rather standard Greek clich&eacute;s, or pre-conceptions of Greek-American families; daddy too conservative to allow daughter (now pushing thirty) to date any other male than a Greek; Greek brothers and sisters, a ""Greek"" mother (played by Elaine Kazan who is black), Greek aunts, dozens of cousins, an little bundle of a grandmother, daffy and senile who still thinks the Turks are after her, and other such absolutely ridiculous situations. Of Course Toula, the daughter, inevitably meets an American young man she likes, breaks loose from the tightness of the family restaurant, where she is a waitress, open a travel bureau (""Olympus""), and eventually she becomes liberated.The two families--the American and the Greek--are studies in contrast, and both caricatures. It works at a certain level, the jokes keep tumbling from the mouths of innocents, the music is good, there is some dancing (inevitable in all things Greeks), and even a Zorba's diner (also inevitable) and testament to the lingering influence of the movie Zorba the Greek, which does not mean that the movie is anywhere as serious as that; in fact, it is a romantic comedy that, despite all the misunderstandings and little innocent brawls, ties nicely together, for there is nothing unpleasant, no ugly scenes anywhere, just good-hearted fun.Fresh, and innovative because of that quality, so lacking in today's blockbuster nothings that populate the screens these days.

Has anyone heard of the Medici's?). These fans of the film gleefully point to the film as some kind of indictment of the american dream. It is nothing of the sort. It is the indictment of one man, a fictional character who never existed. Any attempt to condemn the real life Hearst because of the film &quot;Kane&quot; is grossly unfair. For one thing, Heart's mistress, Marion Davies, was a talented comedienne (See the video &quot;Show People&quot;) not the no-talent dummy portrayed in the film.

565477,"The Dune miniseries makes many deviations from the novel, but everything has the right feel.  Action scenes take up a relatively small portion of the movie and character development is correctly assigned the highest priority.  The miniseries is willing to slow down for important conversations, but it never loses its momentum.  The use of three episodes allows the viewer to see palace intrigue unfold into deadly traps and all the smaller conflicts build up to the final battle.  The ending has more meaning when a long journey leads to it.It surprised me, though, that even this new version was barely a summary of the book.  Thufir Hawat and Duncan Idaho were almost left out.  CHAOM and a few other important organizations in galactic politics were entirely ommitted.A few other gripes:  There were some moments in the dialogue between Paul and Jessica that just didn't work.  Some of the special effects were questionable; particularly a few of the desert backgrounds and especially the little mouse.  I am convinced that no movie can completely capture the grandeur of the book, but these are about all the complaints I can list...  Except that Paul is maybe just a little too cool with his spiky hair.The good aspects far outnumber the bad.  The palaces of the Corrinos, Atreides, and Harkonnens are portrayed beautifully and the lighting captures the mood of each location.  The casting choices are excellent.  The Baron is his fat floating self, Feyd is dangerous, clever, and conceited, Duke Leto is somber and stalwart to the end,  Jessica is loving and coldly calculating at the same time, and Chani is exotically beautiful.  The audience watches as Paul himself grows from a pampered Duke's son into a battle hardened leader.The battle scenes, with their close up sword fighting, are a triumph.  The two toughest armies in the galaxy fight to the death and the result is impressive.  The one-on-one duels are even more spectacular.Even the sound track is well done.  On Dune there is the Arabic theme backed with drums.  In emperor's palace, where blue evening light floods through the windows, there are the pompous strings in the background.  In the red lit halls of the Harkonnens there is a cold metallic sound to set the mood.Overall, I was greatly impressed by John Harrison's version.  Though there are some flaws, I see the miniseries as a grand redemption after the abomination of David Lynch's Dune.  To pay homage, I have enthusiastically added the Dune miniseries to my collection.",Frank Herbert's Dune TV Miniseries  VHS

499886,"In a fine performance which showcased his famous voice, Ronald Colman plays A.J. Raffles, a famed British cricket player who is also the &quot;Amateur Cracksman&quot; an equally famous criminal who constantly eludes Scotland Yard. Based upon the 1899 novel THE AMATEUR CRACKSMAN by Ernest William Hornung, the cast includes Kay Francis as Lady Gwen Manders (later played by Olivia de Havilland in the inferior 1939 version starring David Niven), the now-forgotten Frances Dade and, as Lady Kitty Melrose, Alison Skipworth. The direction of this film was done by two men: the French D'Arrast was fired by Goldwyn after endless bickering; he was replaced by George Fitzmaurice.  This film received almost unanimously favourable reviews when it was released in 1930; both Samuel Goldwyn and Ronald Colman benefitted by the advent of sound in the movies: Goldwyn would produce some of the finest, most prestigious films in Hollywood, and Colman would make women swoon with his perfectly modulated English speaking voice (he could also act as well).",Raffles VHS

705064,"You probably either love or hate episodes 25 and 26 of the show-- there's little middle ground. Personally I take the latter viewpoint, so I approached the movie with caution. Actually I saw it on a borrowed fan-sub, which was probably a good thing since I came away disappointed. It's not that I totally hated this movie-- it's certainly more entertaining than the final two episodes-- but there's really nothing new here. If you hated the final episodes and you want this movie for a slightly more normal ending, then stay away. The first part starts kind of like a regular episode with lots of fighting, but it seems to lack any sense of build-up or emotion (the fighting is pretty cool). The second part is sort of like the last two episodes except not quite as boring (more action). It still seems mostly nonsensical or off the plot subject, though. The religious symbolism is heavier than ever before here, and I never really got the impression that it was part of the show at all. On a more technical note, the animation and artwork are good-- whether or not you like the movie this probably won't disappoint.I guess some people are just attuned to love this kind of anime. I'm not one of them, and if you hated the last two episodes there's no way you'll enjoy this. However if you loved those episodes (or even just thought they had something going), if you loved the religious symbolism, then you should definitely consider this movie.",N/A

""Honey, do you remember that summer down in the country when I slaughtered half the population of a village for breaking and entering? You suffered a bit of that yourself. Do you remember how I left you alone in the house to take the crazy guy home and forget all about that guy who only had a bit of his foot blown off and so was probably still alive and dangerous? I think they call it a plot hole, sugar. Say, this pasta is great."" Mind you, their relationship would have been hard pressed to have survived all that, so grandchildren would have been an unlikely prospect.This film sticks out like a sore thumb even for the Seventies. There's no film quite like it. Incredibly, it has only just been cleared in the UK by the film classification board after years of banning despite once being freely available. I have a video copy. I'm embarrassed to report that the board consultated a couple of psychologists as to whether they thought the rape scene might be harmful to the public. I love democracy, don't you? An un-elected body consulting a profession that can't even agree if there is such a thing as personality disorder or an Oedipus complex to decide for millions what they can and can't see certainly takes the proverbial dog biscuit. Luckily for us, quack central past the scene as not harmful. Yes, but what if you already have a personality disorder? Still, you can now speculate about the notorious scene for yourself, soon. Was she faking it because she feared for her life? Did she have split loyalties right from the start? Gosh, I'm not touching it with a bargepole. The film, I mean. No, that's cowardly. Basically, when confronted by a bully you have two options, one of which is appeasement. Amy takes this option and is then taught a traumatic lesson. Still not willing to confront the lesson she attempts to repeat her mistake until her husband stops her and spells out what would happen to the pair of them if she carries out this option. Only when finally forced to take up arms does she qualitively learn. Is this the only way ultimately to deal with terrorists? There's little doubting the director's perspective, but what's yours?The atmosphere of Straw Dogs is horrible from the start. I rarely watch it because of this. The editing is brilliant, the script strong and it lacks that distancing effect you get with most films. It is uncomfortably real. Should this have been the film to be titled THE OMEN? The brother grabbing his sister by the neck as they watch the couple in the cottage get into bed. The trap nearly springing on Charlie as the workmen try to put it on the cottage wall. Aspects of a cowboy movie filter through creating a bizarre atmosphere. Preposterous plotting means the film is best viewed as a strange nightmare, with human beings reduced to and even turning into rats before our very eyes.",Straw Dogs VHS
273252,"It's funny what growing up can do for your outlook on films. I saw Return of the Living Dead when I was 14, with my best buddy Bryan. We were both VERY disappointed with the comedic aspects of the film, and trashed it to anyone who would listen. Now I'm 31, and I've come to the conclusion that TROTLD is a classic. A minor classic, but a classic nonetheless.A semi-sequel to the legendary Night of the Living Dead (It shares the same writer), TROTLD gives us this scenario: After a chemical spill that resulted in the incident which Night of the Living Dead is based on, the Army seals up the living cadavers and ships them off for study. Being the Army, S--T happens; The cannisters are misplaced for 15 years in a Medical supply warehouse, where they are accidentally breached by two dim-bulb employees (Thom Matthews and the HILARIOUS James Karen, who provides most of the films laughs); After overcoming a re-animated frozen corpse, and being dosed with the chemical themselves, they bop over to the nearby CEMETARY (You see where this is going..?) to ask their buddy Ernie (Don Calfa) to help them cremate the dismembered bits. Soon those ashes are seeding the rainclouds, creating a downpour of zombie-makin' goodness!The script is lively and fun; We even get to see Zombies that run, talk, use radios to call for more victims.....Very original stuff! It's amazing to see what they were able to accomplish with such a small budget. The disc includes both standard and widescreen formats (WATCH WIDESCREEN!!!!), commentary by Director Dan O'Bannon and Production Designer William Stout, a Designing the Dead featurette, Theatrical trailers and TV spots, William Stout's gorgeous design art, and coolest of all, the box cover glows in the dark!!

699185,"As Shakespeare might have said - this film is full of sound and fury, but ultimately signifies nothing.In order to understand this film to best effect - like why there are two Christmas trees in the hospital, and why we keep seeing rows and loops of multicoloured lights - you really need to watch the 'Special Features' before you watch the main feature. Apart from over-using the contents of the basic trailer, these ""extras"" are genuinely interesting, useful and relevant.The basic problem with the whole project, as far as I could tell, was that any attempt to raise the film to a metaphysical level (listen to the comments by Richard Gere (star), Will Patton (lead support) and Mark Pellington (director) in the Interviews feature) was effectively kyboshed by the need to produce what somebody thought would be a marketable product.Despite the frequent claims that the story is ""based on truth"" the fact is that it is LOOSELY related to certain highly subjective reports of ""the truth"" as set out in John Keel's book ""The Mothman Prophecies"".I mention this because whilst the film uses the idea that the Mothman, or Mothmen, gave detailed warnings - ""99 will die"", ""disaster on the River Ohio"", etc., the message from John Keel is that the prophetic element is IMPLICIT rather than EXPLICIT. That is to say, Keel seems (in the interviews on this disc) to be saying that SIGHTINGS of mothmen imply looming disaster wherever they are seen, but he mentions NO examples of direct communication with human beings, and certainly NO specific prophecies.As to the film itself, it is unquestionably technically ""clever"", but it is a clever presentation of pretty hackneyed material.Gere, as bland as ever, is distraught over the death of his wife in a car accident two years earlier (the crash provides the prologue to the main action).After somehow travelling 400 miles in an hour or so - at the end of which he loses all electrical functions in car and mobile phone (this typical UFO-associated phenomena is never fully explored) - he meets up with Gordon Smallwood (Will Patton), who is apparently being pestered by a Mothman, and Police Officer Connie Mills (Laura Lynney), with whom Gere then proceeds to deliver a ""poor man's"" version of ""The X-Files""'s Mulder and Scully for the rest of the film.Gere has his own interpretation of the film in general, and his part in particular, which he describes in the interview section of the disc and which certainly helps to explain the way he plays his part.Unfortunately this interpretation is never allowed full rein, and the film comes down to a fairly straight drive to the final Silver Bridge collapse and consequent loss of life which are depicted the last 10 minutes of the film and which are the only details, as far as I could tell, that were genuinely based on ""true events"".In the final analysis this is JUST passable as comic book level entertainment - but unless you're the sort of person who thinks that the Bermuda Triangle stories are pure fact, DON'T expect to get anything meaningful out of it. The basic material just doesn't measure up.",N/A

494360,"I first saw THE LEGEND OF HELL HOUSE on TV probably a year or two after it played in theatres. I was all of 12 years old, sitting in my darkened living room, when the opening frames of the movie display a ""quotation"" from an ""expert"" on paranormal phenomena that says something or other about the investigations into life after death. I literally thought I was watching a documentary as the opening scene of the house and subsequent set pieces were time-stamped with the date and time. This still gives me the sense today of watching a non-fiction account and not a superbly suspenseful film!The soundtrack is totally electronic and repetitive, but completely effective and unsettling throughout the movie. There are sparse interjections of minor chords played on what sounds like a church organ--just the right Gothic touch!The casting is highlighted by the performances of both Roddy McDowall and Pamela Franklin. Roddy McDowall plays the lone survivor of the last attempt to solve the riddle of the house's evil spirits. Pamela Franklin is a spiritual not physical medium who immediately senses all is not right with the house and its prior ""occupants."" Rounding out the foursome are Clive Revill who plays the highly skeptical scientist who's determined to explain away the evil with good, old-fashioned scientific investigation. Gayle Hunnicutt plays his wife, Ann, who accompanies him on this ghost hunt, and is soon involved in the whole matter more than she could ever have imagined.The house itself is really the fifth player or character in this tale of malevolence and subtle terror. The physical setting of the house, shrouded in clouds and seemingly permanent English fog, is most disturbing. Inside there are many dark hallways and passages that hold yet undiscovered secrets. Interestingly, Miss Tanner's (Pamela Franklin's character) room is papered in red-velvet cloth-- a very passionate color. More than one scene of ghostly violence occurs upon her person in that room. The scariest scene, even now that I'm much older, is the first ""sitting"" wherein Miss Tanner's experience is quite unusual for a spiritual medium. You'll have to watch it to know what I mean.I get goosebumps just writing this review, the movie is still that chilling in my mind.

437421,"Ya know, it's almost like the writers from the Friday the 13th, and Nightmare on Elm Street got together to make an unnecessary 4th installment to a perfectly good trilogy. I'm not even sure why I went to see this movie, other than I had been a fan for so long. ... Ripley died rather horribly, and anyone who sees someone fall into a pit of molten lava (or lead if you like) while an alien bursts out of that same persons chest, it stands to reason they've been well and thoroughly killed. But through the amazing, and poorly portrayed, miracle of cloning (not to mention financial backing from the Hollywood garbage factory) Ripley has returned. Ah science, what can't it do in the hands of poor writing? But she's a lot more animal like in her behavior, and doesn't play well with others. Enter a team of morons whose only real purpose in the film is to run away screaming from the aliens who kill them in increasingly elaborate ways, which ultimately begs the viewer to ask themselves this question: How long has this been on? Ah, but a story is not complete without a plot twist or two, and they add so much dimension to a story; or so I used to think. Winona Ryder is an Android, and so those big wet eyes are in fact the work of an engineer .... She's an Android with feelings though, and in an attempt at character development, akin to a child writing Shakespeare with a broken crayon, She must overcome her debilitating alienation (no pun intended) from her crew of moron/alien chew toys. The crowning achievement is the cross breeding of an alien with a human, once again provided through the miracle of scientific ignorance. Strangely enough, this new uber-alien enjoys all the benefits, and none of the weaknesses of human or alien. ...By the end you'll want those 90 or so minutes of your life back, but Movie Theaters don't give refunds.This movie is terrible.

88800,"I held off on watcing the Exorcist for quite some time because anytime someone says a horror movie is so scary and makes people puke I know they don't know what good horror is (check out some of the classic itallian horror movies by Fulci! sure the acting isn't the best but it's a horror movie for crying out loud and Fulci is the master of gore). Maybe this film was something to be scared of back in 1973 but some 30 years later this film doesn't do much to scare me. I will admit that the images of Captin Howdy are quite creepy and his time on screen, which are a few seconds makes him one of the most creepiest horror creatures in history. The acting in this film is ok, Linda Blair does an amazing job for a 12 year old in her first major role but the other acting isn't the greatest. I also found there to be way too much dialouge for a so-called scary movie (there were way more scenes without Blair than there were with her). I also got annoyed at how they showed a scene with Blair and then not even 2 minutes later the scene was over (most of her scenes lasted under 5 minutes except for her excorcism scenes in the end) Being one of the most hyped and talked about horror films around i'm left confused after viewing this. What exactally made people run from the theater screaming or throw up or pass out? This film is very controversial I will admit and that was one of the great things about it but the movie in no way is one of the scariest ever. I will also admit that the make-up is excellent for a movie and the transfer to dvd makes this film look brand new and if it wasn't for the clothing and hairstyles i'd never believe that this was made in 1973! After finally viewing this I really can't see how films like The Sixth Sense (pg-13 horror...give me a break!)and the Others even resemble this film or can be compaired to this. Sure they aren't your typical slasher horror films but in no way are they good horror films. The Blair Witch Project has been called the new Exorcist and to me that movie is scarier because I like 10 minutes from Burkittsville and have been there many times and the town is very creepy at nighttime.Do yourself a favor and go out and rent or buy some real horror classics that will really scare you and make you throw up. Try checking out Zombie, Cannibal Holocaust, The Beyond, New York Ripper, Hellrasier, Hellbound Hellrasier 2, Dawn of the Dead. and Day of the Dead. Also check out two of the most terrifying horror films ever, Night of the living dead and Bela Lugosi's Dracula! Both don't have the gore but the mixture of black and white and creepiness make them two of the greatest of all time.The Exorcist is a decent movie but in noway one of the greatest horror films of all time. Sure it pushed the envelope and was something huge for it's time but that was 30 years ago and so much more gore has come out since then that will really scare the hell out of you!",N/A

Anytime a movie is based on a true story, you know that things have been fudged to make the movie more interesting.

It is also a story in the tradition of Orwell's _1984_. The difference is that a corporate totalitarian state and not a socialist totalitarian state is described. The results are essentially the same, mind-numbing conformity and a tiny elite in control.When you see the absolute conformity of this society backed by random and ubiquitous genetic testing, you cannot fail to see the direction that our own society is heading. The dictatorship of I.Q. Testing, Personality Testing, Drug Testing, combined with employment records, educational transcripts, social security numbers, green cards, and a national ID card, all essentially equals Gattica (i.e. you are classified and graded as a commodity and are locked into that classification for life.)

739877,"When I first heard that the second installment of the Harry Potter series would be darker, moodier, and creepier I had my doubts, after all why would a children's story do something creepy? Who cares?! They did it and it was amazing!I'm an avid horror fanatic, and having classic horror elements in this film drastically upped the enjoyability of the film for me, from the moment Harry starts hearing ""voices"" to when he starts talking to snakes in the snake language, to the blood text threats written on the walls. Granted this is still completely appropriate for most kids, but the movie succeeded in grabbing my attention, and keeping me glued while the mystery surrounding the Chamber of Secrets was unraveled. The first movie was great, but this movie surpasses it on many levels. I am so eager to find out what happens next that I may actually read the third book, as I don't have the patients to wait until Summer 2004 for the next Potter film.My only complaint is that two of my favorite characters, Herminie, and Hagwit (I don't know how to spell their names) were both seriously under used. I understand the book was the same way. I would liked to have seen Herminie have a more prominate role in this film, but I was also grateful to see Ron have a more prominate role in the film, and even some actual heroism on the part of Mr. Potter himself. This film was far less reliant on sidekicks and incidental heroics than the previous film, which had some of the same sort bizarre coincidental antics that Star Wars Episode 1 suffered from. Seeing Harry actually fighting, using spells himself, rather than being reliant on the aid of others proved to me that Harry is indeed worthy of the hero status that had been placed on him, rather than just a poor little rich kid with all the right resources, and amazing side kicks to do all the work for him that some sudden critics have been claiming him to be.Certainly a little too dark for the under 5 age group, but otherwise an amazing film that I recommend for most people 6 and up.

Robin Williams made a winning transition from comedy to drama in ""Dead Poets Society,"" but there simply isn't enough plot, nor enough interesting characters, to make this a good movie. At best, it is sadly average, given the potential of its above average cast.Still, there are winning moments, such as the now-famous ""Oh Captain, my captain"" desk-standing scene. I've heard some people comment that teachers like the one Williams portrays are better left out of the classroom. I would actually prefer to see more creativity like his brought into the schools. If only the writers and director had employed some of that creativity themselves...",N/A

91433,"Tim Burton does a fantastic job of transposing his dark, nightmarish vision of Gotham City onto the widescreen in this Superhero effort. The cast includes the top-notch acting talents of Micheal Keaton, Jack Palance and Jack Nicholson. The special effects are well done, the sound of the Batmobile is terrific & the Bat cave looks like something out of Dante's INFERNO.So what is the problem, you ask? Why the mediocre rating? The answer is: Michael Keaton. That Keaton is a terrific actor is not in dispute. In fact, he is one of my favorite current actors. The problem lies not in his acting ability, but in his physique.See, Keaton is even smaller than I am, and I am certainly nobody's 1st choice to play Bruce Wayne. In the comic book lore, Bruce Wayne is always depicted as this hulking figure whom you just don't want to mess with. Keaton doesn't fit that criteria (and neither do I!).Tobey Maguire is a small fellow, but he made a terrific SPIDERMAN. That's because SPIDERMAN has genuine Super-powers; it does not matter if he's on the puny side. Batman does not have Super-powers. His crime fighting ability rests upon his working out in the gym (probably 3-4 hours a day), his cunning and his gadgets / inventions. This film focuses mostly on the gadgets, mostly due to the fact that Keaton is not believable as a guy who can throw people around.Truth be told, Val Kilmer and George Clooney did not match my vision of Bruce Wayne, either. Both were more believable than Keaton, but when I think of Bruce Wayne I traditionally think of a Dolph Lundgren type physique. Of course, Clooney also had the misfortune of being in by far the worst of the BATMAN movies.On the upside, Keaton's acting ability does account for some measure of why this movie is worth seeing. He does a splendid job of portraying an emotionally tormented man who leads the double life of ordinary person & Superhero. Furthermore, Nicholson is outstanding as Batman's arch-enemy, the Joker.So, all-in-all, I rate this film a 3 star effort. Certainly worth seeing, but with serious shortcomings in the casting department.",N/A
485980,"The 1971 film ""Two-Lane Blacktop"" is arguably the best of the late 60s, early 70s existential road film genre (including ""Easy Rider,"" ""Vanishing Point"" and ""Electra Glide in Blue""). Director Monte Hellman's stark, at times unyeilding examination of American alienation is brilliant simply because of its refusal to pander to an audience undoubtedly looking for the commercial release of an exciting car chase.There is a race in ""Two-Lane Blacktop,"" though it seems to end almost before it begins. There are extraordinary muscle cars as well, including a souped up '55 Chevy contrasted with a new Pontiac GTO. But Two-Lane Blacktop is a character study, even though the characters are not people we would particularly like to know.The three main characters, haunted lost souls void of identity and emotion, are played by James Taylor, Dennis Wilson and Warren Oates. Taylor and Wilson silently cruise the backroads of America looking for the next race in their 55' Chevy. They eventually meet Oates, a chattering, nervous man involved in some kind of middle-age crisis while picking up hitchikers in his GTO. These men decide to race cross country, but eventually lose interest.Throw into this uneasy mix a young hitchiker played by Laurie Bird. She jumps back and forth between these three men, holding off their awkward advances, eventually realizing their emotionless lives are headed down an endless highway without destination.""Two-Lane Blacktop"" is a morose study of men perpetually lost on the backroads of a nameless American landscape. They are hovering ghosts, void of identity, forever searching for a meaning which cannot be found. There are no easy truths or answers in Hellman's complex odyssey. These men are trapped, their cars serving as rolling coffins, redemption seemingly around the next bend, inexorably moving further and further away.The time period of the early 1970s and the scratchy period music moaning from the AM radio, combined with the faceless gas stations and roadside diners of numerous small towns, all contribute to the overall effect of Hellman's dark character study. ""Two-Lane Blacktop"" is one of the finest American films no one has ever heard of.",Two-Lane Blacktop
701221,"I haven't seen ""Alien 3"" since it's theatrical release, but I'm inclined to think that I'd watch that again than ""Panic Room.""Fincher fans will no doubt love ""Panic Room"" because surely, you can't go wrong with Fincher. And you can't, cause he's not the problem here. In fact, he deserves kudos for taking up a film with so many obstacles: namely, a single location, a small number of characters, and a restricted period of time in which the story takes place. But all these challenges are ones that should've been overcome at the scripting stage. Fincher isn't fighting an up-hill battle. He's trudging through the remains of a dead script.Fincher's strength - his dark and innovative visual style - gets completely overtaken by the boring, simple, unmotivated screenplay by Koepp that has several crippling weaknesses:1) laughable dialogue with too much reliance on expletives and hokey name-calling2) ineffective build-up of tension due to drawn-out, somewhat ridiculous plot devices3) inability to believe Foster and her daughter are in any real danger because of the presence of Whitaker's character4) a non-engaging cat-and-mouse game because too little is happening - people are just waiting for their opponents' next move5) minimal character development that offers no surprisesThat last weakness is the Achilles heel of ""Panic Room."" In Fincher's previous films, the twists and surprises come not in plot, but in character. ""Fight Club"" and ""Se7en"" pay off at the end because of what is revealed about Tyler and John Doe. In ""Panic Room,"" not only are the characters one-dimensional, they're also extraneous. Junior serves no practical purpose in the story - he could've simply stepped in at the middle (to bring out Raoul's wild side) and stepped out. Raoul himself doesn't do much up until that point. And Foster's daughter has no effect on the events whatsoever. She would've served the same purpose (namely, as the object of Foster's maternal instinct) if she were comatose or an infant baby.But bland characters do not doom a film. It can still be enjoyable if there's a a nice plot twist or two. Alas, there's not even a cheap surprise in store for you at the end of ""Panic Room."" And that's a shame because the premise sets up an intriguing question: what's in the panic room that these thieves are so anxious to get? Early in the film, Leto states to Whitaker (and the audience) what's supposed to be there. And guess what. The very thing they expect is exactly what they find. Yawn.Because the screenplay is so thin and lacking, Fincher's signature camera tricks are reduced to gimmicks that fail to further the plot or create any tension. For example, it's painfully obvious that the camera enters the keyhole for no purpose other than to point out ""Look! We went into a keyhole, isn't that a hoot?""With Fincher at the helm, ""Panic Room"" should've been an innovative, genre-defying film driven by strong, memorable characters, instead of the run-of-the-mill thriller that it is.",N/A

525344,"Actually, my copy of the DVD is Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone. (The Philosopher's stone is a real medieval legend. The title of the book and movie were changed for American audiences. British and Canadian versions have slightly different scenes were the characters say the proper name of the stone.)I have to admit, as I saw the movie I had a big smile on my face. I particularly like Ron &amp; Hermione and Hagrid, although Daniel Radcliffe makes a good Harry. Maybe a little too good. In the book, Harry is not perfect. His mistakes have been sanitized in the film.I found most of the joy I had in watching this film came straight from the book. And overall, the movie is fairly faithful. Maybe a little too much. Peter Jackson's LOTR re-imagined the novel to make it work better on film. At times, the Harry Potter film just seems like a plot summary of the book. Good -- but it doesn't quite sparkle. There is magic in the film, but it is borrowed from JK Rowling's book. LOTR creates its own magic.I also didn't like the Quidditch effect as it seemed confusing and the characters didn't mesh with the background.As for the DVD, it's nice looking. The special features -- well, I've seen discs with a lot more, but there's a good assortment here. Kids might have a lot of fun trying to find the stone and Deleted Scenes. Adults might want to just cut to the chase.Nice that the DVD has the sorting hat song. I wish the film had kept it.All in all, it's an enjoyable way to spend a few hours.

I have one more prediction: After reading this review, you'll discover something about the Manchurian Candidate that you didn't already know.I liked this movie, though some of Sinatra's acting was a bit cheese-filled. And don't ask me why Janet Leigh got so hot for big-eared Sinatra. He was a mess when she was falling for him. I guess she just wanted to take care of a mess. Lots of women with low self esteem have that prob.The DVD has great picture and the special features are pretty cool, though the director's commentary slyly skated over one important snipped of miserable editing that I thought should've been pointed out:In the dinner scene between what's his face, his girlfriend, and her senator father, they're laughing at the table while eating dinner. He picks up a forkful of meat and puts it in his mouth...then the film REWINDS! He takes the fork of food OUT OF HIS MOUTH and it goes back to the plate, then the film FORWARDS again! Once again, the same piece of meat goes back into his mouth! This is clearly a case of wanting to run the scene for about 30 seconds, but they only had 10 seconds worth of film to deal with. I have never been so insulted! Watch that scene if you own the movie. Buy the movie if you don't own it so you can watch that scene.This is a really good movie with a great ending.

This is not to say that Mr. Jamieson is wrong, perhaps he should have written the screenplay for this movie, perhaps he should have directed it too as then we would all watch it and know what was happening. Unfortunately for us this film was not written and directed by David Jamieson, it was written and directed by David Lynch, and it shows because, like most of Lynch's other movies, it [is terrible]. Oh sure, the art-house crowd [is delighted] when Lynch [makes] another movie, but then most of these people wouldn't know a good movie... So directors like Lynch can make a decent living by cranking out completely stupid and incomprehensible movies that appeal to these [people].

594084,"The first Austin Powers movie was hilarious.  The second movie basically recycled the same jokes, but I laughed anyway, probably because I was reminded at how good the first movie was.  It was comedy by association.  I'm sorry, but I can't give this third movie, Goldmember, the same sort of pity laugh.  There were a few mild chuckles here and there, but it doesn't even come close to reaching the bar set by its two predecessors.I'd tell you about the plot of the movie, but I couldn't remember what it was even when I walked out of the theater.  Beyonce Knowles did a solid acting job, but it was fairly easy to tell that she was acting in her first movie.  Unlike Elizabeth Hurley and Heather Graham in the previous movies, Beyonce doesn't serve as Austin's love interest, so there isn't any of the playing hard-to-get that viewers found so funny in the first two.  She's strictly business, which isn't very funny.  There's also a new character added to this movie called Goldmember.  He's a disco-dancing rollerskater who peels off and eats pieces of his own dry skin.  Disgusting?  Yes.  Funny?  No.  And, of course, there's Dr. Evil, Fat Bastard, Mini-Me, and all the rest of the usual supporting cast.  They each have their funny moments, but not many.I know several screen writers, and they all say that every scene in a movie is supposed to mean something.  In this case, every scene should either provide some sort of comedy or advance the plot of the story.  There were several scenes in the movie that didn't do either of these.  They were just there holding the movie and its audience in limbo.  Everyone in Hollywood is under pressure to meet deadlines and cut costs, and it was very evident that this pressure played a major part in the making of this movie.  I'm sure the movie studio knew that people were going to see this movie regardless of quality just because the previous movies were successful, so there was no incentive to make a good movie.I have to admit that I'm a big Austin Powers fan, and if they make a fourth movie I'll definitely go see it no matter how good or bad it is.

570527,"One would think by reading the majority of the critical reviews, CHARLIE'S ANGELS is a great movie adaptation of the 1970s television show. Well, don't think that. CHARLIE'S ANGELS is NOT a great adaptation of the television show in which it was based. Yes, the movie has lots of jiggle and action and the plot is believable (though it's a rip off of MISSION:IMPOSSIBLE). However, the movie is totally uninspired.Cameron Diaz and Drew Barrymore are the only people in the film who actually look like they enjoyed making the movie. Everyone else in the movie has this look of ""what have I gotten myself into"" on their faces, especially Lucy Liu and Bill Murray. Actually, Murray and Liu spend most of the movie scowling (suggesting that the rumors of bad blood between those two were true). I'm not surprised Murray does not wish to return as Bosley in the sequel.As mentioned before, the film contains a great deal of action. Too much action to be precise. Kung Wu action sequences and bullet time work well in films like THE MATRIX where those movements are essential to the plot; CROUCHING TIGER, HIDDEN DRAGON which is basically a mystical modern legend; and in SHREK because it's a cartoon. However, as cool as those action sequences are, they don't work in every action movie. Those sequences have been exploited and are being overused, often taking any sense of empathy away from otherwise good movies. Those Kung Wu moves were used so much in CHARLIE'S ANGELS that I started laughing every time the Angels were fighting.I was young enough to watch the last few seasons of ""Charlie's Angels"" when it aired on television. Granted, the show didn't have the best writing in the world and is best known for its jiggle factor. However, the show never really was campy. CHARLIE'S ANGELS the movie is total camp, making fun of itself throughout the picture. That's so sad because the film could have been so good.

Outside of the demented imaginations of liberal pinko prevert screenwriters there is no allusion to contextual rectitude. (Thanks for the commentary guys.)  Let's just take a look at the sordid view of our society that this movie propagates.  They expect us to actually believe in: greedy, amoral, meglomaniacal real estate agents trouncing through suburbia like hyenas in heat; precociously neurotic high school kids swearing, selling drugs to each other and obsessing over forbidden sex; disillusioned, middle-aged men fantasizing about over-sexed, buffed out teenage girls; decent and intelligent gay men trying to get along with their neighbors; fascistic, closet-case marine corps officers abusing their wives and children; and finally, the offspring of decadent, pathologically materialistic, dysfunctional, middle class parents dreaming of a world without hypocrisy and social Darwinist oppression.  I mean, ask yourself, honestly:  IN WHAT KIND OF UNIVERSE DO THESE THINGS HAPPEN?!!!On second thought, don't ask yourself.

677000,"Far be it from me to criticize other's taste in film, my own is pretty eclectic.  But I really can't figure out some of these reviews.  Moulin Rouge is sheer entertainment - exhuberent and lovely. When I saw it in a crowded (sold out)theatre, the audience was so appreciative that they applauded between numbers and gave the film a seven-minute standing ovation at the end.Film is a collaborative art, not only in its production but in its performance.  What one sees in the film is, ultimately, what one brings to the film. My only explanation for the few bad reviews, therefore, is that perhaps the video incarnation of Moulin Rouge is somehow a less rich experience than the theatrical performance.  Seeing movies in solitude is a great way to study them (left brain activity) but a very poor way to enjoy them (right brain activity).  Film critics see movies in solitude - usually in special screenings arranged before the premiere.  Film lovers, though, enjoy the electricity and excitement of a shared experience.  Love is only love when it is shared.I have never been particularly fond of Nicole Kidman, but she shines here, reminding me of a young, beautiful and talented Ann Margaret.  When Kidman moved from &quot;Diamonds are a Girl's Best Friend&quot; into &quot;Material Girl&quot; the audience became ecstatic, laughing and applauding the goofy incongruity which, nevertheless, worked.  Ewan McGregor's voice quavers a bit on the high notes, but I think it might be intentional -- after all, those notes mark a high point of emotion. The rest of his singing voice is fine and full.  Both of them are incredibly beautiful to look at and there is palpable chemistry between them.Yes, the story is thin -- but we're talking &quot;fairy tale&quot; here, not Tolstoy - it IS light, airy, weightless, almost. So was Shakespeare's &quot;Midsummer Night's Dream&quot;. It is giddy and sometimes silly, but so is being in love.With the exception of those musicals that moved from stage to screen, few movie musicals have completely original scores.  One of the greatest movie musicals, Singing in the Rain, is COMPLETELY a rehash of older material.  When talkies began and musicals became popular, Warner Brothers bought a huge catalogue of standards and simply recycled them through most of their movie musicals from the early 30's through the late 50's.  Yes, it is a bit disconcerting to hear Elton John and the Beatles (not to mention Madonna) in a turn-of-the-century narrative, but after the initial shock, the fun is infectuous.This is a movie ABOUT love . . . and it is a movie TO love.  I love it, and I hope you will too.  Valentine's Day is coming up, and Moulin Rouge has my vote for the best &quot;Valentine's Day&quot; choice this year. As I mentioned, Love is only Love when it is shared -- so be sure to share the experience of watching this film with someone you love.",N/A
163839,"This is one of my favorite movies that I can watch over & over, & is just simply hilarious.  Immediately you're introduced to the roommate Stuart's male antics, & I thought Baldwin played the part really well.  How could you forget his disgusting confession to Eddie, ""I just love the smell of her ..."", or him bragging ""Sex...is like pizza...even if it's bad, it's still pretty good!!""  Alex is one of those confused, yet pretentious characters you want to hate, yet end up relating to at the same time, like when she's whining about guys ""who don't give a ... about me"".  So many people want certain qualities in a person in relationships, but then the people they go after are really nothing what they really want...like scary Larry :)  And who couldn't relate to her insecurities, like whining about being fat...even though she's far from it, or warning Eddie not to toy with her emotions.  Eddie, the narrator, is basically just an intellectual who happens to be confused about his sexuality, and often seems to be in deep thought, even when he's not saying anything outloud or to himself.  And I think college, being the ultimate place for self-discovery (if you go to it anyway), couldn't be a better place to set his search.The relationship of Stuart, Eddie & Alex hits me at home, reminding me of the close friendships I've had being inclusive, inhibiting outsiders, making fun of those not in the club cuz they don't get the joke, etc.  Like in the middle of the movie, you meet Stuart's cutesy, air-headed date, & though you feel kinda sorry for her because you wouldn't wanna be made fun of like the way they treated her, you know that most people have done that sort of thing before.  There's also various public scenes displaying their behaviour, & they seem to have no care or remorse for what others think...which brings another good point...they don't CARE what you think of them!!Their relationship gets, as expected, twisted at the end with the threesome, & I think if you were considering doing this (who hasn't at least thought about it at one point), & were concerned with feelings of the persons involved, the shattered friendship afterwards might actually make you think twice.  Then at the end, Eddie reflects by noting how some people are so important one minute, & then gone the next...which is so true.  Even after the 1st time I saw this movie when I was a freshman in college shortly after it came out on video (how ideal, huh?), I got a sense of some points & morals put in the movie, but also set in a very funny & entertaining atmosphere.  Though it does deal a lot with sexual issues, I think it focuses more with personal relations.I dunno what's not to like about this movie, unless it's too sexual for your preference...want more sex, just see American Pie, but Threesome at least goes beyond just sex.  Some of the humor just goes over some people's heads, I think...it's either funny to some people or it isn't...you either get the joke or you don't!!  But if you ask me, it's funny as hell.  And I also agree with another reviewer, you have to be open-minded to appreciate this, or at least allow yourself to be open-minded (like I think I was when I first saw it).  I've seen this countless number of times, but you could probably tell this already...I could quote LOTS more, lol.  It's always good & funny the next time I see it, & also leaves you with a few things to think about too...isn't that what a good movie is about?  If you haven't seen it, you're missing out!!",N/A
712924,"If you are familiar with the wacky but gloriously fun architecture of Gaudi, with all the monuments to his gifts collected in Barcelona, then you will have an inkling of the pleasures in store for you in this little treasure of a film GAUDI AFTERNOON.  Almost as a metaphor for the way life imitates Gaudi's art, this well written, photographed and acted film is so off the beaten track that that it slipped by the major theaters who search for the Big Movies, often neglecting these fine ornaments.  In short, this is a story of an expatriated American, at odds with her own life and family, who settles temporarily in Barcelona to translate a South American novel from Spanish into English.  In the midst of her tedious ad frustrating life pops what appears to be a glamourous femme fatale who hires our bored translator to find her estranged husband.  And that is all the plot you get.  All of the characters she encounters in her tidbit of detective work are uniquely different from what they appear. In the end all turns out well, but it is the getting there that is so much fun!  With actessses such as Judy Davis, Marcia Gay Harden, Lily Taylor, and Juliette Lewis expect the best of work.  These women are gifted comediennes and the director and cinematographer use them as embellishments visually and emotionally and sarcastically to the wondrously photographed architecture of Gaudi. This movie is rich in color, in imagination, in acting, and in joy.  Treat yourself!",Gaudi Afternoon

For me it actually expands on each character, such as sarcasm is sarcasm instead of a funny or dumb line. If you've ever watched a sitcom without a laugh track that originally aired with a laugh track, you'll know what I mean. The laugh track is ON by default, meaning you'll need to turn it off if you change discs (at least on my 5-disc player).The DVD set, through the original release of the season two DVD set, does not contain any extras, such as behind the scenes commentary.The 3-disc DVD set comes in a wonderful keep-case; all plastic.

534739,"Cast Away has some flaws, including having a somewhat weaker third act and over-marketing (if you saw the previews, you might already know the entire plot), however the film is lead by Tom Hanks through most of the film, and I think that if you took the entire second act of the film by itself, you have 5 star movie.Tom Hanks plays a fed-ex man who is always obsessed with time, and over the Christmas break he has to leave his girlfriend to go to Asia.  But, on his way there on the plane, it crashes in the ocean and he winds up on a deserted island with hardly any food and inevitably no future.  All he can survive on is his primal instincts, lessons learned either from boy scouts or 2001 (the movie), or on a few fed-ex supplies.  To see Hanks like this on the island, doing things is amazing enough.  There is one scene in particular where he is creating fire that might be one of the best scenes by itself ever.  The way he shows his eyes, the way the camera shows the fire being made, the face, even the look on the face of his inanimate volleyball Wilson, is extraordinary.  Speaking of which, even though the volleyball which is named Wilson (intentionally, but possibly not) never speaks, it and Hanks give one of the best on-screen duo's in years.  The fact that he can communicate with this lifeless yet quirkily funny sport's object and make it entertaining in some ways similar to Jay and Silent Bob, is just one of the film's triumphs.Overall, not only does Tom Hanks give the best performance of the year, he gives his second best performance of his career.  Bravo to him and every scene on the island for making such a compelling presence, even if the film isn't completely it.",N/A
190963,"...The only good thing about this movie is that the screenwriters actually researched the events in the life of Pilate (Oldman, in a wonderful prformance, as always) which led to his utterly human spinelessness at the Trial of Jesus....Above all, it relies on the Gospel According to Saint Thomas as its source.  This (originally anonymous) Gospel was thrown out of the Canon at one of the first conferences on the Bible.Because it relies on this Gospel, it puts forward the Gnostic heresies which almost all the Epistles (not just Paul's either) at some point rail against.  The entirity of John's letters are to denounce this!I was also offended by the performance of John the Baptist.  At every point, I thought he was going to try and sell me a used car.I would have given this crap no stars, but there was no choice for that.

669669,"For a compilation of Martina McBride's greatest hits, it seems odd to me that six albums worth of music could only produce the eleven videos found on this DVD (two are even listed as ""bonus"" tracks).  Everything on this disc is enjoyable, but I wish there were more songs . . .As with most music DVDs, I purchased this not only as a collector's item, but also to learn more about the artist and what went into creating the music videos.  I give a solid A-rating to the songs and the quality of the videos, with special note to the outstanding imagery and story-telling in ""Independence Day,"" ""Wild Angels,"" ""A Broken Wing,"" ""Love's the Only House,"" and ""Cheap Whiskey.""  I wasn't a big Martina McBride fan before I bought this DVD, but I'm more of one now.Aside from the too-small sampling of videos, a couple other minor disappointments keep me from giving a 5-star rating.  I looked around for any information about who directed the videos, and where and when they were filmed.  All I found (even in the liner notes) was ""various original producers"" and ""various video directors.""  I really thought many of the videos were brilliant; I can't believe there were no credits for them.  Also, the ""Greatest Hits"" CD has many more songs besides those included on the DVD.  I'm not sure what the reasoning was in leaving so many ""hits"" off of the video collection, but I expected that the listed songs would be the same.  Did the missing songs not have videos?The option of watching the tracks with or without the commentary between them is a good feature.  The CMT interview footage with Martina is okay, but some ""behind the scenes"" footage would have added another great dimension that is lacking here.Overall, this is a good DVD that I would recommend to just about anyone, especially fans of Martina.",N/A
590427,"First off, I have to admit that I wasn't originally excited to see a movie that runs for over 2 hours about a mathematician. I guess I just wasn't in the mood. But after seeing the movie, I was so glad I did!. What a movie!. What performances!. It was easily my favorite movie I had seen this past year. Okay, on with the movie. Russell Crowe plays John Forbes Nash Jr., a brilliant mathematician who first began at Princeton University, where he created an incredible economic theory. This got him a MIT professorship as well. But then came a horrible down side. Nash was diagnosed with schizophrenia. The disease made Nash become delusional. Through all this, he did win the Nobel Prize too. The delusion part of Nash's life is what Howard really goes for here in the film. He really gives you a look at the disease and of any mental health problems that hasn't really been done before on the big screen. He did it perfectly with no flaws at all. Mr. Crowe. What can I say?. I have to admit that I'm not a fan of his, but I do respect his work and think he is one of our greatest actors we have working today. He is tremendous. You have never really seen a performance like this before. If you say you have and that it's cliched, as I know some of you out there have, you just didn't get it. Crowe's performance is downright astonishing. Your not watching Crowe. You are watching John Nash. If he doesn't win the Oscar for this, well, then there is no need for the academy to go on. He deserves it for this. He really didn't for ""Gladiator"". And then there is the lovely and brilliant Jennifer Connelly. She holds her own up against Crowe, and that is no easy task. It only shows you how remarkable she is. I never would have suspected her to be in this kind of acclaim when I saw her in her ealier career(Labryinth, Seven Minutes In Heaven, The Rocketeer, Suspiria). She really is worthy of all the attention. The supporting actors are all great. Christopher Plummer, Paul Bettany, Adam Goldberg, and even Judd Hirsch. The music by James Horner is perfect for this film. Many people bash it as 'sappy' and 'cliched'. Oh please. This movie is great filmmaking. The acting is the best that we could possibly hope for. Anybody who doesn't see that, or has to ridicule because it left out some elements from the book, need to relax. Get over it. What it all comes down too people, is that this is a love story. Alicia Nash stayed with John through all of the hell. Today, they are in their 70's, and they are still very much together. Nothing is more powerful than that. How wonderful. A Beautiful Mind is a beautiful movie. It rekindles your faith in filmmaking. Come Oscar time, if there aren't any gold statues with this film's title on them, it will be a huge upset. Go see this movie. You will fell better afterwards knowing that you did. What a treat. Thank you Ron Howard.",N/A

THis alone would deserve expert special effects.THere's also special effects when Satan appears. There's world wide caos going on.Also, the movie spans a fifty-years period of time...The good point is to see that people still give leading roles to old actors. Michael York (one of the co-producers) is strong some kind of spiritual and political leader. David Hedison surprised me. He's still strong (I was always a fan of VOYAGE TO THE BOTTOM OF THE SEA).

297582,"I first watched &quot;Citizen Kane&quot; in college in a class called history of journalism.  We were drawing parallels between fictional newspaper giant Charles Foster Kane and real-life media mogul William Randolph Hearst.  There are so many coincidences that it's no wonder this film was almost halted before it hit theatres.But it's still fantastic and especially revolutionary for 1941.  Multi-hyphenate Orson Welles and cinematographer Gregg Tollan employed innovative filmmaking tricks that had never been thought of before.  And Welles delivers a stirring performance as sometimes carefree, sometimes brutal, but always wealthy Kane.  It's an engrossing and interesting story filled with success, heartache, and scandal.In order to appreciate the caliber of this movie, you must understand film history and how advanced this movie was compared with other films made around the same time.  You must also have some knowledge of Hearst's life so you can appreciate some of the humor and satire.  Otherwise, you will find it boring and certainly won't understand why the AFI called it the greatest movie ever.Do I think it's the greatest movie ever made?  No.  What is the point in calling a movie the greatest ever made when movies are still being produced today?  Who's to say that a movie won't come along in the future that leaves &quot;Citizen Kane&quot; in the dust?  It hasn't happened yet, but it could.

718957,"Monterey the rock festival still stands in the shadows of the bigger and gaudier Woodstock, but &quot;Monterey Pop&quot; the film has no rival as a time capsule of late-'60s rock. It's smarter, hipper and more musical than other rock films of the era. Audio and video on this carefully crafted three-DVD set easily pass the acid test. Restoration efforts (detailed in the set's splendid booklet and in the extras) yielded a 5.1 sound that's updated yet true to the time -- check out some of the old-style stereo separation and the AM radio punch of the percussion. Rear channels give off stadium ambiance, instrument echoes and audience cheers, making for an open, you-are-there vibe. In contrast, the audio on Criterion's 1988 laserdisc sounds like a decent unidimensional bootleg. Likewise, the video taken from the original 16mm negatives looks flower-child fresh, with almost none of the deterioration that plagued the previous video. Significant color correction is evident, and grain has been banished. (Audio and video on the outtakes have significantly rougher edges, including a lot of hair on the lenses.)&quot;Monterey Pop&quot; captured the hippie music scene at a time closer to the Newport of Dylan than the chaos of the big Eastern rock fests. Many acts were folkies making the transition to rock, accomplished performers right at home on Monterey's small, traditional stage. The mixed bag of performers included hitmakers the Mamas and the Papas, Simon and Garfunkel, Jefferson Airplane, Canned Heat, the Who and Buffalo Springfield.Several of the era's biggest acts -- notably the Beatles and Stones -- failed to make the scene in Northern California, leaving the glory to a pair of mostly unknown performers: Janis Joplin and Jimi Hendrix. The DVD's revved-up audio and video powerfully echo the shock of new from Joplin's &quot;Ball and Chain&quot; and Hendrix's &quot;Wild Thing.&quot;Time has been kind to many of Pennebaker's creative decisions. The inclusion of international acts Hugh Masekela and Ravi Shankar gives the film a contemporary musical tone. Otis Redding makes the cut, not Lou Rawls.

444798,"Wes Anderson (director of ""Rushmore"" and ""The Royal Tenenbaums"") has said that when he and Owen Wilson hit a block in one of their scripts, they (consciously or not) steal something from ""The Graduate"".  Magically, everything gets back on track.  Being a huge fan of Anderson and Wilson's work, I figured I'd give ""The Graduate"" another try.  My first viewing left me underwhelmed.  Amused, but underwhelmed.  But seeing it again, with freshly graduated eyes, it's a different story.  The film is damn near perfect.The first act can be off-putting.  It was to me.  Less concerned with reality than with tone, it comes off as little more than self-obsessed parody, enamored with its own jokes (""Plastics!"" has become stale with time) and the angst of its protagonist.  And with the benefit of hindsight, Dustin Hoffman's clipped monotonic speech makes it appear like he's playing a younger version of Raymond Babbitt than the newly graduated Benjamin Braddock.  Thankfully, things relax when Mrs. Robinson (Anne Bancroft) comes on the scene, and the film can get down to brass tacks.Benjamin and Mrs. Robinson's seduction scene is a wonder of comic awkwardness.  While she's in total control and full of ennui, he's sweating and stumbling while trying to hatch an escape route.  But he stays.  And the next sequence, their inevitable coupling, is ludicrous on several levels.  First, it revels in the cheeky double entendres paranoiacally swirling around Ben's head (Buck Henry, as a hotel desk clerk, asks innocently, ""Are you here for an *affair*, sir?""; ""Wood?"" asks Ben of Mrs. Robinson, gauging her preference of clothes hangers, instead of making a pass, as she nearly assumes).  Second, it is underscored by Simon and Garfunkel's 'Sounds of Silence'.  The song choice is ludicrous because its dulcet tones would seem to have nothing to do with detached copulation.  But read the lyrics.  Is this not Ben's voice, trying to scream above the ""ten thousand people, maybe more... talking without speaking... hearing without listening""?  In his affair with Mrs. Robinson, Ben is searching for his voice (in the wrong place, as we shall soon see).The bulk of the second act is concerned with Ben meeting and then being rejected by Elaine, Mrs. Robinson's daughter.  The first hour, so nearly perfect in its satire and depiction of Californian malaise, left doubts in me that the second hour could live up to it.  Thankfully, and an equal part of the credit should go to Katharine Ross as Dustin Hoffman, it does.  Hoffman relaxes around Ross, putting on a cloak of easy charisma and charm, allowing the honest emotions of his love to shine through.  Ross, for her part, is always open and receptive to Ben, and even gives back as much as she gets.  Their knee-jerk fall into love is made sensible by the obvious chemistry between the actors.  The act is scored, again paradoxically perfectly, by another S&G; songs, 'Scarborough Fair'.  With its constant wish of ""then she'll be a true love of mine"", it too captures the mood of the sequence perfectly.In act three, Ben tries to redeem himself after all his mistakes.  And thanks to the care the filmmakers took in setting him up, you can't help but feel for Ben as he runs through the streets of Santa Barbara looking for Elaine's wedding.  'Mrs. Robinson', the third major S&G; song used, works here mainly for its ambiguity.  Which one of Ben's women does its titular character represent?  Doesn't matter, really.  Just follow the bouncy beat, hum ""coo coo ca-choo"", and long for the innocent days when Joe DiMaggio held the gaze of a nation's lonely eyes.Many have hypothesized that ""The Graduate"" is about the sixties' youth rebellion.  But in the end, and in the beginning if you look close enough, it's not about rebellion, but conformity on one's own terms.  Ben determines to botch the date his parents set him up on.  But eventually he ends up on a bus with that very same girl, she in her wedding dress, he with a ripped jacket.  He has just stolen her away from a button-down fiancee, and their future together appears to be filled with laughter.  Until, and this happens in a quick moment, the laughter subsides, and they realize they barely know each other.  It's not groundbreaking for me to say that this scene runs the emotional gamut from exhilaration to anxiety in just the expressions on the actors' faces.  But it's worth mentioning one more time for those who've missed it.I didn't expect it to be, but ""The Graduate"" is still fresh today, more than thirty years after its first release.  And it's also about a lot more than adultery, post-graduate misery, and romantic love.  It has much critical to say about the generation from whence it sprang.  I suspect Mike Nichols, whose direction is whimsical and witty without ever being overbearing, and Buck Henry/Calder Willingham, whose screenplay abounds with sharp jokes and sharper observations about human nature, deserve a lot of the credit.  Regardless, ""The Graduate"" is one of those rare films whose appeal and importance hasn't lessened over time; in fact, on both counts, it may have increased.",The Graduate
156073,"A werewolf movie that is part comedy and part horror, The Howling is a genre classic. Joe Dante directed this with flair, and the leads are engaging, especially Dee Wallace and Elisabeth Brooks as her evil double. Wallace, a TV reporter, puts her life on the line to help catch a sociopath named ""Eddie"" at the film's beginning. But things go haywire and she goes to a remote colony with her husband to recoup. This colony is actually a colony of werewolves, and from there Wallace and her friends try to stop what is happening. Lots of good werewolf lore included, a ton of in-jokes and cameo appearances (including Slim Pickens, Dick Miller and Forrest J Ackerman), but the real star of this film is the make-up effects by Rob Bottin, which are still the industry standard (people made a large fuss about Baker's work for An American Werewolf in London, but Bottin's work is better).

Drugs seem eery and frightening here, a bad trip, instead of as keys to open doors of perception.  It's telling that the disaster at Altamont happened to the 'Stones, because their aimlessness and lack of political feeling are on display here.The 'Stones come across as stoned and shallow, people who just want to party and have sex.  Their audience seems similarly apolitical and in search of only a good time.  While an imperialist war rages in Vietnam, and while a social revolution continues in the US and Britain, the Stones were interested only in themselves.  Their apathy has its mirror in the Altamont nightmare.The film, though, is slow-going.  It doesn't rock or excite, and it doesn't probe the characters involved.

Streep and Irons play present-day actors who are making a film about two people having an affair in Victorian England.  The actors themselves are also involved in an affair, making the story a sort of movie-within-a-movie.  I have not read the Fowles novel, so I don't have any of the gripes that other reviewers have voiced.  I can only tell you that the story, the performances, the settings, the cinematography and the writing are all first-rate.  All connected with this film obviously took a lot of time and effort to make a visually stunning film.  It still looks great 20 years after its release, and looks even better on DVD (despite the fact that the disc offers no extras except the theatrical trailer...oh well...).  Even if you end up hating the story, I don't think anyone would complain about the superior performances by Irons and Streep.Possibly the reason this film has been largely forgotten is the timing.  This film was released in 1981, a year or two before Streep's blow-you-away performance in 'Sophie's Choice.'  That performance was so spectacular that many have forgotten just how good 'French Lt.' is.

46207,"In this world of rotten monster movies, where special effects dominate and hideous mutants rip off various limbs and cause havoc... it's nice to go back and be shown how it's really done. Based on Peter Benchley's novel, Speilberg directs masterfully, exhuding masses of tension from his principle trio and obviously from the shark itself. The creature admittadly has its technical limitations, but those are forgiven in the film's brilliant first half, where the shark isn't shown... merely it's camera-view and it's grisly results. This armed with John Williams' unforgettable score will get far more hearts beating than any CGI monster - one scene in particular with a fisherman frantically swimming back to shore as an unseen Jaws (dragging a huge chunk of a bridge) comes towards him. As his feet scrabble up the wood to safety, you'll finally realise how simple Speilberg's techniques are - in simplicity he's got your pulse racing, without too much gore or mess.There's a real human element here. These atrocities have consequences (shown by Mrs. Kintner) and we truly care about Brody (Scheider) Hooper (Dreyfuss) and Quinn (Shaw). The film's second half, as our trio head off to kill the shark, leaving the island behind and going pretty much one-on-one with the beast, is tension all the way. This time the shark's involvement is somewhat more visual, demonstrating it's rather bulky appearance... but even so, John Williams helps keep things thumping along. Even the little touches, like Quinn's Indianapolis speech, help put things in perspective and really make us hate the shark. That's what sets this apart, it's not all focusing on the shark, or who it kills... there are people involved, played to perfection by Scheider, Dreyfuss and Shaw.The three sequels could never come close to this, with silly modes of dispatching the shark, lots of standard-sequel added bits and Jaws: The Revenge's ludicrous ""shark with a grudge"" concept. It's best just to watch the original, be awed by a fantastic screenplay, some nailbiting direction and economic use of the titular monster, and really see where Hollywood's going wrong these days.

329744,"Unlike most 1950s teenage date flicks, INVASION OF THE SAUCER MEN is still mildly entertaining today--and this, when combined with modern reaction to the film's typically ""Golly Gee"" mentality, makes the movie amusing.  The story is basic: two all-American teenagers on lover's lane accidently run over a little green man from outer space and are then threatened by his friends--but will any of the grown-ups believe them?  Of course not, they're just crazy kids!The movie bills itself as a deliberate mixture of comedy and horror; although very mild, the comedy is genuine--but unless you have a fear of children dressed up in big-headed space alien costumes you're unlikely to be even slightly startled, much less horrified.  Even the teenagers under attack seldom seem greatly concerned, and our leading lady is more worried about having to hike in heels (""My feet are killing me!"") than about little green men from outer space.  All in all, INVASION OF THE SAUCER MEN lacks the true camp appeal of, say, an Ed Woods movie--but even so it has its points: special effects so tame that even the actors can't get worked up about them, mildly absurd performances (watch for Frank Gorshin), and an odd-ball script.

Shocked and disturbed he reports it immediately to the police whilst, with the help of his girlfriend (Laura Dern), he begins his own investigation, which soon leads him into stumbling into the seedy and violent world of abused nightclub singer Dorothy (Isabella Rosellini) and drug-sniffing psychopath (Dennis Hopper).This is the first movie in which David Lynch really showed us all his cards and united themes and imagery, now familiar to millions through the likes of Mulholland Drive, Wild At Heart and Twin Peaks. Although 16 years old, David Lynch's Blue Velvet has lost none of its shock value. It is still deeply and uniquely disturbing, at times incredibly surreal and utterly compelling viewing. Beautifully filmed and directed by Lynch, its aesthetic value is often deliberately at odds with the subject matter and it is a work of dark genius. It also features superb acting performances all round.  In particular, MacLachlan, Rosselinni, Dean Stockwell and Laura Dern shine, but it is Dennis Hopper's magnificent performance as a drug sniffing twisted psychopath that most people will remember.Bizarre and frequently haunting, beautiful but frequently surreal, this is a movie that will stay with you for a very long time and really is a must see!",N/A

295408,"This is an interesting and serviceable Hamlet both different and the same as other Hamlets done in the past. Its abbreviated by half. And unfortunately by necessity characters are altered pretty drastically and you'll never get a feel for the really fascinating and motivations of the lesser characters that are really make the play a great experience when seen in full.  But if you haven't seen the entire version I doubt you will feel deprived.  I guess what makes this version distinctive is Mel Gibson plays Hamlet driven with a measure of rage and aggressiveness that is probably refreshing to people who are used to seeing him as the &quot;melancholy Dane&quot;.  So this is a pretty good version that tries to retell Hamlet in an original way. This is directed by Franco Zefferelli who in my opinion did the &quot;definitive&quot; version of Romeo and Juliet that I doubt will ever be topped. I think he also directed the best of the Jesus movies.  I can't say this is the best Hamlet, the new modern version is pretty good and the Kenneth Branaugh version is really awesome because he really understands every minute of the play. He plays Hamlet as incredibly intelligent and cunning. Hopefully this version will whet your appetite for his full version coming to DVD later this year. Unfortunately B's Hamlet is a very (panoramic) widescreen title that must be just awful in pan and scan and is going to look quite small on a 27 inch tv screen.  This version of Hamlet plays alright on the tv screen because it pretty much stays focused on Hamlet himself and the periphral characters are not nearly as important to this retelling as they are in the full version. The only negative thing I have to say about this version is that everyone is a little bit too crazy. Ophelia becomes totally mad in this version. Hamlet is supposed to be feigning madness and in the real play he plays mad when it serves his purposes. Gibson's Hamlet actually is a little crazy. Sometimes I think this waters down the motivations a little too much. I always have to remind myself watching this that there is only half the time to tell the story so its a pretty competant job.If you like this, definitely check out Zefferelli's Romeo and Juliet. And if you have a big big screen TV, Branaugh's Hamlet later in the year when it comes out.",Hamlet VHS

Whether it be a drug addicted porn star in ""Boogie Nights"", stepping into the shoes of Clarice Starling in place of Jodie Foster for the film ""Hannibal"" or as the perfect 1950s wife and socialite in this film, she always seems to be right on target.  Cathy, a dedicated wife and mother (imagine the combination of TV mom, June Cleaver and Melanie Wilkes of ""Gone With the Wind""), seems to lead a life that anyone would clamor for. She is kind to everyone, well respected and a role model for the women in her community.  As the film progresses, however, we see how her world slowly begins to unravel.  Her husband, played very nicely by Dennis Quaid, is a man tormented by the fact that he can no longer control his homosexual urges. The fact that he is uncomfortable with his repressed sexual orientation causes him to lash out at his wife and turn to alcohol.  The one person Cathy turns to for consulation is the family's new gardener, an African American man (Dennis Haysbert of Fox's drama ""24"").  A friendship grows between the two, who see the beauty in each other but both the period of time and Cathy's social circle frown upon such a friendship and most definitely a relationship.  The story is a very emotional ride and well worth the admission for this film. Diretor Todd Haynes does a great job of mixing beautiful scenery and the slow building of tension among the story's main protaganists to make a deeply engrossing film.  Patricia Clarkson is good as well protraying Cathy's best friend, a woman in her social circle who shows her true colors at Cathy's time of need.

308488,Bela Lugosi gives a stellar performance as the zombie master in White Zombie. This is one of Lugosi's strongest performances and one of his strongest films. White Zombie is consistently entertaining from beginning to end. And that entertainment rises and falls on Lugosi's wonderful ability to breathe life into even the &quot;deadest&quot; of roles.The movie begins with an engaging yet eerie &quot;Haitian&quot; funeral song and it is revealed that a burial ceremony is taking place in the middle of the road because so many bodies have been stolen -- no sooner do we learn this than Bela appears with a entourage of zombies. He steals a scarf from the film's ingenue. It seems he has been contracted by a wealthy plantation owner to secure the love of this fair maiden for him. Of course it isn'tlong before Bela turns on the wealthy scoundrel and makes him a zombie too.Of course true love wins in the end and Lugosi is pushed off a cliff by the new zombified planataion owner and the young woman and her handsome beau are free to go get married. . .But through it all Bela Lugosi makes you believe he is truly capable of controlling the wills of others with his magnificent eyes and powerful imminence. This is the movie that Bela and Ed are watching in the movie Ed Wood -- and he uses the famous interlocking hand gesture that he would later repeat in Bride of the Monster.White Zombie is my favorite zombie movie -- I realize it doesn't provide he visceral thrills and claustraphobic intensity that Night of the Living ead does -- but it is a more subtle kind of film that focusses on the zombie master rather than his minnions. The film's director knew Bela's strengths as a silent actor and utilizes him to the fullest.I highly recommend White Zomie to the Bela Lugosi and horror movie fan.

407079,"Outside of DBZ, Tenchi, and other cartoon network-popularized anime shows, Evangelion is probably the biggest thing out there. Any anime fan, casual or obsessive, knows about it, and it's one of the most greatly loved (and occasionally hated) shows there is.The plot centers around the organization Nerv and its efforts to eradicate the mysterious and seemingly hostile ""Angels"" using the Evas (giant robots at first glance) and their fourteen-year old pilots. The necessity of fourteen-year olds is never explained, but it's through the eyes of one such pilot, Shinji Ikari, that we're introduced to the show. Shinji is joined by the ultra-quiet Rei Ayanami and the arrogant and dominating Asukah Langley Sohryu in piloting the Evas. Their guardian Misato, the scientist Ritsuko, Misato's ex-boyfriend Kaji, and Shinji's father Gendo round out the main characters.Evangelion's cast is one of its strongest points. Some criticize Shinji for his total lack of toughness and resolve, but he occupies an important place in the cast's emotional layout. He's balanced by his father, as Gendo is incredibly cold, calculating and decisive. Rei and Asukah are also polar opposites, and their interaction is well done. Asukah loves to be bossy but is annoyed by Rei's apparent indifference. The legendarily sexy Misato is possibly the show's most memorable character. She's carefree, messy, and irresponsible, and when Kaji enters the picture sparks immediately fly. Ritsuko is quiet but intense and she knows a lot, but often seems to play the role of a major background character.Put together, this is an incredibly memorable lot, and the show throws them in interesting and conflicting situations frequently. They're also very well acted with Megumi Hayashibara contributing a little star power as Rei. Evangelion also has the best dub I've ever heard. It's probably the only show that I might actually prefer to watch in English. Character rating: 5/5.It's in terms of plot Evangelion starts to slide. There are basically two sides to this show. First is the fairly light-hearted and character-driven side. The episodes typically include an Angel attack and a fight (the fight scenes are excelently done), but they also come with healthy doses of humor. None of this is terribly complex, but it's very fun. It makes up about the first three-fifths of the show. But from there, the show changes. It becomes more heavy and atmospheric and while this is handled well from the emotional side, the plot becomes somewhat aimless. The angels are still there, but there are increasing references to events and things that were never really well defined in the first place (the creator made a good deal of this up as he went along). We also start getting plenty of somewhat obscure and probably meaningless religious references and symbolism, which only makes matters worse. So Evangelion winds up sort of tapering off at the end, and it doesn't help that we get virtually no character closure at all (most characters are in some stage of psychological crisis by this point). Finally, there are the last two episodes. You've probably already heard something about these. They really don't seem connected to the main show at all. They primarily consist of one of the characters sitting in a chair in a darkened room being asked questions to the tone of: ""who are you?"" and ""how do you know you're you?"". A few people really like these episodes, but I consider them mainly off the subject and fairly interminable. I've heard that Hideaki Ano was having some psychological problems of his own at the time, so much of this was his attempts at working out his own problems. I don't know how accurate this is, but it makes sense. It's too bad the series had to end this way.All in all though, Evangelion is pretty good. My long-winded assessment of the last several episodes in all likelihood made the series sound worse than it is. I love the characters, and I like much of the plot. This series is a fine buy, although it's mainstream enough that you might be able to rent a few tapes to start. I don't really like the format of these DVD's, but you do get French and Spanish language versions in addition to the standard English and Japanese.Evangelion is a pretty good series if not a great one, and if you don't go in expecting a brilliant plot build-up and climax you probably won't be dissapointed.",Neon Genesis Evangelion: Genesis 0:2 VHS

Instead, he finds himself pitted in a pscychological and spiritual war against a real-life head of a devil cult.  At stake is his soul.I've heard Dana Andrews described as ""the aging leading man"" when refering to this role, but he looks and performs in top shape.  The entire supporting British cast is wonderful, led by Niall McGinnis, who plays the part of cult leader Karswell as a genteel, likable middle-aged man, even fearful at times, but determined in his evil beliefs and acts.The movie begins with the ""accidental death/murder"" of a fellow pscychologist of Holden, which leads to his staunt investigation into the cult and its leader.  As he nears the truth, his owned cursed life begins to take on a distorted, frightening twist.  He is on a countdown to his own murder(litterally predicted hour and second by his nemisis), by a horrific fire-demon that will tear his soul from his body and carry him to the depths of hell.  The movie really picks up pace in the last act, where Dr. Holden and his investiative team interviews an ex-cultist accused of murder while under hypnosys.  The horror coming out in the man's testimony, and the following panicked-mad flight into death, leads Holden on his own near-panick flight, to do a final battle of wits with Karswell.This DVD includes both the shortened American version, ""Curse of the Demon"", and the longer (better) British version, ""Night of the Demon.""  Both are presented in widescreen.  The source print shows little wear or damage, for being such an old film.  This is a wonderful, bump-in-the-night thriller.  And if the appearance of the demon is dated by todays special effects standards, it is still amazingly well done, and at times frighteningly believable.",Curse of the Demon VHS
47978,"Those words are the tag line for every fictionalized account of space exploration disaster, but the one time they were spoken in earnest makes all the fictionalized accounts wane like the setting moon.APOLLO 13 is a great film. Tom Hanks, who plays Jim Lovell, spacecraft Commander of the aptly-named ""Odyssey"" really deserved an Academy Award for this one (and might have gotten it, had he not already won previously, two years running).The film recounts the terrifying ordeal of astronauts Lovell, Jack Swigert (Kevin Bacon), Fred Haise (Bill Paxton), their families, and their ground-based support crew, after an oxygen tank explosion on the third lunar landing mission forces an abort. The three men have to reduce their spacecraft to barely livable conditions in order to survive a quarter-million miles from home.Director Ron Howard captures the tension of the event perfectly, and also recaptures the ambience of NASA in 1970, a mixture of energy, technical competence, and frustration, when it seemed the American public had just about forgotten it's once lionized space program in the wake of moon missions so successful they seemed absolutely boring.For anyone old enough to remember those fearsome days of Apollo 13, as I do, this movie sparks memories. For a moment in time, the planet was united: besides the Western Powers, the Soviets, the Red Chinese, the North Koreans and North Vietnamese set out rescue vessels to retreive the returning men.With barely enough electricity to run a toaster, limited water, no heat, and hardly any oxygen, the three astronauts faced almost certain death. Ron Howard captures their understated emotion, as well as their phenomenal resilience and test-pilot cool, without making them seem miraculously superhuman or unassailably cold-blooded.Bacon's Swigert, a last-minute replacement to the crew can't help but gloat over his good luck, and then becomes increasingly waspish as the disastrous mission winds on.Gary Sinise, as Ken Mattingly, grounded for an illness he'd never contracted, is at first embittered, but later becomes an enthusiastic fourth crew member as he unstoppably tests out rescue scenario after rescue scenario in the NASA simulators.Bill Paxton plays an increasingly ill Fred Haise with such conviction that the viewer shudders with compassionate sympathy as Fred's flu and fever make him both less able to contribute and less willing to give in to his sudden illness.Kathleen Quinlan, as Marilyn Lovell, and Ed Harris, as Gene Krantz, both turn in true-to-life performances, both of which capture the hopes and fears not only of Mrs. Lovell and Flight Controller Krantz, but of the rest of the hundreds of people involved in the rescue effort on the ground.Without becoming ""documentary"" the film uses clips of actual news broadcasts to underscore its reality. What's particularly surprising is the low-tech state of the Apollo; a digital wristwatch of today has more computing power than the entire Apollo space vehicle. This movie is also a very watchable, almost completely accurate history. There are a few moments of Directorial license in the telling of the tale, but not many. The story doesn't need additional drama. I recommend Jim Lovell's excellent book LOST MOON (or APOLLO 13), to sort out the occasional changes.As it was, the technology of Apollo both failed and succeeded beyond reckoning. As spectacular an accomplishment as a moon landing is, it pales besides the importance of the human drama.""I don't care what anything was designed to do,"" barks Krantz at one point, ""I only want to know what it can do."" It  seems that Jim Lovell's mother has the answer: ""If they could get a washing machine to fly, my Jimmy could land it.""APOLLO 13 is a great testament to the human spirit.",N/A
166259,"Fast, Cheap & Out of Control interweaves the stories of four eccentric men, each obsessed by their disparate professions. Dave Hoover (a lion tamer), George Mendona (a topiary gardener), Ray Mendez (a mole-rate expert), and Rodney Brooks (a robot scientist), are oddballs so driven by their respective passions that they totally tune out the world around them.Taken separately, each man is, himself, an interesting story. Hoover is barbarous to his beautiful lions but totally devoted to them as well. He is like a husband who beats his wife in the belief she will love him the more for it. Mendona is a charming relic, Brooks a cyber-dweeb. By far the strangest among them is Mendez, the mole-rat afficionado. He delights in engineering an environment most suitable for their naked, twitching bodies. He animatedly describes how they, as the only mammals without sweatglands, use the odor of their feces as a species signature. One guesses that, if he could, he'd like nothing more than to crawl inside those plastic tubes with his beloved mole-rats.It is a puzzling documentary to watch; I was constantly trying to figure out the commonality Morris wanted me to see. What is the thread that can be sewn through all their lives? They all work in fields involving animals. A couple of them work in dying professions, while a couple others see mankind as the breed on its way out. Ultimately, the only commonality I found amongst them was their uncompromising commitment to live on the fringes of society and their total disinterest in the rest of us.Morris, though, is clearly at the top of his game. From seeing The Thin Blue Line, we trust that Morris knows how to tell a story. Here, he explores the technical side of his craft in a rather cut-and-loose fashion. Working with cinematographer Robert Richardson, Morris utilizes numerous film resolutions to create a singularly impressionistic collage of images. He splices black and white footage with different film formats to create a jagged and eerie mood that is pervasive throughout the film. The music by Caleb Sampson at times enhances the awe we feel in observing these unique men, and provokes wonder. Occasionally it goes over-the-top and overwhelms the story, almost to the point of distraction.Absurd, original, and dark, Fast, Cheap & Out of Control is a voyeuristic peek at the iconoclastic nature of human diversion.",N/A

43162,"I just started watching this DVD again for the third or fourth time, and this series is a staggering achievement.  The Apollo project, more and more, emerges as far and away the single most significant event of the last 50 years, one of those extraordinary feats that emerges from its times and yet transcends them.  The series helps to grasp the sheer magnitude of the achievement of the Apollo project--as well as being gripping and deeply moving drama.  Giving the history of the space program since the lunar landings, there is an elegiac quality as well--America's short-sighed leaders backed off from a great achievement and failed to maintain the momentum that the space program created during the crucial decade of the 1960's.Watch this set for great drama (and humor), for superb effects, and most of all for inspiration.  Here's hoping that this will galvanize future leaders to keep going into space and taking the next great leap--the manned Mars expedition.",From the Earth to the Moon
664469,"Boy something else! For example, if you must buy Thomas, then buy the VHS version...NOT the DVD.I'm all for DVD. I was an early adopter and love the image quality. Remember years ago when you switched from tape to CD and loved the random-access? No more forever fast-forwarding and rewinding. DVD promises the same? Depends on the producer. We have all of the Thomas DVDs and they are all the same: you cannot get straight to the menu but instead are forced to watch meaningless junk.A DVD producer encodes the disc with a script file full of various directives. Unfortunately, most (if not all) DVD players are programmed to honor these directives. For example, the Thomas discs will disallow the 'menu' and other keys during the first FIVE MINUTES of commercial material. In my opinion, it is a mistake for disc producers to make use of this feature for marketing. Even the FBI warning should be skip-able. Further, DVD player manufacturers should not program the devices to obey these directives, if present. Give the consumer the choice/control he deserves and the capabilities he paid for.Before you say ""stop complaining about 5 little minutes"", consider this: of any kind of movie for which my arguments make sense...children's titles make the most sense. Most of the time it works as follows. My older boy wants to see a movie--he is patient about it. My younger boy needs to be put down for a nap. I am way behind on housework and rushing to get things done. What makes sense is that I should be able to put the disc in the tray and walk away! But, I cannot. I have to sit and wait 5 minutes...and then *finally* the menu appears. Still, I have to be there for this great moment because the movie does not automatically start at that point. It waits for me to press a single button: 'enter'.There should be no commercial material unless offered as a ""bonus material"" selection in the menu. The movie should not require a menu selection, instead it should simply start playing if the menu button has not been pushed.Disney learned this lesson years ago. Until the producers of Thomas also learn this lesson, just avoid it!",N/A
414000,"England, 1826--the toil and drudgery of the coal miners is emphasized with the opening elegiac music.  Jack Ward and his companions go to the bath house to wash, but suddenly, gas seeps through the walls, sending them to unconsciousness.  They reemerge alive, but with red circles under their ears, and acting violently.  They kick a food stand, knocking down its contents and a young boy.The Doctor and Peri are en route to Kew Gardens, but the TARDIS is pulled of course to 1826.  There, they try to find the source of the time disturbance and trace it to the Rani, who like the Master is a renegade Time Lord and an old classmate.This is a semi-historical story, as they meet George Stephenson, the engineer whose Blucher locomotive hauled coal from Killingworth colliery.  The Doctor tells Peri:  &quot;How would you like to meet a genius?&quot;  She says, &quot;I thought I already had.&quot;The Rani, who has been taking the brain fluid enabling men to sleep throughout history, treats humans as &quot;walking heaps of chemicals.&quot;  &quot;There's no place for the soul in her scheme of things.&quot;  Result:  the men become restless and violent.  When the Doctor argues that humans haven't done any harm to her, she counters with:  &quot;They're carnivores.  What harm have the animals in the fields done them, the rabbits they snare?... Do they worry about the lesser species when they sink their teeth into a lamb chop?&quot;  Point to the Rani there.  She's so callous, the Doctor angrily tells her &quot;They should never have exiled you.  They should have locked you in a padded cell!&quot;The Master is also here.  Not only has he improved his compressor so that its victim totally vanishes, he wants to use the Rani's skills to continue his feud with the Doctor.  The Rani has nothing but contempt for the Master and even mocks the rivalry between them:  &quot;It obsesses you to the exclusion of all else.&quot;,  &quot;You're unbalanced--no wonder why the Doctor always outwits you.&quot;  She even says of his schemes:  &quot;It'd be something devious and overcomplicated.  He's be dizzy if he tried to walk in a straight line.&quot;  Indeed, the Master is a bumbler here compared to the clever and efficient Rani.  I wouldn't want to tangle with the Rani.The interior of the Rani's TARDIS alone is worth watching this episode, as is a feature of it revisited at the end of The Two Doctors.  Let's see, goofs and other things:  The cliffhanger to Part 1 is effective, there's a small added scene when the cliffhanger is repeated in Part 2, which elicits a &quot;Oh, come on!&quot;  Peri has a nice apricot dress, but as for that yellow top... urgh!  And the Luddite riots ended in 1816, a decade earlier.Kate O'Mara makes the Rani more formidable than the Master and easily carries this story.  Other honors go to Gawn Grainger as Stephenson and as Terence Alexander as Lord Ravensworth, head of Killingworth.

705931,"I expected this to be a great movie and I must say I was slightly let down. I was expecting a Vietnam version of Braveheart in a way which I suppose was a tough standard to beat. The bad thing though was that I had seen this after two other war movies, 'Behind Enemy Lines' and 'Black Hawk Down'. 'Black Hawk Down' was in my opinion a better film and 'Behind Enemy Lines' was very different in that it went more for a summer popcorn type of war movie. Mel Gibson is, as always, terrific here and Sam Elliot does a great job as well. This is a different film than 'Black Hawk Down' was in that it showed the enemy's viewpoint as well as the view on the homefront. I thought that this worked to the film's advantage.I must however say that this is a better war movie than the recent John Woo film 'Windtalkers' which was, after four war films, nothing new. Explosions get a little less exciting and the story falters after the chain of recent war films but nevertheless this is a film that I would recommend if the subject matter is of interest.",N/A

226375,"""My Bodyguard"" is a story about high school sophomore Clifford Peache (Chris Makepeace).  On just his first day of school, he pisses off the class bully Melvin Moody (Matt Dillon).  Later, Moody corners Clifford in the bathroom and tells him that he provides ""protection"" to a lot of the kids for a dollar a day.  Clifford considers that to be extortion and decides he'll have no part of it.  Needless to say, that just makes Moody target him even more.  Clifford employs the assistance of another kid in the class named Ricky Linderman (Adam Baldwin).  Ricky has a shady past and there are rumors floating around that he killed a cop and assaulted a teacher.  Clifford decides to hire Ricky to be his bodyguard.  It works for a while because Moody is afraid to fight him.Of course, there would be no movie if everything went smoothly after this little arrangement.  Problems develop and the situation escalates until the predictable ending.  While ""My Bodyguard"" isn't anything amazing, it is saved by an amiable script, decent direction and especially a talented young cast.  This was the first starring role for both Adam Baldwin and Joan Cusack.  As always, Joan was wonderful in a role which was small but showed that she was going to be a promising new actress.  This was only the second major role for Matt Dillon and it really helped to establish him as a hot young actor as well.  Martin Mull, Ruth Gordon and an appearance by John Houseman rounded out the capable cast.""My Bodyguard"" is one of those rare high school movies that actually stars teenagers.  That is always a plus because it helps add to the reality.  You truly believe that these could be kids facing actual problems.  It doesn't come across as a bunch of twentysomethings playing parts.  However, this film falls short in a key area.  It ends up sending the message that if you are being hassled in high school then try and fight your way out of it.  I guess the fact that you may end up hospitalized or expelled is unimportant.  Not everyone is a good fighter and not everyone has the privilege of having a bodyguard.  What about them?",N/A
518173,"I caught this particular show a few years back on HBO whilst switchin' channels, and decided to stay tuned in just to see what this Eddie Izzard guy was all about. Sadly, it wasn't all about him being funny.  Except for his observation that most Star Wars&trade; villains are British (which in itself wasn't all that amusing), I found the man's act a an veritable bomberoo. I endured this pathetically unfunny piece of tripe from beginning to end without uttering so much as a soft chuckle. I found myself slowly slipping into a catatonic state of utter boredom as he doled out his insipid and pointless ramblings about Scooby-Doo&trade;, his lame spiel about coming up with an original sin, his ""cake or death"" bit that went nowhere fast, and his nodding-and-shaking-his-head dealy that he milked for some REALLY cheap laughs for about two minutes to punctuate some other pitiful bit of his.In fact, the only laughing I heard was from the audience, and most likely polite laughter at that. You know, the kinda guffaws that come about when the audience doesn't actually think the man's jokes were funny, but they don't wanna bring him down? Yeah, now you know what I mean! I know if I were an audience member watching this coma-inducing roll of wall-to-wall lameness, I'd've stormed the box office threatening to sue if I didn't get a full refund!The only time I had even an inkle of emotional reaction to this travesty was when I sighed in relief as the closing credits rolled. A few minutes later, however, I became depressed when I realized I just wasted an hour of my life watching this heapin' load o' dreck! I'd've had a better time listening to the recitation of the minutes from the British Parliament's last session than watching this loser!Then there's the whole dressing in drag thing, which is pretty much clich&eacute; nowadays. Personally, I think it's his way of kissing up to the original British comedy drag-sters, Monty Python's Flying Circus (of course, his claim will be that his cross-dressing is a `tribute' to the Pythons, but I see right through that ploy!). If you doubt it, take a look at his little walk-on with MPFC's five surviving members at the beginning of the `Life of Python' interview special. C'mon, now, Edward; stop licking the boots of those has-beens!

You probably think that most of his references and allegedly humorous takes on significant events in European history (i.e. the Crusades) sailed right over my pointy little pin-head, don'cha? It probably didn't even remotely occur to you that perhaps I did grok just about every last bit of this man's so-called ""humor""... which I did, BTW... and I just didn't think it was funny?

Penny Marshall has done it again, directing a film that struck all the right cords in me...much like the movie ""Where the Heart Is"" ( A masterpiece itself-not to be missed).Drew Barrymore plays Beverly, a fifteen year old who spoils her father's (James Wood) life plan to have a perfect family by getting knocked up at the age of 15.  While her family ponders what to ""do"" with her, Beverly has a plan already in formation(She IS a talented and smart girl after all). She will get a job, finish high school, and go to college. Her parents don't want a family crisis or controversy, so they convince her to marry the father of her child instead(Steve Zahn), who is a washed-up drip of a loser, yet a willing father and husband.  Bev agrees, not wanting to cause her family any more grief.While this movie is meant to be dramatic, it offers some outright laughs during very intense scenes. At Beverly's wedding (she wears pink) her best friend Fran (The VERY talented Brittany Murphy from ""Girl Interupted"" and ""Don't Say a Word"") announces to the wedding crowd that she is also pregnant. Could Bev's father have a worse nightmare?Fran and Bev buddy up, sticking together through life's ""What have I done?"" moments...missing out on the prom, watching their friends go off to college, having babies together, and doing anything they can to make money and leave their small town.  They quickly realize their dreams of each giving birth to two girls( which they hope will grow up and be just like them), two pretty houses, and being best friends forever is not quite reality when there is no money, wandering husbands, and your water breaks.  ""How gross Mom!"" Bev shouts as real life intervenes.  -real life- Take 1.Drew plays a magnificent roll as a young mother who's character spans 20 years from the birth of her son. She is a convincing actress at every age.  While she may be a self-admitted irresponsible parent and make terrible life choices through the years, she is a good mother..despite the fact that she blames everyone, including her son for her misfortunes.I was particularly moved by the ending to this movie. The ""ride"" getting there is just as poignant as you follow Bev's life from a young girl to a mature woman striving to be a great writer and publish her personal memoirs titled appropriately ""Riding in Cars With Boys"".  A perfect title for a woman who had life changing experiences everytime she did ride in a car with the men in her life.  I highly recommend this film to all.  I will go as far and say that it is also a must-own for anyone that appreciates a 'see-it-more-than-once' flick.",Riding in Cars with Boys
33638,"Given the enormous potential for failure, it takes either a lot of guts or a big ego to remake a classic and step into a pair of shoes worn so well by the likes of George C. Scott and Alastair Sim - you don't have to have grown up in an English speaking country to take those two names and their portrayal of Dickens's miserly anti-hero for granted as part of your Christmas experience.  And I suspect a good part of both guts and ego was at play in this production; but let's face it: after years of bringing Scrooge to the stage in a much-acclaimed one man show and after also having recorded the audio book version of ""A Christmas Carol,"" a movie adaptation starring Patrick Stewart was probably due to come out sooner or later.  Yet, while it does sometimes have the feel of another huge star vehicle for Stewart (even without the self-congratulatory trailer and brief ""behind the scenes"" features included on the DVD), his experience and insight into the character of Scrooge allow him to pull off a remarkable performance, and to make the role his own without letting us forget who originally wrote the tale.  From a ""humbug"" growled out from the very depth of his disdain and his audible desire to boil ""every idiot who goes about with 'Merry Christmas' on his lips"" with his own pudding and bury them with a stake of holly through their heart, to the ""splendid"" and ""most illustrious ... father of a long, long line of brilliant laughs,"" coughed up and spit out after years of having been out of practice, this is the Scrooge that Dickens described; and Stewart obviously has the time of his life playing him.This made-for-TV production is sometimes criticized for its use of special effects; I don't find those overly disturbing, though - in fact, they're rather low-key and for the most part used to show nothing more than what Dickens actually described.  (This *is* a ghost story, remember?)  Scrooge really does see Marley's face in his door knocker; we all know that Marley's ghost does indeed walk through Scrooge's doubly locked door ... and last but not least Dickens himself describes the Ghost of Christmas Yet to Come as ""shrouded in a deep black garment, which concealed its head, its face, its form, and left nothing of it visible save one outstretched hand.""  (Granted, no gleaming lights for eyes, though.)  The script could have spared a modernism here and there, but again, mostly the lines are exactly those that Dickens himself wrote.  Even where the characters don't actually speak them, they are part of their reflections - such as Marley being buried and ""dead as a door-nail"" (which, after all, is the tale's all-important premise) and Scrooge's rather funny musings how the Ghost of Christmas Past might be deterred from taking him for a flight (where citing neither the weather nor the hour nor a head cold nor his inadequate dress would do).  Richard E. Grant, known to TV audiences as Sir Percy Blakeney in the recent adaptations of ""The Scarlet Pimpernel,"" moves to the opposite end of the social spectrum in his portrayal of gaunt, downtrodden Bob Cratchit; and he is a very credible caring father and husband, albeit a bit too well-educated - unlike the rest of his family, who speak and come across as decidedly more cockney.  Joel Grey, whose Master of Ceremonies in ""Cabaret"" stands out as one of those ""one of a kind"" performances that are few and far between in film history, is almost perfectly cast as the Ghost of Christmas Past, combining the spirit's wisdom of an old man with his child-like innocence, frail stature and luminous appearance.  A great supporting cast and solid cinematographic and directorial work round out an overall very well done production.Many actors are remembered either for one career-making role or for a certain type they have cast.  No doubt Patrick Stewart, who as a teenager had to face an ultimatum between a steady job and the theater and chose the latter, will go into film history as Captain Jean-Luc Picard of Star Treck's ""Next Generation.""  But I would not be surprised if the other major role he will always be remembered for will be that of Ebenezer Scrooge - on stage, in audio recordings *and* in this movie adaptation, which successfully brings Dickens's timeless tale of bitterness, sorrow, redemption and the true meaning of Christmas to the 21st century, and which before long, I think, will attain the status of a classic in its own right.  I know that I, for one, will be watching it again with renewed pleasure next Christmas.Also recommended:A Christmas Carol and Other Christmas Writings (Penguin Classics)A Christmas Carol (Reissue)A Christmas Carol (Ultimate Collector's Edition)(B/W & Color)Classic Ghost StoriesThe Charles Dickens Collection (Oliver Twist / Martin Chuzzlewit / Bleak House / Hard Times / Great Expectations / Our Mutual Friend)The Charles Dickens Collection, Vol. 2 (David Copperfield / The Pickwick Papers / The Old Curiosity Shop / Dombey and Son)",N/A
387636,"""The Usual Suspects"" is such a phenomenal story, with a great ensemble cast - what could be better than owning it on DVD? Well I'll tell you - owning the special edition on DVD. The special features on here are probably equal to the length of the movie itself, and offer really great insight into the director, editor, and cast. Extensive interviews with the key players reveal inside information that is fascinating. The gag reel is hysterical, and the bit of Del Torro ""getting stuck on words"" as Fenster alone is worth the price of the entire disc. The deleted scenes aren't as interesting as I'd hoped - I think the crew did a great job selecting what got left out.The plot is wonderful, involving a small crew of big- and small-time criminals and con-men who must work together to repay their individual debts to a mysterious man named Keyser Soze. Soze is a legend (some even say a myth,) whom many people believe to be the devil himself. He is ruthless, brutal, powerful and hugely successful. Pete Postlethewaite plays a wonderful attache for Mr. Soze, carrying off a bizarre combination of careful politeness edged by steely resolve. There aren't enough accolades for this whole cast, though - each actor does an incredible job of getting into his character's skin, and each man makes the viewer believe that he feels each and every little tic and itch his character would feel.The first time I saw this film, I confess that I was had - I honestly didn't know how it would end until The Big Reveal. I suspect it'll keep most people guessing. Even then, after knowing how it ends, watching it over and over again is still enjoyable, simply because of the details and hints to the truth one picks up. Plus, the characters are so engaging, and the chemistry between all of them works so well, it's just a supremely enjoyable ride every time. After having watched it perhaps 10 times, it's still something I pull out now and then.","The Usual Suspects, Letterbox Edition VHS"
34480,"THE GAY DIVORCE had been perhaps the most important stage musical of Fred Astaire's Broadway career.  Though out the 1920s, he had been the lesser half of the most famous dance team in American entertainment:  Adele and Fred Astaire.  Fred's sister, an enormously gifted comic dancer, had been the center of the act throughout their career, but when she retired to marry English royalty, Fred was placed in the position of needing to reinvent himself and salvage his career.  Somewhat unexpectedly, Fred's enormous success in THE GAY DIVORCE established him not just as a comic dancer, but as a romantic one as well.  An offer by Hollywood to come and remake the stage success as a film was accepted.Fred arrived in Hollywood, but his studio, RKO cast him in FLYING TO RIO before beginning THE GAY DIVORCE.  Although he was fifth billed and the third billed male, his dance numbers with a contract dancer RKO had just obtained from Warner Brothers, Ginger Rogers, were the hit of the film.  Against his wishes, RKO suggested casting Rogers in THE GAY DIVORCE because of their success as a team in FLYING TO RIO.  That was what Fred was afraid of:  a team.  He had just managed to break free from being thought of as the lesser half of Adele and Fred, and he was hesitant about a new partner.  But RKO won out and, as they say, history was made.THE GAY DIVORCE was quickly redubbed THE GAY DIVORCEE (the Hays office objecting that divorces could not be gay but were instead always unhappy affairs, although a divorcee could be).  Fred was given nearly complete artistic control of his dance numbers, and instead of the highly choreographed numbers popularized by Busby Berkeley at Warner Brothers, Fred argued for filming his scenes with cameras just barely above ground level, and as close to one shot as was possible.  The result was an emphasis not on visual pyrotechnics, but on the intimacy and emotions in the dance.The results were stunning.  Although most of the songs from the stage musical were jettisoned, the greatest was kept, and in many ways it remains one of the mythic numbers in the history of musical cinema:  Cole Porter's ""Night and Day.""  The number defined for all time what Fred and Ginger were all about.  Until this moment in the film, Fred had been futilely chasing Ginger, only to be rebuffed time and again.  But once he begins to sing ""Night and Day"" she begins to have a twinge of interest.  And once he grabs her arm and begins to dance with her, we manage to watch one of the great seduction scenes in the movies.  At the beginning of the song, she still has no interest in him; at the end of the dance, they are in love.  Although Ginger was never Fred's equal as a dancer, she was extraordinary in the manner in which she could respond emotionally to him in their dancing.  Their dancing is so very nearly like love-making that we are not at all surprised that as the dance ends, and Fred's gently spins and lowers Ginger onto a couch, he rocks back on his heels, reaches into his jacket, and pulls out his cigarette and offers one to her.  It is as perfect a moment as exists in film.THE GAY DIVORCEE succeeds primarily because of Fred and Ginger's incredible magic together, but it is also a delight because of the amazing comedic cast.  Erik Rhodes, a native of Tulsa, Oklahoma, had only two notable roles, both times as an Italian in two classic Astaire-Rogers films.  In this film and in TOP HAT, he manages to steal nearly every scene he is in.  Edward Everett Horton and Eric Blore both were so perfect in their roles that they reappeared in several other Astaire-Rogers films.  Alice Brady brings her classic insanity to the film.The film, of course, achieved Fred Astaire's worst fears, and gave him a new partner.  But given the incredible success of Astaire and Rogers, I don't think anyone believes that this was in any sense an unfortunate turn of events.",N/A
585284,"I loved this movie - they've done a great job of bringing the comicsonto the screen while also modernising it a bit. I also liked the waythey highlighted the importance of Mary Jane by making it 'her story'in a way.Another standout aspect was the way they showed Peter Parker coming toterms with his new-found gifts and learning how best to utilize them.His transformation into a crime fighter is also shown in a realisticmanner, rather than showing him as a guy who's always been geared toturn into Spiderman, and needs no 'breaking in' period or motivation.Toby Maguire turns in a winning performance as Peter Parker/ Spiderman,which should really turn him into a big, big star. Kirsten Dunst isattractive in a warm kind of way rather than ravishingly pretty. WillemDafoe proves yet again that he's capable of fine villanious performances.The other support actors are good, too.A special word for Sam Raimi, who's done an exceedingly good job ofadapting a popular superhero series for the silver screen, a feat notso easily achieved.The special effects, sets etc are all quite good and add to the impact.All in all, very well done indeed - i'll definitely watch the sequel !!",N/A
703435,"It's always a challenge to view a movie after it's garnered a few Oscars, because of the hype. If I could point one reason as to why this movie was so well received by the Academy, I would say it was the courage and abandon with which it went against the grain of New England (American?) conservatism (it's another conversation as to how such a simple concept of art should seem to innovative to Hollywood).The symbolism of a house, and the bedroom that separate the people living in it is strong -- they are physically together, but mentally stored away in different compartments... perhaps for good reason. Son Frank (Nick Stahl) is studying to be an architect, and drafts elaborate structures of dream houses in his room. Dad Matt (Tom Wilkinson, who is really the star of the film, despite what everybody says about co-star Sissy Spacek's performance) is a doctor who can't fix what's going wrong with his family this summer. Mom Ruth (Spacek) conducts hymns that doesn't salve her astute perceptions of the world. Yet because the symbolism is so strong, so apparent in every nook and cranny, its overabundance renders it somewhat contrived.The direction is exemplary, and if nothing else, the performances elevate the film a few notches above what it actually is. After the first tragedy of the movie strikes, the camera splices up scenes that mimick the on-screen relationship fragmentation, and by the time there's an abject role reversal between the parents, you get the feeling that the pieces won't come together again.",In the Bedroom
669541,"I originally rented the first season of the Sopranos on DVD and ended up watching all thirteen episodes over a two day period.  I went out and bought the second season as a Christmas present for myself and I am pleased to say it surpassed even my lofty expectations!The season starts out where the last one left off.  Tony's not talking to his mother, Uncle Junior's been arrested and is let out on house arrest, Big Pussy's is now an FBI informant, and Dr. Melfi's seeing patients in a motel.  But things get turned upsided down with the addition of two new characters:  Tony's sister Janice (aka Parvati) and Richie Aprile, the brother of the late former boss Jackie Aprile and Janice's former lover.  He's just been released from prison and is looking for a piece of the action, both from Tony and from Janice.I'm not going to spoil the season for you by running down every episode, but every episode, while self-contained, helps paint a piece of the larger picture of the season.  Everything is covered here from the relationship between Tony and Dr. Melfi to a friend's gambling problem to a power struggle at the type to a final farewell to a major player in the Sopranos.I know the high price might keep some people from buying the set, but it is well worth it!

690954,"A classic drama, with all of the traditional elements designed to pull at your emotions!  It has been some time since one had the use of such a broad cast of talented actors.  This particular cast's ability to make the audience believe in their characters really makes the difference in this film.Kevin Kline is in one of his best roles ever as the father who is given the chance to re-evaluate his life and family through the lens of his terminal illness.  Kristen Scott Thomas shines as Kline's ex-wife who realizes that her former husband really did care for her while they were married - and that his feelings have not changed.  Hayden Christensen brings incredible screen charisma and talent to his portrayal of Kline's disconnected son.  One can hope he is allowed to do the same with his role in the upcoming Star Wars: Attack of the Clones.Watching Kline deal with his illness is, obviously, the main point of the film.  How he deals with it, from a touching scene with a nurse early in the film, to his method for reaching into the abyss that has swallowed his character's son allows Kline to really showcase his superb acting talent.  It is unfortunate that the Academy did not acknowledge his performance when making the nominations this year - he certainly was up to Oscar standards.A fine ensemble cast rounds out the film, with such notables as Mary Steenburgen and Scott Bakula adding nice touches throughout.  Some interesting side stories keep the movie from bogging down, as some dramas often do.  It remains just the slightest bit unpredictable as it winds its way to the emotionally surprising, yet fulfilling ending.",N/A
496655,"Of all the many fine versions of Charles Dicken's immortal story &quot;Oliver Twist&quot; this excellent David Lean production surpasses all others in sheer excellence of presentation and in bringing to life the sad little tale of the young waif left to survive on his own in Victorian London.It would of course be totally pointless to retell what the story is about as doubtless all readers would be totally familiar with what is probably Dicken's most famous and well loved work. David Lean in his own unique style has here brought Dicken's words to life in a rich tapestry of excitement, danger, tragedy, menace and sentiment that can't be equalled.A stellar British cast has been assembled here and they literally become the characters as depicted in the pages of Dickens. Little John Howard Davies in later times a highly successful producer/director at Thames television is the absolute epitome of how Oliver should be. His performance is astonishingly mature and heartfelt and he brings just the right note of fear and longing for a better life into his interpretation of Oliver. I always in my mind think of him when I think of the character of Oliver Twist just as I would think of Vivien Leigh when describing Scarlett O'Hara, so convincing is he.The rest of the performances are top rank. Alec Guiness almost unrecognisable as the wily Fagin is spot on in his portrayal and his interpretation ranks as one of his finest performances ever. Robert Newton brings just the right level of menace and repulsiveness to his portrayal of Bill Sikes and Kay Walsh, a superb British actress with many memorable roles to her credit, is excellent in the sympathetic role of Nancy who in her own way tries to protect Oliver from a terrible fate among London's pickpockets. Henry Stephenson, long performing in some of the classic productions in Hollywood came home for the role of Mr Brownlow who is revealed as Oliver's grandfather and he is wonderful in one of the few sympathetic male roles in the film. Anthony Newley also is a standout in what proved to be probably his most famous role as the Artful Dodger. He has the correct cheeky and unflappable quality that Dicken's painted so vividly in the novel and he makes a wonderful contrast to Oliver's refined persona in their scenes together. Also look closely in the early tavern scenes for Diana Dors in a very early role as Charlotte the barmaid.The look of this production also has a real &quot;Dickens&quot; feel about it. The vivid black and white photography, the ghastly depiction of the grimy workhouse,  the stark settings in the undesirable sections of London, the dark lighting in many of the scenes and the crowded closed in feel of many of the scenes all combine to create just the correct sense of unease and undesirability that Dicken wanted to get across in this story.While the story of Oliver Twist is not really for the squeamish I feel most members of the family will enjoy the story and the film does bring in a very lovely ending when Oliver is finally reunited with his Grandfather.David Lean's &quot;Oliver Twist&quot; is a masterful achievement and is rightly regarded as a true classic today. I never tire of it and appreciate more and more things about this quality production with each viewing . If there is one version of this story that you get for your video collection make sure it is David Lean's 1948 version of &quot;Oliver Twist&quot;",N/A

14385,"The Big Hit sets out to be an &quot;In Your Face&quot; action-comedy, ultra violent gangster movie and it delivers. Can't be compared to Pulp Fiction or Goodfellas, but on its own, it is an entertaining film because all the characters and some of the situation devices are treated as a cartoon rather than a serious gangster flick. Mark Wahlberg, a mild mannered hitman, situated in middle suburbia, is forced to do a side job (a kidnapping)to make some quick cash to support a girlfriend and a fiance.  The kidnapping job goes all wrong, and that's when the absurdity of the movie goes into full gear and some hilarious slapstick action occurs. Lou Diamond Phillips shows off some comedic chops as the double crossing hit squad member and is one of the funniest characters in the movie.  Also, some funny moments with Lainie Kazan, Elliott Gould and Avery Brooks. Mark Wahlberg's mild mannered hit man is a surprise and has some nice moments with the kidnap victim (China Chow). Overall, a very entertaining film which should have been longer than 90 minutes. Also, the DVD has pretty good extras like Director/Producer commentary and deleted scenes.",N/A
34229,"This is unquestionably the great monster movie ever made.  The plot is not just an excuse for a monster to go on a rampage, the characters are unforgettable, and the special effects truly blow me away.  An overzealous producer named Denham embarks on a voyage to a secret location with the intent of shooting his most daring movie ever.  Forced to choose a leading lady at the last minute, he bumps into a down-on-her-luck young beauty, Ann Darrow (played by the gorgeous Fay Wray).  They reach the previously unknown island in the Pacific, encounter a group of natives who are less than pleased to see them, and verify Denham's story of a huge wall blocking off a section of the island.  Ann is kidnapped and left as an offering to King Kong, who makes his dramatic appearance halfway through the film.  The crew go after Kong, encountering such obstacles on their way as a giant dinosaur and sea monster.  Eventually, a subdued Kong is brought to New York City to be exploited for money; taunted by the sight of the woman he adores, Kong makes one last stand, and the ending is cinematic history.It is almost impossible to believe that this monumental epic was made in 1933.  The special effects are just amazing, much better than most monster movies of the last couple of decades.  I have no idea how Kong was &quot;created&quot; by the studio; while he is sort of herky-jerky in some of his movements, the detail of the stop-motion animation is incredible.  I took special note of the way even his nostrils twitch, and his facial movements are all very expressive.  I believe the incredible detail of Kong's features does much to make him such a creature worthy of sympathy.  You can see the pain in his face when he is hurt, and you can clearly see his affection for Ann Darrow.  I should also mention the fight scenes, which are some of the best ever produced.  These are prehistoric animals, and they fight the way prehistoric animals fight--going right after each other in a challenge of strength without any special powers or fiery breath rays.  Most stunning of all to me are the scenes taking place high up on jungle cliffs and later on the Empire State Building.  When you see the ground or the New York skyline and streets way down below, they look quite  real.  Even the most recent monster movies seem to fail miserably at showing their monster up above the landscape below.  I am also somewhat surprised at the level of horrific events in a movie from 1933--when men fall to their deaths, you see them fall and hear their screams stop abruptly when they hit the ground; when Kong fights another creature, victory is achieved in a rather gruesome manner; Kong often puts men inside his mouth and then throws them to their deaths.  I can't say enough about the realism of the special effects in this movie made almost seventy years ago now.No one screams like Fay Wray.  She is the perfect &quot;beauty&quot; for Kong's &quot;beast.&quot;  There is a philosophical tint to this movie, though: who is the real beast here?  Is it King Kong, who forsakes everything he has ever known to pursue the woman he loves?  I don't think so.  The true beast is the movie maker Denham, whose love for money, excitement, and glory brings destruction to a Pacific island and to the streets of New York.  If you've never seen the original movie, I urge you to see it.  King Kong is so much more than a monster movie.  The story is deeper than you might expect, and the whole experience marks a true watershed in the history of movie making.",N/A

HOWEVER, I believe all you Tolkein-heads who say the movie was close to the books.I guess for fans of the book, this was a good thing. For the rest of us, however, three and a half hours of fantasy is on the long side. By the third hour, I wanted to yell ""Haven't you guys heard of FedEx?!""That being said, I liked the rest of the movie. The acting, visual effects, music, and location choices were all top notch. For the first part of the movie, the story moved along at a good pace. When it hit hour two and a half, though, things began to bog down. Spending forty five minutes in one spot is something that most movies try to aviod.I would have rated this movie higher if the following had been done:1) Chop it down to 2.5 hours, or at least put a lull in the action half way through so I can go buy more food without missing anything2) The ending was a real bummer.

667937,"This video blew me away.  I mean, The Who were once rock'sgreatest live band, as their video/DVD ""Live At The Isle OfWight"", or their documentary ""The Kids Are Alright"" will attest.However, ever since Moon's death they have been struggling tofind an adequate replacement and for several years in the 90sTownshend stuck to acoustic playing in order to save hisbattered eardrums; add to this the atrocity that was the BroadwayTommy and I was ready to write off the band entirely.I couldn't have been more wrong: this show, taped in Nov 2000 as the bandmembers were in their late 50s, shows just as much explosive energy and excitement as anything they've ever done--if not more!  Daltrey's voice is as powerful as ever andnever wears out during the 2 1/2 hour performance, Entwistleis as virtuosic as ever (check out the ""5.15"" solo) and it'sgreat to see Townshend back to his windmills and high leaps onthe electric guitar.  Even better, the group have finally founda drummer who is reminiscent of the late great Moon, and it'snone other than Zak Starkey, Ringo's son.  He is their first drummer since Moon to actually propel the songs forward withan extra kick, and it's clear that he has studied Moon's stylewith meticulous care.  The result is a group that has beenre-energized to sound like they haven't since the mid-70s; it'sas if no time has elapsed at all in the 25 years since theirprime.  Another plus is that they keep the sound lean and meanwith just the four of them plus an excellent keyboardist--noneof the bloated extra musicians and backup singers that mar a lotof other dinosaur groups in their comeback tours (The RollingStones, anyone?).There are some guest artists, but these are mostly great: PaulWeller turns in a fine duet with Townshend on the overlookedclassic ""So Sad About Us"", Eddie Vedder serves up typicallypassionate performances of ""I Am One"" and ""Let's See Action"",Noel Gallagher contributes some fine guitarwork to ""Won't GetFooled Again""...and oh yes, Bryan Adams mangles ""Behind BlueEyes"" and some kid from The Stereophonics (Kelly Jones) triesto tackle ""Substitute"" but is outstaged by Daltrey's backup.Overall, though, the high points far outweigh the one or twomissteps: ""Magic Bus"" climaxes with a finale that blows the lidoff of even the Leeds or Wight versions, ""The Kids Are Alright""is doubled in length and includes a heartfelt new lyric, ""The Relay"" grooves and grooves, ""You Better You Bet"" is tight andpunchy, ""The Real Me"" and ""5.15"" are the best performances I'veever heard of these ""Quadrophenia"" numbers, and so on.  And although the newest song they play is from 1981, their backcatalogue is such that every single song they choose is a five-star masterpiece.  Unlike the flaccid, soulless and overly-choreographed recent tours by Pink Floyd, Fleetwood Mac or TheRolling Stones, there's still plenty of 70s-style improvisation and teenaged raw energy flowing their veins...The Who have outclassed every ""dinosaur"" band that ever was and kept theirlegacy intact.  Daltrey and Townshend both look in very highspirits throughout, as they take their audience on a tour through their early mod classics, progressive 70s work, maximumR&B; raveups, acoustic ballads and more.  Their music is suchthat the audience was comprised of people of all ages--teenagersand middle-age baby boomers equally shouted the lyrics with passionate abandon.  Considering that the bandmembers are now approaching 60, their seeming drink from the fountain of youthseems like a miracle.

104811,"Without a adoubt this 1958 film from Britain's Hammer Studios is THE BEST Dracula film ever made! Not a remake, loose or otherwise, of the Universal/Bela Lugosi film (as the notes on the DVD box states), but a completely new interpretation of Bram Stoker's novel. Christopher Lee and Peter Cushing are both brillant as Dracula and Dr. Van Helsing and the three women in the film (Melissa Stribling as Mina, Carol Marsh as Lucy and Valiere Gaunt as the vampire woman) are all great. For a film that was made for UNDER $200,000, the movie looks sumptuous. The framing on the anamorphic widescreen DVD appears a bit tight at the top and bottom with more information on each side, but the transfer is nice and bright, the picture is crystal clear and the colour is fine. The only extra is the original trailer (a little over 2 minutes long) and some poorly written notes on the Hammer/ Dracula series. A commentary with Chris Lee would have been nice or an interview, but anyone wanting to know Lee's views on the Dracula films could check out Anchor Bay's fine DVD releases of ""DRACULA, PRINCE OF DARKNESS"" or ""SCARS OF DRACULA"", if she or he hasn't already. But the film is the thing and I think too many DVD's lately have been loading TOO many extras on their disks and there is such a thing as overkill. All in all, a nice package.

When viewed on a widescreen tv the picture is cut off at the top and bottom (as one reviewer mentioned, Chris Lee's head is cut off in one scene). When Dracula is talking to Harker at the beginning on a 4x3 tv you see all of Lee's head but it is partially cut off on the widescreen tv.

We thought it was such a cool movie; I mean it had everything that every other movie we liked had (great sfx, cool monsters, a witty hero, car chase) plus it had a little bit of nudity (the female duck in the tub and the woman at the spa) and that made it even more cool. Little did we know that the movie tanked at the box office and sent George Lucas into hiding for awhile.Watching the film fifteen years later, I now understand why it failed. The movie tried to be a cool cartoony type 80's flick, but made for adults instead of kids. Boy, did they ever get it wrong. Everything good about the film appeals to the child in everyone (alien from outer space, good guy verses bad guy, goofy sidekick, car chase, etc.). On the other hand, everything that made the movie tank (the interspecies sexual innuendo, the people making out at the &#34;spa&#34;, &#34;PlayDuck&#34;, etc.) was the stuff that was supposed to appeal to the adult crowd. Now, had HOWARD's filmmakers focused on just appealing to kids, the movie would have been a lot better and would have probably gotten a bigger box office draw and would be more fondly remembered. Instead, it's thought of as one of the worst films of the 1980s, which is a shame because there was so much that could have been done to make this at least a decent movie. Anyway, the film's worth checking out just for how many times bad movies are compared to it. The strange hybrid it is will make you either hate it or enjoy it.",Howard the Duck VHS

552470,"This is a very powerful gay coming-out film, unlike others in its directness, simplicity and honesty. This is not a coming-out tale told thru rose-colored glasses. It's not a romance.""Edge of Seventeen"" depicts the coming-out of 17 year old Eric Hunter in Sandusky, OH, in 1984. The cast overall is not as stellar as, say, ""Beautiful Thing"" or ""Lilies,"" or several other very good gay films, but most of them have very minor roles, anyway. Of those that are crucial to the story, Chris Stafford deserves a statuette for his portrayal of Eric, nailing just about every nuance of emotion such a boy would go through, though he has a tendency to giggle at times when I think a soft moan would be more appropriate. Tina Holmes gives a wonderful performance as his steadfast girl friend, Maggie, and Stephanie McVay is excellent as Everymom. Lea Delaria perhaps brings some cachet to the film as a gay icon, but I would have preferred the role to be filled by a non-celebrity. Celebrity actors usually make better contributions to films if they play against type, if they have the acting skills to do it. Andersen Gabrych is creepily perfect as Rod, the college stud who knows Eric is attracted to him before Eric does and intends to use that knowledge to his personal satisfaction in every way he can.The directing, camera work and editing are accomplished if not exciting or groundbreaking. The 80s was a nothing decade for me musically, so the soundtrack does nothing for me.There are some rather explicit scenes, though nothing XXX; they will probably be a little discomforting for some straights and some gays, tho for different reasons.Unlike most gay films, the bad guys in ""Edge of Seventeen"" are not the homophobes, who are very inconsequential, nor a father who is unsupportive, nor any of the other usual suspects, but various gay characters, all too true to life, whom Eric encounters in his ""Summer of '84."" Number 1, of course, is Rod ('wham, bam, thank you little boy'). Number 2 is the predator who hits on Eric on his first visit to a gay bar ('wham, bam, slurp, ""Whatever""'). Then there are the various jaded queens at the bar, latter day 'Boys in the Band' wannabees who can't wait to have Eric find out what 'It's Really All About, sweetie.' We all know all these characters.Roger Ebert stupidly concludes Eric can't wait to be a slut. But Ebert is right that the film doesn't present a single positive male homosexual character.Nevertheless Eric survives his rites of initiation into the gay bar scene, and seems to be stabilizing happily at the end, which is otherwise a bit vague and cliche.The scenes in which Eric struggles with coming out to his Mom and then does are heart-rending and among the most moving in gay cinema, as is his coming out to Maggie.Despite my minor quibbles, I put this film on my very short list of 5-Star rated, excellent gay films. It is not to be missed. I will be looking forward to seeing more of Chris Stafford in future films, even if they're not about gay subjects.",Edge of Seventeen

24878,"An avalanche in a small European mountainside village causing train delays thrusts an odd conglomeration of travelers together in a rustic inn.  While waiting for the tracks to be cleared of snow, Margaret Lockwood playing a devil may care, soon to be betrothed young socialite befriends a sweet old matronly English governess, Miss Froy, played by Dame May Whitty.  Lockwood also has a rather unpleasant interaction with a boisterous and rambunctious music student played by Michael Redgrave.Once the transcontinental train is ready to embark, Lockwood and Whitty agree to travel together.  Prior to boarding Lockwood mysteriously gets clunked on the head by a wayward flowerpot causing a mild concussion.  Whitty attends to her in the train compartment coaxing her to fall asleep.  Lockwood awakens to find that the dear Miss Froy has apparently vanished.  Shockingly the passengers sharing her compartment disavow any knowledge of Miss Froy's existence.  Startled, Lockwood implores the obnoxious Redgrave to help her unravel the disappearance.Paul Lukas playing a Czech brain surgeon assures Lockwood that the episode is a mere figment of her imagination.In reality Miss Froy is an undercover British agent in possesion of sensitive pre-war military secrets.  Lukas is the foreign spymaster attemting to kill her before the message can be delivered.Although not one of Hitchcock's super classics, The Lady Vanishes is a wonderful example of his genius. He nimbly transforms what begins as a screwball madcap comedy into a tension filled suspense thriller.  His camera angles are unparalleled.  The revelation of the face an imposter dressed exactly in Miss Froy's clothes when you expect to see the face of Whitty is a vintage Hitchcock twist",N/A

The movie is great, a little confusing the first time you see it, since the most recent scene in the movie was in something like 1979. So if you think that it is happening in the present, it is not.Told through a series of flashbacks, as well as a quick-paced front-story, the movie has a great flow to it.The soundtrack is simply amazing.

540420,"Artificial Intelligence is not the warm fuzzy family fare early trailers would have led its audience to expect.  It is not merely the retelling of Pinocchio, although comparisons to Pinocchio are inevitable.  Neither is it merely the postmodern fantasy of a director of the surreal.Artificial Intelligence is a Siddartha-esque journey film, a story of a quest for identity and the meaning of life, and to a lesser degree, the documentary of some of the more important symbols of our cultural understanding of those questions.  The film's design and cinematographics draw from the dark and beautiful tradition of Blade Runner, while the semiotics put comparisons to The Fisher King in mind.Was it good?  If you are the kind of person who likes to read Joseph Campbell and rummage for meaning in the junkyard of contemporary film, you'll love this movie.

234860,"I first recall seeing this movie many years ago on ""The Creature Double Feature"" out of Boston. The scariest moment for me has to be when one of our heroes is attacked by a sneaky ant in the ant's storm drain nest. After many years (and sleepless nights!), I have long since come to love this little gem.While the idea of giant ants may seem silly, the film pulls it off with surprising flair. The ants are certainly a bit dated, but even so, they are just real enough to make the unbelievable believable. There's great suspense built up throughout, culminating in an ant beat-down beneath a major metropolitan city. One of the most famous action scenes in sci-fi film history occurs here when a giant ant crashes through a wall and attacks a ship's radio operator. One of our heroes even goes mano e mano with a giant ant in close-quarters combat when he's cut off from help by a cave-in. If you aren't on the edge of your seat by then, you must be comatose!James Arness (Marshal Dillon on ""Gunsmoke"") plays FBI agent and hero Robert Graham. James Whitmore plays New Mexico police officer Ben Peterson, who first uncovers the mystery of the giant ants. Edmund Gwenn is probably best known to fans as Kris Kringle in the seminal holiday film ""Miracle on 34th Street"". Here, he plays a dottering old scientist who provides info on ants and their behavior.There are some lighter moments despite the danger posed by the giant ants. Besides fun banter between the characters, Gwenn has an amusing encounter using a military radio, and later, unintentional comedy occurs when scientists mark giant ant sightings on a map using black flags (""Black Flag"" is the brand name of a popular insecticide).For all of the wonderful extras and menu design, the fan of ""THEM!"" will be disappointed with the lack of behind-the-scenes info on the film. For example, some production notes explaining that the film was originally supposed to be shot in Technicolor, but could not be due to the high cost would have been nice (the title card is in blazing red, the only use of color in the film). Also, information on the special coloring of the ant props in anticipation of the Technicolor shoot would have been informative (they were painted red and green). There are few if any behind the scenes shots showing how the ants were operated, which would have been nice. I have to go with four stars due to the lack of more info on the film, but the transfer is tack sharp, and the ants sound as spooky as ever (no info on the sound effects in the extras, either).There are a surprising number of known faces in this film besides Mr. Gwenn, Mr. Whitmore, and Mr. Arness. Leonard Nimoy, forever famous as Mr. Spock on ""Star Trek"" has an early role here, walking on as a radio man who discusses a ""flying saucer"" sighting with a secretary. Also look for Fess Parker of Davy Crockett fame as the pilot who reports the giant ant-shaped ""saucers"". The well-known character actor William Schallert pops up as an ambulance attendant. Schallert appeared in countless cameos in television and films, and is probably best known for playing Patty Duke's father on ""The Patty Duke Show"". You may also spot Dub Ta ylor as a railway guard. Taylor was a staple of western films, and he's sure to be familiar. If you look quick, you'll also spot Richard Deacon, who went on to play Mel Cooley, the uptight producer (and target for Morey Amsterdam's jokes), on ""The Dick Van Dyke Show"".""THEM!"" is a landmark sci-fi/horror film, and set the standard by which all other giant radiation-mutated bug movies must be judged by. You'll never quite look at ants again in the same way after watching this film. The effects are still good even today, and the ants can still creep you out despite being fifty years old!",Them VHS

Acker Bilk and His Paramount Jazz Band are very entertaining, as are the proto-Spice Girls act The Three Bells.The audio commentary by Spensor Davis and Martin Lewis is informative not only about the making of the film, but also about the music scene happening in the UK at that time.

585330,"This was possibly the most highly-anticipated comic book movie adaptation ever, next to the X-Men, and it may have taken years to bring this about, but it is definitely worth the wait.  initially I wasn't sure who they were going to cast in the title role, but when I heard the name Tobey Maguire, I initially scratched my head in confusion, considering the fact that I would've never thought that a guy like him would take part in something like this, given his Hollywood track record.  But after this, I don't think I would picture anyone else as Peter Parker.  He really brings the character to life, embodying many of the deep qualities we love and admire from the comics and the cartoon, but in a majorly human way.  Kirsten Dunst was excellent as Mary Jane, I initially thought she would play Gwen Stacy, Spider-Man's FIRST love interest, but then I saw that Kirsten had dyed her hair, so it pretty much indicated that MJ was in this film.  this movie was excellent on so many levels, it was intelligent, it was funny, it was touching, it was dramatic, it was action-packed, everything you would love in a movie.

674328,"...this movie was a huge mistake. The audience I saw it with was largely quiet and seemed as uninvolved in it as I was. About the only thing going for it is the vocal talent (Rock, Fishburne, Pierce, Shatner) but even that ended up being disappointing.The concept just doesn't work. There's a major disconnect between the live action sequences with Frank (Bill Murray) in the real world (which make up perhaps 1/3 of the movie) and the animated sequences of what's going on inside his body. For me, this very cartoony anthropomorphic world of his internal organisms (the animation design reminds me of the Simpsons a little bit) just cannot possibly exist at all in the real world...yet we are supposed to believe that Frank's white blood cells look like Smurf/Bart Simpson hybrids and sound like Chris Rock...it was just impossible for me to suspend my disbelief as the film cuts back and forth between these two completely different universes.That said, I guess the filmmakers do what they can with it, the way they visualize the city of Frank (the inhabitants refer to his brain as Cerebellum Hall, the armpits are where all of the evil bacteria and viruses hang out and veins are shown as busy highways) is somewhat clever but, again, entirely too fantastic to exist in the real world. And then when these wholly disparate worlds collide, and the animated micro-organisms are literally travelling from one person to another AND THEN BACK AGAIN via phlegm and tears in the real world...well, that's when the impossible becomes TOTALLY LUDICROUS.And it doesn't help that all of the live-action actors (notably Murray, Molly Shannon and Chris Elliott) appear to just be collecting paychecks. Murray has achieved a new low here...I enjoyed his recent turns in `Rushmore' and `Charlie's Angels' but this is just plain embarrassing for him. The Farrelly brothers just must've told him to be as disgusting and slovenly as possible, which is fine I guess but that's all he has to do in this and what a waste of his talent. And the result is we just don't care about his character...he's repugnant and an idiot. So what if the Thrax (the virus) causes him to die? The audience feels no sympathy towards Murray and that is the fatal flaw of the film.And really, I expected more of Rock...there are a couple of scenes where it looks like he was able to improvise and do his thing but for the most part the filmmakers keep him on a pretty short leash and stick to the script, and I really think that an opportunity may have been missed there. Used properly, I think Rock could do great voice-overs for animated films.Oh yeah, one more thing...why can't a comedic film come out without some dumb film parody in it? You've seen the action in the Matrix parodied a million times already...well add another attempt (very feeble at that) to the list. It's really getting annoying, and pedestrian animated films like this one really have no new insights to add as far as that parody goes. They should leave that to more insightful programs such as Simpsons and South Park.One final note...I had this weird feeling when I walked out of the theater...as if the film just didn't work, and I knew the movie reminded me of another, but I couldn't remember what at first. Then it came to me...remember `The Last Action Hero'? That film left me with that same feeling, because Arnold Schwarzenneggar plays the role of a movie character that comes to life in the real world. It was just totally impossible to believe and renders the film - no matter how well it's done and how well everything else is conceived - toothless. And Osmosis Jones falls flat for the same reason.

693336,"Much has been said about the miserable story and acting elements of Star Wars Episode I, and Episode II has fallen even deeper into the spiral.This entry is inferior even to Episode I on all fronts.  Narratively, Episode II is a complete mess, a hodgepodge of thin characters, some vague sense of a conspiracy, and logical aberrations (for example, why would Jango Fett be the basis of the clones?).  The ending, where the writers arbitrarily give the good guys a massive army to win the day, is especially ridiculous.Visually there is nothing to match the stunning pod race of Episode I, which was a knockout even on the small screen.  Attack of the Clones is slow, ponderous, with action sequences that don't pass the mustard at all.  Part of that problem is the fact that without the gallant Liam Neeson (not to mention not a single character comparable to the cast of the original Star Wars films), there isn't a character sympathetic enough to make me interested.  Natalie Portman and Hayden Christenson give completely wretched performances; Christenson is even more annoying and shallow than Jake &quot;I'm so cute&quot; Lloyd in Episode I, succeeding in soiling the character of Anakin Skywalker/Darth Vader even more.  *Now* it should be easy to think of Darth Vader as a &quot;crusty old man&quot;, in Kevin Smith's words.  But at least Christenson can claim inexperience -- Portman's failure is even more despicable considering she's been acting for nine years now, and she's been progressively getting worse.  Since the entire film is supposed to focus on this relationship, the atrocious performances of the two actors just sinks the film.  Ewan McGregor is even more crippled than in the first film.  Obi-Wan has become a thoroughly stoic, uninteresting character here, thus preventing McGregor from putting in the youthfulness and exuberance as in Episode I.  His turn in Episode II ranks as his stiffest, most inexpressive performance ever -- he's better than that.I would have enjoyed this film a little more if the action sequences and visual spectacles could match up.  No luck.  Without the acrobatic wizardry of Ray Park, who as Darth Maul had been Episode I's secret weapon, Episode II's action elements are simply not interesting.  The sight of the rows of clones and droids stops being impressive awfully quickly.  In the end, there's only one scene that works -- Yoda's lightsaber duel with Count Dooku.  And even then, the idea is better than the execution.  George Lucas misses a chance to wow us here; instead of designing a lightsaber duel that mounts and builds, he's content to let Yoda flip around for about 30 seconds, then get out without any sense of conflict or tension.  It looks pretty neat, but there's no emotional impact.Episode II is playing in New York right now in IMAX format, but I'm glad I saved my money and rented it.  There's nothing here that a bigger screen format can rescue from the junk pile.  It seems Lucas has one more shot at preventing himself from completely despoiling his Star Wars legacy, but I have a nasty feeling Episode III will once again disappoint.  A crushing, ignominious bookend to a pop-culture legend.",N/A

Yet, one day while I was in Blockbuster's, I was looking for something to watch on DVD and came across this. There wasn't nothing new there that I hadn't seen except for this. So, I thought...""Well, what have you got to lose but a few dollars?"" and I ended up renting it. Boy, I'm glad I did. The show was a blast to watch. To be honest, I wasn't even a fan of Sarah Michelle Gellar til I saw this DVD collection of the first seasons' episodes. My favorite episode has to be the last episode on Disc 3 where Buffy dies and is brought back. I really enjoyed the collection and aim on making it part of my DVD collection.

586677,"Kevin Spacey is pure genius.  Jeff Bridges is rather impressive himself.  Having seen this movie before I read the book, I could easily see these people in the roles in the book.  I thought the adaptation of the script was rather respectful to the book.  Though not perfect, and missing a main character, the movie really did get the book's mystery across rather successfully.  The thing I liked about the movie, is the fact that it isn't as one sided as the book.  The book is written in first person from the perspective of the Jeff Daniels character, the psychologist named ""Dr. Mark Powell"".  A film obviously is much more difficult to work in this fashion.  The movie is warmer than the book too, which is a plus.Anyway, enough about the book.  The movie revolves around a psychologist who gets a new patient who calls himself ""prot"" (rhymes with goat).  ""prot,"" is either an alien from the planet K-PAX or he is a convincing delusional.  With ""prot's"" scheduled departure date, Bridges character ""Dr. Powell,"" is in a race against time to find out ""prot's"" real identity, if he has an identity at all.  ""prot"" influences many of those who are institutionalized at the Manhattan Psychiatric Institute, as well as much of the staff, as he promises that he will take one of them home with him to K-PAX.  That's all I can say without giving anything away.  I have no interest in spoiling such a wonderful story.The movie moves very well.  I love the character interaction.  The cast is pure gold.  Kevin Spacey is remarkable as usual.  There isn't really anything bad about this movie at all.  And any nitpicking that I would point out, however trivial, would be a spoiler.  I will just have to ask you to trust my judgment that this movie is fun, brilliant, and rather captivating.  Rent it once, and you'll buy it.  I don't think you will be disappointed.epc",N/A

When I saw it, after catching Mel Brooks on the Tonight Show in 1968, (see, I _TOLD_ you it was a good year for movies!) as he was promoting it, I wasn't ready for the Mel Brooks grab-bag of crazy ingredients, this being my very first movie by him. First, there's the classic Broadway funnyman Zero Mostel in the lead as Max Bialystok, then there's Gene Wilder in one of his two funniest roles as the wildly neurotic Leopold Bloom. THEN there's Lee Meredith!(Will somebody PLEASE tell me why this girl's career didn't take off??) WOW! Talk about all-girl!! If estrogen ever had a good sales rep, it's her! ""Wife not up to snuff? Give her 'Essence of Lee' and watch the change come over her....?""

Doesn't happen, and they have to pay a bunch of little old ladies TWENTY THOUSAND PERCENT of what they took in from them, having sold improbable portions of the play to their victims!One of the most outrageous production numbers on Earth is the trademark ""Springtime For Hitler"" play-within-a-movie that features a June Taylor Dancers overhead shot of the cast forming a swastika, and a hippie, (played by Dick Shawn, a man BORN to be a rock DJ,) playing Adolf himself. The theatre audience reaction shots alone are almost worth the price of admission. Oh, I forgot to mention, ""Mr. Belvedere"", Christopher Hewett, plays a rather flamboyantly gay theatre director in this movie, which may explain why his TV show never got beyond 90 in the ratings!This is one of the top five funniest films ever made, and you may NEVER hear an argument against that....!",Producers VHS

422211,"One of the most oft-repeated cliches of the pro choice movement is the line ""men shouldn't have any say over abortion or a woman's body.""  Well, director Payne and his co-scenarist Jim Taylor have a LOT to say about abortion, women's bodies and the issues of individuals versus groupthink.I loved this movie!  Laura Dern is genuinely funny and quirky as the slow-witted Ruth Stoops, who finds herself at storm center as a judge convicts her of criminal negligence to her unborn fetus. However, out of court, he advises her to ""take care of this problem,"" sotto voce telling her to get an abortion.  Ruth doesn't really care; she just wants to find some Krylon or airplane glue to inhale.Finding herself in jail, some Christian pro-lifers take her under their wing.  Suddenly, she is no longer a rational actor whose free will determines the birth of her baby, but a pawn in a PR war between pro-life and pro-choice zealots.  It is as if Ruth doesn't even exist as an individual, and is only important to these fanatics as a poster child for their respective causes.What I most love about the characterisations of the activists is how Payne shows how removed they are from reality.  The pro-lifers (Mary Kay Place and that guy from That 70s Show) are Christian evangelicals who won't even have a TV in their house, hold independent church services at their house and sing horrifyingly bad hymns like ""Yes Jesus Loves Me, The Bible Tells Me So"" (this hokum is probably the main reason people become atheists; whatever happened to church hymns by Bach or Cesar Franck?)  Their clothes are right out of the Monkey Wards 1977 catalogue and they speak in that anti-intellectual sing-song style.The pro-choicers are just as big a scream.  Swoosie Kurtz plays a ""double agent"" who spends months undercover as a tacky Christian hick in order to kidnap one of the women whose pregnancy the pro-lifers intend to bring to term.  Once she has Ruth at her house, the wig comes off and she becomes her real self, a somewhat butch lesbian with a bookish feminist lesbian lover.  I love the scene when they sing a moon hymn to Gaia.Eventually, this boils over into a national media circus, and we get a couple of campy cameos from Burt Reynolds as President of the Baby Savers and my own Hitchcock goddess, Tippi Hedren as the President of Pro-Choice.Of course, Payne's message is the REAL pro-choice message, that the rights of individuals are what should be protected, not the groupthink of movement activists, whose lives would be empty without having a cause to blindly follow.  This movie shows the ultimate disdain and disrespect such groups have for rational, individual choice and common sense.  Payne's moral center of the movie is a Vietnam vet and biker who -- though a fervent pro-choicer -- sees through the zealotry of both sides and treats Ruth as an individual, and gives her the ""tough love"" she needs, instead of patronising her.One of the things I like about this movie is that Payne presents us with _sincere_ activists, who make pretty good points for both sides.  And that's where most Americans are; they're not _absolutely_ pro-life nor _absolutely_ pro-choice.  But, reaching that point-of-view would take THOUGHT, which most rabid activists are incapable of.I found this VHS (could not find DVD) is only available used, and is currently not in print.  How sad!  I hope Miramax is planning a new release.  I have this movie on LaserDisc, and what a great introduction to Payne's ascerbic wit and keen visual sense that comes to full fruition in ""Election.""",Citizen Ruth VHS
688780,"Debuting as a mid-season replacement series on January 12, 1971, All in the Family became one of the most influential comedies in TV history and made an immediate impact on the entire television industry. The sitcom revolves around blue-collar worker Archie Bunker (played by the beloved Carroll O'Connor) and his family. A bigot, Archie makes no bones about his racial and political views. His wife Edith, who he refers to as Dingbat, is ditzy, but her sweetness and good heart provide a perfect balance for the harsh character of Archie. Also residing in the Bunker house is Archie's daughter Gloria and her husband Michael. Some of the greatest commentary and comedic moments come from the verbal sparring between the narrow-minded Archie and the thoughtful, liberal Meathead.In this collection, you'll be getting the following episodes:1. ""Meet The Bunkers""- It's Archie and Edith's wedding anniversary, so Gloria and Mike try to whip up a party atmosphere for them.2. ""Writing the President""- Upon learning that Mike has written a letter of criticism to President Nixon, Archie becomes so upset that he writes a letter of his own in praise of Nixon.3. ""Oh, My Aching Back""- Archie tries to sue for whiplash after a minor auto accident and seeks out a Jewish lawyer to fight the case for him.4. ""Archie Gives Blood""- Archie becomes a blood donor, but he insists on knowing who the blood will be going to because his theory is ""black blood"" is different from ""white blood.""5. ""Judging Books By Covers""- Archie ridicules one of Mike and Gloria's friends for being gay.6. ""Gloria's Pregnancy""- Archie goes through the ceiling when he finds out that Gloria is going to have a baby and Mike has no means of supporting the child.7. ""Mike's Hippie Friends Come To Visit""- Mike invites a young couple to spend the night at the Bunker house, but runs into objections when Archie finds out the visitors are not married.8. ""Lionel Moves Into The Neighborhood""- Archie tries to prevent a black family from moving into his neighborhood. The family turns out to be the Bunkers' friend Lionel Jefferson and his parents.9. ""Edith Has Jury Duty""- Over Archie's objection, Edith accepts a call to serve on a jury hearing a murder case which may keep her away from home for weeks.10. ""Archie Is Worried About His Job""- Archie spends a sleepless night worrying because he thinks he's about to lose his job.11. ""Gloria Discovers Women's Lib""- Gloria discovers Women's Lib and winds up moving out of the Bunker household after an argument with Mike during which she demands that he treat her as an equal.12. ""Success Story""- After Eddie Frazier, a wealthy friend of Archie's, arrives from Beverly Hills, Archie organizes a reunion of their old army buddies.13. ""The First And Last Supper""- At the same time that Archie is circulating a petition to keep more black families from moving into the neighborhood, Edith accepts an invitation to have dinner with the Jeffersons. So, Archie tries to get out of the engagement by claiming Edith has sprained her ankle.",N/A
595372,"Shame for a director who puts himself on the map with the Sixth Sense goes on to swing and miss with Unbreakable and now rather dissapoints with Signs. Perhaps the order of his movies should've been exactly the other way around because now he's becoming a ""take cover, the new film from Shyamalan is out"" proposition.Shame twice because ""Signs"" could have been a great film and only because someone forgot to hire a script writer the film it was not.But i'd rather start with the positives. Despite the incredible plot holes i actually enjoyed this b-flick. I enjoyed it because :a)Mel Gibson, after years of pointless trash films (culminating with the ultra silly What Women Want recently) finally plays a role in which he does not annoy. Now that is news.b) Because the film holds throughout its b-movie atmosphere and not since the superb Jeepers Creepers about a year ago have i seen a film that maintains its b-movieness in such a convincing way. Why is that good? Because it helps you forget this is Hollywood.c) Because most of the characters (except the aliens, sadly) are pretty ok and for the most part humorous.But that's where the candy runs out:1. The aliens come through as dumb as a wall. I wont give away why (for those that havent seen the film) but man, this must be the sorriest alien invasion ever conceived by anybody on film or not. It's a joke to even call it an invasion. It aint even a farce. What it is is a bunch of aliens full of phobias trying to save their skin and get back home to their sofas.2. The gapping holes in the script never let up. They go on from the beggining of it and last through to the very (bad) ending. It becomes worse when one thinks that these scenario lapses were perfectly avoidable. Classic case of ""what was the script writer thinking???"" But, like i said, there wasnt any script writer. I do have the lingering suspicion that Mel wrote the story himself (in which case everything becomes explainable).3. The ending, and particularly, the last 30 seconds of the film classify it as a ""bomb"". You need talent to invent an ending as bad as this. Or you need to be working in Hollywood too long. Even if this film had been a great film (and it had massive potential to be) the ending would've totally destroyed it. Utterly unconvincing, and totally beyond the obligatory film-ruining ""happy ending"", it left me with a feeling of disgust.All in all, and in one word: pity.",Signs

12354,"There is  perhaps no novel as gripping or emotionally draining as Victor Hugo's Les Mis&eacute;rables, the story of redemption, overzealous fundamentalism (justice at all costs) and selfless heroism. Which is probably why it has been translated into numerous languages, and portrayed on Broadway, television, and by Hollywood a dozen times over. Jean Valjean has been brought to the screen by many actors, but perhaps none with quite the charisma and on-screen passion of Liam Neeson, the Oscar-nominated actor from ""Schlinder's List."" With an ideal, stunning cast, a gorgeous soundtrack, and a premise that should touch even the most hardened of hearts, Les Mis&eacute;rables is a triumph.If you worship the book, this adaptation may fall flat... but for this viewer, who had never before seen the story of Jean Valjean (and who now has become a fan of both book and film) this is a masterpiece. The story is spellbinding... Jean Valjean has spent nineteen years at hard labor in a French prison for stealing a loaf of bread. Released but still in bondage by a yellow passport that brands him as a convict, he travels the lonely roads of France seeking for redemption. Turned away by all the inns, he finds a place of safety and solace within the church, and by the hand of a compassionate old Bishop. But Valjean has grown hard and cruel in prison, and he betrays the man by thieving his silver and stealing away in the night. Fate, however, is not upon his side. He is caught and returned to the judgment of the church. But instead of judgment, he receives mercy... and a new lease on life.But the past returns to haunt him in the figure of Inspector Javert, a merciless and overly-zealous member of the Paris prefix. Valjean, who has become the mayor of the small but prosperous town of Vigau, is able for a time to conceal his real identity... but Javert suspects and begins to seek information to use against him. This isn't even traversing into the side plot, the prostitute Fantine and her abused daughter Cosette, who is forced to work as a slave at an inn. To them Valjean will be tied... his fate bound with their own by a simple act of compassion.What unfolds through the two-plus hour epic is a touching story of renewed faith and moral strength in a time of revolution and cruelty. Valjean and Javert are two men of conviction. But in one there is an allowance for human failings; in the other, no exceptions are made. It has romance, suspense, action, a stunning soundtrack, and unforgettable performances. My first viewing left me in utter astonishment, captivated by the story that unfolded before me, managing to touch me so deeply that it has since retained a place of honor in my film case. It's a tale of compassion, honesty, transformation, morality, and forgiveness that might not adhere exactly to Victor Hugo's original but still leaves one with a sense of having spent two unforgettable hours in France.

444356,"Years ago after my first visit to Egypt, the University of Minnesota sponsored a film festival of Egyptian made films and this was one among them.  Although it features film stars with whom many of us will already be familiar, Irene Pappas, Anthony Quinn and Michael Ansara, it was directed by a Moslem director,  Moustapha Akkad, and has the stamp of approval of the Al Azhar Mosque and University (the oldest University in the world and an institution much respected in the Islamic world for its Koran scholarship).While it carries a religious message for Islamic people--in fact I saw parts of it again on Saudi TV as part of the Ramadan season's celebration while I  was working in Tabouk--it also explains in a sympathetic way for Western viewers many of the basic tenets of Islam.  It is as moving a story in its own way as the stories of the New Testament are for Christians, and it portrays the essence of what Moslems believe about Mohamed and their faith.  The simplicity and straight forwardness of the tale as it portrays the sacrifices of plain people for their convictions and the ultimate triumph of good over evil will appeal to anyone with a sense of fair mindedness regardless of ones religious convictions.  The light in which it places Christians cannot fail to impress.  Mohamed's more vulnerable followers are told to seek asylum with the King of Abyssinia (modern day Ethiopia), because as a Christian king he was their ""brother"" and bound by the ""book"" to protect them from their oppressors, which indeed he does!  Nor are the Jews spoken ill of in the tale.The actual cinematography is a little dated, and the story can be a little postured, but no more than any other film of the 1960-1970s.  How many can sit through a John Wayne western without a little smile, whether of nostalgia or of amusement, and yet the color, pageantry and triumph of the good guys in the face of blatant evil is still a treat.

702984,"Like many shows, MYSTERY SCIENCE THEATER 3000 had its mix of good and bad episodes.  While it's not the best installment ever made, THE CRAWLING HAND still manages to be somewhat entertaining, thanks mostly to some appallingly bad puns and a movie goofy enough to be hilarious on its own.It's something of a clich&eacute; in terrible science fiction movies to have dismembered body parts wandering around on their own.  In this movie, as you may have guessed from the title, it's a hand (actually most of an arm) that has the ability to jump around killing people long after the rest of its body has been blown up.  In addition to strangulation, it may also have the ability to turn mild-mannered, boring teenagers into zombies, though not made clear is whether the arm really has this power, or if this is some sort of side-effect of the Bad-Science Space Radiation.The mocking of the film is done fairly well, but this is an early episode and the gang isn't quite at the mastery of the form they would achieve in later seasons.  There are a few major periods of silence during the movie, and this forces us to pay more attention to the film itself, which is almost never a good thing in MST3k.

691658,"NOVOCAINE provides a new perspective on the annual dental check-up. Steve Martin plays Dr. Frank Sangster, a successful dentist content with his practice and the love of his oral hygienist, Jean (Laura Dern). Well, maybe he's just a little bored. One day, Frank gains a new patient, the bewitching Susan (Helena Bonham Carter). During an after hours appointment, her smoldering question, ""Have you done it in The Chair"", causes Doc to use a drill of another sort. Unfortunately, as many men can ruefully corroborate, the failure to keep it zipped under stress has consequences. In Frank's case, they include suspicion of drug dealing and arrest for murder. And what were his teeth marks doing all over the corpse?NOVOCAINE is somewhat reminiscent of the 1985 film noir AFTER HOURS. In both, the hero finds his life going down the toilet due to bizarre circumstances beyond his control.  However, in the former, the plot is darker and the humor has a harder edge. Indeed, NOVOCAINE is often more drama than comedy. Having made his reputation as a comedian, Steve Martin is remarkably deadpan serious in his role as the foil for the, um, more interesting characters that have forced their way into Sangster's life. Scott Caan, regrettably on screen all too briefly, is chillingly menacing as Susan's psycho brother, Duane. Kevin Bacon is excellent as the actor spending time with the police department to absorb local color for an upcoming gig. Carter has the meatiest role as the strung-out and abused, but basically good-hearted, Susan. And Laura Dern, always a Babe worth an ogle, is effective as Frank's understanding girlfriend. Maybe too understanding, come to think of it.Sangster's solution to his growing list of problems is this quirky film's weirdest touch. It's not something you'd want to try at home when flossing just isn't enough.",N/A
95468,"I had not seen WWE for more than 25 years.  I remember it as a SF movie that shook me to my core. Even then, most movies did not begin with a framing sequence, but this one had the audacity to place the upcoming action in centuries-jumping sequence that quickly and convincingly landed the actors in the far future of an earth ruined by atomic war.  As a child, I had just read, Wells' 'The Time Machine' and I connected the similarities: the handsome travelers (one of whom,by the way, was Rod Taylor, star of the 1960 'The Time Machine);the division of humanity into the intelligent but weak humans who are threatened by the savage Morlocks; the abundance of tall, sexy women who could appreciate Rod Taylor's beefcake (Yvette Mimeux in 'The Time Machine' and Nancy Gates in 'WWE'; and the struggle between the two races of a divided humanity.  Still, WWE was more than just 'The Time Machine' reborn.  Despite the hokey special effects, it became clear that WWE was not a movie of special effects.  The focus was on people adjusting to a colossal change in their lives.  The time travelers had to learn to adjust to the loss of their known civilization. The weakened humans had to learn to adjust to a savage reminder of their past in the pistol packing personas of the time travelers.  And even the mutated beasts had to learn that with the death of their fearsome leader Naga, a new dawn of human reconciliation had begun.  The closing scenes of the unity of pre-war man, post-war man, and mutated man still resonate with me.  I could sense that humanity might yet survive the horror of atomic war.  WWE was one of the first intelligent post-apocalyptic films to suggest that our civilization need not take the detour that the Mad Max films would later travel.",World Without End VHS

I liked ""TERROR IS A MAN"", the first of the series directed by Gerry DeLeon. I DID NOT like ""Mad Doctor of Blood Island"" and I havn't seen ""The Blood Drinkers"" so my point of view is rather limited. However, after some shaky credits, ""Brides"" becomes a low-budget but colorful exercise in perverted exotica. The characters are not defined enough to really care about except Carla(Beverly Hills) the scientist's over-sexed wife who is merely around for eye candy. ""The Evil One"" is a decidedly lumpy looking monster who tears the female victims apart to ""satisfy humself""!!! There is virtually no blood or gore (save for a few limbs here and there) and the island seems to be alive with carnivorous plant life due to radiation exposure. There's a lot of running around and some scientific mumbo-jumbo that is none too convincing. However, I enjoyed it because parts of it were so damn ludicrous it was laugh out loud funny and it IS a colorful diversion from the 1968 drive-in period. Plus there's something to be said for the nice on location shooting that gives it that steamy feeling of being in the jungle. And, when all is taken care of in the end, you get a near orgy as the natives celebrate their freedom from the beast---sexed up to the max! As if they're saying ""Great! We're free! Let's all have sex right now!"" You've got to see this to believe it. Actually, you should see the whole thing to believe it.

224717,"I am a long time Marilyn fan...BR>One can imagine my excitement when I found out about this awesome collection of some of Marilyns' movies on dvd...  I had always loved this film because Marilyn was in it, and it is her greatest performance on screen.  She was amazing in this, even if the storyline is sometimes corny and just downright silly.  Marilyn makes this movie so watchable.She had taken a break from 20th Century fox before she made this, and after taking classes at the famous ""actor's studio"" in NYC, she formed her own production company.  I think her whole way of acting changed after these ""method acting"" classes, and ""Bus Stop"" was the first production to showcase this.As far as the dvd goes, it is so much better than it ever looked on television.  If you check out the extras you will get the chance to see a comparision.  To the naked eye, it is utterly amazing what work went into restoring the tale of Cheree' and that ol' bully cowboy, Beauregard Decker, played by Don Murray.It doesn't have as many extras as ""The Seven Year Itch"", which is the best of all the MM dvd's, but it's worth owning just to be able to see Marilyn at her finest work.Marilyn really got into this role.  I remember reading that she would stay in her hillbilly ""chanteuse"" character off the set, and it drove the rest of the crew crazy.  That pasty white complexion, that hillbilly accent, and those little costumes of hers were all just brilliant additions to the outstanding, brilliant acting work that she does in this.""Bus Stop"" is mostly dramatic but has some true comedic momments thrown in, and it's also another movie she sings -- ""That Ol' Black Magic"" is sung by her in that lilting drawl, whilst she self consicously pushes her straps back up on her costume.As much as I love this movie, I didn't love Don Murray.  It was his first film.  While he was sometimes funny, he often annoyed me, but maybe it was the way you were supposed to feel about his character.  She makes it perfectly clear to him that she isn't going to marry him, but he does everything in his power to get her.Marilyn's Cheree' and Ol' Verge, played by Arthur O'Connell, were the most likeable characters in the film.Eileen Heckart plays Cheree's friend.  There are some good character actors in this movie that help make it that much more entertaining.It's a charming movie that will capture your heart at it's sweet ending. Sure, it has it's truly corny and utterly sacchrine sweet dialogue, but it's got Marilyn!A MUST FOR THE TRUE MM FANS!!!For anyone who's never seen any of her movies, this is the one to watch, she is at her peak here.

352371,"BLACKMAIL, made as a silent film by Hichcock and ultimately dubbed, produced one giant step forward for movie fans. It is worth all of the price to see the hugely innovative camera work that Hitchcock used to roll out this 1929 movie. He took a simple story that really needed no more than a stage; connected the scenes with interesting movement and understandable transitions; then held your attention with camera work decades ahead of the time. The bonus of the movie is watching the actors ham it up--especially the nasty extortionist--using a mime-expression style of acting for its' 1920s time so that the audience always, without fail, recognized the villain seducer, always taciturn hero, guilty woman, tough detective, slimey blackmailer, etal. As an extra bonus, the story made certain that nobody nice was sent to jail. If the story had been filmed today, the blackmailer would have gone up in flames after falling from the British Airlines ferris wheel, but in 1929 Hitchcock did the next best thing and . . . well, I say,  you'll have to watch the movie to see the blackmailer's appropriate finish.

The sight of the abundant Mostel playing coy sex games with very aged women is enough in itself to give the average person a coronary from laughing too hard.But then...BUT THEN...Bialystock hires an accountant to review his books. Enter innocent, deeply disturbed Leo Bloom, played to the hilt by a young Gene Wilder, and the goings-on get almost too funny to stand. Wilder tends to have anxiety attacks (""I'm HYSTERICAL!

There are now only 8 humans left (only 6 are seen and it is not clear what happened to the other 2).  The rest of humanity was tricked into wiping itself out through a nuclear holocaust (the serious message of the film).  However, instead of performing his mission to wipe out the few remaining unarmed and much weaker humans, the Ro-Man spends most of his time either contacting the few remaining humans via a video screen to continuously announce to them that they are going to die, making excuses to his commander about why he is just standing around doing nothing, or walking up and down a hill. Meanwhile, the Ro-Man's communicator for some weird reason is always blowing bubbles all over the place (I kept expecting Lawrence Welk to show up).The whole film has a very surreal and trippy atmosphere to it, partly thanks to the bubble machine and the constant use of film negatives and the often emotionless acting.  For an all-ages film from that period, it is also surpisingly sadistic (you should see what happens to the two annoying kids!). There is a wedding scene that outdoes anything Ed Wood ever did, the Ro-Man falls in love with the young human female and becomes conflicted (he cannot understand his strange attraction), and there is footage of really bad animated dinosaurs and actual lizards fighting each other with fins pasted on their backs, all taken from other films, which are completely out of place.  And, oh yeah, there is a completely cheat ending that is repeated 3 or 4 times!This is must viewing.  It is just too bad it hasn't been released in 3D.",N/A
327053,"Now we know that the Hitchhiker's Guide will never get turned into a movie, this is the best visual memento we have of whatmight have been. Unfortunately the six-episode BBC series has many flaws, not least of which was the casting of Sandra Dickinson as Trillian.Adams' finest moment was the first BBC radio series, broadcast in 1978, and his life after that regrettably was a series of missed deadlines and lesser works which never achieved the same standard of inventiveness. Perhaps Adams recognised that fact himself in his later years, which was why he devoted much of his last months trying to persuade Disney to make that movie.One of the eclectic features of the first radio series, which was missing in both the second and this TV adaptation, was the choiceof original music extracts from the period. Gone are the nuggets from Patrick Moraz, Stomu Yamashta and Terry Riley, and intheir place we get filler music from Paddy Kingsland, Tim Souster and the radiophonic workshop. OK, so the BBC is spared theproblem of royalty payments, but their omission cuts a lot of atmosphere from the backing track.This double-DVD set is instructive in the extras it contains: an hour-long documentary of the making of the TV Hitchhikerrecorded in about 1993. It seemed impossible for any actor to fluff their lines without saying ""Oh f*?!"" -- that's what makes theDVD a '15' rating in the UK. The out-takes aren't particularly funny, and there's only one deleted scene. What we really wanted to hearabout was how the idea for the Hitchhiker came about, but that is essentially the stuff of the project that came before the TVseries, namely the radio programmes. Mention of them seems largely verboten in this package. We do get to see an early DouglasAdams sketch featuring Monty Python's Graham Chapman -- Douglas regularly supported Graham during the latter's alcoholic phases -- but the sketch isn't that funny.We also get to hear a sample of the laughter track recorded for the first episode -- it's generated by a group of science fiction fanssitting far too close to a microphone. The BBC wisely decided to broadcast without the canned laughter.The main problem with the extras is that there's not enough of Douglas, and too much of Alan Bell, the TV series producer who,many feel, wasn't quite the right choice to catch the atmosphere of Hitchhiker.Anyway, try it for yourself. I've no regrets about buying the DVD. I already had the series on VHS video (and audio CD, andaudio cassette, and book, and ...). Alongside 'Fawlty Towers' and 'Ripping Yarns', Hitchhiker was the best thing to emerge fromBritish comedy in the 1970s.The most telling aspect of the TV Hitchhiker is that very little of it is funny, after hearing the radio series. The radio Hitchhikeropened up endless possibilities. It was radio at its best, opening up our minds and imagination. Putting it down on video somehowseemed to confine everything. The jokes were nearly all the same as per the radio scripts, and yet they now rang hollow.",N/A
520653,"I was amazed when I left the theater after seeing ""The Fellowship of the Ring."" Peter Jackson and his crew have done the best job on the classic novel by J.R.R. Tolkien. The scenery, the characters, the geographical locations in New Zealand and everything in this movie was done with such precision and effort that I smiled every time I saw something that I loved in the book actually appear before my eyes. This is easily, in my own opinion, the best quality film that I have ever seen.Let me get something straight. ""The Lord of the Rings"" is my all time favorite novel and I was really hoping that Peter Jackson, his crew, and the characters wouldn't screw up on the first part of the best fantasy saga ever written. They didn't. From the first minutes of the film, I was drawn in to the world that I know and love so much. The geographical locations and the sets in New Zealand were breathtaking and were crafted and found oh so well.The characters that were casted for this movie were the absolute best. Every charcter that was presented in this film was just as I had imagined the charcter from the book. Frodo, Aragron, Gimli, Legolas, and everyone else that played a role in this film did a superb job.A lot of har work was put into the making of this film and every last drop of it was worth it. The action in this film is like the pages of the actual book just came to life; Peter Jackson really made this movie from the actual book unlike other movies that were originally books.With the Academy Awards coming up, I truly hope that this film takes home all of the gold. It really deserves it. ""The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring"" was probably the best movie I have ever seen in my life. I don't say that just because ""The Lord of the Rings"" is my all time favorite novel but because of the sheer perfection that came with this movie. I smiled seeing something from the book appear on screen. This is a movie that you'll watch again and again. All in all, totally recommended. I can't wait for this film to come out on DVD and for ""The Two Towers"" and ""The Return of the King"" to hit theaters in late 2002 and 2003. Watch this movie, I guarantee that you'll love it.",The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring
536185,"**1/2 Journey with us back into the dankest recesses of the human psyche in Ridley Scott&#8217;s &#8220;Hannibal,&#8221; the long awaited sequel to &#8220;The Silence of the Lambs,&#8221; one of the darkest films ever to be awarded a Best Picture nod by the Motion Picture Academy of Arts and Sciences.  In pop culture terms, Hannibal Lector has, of course, become the modern incarnation of implacable evil.  Not only do his cannibalistic acts represent the ultimate in human moral debasement and degradation, but his seeming indestructibility makes him all that much more horrifying.  His escape at the end of the first film served as a perfect setup for this sequel, as we find Lector living a life of seeming &#8220;normalcy&#8221; in Florence, Italy, just waiting for the proper moment to come out of &#8220;retirement.&#8221;  That moment arrives when Clarice Starling, the FBI agent who helped to save Hannibal&#8217;s last victim, is suddenly in the news again after an abortive and disastrous attempt to arrest a major criminal ends in the death of a number of her fellow officers.  Lector begins communicating with Clarice again, vowing to restart the game of intellectual cat-and-mouse he so enjoyed in the previous film.For most of its running time, &#8220;Hannibal&#8221; is a pretty enticing thriller.  Anthony Hopkins repeats the brilliant work he did in &#8220;Lambs,&#8221; making this most evil of movie villains both chillingly unreachable and bizarrely compelling.  With his clipped diction and often-incisive glimpses into the dark truths of the human psyche, he keeps the audience as emotionally off-balance as he does Clarice herself.  Indeed, we understand why she is both repelled and strangely attracted to this man.  Julianne Moore, who replaces Jody Foster in the role she originated ten years ago, brings an impressive reticence and hesitancy to this woman caught between her moral dictates and her desire to know more about the evil she is confronting.  In fact, apart from this explanation, many of her actions later in the film would be inexplicable unless we were to consider her utterly incompetent at her job.  My suspicion is that the filmmakers have something deeper in mind.  In addition, writers David Mamet and Steven Zaillan have created an interesting subplot involving Giancarlo Giannini as an Italian detective who uncovers Hannibal&#8217;s identity and thinks he can outsmart the devilish mastermind, capture him, turn him over to the authorities and make a fortune by collecting the reward money.  Giannini perfectly captures the subtle nuances that define this extraordinarily complex character, a man made up of many different, even conflicting moods and motives.So far, so good.  But then - inevitably perhaps with material of this nature - the filmmakers cannot resist going overboard into downright incredibility and gruesomeness as the film approaches its denouement.  Even those familiar beforehand with the tenor of this story may well be appalled by some of the turns the film takes in its latter stages.  In the past, one used to encounter scenes like these only in low budget exploitation films like &#8220;The Texas Chainsaw Massacre.&#8221;  Now they are being fed &#8211; pardon the pun &#8211; to mass audiences in the guise of slickly marketed &#8220;entertainment.&#8221;  Poor Ray Liotta &#8211; I will never be able to look at him from here on out without seeing him in the condition he ultimately ends up in at the close of this film.  It is an image too indelible to ever be completely forgotten and goes well beyond the pale even for a film on this nasty a subject area. Moreover, whereas the first film ended on a note of clever, albeit macabre black humor, &#8220;Hannibal&#8221; closes with a scene that is simply sickening in its unbridled grotesquerie.Of course, complaining about the level of gruesomeness in a film about a serial cannibal may smack one as a bit of a Pollyanish stance for a knowledgeable viewer to take.  Still, the first two-thirds of the film, in which the writers and director exercise an admirable amount of restraint, prove that this material can be even more effective when it is dealt with through indirection than when it is all laid out for us in such grisly, graphic detail.  There is much to recommend &#8220;Hannibal,&#8221; but unless you have a cast iron stomach and a very short memory span, you may well want to skip out before the final curtain is finally wrung down on the scene.  That is if you ever want to eat again.",N/A
699130,"There are some quantum holes in the central thesis of this film, murky subtext about faith and about grief. But the film is rescued by some great special effects--particularly the climactic scene--and by solid performances by Will Patton and Laura Linney who invariably brings everything she's got to any role she plays.Gere is somewhat leaden and is looking as if he's had his face tightened with the attendant expressionlessness that accompanies plastic surgery. Or else he just didn't feel it. Some good scenes keep the movie going, along with nice, tight editing. It's entertaining but fairly forgettable; certainly not the worst film I've ever seen. It just lacks coherence in terms of just what The Mothman Prophecies are intended to be. Suspend disbelief and this is worth watching.",N/A
525733,"The staggering success of J.K. Rowlings' Harry Potter novels put enormous pressures on the producers of the movie version of the first book in a the series, ""Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone"". This was the most eagerly anticipated movie based on a book since ""Gone With the Wind"" sixty-two years ago.I am happy to report that the movie turns out to be quite good. If it has a problem, it is that it is too slavishly faithful to the book. This prevents the movie from soaring to the great heights a visual medium can reach on its own terms and makes it run a bit too long. Two and one-half hours is a long time for most kids to sit still; however, there are enough sights and thrills here for most of them to tolerate its length happily.For those of you who don't know, Harry Potter [Daniel Radcliffe] is an orphan who lives in the cupboard under the stairs of his uncaring relatives' suburban home. One day he and his guardians are inundated by letters [delivered by owls!] which say that Harry has been accepted into Hogwarts School. This is how Harry finds out that he's a wizard. After much magical persuasion, Harry gets to go to Hogwarts. There, he meets wizards and witches, sorcerers and trolls, and other fantastic creatures. For the first time ever, Harry feels like he's at home. There are a lot of happy, magical moments at the school, but there are also dangerous ones. Among them are a dark wood that students are never to enter, an evil professor, some not-so-nice fellow students, and a demon that wants Harry dead. Harry and his new best friends, Ronald and Hemione [Rupert Grint and Emma Watson], are in for many fantastic adventures.The excellent cast includes some of Britain's best actors, including the legendary Maggie Smith as Minerva and Richard Harris as Demeledore.  Robbie Coltrane is remarkable as Hadrid, the loveable giant who is always doing and saying the wrong things, and so is Alan Rickman as the nasty Professor Snape. Radcliffe, Grint and Watson are gifted young actors and play their characters without the annoying cuteness that is found in many kids' movies.Some of the special effects are amazing, especially the flying Quiddich game sequences and one involving an encounter with a giant chess set that comes to life. Many of the effects don't look lifelike, but, considering the movie's big budget, this may have been done on purpose, in order to give the movie a fantasy, dream-like look.Some of the movie may be too intense for very young children. This has always been a problem with movies, though. When I was five or six, I was totally traumatized by the wicked queen and her poisoned apple in Disney's ""Snow White and the Seven Dwarves"". I don't like apples to this day. But, then, I was pretty high on the wimp scale.",N/A
38873,"Death. It's a touchy subject for everyone. But director James Wong doesn't take it lightly in his hot horror-thriller, Final Destination. In Final Destination, Devon Sawa plays Alex Browning who -- after having a vision -- saves himself and 6 others from an exploding plane. Turns out, ""Death"" wasn't through with them. One by one, they begin to die gruesome deaths. It's up to Alex to figure out Death's plan, and save those who are barely hanging on.Final Destination was a very big sigh of relief for the horror genre after the slur of masked maniacs that had recently hit the big screen. Jeffrey Riddick's (storywriter) interesting idea was turned into a very interesting and deep movie by screenplay writer Glen Morgan and director James Wong. A very good element in Final Destination is that its characters were well developed and you cared for them by time Death made his way into their path. And the actors and actresses that made these characters all did great jobs in making us believe them. Devon Sawa - one who I personally never liked -- perfects the scared and confused but brave Alex Browning. Ali Larter - who has always been a favorite -- plays the part of Chloe, and plays it well. The remaining cast - Kerr Smith, Sean William Scott, Kirsten Cloke, Chad Donella, and more -- all did well. There's also a worthy cameo from Tony Todd, the infamous CandyMan. Great casting for this movie!The New Line Platinum Series DVD is something to be proud about. There are two commentaries: one from James Wong, and another from Glen Morgan and the cast. With the deleted scene and alternate ending, it shows a different way the story could have went, but glad they didn't. Even though it is very interesting. Two featurettes are also present. One that explains the process of the test screenings that Final Destination went through, and another about a woman who claims to have premonitions much like the ones Sawa's character experiences in the movie. Rounding out the extras are two entertaining games, the theatrical trailer, and bios.Final Destination is one to keep at the top of your list, and so is the DVD release. Here's hoping that the already hyped sequel is just as good, if not better.",N/A
542337,"Having not seen the first episode, and being completely unhumored by the previews for either of the movies, I only watched this as it was on one of the movie channels.  I have to admit that I did laugh at a couple of parts.  It was a typical gross-out movie.  I feel that an excessive amount of time was spent with the butler's disfigured hand.  The ridiculousness of the characters' reactions to his hand was taken beyond being humorous to being irritating.  The Wayans brothers liberally use elements of other films and current events for, apparently, both parody and for lack of ability to create original material.  You will see gratuitous sampling from tons of movies (besides the Exorcist) including Mission Impossible 2; Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon; The Matrix; and Twister.  There is even a scene (albeit devoid of any humorous content) devoted to a parody of Nike commercials.  Because of the use of material from other films, if you are ever going to see this, I recommend watching it before it becomes severely outdated--as it will likely become much less interesting if none of these samplings from other movies are recognized.",Scary Movie 2

703452,"In The Bedroom is a film that may not be for everyone.  It is a drama that hinges on real emotions of real people.  Today, it seems people want explosions, films written with foul language as a basis of the text, and CGI effects.  This film is smarter than any of that.Nick Stahl (who is amazingly refreshing and believable), a young college student home for the summer, is dating Marisa Tomei, a ""divored"" older woman with two young sons.  Nick claims the relationhsip isn't serious, but both his parents (Tom Wilkinson and Sissy Spacek) know otherwise.  The girlfriend's ex-husband doesn't want to let her go and he does what he can to push she and the student apart.  I will not tell more of the plot as it could ruin the film for you.  However, I will say that the title refers not to a sexual relationship, as such, but rather an expression that... two males ""in the bedroom"" with one female leads to competition.  What that competition is and does is the subject of this film.Tom Wilkinson so easily slips into the skin of his character that you will believe that he is playing himself.  This is a real man and you know it.  Spacek goes beyond anything she's done since ""Coal Miner's Daughter"" and delivers a triumphant performance.In the Bedroom does have its faults though.  It's slow.  It's often quite slow.  I really felt like it could have used some more heavy handed editing.  And the editing itself is often disconcerting.  It seems to jump and to be choppy as if the editor were experimenting with a new tool while he did his job.On the whole the film is really amazing and well written.  As somone who is sick to death of the free flowing cursing and sex in the majority of Hollywood's films, this was refreshing.  It wasn't immune to cursing, but it was certainly not obtrusive.  Also, there was absolutley no nudity and yet the same ""feeling"" was delivered.  I commend the director, writer and cast for delivering a really marvelous film that tells a really great story and does it with elegance and reserve rather than heavy handed pandering to the desires of 13 year olds.",In the Bedroom
484656,"Mission to Mars offers excellent visuals and a good cast, but the CGI is too cartoonish and the story is weak as well.

All those scenes just slow the movie down. The movie's best scenes are when the astronauts are in their space suits trying to fix the ship; the cast works best in these scenes, especially Tim Robbins. ... it really isn't that bad, the movie may end kind of corny but still I wouldn't give it one star just for that.

678405,"This film examines the street racing subculture and provides ample thrills for the 25 and under set.  Based on the box office numbers this film threw up, every teenager in the U.S. must have seen it at least twice, since it doesn't have much appeal outside that demographic.The screenplay pretends to be a detective story about an undercover cop Brian O'Connor (Paul Walker) who infiltrates the street racing scene to try to find a group thieves that has been hijacking tractor trailers and stealing the cargo.  Make no mistake about it.  This is not a detective story.  This is a racing story replete with fast, NOS guzzling street machines, horsed up to burn rubber and detailed to attract babes.  Fasten your seatbelt for a screaming ride to testosterone city.The script panders shamelessly to post pubescent boys with hormone overload.  Universal wisely kept it PG-13 to maximize the film's target audience.  There is plenty of strutting, getting in people's faces, muscle flexing and a street fight about every fifteen minutes.  Everyone demands respect and if they don't get it there is either a brawl or a race.  Director Rob Cohen, who cut his directorial teeth on ""Miami Vice"", has an implicit understanding of what makes male movies work and he pulls out all the stops in this film.Unfortunately, Cohen gets so immersed in the street culture that he recklessly reinforces antisocial conduct as normative.  The film sends a consistent message that honor and loyalty to one's friends are more important than the obeying the law.  The police are portrayed as jerks and fools.  The only way to handle injustice is to take matters into your own hands.  You stick up for your friends even if they are criminals and you are a cop.  If another cop disrespects one of your undercover friends, you slug him.  While this might be an accurate reflection of the culture, I feel compelled to interject that the movie industry has a social responsibility to teach our youth good lessons rather than bolster countercultural behavior in the name of realism.Once you get past the script, the film gets extraordinarily high technical marks for the action photography and stunts.  The cars are first rate.  Most of the ones seen at the race wars were owned by actual street racers who brought their cars from everywhere to be in the film.  The film has so much adrenaline pumping action that by the time it is finished you need oxygen and a yoga session to settle yourself down.  I can't ever remember a film that had so many cars going airborne.  There is more molten, smoking rubber in this film than in a Perelli manufacturing plant.  The final stunt where the cars are racing to beat the train across the railroad crossing is an awesome, heart-stopping thrill ride.  It is easy to see why kids flocked to this film.The most notable member of the cast is Paul Walker (The Skulls, Pleasantville) who steps up to the lead for the first time.  In the featurette included with the DVD, Rob Cohen declares Walker a modern day Steve McQueen.  I'm afraid not.  McQueen, who saw his heyday in the 1950's and 60's, was a swaggering, audacious male lead brimming with machismo and frequently compared to Paul Newman (who was the star in ""Somebody Up There Likes Me"", the first film in which McQueen appeared).  Walker is a pussycat by comparison.  If Walker were to be compared to anyone of that generation it would be Troy Donohue, the good looking heart throb of the 1960's.  Donohue wasn't extremely dynamic, but the camera loved him, and so did the teenage girls.  Walker fits comfortably into that description.If there is one standout in the film it is Vin Diesel as Dominic.  Diesel carries every scene in which he appears with a pure and imposing power that is present whether he is scrapping or just standing there.  He is mostly tough, but in the scene where he tells Brian about his father, he shows that he can conjure up a vulnerable side.  He presents his character in a way that is both charismatic and complex, part villain and part hero.  No one else in this cast is anywhere near Diesel's league as an actor.Jordana Brewster shows some promise as Dominic's sister and Brian's love interest.  Rick Yune, whose performance I enjoyed in ""Snow Falling on Cedars"", is menacing and believable as the leader of the Asian gang.This film has a limited audience, but is well done for its target market.  I rated it a 7/10 on the strength of the action and stunts.  The story is about a 2/10, but the racing and chase scenes are as good as it gets.",N/A

This is the first of three films released by Fox Studios (Heidi & Dimples being the other two) and while I am happy it is on DVD the picture quality is a BIG disappointment. Maybe because it was made earlier than other Temple films (1934) the graininess really shows through. In this case, it isn't much better than VHS, and that is sad. Perhaps, the original film negative is in poor shape but Fox probably could have done better. So, while I am ecstatic that Shirley Temple (the greatest child film star EVER) is getting her due on DVD, I am disappointed that the quality of this release isn't better.

588515,"... and while others may say this movie is slow, i say that it is just right.  It's those bizarre silences in-between lines that allow you to crawl into the characters' heads and see the utter absurdity of what is playing out in the scene.. but that's only if you allow yourself to be absorbed by it.my favorite example of this occurs in a scene where Crane (billy bob thornton) is finishing up cutting a boy's hair, but he keeps staring at his head.. several seconds go by as we see what he is seeing.. and finally he turns to his brother-in-law and asks &quot;you ever think about hair?&quot;.  We are then treated to more silence and again we see what Crane is seeing.. the top of the boy's head.  After some seemingly serious introspection, he again speaks:  &quot;you know.. it's a part of us.&quot;  Another bizarre silence.. &quot;and it just keeps growing&quot;.While this scene says nothing about the film's central story, it is very representative of the character Ed Crane.. and it's moments like this that make the story as a whole work in the way that it does.This movie is beautifully filmed, and at times, a very tragic story.. but make no mistake, this is an excercise in surrealism, and as such, it is quite different from any movie i've ever seen.  But, that being said, there is some serious magic going on in this movie.

However, from a critical point of view, they really blew it.They tried to too hard to make it a self-parody.  For all you directors out there who are making horror films, let me give you some free advice: don't EVER make them satires!  They don't call them horror movies for nothing.  They are supposed to be scary, not funny.  Also, the acting was pretty poor.  When the crew members on their walkie-talkies found out that someone had been killed, they were more like ""oh well, that's life"" instead of being genuinly grief-stricken.  Also, some black dude in this movie amazingly retains his sarcasm, even when he has a spike in his ribs.  ""It's going to take more than that"", he says.  He then gets another spike and says, ""Yep!  That oughta do it!""As far as Harry Manfredini's score goes, it started out very well in the beginning credits, but it went downhill from there.  In parts where the music should burst to life, it doesn't.  It also sounds more like a video game soundtrack.

I am just saying, whatever those pesky critics say this time, I can't really blame them.  But from my P.O.V., it was pretty good.  Some of the satire parts were not even that bad, especially when Jason goes to virtual reality Crystal Lake.  I laughed myself silly, even though they made Jason looked like a clown.

In the meantime, there are so many flashbacks with the past characters played by different actors that it becomes hard to figure out who from the present is who in the past. Newcomer JJ Field has nice screen presence as Michael Caine's younger Jack. Kelly Reilly as the beautiful young Amy doesn't much resemble Helen Mirren other than hair color, but brought life and energy to the role. I appreciated the issues of having a mentally disabled daughter and how each parent dealt with it. Laura Morelli played June, now an adult, lost in her own world, emotionally disconnected and isolated. Bob Hoskins does a nice job of carrying a torch for Amy. His younger self is well played by Anatol Yusef who sets the brothel workers abuzz with the size of his endowments. David Hemmings, 40 years after ""Blow Up"" looks quite different with eyebrows wildly careening across his brow, looking like escapees from Hogwarts.As with one other reviewer, my wife who rented the flick walked out on it. Although it's not easy at first, it is rewarding to finally connect the dots on the picture, making a satisfying evening's entertainment. Enjoy!",N/A

However, the graphic depiction of necrophilia bothered me. I know that in was put in mostly for shock value, but there is enough debauchery in De Sade's work, that I feel this fictionalized account of his life didn't need the scene. I have the DVD and will keep it, because the cast is good, the story is good, and the movie is worth seeing if you can get past the caveat above.",Quills

I really enjoyed the movie because of the stupid college-boy dialogue which really helped show that car movies aren't entertaining past car scenes. The car scenes were great, of course we all love seeing suped-up rice rockets and Supras, all being driven by macho testosterone-pumped pigs.Vin Diesel plays a bonehead who knows how to drive stick like a man, and Paul Walker plays a pansy who can't.

679715,"This has been one of my favorite DBZ stories since I first watched it over a decade ago.  The flow of the battles, timing, artistic composition, and scene direction are all fantastically done.  To watch this in the original Japanese is truly 45 minutes well spent, even if you can't understand a word of it.  I should know.  I've done just that more times than I can count.However, to watch the Funimation English dub of this film is like watching someone set fire to the Mona Lisa.  All of the dramatic silences, perfectly timed music, and short, to the point dialogues are scrapped in favor of constant babbling by nails-on-the-chalkboard irritating American voice actors and totally inappropriate pop music.  At times it seems that the English script is being made up as they go along!Luckily for us, you may watch this DVD in the original Japanese with directly translated subtitles to match.  It is only by this saving grace that I rate it a 5 star DVD.  However, if you'd like to conduct a small study in abysmal US translation, try watching it in English with the Japanese version subtitles on-screen.  You'll hear Cooler say, ""I wanna just blow this planet up, and I will"", but see on-screen that he actually said, ""It would be easy to destroy this planet, but my pride will not allow it.""  You'll read that Karin scolds Gohan for not climbing up from the bottom of his tower, but hear Gohan appologize for not bringing a gift!  And possibly worst of all, you'll hear characters spout endless, nonsensical trash-talk about how much pain they're going to inflict, while in the original Japanese they just stood calmly, staring each other down with confidence.It's amazing how arrogant we Americans can be.  Does Funimation actually think they are IMPROVING on the original by lazily throwing in bad pop music and idiotic jokes, and changing key story elements for no reason?  Please, Funimation.  In the future, stick to the script.  Distribution rights DO NOT make you Akira Toriyama.",N/A

The script is completely banal, a rehash of movies I'm sure I've seen before.  Jet Li's talents are wasted, as instead of doing actual fight sequences, he has to fight against himself (meaning lots of fights with computer inserted images, or other stunt men who get their face replaced), and it robs from the intensity of the fights.

676481,"I know I'm going to get hate mail for this review. &quot;Moulin Rouge&quot; is just one of those movies. Everybody just adores it, and you're stuck there thinking &quot;what?&quot; Sure, I could see where everybody's coming from. Love story, good production values, pop songs, and all that jazz. But &quot;Moulin Rouge&quot; is a movie that is as easy to despise as it is to love.The premise is simple. Take a whole bunch of pop music, plop it in the middle of a turn-of-the-century atmosphere and stick in a love story. Some would say such simple words wouldn't be enough to describe this film, but really, that's all it is. &quot;Moulin Rouge&quot; seems more like a reason for a soundtrack than a film.Ewan McGregor is Christian, an aspiring poet traveling to France for inspiration. Little does he know, inspiration will without a doubt come his way soon, in the form of Satine (Nicole Kidman), a popular courtesan working in the Moulin Rouge. He instantly falls in love, but of course, he can't live happily ever after with her (&quot;The only way of lovin' me, baby, is to pay a lovely fee!&quot;) And Satine has other plans for her future than spending it with Christian, and as her dreams to become an actress start to turn into reality, the greedy Duke of Monroth tries to bind her exclusively to him. So, take this, throw in &quot;Smells Like Teen Spirit&quot;, &quot;Like A Virgin&quot; and more, and what do you get? A ludicrous fiasco that's not even fun enough to be a sequel to &quot;Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band&quot; (yes, that IS a movie...)For a while in the beginning, the film is a joy to watch. But this lasts only a few minutes, for as the story starts to develop, the film stops having fun with itself and begins to set up a serious, dramatic mood. That would work if this was any other movie. But in &quot;Moulin Rouge&quot;, the utter ridiculousness of the placement of pop songs undermines anything notable. In the first scenes, I smiled when Christian randomly blurts out &quot;The Sound of Music&quot; and &quot;All You Need is Love&quot;. Very quickly, however, I was getting tired of all the oo-la-la. By the time Zidler (Jim Broadbent) is singing &quot;Like A Virgin&quot;, I was laughing at them, not with them. And don't even mention the ill-timed musical number set to &quot;Roxanne&quot;.I have to admit though, Ewan McGregor and Nicole Kidman certainly do have the pipes to carry out the job. They sing with passion (the same can't be said about a certain Mariah Carey) and truly bring out some spirit in the middle of all the chaos. It's too bad the film is such a pain, because they give performances worthy of recognition. The rest of the cast seems like they're having a good time, which does make the film slide along a little easier.&quot;Moulin Rouge&quot; starts with an idea that something could be done with. However, director Baz Luhrmann sells-out completely, completely giving his movie up for commercial success. There is really little inspiration after the first shots, and the premise might be able to sustain for two hours if the way it was carried out wasn't so gag-inducing. Quick note to Mr. Luhrmann: it's a very bad sign when you're is laughing so hard during dramatic moments that at the end, your friend turns to you and suggests you leave &quot;before the people in the back start shooting&quot;.",N/A
269028,"I'm actually going to start with the story itself first.  Who fans know it, and I think there's generally some great affection for this.  However if you're NOT a Who fan I'm not sure, despite what many speculate, that this is a good introduction.  There is a LOT of Doctor Who history which you're assumed to know to understand how the same character is being played by 5 different actors in the same place at the same time (or nowhere in time technically).  It is also not representative of the normal stories because of the need for getting all the major characters on the screen.  Additionally while the three most classic villains of Doctor Who (The Master, the Daleks, and the Cybermen) are in this (and us Who fans like to see them) they are hardly menacing as when involved in their own plots to gain intergalactic domination.  For novices this story was made to celebrate Doctor Who and in many ways succeeds for fans, but I think is not a good introduction for people new to the series, unless of course you have a fan to talk you through it.For fans though there are some great things.  First of all we get to see the different regenerations of the Doctors interract with each other.  This is ALWAYS hilarious.  While each Doctor had their own manner and sense of humour in dealing with their companions, it's absolutely hilarious to see how much they dislike their other selves.As noted above the top Who villains make cameos, but not at all satisfying ones.  Teh Cybermen and the lone Dalek just aren't threatening without their own specific plans for world domination.  The Master is a bit better and has his moments but even he is rather tame in this episode.Naturally we also get to witness pathetic assistants (usually female as is the case in Doctor Who), some witty yet cheesy one liners,and some cheesy special effects.  However for people not familiar with Doctor Who, these are actually all part of the appeal.  Much like older Bond films there are things that might make one wince in real life that are priceless to see on the screen.Personally as they're only 2 other stories with multiple Doctors this is a rare treat.  The banter is at times priceless, but for me there was something else that made this a fantastic DVD.The commentary by Peter Davison (the 5th Doctor) and Terrance Dicks is wonderful.  To have the man who largely wrote the story and one of the principal actors discussing script choices, rapid edits, shooting conditions, and of course BBC budget limitations (notorious, and often explanatory for the cheesiness found in Doctor Who as well as Blake's 7 and other British science fiction).  From experience some commentary tracks are dull or of questionable value (Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon imho) but this is one of the BEST ever!  Davison and Dicks don't just tease others but take themselves to tasks for things that they wished they could have done better.  Marvelous!I whole-heartedly recommend this DVD, but be aware that it is not a truly first class Doctor Who story, but a Doctor Who EVENT.  For newbies I really urge you to look elsewhere.  Watch a classic episode or two, but if you get this as your introduction you may be confused and nonplussed by the villains to go much futher.  It would be a shame...",Doctor Who - The Five Doctors VHS

506529,"This film, the original version of Tom Cruise's Vanilla Sky, is a stylish, ambitious thriller that may not quite achieve the profundity it's aiming for but nonetheless plays fascinating tricks with reality and imagination, dreams and waking, and the degree to which we can trust what we perceive, even about ourselves.  Cesar (Eduardo Noriega) is a handsome but dissipated rich boy, notorious for never spending two nights with the same woman.  But on the evening of a party in his apartment he discovers that his latest conquest, Nuria, has no intention of being discarded like all the rest.That night he falls in love, or in lust at any rate, with his best friend's date, Sofia (Pen&eacute;lope Cruz) and when the friend gets drunk, Cesar takes Sofia home and spends the night, though just talking.  Next morning, as he's leaving, he finds Nuria waiting for him and is taunted into accepting a ride home.  On the way she swerves off the road, a murder/suicide attempt that kills her and leaves Cesar horribly disfigured.  Much of the remainder of the story is told in flashbacks, with Cesar in the psychiatric ward of a prison--wearing a mask that looks somewhat like his original face, but inhuman and immobile--trying to piece together what has happened since, including the events that have ended with him being held for the murder of Sofia, with whom he eventually became lovers, though obviously ill-fated.As Cesar and an immensely patient psychiatrist delve back into the past, various elements like  cryogenics, reconstructive surgery, a charismatic TV personality, the mysterious reappearance of Nuria, and a possible scheme by a group of investors with whom Cesar shares business interests all enter into the tangled plot.  Some of this is confusing and the behavior of several characters, especially Sofia, is unbelievable as its happening, but by the end these inconsistencies have been cleared up, if not the entirety of the plot, which is left fairly open-ended.Though the tale is quite convoluted it's never needlessly so.  The whole is done with great vigor and a sure-handedness that carries the film through its most dubious moments.  The only real problem is structural : Cesar is such a flaming ... that the viewer quite enjoys seeing him get his comeuppance, rather than feeling much empathy.  This makes for a somewhat sadistic, but still enjoyable, experience as he's taught some brutal lessons about the limits of wealth and physical beauty.  One might prefer an ending that made a more definitive statement about what's come before, but the intentional ambiguity allows for personal conjecture.  That may be a bit maddening but its not necessarily a bad thing.GRADE : B+",Open Your Eyes VHS
357263,"'Tombstone' is one of my favorite movies for a variety of reasons.First, despite the growing trend to rewrite history showing that the good guys were really the bad guys, this movie clearly shows that the Earps were the good guys and the Clantons were the bad guys.  Don't pay any attention to the revisionists who say otherwise.Second, it's a great action-filled movie.Third, Kurt Russell as Wyatt Earp plays the part in a way that makes you think he IS Wyatt Earp.  From the photographs I've seen of Wyatt, you'd have to say the Russell is a mirror image of the immortal and legendary Earp.  The lean, hard 6 foot body, the sweeping handlebar mustache, the blue eyes, the cold look... Russell was magnificent as Mr. Earp.Fourth, Val Kilmer played a fantastic role as Doc Holliday (who may have been my illegitimate great-grandfather; we'll never really know).  Kilmer's body size is too large to mistake him physically for Doc, but his portrayal negates that problem.  What a wonderful interpretation of Doc he gave.  The meanest dude in town.... he was the ultimate ""You don't mess with Doc Holliday"" character.  Incidently, I thought that Quaid in ""Wyatt Earp"" was a better physical representation of Doc than Val Kilmer.Fifth, Powers Booth was a great Curly Bill.  From pictures of the real Curly, you'd think that Booth and he were twins.  He was wonderful in the part.  Wyatt really killed Curly Bill in a gunfight that was reasonably well depicted in the movie.Sixth, the setting and the location shots seemed to be right on target... southeastern Arizona.  Nice to see that authenticity.From the history endpoint, much was so accurate.  County Sherrif Behan was in cahoots with the rustlers (My own reading and study have led me to believe that he was not only a supporter of them, but in fact, their leader).  Despicable Ike Clanton was a crude and totally distasteful individual, though not as ignorant as he was played in the movie.  Texas Jack Vermillion and Turkey Creek Jack Johnson were real people, and friends of Wyatt.  Although Michael Biehn played well as Johnny Ringo, and brooded much as Ringo did, he was too dirty looking to fit the image I have of Ringo.  When Doc Holliday died in the sanitarium in Colorado, he was visited by a priest as shown in the movie (where he really converted to the Catholic faith because of his long past love of someone who was Catholic), and he supposedly really said ""This is funny"" just before he died.  Wyatt really married Josie and spent the rest of his life traveling the West with her at his side.  Jason Priestly's portrayal of Billy Breckenridge as a homosexual was accurate.Ok, now for some ""complaints""...  mostly with historical facts.  I didn't like Bill Paxton's protrayal of Morgan Earp... his character was much too geeky to have been the real Morgan.  Also, Morgan and Doc were quite close, but the movie didn't get into that.  The one glaring historical fact which no one disputes was incorrect was the shootings of Morgan and Virgil.  The movie had Morgan killed and Virgil shot on the same night.  This, in fact, is far from factual.... Virgil was shot just after Christmas in 1881, while Morgan was murderd in March of 1882 (in a pool hall as shown in the flick).  There was great tension in Tombstone between the dates of the two shootings which was not evident in the movie.  Few people realize that in Tombstone prior to the time of all this trouble, Bat Masterson and Luke Short were in town and were allied with Wyatt; they had their reasons for departing before the OK Corral.  Another place where the movie wasn't as accurate as it could have been was the relationship between Wyatt and John Clum, the editor of the Epitaph.  They were actually quite close and Clum supported Earp totally.The movie had Doc killing Ringo in a shootout.  It's true that Ringo was killed in June of 1882, but there isn't hard evidence who cut him down.  It's possible it was Doc, who absolutely HATED Ringo, especially for his part in Morgan's murder.  Ringo was killed after Wyatt and Doc left Arizona to go to Colorado, because of a warrant against them.  It's possible they came back to finish Ringo, who most certainly had a hand in murdering Morgan.  According to Mrs. Earp, it was Wyatt who really terminated Ringo.  There is so much debate about his death.  The ""official"" coroner's report says suicide, but too many details refute this.  My opinion is that Earp went back into Arizona and took care of Ringo.My primary objection to the historical authenticity revolves around WHY the battle took place.  The full reasons never came out in the movie, or in any other movie about Wyatt Earp.... Wyatt's dealings with Behan in the agreement they made which Behan reniged on, the Benson stage incident, the shootings at Skeleton Canyon, Ike Clanton's deal with Wyatt to turn over his friends who had killed Bud Philpot during the Benson stage robbery for the purpose of the reward money, the resentment the Clanton Gang had for the way that Earp throttled their evil empire, etc.  The movie made it seem that these people were just angry with each other... they were, but there was so much that led up to the fight that wasn't shown in any of the movies.I would like to have seen much more of the trial of the Earps, in which they were correctly acquitted, rather than just Judge Welles Spicer's final ruling.  You might be interested in reading the transcript of the trial and read the words of Wyatt, Ike Clanton and so many others, which will convince you that the verdict was correct.  (See ""The OK Corral Inquest"" by Alford E. Turner, from Creative Publishing Company, College Station, TX)Despite all the historical omissions, and they did take away from the movie for me, I'd still have to say this was a GREAT movie.  I watch it over and over again, and will continue to do so.  Even if you're not into the history of the period, you'll enjoy a great action movie, excellent music, and some terrific acting.",N/A
663497,"Time and tide may wait for no man, but Tsui Hark's film certainly doesn't, jettisoning coherence and character in its Leone-lunge to the finish.  'Time and Tide' follows the wearisomely familiar 'North By Northwest' action formula - a cocky, irresponsible and selfish man emotionally matures and learns to think about others, to the point of risking his life.  Just in case we miss the point, there are TWO pregnant women in the film - his struggles to develop feelings, mirror the 'difficulties' in giving birth; the babies are a signal of rebirth for men who are willing to ditch their old (macho) lives and start again.The hero is a 21-year-old barman who picks up a hostile undercover cop, whose girlfriend has just ditched her.  After a drunken one-night-stand, he joins a dodgy security firm to raise enough money to escape to South America to 'forget' her, or, later, when he discovers she's pregnant, for alimony.  Meanwhile, in South America (and I found this part especially difficult to follow), a drug deal and jailbreak have consequences which spill out into Hong Kong.  At a job protecting some industrial magnate, the bodyguards learn that an assassination will be attempted.  The magnate's outcast, pregnant daughter, who married beneath her, is there with her husband, an abbattoir employee who unexpectedly connects the two plots.Hark's best films ('Peking Opera Blues', 'Once Upon A Time In China') are such fun because the action pyrotechnics are rooted in characters we come to care about.  In this film, however, action takes precedence, and characters are left to fend for themselves, which they find more difficult than dodging endless bullets.  Even this wouldn't matter if the action was up to Hark's usual spectacular standard.  But rather than dance, the set-pieces stutter, the irritatingly 'frenetic' camerawork and jittery editing destroy all momentum.  The confusion as to what is going on in any given set-piece leaves the viewer disengaged.  The 'choreography' of movement is disappointingly graceless, under-imagined, even perfunctory. The locations, so evocative and central to Hark's major works, are merely functional backdrops.  The whole thing goes on far too long, and the sentimental subplot attempting to re-orient the lesbian is tasteless.",N/A
315658,"I saw this movie on the library shelf and so checked it out. I did so because at the moment I am studying the life of Fredric March, and this was one of the plays he performed in his theatre career. I wanted to know what the play was about. He had played the role of the father in the stage version.Anyway...this is a LONG film and I had to watch it in two evenings. It seemed depressing to me from the very beginning, and seemed to slide you farther and farther down into the hopelessness of their lives as the film went on. I am not a fan of films that are so dark, so sad, so hopeless...it is no joy to watch a dysfunctional family such as this. They are a strange bunch...at times seeming to care for each other and saying a kind or loving word to each other, but in the next breath they are saying very hurtful words that cut to the heart. I could not believe how this pattern of &quot;I love you I hate you&quot; dialog went on and on in the movie. Obviously they are all deeply troubled people, and unable to really help each other. I did not care for the swearing in the movie, or all the times the name of God was used in vain. I must say I did not really LIKE this film at all...it was too hopeless, and for it to end them no better off than they were in the beginning, well you just sit there and wonder, &quot;What was the purpose of telling us this story?&quot; You cannot feel anything but sadness at their hopelessness, you are wanting to do nothing but to cry for this family.While I did not like the story, I will say the actors did a good job of portraying their characters...Katherine Hepburn stood out to me most of all; she seemed the most tragic figure in the family. This film was definately very real...there are people who do function like this in their relations to one another.

386901,"The basic story is that we need to heat up the cold war.  This will take the focus off of the president for the slouching economy.  The Russians are unwilling to play the game, so we must find a new adversary.  Canada wins the choice.Comedy is like smiling.  You take a situation that you cannot do anything about, or an attitude that you cannot do anything about, and just laugh at it.  This movie is the essence of what many people think they know about Canada.  It also contains what many people snicker about, politics.  So let's take it to the extreme add John Candy, Rhea Perlman a few eh's, a too clean to be true environment; you have ""Canadian bacon"".What makes this comedy is not the story but the one-liners and the parody on Canadian life.  One of everybody's favorite, is when a truck is stopped because it has obscenities written on the side of it.  The authority, OPP Officer (Dan Aykroyd, born in Ottawa, Ontario, Canada) points out that the obscenity is written only in English and must also be written in French.Who's Harry Crumb? ~ John Candy",Canadian Bacon VHS
603233,"Don't believe all the hype.  ""8 Mile"" isn't an excellent movie.  It's good, don't get me wrong.  But it could've been better.  Controversial white rapper Eminem plays Jimmy (or ""Rabbit"" as hes called in the film) who lives in a Trailer Park with his daughter Lily and his Mom (Kim Bessenger). in Detroit.  He spends most of his time working at a car plant, very appropriate for Detroit of course.  But as we find out, that's only to make a living.  He just so happens to have mad rap skills.  His three friends keep the movie funny.  His best friend of the group it seems is David (or ""Future"") played by Mekhi Phifer (""Save The Last Dance"") who does an excellent job.  Rabbit attempts several times to try and rap in front of a crowd where he would be noticed for record deals, but ends up freezing on stage everytime because of the crowd's booing.  Eventually the plot thickens and a relationshjp with is Mom and Daughter grow. Rabbit also ends up meeting a girl with a similar background aspiring to become a model, played by newcomer actress Brittany Murphy.  This movie seemed at times to be ""Choppy"" in some parts, and the other non-famous actors didn't seem to do that well.  Oscar-nominated actress Kim Bessenger (""Bless The Child"", ""I Dreamed of Africa"") did a great job as Jimmy's mother.  The swearing in the movie was rather harsh and wouldn't be reccomended for anyone under 15.  Because this movie is semi-autobiographical (similar to Mariah's ""Glitter"" in that case), we get a glimpse into what was once Eminem's life.  After seeing this movie I also had a lot more respect for rappers who get popular by the streets as well as people who live in Trailer Parks.  I would reccomend this movie if you are a fan of Eminem, or just want a fun Hip-Hop movie.",8 Mile
56290,"The 1949 ""Gatsby"" is a long buried classic that deserves the commercial video light of day. Produced by Paramount, it has been buried since it's release. The above reference to a Universal Home Video release is inaccurate, as Universal claims to not own the production rights. This film is haunting, and probably Ladd's finest dramatic performance. Macdonald Carey as Nick Carraway, is the moral conscience in a decadent time of any thing goes, as long as you win. NB: I recently encountered a commercial version of this film. It was released in 1980 by ""Hollywood Home Theater,"" in a plastic clamshell case. The quality is very good - the best I've seen for this film. The problem is that this version is very rare and hard to find.",N/A
299510,"Blake Edwards does a fine job of  directing his own original script for his gender, but not comically challenged film.We open with advertising executive Steve Brooks (Perry King), a cad in every sense of the word.  We are clear that Steve has broken many hearts, three of which turn on him at once.  As three of his scorned women decide to lure him into a hotub where he thinks the women have invited him for a multiple seduction, they get their revenge and drown him instead.Now Steve is dead, but hasn't quite reached heaven yet.  I suppose you could say he's in purgatory, until, as god requires, he can get one female to truly love him.  That would be a cinch for the unrepentant romeo except for the fact that at the last minute, the devil intervenes and decides he must get a female to truly love him AS another female, enter a great comic performance from Ellen Barkin.Ellen Barkin playing a female version of Perry King's Steve was great casting, since the two DO look so similar.  Barkin is truly comical as Amanda.  She tells Ad boss Tony Dow, that she's Steve's sister, again, believable.  What's not believable?  A high powered Ad agency letting a top executives sister, fill his now high-heeled shoes.  Hey, no one said this film was realistic.  However, the stepping in and filling anothers shoes becomes forefront, as Amanda takes over for Steve.  She also has to get used to being a woman.  This is not an easy task.  She desperately confesses to one of her murdering ex-lovers who she really is.  The ex then comes to Amanda's aid, teaching her how to do all the things girls do.  Barkin is worthy of Lucille Ball slapstick status as she hilariously teeters around on those hard to fill high-heel shoes, tripping and grasping walls.  She must also remember that since she is a woman physically,  mentally she must think and feel as one too, and can no longer covet fellow women.  All that to keep in mind,  while dealing with lascivious glances and advances from men as well.  In particular she has to fight off boss Tony Dow, and figure out the relationship with her buddy from work played by Jimmy Smits.  Amanda also tells Smits she's really Steve, and he will be the one person that can get her to heaven and out of this jam, but I can't tell you how, you'll have to watch and see!The most confusing part for Amanda will be how she is to deal with a sought after client (Lorraine Bracco) who is a lesbian, and wants a relationship with her.  She could wrap up the deal if she submits to Bracco's advances, but doesn't feel comfortable as a man inside a womans body, making love with a woman who doesn't like men.  Confusing?  Not at all.  I can guarantee you'll be amused at every scene.While ""Switch"" was not a tremendous commercial success for Blake Edwards like ""10"", amongst many others in his career, and treads in a similar water with his ""Victor/Victoria"", it is a highly watchable, humorous and delighfully happy film that you should not miss.  If you are a fan of actress Ellen Barkin, she really shines here in a fine comical AND sympathetic performance.  I mention sympathetic because, when the script and direction are done right, you WILL care about the characters.  When Steve is sent back to earth as Amanda and tries her hardest to find a female to truly love her,  you as the viewer, female OR male, will fall in love too,  with her AND this unique comedy film.",N/A

258502,"Shirley Valentine is a housewife. That's it. Just a housewife. She cooks, she cleans, she shops, mostly she talks to herself, and in this poignant film, she talks to us as well, the viewer. It's hard to get used to at first. A film with a woman all alone in a dreary apartment talking to herself, but you soon get past that one little oddity, and Shirley Valentine becomes real. Her life is so similar to millions of other 'just housewives' that if she didn't finally decide to go on a trip to Greece with a friend, there would have been no movie. Shirley loses her housewife persona in Greece, and after much inner turmoil and emotional self-battering, comes of age again within herself. It's a very beautiful and moving story, one most middle aged women can relate to quite well. I rooted Shirley on through out the movie. More than anything I wanted her to find herself, because the film is so good you believe, if only for a short time, that it is you going through this with Shirley. Shirley is no hero, she is no female icon and does not become anyone's object of worship, she just becomes herself, which turns out to be the best thing that could have happened to this movie.",N/A
581096,"This is a great coming of age story that I have watched twice in one week since I decided to buy it on a whim.  The story of Lydia and Sam and their exile to Wyoming, their unconventional relationship as mother and son is unforgettable.  Lydia isn't a woman who is very good at being a mother considering she drinks quite heavily and goes home with men at the bar.  When Sam meets a girl named Maurey, they both decide to start trying to figure out what sex is like.  Lydia tells them how to have sex and from that point on, this movie is a strange, oddball journey.  This film shows what can happen to kids who grow up too fast, but it does this in a way that is heart-warming and different than most films.I especially liked Michael Greyeyes' character, Hank Elkrunner.  He plays a good guy who falls for Lydia only to have to deal with her wild ways.  All of the actors in this film did a great job.  And surprisingly, this film has a happy ending.All in all, a great, funny film that is sure to stay with you long after its over.  Hilarious",Skipped Parts

That man is Stuart (Liev Schrieber), ex-boyfriend to Kate (Meg Ryan).  When Stuart is involved in an accident, Leopold is left to fend for himself.Kate is unbelieving of Stuart's story and sends Leopold out into the city, leading to all of the expected fish-out-of-water adventures.  This first portion of the movie is completely unorginal and provides little humor.  Eventually, the 19th century charm is unleashed, and Leopold and Kate find themselves falling in love (as always happens when Meg Ryan is around, it seems).  Kate is trying to climb the corporate ladder, yet Leopold leads her to quesion her motives and her desires.While the romantic portion is predictable, it is also reasonably enjoyable.  And since the audience is probably familiar with the typical Meg Ryan movie formula, the lack of originality is forgivable.  It is neither a terrific movie nor a horrible one.",Kate & Leopold
230051,"In the beginning was science fiction of Jules Verne and Herbert Wells (of the time machine fame). They mostly explored the possibilities of the future through the lense of the scientific achievement. Then came the thirties with their pulp fiction printed in cheap magazines and the romance of war and love against the backdrop of outer space that we now regard as Space Opera. Thanks to that heritage of ours, almost everything that Hollywood would serve up Sci-Fi on the screen these days, from Star Wars to Buck Rogers, would be miore appropriately called space opera. There are exceptions, of course; we have Space Odyssey and the Fantastic Voyage (which almost escapes the clutches of the cold war in favor of pure scientific pursuit were it not for Donald Pleasance attempting to sabotage the effort!), and then there is the Sark Star.While it was inspired in part by Dr. Strangelove, and has the campy feel of a low budget film, the picture is a John Carpenter original showing off his quirky humor. From the beginning we don't know if our militarized space cadets are adrift in space or in the sea of a mammouth bureaucracy. Yes, there is a talking smart bomb that experiences some deep philosophical issues, but who can blame it when thed computer that controls it has its wires crossed? The spacemen are there to make the universe safe for settlement by destroying the unstable planet, and they succumb in the end due to a breakdown in communications, which is at the heart of most major disasters.For a change the film feels like classic science fiction, we have men in space, as opposed men on a battleship fighting a battle, that happens to be in space. Most of the themes present in classical sci-fi are addressed in this film - Man vs Outer Space, Man dealing with effects of extended space travel, Man vs Machine, and even the etiquette of dealing with the alien life forms is addressed in this neat little sci-fi farce that no self-respecting fan of sci fi ought to miss.",N/A

277998,"The story of Italian priests hiding Jews in the Chapel of St. Francis and Cloister of St. Clare should have been given better treatment than this poorly done film.Slashed by almost an hour from its original release, Cross plays a young priest asked by Bishop James Mason to hide some Jews in the monastery and cloister at Assisi. He does, while making friends with thoughtful Nazi Maximilian Schell, as the town commandant. Jews are almost discovered, the war ends, everyone gets a little mention about what happened to them at the end of the film.The film's pace here is dull. The film is nothing more than Nazi extras asking for identification papers and Cross looking like the cat that ate the canary. I half expected him to wink at the camera everytime a Nazi goose stepped into frame. Cross also often forgets his Italian accent. Mason's idea of an Italian accent is to add an ""uh"" syllable at the end of every word, such as ""We-uh must-uh help-uh the-uh Jews-uh."" Most of his speeches are completely devoid of understanding, I thought I was listening to pig latin.The Jews here are not shown as victims so much as that they have been inconvenienced by World War II. They do not come across as stoic and bold, but spoiled and complaining. In one embarassing scene, Cross, loved by all Jews who meet him, does a magic trick, compliments a painting, and comforts Jews like he is the activities director at an adult day care facility.Maximilian Schell comes off best as the Nazi officer torn between his obligation to the Third Reich and his upbringing as a Catholic. Not enough of his inner turmoil was explored.The film also features a horrendous soundtrack that sounds like bits and pieces of other war films just thrown into the sound mix. There are a couple of battle scenes, one with obvious stock footage, but this is not good.""The Assisi Underground"" was made by the guys at the old Cannon Group studio, and that was the first mistake if you are familiar with their product. I cannot recommend this film.This is rated (PG) for gun violence and mild profanity.",The Assisi Underground VHS
515525,"Britney Spears is the fastest-selling female artist of all-time, shifting 60 million albums in the space of just over 3 years! She's the biggest female pop phenomenon since Madonna and this video defines why she is just that. This is the first home video from Britney and was released in November/December 1999 and is one of the most successful music videos in years! The video features music videos, exclusive interviews and backstage information that you won't find anywhere else...The video begins with Growing Up. This first section focuses on Britney's life as a child. She talks exclusively about her childhood, how she got started on the road to stardom and gives us a peek inside her own family photo album. This first section is really mellow and sweet with lots of great footage of Britney as a young kid in various places such as dance rehersals and auditions. The second section in the video is Recording My First Album. After Britney graduated from school, she flew to Sweden to record her amazing first album, Baby One More Time after she secured a record deal with Jive Records. Britney also gives her own personal guide to a few tracks, such as Sometimes and Baby One More Time. This part of the video is good, but I think they could've spent more time on it - like letting Britney give her personal opinion on every song, not just a few. The next section in Making Music Videos. We get to see Britney behind-the-scenes filming her first three music videos for Baby One More Time, Sometimes and (You Drive Me) Crazy. The video for Baby One More Time is absolutely superb - I'm SURE you've seen it before. The idea of Britney dressed as a schoolgirl was genius, as it appealed to young girls, middle-aged men and practically every teenage boy on Earth! Britney knows how to promote herself - after all, sex sells. The second video is Sometimes. This video is set on the beach and is a perfect summer video for the summer of 1999! The third and final video on Time Out With Britney is (You Drive Me) Crazy. This video caused outrage amongst American Family groups who accused Britney of provoking young girls into dressing sexily, years before they were ""suppose to"". Along with a good mind for business, Britney Spears also knows how to cause controversy - just like Madonna. The video obviously worked - I was transfixed to the TV set for three and a half minutes every time the video came on. Face it, she looks hot in this video! The next section in Time Out With Britney is called On The Road. You get to follow Britney on tour and get an exclusive backstage access. This section is short but sweet, and probably the worst section of the video. The final section in this great music video is Disney Channel In Concert. We get to see Britney perform two songs - Born To Make You Happy and From The Bottom Of My Broken Heart - from her debut album, Baby One More Time which has sold 24 million copies worldwide! This section is taken from USA Disney Channel's ""Britney Spears and Joey McIntyre In Concert"" programme. This section is splendid and the performances are very upbeat.OVERALL GRADE: 10/10All in all, Time Out With Britney is an absolute must have for every Britney fan in the world! If you like this video, you have to buy Britney's other music home videos - Britney Spears Live And More!, Britney: The Videos and Britney Spears Live From Las Vegas. But if there's one Britney video you should buy first, it's definitely Time Out With Britney - buy it now from Amazon!",N/A

724215,"While this film sports an impressively interesting premise (a woman is tragically forced into a fatal accident, charged with manslaughter and forced to live with an electronic bracelet (house arrest) in a cheap loft in a dangerous neighborhood while she awaits her trial), very good acting, a decent script, compelling set design, camera work and lighting, and a nostalgic sound track, Cherish doesn't entirely succeed.Tim Blake Nelson (O' Brother, Where Art Thou?, the Good Girl) is superb as the leading man who reluctantly falls in love with Robin Tunney's unfortunate victim, Zoe Adler. Tunney, herself, leaves little to be desired as she spends much of the feature isolated on camera. It's always an accomplishment when you spend large chunks of a picture alone and still suceed. Unfortunately, the plot details are too often unfulfilled and characters are underdeveloped. One wonders how Zoe goes from blabbering, blubbering nerd with terrible fashion and hair (who somehow still manages, at 29, to get an impressive list of first dates) to a self-assured, Run Lola Run-like independent woman without a single interlude of self-pity. Even Zoe's angry scenes--when she finally lashes out about the extreme injustice being inflicted on her--come too late and seem forced. One also wonders what it is about Zoe that causes her mysterious stalker to choose her as the subject of his fascination; her love for classic pop songs (including Tainted Love and the 60's version of Cherish) simply isn't enough. The presence of a gay, Jewish drawf bound to a wheelchair (while a frequent source of comic relief) is also jarring. Only one, relatively minor scene, discusses these identifying characteristics and, I might add, does so very quickly. It feels almost as though this character is supposed to be more significant than he actually is. In addition, there is a running string (literally) of logical inconsistencies that one cannot reconcile. Zoe has 57 feet worth of wandering room. This means she can't go down the stairs outside of her loft, but it doesn't stop her from climbing a ventilation shaft, nearly to the roof of her building. Lastly, the film evidentally spans two years, but one would be hard pressed to know it.Still--despite all of these flaws--the film is quite entertaining. There are some chilling, unconvential romantic moments between Nelson and Tunney that leave the viewer excited and laughing. In fact, Nelson's Bill Daly is the only character whose actions are never doubtful, in large part because of these scenes. There are also some biting lines of dialogue (""I wouldn't date so many men if even one would call me back"") and a lot of fun moments as Zoe attempts to escape and then circumvent her imprisonment. There is also a wonderfully suspenseful scene as Zoe--through Daly's help--seeks out the true criminal.In other words, none of the aforementioned faults are deal breakers. The viewer still watches the bulk of this film feeling fulfilled, feeling satisfied. And then comes the final sequence of the flick. While the end isn't necessarily a deal breaker either, it does come very very close, as it is unexplained and largely illogical.In the end, Cherish has several memorable moments and is certainly worth viewing, but it is not without faults.",N/A

385848,"One of the best films to feature The Beatles, A Hard Day's Night captures a lost era in pop music and cinema. Writer Alan Owun followed the band around as part of his research incoporating actually comments and observations that the band made into his funny screenplay. Night represents a high water mark for the band; it's the first and only album  where all the material was written by John &amp; Paul. Lennon was very prolific during this period composing the bulk of the 13 tracks that ended up on the UK soundtrack and spread out over two albums in the US.Richard Lester's direction was sharp, witty and groundbreaking when Night came out. His approach shaped the film, music and television world for sometime. The Monkees television series was an attempt to recreate some of Lester's tricks used in this film and Help! the follow up. In many respects, Lester's musical sequences are among the first &quot;music videos&quot; in terms of style and content.The DVD comes stuffed with extras. The shorts and comments from those directly or indirectly involved in the film is still quite interesting. While I admire MGM/UA's version of Yellow Submarine (it looks stunning and the unfinished sequences and interviews with those who did the voiceovers are quite interesting), I wish that they had taken this approach to that film. The only think missing of note are comments from the most important folks involved--John, Paul, George and Ringo. Since they put forth most of their views in the Anthology perhaps it was felt that including them here would just duplicate that experience. Regardless, we could do with some fresh insight from Paul and Ringo and even audio commentary from Lennon's many interviews would have been welcome.The picture quality is sharp and crisp. A lot of care was obviously taken in the transfer to DVD. This is the second time around for the film and it is an improvement over the first although some fans would be hard pressed to tell the difference.The sound is nothing short of stunning and hopefully represents the type of upgrades we will see on the soundtrack album when it is re-released. One of the best early albums The Beatles made, A Hard Day's Night has held up remarkable well nearly 40 years later. Extras that might have been included (but aren't) could have included a DVD Audio or SACD version of the album, a replica of the press book and one sheet that came with the movie (suitable for framing of course). Still, the extras included here are nice and informative if not always as groundbreaking as the film itself.A great DVD that recaptures the glory of early Beatlemania, A Hard Day's Night stands as one of the best rock movies ever made.

Should son Furlong tell the truth as advocated by Streep or should he go with Neeson, who has already destroyed evidence on his behalf, and make up a new version of events in an effort to remain out of jail.The tagline of how far would you go to protect your own flesh and blood promises an awful lot more than it delivers.  Indeed, it never manages to raise tension, even in scenes that by rights should be the most interesting in the movie, such as the revelation of what really happened between Furlong and his girlfriend.  All performances are intact and correct; this is exactly the kind of role that fits Streep best (even though she was a whole lot more enjoyable in 'The River Wild'), Neeson is likewise very good in an unfortunately stereotypical role and even though Furlong is often typecast as the troubled teen he plays it better than any other.However, the primary flaw is that something that promises emotion never really reaches boiling point and despite the star names you can't help but think that it all looks very much like a TV movie.

16856,"""Poetic Justice"" is a total mess of a movie, but it's a rather fascinating, intriguing mess.  Unfortunately, this lackluster film would set the tone for the rest of John Singleton's career; he hasn't done a film worth our while since ""Boyz N the Hood."" 2 girls and 2 guys go on a road trip during which they bicker, fight, and squabble using long streaks of profanity at each other.  (For the record, this has got to be one of the most profanity-laced films I've ever seen) Janet Jackson more or less does a competent job with her performance, and Tupac stands out as well, but the real deal is Regina King, who sparkles and adds sass in every scene she's in.  Her scene during which she curses out her sexually impotent boyfriend is a real-eye opener.  Otherwise, this movie lacks focus and a reason to care for the characters and their predictaments.  It seemed like Singleton just filmed a random collection of great scenes and one-liners and left it at that.  So my verdict is this: see it for Regina King.

160115,"Out of all of Mike Leigh's brilliant films, &quot;Career Girls is probably my favorite.This is a wonderful character study and look at the friendship of two English women during two different periods in their lives.In the film we meet Hannah (actress Katrin Cartlidge) and Annie (actress Lynda Steadman) former college roomates, who are having their first reunion in six years. These two are a regular pair of Mutt &amp; Jeffs. Hannah is tall, and thin with a caustic wit that is full of spit and vinegar. In contrast Annie is petite, shy and quite mousey in pesonality.As one of the characters is quoted as saying &quot;together they would make the perfect women&quot;.During the film we listen to their converstions as they travel about London remenicing, eating and even humorously go hunting for a flat. It is during all this, that the viewer is treated to flashbacks of how these now, smartly dressed, well coiffed, 'career gals', forged and created this important friendship in their relative youth. We are shown that back in the late eighties/early nineties they were a scruffy, punky looking pair, who went through thick and thin together.The movie shows us how in their outward appearance they might have changed  drastically, but on the inside they pretty much remain the same people (if not a bit more mature and cynically seasoned in nature).Actresses, Katrin Cartlidge and Lynda Steadman are marvelous in the two lead roles of this film.Both are totally believable playing these two interesting, yet imperfect women at different ages.Mike Leigh has written and directed a lovely drama/comedy, which really touches the heart as we get to know the characters(past &amp; present). The film also has a great soundtrack that features the '80's/90's pop music of The Cure. This is a really wonderful film that will move most movie fans!",N/A

By itself its a good scary movie and the shark is more real looking in this installment.  The gore is definetly over the top in this one remember when the guy got stuck in the shark's throat.

579407,"Pearl Jam has been one of my favorite bands ever since I was wearing flannel and being an angst filled.  This DVD has it all, old, new, and everything in between.  With a 28 song setlist, this disk has quite a bit to offer.  The picture quality is not the best, but it has that ""old movie"" kind of feel.  I do believe that this was done quite intentionally.  The sound, on the other hand, is absolutely amazing.  I picked this up right when it first came out. I took it home and proceeded to pump it through my Digital 5.1 home theater system and it just rocked.A nice thing about the DVD is that the setlist includes some of the non-album B-sides from the old record singles. ""Leatherman,"" ""I got id,"" and ""Long Road"" are all rarities included.  The only disappointments were the absence of ""Alive,"" ""Black,"" and a couple of other tracks that were not released as singles.  But hey, with 28 songs on the DVD, who am I to complain?  Additional highlights include ""Given to Fly"" where there is a person signing the whole song.  Why anyone would sign a concert is beyond me, but, it is beautiful to watch.  Ed brings her up on the main stage and dances with her. . . It is great.The extras on the disk are good. It has the video for ""Do the Evolution,"" and the video for ""Oceans."" The second of which, I don't think ever hit MTV. There is the ""Matt Cam"" that is mounted to the drum kit and shows the drummer through three whole songs.  There are little films that show where the tour went, show the band, and show the fans.  The ""places"" and the ""band"" mini-films have instrumental tracks going on in the background that are pretty cool.  The ""fans"" mini-film has a really great live version of ""Yellow Ledbetter"" playing.Above all else, the DVD is a culmination of 6 studio records and almost ten years of being one of the most influential bands of their time.  If not for bands like Pearl Jam, there would be no Nickleback, there would no Creed(even thought I am convinced that the world could do without Creed). This band rocked in 1991 and still rocks in 2002.  I hope they go on for a very, very, long time to come.epc",Pearl Jam - Touring Band 2000

718608,"Universal isn't generally considered highly for the quality of their serials, but I am noticing that those based on popular comic strips appear generally to be good adaptations.  I didn't like ACE DRUMMOND, but the first &amp; third FLASH GORDONs, THE ADVENTURES OF SMILIN' JACK, BUCK ROGERS, and JUNGLE JIM are all worthwhile chapterplays.Grant Withers is quite good in the title role as is Raymond Hatton as his light-hearted but not obnoxiously comic sidekick, Malay Mike.  The female lead is a strong actress in a strong role, no weeping willow who needs to be constantly rescued.  Henry Brandon as the Cobra and Evelyn Brent as Shanghai Lil are suitably menacing villians.A lot of stock wild animal footage enhances the total product.  And while the Cobra's stronghold isn't quite as sumptuous as Emporer Ming's, it'll definitely do.There aren't a lot of spectacular stunts nor are there any extraordinarily spectacular and imaginative chapter endings.  But the pacing is good with hardly a dull moment, and the chapter endings are mostly well done.The plot with two sets of villians and the standard missing heiress who's been raised by wild animals is complicated enough to sustain the 13 chapters.So if you enjoy jungle serials, you should like this one.",Jungle Jim
427539,"Lost Highway is a great movie. It starts with a saxophone player and he and his wife getting broken into and videotaped while they sleep. This saxaphone player is then arrested for the murder of his wife. In prison he morphes into Pete Dayton, an auto-mechanic who has an affair with a mobster's mistress. That's, more or less, the basic outline.I loved this movie. It was VERY creepy and totally mindboggling, 2 things typically found in a Lynch film. The 2 things that really stuck with me were the dark, gloomy, shadowy atmosphere, and of course robert blake as the ""mystery man"". It also really sticks with you because your constantly thinking about it, trying to contemplate it. The great thing about Lynch is that his films don't have a definitive meaning. He obviously had his own meaning, but your supposed to have your own thoughts and your own interpretation.All in all, this is a beautiful film. I would strongly reccomend it to any REAL film fan.

I asked my friend, &quot;What's this 'Used Cars' movie about?&quot; He didn't know and we assumed we would be bored sitting through 'Used Cars' just waiting for the main feature. Wow - we were so wrong! Used Cars literally had us laughing so hard we couldn't catch our breath.  My buddy and I had a job working on a lot, and this movie was kinda like seeing ourselves on the screen!Every character in this movie is memorable. It's a feel-good movie, but that's not to say it's for everybody. There are many things about this movie that make it unsuitable for children, not the least of which is the bad language (when has Jack Warden ever been able to do a part without considerable profanity?). Kurt Russell really established himself as a grown-up actor with this flick (after having done many childhood Disney films).There are many laughs to be had and if you can stand the cussing, you'll love this movie.",Used Cars VHS
595020,"Signs presents a unique twist on the alien genre, by combining it with a very personal story about a man who has lost his faith and how this affects his family.In Pennsylvania, crop circles are found on the farm of Graham Hess (Gibson), the town's former reverend. The circles test Hess's faith as he attempts to find out the truth behind them.Mel Gibson gives what is perhaps his best performance as a damaged father trying to do what he has come to believe is best for his children. Joaquin Phoenix, in quite a turn from his Oscar nominated performance as the antagonist in Gladiator, provides some humorous comic relief.This is a minimalist thriller. As repeatedly demonstrated by Hitchcock, and to a lesser extent Spielberg, what you don't see can be far more intense than what you do see. Director M. Night Shyamalan takes this to heart and uses lighting and sound to their full, suspenseful potential to indicate the presence of an other-worldly menace. James Newton Howard's Herrmann-esque musical score also adds greatly to the tension and mood.Signs falls apart during its outrageous finale that also tends to be unintentionally funny, and in my opinion, anti-climatic. All the atmosphere and anxiety that Shyamalan had built up throughout the film is abruptly released, resulting in an unsatisfying climax.",Signs
30948,"Here is a film that is a fascinating look at an era, a controversial business, and some one of a kind characters.Right from the open this story sucks you in, to use an appropriate term.  Marky Mark Wahlberg plays a young naive boy, whose personal endowments, when discovered and marketed by a pornographic movie maker played by the legendary Burt Reynolds, make him a star re-named hilariously ""Dirk Diggler"".  Unfortunately for Dirk, the pitfalls of stardom await and engulf him too soon after his star has risen.  Will he survive, or fall?  Watch this and see.The ensemble cast is knockout here.  The aforementioned Burt Reynolds makes a great comeback, and Wahlberg seems so real that you can feel just what he's going through as you view the film.  John C. Reilly is perfect as a fellow male porn star who helps mentor Dirk along with Reynolds.  I personally liked ""The Colonel"" a strange expressioned producer whose plastic smile and expression don't change a bit when viewing Dirk's credentials for the first time.  Hilarious!  Julianne Moore is outstanding as ""Amber Waves"", Dirks co-star.  She shows a wide range of emotion here.  There's also Heather Graham as ""rollergirl"", and William H. Macy in a great role as a camera man who is tortured by the infidelities of his wife, played by real life porn star Nina Hartley.  In a recurring situation she sleeps with crew members, which humiliates him in front of the entire set.  They're all waiting for a turn with his wife, as HE watches!  In a shocking scene, he finally snaps, but YOU must watch and find out how.Now that I've tempted you, I must tell you that I've only given you an IDEA of what goes on here.  What I can't tell you beyond some descriptive words, is the great mood and flavor of the movie.  It DEFIES description, you must experience it.  Paul Thomas Anderson, only on his second outing, uses music, cinematography, and fashion to recreate the 70s in a style dare I say ""comparable"" to veteran master director Martin Scorcese.  The movie has a magic all it's own from these elements used in such a highly effective manner, it truly sizzles.  I'd also compare it to Brian DePalma's masterpiece ""Carlito's Way"" (see my review), for it's ability to capture the 70s era with such quintessential style and excitement.""Boogie Nights"" is far more than a movie about the porn industry.  It's a commentary, a mockumentary, an adventure, a comedy, a drama, a treat for the senses, and a MUST SEE film that stands alone in it's originality.",N/A

Said thugs then gather the survivors together to carry their loot and ventilate an uppity crocodile after it attacks someone.  Too bad said croc is only a wee lass and its 30 foot mother shows up a short time later.  Mom is not pleased to find her baby dead and goes on the rampage...Oh, yeah...and the boyfriend hires Martin Kove (at least its a paycheck bud) to search for his girlfriend since no one else seems interested in looking for a downed passenger airliner.

43168,"The movie was one of the worst I had seen in my life. I did not have high hope for the animated series but I was very much surprised. The dialogue and, bizzarly enough, the acting are a hundred times as good as the film and the plot and characters are also much more intriguing.This is the second season of Spawn and it is crammed full of plot developments and great characters. Sam and Twitch get more room here. But since this has stopped airing as of 1999 there has been no fourth season. It's a shame since the one thing I can be sure ofis that the story could have had one hell of a send-off when it finally climaxes.It's more than likely in syndication somewhere so I'd start watching this if I were you. But be prepared. The violence is quite graphic and the overall tone of the stories ranges from kiddie fiddlers to satanic demons. Needless to say, it's not a cartoon for kids. It's an animated series for adults.The DVD is in full screen format, as originally drawn and is in Dolby 5.1 surround.

673487,"I am writing this review to balance the incredibly negative reviewsI have read about ""Bride of the Wind."" I read the reviews before andafter seeing the movie, and I am aghast at what I've read - reviewerswho happily give 4 (out of 4) stars to (I won't say it) like ""Breaking theWaves"" and ""Signs"" give this 1/2 star. Or how about ""Fargo"" and ""The BigLebowski?"" I think it's a travesty, and I wonder if there isn't some agendathat big-budget movies with top stars have to be reviewed favorably for thereviewer to be ""in,"" while a movie like this can be trashed so unfairly. ""Brideof the Wind"" deserves more merit than most movies if for no other reason thanit attempts to seriously portray the life of one of the 20th century's finest(opera) conductors/composers, though here obviously focusing on his talented,beautiful, outspoken, sometimes even callous wife, who indeed has numerousaffairs before, during (!), and after his death. Clearly the moviemakers focuson Alma because she outlives Mahler by more than 50 years, and has a more""racey"" life.I've been a fan of Mahler's symphonies for years, and I felt that theproducers of ""Bride of the Wind"" correctly chose to focus the bulk of themovie on Mahler and Alma. I found the performances of the actors who playedthe great composer and his wife more than acceptable, though not for a momentwould I call them ""perfect."" I was pleased with the selection of some of Mahler'ssymphonies and songs (though the musician who recommended the movie to me saidthat the conducting sequences were very poor!). I enjoyed Alma's frankly sayingwhat many have felt about Mahler's long, operatic-like symphonies when they firstmet - that is a topic of its own, for sure, though Mahler has won out over time,thanks to supporters like the greats Bernstein and Shostakovich. If not, perhapsno one would have ever made this movie. I also thought that the movie did a goodjob of portraying the tensions in the Mahlers' marriage, the problems Mahler hadbecause he was a Jew who had to convert to Christianity to advance his career, theoutspokeness of Alma, as well as the tragic death of one of their daughters(foreshadowed well and accurately during a scene when Alma asked Mahler why hewas composing music that sounded so tragic, when their lives were going so well).I could go on and on praising what I felt were the good parts of this, the bulkof the movie. The cinematography was also very well done throughout and realistic.The lines for the minor players were for the most part well written and acted.Indeed after Mahler died Alma went on to a number of relationshipswith artists of the highest talent, and I won't argue that this part ofthe movie was as well done as her time with Mahler. But few movies, especiallymovies that attempt to deal with complex lives and issues as this one, are perfect,and other than the weird portrayal of the architect who became her second husband(and who knows if the man wasn't as depicted in his personal life?), I foundthe performances decent. The actor who played the passionate, expressionist painterwho somehow survived after being shot and bayonneted in WWI did a superb job.I must repeat, ""Bride of the Wind"" is maybe only a slightly aboveaverage movie, but compared to the big-budget nonsense that praiseprostitution, misrepresent aliens and crop circles, trite ""who dunnits,""to say nothing of the gore and violence that are the mainstay of Hollywoodfare, the movie is easily worth watching (and enjoying) in my opinion.",Bride of the Wind

667871,"Based on a true story, &quot;LE TROU&quot; is a 42 year old French thriller that is little known in the U.S. but is being (re)discovered by videophiles as a tense, sweat-inducing masterpiece.  The plot is amazingly simple: Five guys in a prison cell awaiting trial, plot an escape by digging a hole (&quot;le trou&quot;) into the Parisian sewers.  The perfect black and white cinematography, the ultra minimalist plot, confined setting and shifting character relationships make this a kind of Zen noir meditation on the primal, universal, desire to be Free.  Director Jacques Becker died shortly after this film was completed, and this is a fitting epitaph to a truncated prize-winning career. The film opens with a statement that removes all obstacles to suspending disbelief.  Jean Keraudy, one of the real life participants of the events depicted in the movie, and an actor in the movie, says, &quot;My Friend Jacques Becker recreated a true story in all its detail. My story. It took place in 1947 at the Sant&eacute; prison.&quot;  The thing that intrigued Becker was the ingenuity of the scheme and the courage of the undertaking.  Three members of the original escape served as consultants and Keraudy himself plays the character Roland in the film.  The suspense never lets up as we participate with these desperate, ingenious, meticulous, men as a collective force seeking freedom.  There's a feeling of real time and no music score to enhance or detract.  The DVD has no significant extras.  The widescreen transfer is clean and sharp and the sound is crisp.  It's in French with optional, easy to read subtitles and there's a six page booklet with two interesting essays.

Keep in mind that Mike Meyers plays Austin Powers, Dr. Evil, Goldmember, Fat Bastard. He does an amazing job and you can't even tell it is him.Directed by Jay Roach (Meet The Parents, Mystery, Alaska) the film tells the tale of 7's undercover agent Foxy Brown played by Beyonce Knowles (know for the pop group Destiny's Child) who helps track the whereabouts of the Evil Dr. Evil and the disgusting dead skin eating Goldmemeber.Everyone is back - including Michael York (Logan's Run, Island Of Dr. Monroe) as Secret Defense Leader Nigel and Seth Green (Rock Star, Rat Race) as Dr. Evil misguided and somewhat confused son.The most amazing thing is all the cameo appearances that are in the movie and how they got everyone to do a minute or two in the film.

577022,"First off, I found this movie hard to understand at times, the English accents were so thick, I really had to force myself to pay very close attention to everything.There came a particular scene in ""sexy beast"" that forced me to turn it off as it held no revelence to the film whatsoever.  If it was to the director and writer, I failed to see what this was supposed to bring to the film.  Also, the over used foul term that begins with c and ends with t was used more like it was a regularly used word.  Well, it is a very disgusting word, and I don't know why the writer chose this word.  It must be a very frequently spoken in England.  Also, I just think there is far too much swearing.  Do screenwriters really think that making the characters swear is going to make a film?The reason I started my review with this gripe is because this is what brought it down to just three stars. I thought it was a very entertaining, fast paced, in your face love story/heist/gangster movie, and I liked it.  It's original and daring and is bold.Ben Kingsley, who is playing perhaps the most evil I have ever seen him play, is outstanding!  What an actor!  Here is an actor who is so versatile, and his performance is so amazing.  I just can't believe the audacity of Don Logan, his character here.  This is one of the most menacing characters on film.  The dialogue that springs from his lips is truly mouth dropping and just down right shocking at times.Gal, played with great precision by Ray Winstone, is a just retired ""gangster""  and is asked by Logan to do a job.  Logan, is beastly and was once romantically linked to one of them women in the film. Gal is married to Deedee, a former porno actress.  She isn't the one from Logan's affair.  She is very happily married to Gal who totally seems to adore her.I will not give much more away about this film, but it is very much worth viewing to the viewer with an open mind.  There is some gore and graphic scenes that may be disturbing to some.However, it has a good plot that kept me watching to the end once I cued the dvd back up.

It reminds us that our dreams and fantasies have always served to inspire us in the real world. From dreams come reality...In the film, a modern day man is drawn into a world he could only have imagined in his wildest dreams when he is suddenly spirited away into the service of a kindly Wizard, to help defeat the forces of darkness in a realm of fantasy. Although not exactly a new concept, it has a unique twist, for this is no ordinary man, he is a man of science and reason with a unique connection to this realm....Visually the film was a feast for the eyes - filled with exquisitely designed characters - fearsome creatures, colorful wizards, dashing heroes, and beautiful ethereal maidens (and best of all, no cutesy Disney-ish characters for comedy relief). Although the animation lacked the type of enhanced visuals, hyperkinetic action, and 3-D realism of later works of animation, I think that was not such a bad thing in this case. Although the animation looked a bit flat, such careful use of elegant simplicity actually enhanced this film - like a beautifully illustrated fairy tale book brought to life. The film featured a fine voice cast of well known Hollywood actors (John Ritter, James Earl Jones, etc.) who really seemed to be enjoying their roles.It's still a favorite after all these years. It's a shame that it never got the greater recognition it deserved, while lifeless formulaic Disney fluff like Snow White, Cinderella, etc. became classics. But I guess that's the power of big corporation and marketing. I bet things would not have been so if this film was produced and distributed by Disney as opposed to Rankin and Bass.Although I now own a brand new copy of the latest tape, I must admit the childish and somewhat ugly cover art is a bit deceptive. Artistically it does this film no justice, but I guess from a marketing point of view, if it enhances sales and hence greater recognition, so be it. I guess there is a method to their madness.... Anyway, enjoy!",N/A

716163,"I've been trying to collect the entire Babylon 5 series since 1997, when it was only available on tapes, through a subscription to a club.  Warner was impressed by the sales and began releasing them commercially on tape and laserdisc, only to stop almost halfway through when DVD rumors caused sales to plummet.  Now, at last, my dream given form... an entire season of my favorite televison series, in a full-season box!  Will I live long enough to see the other four seasons issued?  One can hope...This DVD box offers more than any of the previous releases.  These are brand-new transfers; for the first time the widescreen prints are available (a big plus to owners of widescreen TVs, like me).  The sound has been remixed in Dolby Digital 5.1, with a subwoofer channel that had me leaping across the room to turn it down before my windows shattered.  Superb picture and video... and I haven't got to the extras yet.Since Babylon 5 is more of a novel-for-television than a series, you really need to watch every episode in order to fully appreciate the story.  The first season has rough edges, as the show's producers and writers figured out what worked and what didn't work.  The best part of these shows is the performance of Michael O'Hare as Commander Sinclair.  O'Hare's persona doesn't seem to work that well as a an action hero (which may have something to do with why he was replaced), but as O'Hare finds his way around the character he develops Sinclair into a profoundly spiritual leader, with a depth and breadth that's virtually without parallel in American television.  This is a process that fits in well with later events in the story... and this is what makes B5 so unique: the characters change.I like Star Trek and the X-Files, but I like Babylon 5 better because the characters actually develop and change in response to their experiences.  This makes the story more realistic and dramatic and less like ordinary TV.  Compare G'Kar in the first episodes of the opening season with G'Kar in Season 3, and Season 4, and Season 5... and you'll see a real masterpiece of acting, as the character becomes so much more than one could imagine after watching the first few episodes.So, start here, and be prepared to watch each episode more than once, as the best shows are packed with rich details that yield greater meaning when you know how things turn out in the end...  B5 is never predictable.  It will surprise you.",N/A

But when Andy gets Buzz Lightyear, a space ranger, Woody's place is jeopardized.  Woody has to deal with his feelings of jealousy, especially when he and the delusional Buzz become lost toys.Toy Story 2 followed 4 years later and is the rare sequel that is at least as good as the original, if not better.  This time, an evil toy collector has kidnapped Woody, and his head swells when he finds out how valuable he really is.  Can Buzz and the other toys find him before he decides he doesn't want to return to Andy?Toy Story will forever have a place in cinema history as the first completely computer animated movie.  But Pixar did a great job making sure it's a movie people will enjoy seeing years from now.  The toys are sympathetic characters and the story is wonderful.  The site gags and animation make it a treat for adults as well.Toy Story 2 works as well as it does because it builds on the base of the first movie to tell a second story.  Pixar introduced new characters and a fresh story idea while still letting us see and enjoy to characters we loved from the first movie.  And the animation has only gotten better over time.  Yet the animation is there to tell a story, and the story telling and humor never lag.The Ultimate Toy Box is a must for collectors or anyone interested in the animation process.  Not only are the two movies showcased well on their respective discs, but the extras are phenomenal.  I have spent hours going through the third disc soaking up information and trivia.  The features commentaries on the first two discs are a fascinating look into what really goes into making these movies.  I learned so much from them alone.The two Toy Story movies will long be remember for being great films.  Any film collector owes it to himself or herself to have both in their collection.  And if you want to learn the most about these two movies, the people behind them, and what it took to make them, buy the Ultimate Toy Box.  You will be entertained and educated for hours.",N/A
708209,"I have been doing Pilates for a month now. I had to set this DVD aside for 3 weeks before I could try this workout. It is FAST! On my other tapes there is a lot of instruction and the exercises are performed slowly.On this one the BASIC workout has 10 exercises and is 7 minutes long. The instruction is given, as the moves are being performed, not before. It is great, but it will take you time to really know the exercises through and through before you are able to follow along.The Intermediate workout has 15 xercises and is 12 minutes long. On my other DVD's, 15 xercises amounts to at least 45 minutes. I do agree with this DVD, but like I said it will take you time to really know the exercises before you can follow along at this fast pace- A pace like in no other Pilates tape I know of. The exercises themselves are classic Pilates and are done very well and gracefully.The advanced workout has 25 exercises and is 20 minutes long. This one is good and the man doing the exercises actually sweats a lot, something I have yet to see in any other Pilates film. This is a really challenging workout!The quality of this DVD is outstanding. You are sure to get a classic Piliates workout of the highest caliper. I do wish there was a one minute pause between exercises so you have time to get out of one exercise and into the next one. It will take you a lot of practice before you can follow along with the people in this workout, but the rewards will be superior to the other tapes. I find it really nice to have so many workouts one one DVD. An amazing value for such quality. I suggest you buy Brooke Silar's book The Pilates Body as well. This book has all the exercies of this DVD, but it also explains them in fine detail that is missing in this DVD.",N/A

Anyway lot of folks out there think it wrongfully depicts cops as basically corrupt, anti-social, authoritarian parasites and really I've met many of those types in my very bad habit of driving while black but there are good cops out there and they are the norm.  This movie was very disturbing in the sense that people in a position of power and authority will more than likely abuse it and shamefully at that I mean police officers are human beings and given power and authority on certain levels can turn anybody into a sociopathic monster.

673286,"A very strange visionary tale that I believe suffers in adaptation from book to the silver screen, THE HANDMAID'S TALE does boast a very solid performance from an exuberant Natasha Richardson and an unusually stoic Robert Duvall.  While I'm not exactly certain whether or not the point of the picture is made as soundly as it could be, the theme of genetic perfection is often times handled all too delicately on film.  That said, the films does contain the pivotal scene of attempted conception, with Duvall and Richardson doing the nasty, while Duvall's wife aids somewhat in the process; this single scene, filmed in almost a basic documentary style and void of passion, stays with the average viewer long after the picture fades.",N/A
137687,"It might be. Madcap, manic, wildly funny flick that is deservedly ranked as one of the best films ever. Two down-on-their-luck musicians (Joe and Jerry, Tony Curtis and Jack Lemmon) accidentally witness the St. Valentine's Day Massacre, and pose as women to join an all-woman band and escape to Florida. But romantic entanglements, identity switches, and an angry mob boss converge in a lunatic finale that is an absolute riot. Director Wilder and writer I.A.L. Diamond have constructed a endlessly hilarious farce that may leave viewers breathless. The gags come at a machine gun pace, featuring some very witty banter and a few censor-skirting double entendres. Curtis and Lemmon are great, Marilyn Monroe is a blast in one of her best parts, and an excellent supporting cast, including Joe. E. Brown as a playboy who has his eyes on ""Daphne"" (Lemmon), veteran character actor Pat O'Brien as Mulligan, and George Raft as the take-no-prisoners mob boss. There are so many priceless moments--the party on the train, the ""Shell Oil Junior"" bit on the beach, the dining room segment under the tables, the memorable ending (Brown with one of the most famous lines in movie history, which I'm not going to reveal here...oh, and watch his expression after he says it), many, many more.The film proves that one does not need flatulence or body-fluid-as-hair-gel jokes to be funny. Indeed, this film has ten times the laughs of any recent movie. Might be the late and lamented Billy Wilder's best film-and that's saying something! (Sunset Boulevard, Double Indemnity, The Seven Year Itch, The Lost Weekend, The Apartment, Stalag 17, Sabrina, many more) First-rate, from start to finish...and a bargain on DVD. Rent it, buy it, borrow it, whatever--see this film!",N/A
38561,"Turns out you don't need guns and car crashes to make a macho action flick.  This movie does it all in an office where everybody wears suits.  But there's so much testosterone oozing out of their pores it could be a Rambo film if you closed your eyes.  And the way the actors pounce on their clients, there isn't enough left for a buzzard after they're done tearing into said clients.This movie deals with the world of high-pressure selling for stock brokerage firms.  These companies still exist, even after Enron, 9/11, and the stock market meltdown, but were thriving even more before all this happened.  Their tactic is to hard-sell customers on stocks for various new companies.  Only those that make the sales get the riches.  It doesn't matter that the stocks are from faltering, or worthless companies, you'd better buy, and buy a lot if they call you.So it's not surprising that after our hero (Ribisi) gets caught running a casino in his dorm room, it's here that he turns to for ""legitimate"" employment.  At first he goes with the lifestyle, and even becomes good at it.  By movie's end, though, certain characters see the harm they do to their suckers, er, clients, and certain characters have to make choices on how to proceed with their lives. Others will have this choice made for them.This movie is scary in that it really shows how these high-pressure salesmen work.  They wear suits, but they are the shiny sharkskin types that Billy Crystal in ""Analyze This"" mentioned could be used as mirrors.  So this brilliant piece of costuming tells you exactly what kind of people you are dealing with.  Vin Diesal in a suit, in a very good performance, looks just as menacing here as in his later roles.  And it's this portrayal of people who can mentally suck your blood out that make it a very scary, but very good movie to see.",N/A

590205,"For my money, no director working today knows better what to do with a huge ensemble than Robert Altman. Regrettably, he didn't win the Oscar this year for Best Director which remains a bit of a mystery (pun intended) to me. ""Gosford Park"" is arguably his most ambitious work to date. To some viewers, the film meanders quite a bit for more than an hour, flittering back and forth between the frantic work pace and never-ending preparations of the downstairs household staff and their employers lush, opulent living and activities upstairs, all during the course of a shooting weekend in the English Countryside. The standout performances include a devilishly spoiled Maggie Smith (whose character as she puts it 'hasn't a snobbish bone in her body') and Kristin Scott Thomas as the lady of the manor whose icy demeanor is off-putting to most but quite attractive to young fellow posing as a servant (a sly and witty Ryan Phillipe). The murder mystery, it has been reported in the entertainment press, wasn't actually added to the film until about 6 weeks into the shoot but you would hardly know since the gradual buildup to that crescendo is so brilliant and almost off-handed! After watching this terrific cast of A-list actors scurry about thier daily activities and then settle into a game of bridge, Brandy, conversation and music (provided by the dashing and alternately grating Jeremy Northam at the piano) a blood-curdling scream from the study snaps everyone from their selfish state and thrusts the film forward to a surprising and satisfying finish. I won't give away more than that (in case you haven't seen it yet) but I will say that there is another tasty little subplot involving two downstairs service people (a magnificent Helen Mirren and Clive Owen). Special kudos to the set designers and costume department for a job well done and for some of the most lush cinematography in recent film history!Brilliant.",N/A
697656,"Robbie Williams is a great singer and everybody should check this live DVD. It's a celebration of old classics performed to a very selected audience, in an one night only concert at Royal Albert Hall. Robbie performs with a big band, recreating some classics --&quot;Things&quot;, &quot;Beyond the sea&quot;, &quot;my way&quot;, etc. There's an original song composed for Robbie's album called &quot;I will talk and hollywood will listen&quot; which captures the show spirit. Robbie is an interesting artist, because he's on the stage in a tribute to Mr. Sinatra, but at the same time tells dirty jokes and talk with the audience. One of the greatest moments of the show happens when Robbie sings a very emotional duet with Mr. Sinatra, featured at the big screen on the stage. The royal albert hall did not resist the performance of &quot;my way&quot;, leading Robbie to tears with the audience's response to this song.I'm sure some people may have criticized Robbie for taking the big step of performing sinatra's songs. But if you watch this show, you'll see he is a very talented singer and did a great job. The show/CD are a tribute and an invtation to his fans, who probably do not listen to old classics.But the DVD has a lot to offer. Besides the whole concert, it brings a documentary &quot;Well sung&quot; with the backstage and recording process of Robbie's CD. &quot;The day job&quot; is also a documentary, with bits of Robbie's videos and performances for TV. Very intriguing! Also the DVD has the &quot;somethin'stupid&quot; video and the backstage of the shooting with nicole kidman.Two things I missed: the live performance of &quot;somethi'stupid&quot;, even without nicole, and english subtitles to the great songs performed.Anyway, it's a 5-stars DVD!",N/A

665876,"MONSTER FROM THE OCEAN FLOOR stars Anne Kimball, Stuart Wade, Dick Pinner, Inez Palange, Jonathan Haze, and David Garcia.This movie stars a strong female lead, who is fairly easy on the eyes without the obscenity of modern-bathing suits.  Julie Blair, played by Anne Kimball, investigates stories of an underwater, single red-eyed, monster that is terrorizing a small Mexican community.Steve Dunning (Stuart Wade), a marine biologist working in the cove provides the romantic interest.  He pedals around a real neat one-man mini-sub.  Without giving away the ending, this fact will be important at the movie's ending.A local witch influences one of the peasants to make an attempt to sacrifice her, ""the fair one,"" as an appeasement to the monster.  His haphazard attempts make us sympathetic to him in a movie that drags somewhat and where there is little significant action.I read that this was Roger Corman's first production, making it a must see for his fans and collectors.  The director is Wyott Ordung who also appears as the superstitious Pablo in the movie.  Roger Corman is in the movie, too, as Tommy.  There is nothing on the box from RHINO or on the DVD to tell us this.Kimball gives a good performance although the other actors often come off wooden and as if they are reading.  The music is not bad and compliments the suspenseful water scenes.  The one-eyed monster comes off cheap by today's standards, maybe even by those in 1954, but it is still rather neat with its one bulging eye.  Unfortunately, we do not see much of it.  The underwater scenes with the monster used a puppet in an aquarium.  The live sequences, with just the swimmers and the sub was purported to be actual deep-sea footage.  Usually such shots are done a few inches under water in someone's pool.The RHINO DVD is a conventual pan/scan 1.33:1. There are no extras, just the movie and a few chapter divisions.  The picture is pretty clear although the sound is below average.  I had to turn my speakers way up.  Part of the problem rests with the original production.  There is too much background noise and the constant blowing wind becomes a distraction.In retrospect the peasant woman, really a witch who disavows the local padre for her ancient superstitions, comes across as a real monster.  However, she has little screen time.  Further, while the character played by Kimball incessantly seeks the monster, she goes out unarmed and passes out every time she sees it.  While she has proof of her discovery at the end, she goes back into the water looking for it again, for no good reason whatever.  It simply provides the final situation for the movie's mild climax.  The logic fails somewhat at this point.Nevertheless, I like B-grade movies and this is a fair one.>No foul language or blasphemy.>Conventional bathing suits, but no bikinis and no nudity.>Light romance, but nothing lewd and no sexual situations.>Light plot violence.",N/A
595310,"This is another good, creepy movie from this director that will have you jumping out of your seat at times, but it has many weaknesses.  The acting is good overall, but the characters seem mostly half thought out.  Too much of the humor seems forced.  There is some interesting philosophy, but the moralistic ending seemed a little trite to me.Being a sci-fi fan, I was disappointed by this aspect of the movie.  There's nothing especially original here -- the aliens are just evil monsters with a corny Hollywood alien movie weakness that makes them easy to defeat.  Though the trailer and title of the movie seemed to focus on the mystery of crop circles, the explanation for them is fairly uninteresting. I could go on about the lack of logic and originality of the sci-fi aspect of this movie, but science fiction isn't important in this movie, which is why it is treated so cursorily.  This is just a psychological thriller about a family in deadly peril, and a man in the depths of a spiritual crisis. On that basis, it's worthwhile.",Signs

355954,"*""V,"" the NBC Television mini-series which first aired nearly two decades ago, was intended to be seen for its entertainment value though, admittedly, using some pre-mid 20th century historical elements to contribute to the overall plot and theme of the story -- specifically World War II Germany (the alien ""national symbol"" even resembling an incompleted 'connect-the-dots' swastika). Little did the writers, directors and producers of this mini-series realize that their sci-fi project was a late 20th century prophecy which would begin seeing fulfillment in the just few months shy of the dawning years of the 21st century.The purchase of this DVD marked the very first time of my ever seeing this feature, and I was instantly hooked, especially by its dazzling high-octane opening sequence. The special effects were also nicely done considering the time period in which it was made, that it was a ""made for television"" movie, and the fact that it was made on the cheap. (It was also nice to see Robert Englund as something other than a flame-scarred tragedy figure.)The story of ""V"" revolves around a race of seemingly benevolent space aliens who look, sound and act a lot like us. They convince the world that they are our friends and only wish to extend the hand of cooperation & unity and work toward a ""common good"" where all will benefit. But there are those who have some very gnawing suspicions about the ""Visitors,"" that they are not quite everything they appear to be -- which is a serious understatement, for it turns out that the real agenda of the ""Visitors"" is to rape the planet of its most precious resources and enslave humanity.""V's"" creators obviously tried to parallel the story with National Socialist Germany, but in hindsight it becomes frighteningly obvious that ""V"" was as much a vision of the ""historical future"" as it was a view to the ""historical past!""

Where does one stop with all of the comparisons? The similarities are virtually endless! The only thing missing is a distinctive insignia to rally behind (that is, of course, if one doesn't already consider the American Flag to be it, especially since the unfortunate tragedy of ""911""), designer costumes for the ""Youth Brigades,"" and entire sweeps of towns and mass imprisonments.In ""V"" the violators of our basic and most cherished liberties were lizard-creatures wearing human-looking skin; In 21st century America they are human through-and-through, but they do often speak with the 'forked tongue' of a reptile!The makers of this mini-series probably had no idea they were developing a  story with an eye on a direct future outcome, which makes this series even more enjoyable and even more disturbing to watch.

296936,"First, I have to dispel some of the myths about the movie purported not only by reviewers on this site, but mainstream film reviewers and social commentators.1. It's true that a consortium of Dayton (Hillsboro) businessmen hired Scopes (Cates) to 'take the fall' because it would mean a boon to the local economy, but there were also a number of people opposed to the teaching of evolution that thought the trial was a sham and let it be known.  The insults and threats were hurled from both sides.  The film is a dramatization from Cates and Drummond's point of view.  The threats and intimidation are shown to make Cates a sympathetic character and present him in the light of an underdog with the world against him. To quote Matthew Harrison Brady, ""If St. George had killed a dragonfly instead of a dragon, who would remember him?""2. Also, ""...Young Earthism wasn't a factor in the Scopes trial.""Here is the direct transcript from Day 7 of the Scopes trial (Darrow examines Bryan):Q--Have you any idea how old the earth is?A--No.Q--The Book you have introduced in evidence tells you, doesn't it?A--I don't think it does, Mr. Darrow.Q--Let's see whether it does; is this the one?A--That is the one, I think.Q--It says B.C. 4004?A--That is Bishop Usher's calculation.Q--That is printed in the Bible you introduced?A--Yes, sir....Q--Would you say that the earth was only 4,000 years old?A--Oh, no; I think it is much older than that.Q--How much?A--I couldn't say.Q--Do you say whether the Bible itself says it is older than that?A--I don't think it is older or not.The point of Darrow's (Drummond's) cross-examination was not whether or not the earth is 6000 or 6,000,000 years old, but to get Bryan (Brady) to admit the possibility that there may be inaccuracies in the Bible (exactly the same thing Scopes did).3. ""In court transcripts, the evolutionists open (openly?) spoke of their racist views..."".  I can't find anything to support or refute this statement.  In fact, the Judge excluded all expert testimony relating to the origin of man and life (both in the film and trial).  If that's the case, then the only racist statements that could be entered would be by Darrow or Scopes or by prosecution witnesses.  Check out Drummond's speech about ""...turning Catholic against Protestant and Protestant against Protestant"".  It's Darrow's speech nearly word for word and shows the feelings of the man.  It's hard to believe that he would have approved of the Third Reich after hearing or reading this.4. ""The evolutionists won the court case.  False.  They lost"".  I have to wonder if the reviewer watched the end of the movie.  SPOILER: Cates and Drummond do lose the case.  Cates is fined $100 and Drummond says that they have no intention of paying and will challenge the ruling.The Final Verdict: Like any movie ""Based on a True Story"",  Inherit the Wind is bound to stir up controversy over whether or not it really happened that way.Stephen King once wrote a review of ""The Amityville Horror"" in which he said that the mere medium of film makes the story fiction and not fact.  That's the case here.  Inherit the Wind is written from a certain point of view (just like this review, and the review before mine, and the review before that) and points of view are just that -- points of view.As for the movie itself, what more can be said?  The non-trial dialogue is crisp and brilliant  (Kelly's line to the woman who offers him a nice, clean place to stay always brings a smile to my face).  March and Tracy are appropriately titanic in the courtroom and low-key in the rest (the porch scene, specifically).  Stanley Kramer's direction is spot-on, getting close-ups at the right time and pulling back to reveal the packed courtroom at others (look for the canted and off-center frames during the prayer meeting).The DVD looks just fine, preserving the aspect ratio is very important to a film like Inherit the Wind which uses the frame to tell a story.  I could have used some extras (comparison of the real life trial and the movie).  The extas are a minor point, though, the film is enough.Inherit the Wind is a brilliant film based on a brilliant play based on a factual trial between two brilliant legal minds.  That is all that I, as a viewer, can ask.",N/A

1801,"This is a solid DVD of Don Giovanni, having particularly fine orchestral playing, and some of the best sound quality I have heard yet on DVD.Vocally, the cast is top-notch, with particular accolades going to those playing Donna Anna and Donna Elvira for their singing.  Samuel Ramey is an excellent Don Giovanni, and Leporello is also given a good reading.  Kathleen Battle as Zerlina sings well but her acting is quite weak, and her companion Masseto is likewise vocally adequate, but rather unconvinging acted.  In fact, my major critique of this production is that it is not theatrical enough.  Only the singer playing Leporello really convinces as an actor.  Ramey as Don Giovanni is also passable, but the two donna are rather static, and as I mentioned above Zerlina and Masseto get poor marks for their acting.  The cast also tends to look rather old for their roles - Masseto in particular hardly convinces as a young, fresh country lad, being played by a rather heavyset, middle-aged man with a large moustache.The stage is quite big, and the sets are likewise large and unwieldy.  Lighting is a problem - this is a very DARK Don Giovanni - and the pervading darkness and large sets unfortunately lends the production a rather cold feel that the non-acting of the principals does little to thaw.  I also must express some reservations about the final scene where Giovanni is (supposed to be) pulled into Hell by the Commendatore.  In this production, he is pulled not down to hell, but, strangely enough, beamed up to outerspace.  Despite my problems with this from a conceptual standpoint, I must admit that it is pulled off superbly, with special effects worthy of Star Wars.Although so far I've dwelled mostly on the negatives, this Don G. also has some major points in its favor.Karajan's direction, is, I think suberb.  I was somewhat apprehensive going in, given his reputation for rather heavy and slow interpretations of Mozart in his later years, but I don't think that is the case here.  While certainly not a speedy interpretation, none of the tempos ever felt seriously off to me, and pacing is very good.  The playing of the Vienna Philharmonic is glorious - I don't think it could be bettered (and I have heard MANY Don Giovannis).  Say what you will about Karajan in his later years, but on the evidence seen here, he was still able to get what he wanted from an orchestra, and they play for him with total commitment and dedication.  I also want to make special note of the recorded sound, which is some of the best I have heard from a DVD source.  It is stereo only, but when I hooked up my DVD player to my hi-fi system the sound that poured forth from my speakers was glorious - like having the Vienna Philharmonic right there in your living room.  It had everything you could ask for - presence, depth, soundstaging, and detail.  Picture quality is only average, however.  Although I have some reservations about the production, I still feel fairly confident recommending this Giovanni, since its musical and technical attributes are so superb.  It is also very reasonably priced for an opera on DVD ...At the very least, if one is unhappy with the production, simply turn off the t.v. monitor, and enjoy the audio portion.Of the DVD competition, I have seen only the Muti/La Scala production and the Losey film, both of which I find inferior to the present one.  The Muti suffers from all the flaws of this production - a too-dark set, non-existant acting, weak stage direction.  Add to that lousy recorded sound, vastly inferior orchestral playing, an interpretation from Muti that fails to take off, and a grainy, gritty picture. ...  Pass.  The Losey film works well as a movie, and is visually quite stunning, but the recorded sound is so atriciously bad that I cannot derive any musical satisfaction from it, despite many attempts.  The orchestra and singers sound distant, weak and tinny, and details are obscured by tons of tape hiss.  It's like listening to an old transistor radio...For those looking for a Don Giovanni on DVD with superb musical virtues above all, this is probably your best bet.  Those looking for a vital, lively production might be a little disappointed.  I am still awaiting a Don Giovanni on DVD to which I can give 5 stars.",N/A
399206,"This performance has gathered a great deal of critical praise, but it didn't work for me.  Part of the problem is that it is essentially a taped stage production.  Not that this is always a failing, but in this case it seemed to make Shakespeare's most driven play far too static.  Also, there was too much &quot;acting&quot; going on.  Especially from Olivier -- he was so busy trying to be &quot;black&quot; with the eye rolling, exaggerated vocalisms and gestures that I couldn't believe a word he said.  His Othello is a caricature.  This production has far fewer cuts than the more recent one with Fishburne, if that is a concern.

104896,"This 1998 film is set in seventeenth century Venice.  Very loosely based on history, it stars Catherine McCormack as Veronica Franco, a beautiful woman who chose to be a courtesan because the nobleman she loves, played by Rufus Sewell, is forced into an arranged marriage. What follows is a predictable story about how she becomes the lover of most of the well-born men of Venice and even has time to write some poetry on the side.  Not a bad idea for a story.  Unfortunately though, Ms. McCormack can't act although she does look pretty in some gorgeous costumes.  She keeps the same expression on her face throughout and I found it impossible to emotionally identify with her.  Jacqueline Bisset, cast as her mother who trains her for this profession, does a much better job but her role is much too small to save this film, which I found only mildly interesting.  There's also too much modern feminist rhetoric throughout.  I give this film only the shadow of a lukewarm recommendation.  There is much better stuff around.",N/A
520784,"If there is a better movie made I haven't seen it. Simply put Peter Jackson took the ""unfilmable"" classic trilogy by JRR Tolkien and made it into an instant classic film. How did he do it?He was faithful and trusted the source completely. The story is already a sure thing. It isn't the highest selling work of fiction in history for nothing. Jackson was dead on aim when trying to get the look, and feel JRR Tolkien expressed in print.The Lord of the Rings is about change. Middle-Earth is in the process of change and is very vulnerable. The time of the elves is ending giving away to man. This is a very sad thing and it is one of things expressed very well. The friendship between Sam and Frodo is also done very well. They are like war buddies prepared to give up their lives for each other. Throw in some awesome special effects and good fight scenes and you have it all. If you have never read the books you can't even appreciate the small things that are so detailed in the movie. Like when a character says something word for word from the book, or when Gandalf says ""Ah the Long Expected Party"" which is the name of the first chapter. Things had to be taken out simply to cut it down and make it fit. This is understandable. I also like seeing things that you aren't in the story but just mentioned like Gandalf going to Minas Tirith to look up the history of the ring. Above all the feel and the emotion are there.Ive heard one issue that it was unbelievable that a few heros could take out so many enemies. Well these heros are the most powerful and best warriors on middle-earth. They are lords trained in the art of battle no mere foot soldiers or anything. Plus they are going up against Orcs which are not greatly skilled and whose true threat is numbers. If it was too long for you then I think you have attention issues. Trash it if you must because the majority speaks for itself and Ive found that even the most learned Tolkien fans love it too. Btw it is not a Hollywood picture so quit calling it a ""typical hollywood film."" Also it is only 1/3 of the story.I cannot wait for the Two Towers and the Return of the King.

309227,"I've always been intrigued by ""The Two Mrs. Carrolls"" and always feel it is a far better film than how it is always judged. The film has a polished look to it and contains a suspenceful story that really keeps you on the edge of your seat, particulary in the second half.Certainly ""The Two Mrs. Carrolls"" is no ""Casablanca"" or ""The Maltese Falcon"" (but lets face it how many films like that come along in any actors career anyway?) but I feel from repeated screenings of it that it is a most interesting vechicle for Bogart in particular. He plays a character very different from his usual type of personas. I dont see that as a bad thing at all and I feel his craggy looks and dark demeanour are absolutely perfect for the role of Geoffrey Carroll,  a psychotic artist who paints portraits of his wives (hence the title) as the Angel of Death and then murders them. His pairing with Barbara Stanwyck is an original and fascinating one which sadly was never repeated but I feel, also contrary to critics belief that they team very well together. Barbara also takes a different stance in this film playing a nice girl who marries Geoffrey for all the right reasons only to discover the dark truth of the man she thought she knew when it is almost too late. Barbara has a sympathetic role here and she performs to her always high standard. She was always excellent as the heroine under threat and she beautifully modulates her performance here, moving from being an inlove new bride to someone witnessing a frightening chain of events that make her fear for her own life . The tension between the two once Sally (Stanwyck) begins to realise what is going on in Geoffrey's mind is the basis for the suspence that occurs in the story. Alexis Smith also scores (no mean task when up against Bogart and Stanwyck)in the role of the slinky and bitchy Cecily Latham who tries to come between Geoffrey and Sally. The scene at the afternoon tea in the Carroll's garden is very funny in a sarcastic kind of way and she is perfect as the femme fatale of the story.The set up  look of this film also adds greatly to its suspense element. The constant chiming of the towns Church Bells, the constant inclement weather through most of the second half as the tension rises, and  the dark sombre house really create the right atmosphere of impending doom. Peter Godfrey directed this film and was responsible for guiding Barbara Stanwyck through some interesting and diverse roles like ""Cry Wolf"" and ""Christmas in Connecticut"" two of my personal favourites of Stanwyck's work. While not the greatest director at Warner Bros Godfrey here directs with a sure hand and keeps the action bubbling along to the climax of the story.The other supporting players are also well chosen with the ever reliable Nigel Bruce playing his usual bumbling character, in this case the local doctor Dr. Tuttle who finds himself having to treat Sally for a mysterious ""illness' which in reality is Geoffrey trying to slowly poison her. Young Anne Carter really impresses in the role of Geoffrey's strangely mature daughter Beatrice by his first wife. Patrick O'Moore is also excellent as Charles Pennington, ""Penny"" a former love of Sally's who begins to suspect that all is not well in the Carroll household.As stated previously the last 30 minutes of the film as Sally begins to suspect Geoffrey's motives and tries to outsmart him are the best in the whole film. It is real nail biting action as Barbara tries to outwit her husband while not letting him know she is on to him. This occurs  in the midst of a violent storm once everyone else is out of the house. The scenes where Geoffrey finally loses his mind in homicidal rage and sets out to murder Sally are harrowing to witness and I feel Bogart handles this difficult piece of acting perfectly making Geoffrey a truly terrifing character.""The Two Mrs. Carrolls"" while not a great success on release is a film worth viewing. It certainly contains good work by both stars and is among my favourite Stanwyck performances. Try watching this as a late night treat during a storm, you are guaranteed a real nail biting time indeed!",N/A
693871,"I look through the various reviews of this title, and am consistently amazed at the lengths to which a fan of this series will go to justify George Lucas and this quickly dwindling franchise. I am a Star Wars fan. I grew up watching the classic trilogy, and was as excited as anyone could be about the prequels. Unlike a lot of Star Wars fans, I enjoyed the Phantom Menace. But I cannot say for an instant that Attack of the Clones was a good motion picture.Let me make one thing clear, however. As a visual artist, George Lucas has no peer. The worlds that he creates are astounding, rich, and full of life. It does not take long for the viewer to become lost in Mr. Lucas' unbelievable creations. Coruscant is a bustling hive of activity, immense and claustrophobic at the same time. Tatooine is a hostile land, teeming with grit and barely perceived danger. These are just two examples of George Lucas' artful hand at work. He is a creator of wonders. A purveyor of fantasy. A genius working at the top of his game.Now for the problems. This may be the most poorly written movie I have ever seen. The script is laughably bad. There were several points during the film, where I had to mentally keep myself from cringing. The scenes between Padme (Natalie Portman) and Anakin (Hayden Christiansen) are painful to watch, and frankly juvenile. I especially enjoyed the ""Sound of Music"" moment once Padme had made it back to her home planet of Naboo. (Watch the film, you can't miss it)I had hoped that Mr. Lucas could have distanced himself from the stilted and moronic dialogue that plagued the Phantom Menace. Sadly, it has gotten worse. He had reduced the Jedi Knights to mumbling, bickering old men, and he had made Senator Amidala a whiny, petulant crone. And Anakin....this character was butchered. Hayden Christiansen is so miscast in this role it is hard to believe he made it through his screen test. Mr. Christiansen is a fine actor, see My Life as a House for proof of his skill. But in the hands of Mr. Lucas and his script, he has been relegated to skulking in the corner like a reprimanded child.All in all, the Attack of the Clones is a Star Wars film, and for fans of the series, that is a great thing. I own the movie, as I own them all. But, heaping undue praise upon this film just because it is THIS film is not warranted. Even the greatest stumble from time to time. With this material, I had hoped for more from Mr. Lucas and company. Sadly, my expectations for Episode III are fading.One piece of advice. Mr Lucas, please give Larry Kasdan a call when you start the script for the third film. Please.....he does not seem to be very busy at the moment.",N/A
592784,"The Rock has successfully put himself in place to take over the action-hero title from Ah-nuld. We've seen this film before, dozens of times...but usually dubbed and with bad production values. I like The Rock; he is as great as he needs to be, and no more. He's fallible, but still kicks serious butt. The Rock is very cool: fun, self-effacing, heroic, and, above all, entertaining. This very derivative film features all the stock characters of a ""sword-and-sorcery"" story.

There's Grant Heslov, who, after ""True Lies"", once again pays a terrifically entertaining side-kick. Steven Brand is the worst-of-the-worst  bad guys. What fun! The sexual exploits are minimal, though suggestive. The body-count is quite high. The humor is everywhere, and The Rock commands attention and applause when he beats the bad guys.

A Knight's Tale is a film that successfully combines adventure, romance, drama, and comedy in a way that keeps you on the edge of your seat, wondering what will happen nextThe flaws in this film are somewhat obvious. First and foremost, it is not authentic. The storyline is set in medieval 13th century England. In the beginning of the film there is a jousting tournament, and the spectators are actually singing the words to &quot;We Will Rock You&quot;. That is not what I call authentic to a medieval 13th century England setting. Also, some of the dialogue is peppered with anachronistic idioms, and it seems that some of the characters are not as developed as others.It is still my opinion, however, that this film is very exciting to watch. Personally, I would classify it as a thriller, and the way in which the storyline blends adventure, romance, drama, and comedy makes up for the flaws.

706231,"I was overjoyed to learn that The Outer Limits was to join the ranks of classic TV shows currently receiving the DVD treatment, and even more enthusiastic to learn that MGM would release the set using a season format based on broadcast order. It is one of the great follies of the budding DVD age that The Twilight Zone has not received similar treatment by utilizing the storage capacity features of DVD. To say that the release of Rod Serling's sci-fi/fantasy masterpiece on DVD was done in a cumbersome, illogical fashion would be quite an understatement. Luckily, The Outer Limits avoids this travesty by offering the public a set encompassing the entire first season in original broadcast order. Despite frequent comparisons, I've always felt that The Outer Limits and The Twilight Zone were completely different types of shows. While the Twilight Zone asked viewers to imagine human beings visiting other planets, The Outer Limits required the viewer to imagine that these humans were already intricately involved in governmental plots with the planet's inhabitants designed to understand the behavioral patterns inherent in earth soldiers amidst planetary wars. The thematic structure of OL always asked more of the viewer than Zone did, in my opinion. Just a few thoughts to add regarding this box set, in light of the many well written Outer Limits reviews already present on amazon.com- I found the audio and visual dvd transfer to be very good, with a few minor exceptions/complaints. I felt that certain episodes displayed quite a bit of graininess in some scenes as well as noticeable light infraction during scenes utilizing deep darks, such as outer space scenes. Most notably were most of the scenes in ""The Man Who Was Never Born"", starring Martin Landau. For instance, during the scene in which the mutated Andro shows the space traveler the great library at the beginning of the episode, I observed the darkness of the library doors to be quite grainy and ""off-black"". I noticed quite a bit of grain present in much of the episode's other scenes involving dark backgrounds as well. Other episodes that I noticed this problem with included The Zanti Misfits (close-up ant scenes were very grainy), Nightmare (most of the very dark scenes were grainy) and Second Chance (scene where Empyrian is tackled to the floor by irate passenger was very grainy). I have videotaped episodes from the series when they aired on TNT Monster Vision back in the early 90s. After comparing the DVD to these VHS shows (which were showing their age), I concluded that this graininess was not present on the video taped shows. In fact, I would venture to guess that the overall visual quality of the show is slightly better on 1960s episodes currently being aired on the scifi channel than on the DVD set. To many viewers this graininess may be considered very minor, however, I was able to notice it without too much scrutiny. Other than these minor complaints, the visual transfer is quite good. Regarding the potential for the release of the 2nd season (which has not been confirmed by MGM yet), I think this future release is implied by the 1st season set, which is labeled ""Volume 1"". It would not make sense to indicate a volume number on the first season set if a subsequent edition was not in the works. Also, I do not think that MGM could have fit any bonus material into this set, considering the number of episodes presented here on a mere 4 discs. Hopefully, MFG will take advantage of the 17-episode second season by releasing bonus material in that set. One last comment- I noticed that another reviewer mentioned the first season soundtrack, which is available via CD on GNP/Crescendo records. I highly recommend this soundtrack to any Outer Limits fan who has found themselves enthralled by the exceptional orchestral work of Domonic Frontiere. Much like Bernard Herrmann's work for The Twilight Zone acted as an inseparable and essential aspect which made the show work, Frontiere's musical contributions to The Outer Limits were just as important as anything done by Leslie Stevens or Joe Stefano.","The Outer Limits - The Original Series, Season 1"

Now they could have been smart and think into the future and tried to complete the movie with look-alikes, but with the original script and characters, brought in Lee's top students like Dan Inosanto and Ted Wong and so on for second hand knowledge of Bruce's style. Later in the future, like now! They could use CGI or Computer Animation to complete it. This is not far fetched because George Lucas thought of computer technology in the future when he filmed STAR WARS in 1977! This movie came out in 1978.

520022,"When I saw the Lord of the Rings in the theater, I was dutifully impressed with the production quality and the adaption of what must truly be deemed a masterpiece of the twentieth century. I went into the extended version hoping that it would extend the vision, and I was not disappointed.From the beginning, the movie offers a much better explanation of hobbits, starting out with Bilbo writing about his adventures: ""There and Back Again: A Hobbits Tale."" The only shortcoming is the introduction, via knocks, of the Sackville Baggins does little beyond explaining why Bilbo was annoyed when Gandalf shows up. While this is not critical information to understand the stroy, it better sets up the ordinary life of Frodo, prior to taking on his perilous journey.As the adventure moves on, we see a much more plausible enactment of events in Bree, an extended look at the wilderlands leading up to Weathertop and greater character development of Aragorn (Strider), who will become pivotal in future movies.The scenes in Rivendell do greater justice to the setup of the Fellowship, which greatly adds to the epic. And, the Moria scenes are extended to give a much greater sense of the person of Gandalf and his sense of justice when it comes to Gollum.Of all the pieces added, none was more necessary to the epic at large than the wonder of Gimli over Galadriel. The gifting of the Fellowship, while not important for this movie, should play a much greater role as the epic rolls on this December.As for the extra material: For a true Tolkien fan, you really have to purchase both the extended version and the original release, as the material presented is different in each version. One of the nices pieces in this set is the notes on the locations that became different places in Middle Earth. While not technically superior, it is nice watching Jackson, and crew, scout out the locations that make New Zealand Middle Earth.As you peruse the DVD set, make sure to check out the easter egg included in the set. If you deride the set for not presenting a trailer of the next volume in this epic, you would do well to explore a bit before passing final judgement.",The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring

This a superb film, with Hopkins playing one of the leading roles in this saga, and space doesn't allow me the room to explain all the nuances.  Sufficient to say that embodies Tolstoy's ""Pierre.""

109220,"This quasi-remake of Hitchcock&#8217;s Dial M for Murder (1954)--which was filmed in 3D, by the way--is a rather good thriller in its own right, intelligently done throughout except for a few scenes near the end when Director Andrew Davis and screenwriter Patrick Smith Kelly lose their judgment and opt for a silly knock down, drag out fight.Michael Douglas plays a quintessential evil kind of guy, evil, ruthless, greedy, two-faced, crafted to excite our loathing (&#8220;How&#8217;s THIS for wet work?&#8221;).  He is excellent.  Gwyneth Paltrow plays his very rich wife who has incredibly poor taste in men.  Seems that Gwyneth has become attracted to roles that get her involved with the wrong kind of guys, witness The Talented Mr. Ripley (1999) and Sliding Doors (1998).  But she is also very good, as is Viggo Mortensen who plays the murderous con artist.The plot is tight and filled with nice twists.  The sets are opulent and dripping with money, and neither the direction nor the camera work calls undue attention to itself.  But what really makes this fly is the material on which it is based, the devilishly clever play by Frederick Knott, who reigned on Broadway many years ago.  I&#8217;ll bet that Paltrow was persuaded in part to take the role because the same part was played in the Hitchcock movie by the legendary Grace Kelly.  Also, another Frederick Knott play made into a movie was Wait Until Dark (1967) starring the also legendary Audrey Hepburn.  I suspect Paltrow could hardly resist joining such illustrious company, especially when the plot here allows her to take matters into her own hands, as it were, and give to her two guys considerably more than she gets.Bottom line: you will be diverted.",N/A
526086,"If you like golf, Savannah, movies set during the great Depression or sports in general, you'll like this movie.  Most comments on the Internet are negative, but I think they are from younger viewers looking for exploding heads and time-travel alien abductions and such.  Serious critics rated the movie a little better.  I found it entertaining.The film opens with a wealthy businessman from Savannah having passed away with large debts to many parties.  Several businessmen are hounding his daughter, Adel Invergordon (Charlize Theron), to sell them his assets on the cheap, including a golf course he owned.  Instead, to pay her father's debts, she decides to sponsor an exhibition golf between the two greatest golf player in the world, Bobby Jones (Joel Gretsch) and Walter Hagen (Bruce McGill.  She puts up all of her available cash, ten thousand dollars, as prize money.  The business and political leaders of Savannah do not think it would be good idea unless someone from Savannah was also in the exhibition.  The problem is they don't have anyone, that is, until someone remembers Rannulph Junuh (Matt Damon).Rannulph was a World War I vet from Savannah who came home from the war with post-traumatic stress syndrome.  Before the war he was a gifted, champion golfer.  Since then he's lost his swing, and now he's an unemployed drunk and card player.  It takes a lot of convincing to get Rannulph to join the exhibition.  I can't blame him since he'd be playing against the two best players in the world.  Out of nowhere, comes a man named Bagger Vance (Will Smith) offering to be his caddy for five dollars.  Bagger Vance is a mysterious, guardian angel type character.  When it comes to golf technique he's totally incompetent, but he's a great coach in the mental aspects of the game, as in self-confidence.  As you can imagine, the whole city of Savannah is rooting for Rannulph.  In times like this of economic disaster, people look for things to celebrate.The story is told through the eyes and memory of an elderly man named Hardy Greaves.  As a ten-year-old in Savannah, Hardy (J. Michael Montcrief) helps convince Rannulph to participate and is an assistant caddy to him.  Rannulph is his hope and his hero, and Hardy believes golf is the greatest thing in the world.  The core of the movie is the interaction among Rannulph, Hardy and Bagger.The movie has the cinematic air of A River Runs Through It, which Robert Redford also directed.  I mean that in a good way, although both movies occasionally flirt with a metaphysical silliness.  The cinematography is great.  The character Bagger Vance doesn't have enough characterization, and that's why the ending lacks sufficient oomph-just like A River Runs Through It lacked that oomph at the end also.  Bagger Vance lacks the mystery and power of other mystery men in movies, like John Coffey, in The Green Mile.  I like the actor Matt Damon, especially after seeing Good Will Hunting, but he looked too young for a burned out, drunken World War I vet in 1931, which is when the movie is set.  I'm being picky.  On the whole it's a nice movie.  It makes me wish I played golf and lived next to the golf course in Savannah.",N/A
586827,"This thriller is full of very strong performances.  Of very special note is Brittany Murphy.  On the DVD is Brittany Murphy's audition, which is nothing less than searing; some of the most powerful acting I have ever seen.  Even if you don't watch the movie, watch the audition.  The audition performance is considerably more intense than the same scene in the movie because it has no cuts, no breaks.  It is just one 5 minute long take.  It is like going 5 minutes without blinking.  Powerful stuff.  One can envision the producers getting the funding to complete the movie on the basis of this audition alone.Actually all the actors are very good, Michael Douglas, Famke Janssen, who plays Michael Douglas's wife and Skye McCole Bartusiak who is their daughter are all attractive and winning.  Skye McCole Bartusiak as the daughter deserves special note as she imbues that role with a sweet intelligence.  The good guys are attractive and we care about them.  Sean Bean, the bad guy, has a scary intensity sort similar to Robert Shaw of Jaws fame.The problem with Don't Say a Word is its plot.  Sean Bean's character is both a mad dog killer and a cool, calculating criminal mastermind.  On the one hand, Bean kills the one man who can tell him where to find what he is looking for ... on a subway platform in front of dozens of witnesses.  (Talk about a dumb move!)  On the other he plans a split-second bank heist of considerable complexity.  On the one hand he kills a kidnap victim while the ransomer (Oliver Platt) has yet to do what Bean wants.  (Bean was bored?  Didn't care?  Who knows?)  On the other he plots another complex kidnapping and manipulation of the Michael Douglas character.  Add this to other characters acting particularly stupid (Jennifer Esposito plays a cop who does not believe in calling for backup until it is too late for the backup to come in a timely manner/ do any good.) and the movie loses us as it piles improbability on improbability.  Too bad that all those fine performances don't add up to much.",N/A
317616,"This review's title is, sadly, true. The hopelessly aged Roger Moore pairs up with the second-worst Bond girl ever (Tanya Roberts, who does give ""Golden Gun's"" ""Mary Goodnight"" a serious run for her money as the worst...), and 80's icon Grace Jones, to give us Bond fans this: THE bad Bond movie to end all bad Bond movies.Sure, the action sequences (at least some) are very, very good. Also, this movie features Christopher Walken who, along with Diana Rigg, Judi Dench and Halle Berry, is one of the greatest actors to ever support Bond. Walken is maniacally interesting, although painfully under-developed as a character. This movie also features the legendary ""Avenger"" Patric Macnee (""John Steed""), as the obligatory ""sacrificial lamb"" a la ""From Russia's"" Kerim Bey. The present of John Steed notwithstanding, this movie is sunk from the get-go, and one figures that not even Emma Peel could save it...The movie starts out with a ridiculous sampling of The Beach Boys'""California Girl's"", while Bond beats the bad guys and boards a MI6 submarine decorated like a bachelor pad, complete with a bimbo-looking ""agent"". This scene is, to my mind, the absolute nadir of the Bond series: Roger Moore has finally done it, given a then-young Mike Myers the inspiration to spoof this legendary series and this legendary character. It doesn't get better, either. A San Francisco cop answers Moore's ""Bond. James Bond"" with ""Yeah, and I'm Dick Tracy!"" Unbelievable!!! The kitsch level is so insufferably high, and Moore's ridiculous un-Bondian mugging makes it all the more insufferably so. Of course, as this review's title indicates, the 60+ year old Bond gives us a whiff of domesticity, actually baking a quiche...!Thankfully, this would be Mr. Moore's final appearance as Bond. Thankfully, the under-appreciated Timothy Dalton would rescue this series from itself, and set up Pierce Brosnan's blockbuster performances as Bond...",N/A

As a longtime Juice fan I had never seen her live and was impressed by how beautiful she sounds live.  As her partner Otha Young says in the behind the scenes feature, Juice sounds even better live.  Her song selection is perfect, great new songs, and beautiful renditions of older hits.  I especially was touched by her rendition of ""Old Flame"".  What the dvd doesn't show is how Juice spent so much time and energy on her fans after the show signing autographs and talking.

497812,"Ridley Scott's &quot;Black Hawk Down&quot; begins ominously with the above quotation from Plato.It is Somalia, 1993 and President Clinton has ordered the US Rangers into Somalia to capture Aidid and his lieutenants who have thus far killed 300,000 of their own people; both by cold blooded murder and by starvation.The United States troops are so confident of a quick victory that they take only hand and automatic rifles and very little else to what was predicted to be a 45 minute skirmish which ended up being a 16 hour street war. The US are woefully under-weaponed and under-staffed as the Somalians proceed to fell 2 Black Hawk Heliocopters... hence the name of the film. The US troops underestimated the ferocity with which the rag-tag Somalians would defend their city and after approx 19 of our men are killed...we pulled out, retreated really from Somalia.This is the first of what I will call the &quot;Modern&quot; War films, in that Heliocopter video cameras catch all of the action while General William Garrison (Sam Shepard) calls the shots from a base outside of Mogadishu, based on these video pictures. He's a God-like figure manipulating fate from a place up high and removed from the action. It's like a real-life, real consequence PlayStation2 game. Heretofore, and think of any war film before this one, whether it be the Civil War, WWI,WWII, or Vietnam...war communication was conducted by hand messages, telephone, telegraph on maybe still pictures. &quot;Black Hawk Down&quot; begins the era of the new film war...the first real war film of the new Millenium.Even though Josh Hartnett is given top billing and he does a fine job, he is only part of a superb ensemble of which Eric Bana, Tom Sizemore, Ewan McGregor, William Fichter and Enrico Murciano are standouts.As with all Ridley Scott films the physical production is first rate: camerawork, use of color, sound and music are extrememly effective. The tone of &quot;Black Hawk Down&quot; is very much like &quot;Apocalypse Now&quot; in that both films have an over-riding sense of impending doom and futility.

Of course, I do own the soundtrack already, so that's more of a goodie than a must-have to me. But still, a cool goodie.The movie's good too, with a crisp, clear picture. The version I saw was widescreen -- my preference, personally. For those who have not seen the movie, it is based on the life of Mozart and his rivalry with the older, more staid Salieri (whose music you can still find). Costumes and sets are lush and evocative, the acting is divine, and the direction is incredible. This movie won a lot of awards back in its day, and for good reason. And in a cameo that just begs to be recognized, it has Vincent Schiavelli as a valet who thinks he knows how to get Salieri's attention in the first scene (he was the disgusting biology teacher in ""Fast Times at Ridgemont High"", and has had a host of other neat little roles).Between the exquisite quality of picture and the extras it includes, this is definitely a DVD I appreciate having.",N/A
232727,"First, let's state categorically that this movie has nothing to do with reality. It's inspired by, rather than a recounting of, the Battle of the Bulge. If you don't accept that premise, you will get so hung up on all the flaws, simplifications, and innacuaracies that you will never be able to enjoy it. And it can be enjoyed on a no-brainer level, simply as a good cartoon war movie. However, I can't state strongly enough that the standard VHS version of this movie has been edited down to the bare bones and is almost unwatchable. If you want to see the film as it was released in theatres in 1965, you have to catch it on television -- most stations broadcast the original version. There are about six important scenes missing from the VHS, most notably the whole battle of Ambleve, in which Bronson directs the defense against Shaw's panzers, and later faces down with him over rumors that he and the other American POW's may be executed. Nothing about this film is remotely realistic, especially compared to movies like &quot;A Bridge Too Far&quot;, &quot;Das Boot&quot; and &quot;Saving Private Ryan&quot; -- but it is interesting the moreso because when it was filmed (1965), Hollywood was still churning out this kind of romantic, ain't-war-heck pap....Vietnam not having added the cynicism we see in later movies like &quot;The Bridge At Remagen&quot; which was made just four years later, in 1969. &quot;Bulge&quot; is essentially a fairy tale about the real Battle, about which -- inexscusably -- no realistic movie has yet to be made.

255870,"The Abyss is James Cameron's weakest film.  However, Cameron should be proud that even his weakest film has plenty of merits, and its attempt at pulling off a global message is noble, even if it's a noble failure.This was one case where the &quot;director's cut&quot; phenomenon really proves unappetizing for the viewer.  There's a reason why the theatrical release version of this film was nearly a half hour shorter than this &quot;special edition&quot;, which is that the extra footage simply bogs down the momentum of the film, already quite languid to begin with.  The booklet to this DVD edition offers up an invaluable resource by describing exactly what differences exist from scene to scene between the special edition and the theatrical release, but nearly all of the arguments it offers for restoring the &quot;director's cut&quot; are unfounded.  Much of the restored footage is painstaking background detail and reiterations of concepts that already exist in the theatrical cut, and the badly written &quot;two candles&quot; scene features possibly the worst acting from Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio in the film.That said, even given the slow pacing, it's a tribute to Cameron's writing and directing abilities that the narrative thrust remains and you'd probably still be engaged throughout those long underwater-exploration scenes.  Michael Biehn, playing against type, does an excellent job portraying the detestable yet human Coffey; he makes life hell for everybody around him, yet Biehn and Cameron smartly instill the character with pathos.  Ed Harris is never less than compelling, and his unique, intimate charm carries the film.  Mastrantonio is the weak link in the cast -- she gets the hotheadedness and toughness of the character, but when trying to project the more vulnerable moments, her overacting grates on the nerves.  The photography and special effects are gorgeous (making it easy to see why it'd be tempting to restore the cut footage), and Alan Silvestri's score is fitting and elegant.  The central message is extremely preachy, but I still have to give it to Cameron for having attempted to convey it at all.  Few films and filmmakers have the daring to make such global, universal statements, and though Cameron was not able to seamlessly incorporate the message into the narrative of The Abyss, his attempt is admirable.  He would succeed in spades come time of Terminator 2:  Judgment Day.A flawed film, one which still warrants a serious look.",N/A
501597,"Nicholas Roeg's stylish thriller ""Don't Look Now"" is made with such nerve-jangling invention it's guaranteed not to look or move like anyone else's work. From start to finish it's an original, so marvelously textured and polished, you want all the artful technique to have a point beyond the penny-dreadful purpose underlying it.A former cinematographer, Roeg's movies are almost compulsively ""visual,"" all angle, light, color, texture and editing. One bravura sequence follows another: the opening drowning of Christie and Sutherland's daughter; their famous tussle together in bed; Sutherland's nearly fatal accident as he examines a decaying mosaic, all shot and cut in quick, impressionistic fragments, interwoven and juxtaposed with silky fluency. And the pleasures aren't purely technical, with plenty of wry touches at the edges: the obsequious behavior of the Italian hotel clerk where Christie and Sutherland are staying, for example, or the barely concealed eagerness with which the masters of an English school shepherd a nervous Christie out of their house.It's all wonderfully sophisticated and understated. When wed to the conventional thriller requirements of ""Don't Look Now,"" though, this floating, languorous anxiety seems just a tad too self-consciously pretty to be entirely appropriate. The atmosphere of everyday dread resulting from Roeg's touches works, all right, but it borders on the insulting to have so much skill lavished on such trashy material. This is a story, after all, that requires we believe in warnings from the Great Beyond, that invites Blind Faith as a form of therapy and that posits the possibility not just of precognition, but preternatural insight thousands of miles from the event.Paramount has done an uncharacteristically good job of serving the movie in the DVD. In fact, the transfer is perhaps a touch *too* good. Images nearly unintelligible in projection here have a vivid presence that both works for and against the thriller premise. With so much more visible, the sense of rot and decay is almost palpable. On the other hand, sequences that rely on the darkness tend to get blunted a bit when everything is out in the open to be seen.Which is perhaps another way of saying that the disc's producers responded to what gives the movie its distinction, the sexy, sensuous surfaces, rather than the Gothic horror that are their excuse.",Don't Look Now VHS

Near a drink machine, Miaka witnesses a beautiful red bird fly up the stairs and into a dark room of rare books reserved for staff only.Miaka and Yui go into the room, where they discover an ancient Chinese book called ""The Universe of the Four Gods"". Yui, who could read the language, opens the book with Miaka and begins to read..'This is the story of a girl who made her dreams come true after she came to possess the seven stars of Suzaku, and many powers were bestowed upon her. The story itself is a spell. The one who reads it through will be given the powers and granted a wish like the girl in the story. Because... the story begins and becomes real...

14452,"Controversial movies like this always result in a lot of contradictory feedbacks. After reading all other viewers' comments, I just want to add a few things. 1. If you label this movie as a ""porn"" or ""soft porn"", you may never have watched a ""real"" porn flick, or you must have missed one topnotch line in the ""porn film shooting"" scene of this movie, a line that defined so well the difference between erotic and pornographic cinema (a crew member asked the director, ""so where's the come shot? I thought we were doing ""Body Talk"", not ""Last Tango"".)  2. It's quite unfair to blame Brian de Palma for ""borrowing"" Hitchcock's ideas from ""Vertigo"" or ""Rear Window"". Because if that's true, Hitchcock would have been pleased to see his ideas beautifully revived and enhanced in this very entertaining thriller. Over the years, I personally don't find all Hitchcock films as enjoyable as they used to be, while some of Brian de Palma tend to become classics themselves. There's something to make me think of Hitchcock though: Twenty-one years after Tippi Hedren gave a pretty nice performance in ""The Birds"" (1963), her daughter Melanie Griffith really delivered a much better one in ""Body Double"" (1984).",N/A

72013,"This adaptation of the gritty bestseller is a real find.  In it we have Christian Bale as `psycho' of the title Patrick Bateman, spurred into action through a boring 80's lifestyle of business and appearances.  By focusing on middle-class society's little nuances, this movie manages to show just how complacent society has become, with Bale's lifestyle of a perfectly astute businessman masking his other life as a murderer who hires prostitutes up to his trendy flat.The performances are all good but it is Bale who impresses the most as he calmly murders a colleague yet becomes pent-up with rage when someone has a more expensive-looking business card than his own.  The audience sits back and watches as the beautiful ensemble cast (including Chloe Sevigny, Reese Witherspoon and Jared Leto) are lured or skewered by Bateman.  This is black comedy at its very blackest, forcing its audience into nervous titters as Bateman moonwalks behind one of his victims, wielding an axe, or prepares for a murder whilst listening to Whitney Houston.It's not only a darkly humorous piece but it also says a lot about society today, despite being set two decades ago.  Moreover it's a definite improvement on the book, toning down the violence to make it a lot more comic and a little less horrific but not to the extent that the message doesn't come across loud and clear.",American Psycho VHS

289881,"""The Ark in Space"" is one of those titles DVD-enthusiastic fans saw coming a long, long way away. It was one of the first videos, one of only a handful of stories released on laserdisc, and maintains a consistent popularity that regularly puts it at the top of the list when people think of ""great Tom Baker stories"", or even great Doctor Who in general. I know several fans - myself included - who had actively expected either ""Ark"" or ""Pyramids of Mars"" to start off the post-""Five Doctors"" range of DVDs, and were disappointed by the choice of ""The Robots of Death""; I'm happy to say, however, that it was well worth the wait.I was quite taken aback by the video element of ""The Ark in Space"". Although the actual quality is probably no better than that of ""Robots"", there is no irritating jitter to one side of the screen, and the colors seem - well, more vibrant, somehow. I was quite taken aback by the video element of ""The Ark in Space"". Although the actual quality is probably no better than that of ""Robots"", there is no irritating jitter to one side of the screen, and the colors seem - well, more vibrant, somehow. This is something I clearly noticed on all the previous releases except ""Robots"", so I am definitely happy to report that the Tom Baker stories have just as good a chance as any to look alive and fresh on DVD.Most publicized amongst the extra features are the new CGI model effects. You have the menu option to either watch the story with the original model effects from 1975, or see the new ones integrated throughout. Personally, I would go for the former option Here's what bothered me about the new CGI: while the medium and long shots of Nerva Beacon are undeniably gorgeous and very atmospheric, any time the Ark passes directly in front of the camera - the two prime examples are in Part 1 - my disbelief was instantly shattered. It is clearly a computer-generated model, and looks very fake that close to the viewer, without any shadows to hide it. While the original 1975 model shots are hokey, and a touch embarrassing, I am at least used to them - so I'll continue watching the story that way.The DVD also contains a number of other extras, ranging from the excellent - a 1975 interview with Tom Baker, a 2001 interview with designer Roger Murray-Leach, and an brilliant production trivia subtitle track, to the ridiculous - a new CGI ""space station schematic feature"", and the mind-numbing Howard Da Silva PBS voiceovers. Most of the extras, including a commentary with Tom Baker, Lis Sladen and producer Philip Hinchcliffe, a reconstructed trailer, cast biographies and a photo gallery, fall somewhere in the middle - worth watching once, anyway.For all my criticisms, ""The Ark in Space"" is a must-have Doctor Who DVD. Sure, several of the extras are lightweight, but what good ones there are prove very, very good, and the story is of a very high caliber to begin with. Plus, who knows, maybe you'll like those CGI effects more than I did!",Doctor Who - The Ark in Space VHS

The movie started and I could not take my eyes off it. The star, Audrey Tautou, is absolutely stunning. Her mixture of beauty, brains, and bashfulness make her perfect for the role.

The story was kind of slow, but it kept me their the whole time. I never turned the DVD off once...I couldn't believe it. I thought Jennifer was great in this movie. Not to mention great looking.

426885,"I saw the film the week it opened back in 1996 and just bought the DVD. But I must say: If this film irked you, you should've seen the stage show, which was even more brittle and astringent with its completely *unsympathetic* portrayal of Sra. Peron. One masterstroke is that the film sets out to give Eva more sympathy than the play did (never mind that she ultimately remained an enigma; that was the case of the actual woman also). But the film makes some important alterations throughout the story. In the stage show Eva uses, then throws over, Magaldi. This is reversed in the film, with Magaldi leaving her at his door (making her a kind of spurned victim) which ultimately leads to the spotlight torch song ""Another Suitcase In Another Hall"" (sung on stage, by the way, by a background character). Later, when she sings ""You Must Love Me,"" she is further softening the Evita character. (The lyrics illustrate the couple's marriage of convenience and how now that they're coming to the end, maybe there's love in their union after all.) But many scenes- several of Madonna's songs, *all* of Banderas's - are quite impressive. And the scene on the balcony (the ""Casa Rosada""), is worth the price of the DVD, just to hear the chant of ""Peron! Peron!"" change over to ""Evii-ta! Evii-ta!""",N/A

539636,"Those kids from Good Will Hunting are really growing up.  Now that they have grown up they want to go from the cerebral to the action oriented in one bound.  Right now you could go to the theater and find  Ben Affleck playing a C.I.A. Analyst in The Sum of All Fears or you could check out the adaptation of Robert Ludlum's The Bourne Identity with Matt Damon as the lead.  I can't speak for the latter but you might want to wait and rent this one.Matt Damon plays the title role of Jason Borne.  Borne has a lot of special talents unfortunately he has to learn about them one at a time because, well, he has lost his memory.  It seems that he was pulled out of the ocean with two bullets in him as well as a nice little micro-chip.  The men on this ship thought he was dead but much to their surprise he is still alive and after some quick surgery, healing rather rapidly.  He doesn't know who he is or how he came to be in the ocean.  He does know that he seems to speak multiple languages fluently and that this chip is leading him to an address of a bank in Zurich.After getting to this bank, the man discovers that he appears to have multiple identities of which Jason Borne seems the most comfortable.  He also has quite a bit of cash, some weapons, and after being attacked...a good deal of fighting skills he was unaware of possessing.  Borne is forced on the run to discover his identity.  Unfortunately the longer he is on the run, the more people with similar skills pop up trying to kill him.  It seems that a major governmental agency is not happy having supposedly dead agents reappear without contacting them.First off  I must admit that I have never read the original book so I cannot comment as to how accurate an adaptation this movie is.  That being said, I will state this is a very uneven movie.  The action sequences are first rate and engrossing.  The speed of them can keep you riveted on the edge of your seat.  That's the good news.The bad news is that the rest of the movie moves as a snails pace and doesn't sustain the suspense in the slightest.  If anything the middle sequences slow the movie considerably.  Also, the movie doesn't seem to go anywhere.  The beginning makes some sense for story purposes but the end just happens with no particular climactic moment.  One minute the movie is going along and the next...it just stops dead in its tracks.  It almost leaves you wanting more with the earnest hope that something else will happen to explain the movie.Matt Damon does do a good job in the title role.  He is very believable as someone who has lost all touch with himself and suddenly finds people all converging with his face in their scope.  He is pretty phenomenal in the action sequences and they were quite surprising in their ferocity.  This movie is full of action but make no mistake, it is definitely PG-13 oriented as most of it is bloodless.Most of the rest of the actors have meaningless characters and could have been done by anyone.  Character actor Chris Cooper, Lone Star and The Patriot, is wasted as the ""villain"" and Julia Stiles, Save the Last Dance, is almost non-existent in her role.Did I hate the movie?  Not particularly but I was not totally entertained.  It had some great moments but they were few and far between.",N/A

This is truly one of the most transgressive horror films ever made and, surprisingly, I found it to be a far more coherent and intelligent film than I had ever imagined.  The DVD transfer is excellent, and I find myself constantly impressed by American DVD companies, who go out of their way to find relevant interviews and extras to go with the movie.

536664,"I loved the first in the series, so eagerly awaited this one, and went, yeah, well...not as good.And in many ways it is not, the quiet character development that so was so charming in the first one is rather pushed aside in this head long rush into a pace that never stops for breath.  You are nearly exhausted by the end!!However, after the initial grump about it not being as good, I have since viewed it several times.  And the more I view it the more I like it.  The humour is there, brilliantly delivered by Brandon Fraser, like after rescuing his wife from being killed by the resurrected mummy, they are escaping and she pauses to pull a bench to block a door, and he gently said in his typically comic Brandon voice, ""Honey, what are you doing? Those guys don't use doors.""  The kid is precious without being TOO CUTE.  Especially fun is his interplay with his kidnappers - ala Ransom of Red Chief, bugging them with ""are we there yet?"" so typically bored kid!!  Also, with the female captor when she tells him to behave and he replies, ""I don't behave for my parents, so what make you think I will for you?""You get eye candy in the female fight scenes, wonderfully staged.

724371,"Undercover Brother, the super-spy borne from an Internet cartoon, is a paradox, in a productive way.  A funky brother in a decidedly unfunky time, he'd seem to be the perfect person to inject soul into a soulless age.  But alas, ""Undercover Brother"", the movie borne from the Internet cartoon, is also a paradox, but in a more destructive way.  It's also a very hypocritical film.Right off the top, the film makes a point of denigrating the mistakes of recent black pop culture icons (Urkel, Rodman, etc.).  I had high hopes for the inherent cleverness of its premise -- that said mistakes were perpetrated by a vast conspiracy to keep the funky black man down -- but the film goes on to reveal a host of characters that revel in those self same mistakes.  Dave Chappelle's 'Conspiracy Brother' character, while providing most of the film's obvious laughs, is the kind of undignified manic clown that the film is railing against.  Chi McBride's 'The Chief' is supposed to be a parody of a cliche (the gruff, always yelling, tough talking chief with a heart of gold), but it doesn't tear down the layers of this kind of character enough to make the point tangible and relevant.The menace of 'The Man', a literal representation of that oft-mentioned vast conspiracy, while surely meant to be cartoonish should at least have been slightly real.  We never see The Man's face, only a darkened silhouette.  Fine.  But his island fortress is more Dr. Evil than Dr. No (come to think of it, much of this movie feels like a pale ""Austin Powers"" knock-off).  And his main henchman Mr. Feather, a role that could have been a golden opportunity to give a serious or burly actor a ridiculously comic part, is wasted by casting Chris Kattan.  Kattan does little more than mug his way through the part (sadly, Kattan's isn't even the worst performance here; Denise Richards proves once again that unless she's playing the object of desire, she's useless).  At several points he's supposed to show how Feather, an unabashed white supremacist, is a slave to the rhythm whenever a funky musical groove is played.  Only Kattan can't find the beat with a flashlight and a metronome.  And can you imagine the terror Undercover Brother must feel when confronted by his arch-nemesis, and said arch-nemesis is 5'5"" and weighs 120 lbs soaking wet?  That's right: there is none.  I know, the incongruence of all this is supposed to be broad and jokey.  But it sure isn't funny.Many of the film's jokes can be seen coming a mile away.  And when they can't, the filmmakers, who appear to have little respect for the intelligence of their audience, give a wink-wink visual explanation that wrings all semblance of humour from the proceedings.  One such moment has The Chief lamenting that he's, ""Too old for this s--t.""  In case you didn't get the obvious reference, he casts a knowing look on a picture of Danny Glover hanging on the wall behind him.  Ugh!  Mostly, the film can't decide if it's going to be an ""Airplane""-style absurdist parody, or a ""Saturday Night Live""-style slapstick romp.  This lack of commitment dulls the comedy greatly.Eddie Griffin, a comic-actor who can be supremely appealing when his grating charisma is toned down, isn't nearly as manic as he could have been.  But he's also nowhere near as funny.  Griffin, whose absurd improvisations nearly made ""Deuce Bigalow: Male Gigolo"" watchable, is kept on a leash so tight that he's in danger of asphyxiating.  He tries his best to get mileage out of his enormous afro and retro clothing by flashing a big bright smile and busting a hip dance move every chance he gets, but he comes off more as a straight man than the riotous comic creation that this movie needs at its centre.  Without it, the rest just falls flat.Director Malcolm D. Lee gets in some retributive jabs on behalf of his brother Spike, and in the beginning it appears that he has created an interesting and energetic way of telling the story.  But the film feels sloppily put together.  Scenes end without rhyme or reason, and start up again without any sense of context.  During the climactic battle, when two or three plotlines are happening at once, the audience becomes confused and lost in the action.  Where Lee does shine is in his choice of music, assembling a super-funky soundtrack that cobbles together the greatest hits of The Commodores ('Brick House'), Wild Cherry ('Play That Funky Music'), James Brown ('Say It Loud (I'm Black And I'm Proud)') and, most pleasingly but somewhat out of place, Gil Scott-Heron ('The Revolution Will Not Be Televised').  Parliament's 'Give Up The Funk (Tear The Roof Off The Sucker)' scores Undercover Brother's intro with perfect panache.  And the song used for the opening credits appears to be a well-conceived in-joke: 'Pick Up The Pieces' by the, ahem, Average White Band.I have to give the film credit; it does have its moments.  I caught myself laughing at a scene where Undercover Brother and two goons stop fighting, make themselves some snacks and sodas, and pull up a couple of chairs, when they realize that a cat fight has broken out between Denise Richards and Aunjanue Ellis' Sistah Girl.  But the film is ultimately a failure because its premise, with so much potential for ripe parody and biting satire, is squandered at nearly every turn.  ""Undercover Brother"" wants to uncover some relevant social issues with hip comedy.  Instead, it covers them up with a wet blanket.",N/A

384868,"I bought this recently wondering if the fun would still be there after a few decades.  Sometimes things have to be rethought, updated.  ""Dick and Jane"" still works all by itself.  We might be conditioned to think of Jane Fonda for her dramatic roles, but she is a superior comedian and does a superb job as Jane.I consider it one of the top movies of all time -- but many people need weight and heft before they will stake any such claim.  If you are one of those, I'm sorry.  I will always love this film.If anyone knows how to campaign for a DVD version, let us know.  A few other reviewers have asked for a DVD version, I see.One reason I wanted to write this review is that I recently saw ""The Morning After"" and was surprised that my opinion was so different than most reviews I researched.  This is a fine look at Jane Fonda's ability by Sidney Lumet.  I think a lot of people misunderstand what they are seeing, however.  If you don't ""get it"" you might not appreciate the brilliance of this performance:  we don't know who Fonda is portraying for most of the movie.  Seeing an actor is most often like receiving a specially prepared gift.  The actor's work ususally supplies a lot of ""givens"" to the developing story.  Not the case in ""The Morning After.""  Here, we are challenged rather than coddled to.  Only near the end do we find that the character's history includes more than the status of a ""ne'er-been"" TV walk-on actress.I was will be thinking about this movie for days and watching it again.  And watching ""Fun with Dick and Jane"" more, too.  Both of these films should make you proud of a job well done by Jane Fonda.",Fun with Dick and Jane VHS

This is a fool's enterprise, so I will restrain myself.Nothing can compare to the pageantry, majesty, spray of colors, and epic emotion of this film.  You have the perfect stets, and the occasional on locations shot in Goshen and Sinai.  I think he only place where this film breaks down is in the special effects. For the rod-to-serpent sequence and the depictions of Jehovah, they used animation, which I guess was the state of the art at the time. But I think that all of these are forgivable when we look at the still spectacular parting of the red sea.  That is one scene and effect that still stands, and withstands, the test of time.At the heart of this story is a man who was given a charge from God to liberate his people.  I think that in a sense we are all Moses, if we would really pay attention to what is going on.  We all can be leaders.  Not that we hold office, or turn water to blood, but that we bring other people to the truth, and bring others out of captivity.The introduction by Cecil B. DeMille indicates that he made this film as an anti-communist tract and argument, with Moses being the force for freedom, or an ancient George Washington, and Pharaoh being the chain of captivity, or a stone age Stalin.  I guess there was a little bit more going on in 1950's Hollywood than blacklisting and McCarthyism.Nowadays, I would imagine that we would focus on the Golden Calf incident.  Washington and Lincoln gave us freedom, but now what do we do? Do we worship Golden Calves (or Gold and Calves?) or do we get freedom in God's law.  We are free in the United States, but all we do is watch reruns on TV.Heston's acting performance needs no comment.  He is the definitive Moses, and I wonder if we ever actually met Moses if we would be let down!  However, I must congratulate DeMille on casting Yule Brenner as Pharaoh. The normal game is to have a strong hero and a weak villain, but when you have two strong actors opposing each other, they are able to play off of each other's strength to give a magnificent performance.  That is why ""Silence of the Lambs"" worked so well: both Anthony Hopkins and Jodi Foster are top par actors. The film would be half as good if there either Lecter or Starling were played by weak actors.The DVD has the standards, but no commentary, nor deleted scenes. But it does have three of the trailers. The original trailer is a ten-minute affair that serves more as a behind the scenes clip than a trailer.  It has DeMille discussing some aspects of the film, shows a picture with Heston looking at Michelangelo's famous sculpture with an uncanny resemblance between the two being apparent, and informs us that the prop stone tables used in the film were actually cut from Sinai stone.  I wonder where they are now.This movie is worth your money, if the normal slush of sub-standard cinema bores you.  At 220 minutes, it is a long film. I broke the film up into three parts. I saw the first half of disc up to chapter fourteen one on one day, the second half on another day, and the third disc on the third day.  With such a deep and meaningful film, I think it is too much to cram in one film fest.This film appeals not only to the mind, and the heart, but also to the soul.  When is the last time you could say that about a film?",N/A
677839,"I normally despise westerns because of their indifference toward plot and the dull ways they present development. More often than not, there is a definitive lesson to be learned from the one or two &quot;good guys&quot; of the film, and the &quot;trials and tribulations&quot; faced aren't that harsh at all. There may be loss and suffering, but it isn't truly loss or suffering. Its normally just padder. Well, that all changes when Lucio, who seems to thrive on tormenting his main characters, picks up where most Westerns leave off.I was impressed by the uniqueness of some of the characters he presents as well as the way that Lucio opens the floodgates for the characters to experience. For starters, there's a versatile villain to keep up with, one that introduces himself in a rather helpful way before going into his more sadistic, more enjoyably graphic, truths behind the &quot;good guy&quot; mask. There's also one of the main four, a black gentleman that sees and speaks to the dead, that seems rather off the chart for most frontier movies, and that's just the beginning. Also, while traveling along the way, there are other odds and ends characters add to the story being woven.This, added to the fact that the movie didn't succumb to the &quot;be a Western&quot; pressures made it much more than watchable. It made me want to get a good friend like Chaco on DVD, too.",Four of the Apocalypse

Humphrey Bogart is dashing as club owner Rick Blaine and Ingrid Bergman is luminous as his former paramour Ilsa Lund who comes back into his life with her husband Victor Laslzo played by Paul Henreid.

I can easily see there being a couple more sequels in the series, and just as Sean Connery will forever be associated with James Bond and Harrison Ford with Indiana Jones, so will Snipes be with his creature of the night, Blade. He plays the part perfectly; it's one of those things you just sort of take for granted and don't really think about, but if you do happen to ponder who else would be able to play the role, I don't think you'd be able to think of anyone else. He puts more emotion into Blade in this movie than he did in the first one here he displays his hatred of the Bloodpack, his martial arts skills, and his romantic side In fact this is one of those movies where you really believe the cast are vampiresIf there is going to be another installment in the series, I sure hope it comes soon.I really don't want to have to wait another four years for it",Blade 2 VHS
371555,"For this 1948 film Ronald Colman, one of the finest actors ever to grace the silver screen, finally got the recognition he long deserved in the form of his first Oscar. In this absorbing, psychological thriller, Colman gave the performance that won the Academy Award for Best Actor.Playing the role of revered stage actor, Anthony John, Colman gives an intense and riveting performance. When the obsessive Anthony John is called to play the role of Othello, he agrees to do so, and his ex wife and love of his life, Brita Kaurin (Signe Hasse) agrees to play the role of Desdemona. All goes well, and the play is a smashing, long running Broadway success.Playing the role of Othello for such a protracted period of time, however, begins to wreak havoc with John's sanity, as reality and fantasy collide. Brita is seeing someone else in real life, and John, still in love with her, begins to confuse reality with his role. This spills over into his acting, and his acting spills over into his real life. This double life leads to catastrophic consequences from which there is no turning back. Those cognoscenti viewers familiar with the role of Othello can well imagine where this may lead, given the personal dynamics outlined.All in all, terrific performances are given by the entire cast. Ronald Colman is magnificent in the part of the conflicted Anthony John, and Signe Hasso does herself proud in the role of John's ex-wife. Look for a young and buxom Shelley Winters in a small, but pivotal, role. The incisive screenplay, written by Ruth Gordon and Garson Kanin, makes for a drama that is redolent of the New York theatre. Well directed by George Cukor, this is a film that fans of the velvet voiced Ronald Colman will love, as will all those who enjoy a well acted drama.","Double Life, A VHS"
11195,"This quietly riveting, intellectually stimulating masterpiece of erotic drama put the now famous director Steven Soderbergh on the Hollywood map. Rightfully so, as it's four central characters pull you into an intriguing plotline filled with just what the appropriate title has promised.John, played by uni-brow actor Peter Gallagher in a low-brow performance, is a career minded, self-centered lawyer married to uptight southern girl Ann (Andie MacDowell). Ann has a flaky and sexually liberated sister named Cynthia, ""Just Shoot Me"" alum Laura San Giacomo. What Ann DOESN'T know, is how she is being mocked and scorned by both her husband, and her sister as they secretly meet for torrid, forbidden sexual encounters. Cynthia takes a perverse pleasure in this duplicity, especially in her sisters bed.  The disregard these two have for those who are affected by their affair is shamelessly cruel.  I really dislike Gallagher's John, which means he plays his role well.The games begin when Graham, an old collegiate buddy of John's, comes to town for a visit. Graham is wonderfully played by the incredible James Spader, a personal favorite of mine. Graham has a bit of a problem though, he's impotent.  (Now, I must say, Spader playing an impotent character is a bit of a reach, but I'm not complaining!)  The only way he can be gratified sexually, is by videotaping women talking about their personal sexual experiences, hence the third item in the film title.As I said, the movie is quietly fascinating. One of the oddest things about it, is the complete LACK of any sort of musical score within. It seems to draw you into the plot even more, since there's little else to distract ones attention.I like Spader's character the best, not just because I'm partial to the actor, but because he played the most complex and interesting character. He is also at his sexiest here, all dressed in black shirt, jeans, and his blonde hair longish and VERY sexy. His impotence in the movie, is like a companion to Andie MacDowell's Ann characters frigidity. Together, they find a way to overcome the deceit around them.This is an unusual film, controversial in its time, but rather tame by todays standard fare. It's a good choice when you're in the mood for a little food for thought, or a quiet relaxing movie experience. I say this because you have to be in the mood for this sort of film. Save it for your quietest moment when you can fully appreciate it.",N/A
693690,"Following on from the disappointing and deservedly critically mauled Phantom Menace (great title awful movie) comes Attack of the Clones, lumbered with the weight of expectation of many millions of Star Wars fans who felt cheated by episode I and the baggage of having a c**p title. However, Star fans need have no fear, although not the best in this popular series of movies, it is in many departments up there with episodes IV and V levels and definitely superior to both episodes I and VI. All that said, Attack of the Clones is still a good news/bad news affair...although the good heavenly outweighs the bad.The bad news is that Jar Jar Binks makes an unwelcome return. Perhaps this is a somewhat muted response and stubborn refusal by George Lucas to concede that Jar Jar is the greatest mistake of the Star Wars franchise, or perhaps it is just an attempt to shift millions of unsold and unwanted Jar Jar merchandise left over from The Phantom Menace. We may never know but mercifully Monsieur Binks appears relatively briefly on this occasion, with just enough screen time to plunge the republic headlong toward disaster, in his new role as a speaker in the senate. Also on the disappointing side is the length of the movie, coming in at a mighty 142 minutes despite apparently having many deleted scenes (apparently set to appear on the DVD as extras). When will filmmakers learn the old adage that less is sometimes more? Several of the scenes were somewhat unnecessary, with the Droid factory scene being more akin to a computer game (such as Abe's Odyssey) than a movie. The Jedi lurve scenes are also substantially overplayed and in traditional Lucas style much of the dialogue is more than a little clunky and given to clich&eacute; and alas, much like The Phantom Menace, there is also way too much CGI. However there is much to be thankful for in episode II...The really really good news is that Episode II delivers in a very big way with more than 100 jawdropping action set pieces, created masterfully by ILM. Lance Christiansen as Anakin Skywalker is well cast and he perfectly captures the conflict of good and evil as the great hero destined to become the greatest villain in cinematic history. Ewan MacGregor and Samuel L. Jackson, as Obi Wan and Mace Windu are also given much bigger roles with the opportunity to flex their lightsaber wielding muscles in some juicy action scenes. There are also the additions of some great villains in the shape of Count Dooku (Christopher Lee) and Jango Fett (Temeura Morrison). Christopher Lee is in particular a fantastic addition to the Star Wars cast, bringing the same credibility and intelligence to the movie as he and Ian MacKellen added to Lord of the Rings. There is also a welcome return to the darker tones of The Empire Strikes Back (perhaps this franchises greatest hour), with Anakin wreaking revenge upon a whole village of Tuskin Raiders, women and children `n all in revenge for the death of his mother. However, there is still room for some dry humour with the best lines being saved for Ewan MacGregor as Obi-Wan. ""Why do I get the feeling that you're going to be the death of me?"" asks Kenobi of his young prot&eacute;g&eacute;.Although many critics will argue that in George Lucas's world CGI action and effects take precedence over dialogue and character development, most fans will resoundingly reply ""we don't care"", for Attack of the Clones is an enormous improvement on the cartoon-like childrens movie that was The Phantom Menace and for this we should be very thankful. Episode II is indeed very much a return to form; always entertaining and a great cinematic spectacle, which leaves the franchise in good health as we eagerly await the all-important episode III and the impending victory of the dark side of the force. And whilst I still cant quite totally forgive Mr Lucas for his previous indiscretion, he has given us a new hope.",N/A
713802,Jason X is no work of art that's for sure. The basic stalk 'n' slash formula is loud and clear but this time round there is so much more color and invention that provides decent distraction whenever big J isn't onscreen doing his murdering thingy.The idea of setting it in space is sure odd but Crystal Lake was seriously overdone and although it seems very eccentric Jason seems to fit in with the spaceship location. As long as there are enough people for him to slaughter anyway.It may lack the menace and dread of the previous films but at least it has a credible sense of humor and touch of irony. This film does a good job of re-inroducing Jason to a 21st century audience. And we will be getting even more of him soon when Freddy vs Jason is released next year.The direction and imagination in previous installments were pretty amatuer but Jim Issac proves he's got some skill in this 'un. The SFX are flawless and the digital quality of the film really gives a futuristic sparkle. Which is well represented on the DVD.New Line put Paramount to shame with this DVD.

148827,"It took me three sittings to sit through most of Navy Seals, and I still dozed off through a few minutes of it.  Yes, boredum the movie's biggest problem.  This is by far the dullest action movie I've seen in years, maybe even of all-time.What's the plot?  Who cares?  It's just bare bones enough to string up some action sequences, but unfortunately, the action scenes smell of made-for-TV quality.  Heck, some of the stuff that's made-for-TV these days features better action (i.e. Band of Brothers).  Director Lewis Teague obviously doesn't know much more than the good old point-and-shoot method, meaning he's got no style or, for that matter, a sense of direction.  People shoot, get shot, and it's a basic, routine pattern that continues for all the gunfights.  There are no cool stunts, outrageous situations, or edgy tension during all these scenes.The way it is for me is that movies involving commando teams are rarely ever exciting, mainly because it's a bunch of tough guys who seem invincible, even when a couple of them get killed.  Oh, don't get me wrong, there are notable exceptions (such as the nail-biter Executive Decision), but Navy Seals sure isn't one of them.  The film never builds up any suspense because the villains never seem like a threat.  None of the bad guys are even the slightest bit menacing.  Already, at least half the movie's effectiveness is gone.But the ""heroes"" are just as lame and uninteresting.  For these parts, acting's what you'd expect.  Charlie Sheen plays himself, annoying and idiotic as usual.  Michael Biehn is the tough-as-nails commander, a role he can do in his sleep, though he plays the part so straight he might just induce some sleep in the viewers.  Nobody else makes an impression, not even the usually funny Bill Paxton.I don't have much more to say about Navy Seals, other than its third-rate, silly crap that fails on every intended level.  It's dull plot and premise won't make this an enjoyable movie to trash in a crowd, and its boring execution will put a lot of viewers to sleep.

It is a silly horror/comedy type B movie that became the meat and potatoes of so many early studios. I love it. Jack Haley is Albert Tuttle a nose to the grindstone insurance man who has an appointment with an old rich recluse. He arrives at his mansion and is seen in by the butler (Bela Lugosi). He is shown into his clients office and immediately starts his spiel to the back of a chair and smoke coming from a lit cigar. However, unbeknownst to Tuttle the client is dead and in his coffin in the office. Tuttle lays his brief case on the closed coffin before he realizes just what is in the room. When he does try to get out, he can't open the door, etc. This movie is filled with every conceivable cliche imaginable. But that's the fun of it. A huge dark creepy house, a will to be read, a suspicious looking butler and cook, a beautiful damsel in distress, a dim witted detective, a houseful of greedy family members of the deceased, murders, trick doors, screams and noises at night, etc. Of course, a very nervous and reluctant hero.

Avery Brooks (In 1994) is acting with William Shatner (In 1966) and never ever having been on the same set and over 30 years apart.The story in this episode is simple but effective, but the details in recreating the original Eneterprise sets, cistumes, props and even the Model itself was expertly done. (Probably better then they did it back int he 60's!) I got to believe the cast and crew had a great time on this one.This is a must for every Star Trek fan - even if you did not like Deep Space Nine overall. It was my least favorite of the Star Trek incarnations - a little too dark for me. But watching Odo, Work, Kira and especially Dax interact with the oridinal Star Trek series crew is well worth it.Bravo! - Buy this and watch it with the original series episode &quot;Trouble With The Tribbles&quot; and see technologically and creative film-making at its best!","Star Trek - Deep Space Nine, Episode 103: Trials and Tribble-ations VHS"
245870,"Actually not a bad martial arts movie. sure it is simple, but that is not a bad thing in this case. Rather than a contrived and cliched plot, this movie (based on the real experience of Frank Dux) displays different forms of martial arts through the brutal kumite (similar to shoot fights or UFC). The sub-story of two US government officials chasing after Frank is fairly pointless and doesn't add anything to the story (and neither does the ""love"" interest), but overall a good display of different martial art styles.",Bloodsport VHS
547549,"THE PRIME MOVER from the Second season aired on March 24, 1961 and was written by Charles Beaumont and is an episode that deserves repeated viewing. Dane Clark and Buddy Ebsen operate a small diner. When Clark discovers that Ebsen has telekinetic powers he drags him off to Vegas to make a killing at the casinos. This is a good-natured episode as opposed to THE FEVER on the allure and pitfalls of gambling. What really makes this episode so repeatedly viewable are the performances of Dane Clark and Buddy Ebsen. It's like water and oil. Clark is the ""fly by the seat of your pants - happy go lucky guy"" who will try anything for a dime. Ebsen stands for reason and patients. Ultimately we learn to use the tools we are given with a sense of responsibility tempered with passion. This is an excellently conceived and delivered episode. IT'S A GOOD LIFE from the Third season aired on November 3, 1961. It was written by Rod Serling and is one of the most famous episodes of the series. Serling's introduction, which leads up to Billy Mumy's wide-eyed stare into the camera, is an indelible and disturbing image. The jack-in-the-box scene is also unforgettable and equally disturbing. Even Serling's dialogue is so memorable and conjures up images of fear. Just the mention of ""the cornfield"" sends chills down the back. Anyone who has seen this episodes knows what I am referring to. Anyone who has not must see it! The excellent cast includes John Larch, Cloris Leachman, Tom Hatcher and we must not forget Billy Mumy. Director Jim Sheldon really captured the fear and terror of the captive inhabitants of this rural community. NICK OF TIME from the Second season aired on November 18, 1960 and was written by Richard Matheson. Traveling newlyweds William Shatner and Patricia Breslin stop in a luncheonette while their car is being repaired. While in a booth an ever-confident Shatner puts a coin into a fortune-telling machine adorned with the bobbling head of a smiling plastic devil. Each question and answer begins to make Shatner question his fate to the point that he becomes unraveled about his future. Thematically this is similar to THE FEVER where just one more coin in the machine may give you solace. This is a fascinating episode that bears repeated viewing just to observe the ease at which one can be drawn in. However, the denouement makes the morality of the story clear. THE MIND AND THE MATTER directed by Buzz Kulik from the Second season aired on May 12, 1961 and was written by Rod Serling. Clerk, Shelly Berman eliminates people from the face of the earth by using the power of thought that he mastered from a book given to him. He soon repopulates the planet with people who look exactly like him with disconcerting results. Though lighthearted in nature this episode attempts to reveal life as others view each of us. Be careful of what you wish for. Volume 9 is a good well-balanced representation of THE TWILIGHT ZONE.",N/A

There were too many holes to allow me to give a full five stars such as: why put Wesley Crusher and Guinan in the wedding scene to never show them again (very brief cameo)? The story lines didn't always transition smoothly; the development of Picard's clone could have been done more effectively; etc.However, the movie was entertaining, particularly for Trekkies.

She's leading a secret life, turning tricks to support a cocaine habit, and losing her mind.  Since the age of 12 a man she knows as &quot;Bob&quot; has been molesting her.  The closer she gets to figuring out who Bob is, the nuttier she gets.  I think Fire Walk With Me has more bizarre &quot;dream&quot; sequences than the entire Twin Peaks series.  Very bizarre stuff.  I've been a fan of David Lynch for a long time, but I don't watch t.v.  So I never saw Twin Peaks while it was airing.  I did see Fire Walk With Me shortly after its release.  Another great David Lynch film (my favorite is still &quot;Blue Velvet&quot;), I was especially drawn in by Sheryl Lee's performance.  This film is what turned me on to Twin Peaks.  Not the other way around.  Luckily my sister-in-law had almost every episode on video.  I don't have the usual complaints about certain Twin Peaks characters not being in Fire Walk With Me.  This movie is all about Laura Palmer's last days, which is interesting enough.  However, it would have been nice to see some deleted scenes from Fire Walk With Me.  If Lynch had at least 4 hours, there had to have been something of value that got cut.  It's dvd, so why not?",Twin Peaks: Fire Walk With Me VHS

During the great migration, a moody mammoth (Ray Romano, ""Everybody Loves Raymond""), a dim-witted sloth (John Leguizamo, ""Moulin Rouge"") and a devilish sabre-toothed tiger (Denis Leary, ""Rescue Me"") become the unlikely guardians of a lost human child. Together, they will embark on a journey across icy glaciers and countless dangers to return the child to his tribe. Created by Blue Sky Studios, ""Ice Age"" is a remarkably entertaining family spectacle that ranks as one of the highest grossing films of 2002. The story is fast-paced, heartfelt and very funny. The computer-animated feature film contains some hilarious moments and memorable characters. The CGI animation is stunning with impressive landscapes.

362525,"""The Wedding Banquet"" is a rather moving film by Ang Lee that starts out as a comedy and moves on to become an insightful study of the complex relationship that is family.Ting Gao [Winston Chao] is a thirtysomething Taiwanese immigrant who lives in New York, where he has a real estate business. He seems to be heavily subsidized by his wealthy family back home. His Mom and Dad are constantly pushing him to get married. Why can he not grant his father's fondest wish to become a grandfather? Ting can't do his parents' long distance bidding because he happens to be gay. He lives happily with a nice guy named Simon [Mitchell Lichtenstein]. The very American and liberated Simon is wise enough to see that cultural differences prevent his lover from admitting the truth. The deception is no problem until the folks announce their imminent arrival in New York. The boys come up with a plan. Ting will marry their friend Wei-Wei [May Chin], who happens to need a green card anyway. The parents will arrive, Wei-Wei and Ting will marry in a civil ceremony, the family will leave, and life will return to normal. All goes according to plan until an old family acquaintance shows up and insists on giving the bride and groom a lavish, old-fashioned Chinese wedding banquet. The plan then hits some serious snags.""The Wedding Banquet"" is actually a Taiwanese movie shot on location in America. At least half of it is in Chinese, which will irritate anyone who despises subtitles. For everyone else, though, the movie will be a treat. It is more than an interesting study of cultural differences. It is great portrait of a remarkable family, one in which love ultimately redeems everyone, even if truth and reality get rearranged in the process.",The Wedding Banquet VHS

394456,"One of the challenges of regularly viewing cheesy monster movies is knowing the difference between ""so bad, it's good,"" and just plain bad.  This movie is laughable, but is it intentionally so?  A normal-sized Gila monster crawls over miniature detailed sets, spreading death along a dry riverbed and the nearby highway.  It crushes toy cars and slithers over twigs pretending to be logs.  After knocking down a Lincoln-log railroad bridge, the creeping terror attacks a Lionel train.  By the way, did anyone notice that the diesel engine kept changing looks, not to mention directions?  Continuity issues aside, the movie lacks credible special effects.  There are no mixed shots showing live (i.e., non-toy) backgrounds contrasting size with the alleged giant lizard.  Instead, there are sporadic close-ups of a huge clawed-foot attacking the camera lens.  The teenagers are the community's early warning system that danger is afoot, but the authorities are skeptical.  Do you ever remember an old monster movie where the cops believed the kids the first time?  The director loves the ""knee-up"" school of acting.  Masculine legs are up on every desk, workbench, and fender in sight.  Good old boys while pondering sideways skid marks can think better this way, I guess.  Shug Fisher is around for laughs, but comic relief is a moot point in this movie.  Before Festus, Ken Curtis tried his hand at producing.

74645,"Jacob's Ladder is a tough film if you want a simple ending, if you want it to be contrite and plausible.  This movie is anything but.  Danny Aiello as your chiropractor trying to explain life and death and existence is enough to both laugh at and find hilarious.The whole movie flirts and eventually decides on the premise that we all make decisions, even teh relaly big ones about life and death and whether or not to accept it.  (Similar to the Tananarive Due book The Between).  However this movie asks you to take a simple precept: that your whole life flashes before yoru eyes when you die and accept it.  But at the same time it also forces you to understand that your whole life includes the possibilities that it could've been had you not died.  See that's where it all gets freaky and the remote control is tossed over your shoulder and you shake your head.But think on it.What of the millions of dead just within the last century, what would've become of them had they lived.  How many Beethovens or Baldwins or Hawkings would've been birthed by the dead?  Okay, suppose even further that you got to see/project onto this screen of possibility and that's where Jacob's Ladder picks up from.Except it takes a normal man and allows him (the real question is whether it's his mind and his body or only his mind) to slip though the cracks in death, to reject the dissolution of form to body and instead ressurrect himself in form and thought.  See, now you're tossing the movie box cover because there is an allusion to Jesus Christ and Dante's Inferno and the concept that our last fear is death but not of dying, the physical thought of death but accepting that life is over.  We can imagine an injury in war, as happens here but we can't accept the thought that the show's over on this plane of existence, no matter who comes to try and get you to accept it----your dead child, a chiropractor/angel, demons.  Because teh movie kind of alludes to the concept that we leave breadcrumbs, spritiual ones throughout our life and good and evil track us by them.  The more powerful you conceive of, or perhaps actualize yourself as the greater possibility that your demons are gonna come for you.The movie is not so much of an enigma as three questions lined up.  If you give it over to the first then you have to take the next leaps.Question 1: What if &quot;death&quot; through some kind of medical experimentation/cosmic fluke became a choice?Question 2: Who would be &quot;sent&quot; to get you to accept death?Question 3: What would you have created in life during the time that you were to be dead?You can also say that there's the question of who's imagining what here as the character's perceptions of reality overlap to the point of this movie needing a second viewing.  But each time you watch it ask your a different question.  What if he's dead?  What if the experimentation saved his life?  What if this is his thought projection about the last bits of his life, its possibilities?A super film.",N/A
691102,"In a year that saw Richard Linklater release an excellent animated film-WAKING LIFE, he also released this smaller, but tenacious film-and both are very good. It's hard not to compare this to other single-room films(a very specific subgenre) like ROPE, SECRET HONOR, or maybe COMING APART, but it still holds up pretty well. Ethan Hawke and Robert Sean Leonard are old friends in real life and I think that really helps contribute to this being a believeable and engaging view. It's a really well written film(using Stephen Belber's play), and Linklater gets creative with his two-digital camera set-up. I was suprised that the dvd commentary wasn't really mentioned on the front of the disc(on the back it says &quot;Production Commentary&quot;).  The commentary features Richard Linklater and Ethan Hawke-both have many interesting things to say(although it seems that the commentaries were recorded at different times and cut together). I like this trend of Linklater filming plays. Maybe he'll take an  Altman-like turn and do several more(Altman's play-adaptions are pretty cool-I have to cite STREAMERS, FOOL FOR LOVE and COME BACK TO THE FIVE AND DIME JIMMY DEAN, JIMMY DEAN as a few that I really enjoyed).",Tape

370844,"""Our Hospitality"" and ""Sherlock Jr."" are two of Buster Keaton's finest silent films.In ""Our Hospitality"", Buster plays Willie McKay, a naive New York City resident (if you can call New York a city in 1830) who returns to his native south to collect an estate from his mother who has just recently died.  Unfortunately, McKay's family has been involved in a backwoods feud with the Canfield family who are determined to kill off the last surviving McKay.Further complicating matters, Willie finds himself falling in love with the elder Canfield's daughter who invites him to dinner.  The Canfields will not shoot McKay in their house as this violates their code of honor (there is apparently nothing dishonorable about shooting McKay outside).  This leads to a series of hilarious comic situations as Willie must find ways to prolong his visit.  Later, when he runs out of excuses, he must find a way to sneak out without being recognized.  Wait till you see what he uses for a disguise!The film leads up to a hilarious and exciting chase sequence ending on a river.  Buster Keaton was quite the acrobat.  It's amusing how throughout the film he pokes fun at the south's twisted sense of hospitality.  There's also a surprisingly touching finale.""Sherlock Jr."" is another great, albeit short film.  Buster plays a hapless movie projectionist and amateur detective who is wrongly accused of stealing his girlfriend's father's watch.  Ostrasized by his girlfriend, Buster falls asleep in the projection room and in his dream, walks into the movie and interacts with the characters.  In his dream, he imagines himself as the great detective Sherlock Jr. and attempts to find the culprit of a stolen watch.""Sherlock Jr."" is an interesting film as it deals with Keaton's fascination with the film medium.  The special effects for the scene where Buster walks into the screen were incredible for their time.  This scene has been copied a lot in subsequent films.  Unfortunately, the film is marred somewhat by the inane music score which someone decided to tack on.  Nevertheless, it's well worth viewing.Buster Keaton was a genius.  His best films matched, if not surpassed those of his rival Charlie Chaplin.  They were cinematically superior and had better stuntwork (nothing wrong with Chaplin mind you).

146890,"Satyricon was written during the reign of Nero. A sarcastic, bawdy novel about decadence and extravagance in Rome, it semed like an ideal vehicle for Fellini. Unfortunately, Fellini made a visually amazing film that left out the humor of the novel. We are left with a cool and detached look at pagan Rome that never quite takes off. Scenes go on too long with little purpose. Theatricality takes precedence over spontaniety and vitality. The film doesn't seem to have a center - none of the characters really matter. What we have is a series of picture postcards - a sort of diorama - of ancient Rome. Even for someone who loves ancient history, such as myself, this was difficult to sit through.

I've read reviews of what the movie was going to be about and the road they were taking on the concept and storyline, then it occured to me that the movie was going to be very bad.  I thought it was going to be another B monster movie with a popular title slapped onto it.  I saw it on opening day and I'm glad to say that those reviews weren't correct and the movie was awesome.  There was so much of the video game that was in the movie.  I would say 80%, maybe more.  There are plenty of hungry flesh eating zombies to creep you out, zombie dogs, a crazy supercomputer, the T-virus, and the licker.  The main star Alice (Milla Jovovich) reminds me so much of Jill Valentine from Capcom's ""Resident Evil 3: Nemesis"" that the movie makers could of just named her Jill.  But I guess they wanted to have different characters in the movie.  By the way, she is hot.  In any case, the movie is especially great for fans of the game, but also can be enjoyed by horror fans as well.  ""Resident Evil"" definately has a lot of heart stopping moments that can raise the dead and I would recommend this to you, Resident Evil fans and to you zombie lovers worldwide.",N/A

Usually, the teen turns out to be right about everything, and the grown-ups are just cretins with no concept of how the real world works.  American Beauty is a great example.  Thankfully, this movie doesn't trot down that path, Enid (played by an excellent Thora Birch) is cynical and distrustful of everything and everyone.  She plays horrible pranks on people and basically likes no one.  That changes when she meets Seymour (played by an always great Steve Buscemi).  She says he is &quot;everything I don't hate&quot; or something along those lines.  It's those kind of lines that give you an idea of the attitude this movie has.  It's quite an honest film that confronts many different issues, and does a better job than most movies that only take on one.  All the performances are excellent, and the direction is subtle, only after a few viewings do the images start to jump out at you.  It does have a few of those moments that make me want to vomit, such as the guy who finally gets his bus.

I was looking for deeper character development than I ever got. We get to know Ving Rhames character the most (mainly because he's a replica of Mike Tyson) and he's the antagonist. We get introduced to several supporting characters (Wes Studi, Fisher Stevens, Peter Falk, Michael Rooker, Jon Seda) here and there for whatever reason. However, they're all a prison clich&eacute;.The character we never get to know, oddly, is the hero, played by Wesley Snipes. We can only assume that Snipes is the hero because of his sensitive hobby of making houses out of toothpicks. Other than that, Snipes has only about twenty lines. It's weird. Rhames even though billed second has far more screen time than Snipes.I can't help but feel that this film lost it in the editing room. Somehow this movie feels like half a movie. Like important parts have been chopped away. I just can't imagine writers Walter Hill and David Giler (ALIEN), or any writers for that matter, writing a script with such a non-dimensional lead character.While action film veteran Walter Hill (48 HOURS; LAST MAN STANDING) has learned some stylish new tricks to filmmaking, they're not enough to save his latest effort.

543138,"The plot of Crazy/Beautiful is the common opposites-attract scenario. A rich white girl named Nicole, who is self-destructive and out of control falls in love with a Hispanic boy named Carlos who is doing everything he can to succeed and make a better life for himself. Carlos is a stabilizing force in Nicole's life, but she is a destructive force in his. Even Nicole's own father warns Carlos against getting involved with his daughter. Though the basic plot is extremely formulaic, it does deviate from the norm in a few ways. For example, instead of Nicole's father being racist against Carlos, he genuinely likes him and warns him to stay away from Nicole for his own good. It is Carlos' mother who is unhappy about the relationship and would prefer that he went out with a nice Hispanic girl. The movie is also slower-paced than I would have expected, but I don't mean that as a bad thing. The slow pace allows plenty of time for character development, and is supported by great cinementography and an interesting score. I also expected it to come to a tragic close, but I was surprised to find that it ended happily. This film is perfect for young adults, but I think it should also have some appeal for the slightly more mature crowd.",Crazy/ Beautiful

He however with the help on an excellent supporting cast makes passable work of THE FOUR FEATHERS.Unlike previous versions of the film the battles are not the star here.  This is a shame in one respect as Kapur dos a spectauclar job  with the battle scene.  I think he would have done a grand job with a more fighting.This movie gives dimension to the characters both friend and foe, from the Vicar, to the jailer, (who has very few lines but is impressive)on down.  These characters make the movie breathe.  About the only character without depth is Kate Hudson, considering the screen time she gets I would have expected more.The war against the Madi itself is quite interesting and would be worth a full movie itself, ...  To  its credit it doesn't propose sainthood for either side, but shows war as a gritty dirty business.  The picture gives no hint of the final result of the war.  The battle of Omdurman (Where a young Churchill took part in the British Army's last calvery charge.)or the fall of the Madi, only the story matters.Although the characters are interesting we don't see enough of Tim Pigott-Smith as Ledger's father.  He has screen presence and it is underused in the movie.  On the other hand Djimon Hounsou performance was commanding.  We are left hanging with him.  A sequel telling the rest of the story of the war from his eyes would be worth the price of admission.The transfers from some important points near the end was sloppy, I felt that we were missing an important scene or 2.Still worth the money, but make sure you rent the Ralph Richardson version afterward, (Even the Beau Bridges version has some merit) Then you will have the whole story.",N/A

598011,"Stately, elegiac and beautifully photographed Road to Perdition is a tale of redemption and revenge.  Tom Hanks is Michael Sullivan, stone killer and first assistant to mob boss John Rooney (Paul Newman).  Twelve-year old son, Michael Jr. sneaks a ride with Dad and Conner Rooney (Daniel Craig), worthless son of the boss, to see what exactly it is that Dad does for a living.  Young Michael gets a knee-high view of a talk that went wrong that turned into a hit by the impulsive and reprehensible Connor.  Mike, Sr. did the clean up with a tommy gun.  When Mike, Jr. is discovered, the dilemma is set in motion.  Fearing that the boy will be unable to keep a secret, Connor, with astounding ineptness, kills the younger son and mother, mistaking him for Mike Jr.  Father and son abandon everything and hit the road for six weeks, partly in flight, partly to plot and carry out revenge.It is worth the price of the ticket just to see Newman and Hanks interacting.  Newman has the dramatic role of anguished love for his adopted aide, a lilting Irish charm, and a deadly coldness.  Hanks is subdued, probably not overly bright, taciturn and determined.  As usual, his eyes tell the story.  Jude Law in the scene-stealing role of assassin McGuire is a marvel of slithery, oddly graceful pop-eyed menace.  You tend to forget about him for a while, but then he pops up unexpectedly and startles you anew.  Stanley Tucci is a splendid suave, civilized Frank Nitti.  Poor Jennifer Jason Leigh as the wife and mother had not more than five lines of dialogue, which was rather a waste.The mood and the settings were dark.  It rained and sleeted and snowed; everything and everybody looked miserable in the cityscapes.  I would guess the original locale was supposed to be Rock Island, IL, a very corrupt fiefdom of the Chicago mob during prohibition.  I was continually reminded of artist Edward Hopper and his painting Nighthawks.  Road to Perdition imbues the viewer with the same loneliness, separation and disassociation of the big unfeeling city.  The ballet-like scene of Rooney's assassination in the rain, umbrellas like graceful markers-all without sound --- is unforgettable.All was not perfect.  The static voice-over introducing and ending the film weakened it.  The harsh solution to the boy's keeping a secret seemed unreal to me.  A major point in the movie was redemption for the boy, where the father was doomed for the life he had led.  Then why did the father make the boy his accomplice; further physically and morally endangering him?  Well, there would not have been a story if Hanks had found a monastery to hide the boy, now would there?

690951,"""Life As A House"" is the brilliant and inspiring film directed by Irwin Winkler and written by Mark Andrus.PLOT SUMMARY: George Monroe (Kevin Kline) is a divorced man around his mid-fourties who has just learned that he is dying from cancer. His relationship with his rebellious, strained teenage son, Sam (Hayden Christensen) is, if anything, invisible. Sam lives with George's ex-wife, Robin Kimball (Kristin Scott Thomas), who married another man. When George insists that Sam spend the summer with him in his shack-of-a-home, which is actually a garage, Sam thinks his life is over. George decides to rebuild his runt-down house in the time that he has left to live. As he builds the house with his family, George starts to learn more about his family as Sam starts to learn about life. Also helping out is a neighbor, Alyssa Beck (Jena Malone), who grows close to Sam.MY OVERALL THOUGHTS: I thought ""Life As A House"" was a wonderful film. The acting performances were truly superb and could only make the film better and more enjoyable. Stand-out performances include Kline and Christensen--two extremely talented actors with great father/son on-screen chemistry. There wasn't much in the way of special effects, because it's a more drama, but the screenplay was well-written and the characters were well developed. The storyline was excellent, too. This film is filled with emotions--from the confused, rebellion of Sam, to the sadness that George will eventually die. What's interesting about this film is to see how George reconnects with his family after being away from them for so long.The DVD extras are a plus to ""Life As A House"". The bonus material include deleted scenes, two original documentaries, theatrical press kit (which include cast and crew biographies), DVD-ROM extras, theatrical trailer, and more. The DVD is available in wide screen format.I highly recommend ""Life As A House"".Score:100/100A+",N/A

We never found out about it until the movie came out on cable a couple of years later and we happen to see him in the scene. He's the asian guy with glasses sitting next to John Murray's character (Dana Cannon) when all the other characters in the film are being sentenced to traffic school. They actually exchange glances with each other when Murray is rattling on with one of his smart remarks during the scene. Otherwise, MOVING VIOLATIONS aims for a low brow audience and delivers. A simple and funny plot where various people with multiple traffic violations are sentenced to traffic school and have their vehicles impounded until they pass traffic school. They then band together when they uncover a scam by the police officer (James Keach) giving the traffic school course, to sell the impounded vehicles. They have to stop and expose his plot to the authorities. John Murray's character is a rehash of all characters of the more famous and older sibling Bill, from his previous work in SNL, STRIPES and GHOSTBUSTERS. However, because he is a ""Murray"" it is to be expected and his character is pretty funny as the as the [truck driver].

358308,"This film, released the week of the coronation of Queen Elizabeth II in 1953, is a highly fictionalized account of the early life of Elizabeth I.Jean Simmons and Stewart Granger had been married for three years at the time of this film's release. While their union would only last for seven years afterwards, this film proves that it was a very productive union while it hung together.It begins on the eve of Elizabeth's ascension to the throne, when her governess, Catherine Ashley, played by a discreet and dignified Kaye Walsh, visits the steward, Mr. Parry, played by a booming-voiced and jovial Cecil Kellaway, to inform him that Elizabeth's half-sister, Mary, is dying, begining a long reminiscence about Mrs. Ashley's adventures in raising a royal heir.Charles Laughton resumes the role he originally had as Henry VIII 20 years earlier in ""The Private Life of Henry VIII"" in this film, and he was still very much up to the challenge. He is depicted as taking delight in the birth of his daughter with Anne Boleyn, played by a convivial Elaine Stewart, when in reality, it's a well known fact that his feelings about the birth of another girl were very different.All too soon, Elizabeth's mother is sent to the block for treason, and the red-haired toddler begins the first of many subsequent journeys to exile at Hatfield House in Hertfordshire in Mrs. Ashley's arms.At about age six, the pouty girl, now played by Noreen Corchran, is returned to court in what becomes a tragi-comic sequence. We only hear the voice of Henry's German-born fourth wife, Anne of Cleves. Sometime, thereafter, Elizabeth warms to a third step-mother, her cousin, Catherine Howard, played by a charming Dawn Addams. But Catherine's time as Elizabeth's step-mother is severed by an executioner's axe.In reality, there was only a year's difference between the end of Henry's fith marriage and the beginning of his sixth. But by that time, embittered little Noreen Corchran grows into embittered big Jean Simmons, who initially refuses to set foot outside her room when summoned to court to meet another step-mother.Luckily, Henry sends Stewart Granger's booming, authoritative-voiced Lord Admiral Thomas Seymour to persuade her to do otherwise.Deborah Kerr was well-chosen for the part of Catherine Parr, as she resembles a painting of Henry VIII's last Queen. Her sweet motherly mannerisms appeal to Elizabeth, and despite certain naysayings by her impish half brother, Prince Edward, played by a stately but still boyish Rex Thompson, who, like Jean Simmons, might have dyed his hair red for the part for the sake of authenticity, Elizabeth and the Queen become great friends.On an outing at sea, the scenario that could have gotten Catherine Parr charged with treason is touched upon, and we are introduced to Tom Seymour's brother Ned, played by a petty and conniving Guy Rolf. In his scene, and the next one in which Henry is on his deathbed, Elizabeth asserts herself in ways that take her distant father aback.With Mrs. Ashley's guidance, the young princess must steer her way through the political intrigues of the day, and deal with her growing feelings for the Admiral. Sadly, she watches as Tom Seymour and Catherine Parr marry, a union in which she is instrumental in helping cement. Ned Seymour's venomous natures grows rapidly after he usurps the role of the Lord Protector, which ultimately leads to his brother's downfall. Stewart Granger is fun to watch in the role of a doting uncle to the little King.One accuracy of the film is the inclusion of the page, Barnaby Fitzpatrick, to whom Robert Arthur gives a smitten adolescent nature. Barnaby watches as Elizabeth blossoms, especially the night of a ball hosted for a Danish envoy. The Danske dance was especially delightful.When Tom can no longer contain his feelings for his young ward, Bess is sent away, and Catherine dies sometime afterwards.While the film is sympathetic to the romance of the Admiral and the future Queen, by today's standards, Tom Seymour might be deemed a pervert who was worthy of the end to which he came.However, Elizabeth is offered one final moment of gallantry at her trial. One feels such intensity as well as triumph when she horsewhips the Lord Protector. Watch for Kathleen Byron,who in recent years played Private Ryan's wife, as Ann Seymour.In the grand style of MGM movies of the 50s, viewers are rewarded with marvelous sets and scenes and beautiful, albeit often re-used costumes, which, like some of the sets, can be seen in other MGM films of the era.Miklos Roska's score is regal and inspiring, and the overall production of this film, dazzling.

102688,"Milos Forman's Amadeus is a hugely entertaining adaptation of Peter Shaffer's play. The movie is told in flashback style from the memory of Antonio Salieri. Salieri was a successful and popular composer who was a rival of Mozart's. History has speculated on the death of Mozart and some people are of the opinion that Salieri had a hand in his death (possibly even murdered him). The film explores this angle of the legend. Salieri is consumed by his jealousy and hatred of the infantile Mozart. Mozart is a musical genius, but a wild spending and is always looking for the next good time. His operas are utterly brilliant, but are unsuccessful. He is in constant debt. Salieri concocts a plan for Mozart to compose a requiem. This work is actually planned as Mozart's own requiem. Mozart is shown as slowly going mad and at the end of the film, Salieri helps him by writing the musical score down for a very weak Mozart. The morning after Mozart and Salieri work together, Mozart is found dead and we are left speculating whether he died through natural causes or if Salieri did something to him. F. Murray Abrham is absolutely amazing as Salieri. He brings across the jealousy and hatred, but doesn't make Salieri a fiend. He has major respect for Mozart's musical talents, but doesn't understand why God would give them to such an obvious heathen. Tom Hulce is equally as good as Mozart. He plays him with a reckless abandon and in an over the top fashion that is perfectly suited for the role. The film took home the 1984 Best Picture Oscar, Mr. Forman won Best Director and Mr. Abrham beat out Mr. Hulce for Best Actor. This was a case where a tie would have been more than appropriate. The new director's cut adds 20 minutes of footage, but the real standout is the remastered sound.  The Dolby 5.1 version brings alive the sounds of Mozart in brilliant detail.",N/A

712535,"I never thought I'd do it, but here I am purchasing (and rating) a DVD of probably the most rerun series in TV history. Makes one wonder why buy it in the first place. In my case I was fascinated (and educated) by the DVD's revelation that the show's presentation was altered after its network broadcasts. Most of us grew up with LUCY, but only in syndication, and many things about the show were changed for syndication, from the opening credits (the Philip Morris sponsor was more predominant, and the &quot;heart-on-satin&quot; logo came much later) to background music, sponsor placement, and even one moment of censorship which involved a passionate kiss by Lucy and actual husband Desi Arnaz (drastically pared down by rerun time). The genius of the DVD is that it restores all these elements back to their original 1951 content, and even includes two radio broadcasts of LUCY's prototype, &quot;My Favorite Husband.&quot; As far as the episodes themselves are concerned: 'Drafted' is the least entertaining and most contrived (the misunderstanding reaches outrageous proportions); 'Men Are Messy' and 'The Fur Coat' are standard Lucy shenanigans; and the 'Girl Singer' episode is the best- although the girl (Helen Silver) is actually a gorgeous dancer, and smolders in the 'Jezebel' number. Lucy goes brunette in the chorus line, and wreaks classic havoc.","I Love Lucy: Season 1, Vol.3"
696457,"At this point in the series the show had been running smoothly for several years and had built up a serious following. Thus, the result is a season with consistently solid writing, the usual high standard of acting and some wonderfully innovative special effects pices (no longer does the viewer sit there cursing tyhe series for not having a bigger budget like seasons 1 and 2).Arguably fifth season was the apex of the series, where everything was running smoothly and week after week the show was churning out classics. Whie I personally don't believe this is the best year (I prefer season 3,4 and 6), fifth season has many episodes which rank in any Trekkers top twenty (sadly I have one).Redemption II opens things with a relative bang and thankfully puts to an end the lengthy Klingon civil war saga. Warf's family name is cleared and he rejoins the crew of the Enterprise (I think everyone knew this would happen anyway).Darmok, the season's second episode is undoubtedly one of the show's best moments. Patrick Stewart turns in a virtuso performance alongside Paul Winfield (remember him in Terminator?). Some of the season's other high points are, Cause and Effect in which the Enterprise gets caught in a time loop only to find Frasier at the other end, The Game, a Wesley Crusher comeback special, I Borg, an exploration in humanity with a lone Borg, and The Next Phase, arguably Geordi's best episode to himself (Booby Trap is up there).Then we have the peabody winning 'The Inner Light' which is certainly one of the show's most touching and well written episodes.Unfortunately there are a few episodes that suffer from the old ""Shakka when the walls fell syndrome"" ... The Masterpiece Society is as banal as any episode and Violation is another clunker but these are only minor bumps int he road.A fine effort of a season with an intelligent and savvy cliffhanger.",Star Trek The Next Generation - The Complete Fifth Season

591924,"Let's face it, the original Blade is a classic, and following-up on it was a daunting task.Fortunately, Blade II seemed to capture most of the best aspects of the original. About the only thing that lacked in this movie was a meaningful plot. At the end of the film, several questions buzzed in my head, as the characters and screenplay included some inconsistencies that simply were never adequately explained. The biggest one being... Whistler was supposed to have killed himself in the original movie (they even replay the scene where he supposedly shoots himself), yet he is alive and well in the sequel. Go figure.Despite the various problems with the plot, the movie was very entertaining, and Blade fans will not be disappointed. As usual, Wesley Snipes IS Blade, and several other actors put in good performances as well. The soundtrack is o.k., but it was nothing comparable to The Matrix, or something like that. The visuals and special effects were fantastic, without being so overdone as to ""look fake"".There are some great martial arts scenes, terrific action, and tons of what made the original Blade a cult classic.

583665,"In this movie co-written by Billy Bob Thornton (with Tom Epperson), director Sam Raimi successfully produces an enjoyable often edge of the seat part courtroom, part psychic gothic thriller, starring the excellent Aussie actress Cate Blanchett and a fine ensemble cast.Set in small town Georgia, Blanchett plays Annie Wilson, a financially struggling, recently widowed, lonely single parent who uses her card reading psychic ability to pay the bills. Among her clients are a battered wife, Valerie Barksdale (wonderfully played by Hilary Swank) and a traumatised local mechanic named Buddy Cole (brilliantly played by Giovanni Ribisi), who is struggling to hold onto his sanity. Traumatised by recurring visions surrounding the death of local tramp Jessica King (Katie Holmes), she sets out to help the police find the body and find the killer. The prime suspect is Donnie Barksdale played by Keanu Reeves, who gives a passable performance, as Swank's violent wife-beating bully of a husband. He was known to be having an affair with Holmes and previously threatened to kill Annie and so starts the courtroom drama that dominates the middle of the film.The strength of this gothic noir movie really is in the suspense, the expectation of doom and the excellent performances from Blanchett, Ribisi and Swank, with good support from Katie Holmes. It is subtly directed by Raimi and he expertly brings a southern gothic feel to the whole movie. However, Keanu Reeves and Greg Wise (as Holmes fianc&eacute;e) are not quite as strong and I felt the movie tailed off slightly at the end, with the inevitable slightly predictable `twist', which most people will see coming a mile off. That said it's well worth a view, definitely above average and a bit of a must for Blanchett and Raimi fans particularly.",N/A

502729,"This French short film, which was nominated for and WON both the Cannes Film Festival Award and an Academy Award, brings Ambrose Bierce's short story to life in a powerful way. With very little dialogue, this film, while discarding Bierce's explanation of how Peyton Farquhar was captured and sentenced to hang as a spy (and which actually is not necessary, in my opinion), depends on the visual rather than the spoken and succeeds admirably! The film may last less than half an hour, but in that time the viewer is rivetted not only by Roger Jacquet's performance as the condemned man but also by the beautiful scenery, the tight editing and just the right pacing of the action (the music, especially the slow lovely ballad ""A Livin' Man"", sung in the style of the Old Southern spirituals, also sticks with the viewer). The twist ending (which is worthy of the best TWILIGHT ZONE episodes [which, by the way, this film was used for in the fifth and final season of that wonderful series]), made me actually catch my breath, more than when I actually read ths original story.

683312,"If you're a fan of the original three seasons of ABFAB like me then this fourth season might feel like a bit of a let down.  It seems that all the characters have been changed in slight ways that somehow messes with the magic formula created originally.  Saffy seems a bit more aggressive, Edina more cruel, patsy more alive and Gran more ditzy than ever.  edina seems to have been beaten down and is ready to do things that she never wouls've dreamed of doing in the first series (dieting) and Patsy has lost that far off, dazed drugged out aspect and is now playing a dominatrix, trying to be a model and other such asprations.  It makes for some funny situations, but it's doesn't quite feel like ABFAB.  In no way are these shows bad, just not as fabulous as the originals.The DVD itself has terrific production qualities.  The picture is widescreen and colors are bright and crisp.  The menus are easy to navigate and there is pleny of bonus mterial.  OF that bonus material, ""Mirror Ball"" is the best.  It's a pilot for a  series Jennifer Saunders was working on that features all the actors of ABFAB, but in different roles and in a different setting.  it's quite fun to see them doing different charactes for a change.  Too bad it never got picked up.  My only qualm with the DVD is that the text on the character bio screen (as well as a few others), is terribly hard to read.  This is a consistant problem with DVDs and why the makers of these things don't realise that we actually might want to read what they've put so much time and effort into is beyond me.For die hards, this set can't be missed, but people who are new to the show should check out the original three seasons first.

537223,"I have seen this movie twice and both times I enjoyed it.Long, probably so but no longer than many WW II movies of the past.In order to make a good historical movie that everyone ""can"" enjoy, you need three things:Romance, Action, and Reality.The romance portion of this movie is exactly how it was back then. No one was sure whether they would ever see each other again so life was, shall I say, lived to the fullest.Many people fell in and out of love several times due to death or loss of a partner.Of course this movie plays an old angle, have the best friend fall in love with the girl when the first goes missing.....well we all know it happened and still happens. You could probably find several stories from wartime veterans of just such an occurrance.The action part? well, it goes without saying, afterall this is a war film and even though the film isn't riddled with war footage, there is plenty to keep the average person entertained.There was also enough of a break between combat sequences; from the British Air Force footage to the Doolittle Raid with the attack on Pearl Harbor right in the middle; that I never got overly tired of watching things blow up.Historically everything that occurred during the actual combat footage happened.I have read and heard some say that Cuba Gooding Jr.'s appearnace was only to fill the void of no Black actors. This just isn't so....Cuba Gooding, Jr. plays a real-life hero of World War II, the first black man to win the Navy Cross.The woman too were portrayed accurately. They may be there because they thought it would be exciting and they would meet men, but when they are needed, they are strong, brave, and dedicated.Of course as with almost all war movies, there is bound to be inaccuracies. Screenplay writers and dirctors both know that if you follow history to the letter you have a documentary, not a story everyone can enjoy.It could also be mentioned that the portrayal of the Japanese was probably softened somewhat. Political correctness virtually prohibits writers from telling the truth of how brutal the enemy was at the time. Even though Japan is one of our greatest Allies of present day, they were our enemy 60 years ago...But this movie is reminiscent of many past war movies. Filling all the needs of romance, action, and (hopefully) accuracy.By the way: I had my parents watch this movie with me. My Dad was stationed in the Pacific right after the war started and my Mom worked at an army Fort in the states. They both say it is one of the best WW II movies they have ever seen in recent years.",N/A

Not only does it contain excellent animation, superior to the already high quality animation of the tv seris under the same name; but the music and the quality of the feelings evoked while watching this film are enough to make the excellent (aka. extremely low) price of this DVD the best bargain you will ever find.Sakura and Co. (Kero-chan, Tomoyo, Touya, and Yukito) take a trip to Hong Kong! A trip to Syaoran-kun and Meiling's home town?! How fun! Little do they know that the mysterious way that Sakura happened to aquire this trip means that they will all be caught up in one of Sakura's most dangerous trials to date!

The movie is based on the Rebecca Wells's bestseller and as it is most of the time, the movie doesn't do justice to the book.  Ladies will love the movie as they did the book.  It's a warm well told story, it has tremendous feel and is well acted and well written. This all-star cast left little doubt that this was going to be a good movie.  It was a matter of how well first time director Callie Khouri would be able to blend this ensemble of great actors.  Usually one would out shine the other, but balance was gotten and result was fantastic; if you love this kind or drama.  Drama, did I write, I'm not sure about that.  Some might say a romantic comedy!  Sandra plays a successful playwright still having to deal with an over powering and manipulative mother. Her mother's Ya-Ya friends (the sisterhood), drug and kidnap her in an attempt to reunited daughter with mother. If any of us did that we would be facing jail time!

357020,"I came into this film with possibly unrealistic expectations.  I had heard so much about it, that I thought there was no way it could live up to the hype.It did.The Seventh Seal is an amazing movie.  It concerns a disillusioned Swedish knight (von Sydow) who returns from the Crusades to find his home being ravaged by the plague.  On the shore, he meets a masked robed figure who claims to be Death.  Rather than running in terror, the world-weary knight challenges him to a game of chess.  The game is played over several days, during which Bloc gets a look at how the townspeople are reacting in religious terror to the plague.There are two parts of the film to be addressed.  Bergman's writing is anything but subtle.  It is the writing of a young artist just finding his voice.  He is trying to answer question life, God and morality.  The film asks how one can maintain faith when God is silent.  In this respect, the film is powerful in its bluntness.  Consider the masterful scene in which von Sydow confesses his questioning of faith to a man he thinks is a priest.  How he manages to find life, hope and possibly meaning amidst the rubble of his home in the family of entertainers.  The movie becomes a dark comedy in the late stages, including one of my favorite all-time movie lines as an actor begs for his life.Bergman's directing is also excellent.  The aforementioned confession scence is remarkable.  The closing scene justifiably famous.  This is one of those films where the black and white medium is perfect.This movie is well worth your time, even with he hefty price tag.",The Seventh Seal VHS

596088,"If not for Fox's 24 (yes, the television series), Minority Report would probably be my choice for (so far) the best thriller of the decade.  Pretty hefty statement, I realize, but Minority Report's a pretty hefty movie, one that plays as an innovative mix of futuristic sci-fi and film-noir.  And I'm a little surprised nobody prior to Steven Spielberg has tried for for a similar formula (cases have been made for Blade Runner and Dark City, though I can't entirely agree).Minority Report is set in the year 2054, a future that, outside of the roads and constant eye-scans, still visually resembles the present (or the past, in this movie's case). Tom Cruise stars as John Anderton, one of the heads of Pre-Crime, a division in Washington, D.C. that has the ability to stop murders before they happen, thanks to the work of three Pre-Cogs, psychics (two male and one female) permanently placed in a watery bath, delivering info about the future to the Pre-Crime division (just how it's done is revealed in a very clever and tense opening sequence).Anyway, there's a debate over whether or not Pre-Crime should go national, and it's something that the people are going to vote on.  The creator of this division, Lamar Burgess (Max Von Sydow), is a bit wary of the FBI agent (Colin Farrell) sent to investigate the way the division operates and the possible infallibilities.Anderton himself has a bit of a mess in his personal life.  He lost his son six years ago, is divorced, and is addicted to illegal drugs.  But matters grow even worse when the Pre-Cogs' latest vision displays a pre-meditated murder (unsurprisingly stated as a rarity in D.C.) and the killer happens to be Anderton himself!  Going on the run, Anderton struggles to escape his old teammates and discover the truth behind this vision; is it a mistake or a genuine view of a nightmarish destiny?First off, let me say hats off to Steven Spielberg.  The man's always had unfounded criticism tossed at him with virtually every film he's ever made.  It's nice to see he's never dissuaded (or influenced) by such complaints, he's a filmmaker who's always crafted his films with a touch of confidence and genuine emotion that few directors could even hope to achieve in decades worth of work (in case you can't tell, I'm a Spielberg fan, meaning I've just incurred the wrath of David Lynch lovers).Spielberg's work here is, right off the bat, much unlike anything I've ever seen him do.  Sure, there was A.I., but not a segment in that film resembled Minority Report's opening scenes, a montage of quick-cuts awash in blue colors that builds in both violence and intensity, in spite of the fact this sequence moves backward (meaning the violent act is committed first, then we see what led up to it).  The segment ends with a close-up of an eye, with the camera pulling back to reveal a woman lying in a pool, ominously stating the word, ""murder.""  It's a chilling, daring intro that holds a lot of promise, and instead of disappointing, the rest of the film actually manages to improve upon it.The future that Spielberg presents here is entirely believable, from both a societal and technological viewpoint.  Most interestingly, when I first saw the previews, I'd expected a ""Big Brother"" type society akin to 1984, one in which the government monitored all the actions of the people.  But that's not the case here.  The government presented here questions the ethics and logic behind Pre-Crime because if this were reality, it's a subject matter of serious concern, and not just hive-minded behavior and blather about how this is good for ""everybody.""  Finally, we get a film that features a dark view of the future, but simultaneously gives us reasonable, intelligent characters that realize there are pros and cons to everything.On a dramatic level, Minority Report delivers with as much resonance as A.I., and maybe even better when you factor in just how coherently and cleverly Spielberg and the writers tie all the subplots together.  The emotional baggage is handled mostly by Tom Cruise, who does quite an admirable job; maybe that's an understatement, like the man or not, he delivers one of the best performances I've seen all year.  No one else except for maybe Colin Farrell and Samantha Morton, comes close to Cruise's powerhouse performance, not even Max Von Sydow.Plot-wise, the film is on solid ground with a few admittedly major stumbles.  One of the movie's narrative burners is the move to make Pre-Crime national, which when you consider the logistics, is almost impossible (3 pre-cogs, an entire country, the cops have to decipher the location through the visual clues; let's face it, you'd need thousands of pre-cogs to pull it off).  (Major spoiler here) The film's big plot twist, while fairly surprising and thought-provoking, doesn't completely hold water.  It's a nice, well-done time loop, but if you consider what happens, then by that basis, I'd suspect a LOT of people could just as easily be accused of murder on such thing ground.Whether or not Minority Report would appeal to the traditional summer crowd is a little iffy.  There's not a whole lot of action (though the jetpack chase/car factory fight is the most hectic, exciting action scene I've seen all year), the story requires undivided attention (and maybe even a repeat viewing to gather in all the themes), and the downbeat tone, almost pessimistic tone will throw a lot of viewers off.  But for those who do get caught up in this twisty tale (and that should apply to most people), Minority Report offers a lot of rewards, more than you could reasonably expect from a big-budget blockbuster.A lot of people see Minority Report as a warning for how far technology could go and bite us back.  While such a statement works to an extent for A.I., Report is mostly about morals, accepted ethics, and an intriguing look on just how far people are willing to go for their own survival in this ""winner takes all"" society.  As far as science fiction goes, the genre hasn't been this damned smart and thought-provoking since Dark City.",N/A

346840,"Based on the novel by Michael Crichton, Philip Kaufman's ""Rising Sun"" (1993) is premised on the idea that Asian people are taking over the United States and doing so by having white people murdered. And the story is told not from an Asian point of view, but from the perspective of two non-Asian L.A.P.D. detectives (Sean Connery and Wesley Snipes) trying to solve such a murder. Given the paucity of prominent Asian people in the U.S. media, this premise is unduly alarmist. Hollywood still needs to do more to acknowledge Asian people as a positive, integral presence in the United States -- rather than as predatory aliens who get ahead at the expense of others. As was publicized when the film was released in 1993, the movie changed the murderer's ethnicity from Japanese (in the novel) to non-Japanese, but this is merely cosmetic because the white female murder victim is still deliberately killed to further the business interests of the Japanese. In other words, the murderer is still acting on behalf of the Japanese corporation. Moreover, the film's epilogue leaves the murderer's identity in doubt. So, the film version of ""Rising Sun"" tries to have it both ways.I've grown very tired of listening to all of the excuses made for ""Rising Sun"": how it's not racist, how the non-Asian characters are just as bad as the Asian characters. This is nonsense. The film clearly capitalizes on the (presumably non-Asian) viewer's fears and misunderstandings of Asian people. All of the bad guys in the movie are either (1) Japanese, (2) working for the Japanese, or (3) blackmailed by the Japanese. So, the Japanese are presented as being the cause of all the villainy in the story. Although some non-Asian characters are given moral frailties, those personality flaws are presented as part of their overall humanity. By contrast, the Japanese antagonists are kept at a distance, so we are encouraged to see their character flaws as inherent in their ethnicity.And in an effort to add ""balance"" to the story, ""Rising Sun"" attempts to show two ""positive"" Japanese characters, but they're just stock figures: the Asian supporting character who proves how ""good"" he is by sacrificing his life so that the non-Asian lead characters can live (message: Asian life isn't as valuable as non-Asian life), and the half-Japanese/half-black female love interest who all but renounces her Asian culture and takes a non-Asian boyfriend. In light of all this, I believe that the filmmakers cast African American actor Wesley Snipes in the movie (his character was ostensibly white in the book) primarily to shield themselves from charges of racism. After all, at the time the film was made, the L.A.P.D. unit that the Snipes character worked for had no black officers -- in fact, it was primarily Asian American. Given its problematic premise, the only way the film could have added balance would have been to make one of the two lead detectives either Japanese or Japanese American.This is the best way to sum up how objectionable ""Rising Sun"" is: Just imagine what the film would be like if the Japanese characters were instead Jewish. When Jewish people are misrepresented as getting ahead in non-Jewish society by having Gentiles murdered, Jewish communities throughout the world have a name for that: they call it ""blood libel."" The myth of Jewish people ritualistically and systematically murdering non-Jews has helped to subjugate and oppress Jewish people in the Western world for centuries. In other words, blood libel has been a strong instrument of anti-Semitism. And we all know what enormities anti-Semitism can lead to. ""Rising Sun"" is just another paranoid blood-libel fantasy, only it substitutes the Japanese into the position of scapegoat historically occupied by the Jews.So, my question for the fans of ""Rising Sun"" is this: If it is anti-Semitic to blood-libel Jewish people -- and I agree that it is -- why isn't it racist to blood-libel Asian people?",N/A
519815,"This was a truly excellent movie, no doubt about it.  Anyone who is still waiting to go see this, should definitely go.  It is a wonderful piece of movie-making and a treat for anyone who loves movies.As a visual rendering of Tolkien's masterwork, Fellowship of the Ring is wonderfully evocative of the spirit of Tolkien, and this, I think, is why Peter Jackson should have won the best director nod from the Oscars.  If ""A Beautiful Mind"" won for subject matter, then LOTR:FoTR was a far better piece of filmic creativity.LoTR is about power, and the way that power corrupts. The task of defeating the greatest and most evil entity in Middle Earth, is destined to fall upon the least conventionally heroic of peoples: the rustic, ""English countryside"" -dwelling hobbits who love food, smoking and running around barefoot.  To save the wiser, more war-like and subtler races of ""the free peoples"" of Middle Earth, Frodo and his servant Sam must overcome evil not by head-on confrontation, but by destroying the Dark Lord Sauron's ultimate source of power: his gold ring.The drama of LoTR cannot be denied, the scenery and the cinematography were breathtaking (the Second Age battles at the beginning of the movie and the over-flights of Saruman's transformation of Isengard particularly stand out)and the action scenes, while a little 'sensationalized' for the video-game audience, were pretty gutsy. The combat scenes in particular had much more of the feel of hand-to-hand fighting than sword and sandal travesties like ""Gladiator"".  That said, I did have a couple of moments of disconnect with the movie.  One was the silly wizards' duel between Gandalf and Saruman.  It looked more like Buffy the Vampire Slayer, than Tolkien.  The other was the petulance of Elrond (although I very much enjoyed Agent Smith's portrayl of the Elf-Lord, he seemed a much less impressive character than he was in the book). Still, in the final analysis, LoTR is not about the individual characters (except Frodo, Sam and Smeagol/Gollum). As a work of literature, and as the ur-father of fantasy novels, it is about big ideas, and this is where (for my money) Peter Jackson's talent really comes through.On one level, LoTR (both the movie and the books) are just good entertaining fun, but on another level, there are deeper and more disturbing issues: As many scholars have pointed out, Tolkien's story was about the denial of power rather than the triumphant use of it. It's a story with deep humanistic (and religious) roots.  Tolkien himself refuted the idea that LoTR was about the atom bomb, but there are more than enough interesting links between Tolkien and Milton for us to see that the central issue for Tolkien was the nature of good and evil and the way in which humanity (via its various avatars - elves, humans, wizards, dwarves, hobbits, and even orcs) come to terms with the demands of both good and evil as guiding forces in the world.  It should be noted in these more multicultural times, that Tolkien's moral universe was a thoroughly English form of Christianity, and a mixture of late 19th century and Dark Ages Christianity at that.One of the most important differences between Tolkien and the more simplistic versions of fantasy that make up the bulk of what came after the publication of 'The Lord of the Rings' is Tolkien's insistence on the inevitability and sadness of endings. Even if the good guys win, much will be sacrificed, and the world as the protagonists know it will come to an end.  This is most evident in his handling of the elves, but also in figures such as  Aragorn who is shown not as a young man, in the glorious morning of adulthood (as he would be in almost any other fantasy author's hands), but as a guy who is definitely a little the worse for wear and tear, even if he can still decapitate orcs with the best of them. This is not Walt Disney's world of primary colors or John Wayne-style westerns with unambiguous good guys and bad guys.In fact, in Tolkien's universe, the good are often hampered by their own deficiencies, or tempted by their own delusions, or disabled by the treachery of erstwhile allies.  The bad guys often unwittingly facilitate their own doom through the same kinds of in-fighting and mutual suspicion.  No one in LoTR has absolute moral clarity, and that, I think is part of Tolkien's creative genius.Through careful casting, camera-work and scripting, Jackson has been able to capture this essential ingredient in Tolkien's Middle Earth.  Cate Blanchett's Galadriel and above all, Ian McKellan's Gandalf embody this to the tips of their boots.  Huge cheers for the whole cast and the technical crew for this movie.  Tolkien's spirit goes on into the new millennium.",The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring
394527,"Hmmm...""The Anniversary."" For some reason, I like this film, though it's neither fish nor fowl. Marketed as a horror movie, in the Bette Davis vein, but actually a snippy ""comedy of manners,"" ""The Anniversary"" is a property desperately in search of an identity. Rest assured, this is Bette's show all the way. She completely and UTTERLY dominates the action, whether snidely putting down a guest (""would you mind sitting somewhere else, dear? Body odor offends me"") or reducing her three grown sons to mounds of jelly, she's in the driver's seat. And that's the problem. No other cast member can even come close to Ms. Davis...and when they attempt to, it's like a flame approaching a hurricane!  Guess who wins! ""The Anniversary"" was a stage play, veddy British in tone, with Mona Washbourne as the dreadful one-eyed mother, Mrs. Taggert. Bette is miscast, sad to say...obviously American, with children and ""loved ones"" who are decidedly British, and it's an odd misstep. Then, there's the lack of a musical score. There's not one note of background music, aside from the credits and the playing of ""The Anniversary Waltz"" on an old victrola. In between the hollering (and there's a lot of that), there's nothing to fill up all those empty pauses.  Perhaps if there'd been a laugh track tacked onto the film, we'd no where to laugh...but honestly, Bette's remarks are so outrageously nasty, it's difficult to find any humor in them. The film just goes on and on, without any real point. Oh, I suppose it's really a twisted essay on ""Mother Love,"" because--in the end--Bette keeps her ""chicks"" close. But none of the ""boys"" are interesting, so why would she want those bores around? There's beleaguered family man Terry, saddled with a constantly pregnant Cockney wife; fat, ineffectual transvestite son Henry (and we never see him don so much as a frilly bathrobe), and the worst of her lot--Austin Powers wannabe, Tom (grungy teeth and all!). So, why, with all this criticism, do I like ""The Anniversary?""  Well, for one, it's a Hammer Film, for another, it's BETTE DAVIS!

243652,"...Watching the DVD I bought from Amazon, I was stunned.The clarity of light on the cars in the famous opening sequence literally shines! There is one other scene in particular where Mastroianni stands in front of a light -- an effect I'm certain Fellini realized -- and you can literally see the light shine from his graying hair. Even the subtitles have been re-done. I can remember looking at the fuzzy subtitles on the VHS and struggling to concentrate. On this Criterion Collection DVD, they are crisp and clear as anything on the market.Most significant to me, though: the commentary section! Though I've watched this film a few times (I can still remember getting chills up my spine the first time I saw the opening sequence) the commentary will blow you away with how complex this 2 hour film is. Though it is a film that is fun enough to watch for its own sake -- the commentary read like a guidebook to Picasso's cubist period, explaining the significance of casting certain characters, various symbols: for example, the watch given to Mastroianni by the Producer in the film echoes Fellini's own producer giving him a watch under similar circumstances after his filming La Dolce Vita. There are many like images and symbols explained. The depth of commentary made this film Ten Times more complex than without -- and yet, even realizing how much more complex and personal this film is, it's still the fun 2 hour film it'll always be! It's just that watching it now is watching a film with thirty years of wisdom packed into one DVD. Amazing. Nina Rota's score is a trip!

474065,"I'm just gonna start right off the bat by saying that Albert Brooks is a comedic genius. There is no arguing that. The man always delivers. His best effort was the recent &quot;Mother&quot;. So, does this film deliver in the brilliant Albert Brooks way?. Well,no. It really doesn't. Is it still a pleasant and charming and humorous film?. Yes. It's just not up to Brooks' standards. In the movie, Brooks stars as Steven, a Hollywood screenwriter who can't seem to get a break, even after winning a prestigious film award. He has a nice home and a beautiful wife(played by Andie MacDowell), and some kids, but his career is floundering. It seems as if the studios aren't helping him much either. Then, his rich best friend(played by Jeff Bridges), lets Steven in on a little secret. He's been using a muse. Someone who inspires creativity in someone. At first, he's unwilling to share his muse with Steven, then gives in when he sees how desperate his buddy is. Steven meets Sarah(Sharon Stone), and it's not all great as he thought it would be. Sarah helps and gives, but expects things in return. Not just things, but nice things. She even moves in with the family!. I won't go into the ending and say what happens, but it is kind of a downer really. I wished it had ended some other way. The movie is light and airy and easily forgettable after a while, but it is smooth going down. Stone has never been more appealing here, even if she does get a little bossy here and there. Brooks is his usual reliable self. The film also has cameos by James Cameron, Martin Scorsesse, Wolfgang Puck, Rob Reiner, and Jennifer Tilly. The scene where Brooks is talking with a foreign man in a restaraunt and he doesn't understand what he is saying is priceless. I laughed hard at that one. The Muse isn't classic Brooks, but it's pleasant enough while we wait for something better.",The Muse
508851,"Sleazy best describes this Fulci slasher about a madman running around New York City killing people (especially pretty ladies) in loving, graphic detail.The killer quacks like a duck.  No joke.  To be honest, the most disturbing thing about this flick is not the gore or any real scares (there are none) but the story behind the childlike quacking, etc.Gore?  Sure.  But you've seen just as good gore in better context and better films.  I have to give MUCH credit to the throat slashing scene where the POV is from INSIDE a victim's throat as it is sliced open, so that we see the killer and then the dripping blood.  Sounds sick and kind of is, but very stylish.  Kudos.Otherwise, we get Jack Hedley, looking like he's killing time between AA meetings or something walking around New York without any real urgency to catch the killer.The film is [inexpensive], low budget, and has that sleazy feel--you know, the one where you feel guilty for having spent 2 hours watching something like this.  But to be honest, you've seen sleaze in more effective films, most notably MANIAC from a couple of years earlier.  At least that film was the story of Joe Spinell and a heck of a creepy performance.This DVD is for Fulci fans for sure.  Otherwise, a rental to the curious.  Oh, and of course, it's infamous.

695376,"I too at first wished to hear more of Joyce's famous comments and phrases (""Ireland, the old sow that eats her farrow""). When he writes ""The Dead"" I'd hoped to hear the glorious final paragraph about flakes falling into the mutinous Shannon. And so on. But this was a filming of Brenda Maddox's book, not a gathering of Joyce writings. The point of ""The Dead"" in the film is to light up Joyce's compulsive jealousy of ""Gabriel"", Nora's first lover, not show how that lover later splintered into Blazes Boylan. The Joyce here begins as the callow Stephen Dedalus figure, then matures into a much weightier character with a genius for honesty who must never avoid the worst in human nature and, indeed, must hold it dear as a source of inspiration--even if he finds it in his wife. Dublin has bleached him white and he must write the gray prose of ""Dubliners"" to match his feelings, and then the photographically gray prose of ""Ulysses"". Earlier films had already dramatized Joyce's prose, Joseph Strick's ""Ulysses"" and John Huston's ""The Dead""--so why repeat what had already been done? Furthermore, when Joyce complains that Nora never reads his stories, she cries back, Why should I when I see how you twist my life in them? So Joyce's prose is not part of Nora's mind, not even the lovely end of ""The Dead""--so it would be out of place in Nora's universe in this film, as would her reactions to any sublime prose moment. We don't want to see Nora saying what a wonderful writer Jimmy is--although in later life she did enjoy the world's opinion of her husband. I found Ewan McGregor fighting against body type in trying to capture the slender figure of Joyce but that at times he did catch the Joyce silhouette balanced on his cane. McGregor's lighting was splendid, with artful shadows at times molding Joyce's features and even reaching into his head to see Joyce's cold gray torment. Since the film ends before ""Dubliners"" is even published--or rather with the type being smashed by the printers--there can be no reason for working some of Joyce's later writing or glories into the the script. The focus is on Nora, and Susan Lynch, also working against body type in trying to figure forth a robust Nora, does wonderfully. She may never again have as great a role to play. The film successfully plays Nora's burly richness of feeling against Joyce's complexity and writerly distraction snd I for one loved it. Let me add that as I watched it, alas on tape, I kept thinking ""Here is a film that will never earn back its costs--except emotionally for what Stendahl calls 'the happy few.'""

I may be inclined to agree with them.While not my favorite, it has beauty and versitiliy that I've seen nowhere else in anime, or in anything. Neon Genesis Evangelion is an undoubtably serious story, with lots of focus on the phychology of the characters, each of which are painfully real in their faults. From Shinji's immaturity and insecurity, to the seeming apathy of Mr. Ikari, Evangelion doesn't present you with a world where the heroes are virtuous do-no-wrong characters, but instead an almost believable world.It doesn't limit itself to that though, Evangelion goes much farther. It has some lighthearted features, like Misato's house with her ""hot springs penguin"" Pen-pen. It has building relationships, between NERV members, as well as Shinji and his classmates.It's very original too, even though on the surface it looks like another giant robot anime, it obviously isn't. While the fighting can be very well choreographed, you can see that it isn't just empty fighting between good and evil; you can see that the Evas battling the angels are just used as a medium for creating an unforgettable story about people.The subtitled format (optional of course, when you have a DVD), can be a little hard to follow at times.

27063,"&quot;Well, he won't be doing the crossword tonight!&quot;&quot;Do you know what the most frightening thing in the world is ...?&quot;This is somewhat of a landmark film in that it was well made and truly disturbing. Those two things had not really made it to films together before this gem came along. But unfortunately for the director Michael Powell, it also brought about the end of his career as a director. Make a scary movie that is effective and realistic? The nerve! Lets blacklist him and make sure he never does it again!It did however pave the way for fellow director Alfred Hitchcock's Psycho which came out a few months later. Without Peeping Tom to have blazed the trail the same fate to some degree may have befallen Hitchcock.The story is about a reclusive man, Mark Lewis (Karlheinz B&ouml;hm), who works as a cameraman for a movie studio during the day, and by night films things with his hand held movie camera. What his tastes for filming have turned to lately have been the looks on women's faces as they are being murdered.A woman in the building he lives in, Vivian (Moira Shearer), takes a fancy to him and starts getting him to go out occasionaly. They hit it off but Vivians mother, a blind woman who is so good at using her other senses that she can tell who is standing outside their window, has her doubts about Vivians new love interest. In one incredible scene there is a confrontation between her and Mark that is terrifying to watch.It almost has the feel of a who-dunnit except that we know exactly who-dunnit from the start. The detectives in the movie are putting together the clues that take them closer to Mark and and the tension that is built around them and between Mark and Vivian and her mother becomes intense as the movie progresses.The ending, although less shocking 40 years after the movie was released, still left me somewhat drained and empty. A certain amount of sympathy is built up for Mark and there are hopes that he can be redeemed. But I won't tell any more of what happens, you will just have to rent or buy the movie.This is part of the Criterion Collection and horror/drama fans and dvd enthusiasts alike will not be dissapointed.

Of course Hamilton is transformed is not only disgusted with his choice and tries not to correct his prior life but to correct himself. This is what makes this an ecellent film! Hammilton never tries to reconsrtuct his former life that was filled with a wife and family but just to reconsrtuct himself never wanting to fully &quot;complete&quot; himself. He does want to under go another surgery though so he can find some sort of balance-sohe can make himself a little more respectable. But when he returns to the organization he finds that his life and soul are as expandable as he thought of his former life. Haunghting and thrilling to the bitter end &quot;Seconds&quot;, leaves the viewer not only thinking about looking past beauty but thinking about why we ever looked at it in the first place!

720862,"Okay, I'll try to be balanced here. This movie was terrible. I know a lot of people were disappointed in H20 because it is far too similar stylistically to the post-Scream slasher movies, and some because it abandons the storyline of Halloweens 4-6. However, I think that was the correct thing to do seeing as the wider audience is far more familiar with the Jamie Lee Curtis story, which showed in the box office for H2O.So, three years later, plus an extra one because of production problems, we have Resurrection. And was it worth the wait? Absolutely not. And here's why!The Jamie Lee Curtis cameo was the most ill-conceived idea since they killed off James T. Kirk in a cameo in Star Trek: Generations. We had 20 years and three movies of build-up to the event that was motivating this killer, and they deliver the most insulting anti-climax since the aforementioned demise of one starship captain. And what's worse, it's the best 10 minutes of this movie. I don't lay this blame entirely with one party, because what was an ill-conceived idea was then filmed very badly by Rick Rosenthal, and then edited even more slopily in post production. Jamie Lee Curtis should have used her contracted obligatory appearance for something much more  useful, like having Myers searching for her the whole movie and then she appears at the end. That would have worked much better. Besides which, Laurie's 'death' is highly ambiguous, given that she is stabbed once and falls from the roof, landing softly on the tree tops. I must admit, that is perhaps the best shot of the movie, but it doesn't totally convince you of anything really. After all, look at dear old Dr Loomis. He burned, he was thrown through a window, he was stabbed, he had a fatal heart attack, and then something incoherent happens to him at the end of H6. And you KNOW he would have been in H2O if Donald Pleasance were still alive.Anyway, moving along... to the score, or rather, to an acceptable version of John Carpenter's classic theme (although how many more 'variations' on that I can take, I don't know). I struggled to pick out any decent new cues throughout the entire film, or to be more accurate, any cues at all! Not a good sign. They might as well have just replaced it with some of Marco Beltrami's score from Scream, as they did in H20.Basically, there is just no point to this story. The reality TV/internet broadcast thing is two years past its sell by date, besides which it was done much better in  My Little Eye this year. It completely undermines the whole story behind the Halloween movies, whether you prefer the H1,2,4,5,6 or H1,2,H2O,8 path. After finally dispensing with his sister (until H40!) all he seems to do is a spot of housework.And cutting past the chase to the denouement, Resurrection also has perhaps the [worst] final scene in the whole series. At least the mess at the end of H6 left you wondering what...had happened. Not Resurrection. No, sir...",Halloween: Resurrection
341338,"This movie is one of the funniest movies I've ever seen. Joyce Hyser (what happened to her, anyway?) did a great job playing male and female ""Terry.""Her brother, played by Billy Jacoby was a total goofball and one of the funniest characters in the whole movie!

298776,"I really am amazed that anyone can find something positive about this awful travesty, let alone pick out poor Sophia Copolla for derision - there are far more fundamentally awful things about this movie than her merely unremarkable performance, believe me! The film gives the impression of an entirely strange director finding the abandonned clothes of the first two films and putting them on himself - it really is like that, a peculiar, rather 'off' imitation of someone you know and love. Music, set pieces, themes, characters are all shamelessly rehashed from the first two parts - and honestly to what end? What more about Michael, his life and his family legacy do we learn that we didn't already know? No ending could more definitively convey the shattering of a man's life through his actions' impact on others close to him than the silent coda to Part II (to my mind without doubt one of the top 5 greatest American films), certainly not the overblown operatic hysteria we have here, nor the unintentionally almost comic re-hash of that original spine-tingling moment that ends this film. Copolla was clearly aiming at a certain 'operatic' look and feel in many aspects of the film, but the end results are so ham-fisted in places as to be close to laughable; a good example being poor Talia Shire's bizarre turn as a sort of black-clad Queen of the Night. Dialogue between the Mafiosi is so cliched and leaden in places as to be simply unbelievable any more. The 'borrowings' from the first two films are just too blatant and purposeless to be anything other than irritating; Eli Wallach's character (extraordinarily over-acted), the older father figure who is secretly trying to betray Michael, is a transparent re-hash of Hyman Roth; We have an assasination in the midst of the feast of St Genero and so on and so forth. The two strands of the film, Michael's attempt at legitimacy and redemption and the fact-based dubious shennanigans at the Vatican Bank never really gel either, in such contrast to Part II in which the themes of personal and institutional corruption were seamless. It's possible that there was a film to be made about Michael Corleone's later life - it's true that his torment at the end of Part II does leave the door open - but if there was, it needed a much more original approach than this overblown farago offers.","The Godfather, Part III Final Director's Cut  VHS"

But instead of deciding to tell Masamune Shirow's epic story in a series of films, the producers decided to pack hundreds of pages of manga into a 2 hour feature with slick production values.What's even worse is that Shirow's characters are drawn and animated by other people! His great artistic style is not at all present here. If you have ever seen the &quot;Ghost in the Shell&quot; PlayStation game, you've seen Ghost in the Shell as animated by Masamune Shirow. That is what this film should have looked like.Roger Ebert and James Cameron gave this film two thumbs up, but it's doubtful they read the source manga.

712610,"""Space 1999"", a 1970's sci-fi television series that lasted for two seasons, was the brainchild of Gerry & Sylvia Anderson, previously known for their TV productions of ""UFO"" and ""The Thunderbirds"".  The primary plot of ""Space 1999"" was that Earth's moon is blasted into an unknown trajectory into deep space by an accidental supermassive explosion.  The explosion resulted from a build-up radiation within stockpiles of radioactive waste that had been ferried to the moon during several preceding years.  A manned lunar base, called Moonbase Alpha, was also constructed where scientists, technicians and other personnel monitored the two radioactive waste disposal areas.  The 311 people assigned to Alpha survive the explosion.  Their commander, John Keonig (Martin Landau) decides shortly thereafter that attempting a return to Earth would be more dangerous than remaining on Alpha, so Alpha's crew never sees home again.  During its two seasons, the moon travels past many inhabited worlds and Alpha's crew studies each one closely as a possible place to build new homes and lives.There are several basic physical problems with the basis of the plot.  First, it is far more likely that an explosion that could hurl the moon out of Earth orbit would instead destroy the moon and a rain of dangerous meteors would cause considerable damage on Earth. A ring of debris would also encircle the Earth similar to the rings of Saturn.Second, since there was an explosion, there would have been a massive crater and debris, but any views of the moon from space on ""Space 1999"" never show a massive crater resulting from the radioactive waste explosion.  Early news reports from Earth make no mention of debris raining down on the Earth from the explosion.Third, it is highly unlikely that a single explosion would have sufficient force to propel the moon at speeds necessary to traverse interstellar distances in a few months.  Earth's nearest interstellar neighbor, Alpha Centauri, is more than 4 light years away. A craft would need to travel 24 times the speed of light to reach Alpha Centauri within 2 months.  Ships in ""Star Trek"" routinely travel much faster than the speed of light, but they do so in a much more believable manner than the scenario created in ""Space 1999"".Fourth, if the moon is traveling faster than light, how could the Eagle spacecraft, which presumably only travel slower than light, be able to visit other planets before the moon zips past them?  If they left the moon, they would never be able to return.  The only answer is that the moon also mysteriously decelerates to mere sub-light speeds whenever it approaches habitable planets.  This gives Alpha's crew the opportunity to visit, before the moon subsequently accelerates back to its previous faster-than-light velocity in time to reach other habitable worlds for future episodes.  No natural force exists that could do this.Fifth, the population of Alpha when it leaves Earth orbit is only 311 people.  In the first season alone, at least 1 or 2 people die in each episode.  With only one known birth during the first season, at least 10% of Alpha's total population would be dead. At the beginning of the second season, Helena Russell (Barbara Bain) says that over 1100 days have elapsed since the moon left Earth, but Alpha's crew is not 30-40% smaller; nor are there any children.Sixth, since Alpha's crew is completely cut off from friends & family on Earth, morale should be a major concern. Unfortunately, few of the 48 episodes ever focused on character development or the reality of crew's complete isolation.  Instead, everyone appears to be relatively happy and many of the regular characters are only seen at their desks in Alpha's control room, Main Mission.  Few love affairs are ever shown and little, if any, recreational activities.  The atmosphere on Alpha is mostly sterile, boring and psychologically unrealistic.  The Anderson's devoted a lot of time to developing the characters of Ed Straker and Col. Foster on ""UFO"", but little is ever known about the personal lives of John Keonig, Helena Russell or any other ""Space 1999"" character.Seventh, ""Space 1999"" never depicts the dangers of ferrying radioactive waste to the moon for burial. It would be disastrous if any rocket containing waste crashed during or shortly after takeoff.  Also, costs would be enormous and environmentalists would be protesting.I enjoyed ""Space 1999"" as a child, but I don't enjoy it as much now.  I believe the Andersons would have done far better to keep their original idea: to create a second season of the much more believable series ""UFO"" instead of abandoning its plot to create ""Space 1999"".  ""Space 1999"" had a massive budget and its sets and special effects were far better than any previous Anderson production. However, lack of character development and unbelievable science prevented the series from achieving the same audience and popularity that shows such as ""Star Trek"" and ""Babylon 5"" still have.Picture and sound quality on the ""Space 1999"" DVD's is very good.  Some longer scenes that were not originally aired in the U.S. don't always maintain the same high picture & sound quality.  If you are thinking of purchasing several individual 2-DVD sets of ""Space 1999"", you would be better off buying the entire Megaset of all 16 DVD's because it will probably be cheaper. Otherwise, just rent them as I have been doing.",N/A

589959,"Over the years, Robert Altman has proved as elusive as his films to classify or to try to get the definitive pulse from. His films are at once quite focused and yet all over the place. The predominating feature of each of the films is that it is an attempt to define and describe a kind of insane little aspect of the world, as in ""MASH"", ""The Player"", or  ""Nashville"".  He seems intrigued by the way in which earnestness and sophistry pass through the lens of every observer, so that while we believe we are viewing something in all due reference, he is poking fun at our attempt. Yet he is still standing there next to us, peering through that same small knothole and straining to try to understand whatever it is that is going inside that small space we can see beyond the wooden wall.For Altman, life is messy and hard to discern, and a lot of the dialogue in his films suffer from the same level of noise and discord. Yet no one seems as uniquely capable at capturing all of the noisome nuances of human interaction in its full range of pathos and progress than does Altman. As in MASH, his depiction of the nature of life in an English ""cottage"" is a masterpiece of such imaginings. The cast here is superb, including Maggie Smith, Jeremy Northam, and Kristin Scott Thomas as the rulers of this limited universe, as well as others such as Kelly MacDonald, Alan Bates, Helen Mirren, and Clive Owen as the working class stiffs just trying to scheme their way through the day.Altman pokes great fun at both sides of the socioeconomic divide, and it is the nature of the class-ordained behavior that provides the foundation for this look at life in the English countryside. While it has commonly been observed before that a hard a difficult life has its rewards, especially allowing for a more realistic appreciation of the gifts of life, never has it been done so gracefully, imaginatively, and with such roaring good humor and repartee as here.  Certainly, Altman's fondness for noise and chaos furthers this search for the truth in the situation as nothing else could. The film is entertaining, worthwhile, and extremely well done. I highly recommend it. Enjoy!",N/A

329326,"Much as I love Tarkovsky, and I deeply love three of his movies, I really hate this one. It is boring and silly. In fact it could well lay claim to be the most boring film ever made. The script is nothing much and the usual device of poems seems forced this time. First cringe is the transition from sepia to colour upon entering the zone thus conjuring unfavourable comparisans to 'The Wizard Of Oz'. Unfortunately, the Stalker's wife does not enliven the proceedings with her version of 'Over The Rainbow', deciding instead to roll around the floor of her hovel with belly ache. Originally, the producers of 'Oz' left out that song because they didn't want to delay Dorothy's journey. In 'Stalker' they don't much care if the protagonists are held up or if they don't move at all, so a song might have been nice. Actually, some Can-Can dancers would have been especially welcome.Once in the zone, our three cheerful chums do pretty much what we all did around derelict building sites and forests as a kid, which is to bicker, roll around on the floor and chuck metal objects at each other. Thanks for the nostalgia trip. Well, maybe not. Someone chucks something into a steel well. Plink. Remember that too? They find a skeleton and this reminds me of an amusing production anecdote in which a newly arrived crew member on the set either sat on, or placed something on the skeleton, squashing it. The budget didn't extend to making a new skeleton so the poor crew member was dispatched to the railway station, presumably for a very drawn out and excrutiatingly boring wait for a rural train. Tarkovsky later relented however, true humanitarian that he was. Actually, it's not that amusing an anecdote, I'm just worried this review is getting boring. Which it is. So to make things even more boring we only get to see half a skeleton because of the damage. Pity, they could have tied some string to the original and had it do Stanislavski's greatest hits, or failing that, the Can-Can.Tarkovsky railed against the lack of sacrifice people were willing to make in today's materialist culture but the long walk through the catacombs of the building betrays an almost priggish sadism, especially as the writer doing the walking then sits down for ten minutes and whinges about his publishers. Then in one of many naff moments, the writer wears a crown of thorns presumably because he doesn't want to be beaten by the Stalker in a 'Baldest on Building Site' competition. Sadly this man has the unfortunate distinction of being the least disappearing visitor to the zone, thus, to our ultimate existential horror, returning to the outside world to bore some more.The one saving grace is the intriguing and beautifully shot ending which bumps up some much needed stars for the film.Incredibly, 'Stalker' was a remake, the original version allegedly spoiled by obstructive lab technicians. Or could it be that God was trying to tell you something, Andrei? After all, if he'd put us on the earth to be bored out of our minds, would he have given us Formula One racing driving? Actually, I can't stand that either, bad example.On a sadder note, it was speculated that this film caused Tarkovsky and some of the crew to suffer an early demise from cancer because of the Communist block's disastrous environmental policies concerning industrial waste of which 'The Zone' was an alleged dumping ground.",Stalker VHS
581578,"One evening in the spring of 2000, I was at the movies and saw a poster for Things You Can Tell Just by Looking at Her. What an interesting title, I thought. And what a cast! I put the movie on my mental list of ones I planned to see. It never played at that theater. It never played in any theater in North America, although it was released in Europe, South America and Japan. Instead, it was sold to a big cable TV movie channel. MGM decided that it was too small a film for American audiences. I think their decision was unfortunate. Many movies intended for a limited audience have successful theatrical runs, and as so-called small movies go, this is an awfully big one. I hope it finds the audience it deserves on video.Things You Can Tell Just by Looking at Her does not have a conventional plot. It is five stories or vignettes loosely tied together. As the title implies, they are about women. In the first one, Glenn Close plays a doctor who is successful in her professional life but not in her personal oen. Her rather cold exterior masks the fact that she is starved for affection. It is Close's best role in years. Next we meet Rebecca [Holly Hunter], a bank manager on the edge of forty, whose almost casual decision to have an abortion leads to unexpected emotional complications. There is Rose [Kathy Baker], a single Mom who writes children's books and who does her best at raising her precocious fifteen year old son. She finds herself attracted to her new next-door neighbor, a smart and confident guy who just happens to be a dwarf. Christie [Calista Flockheart] and Lilly [Valeria Golino] are lovers facing one of life's toughest battles. Finally, there is the tale of Carol [Cameron Diaz], a blind woman who understands and 'sees' life much more clearly than her repressed sister, Kathy [Amy Brenneman].None of these stories may sound like much, but the success of a story always lies in its telling. Director Rodrigo Garcia is a master story teller. He never lets the movie drift into melodrama. The characters and the subject matters could easily lend themselves to titillation and to cheap thrills, but in the hands of this masterful director, we see these characters simply as people doing the best they know how to do despite their handicaps, both physical and emotional. This movie is very human, and that's fairly rare these days.The cast, of course, is a remarkable group of actors. It is amazing to see them all together in one movie. What truly impressed me was the fact that all of them seems to have outdone themselves. While some of their roles are not large, I cannot think of an instance in which any of them have given a better performance. For acting buffs, the film is a rare treat.When we refer to a movie as small, I think we generally mean one that does not get the adrenaline flowing. If so, Things You Can Tell Just by Looking at Her certainly fits the description. Anyone addicted to explosions, car chases and pumped up characters mindlessly spewing profanities will want to avoid this one. Those who like a little heart and soul, not to mention some intelligence, in their movies should find this one to be a rare treat.",Things You Can Tell Just By Looking at Her VHS

I liked the movie maybe too much; I found myself redoing parts and thinking about how to embed it in a longer movie that would show the characters before and after.""Breakfast"" (""Fruestueck""; Alexander Pfeuffer; Germany; 14 minutes) has romantic, Berlin newcomer Boris (Nico Link) trying to keep a hold on impulsive, promiscuous Till (Tobias Schenke). Till's friend, Giselle (Anna Thalbach), offers breakfasts.  Can they help?  This is a nice, romantic comedy.""Touch"" (Jeremy Podeswa; Canada; 27 minutes) is the most serious and, for me, the most memorable of the six films.  A boy is locked in a basement and abused from the time he is eight years old until he is sixteen.  When the doors open, the boy is free to leave.  Upon leaving a hospital, he is given a name and lives with foster parents.  Not given any further treatment, his past continues to drive his future.  Brendan Fletcher gives an amazing performance as the sixteen-year old ""Richard"".  The grainy photography fits well with the deadened sensibility and the shadowy faces used.  Daniel Janke's dissonant music for violin and prepared piano fits perfectly and is performed well by pianist Janke and by violinist Mark Fewer.  Five stars out of five.""Take-Out"" (Jean-Francois Monette; Canada; 37 minutes) was sponsored by Quebec and features road signs in French, although the characters all speak English.  High school student Rory (Gianpaolo Venuta) delivers chicken dinners for Chalet Bar-B-Q.  One day he delivers to Pete (Daniel MacIvor), a lawyer in a big house and with time on his hands.  Rory keeps being asked back, and the tips keep getting bigger.  Fellow worker Enzo (Benjamin Plener) and Pete's wife(?) Virginia (Kaya McGregor) are starting to ask questions.  Rory has wandering eyes in the school shower and is looking at some interesting magazines in the rack.  What happens next?  This was the most finished looking movie of the lot and had fine acting throughout.  There were parts worth reconsidering on repeat viewings.The biggest drawback to the DVD was that there were no director's commentaries to any of the movies.  I enjoy commentaries as a way to learn about movie-making and about how other cultures handle matters.  Another annoyance was that the first three movies do not show linkages between the actors' names and the parts they play; one can try to guess by who appears first or speaks first or is the most important.Still, this is a very enjoyable collection of films from outside the USA.",Boys Briefs 2

703108,"To those of you familiar with the books of H P Lovecraft this film should need little introduction.  That is apart from the need to know that the time frame of this film has been updated to our time which for all intents and purposes adds rather than detracts from the overall creepiness.  The plot can be found in the reviews below mine of which some stupidly give too much away which is strange for a forum like this that should be used to promote a cult film such as this otherwise we may not see its like again.  I mean lets face it, once you know major plot spoilers it does ruin a film and may stop potential purchasers.  Which would be a shame as originals in the field of cinema such as Stuart Gordon and Brian Yuzna should be allowed at least the grace of letting their movies be seen by as wide an audience as possible.  This film was the one they had waited years to make before finally getting the green light to produce as faithful an adaption of Lovecrafts work as possible.  And that is really all that needs to be said - if you love/like H P Lovecrafts work this is the nearest you will get to it on screen.  If you've never heard of him but like intelligent horror with a healthy side order of black humour and gore then you will appreciate this just as much.  Its just a pity that this film will sink without trace when put up against the redundant teen slasher flicks and pointless remakes/sequels of an already long dead genre.",Dagon
390652,"Roger Corman vented forth this weird and weirdly funny little movie that became a cult classic the minute it hit theatre screens in the 1960s.  The story, of course, has been made famous by the later New York musical and the film it spawned: an incompetent floral shop worker grows a plant so weird looking that it boosts business at his employer's skid-row shop; trouble is, the plant requires regular feeding, and its food of choice is whatever body part happens to be, er, handy!Mel Welles, who plays Mushnick, is very entertaining, and Jack Nicholson makes his screen debut with a really wild performance as the masochistic dental patient, but for the most part the cast is no-name; likewise the production values are non-existant, and print quality is mediocre at best.  The script, however, is rather witty, taking swipes at everything from hypocondria to garden club ladies to television's DRAGNET.  The whole thing is extremely uneven, but that's part of the charm.  Some viewers will find the joke isn't as funny in execution as it is in concept, and the film tends to drag a bit toward the end, but cult film fans are sure to love it!",The Little Shop of Horrors VHS
743754,"No one can ever say that Spike Lee's films aren't at the very least interesting or at best, brilliant. ""25th Hour,"" his newest film is in the former category.""25th Hour"" tells the story of Monty Brogan who has approx 24 hours until he must report to prison for a term of 7 years for selling drugs. We are privy to what is going on in Monty's (named after Montgomery Clift...nice touch) mind as well what is actually happening in his physical world: his relationship with his girlfriend, Naturelle (Rosario Dawson), his father (Brian Cox) and his two close friends Frank (Barry Pepper) and Jakob (Phillip Seymour Hoffman).""25th Hour"" was written by David Benioff; adapted from his novel. What is missing from the screenplay and the film is motivation: why does Monty sell drugs? It is obvious from where he lives and what he drives that drug dealing has been profitable for him, but why does an obviously intelligent, well-spoken man go down that particular path? Is it for the thrill, is he just lazy, does he like what the money buys? We never know for sure. As viewers we can fill in some of the gaps from the evidence presented onscreen, but there are too many gaps in ""25th Hour"" and not enough stuff with which to fill them.Edward Norton tries his best to make us care and in a way we do, for Norton can, like almost no other actor working today, elicit a positive response: he is stalwart and tough and yet extremely sensitive but ultimately self-absorbed as Monty and we can't help but empathize with him.There are several half-hearted attempts to tie in the 9/11 tragedy with Monty's plight: Frank and Jakob having a conversation while viewing the devastation for one.  Lee is obviously grief stricken over 9/11, as we all are, but these scenes feel tacked-on and more to the point since Monty is mostly only interested in Monty this stab at universality feels false and gratuitous.The physical production is gorgeous, though from Rodrigo Prieto's images of NYC and Brooklyn to Terence Blanchard's evocative music.Spike Lee has given us several of the most accomplished and wonderful films ever committed to celluloid: think ""Malcolm X"" or ""Do the Right Thing."" But ""25th Hour"" lacks Lee's cohesive, corrosive and incendiary wit and intelligence and therefore fails to ignite our passion or our hearts.",N/A
556616,"Wow. After I finished Trigun, I did not expect any other anime to meet its caliber. The story, the music, the characters; they all complemented each other perfectly.I began to watch Cowboy Bebop after I began to save more money. I had heard much praise from many anime publications and otaku before and it was hard for me to believe the incredible hype. But that all changed when I put in the DVD and watched it. First Volume 1. Then 2. Then 3. Till I saw it all.The story revolves around 4 (5 if you count Ein the Data Dog!) central characters. Jet Black, an ex member of the Inter Solar Systems Police with a cybernetic arm due to a shady event in his past. Faye Valentine, a sexy woman in incalculable debt and an unknown history. Ed, a 13 year-old super-hacker extraordinaire. Last but not least, Spike Spiegel, a laid-back twenty-something that has incredible flight skills and fighting talent with a tragic past.Almost all the episodes are independent but a couple include bits and pieces of a character's past. These can range from being very comedic, cryptic, action-packed, or dramatic. The beauty of it all is how all the episodes seem to be unrelated yet are all strung together with an invisible thread, all building to the final climax(es if you refer to each character's resolve).This 6th and final 'session' is probably my favorite. 'Brain Scratch,' the first episode on the disc, is alright but cannot compare to the emotional roller-coaster ahead. 'Hard-Luck Woman' deals with the discovery of Faye's past as well as Ed's. However, the real highlight of this DVD are episodes 25 and 26: ""The Real Folk Blues Part 1 and 2."" Spike, after years of searching, is finally reunited with his lost love Julia. But with Vicious, Spike's one-time friend, not far behind, will the couple enjoy a happy ending or will it all come to a bittersweet end?With amazing character designs from Yoji Shinkawa (Metal Gear Solid 2) and a diverse and touching score by Yoko Kanno (Escaflowne), this is one anime you cannot miss.From the shadowy start to the awe-inspiring conclusion, Cowboy Bebop has set a benchmark in anime for all those to come.",N/A

422401,"Breaking the Waves, written and directed by Lars Von Trier Dancer in The Dark is a film with such poignant sentiment. The 1996 dramatic movie is about the confines of strict religion, mental illness, confusion, prostitution, and the power of love and healing.Bess McNeil, deeply loves, obsesses and marries Jan (pronounced Yan) an oil rig worker. When an accident brings him back paralyzed, presumably forever, her pure nave innocent and childlike happiness takes an unspeakable turn with devastating consequences. Emily Watson gives a persuasive portrayal as Bess; veteran actor Stellan Skarsgard plays her husband Jan; and Dodo Katrin Cartlidge is excellent as her real true friend and sister-in-law.Jan convinced of his demise, unable to make love to Beth and orders her to have sex with other men and to come back and tell him about it. This, he says, is the only way he can make love to her and to further stipulate, he says he will die if she doesn't.There aren't any clear answers as to why Jan asks his wife to do this. Is he delusional, perverted, or does he really feel Bess will be better without him? Does Jan really love Bess so much that he is willing to set her free, or is he thinking of only himself when he embarks his innocent wife into hell, cast out from the church, her family, the town. Is he telling the truth when he believes he can make love to his wife via another man's pleasure. Does he sincerely realize that Bess is mentally incapable of handling this request? Did he realize where she was going, what might happen to her? We don't get those answers.During chronological sequence breaks, you will hear the soundtrack - songs from the 70's, Jethro Tull's Cross Eyed Mary, Procol Harum's Whiter Shade of Pale, Elton John Your Song, Yellow Brick Road.  The music is set to picturesque scenes.Same as von Trier's Dancer in the Dark, the camera angle can have that dizzying effect especially when it pans the length of a room.  You'll adjust as this intriguing conflicting plot develops. Again, the movie is long, two hours. There is graphic sex and nudity, both male and female. It isn't advisable for younger audiences. If you have seen ""Dancer in the Dark"" you will again be mesmerized by this complex emotional and moving film. ...Rizzo",N/A
153390,"I BURY THE LIVING is a true lost gem.  It covers so many areas in such a short time that you can't help but be impressed by the sheer scope (and speed) of it.  It skips from outright horror, to a tension filled thriller, to a downward spiral into insanity, all coming to a head with a PERRY MASON like reveal all capped off with a TWILIGHT ZONE twist.  A top notch affair that rarely loses its hold on viewer (the 50's typical romantic subplot is the only thing that drags the story here).  For fans of THE SIMPSONS this film also features the possible template for Grounds Keeper Willie in the grounds keeper for the cemetary - uncanny.  I BURY THE LIVING from top to bottom is a classic and a must for any collector of the genre.  For the casual buyer, you could do worse than having this effective and watchable chiller in your collection.",N/A
665992,"The star of this piece is Mark Byers, the stepfather of one of the murdered boys.  The 1st documentary left us with the question of whether he could have been the murderer instead of the 3 young men who were convicted. This sequel is dominated by that idea and Byers is a clearly psychotic man, under the influence of at least 5 psychotropic prescriptions, who was more than willing to perform for a fee paid by the filmmakers.  Frankly, without Byers, I don't think a full length documentary about why the 3 young men are still in prison, would have captured as much interest.  Is there reasonable doubt about the guilt of those men?  Oh, yes, and that was present in film #1.  In fact, the West Memphis, Arkansas police force's methodology for handling forensic evidence rivals the LAPD's handling of the same in the OJ Simpson case. Incompetency seems to be a job qualification in West Memphis both for the police department and the judiciary.  However, I am troubled by the filmmakers paying Mark Byers to perform for them. He does give us a villainous performance that is chilling and eerie.  He reminds me of Robert Mitchum's character in the ""The Hunter,"" as the evangelical minister tracking two children.  It is possible that Byers is the killer.  It may even be probable.  However, because of the incompetence used with the forensic evidence, any murder case will probably remain incapable of being proved beyond a reasonable doubt against Byers or anyone else.  I think the first documentary was a great deal more objective and didn't rely on using Byers as the lead actor or character of the piece.  I was convinced that a gross injustice had been done the 3 young men and this film merely shows that still, at this late date, that injustice continues.",N/A
689824,"Marc Forster's &quot;Monster's Ball&quot; contains a host of horrific deeds and actions in its' first 40 minutes...so many in fact, I almost walked out of the theater: child abuse, attempted patricide, suicide, public execution, racial hatred to name several. I felt like yelling at the screen:  ENOUGH ALREADY!  But a morbid fascination with where this movie was going made me stay in my seat, mouth open...and I can honestly say that ultimately &quot;Monster's Ball&quot; proved to be worth my time and effort.But,the big question here is:  why show so much negativity? Does so much downbeat material make for an uplifting, or more importantly interesting movie experience? Does: &quot;I'm so down...it looks like up to me&quot; apply here? Why have your main character,Hank Grotowski (Billy Bob Thornton) exhibit such self-loathing and hatred and thereby making him unpalatable as a hero?  And ultimately does Hank's metamorphosis into a loving person make sense?I don't have all the answers but I certainly do have impressions and can attest to the cumulative power of the images presented.  Hanks's conversion from bigot to loving, caring human being and Leticia's (Halle Berry)lover doesn't make logical sense but we are rooting for &quot;them&quot; to work and so when it does we believe it. Hank and Leticia are two lost souls, at the end of their psychic ropes, whose only hope for survival is each other.  And so they cling and they claw and they gravitate towards each other as only the desperate are wont to do.  As Leticia says to Hank in as heartbreaking a way as possible, and after years of being tread upon and beaten down: &quot;I need you to take care of me.&quot;Much has been said of Halle Berry's performance and it is a wonder: frustrated, down-and-out, sexually repressed, needy, tired and worn out but always exhibiting the smallest kernel of hope. Billy Bob Thornton wakes up from his zombie-like performance in &quot;The Man Who Wasn't There&quot; and makes Hank a living breathing character...fantastically flawed yet seemingly capable of turning his life around.&quot;Monster's Ball&quot; will be a hard watch for many people and it's flaws might be enough to turn people off but ultimately it is a profoundly even perversely powerful film...not for everyone but for the few who can appreciate the redemptive power of LOVE.",Monster's Ball
292871,"*Oddly enough, there is still some confusion over Sam Raimi's (''Is It A 'Sequel?'; Is It A 'Remake?'; Is It A 'Requel?'; Is It A 'Semake?''') movie, ''Evil Dead II.'' This confusion is not entirely unwarrented, however.The assigning of the number ''two'' in the film's title automatically suggests that the film is a sequel (i.e., a 'second chapter' in a continuing saga). However, the events which take place between both films make it patently obvious that ''ED2'' is NOT a sequel.In the first film, main characters Ashley and his girlfriend Linda arrive at the cabin with his sister and a couple of friends, everyone [except?/including? Ash] dies, and the ''Book of the Dead'' is destroyed in the fire. If ''Evil Dead II'' was intended to be a sequel to the first film, then who relocated the cursed isolated cabin atop a dizzyingly high cliff, and just how crazy would Ashley have to be in order to return there, where he either nearly lost his life or completely lost it before his miraculous resurrection, and how crazy would his resurrected girlfriend Linda have to be for tagging along with him back to the place where she was possessed by the evil undead and decapitated only to be repossessed and decapitated again, and why would she receive the same necklace and charm she had already received earlier and act all ga-ga as though she were receiving it for the very first time? And just how did the previously destroyed ''Book of the Dead'' suddenly rematerialize? It could all happen only if ''ED2'' was NOT a sequel.What is it, then? Is the movie's title a ''play-on-words''-- i.e., ''The Evil Dead, TOO'' --meaning that the film is a ''remake?'' No, because, again, despite the many similarities between the two films (including the ''return'' of two key characters: Ashley and Linda), the overall theme, pacing, and introduction of a whole new set of supporting characters totally rule out any idea of this film's simply being a remake of an original. The title's inclusion of the number ''two'' is also clear indication that this film is something other than a remake.So what's going on? How does one make sense of this seeming paradox brought about by these two radically similar yet radically dissimilar films?I cannot begin to speak on behalf of the films' creator(s), but I personally find clarity in the titles of the two films. ''The Evil Dead'' is the ''official'' version of the film -- in other words, ''ED1'' is ''THE'' Evil Dead movie; ''Evil Dead TWO'' is actually the ''SECOND VERSION'' of ''The Evil Dead'' ... i.e., it is a ''NEW INTERPRETATION'' of the ''official'' film: Therefore, ''&Eacute;D2'' could just as easily be called, ''Evil Dead 2[nd version]'' or ''Evil Dead 2[nd interpretation]'' for clarity. ''Evil Dead II'' is a ''STAND ALONE'' FILM, apart from ''Evil Dead I'' ... ''Army of Darkness''-- the so-called 'third installment' of the ''Evil Dead Trilogy'' --is specifically a sequel to ''Evil Dead II,'' NOT a ''continuation'' of the entire ''Evil Dead'' storyline.Now whether ''ED2'' is the film Raimi and company ''would have'' made initially if their first ''Book of the Dead'' project (''Evil Dead's'' originally intended title) had access to the bigger budget the second film enjoyed is known only to Raimi and company: Judging from the similarities and differences, one can only guess. By direct comparison, ''ED2'' is much more of a lighthearted slapstick than its predecessor and the very graphic gore is more for storytelling and visual effect than for the shock value of the first film.In ''Evil Dead II,'' Bruce Campbell reprises his role as Ash; the role of his girlfriend Linda, originally portrayed by Betsy Baker, is now taken over by Denise Bixler. The supporting characters are comprised this time of a couple of country hicks and a couple of archaeologists, one of whom happens to be the adult daughter of the cabin's previous occupant -- the man who first unwittingly released the evil entities into the surrounding woods by means of an ancient incantation from the ''Book of the Dead'' (the same entities which have been unwittingly re-released by Ash when he replays the incantation that had been left recorded on tape by the previous occupant).As in the first film, the woods themselves come alive and prevent anyone from escaping their impending doom. But this group of unlikely heroes have an Ace in the hole: The daughter was paying a visit to the cabin in order to present her father with their latest and most significant find -- the 'lost pages' of the ''Book of the Dead,'' which include, among other things, an incantation to dispell the evil. So whereas ''Evil Dead I'' was a massacre  in a one-sided losing battle, ''Evil Dead II'' is full-scale war from start to finish.Bloody, hysterically funny at times, and packed with more memorable one-liners than a Steven Wright concert, ''Evil Dead II'' is definitely a welcome addition to any personal movie library ... don't let the hardcore ''Old School'' Evil Dead-ites dissuade you, or you'll miss out on a unique and enjoyable experience.* * *",N/A

The performances were excellent: Meryl Streep, Cher and Kurt Russel gave some of the best performances of their careers in my opinon.This movie is very scary. How can one put a price tag on a person's life for money or some kind of supremcy in the ""World's Nuclear Arsenal""? It is amazing to me how much the government and ""Local Yokals"" tried to cover up evidence and the death of Ms. Silkwood. There is so much our government is doing behind our backs in the name of""keeping its citizens safe"".One thing that really bothered me was Silkwood's co-workers. I am appalled and amazed at how complacant these people were with the flimsy protocals of a dangerous job. They  didnt want her to ""rock the boat""  and they wanted her to keep her mouth shut. These people didnt realize that their lives were more important than that job or any amount of money.I think everyone should see Silkwood, it will have you asking more questions than you can think of answers.",N/A

Schuyler Fisk is a welcome and refreshing addition to the cast as Hanks' charming girlfriend.  What can I say?  She's just really really...likeable.  She's very pretty, but not unbelievably so.  She's got that down-to-earth, girl-next-door quality that many boast but few possess.  In other words, we believe she's a real person.  And the ending is very good, very original.

Filmed in B&W and in faux-documentary style, the film follows Lenny Bruce from the start of his career and his doomed marriage with his wife. With an anonymous interviewer recording conversations with the people around him, including his mother, wife and manager, this 70s portrait of Lenny Bruce is an intimate look at the comic's career and life. It's incredible to see Hoffman's almost boyish charm and look at the beginning of the film to the rough, tired look towards the end.
