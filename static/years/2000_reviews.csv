524607,"Rules of Engagement is a gripping courtroom thriller that has a lot of plot holes just as soon as you start thinking about all the situations that occurred.  It has two things going for it:  terrific acting and fine direction from William Friedkin, and both elements are able to withstand the flaws.The film's best parts are in the first half hour, featuring two riveting action sequences, involving the jungle hell of Vietnam and the rescue of the ambassador in Yemen.  The rest of the film can't quite match this in intensity, but then again, that only goes to prove that Friedkin can stage an action sequence.The ending is when the film starts to lose steam.  No major revelation occurs, the entire trial moves in a straightforward, routine manner, and in the end, it feels anti-climactic, as if though nothing huge was accomplished.",N/A

561524,"Like most movie parodies, ""Scary Movie"" starts out well then begins to head downhill as it exhausts the possibilities of its limited material.  Certainly, few genres are as rife for self-satire as the teen slasher films that have proliferated in theatres ever since the early 1980's.  Seeing, however, as even some of the earliest ""Friday the 13th"" and ""Halloween"" films seem like ancient history to today's core movie going public, ""Scary Movie"" draws upon more contemporary examples of the genre like ""Scream"" and ""I Know What You Did Last Summer"" as its source of inspiration.  In its opening stretches, ""Scary Movie"" has a great deal of fun parodying the many ludicrous conventions that have long defined these films:  the use of 30-year old actors to portray empty-headed, nubile adolescents; the heavy emphasis on teen sexuality and partial nudity; the inane actions of the killer's victims who seem to do everything possible to hurl themselves into dangerous situations; and the oh-so-predictable false scare (usually caused by a leaping cat) followed immediately by the inevitable killer's attack.Directed by Keenan Ivory Wayans and boasting a screenplay concocted by no fewer than six (count `em SIX) writers, ""Scary Movie"" establishes a high speed rhythm and pace that the filmmakers manage to sustain through most of the film's 88-minute running time - though there is a noticeable tendency on the part of the film to lag in the last half hour.  Part of the problem could be that, as with most films made up essentially of sound and sight gags haphazardly strung together, it is inevitable that some of the bits will succeed better than others and that, as the movie rolls along, the inspiration will run a little dry and the humor will become less spontaneous and more forced.  Indeed, this type of movie genre parody has always worked best when applied in small doses on TV series like ""Saturday Night Live,"" ""In Living Color"" and even the ""Carol Burnett Show.""  Stretched out to full length, such concepts often suffer the curse of diminishing returns.Occasionally, the screenplay edges so close to the limits of good taste that one may question whether or not the material is truly appropriate for the age group at which the movie is obviously targeted.  The crudity is actually much more comically effective when it is merely hinted at than when it is so openly spelled out and displayed.  But then subtlety is not exactly a strong suit of the straight horror movie genre either.""Scary Movie"" is, at least, blessed with a winning, game cast made up of appropriately post adolescent actors who understand well the mannerisms and speech patterns of the stereotypes they embody.  The overall good-natured quality of the film and its fairly high laugh ratio of gems to clunkers make ""Scary Movie"" an imperfect but generally likeable popcorn entertainment.",Scary Movie

20879,"The movie begins very suspensefull rightaway. The openingsscene is very disturbing and the strongest scene of the movie.After that, the movie takes some time to show the characters lives and explain everything. If you  don't really pay attention this could be a bit boring but it is needed to  make this movie so good and suspensefull.  But this also makes this a movie  wich is very thrilling and good when you see it for the first time, but not  to watch it for a second time.But the best thing of the movie is, like a  lot people are saying, the ending. It is very disturbing but logic. I won't  say more about it than that it is the best ending I have seen in a movie  for quite a long time.The performances of Jeff Bridges and Tim Robbins  are very good but especialy Joan Cusack is very good though it is a bit  strange to see her in this kind of movie. But she is very believable as  Cheryl Lang.So if you like good and a bit scary thrillers, you  deffinitly have to see &quot;Arlington Road&quot;.  But don't buy it.",N/A
361912,"First and foremost, I really enjoyed this film, as evidenced by the 5 stars I gave it.  However, there are some problems I had with the film and  the DVD release of it.  First of all, The Crow follows James O'Barr's  original story quite closely, with the addition of some characters such as  Top Dollar's sister the Asian mystic, and Top Dollar's assassin/bodyguard.  I found that the Asian mystic took away from the film.  She was added in in  order to play the role that the skeleton portrayed in the book, but her  feeble lines and lack of acting ability took away from this film for me.  I  also hold this film responsible for the unfortunate current trend in  selling a movie based on the soundtrack.  The soundtrack to The Crow was  well thought out, and utilized much of the music that James O'Barr listened  to while writing The Crow.  Irritatingly enough, Trent Reznor is featured  as well, covering a Joy Division song - the soundtrack should have just  featured Joy Division - but Reznor was flavor-of-the-month when this film  was released in '94 and his popularity sells records.  I was disappointed  to see James O'Barr take his creation and sell it off - The Crow was never  meant to move beyond the initial story, but O'Barr got greedy and now  there's a plethora of comics featuring the Crow, and even a complete  cheese-ball of a sequel that made me sick to watch (see my review of The  Crow: City of Angels).  There's even talk of a third movie, to further  disgrace Brandon Lee's memory and the reason for the writing of The Crow to  begin with.  A TV series cropped up a few years back that the Sci-Fi  Channel is running in syndication - it generally follows the ideals of the  film and I have found some of the episodes enjoyable to watch.  The DVD was  put together nicely (one review said the picture quality was too dark, but  the DVD has the same level of brightness as on VHS as well as when the film  was first on the silver screen).  I was really hoping for some extras: the  theatrical trailer, the interview snippet that was included on the  widescreen VHS, and the unreleased footage of Eric and the skeleton.  A  secondary audio-only track would have been nice, especially with all the  thought that went into both the score by Graeme Revell and the soundtrack.  But the most important part is the film itself, and that is reason enough  to purchase the DVD.  The Crow is an incredible film, and a fitting final  piece for Brandon Lee's talent.",N/A
484048,"Nineteen ninety-nine was an outstanding year for adaptations of major literary works, but of all the great books that came to the screen last  year, this is my favorite.  John Irving's novel and adaptation is one of  the most complete stories I can remember in many years.  It is poignant,  exhilarating, and astutely human in its scope, presenting a myriad of human  emotions and experiences.Often, when a story attempts to cross genres so  broadly, it fails from lack of depth or insufficiency of the writer or  director to meet the variable demands of such a wide-ranging treatment.  This film was a comedy, a tragedy, a romance, a human-interest story, a  character study, and a period piece, and each element was excellently  done.This was all accomplished without sacrificing the philosophical and  emotional depth Irving imbues in all his works.  Irving weaves a strong  moral into this story; that rules need to be questioned and that being  human is not so easily codified.  He revisits this theme repeatedly, with  each character facing dilemmas regarding societal and personal rules that  are difficult to reconcile in the given situations.If there is one thing  that stands out about this story, it is its human realism.  These are  ordinary people struggling with problems we all face.  We come to have  affection for almost all of them, and can identify with their tribulations.  Although the story is excessively sentimental and fatalistic, it reminds  us that life is complicated and doesn't always turn out the way we plan or  hope.From a filmmaking perspective, we could not have asked more from  Lasse Hallstrom.  Known most in the U.S. for his direction of `What's  Eating Gilbert Grape', Hallstrom has been making wonderful films in Europe  for almost twenty years.  However, this film will certainly go down as his  finest work.  In the featurette on the DVD, he said that when he goes to  Blockbuster with his daughter and sees it on the shelf, he will have a  feeling of pride; and well he should.This motion picture was beautifully  filmed with rich cinematography, breathtaking locations, and precise period  props and costumes.  However, the greatest achievement for Hallstrom,  working in concert with Irving, was to orchestrate a large cast in such a  way that no character seemed insignificant.  Hallstrom took great care to  do enough development of each character (often just visually without any  dialogue) that he made us care for each of them.  He gave the film an  emotional depth and breadth that is difficult to achieve in two hours.  His  work with the children in the orphanage was superb, bringing forth their  innocence and enthusiasm without minimizing their plight.The acting was  uniformly outstanding.  Tobey Maguire infused Homer with the right  combination of idealism, naivet&eacute; and inner strength to make him an  unassuming but powerful lead.  Charlize Theron continues to impress me with  her acting ability.  Besides her enchanting girl-next-door attractiveness,  she showed terrific range in a character that at first seemed shallow, but  later proved to be quite complex.Michael Caine has had a legendary  career spanning close to half a century.  He has long been one of my  favorite actors.  His performance here was powerful and well deserving of  the acclaim he received.  Dr. Larch was an extremely complex character;  egotistical, self-abusive, manipulative and recalcitrant, yet a saintly,  self-sacrificing and loving crusader for the good of the children.  Caine's  ability to span that range was remarkable.Finally, I have the highest  praise for Delroy Lindo as Mr. Rose, the orchard foreman.  Lindo's bright  smile and enthusiasm created a rock solid character with charm, strength  and simple wisdom.  He captures our admiration immediately, and despite his  despicable act, we cannot help but pity him in the end.After having seen  all the films that were nominated by the Academy for best picture last  year, I have to say that this was my personal favorite.  It wasn't as  flashy as the rest; in fact, this was downright old fashioned in its  approach.  They just don't write stories like this anymore, and that's a  shame.  I rated it a 10/10.  In its quiet way, it captured my heart.",The Cider House Rules VHS

555538,"This dull biopic treats the life of Michel de Nostradamus so superficially that each event is only dressing for the visions that are his claim to fame. Unfortunately, director Roger Christian presents these in such a pop way that by the time Michel is painting a swastika on the wall, the audience is laughing. Perhaps there is no way to present the prophecies visually without failing. It's hard not to view Nostradamus as a know-it-all since we have the benefit of hindsight, but that doesn't explain his efforts to alter what he sees in the world, which you would think is pointless. The cast is a mire of accents, although some of the actors do make an impression. This is possibly the best film opportunity Amanda Plummer had up to the 1995 release year of the film, since Daniel in 1983, and as Catherine de Medici she does well. Maja Morgenstein brings a Maria Callas mystery and passion to her role as Helene, and F Murray Abraham seems to have fun as Scalinger. Tcheky Karyo, who resembles the young George Segal, plays Nostro as a passive Christ, when what is needed is the demonism Rutger Hauer brings to his cameo.",N/A
159827,"I loved this movie.  After renting a string of movies while recovering from surgery I liked this one so much I went out and bought it.  Jennifer  Anniston is very good in the comedic role, the same sort of roll as on  Friends, but she is much less of an airhead character in this movie.  But,  my favorite in the movie is Jay Mohr.  He spends much of the movie with  &quot;Puppy Dog Eyes&quot; for Jennifer but holds his ground.  Excellent  change from his role in Jerry McGuire.Basic story is Girl (Kate) wants  Boy (Sam) and job recognition, girl isn't getting either.  Girl's friend  leads people to believe that she is engaged to another boy (Jay playing  Nick) who she has only met once at a wedding.  Nick gets famous and Kate's  life gets complicated.  She tries to get Nick to come play the part (for  money, which he refuses) and he agrees to &quot;come to dinner&quot;.  Meanwhile Nick is falling hard for Kate but she doesn't want it.  Or does  she?  As with many real life situations she doesn't realize what she is  missing until it is to late (or is it?).  Also thrown in is some really  interesting information about teh dog-eat-dog world of promotions general  and specifically the advertising business.If you want a light hearted  &quot;chick flick&quot; (as my husband would call it) get some popcorn and  definately rent this one!One side interesting fact.

156054,"The 1st being &quot;An American Werewolf in London&quot; this movie is  good,but their is a reason &quot;American&quot; won the Oscar for best  effects.  That reason:they are better than the effects in this film. I was  impressed by this movie though,to be honest,when I first saw it in 1980 it  scared me half to death. It is a very effective horror movie and well worth  the time to check out. As a matter of fact,this and &quot;American  Werewolf&quot; are the best werewolf movies ever.

195346,"Tokuma Sentai Shinesman also known as Special Duty Combat Unit Shinesman is a Power Ranger pardoy and so much more.  The story begins with a cute guy named Matsumotto Hiroya who in part of the first episode tells the  audience about how he became Shinesman Red.

Based on his answer to one of the questions at the interview he becomes  enlisted as a member of the Shinesman team.The really funny stuff about  this anime besides the lousy colors, sorry weapons (like the business card  cutter, and tie clip bombs) is the dialogue and the way the humor is set  up.  Some anime tends to have humor that doesn't make the culture  transition from Japanese type humor to humor that a Western could  accept,  understand, like, or appreciate but this one does so perfectly.

554580,"This DVD is definately worth purchasing but not for the movie (explained at the end).Heavy Metal 2000 is a linear plot about a woman seeking revenge on a lunatic, posessed by an alien power, who destroyed her home planet.Standard science fiction plot with no twists.The single story line is a departure from the vingette style of the original heavy metal movie.  This has the advantage of allowing a more coherent plot but has the disadvantage of not letting the artists explore as many different scenes and visual styles as they did in the original.  I think that the illustration style of the sequel is better but not as original as the first movie.  My personal pet peeve is the introduction of a poorly done CGI (computer generated image) at the end.  Gimmicky and not effective.The sound effects are well done if you have a digital surround sound arrangement.  However, the highlight of the movie is the great hard core soundtrack.  Changing the DVD to the isolated sound track and just playing it for the music is well worth it.But the best reason to buy the DVD is the featurette on Julie Strain.

465247,"The Thin Red Line has been a hotbed of debate between its supporters and detractors ever since its 1998 release.  Many people consider it among the greatest films to which they have beared witness. Others loathe it as three  hours of their wasted. If great art can be defined as something which  evokes powerful emotions, then The Thin Red Line certainly will meet that  criteria.  Just take a look as the impassioned arguments for or against the  film in any of these reviews.  I think the reason the film has such a mixed  response is that it reached a far greater audience that it probably was  catering to. The director, Terrence Malick, made two critically-acclaimed  masterpieces in the 70s that, while certainly influencial, never reached a  wide audience outside film-buffs.  With the The Thin Red Line Fox pictures  made shrewd (financial) decisions in marketing it as a competitor to Saving  Private Ryan as the year's best war flick.  Certainly this caused the film  to make significantly more money and also have the opportunity to be seen  by some who otherwise would have probably missed it if it only played in  art-house cinemas. On the other hand, The Thin Red Line was subjected to  the invetible comparisons to Saving Private Ryan despite the two being  worlds apart.  Because of this the standard American-movie going public was  treated to a nearly post-modern film lasting three hours with endlessly  complex messsages and themes.With the requisite background aside, The  Thin Red Line to be a masterpiece. Martin Scorcese may have put it best  when he described The Thin Red Line (he ranked it the 2nd best film of the  90s) as a film where one doesn't have to watch from the beginning to end.  While there is certailny a linear chain of events in the film. There is no  specific delineation of time and the flow of action is vastly different  from typical Hollywood fare.The story ostensibly follows a company of  recruits and their endeavors to take Guadalcanal. Malick uses about six  different narrators and doesn't feel the need to differentiate between  them. Some people decry this as confusing. However, Malick's use this  technique relates to his theme of oneness.  Certainly on the first viewing  one will probably not be able to follow all of the plot, but that makes the  film watchable and intriguing repeatedly as the beauty and complexity of  the individual stories become more clear.Even without interesting  characters The Thin Red Line would be remarkable for its gorgeous,  gorgeous, cinematography.  Though the DVD will never be able to recreate  the awesome experience of screening the film in a theater the transfer is  excellent with rich and full colors.  Possibly even worth buying a 75&quot;  HDTV just to see the film in all of its glory.In summation, The Thin  Red Line is a film to watch again and again.  I think the more times one  sees the more complex and ineffable the film becomes.

524884,"KEEPING THE FAITH is a fine example of how extra features on a DVD can help change your mind about a film.  When I first saw it, my immediate reaction was total disappointment.  It's not that I thought the film bad, exactly.  It was just that the previews had made it out to be a hilarious romantic comedy, and it wasn't exactly splittin' my sides.When you look at the deleted scenes and hear the audio commentary, it becomes clear that producer/director Ed Norton wasn't trying to make the film the studio was selling.  It's not that he comes out and says, ""Disney's marketing department screwed me."" But you see through his dialogue with his writer that he made conscious choices away from extremely funny material.  He wasn't trying to make a hilarious movie, just a good story about three friends.This is particularly evident when viewing the deleted scenes.  Though completely shot and scored, Norton decides to axe what is clearly the funniest orgasm scene since Meg Ryan faked it in a restaurant.  You also see how much of Ben Stiller's naturally funnier self was edited out.  Why?  Norton says, to the audible chagrin of his writer, that it didn't really fit in the movie he was trying to make.Whether you agree with him on this and other choices, the fact is that if the movie he was trying to make had been marketed, it would've garnered more appreciation.Still, Norton didn't quite succeed at making a solid romance, either.  It's not the kind of movie you'll watch over and over again.  After the engaging set up, there aren't really any plot twists, much less unexpected outcomes.  It's just another romance set in New York.  Lacking either remarkable comedy or profound insight, the film easily releases you from its grasp once you see it.  Norton has traded the innovative promise of the plot for mere likability.  I think, perhaps, that Norton was trying so hard not to cause religious offense that he winds up seeming almost gun shy of his own subject matter.  Or maybe the sudden rewrite of a huge chunk of the movie days prior to filming is what tripped things up.What I really think sinks the film, though, is Norton's own character.  He's just not a plausible romantic presence.  At no point do you ever feel like Brian might actually GET Anna, so his entire presence is superflous to the romantic plot.  Worse, the storyline depends on him going beyond being hurt by Anna's inevitable rejection, into the area of absolutely unprofessional conduct.  It just doesn't make any sense what he does in the end, and yet without his action, the story can't advance.All this aside, students of film will want to look at the DVD version of this movie, just because it's a great case study of the indirect tension between studio and filmmaker, and, to a lesser extent, between director and writer.

There is no need to adjust anything on your television to view  this DVD/video, as you will only be wasting your time, after, of course,  your money.I'd also like to take an opportunity to thank Rhino for  another wasted 3-D video release, &quot;ROBOT MONSTER&quot;.

About every five years an Oscar goes to someone involved in his latest film, and this is one so honored.

305540,"I know this review will earn me boos, hisses, and &quot;not helpful&quot; votes, but my wife and I (both lovers of old movies) watched this a few nights back and frankly, we were baffled.  Howard Hawks has made his share  of movies with &quot;men's men&quot;, but these characters are the most  opaque and wooden I've ever seen!  They are air-freight pilots delivering  to the treacherous Andes mountain area, led by the normally charming (or at  least interesting) Cary Grant.  When the first pilot takes to air in the  film (Noah Beery, I believe), you can hear in the inflection of his voice  over the intercom that he seems resigned to his fate--the fog's closing in,  and he's doomed to crash.  Indeed he does, as do a number of the other  pilots that follow in the film.  The job doesn't seem to have any merits  above its risks, and Jules Furthman's turgid script doesn't give us any  hint as to why these men would risk their lives doing this job.  It's  implicit that flying IS their life, and there's this hunger that is  satisfied only through this activity.  But it's a tenet of the movie and a  credo of the men that nothing needs to be explained, it's a man thing, and  one just needs to move on.  So what we get for &quot;entertainment&quot;  almost borders on parody, as mission after mission goes awry, and the  tight-lipped toughies muddle through.  For romantic interest, there's Jean  Arthur as an itinerant showgirl who almost immediately falls in love with  Grant, though he &quot;wouldn't force a girl to do anything she didn't want  to&quot; and no woman has been able to cope with the stress of living that  close to death (though, in the film, Grant never actually gets up in a  plane); there's also Rita Hayworth, one of his exes, who's now with  McPherson (Richard Barthelmess), a pilot who bailed and let his partner die  in a previous air accident.  He of course, gets to redeem himself, and at  the end gets to nurse a beer with the guys, cradling it in his burnt and  bandaged hands.  Hayworth also tries to seduce Grant, to no avail.  Eventually the girls fall into line (acting appropriately stoic), and  Arthur decides to hang around after Grant, in his typical off-handed way  lets her know he loves her (via a two-headed coin)--but he loves flying  more.  I couldn't fathom this movie or this closed society; the story is  slow and repetitive and the actors have been directed to suppress every bit  of charm or life they have within them (you can see it trying to escape  from Jean Arthur)--it's all very morose, banal and a trial to sit through.  As a rule, I don't give one-star reviews--but I can honestly say I hated  this movie.",Only Angels Have Wings VHS
204232,"Clift and especially de Havilland's performances in this film have been much touted, and they have strong merits. However, the performances to watch this movie for are really those of Ralph Richardson and Miriam Hopkins. Wyler's direction is tightly controlled and de Havilland sometimes appears over-directed.Clift, on the other hand, seems under-directed, free, and is constantly startling. A bit out of place, at times a little off the mark, but very, very surprising...and very, very original. It is worth watching his early films (like Red River, The Heiress, I Confess and Indiscretion of an American Wife) to fully absorb the novelty of what he brought to the screen. His instincts, though not always dramatically of a piece, are nevertheless so unexpected that they may make him a real joy to watch on screen.The Copland score adds much to the film, and the scene in which Clift plays 'Plaisir d'Amour' to de Havilland and then walks over to her while she draws back (cowers?) on her sofa is very, very special. It fully represents the artistry of the cast and crew involved in making this film.The ending is remarkable. The story and characters are justly famous for their representation of the shyness of the character and her relationship with her family. It is to the credit of this film, that inspite of all it has in place to distract from the story and characters, they are what remain in the mind long after you are done watching the film.

English is not his  first language and he looks lost, the director needed to work harder to get  more emotion from him.  Or perhaps that is how they decided to play his  character, strong, silent and unimaginatively like in alot of other action  films.

384085,"&quot;Thunderball&quot; is the fourth entry of the James Bond series and in terms of box office was the most successful Bond film of the 1960's. Coming fresh off the heels the very successful &quot;Goldfinger&quot;,  producers Cubby Broccoli and Harry Saltzman, armed with their largest  budget to date, set out to produce a blockbuster film, filmed for the first  time in a widescreen format. The advertising blitz for Thunderball helped  produce an air of great anticipation among the moviegoing public.  Thunderball did not disappoint them.Ironically, Thunderball was  originally intended to be the story of the first James Bond film but  problems negotiating with Keven McCrory, who owned the film rights to  Thunderball, force the producers to use &quot;Dr. No&quot; instead. It is  perhaps it was all for the best that things turned out the way they did.  With Sean Connery back again as James Bond and Terence Young returning the  director's chair after skipping &quot;Goldfinger&quot; as well as writer  Richard Maibalm, Thunderball was able to capture James Bond at his peak.  The cast of supporting character also returned with Bernard Lee as  &quot;M&quot;, Lois Maxwell as Miss MoneyPenny, and Desmond Llewelyn as  &quot;Q&quot;. The character of CIA agent Felix Leiter also returned though  played by yet a different actor, Rik Van Nutter.In Thunderball, that  evil organization SPECTRE is back and this time, it is playing for the  highest stakes. Its number two agent, Emilio Largo (played by Aldolfo Celi)  plans to steal two atomic bombs from NATO and hold Britain hostage for 100  million pounds sterling. Aided by the beautiful but lethal Fiona Volpe  (played by Luciana Paluzzi), Largo succeeds in obtaining the bombs. James  Bond, following a hunch, succeeds in meeting Largo in the Bahamas through  his mistress, the lovely Domino (played by Claudine Auger). Can Bond locate  the bombs before time runs out?The large budget for Thunderball allowed  the production team to stage and film James Bond's latest adventure in the  most lavish manner. The use of widescreen cameras made many of the scenes  filmed at Pinewood Studios, M's conference room for example, appear larger  than life. Thunderball also pioneered a number of underwater photography  techniques, which paid off when filming the underwater battle royale. In  fact, Thunderball is best seen in its widescreen format as the standard TV  format shows less than half the frame.But just as important as the  production values were the performances and the chemistry of the cast.  Aldolfo Celi's portrayal of Largo is superb and the banter between Connery  and Luciana Paluzzi is both suspenseful and amusing. There is plenty of  action, too starting with the fight in the opening sequence, to the  underwater battle, and the hydrofoil racing out of control.Thunderball  is considered by many Bond fans, including this one, as Sean Connery's tour  de force as the sauve secret agent. Though Connery starred in two more Bond  films for Broccoli and Saltzman, these films never seem to click with  audiences as well as this one did when it was released in 1965. If one had  to choose only one Bond film of the 1960's keep in one's film collection,  Thunderball would be an excellent choice.",Thunderball VHS

At the same time look past the action  and you will see and feel the love and the loss in this.

305920,"This tape comprises the first two episodes of the brilliant British series. Loosely based as science fiction due to its setting in the future, this is primarily a drama series based in fact, dealing with human rights  abuses that unhappily occur in our present. In an unspecified time  (although not too far in the future), Earth is run by a totalitarian  Federation - dissidents are murdered or sent to penal colonies and the  populace is drugged into a state of subservient apathy. Into this scenario  enters Roj Blake, a seemingly unassuming man. Blake is asked by a friend to  join a meeting of rebels; this he does, with fateful consequences. The  first episode, &quot;The Way Back&quot; is the best to authentically  capture the Orwellian atmosphere the series is based on. The sterile, white  corridors of the domed city; the ruthless and murderous black suited  security patrols; the psycho-manipulators - they all depict perfectly this  depressing possibility of the future. Blake's nightmarish journey as he  rediscovers his repressed past is harrowing - his mental breakdown,  complete with horrific and violent flashbacks, is a disturbing indicator of  what this regime is capable of. The second episode, &quot;Space Fall&quot;,  deals with the formation of the group that will become Blake's crew. Of  particular interest is the introduction of Kerr Avon, the cynical would-be  computer fraudster, who will become the series' most interesting character.  One of the down sides to &quot;Blake's 7&quot; is that the introduction is  very slow - it continues over the next two episodes. A casual viewer may be  put off by this, despite the importance of understanding the background and  motivation of the characters in the later stories. In short, essential for  the sake of continuity, but very heavygoing. But perserverance will reward  the new viewer.","Blake's 7, Vol. 01 - The Way Back / Space Fall VHS"

What a delight to experience the magic of this performance on DVD! While opera, in general, is not noted for high quality acting, the performances of Judith Blegen (Gretel) and Frderica von Stade ( Hansel), who never seems to be other than visually and sonically lovely, are simply captivating! Blegen's soprano is lyric, light and smooth, and is perfectly matched by von Sade's mezzo.

It was always on in my house think of it  as a communal fireplace. I had no real direction in life other than I felt  the need to be entertained. Fight club also takles the fact that men have  been feminized over the years. Men in are current climate are seen mostly  as sperm donors rather than people. Their masculine agressive instincts are  seen as a negative. So take an T.V overdosed male, place him in an eight by  eight cubicle after college in a stressful job. How does that person cope.  Fight club faces these issues by showing extremes. It offers no outcomes  only the problems. Which I feel is a flaw of the film. To those who dislike  the movie I say this. Should we really turn a blind eye to the ugliness  that sometimes surfaces in life? I feel we should think about them to try  to solutions on an individual level. Which is what I feel this movie was  about. Raising an issue to provoke thought. Also Fight Club does not  promote anarchy.",N/A
157705,"Pedro Almodovar's &quot;Live Flesh&quot; is a film noir full of style,  exhilaration, richness and excellent erotic storytelling. Almodovar, the  best director from Spain since the great Luis Bunuel, shows here a  complexity in filmmaking few directors achieve. His screenplay here is  exquisitly detailed in story and situations. The story by itself keeps us  gripped and interested. The way the story unfolds has a lot of energy and  Almodovar surprises us with revelations at every corner.

Following her Oscar-winning turn in Mike Nichols' ground-breaking drama  &quot;Who's Afraid Of Virginia Woolf?&quot;, this is the gifted Sandy  Dennis' finest hour on screen. As the demented heroine, Dennis makes you  feel your way into her character's dark and ultimately disturbing world.  It's a blissful, strikingly effective performance, and watching it one  might wonder why Dennis didn't win a second Oscar.

475950,"Like the bulk of those out there I patiently awaited the next installment to the Star Wars Universe ever since I first learned that there were going to possibly be additional films to the original Episodes 4, 5 &amp; 6 (I think I learned about this sometime between the release of 'Empire' and 'Jedi').  I wasn't a fanatic who waited in line for days or even weeks like some, but I WAS fortunate enough to see it the day before release and as I sat through it, I couldn't help but wonder: 'What is WRONG with the critics?!  I LOVE this movie!'  I really DID.  I think the MAJOR problem that most people had with Episode I was after having waited for so long, many had come up with their OWN ideas of HOW the movie should go, so much so that by the time the movie came out there was NOTHING that could have possibly made them satisfied.With that said, I DID however find one very MAJOR and GLARING error with Episode I:  From the earlier movies we discover that Obi Wan was trained as a Jedi BY YODA but for some odd reason George Lucas has decided to alter this established course by having Obi Wan trained by Qui Gon Jin.  Now while I enjoyed the character played by Liam Neeson (one of my favorite parts of the entire movie, in fact) I found that deep down I just could not find it in my heart to forgive Lucas for taking such a HUGE departure from his OWN story!  Now that being a small (but significant) complaint, I still found the movie visually stunning (how could it NOT be?) but I also feel deep down that the starships of the original trilogy were way more cool than the ones featured in Episode I (did anyone else notice that Princess Amidala's ship looked suspiciously like a silver suped-up version of the SR-71 spy plane?).  I am finding myself anxiously waiting for Episode II (due the latter part of May 2002) and I don't CARE what Lucas has in store for us, I am just excited to SEE it.",N/A
481114,"As with almost every archival Beatles-related release, this is another product that tries to straddle the line of being for the collector and the casual fan both (leaving neither really happy with the end result). Once again they have erred on the favor of the casual fan, who will not be the  one buying the majority of this release. Capitol/EMI never seem to learn  from the great bootlegs how to compile really good releases.If you have  Imagine (the videos film), and Imagine (the documentary film), and Yoko Ono  Then and Now, and the John Lennon videos collection, then you already have  more of THIS video than you SHOULD have. The NEW stuff in this video is  GREAT! Where is the rest of it? I could have gone for way more recording  scenes, this hardly shows George playing, no King Curtis, no Badfinger.  Just enough to tease us, then back to more recycled footage. Obviously  these people filmed everything they did almost all the time, so why do we  have to keep seeing the same scenes over and over again in each (NEW?)  product. I am all for putting things in context, but the old stuff makes  the basis for this dvd, not the new stuff. Just enough is left out of each  product that you have to buy all of them, but once you have them it's  pretty redundant. Of course the casual fan is not going to care because  they will only see one of the versions, but for the rest of us this is  getting really old. They also took the cheap way out and left in all the  dust, hairs, scratches, and streaks in the video too, rather than cleaning  it up like Yellow Sub. And, unlike Yellow Sub, the 5.1 soundtrack is not  that big of a deal musically, and not that sonically different from the cd  remaster.The extra interview is nice, since they went out of their way  to make that complete. I just wish as much thought would have gone into the  main feature. Do you need this? Yes. If it's the only Lennon video you  have, you'll probably be pretty happy, and it's much better than the videos  version Imagine. If you have all the others, you still need this because  there is just enough new to re-sell you the old again.","Gimme Some Truth - The Making of John Lennon's ""Imagine"""
165953,"Okay, so I'm neither a man nor a weather-forecaster.  Still, the first time I saw this movie back in the 80's, I knew it was about my life.  Back in those days, I couldn't understand why nothing was going the way I  thought it should, no matter how hard I tried to bend and twist my will and  that of others to fit my plan. Ah, the ego - it is a marvelous  misconception.Our hero, Phil Connor (Bill Murray), has enough ego to  choke - well, certainly to choke any interest the lovely Andie MacDowell  might have in him when they end up trapped in a small town in the middle of  a blizzard, on GroundHog Day.For her, it's a one day event. Heck, for  everyone but Phil, it's a one day event.  But Phil - well, Phil wakes up  again and again to the sound of &quot;I've Got You Babe&quot; - same day,  same people and the only way things change is when Phil's behavior changes.Unfortunately for Phil, but fortunately for those of us watching this  movie, it takes him several wake-up calls before he gets it.  I've tried  figuring out how many years these repeated days add up to - but I can't and  it doesn't really matter.Some of us learn slowly, and when we are in  the midst of 'getting it', this movie is a comfort.  We're not the only  ones! There's hope!An under-appreciated movie, and Bill Murray is the  perfect star.  He manages to be obnoxious and unlikeable in the beginning,  and even if you don't like his style much (I really am not a Bill Murray  fan), you end up liking the guy in the end.

20031,"Despite having a fantastic cast and spot-on wardrobe, set decoration and cinematography, THE END OF THE AFFAIR flounders because it tries so hard to be a morality play, it forgets to give us interesting characters.  Each of  the three leads is locked by their respective world views into senses of  propriety that largely prevent them from communicating.  They all believe  they are acting in the right way, according to their own system of beliefs,  and so feel no need to explain their actions.  Consequently, very little  actually *happens* in the film.  It is a film ultimately about reactions.  And that's fine stuff for a novel, like the Graham Greene basis for the  screenplay, but it hardly makes for a satisfying night at the movies.It's made particularly unsatisfying because we're never really  introduced to the characters.  We don't know why Julianne Moore's character  married Stephen Rae's.  And we need to know. There's certainly nothing in  the present of their relationship which explains why they would have  married.  They seem to have nothing in common, and Stephen Rea acts so  completely joyless throughout, it's hard to see why they'd even be good  friends.  We likewise don't see the root of Ralph Fiennes' atheism, nor  indeed Julianne Moore's Christianity.To be sure, this is somewhat  faithful to the novel, which has all events transpiring before the eyes of  Fiennes' character, who doubles as the story's narrator.  Given that, it  makes sense that there would be a certain incompleteness of vision about  the other characters.  But the dearth of exposition in this film is far  more than can be explained by narrative perspective.  It's simply missing,  and there's no good  reason for that.Without that vital character  background, we don't care about them--and we're certainly unimpressed by  the moral their story aims to teach.  In fact, the groundwork laid for that  conclusion is so sparse, and the conclusion itself so controversial, that  we're left feeling as if the filmmakers have committed a form of gratuitous  blasphemy.(DVD NOTES: This product has an above average collection of  extras, including two audio commentaries, a making-of featurette and an  isolated music score.  The featurette is rather forgettable, but the audio  commentaries are significant and interesting-more engrossing than the film  itself.IMPORTANT NOTE:  There's a double-feature version of this product  that has both the original film and this remake on it.  It's more  expensive, but worth it.)",N/A

484613,"This is one of those movies that I found prfoundly disappointing because it had the potential to be one of the greatest of the American Sci-Fi films and it blew it.The movie is great in that there is an attempt to respect  the laws of physics and mechanics. So, an astronaut is lost because he  approaches a derilict spacecraft at too high a velocity to hold on.  The  others can't rescue him due to lack of fuel, and the lengthy startup  procedure for the spaceship.  I couldn't help thinking that in another  movie there would have been 15 minutes of death-defying stunts and whizzing  spaceships to rescue the astronaut.  I also thought that the ship used to  fly to Mars was very realistically designed.The problem with the movie  is the requirement to basically watch a 15 minute home-movie before the  action begins, more home-movies in the spacecraft headed to Mars, and  finally an extra-terresrial at the end that looks like it belongs in a B  grade Sci-Fi flick of the 50's.

511883,"Actually, the many loves, and types of love, contained in this little film are quite 'ordinary' and happen every day. They just don't usually make it to the big, or little, screen. We have a guy who owns a house. He can't  come out because his mother fantasizes that he will get married one day. He  rents rooms to a female in a rock band (with whom he, and just about  everyone else, has an affair; a dead guy; a narcissistic (and justifiably  so) actor who likes it both ways; a cute little Asian boy; and an  over-weight bank teller. The movie must be viewed as a self-contained soap  opera, considering the myriad twists of plot and sub-plot, which involves  the usual betrayal, bank robbery, adultery, and murder. The nicest facet of  the story is the developing romance between Vince (the Asian boy) and his  'straight' hispanic neighbor, Ramon -- who is also the son of an abusive  father (upon whom his mother is cheating with Andy, the narcissistic  actor!). The only two who have any integrity in the film are Ramon and  Vince, and they are amply rewarded at the end. Probably only deserves three  stars, but the people are cute enough to bump it up to four. And it's just  nice to see a film where there is a natural variety of sexual preference.

482310,"The most terrifying scream is always the last one, or so ""Scream 3""proclaims. Surprisingly enough though, the ending to Kevin Williamson's clever trilogy doesn't let viewers down-- even without Williamson scripting  the final chapter.  From the opening scene fans of ""Scream"" and ""Scream  2"" will be shocked and pleasantly surprised at who lives and who dies. And  although the ending is your typical cheesy horror film conclusion, it fits  ""Scream"" perfectly. After all, this wasn't just any old horror franchise.  This horror series cleverly made fun of its own genre and trilogies while  scripting together an engaging and intriguing plotline that kept viewers  guessing to, appropriately enough, the very last scream. Written by Ehren  Kruger, ""Scream 3"" is the perfect ending to the horror franchise that  brought back scary movies in the `90s. Clever, funny and suspenseful,  ""Scream 3"" leaves the rules that ex-Scream star Jamie Kennedy clued viewers  in on in the original ""Scream"" at the door.  Neve Campbell, David  Arquette, and Courtney Cox-Arquette return for the final chapter of the  ""Scream"" series, but this film is Arquette and Cox-Arquette's alone. While  viewers should care about Campbell's character and whether or not she  lives, viewers will be cheering for the ruthless TV reporter Gail Weathers  and the dopey Deputy Dewey the whole time. Hopeless romantics will also get  caught up in whether or not the two on-again off-again, real-life duo will  end up happily ever after like they did in real life.  As though the  film wasn't great enough in the theater, the DVD just adds to the whole  ""Scream"" experience, giving away not only the alternate trilogy ending, but  also giving fans a chance to see deleted scenes and out-takes from all  three ""Scream"" films.

The concert scene at Albert Hall in London was very reminiscent of Hitchcock's ""The Man Who Knew Too Much.""

524140,"Yes, this is your basic, high concept, &quot;Aliens&quot;-on-a-planet-in-total-darkness, survival of the cutest, sci-fi terror film. With that as a template, the real question is: does it deliver the goods? I say yes.The plot is simple: A space ship crashes on a desert planet and the only survivors are an eclectic mix of characters who must somehow survive the perils of this planet to get to a ship that can get them off the planet. The trick is that this planet is about to go into a long total eclipse and there are these carnivorous beasts who only come out in &quot;pitch black&quot; that will eat everybody if they don't find away to work together and survive. The characters include a rookie pilot, a cop with a problem, some Islamic pilgrims, a couple of kids, an effete English rich guy, an Australian tracker, and a psycho killer.What happens and whether anyone lives or dies is pretty obvious to anyone who has seen at least one of these types of movies before, up until the very end. There are a few twists, a red herring or two, a couple of mysteries to be solved, and some secrets are revealed as the film progresses, but they all make sense for the drama of the story. At the last moment, however, I was actually not sure which way the movie was going to go. The filmmaker has the opportunity to make a statement about humanity (something about duty, redemption, and forgiveness), and the way the story ends makes that statement.The special effects are good and convincing. The production design effectively communicates the appropriate moods, from heat and desolation to darkness and claustrophobia. There is even an effect on the film that gives certain scenes a real &quot;other-worldly&quot; feel.At the end of it all, I felt like I had a quality cinematic experience, but something was lacking. The film seemed a little short, and the darkness of it was maybe a little one-dimentional. There was enough variety, enough thrills and chills, enough drama for this particular movie, but I did want something more to go with it. Something lighter, more humorous, maybe, but still in the sci-fi genre. Then I went and saw &quot;Galaxy Quest&quot; (which I have already reviewed). Yes! That's it! &quot;Pitch Black&quot; and Galaxy Quest,&quot; in that order, with a cartoon, serial, and newsreel, and we've got a perfect science fiction double feature! Break out the popcorn!",N/A

132418,"A lot of people had trouble finding the core of this movie, thus blaming  it for being too unfocused.  The main character in this movie is New York  City of the Nineties.  More specifically, it's an anti-Giuliani picture.  In this movie, Scorcese argues convincingly that the notorious qualities of  the &quot;old New York' still very much exist today.  The Giuliani  administration and large corporation(read Disney and Gap) has put  considerable effort in sweeping the underbelly of New York under a rug.  After seeing the movie, I could not look at my favorite city the same way.  I saw what the city's been trying to hide for the past few years more  clearly, even in the &quot;New Times Square&quot;.  If that doesn't  convince you, look at the statistics, the gap between the rich and the poor  grew dramatically, the percentage living below the poverty line rose, and  the number of homeless pretty much stayed the same.  Everything in this  movie conveys this message.Cage here embodies the psyche of someone  who is obviously frustrated and worn down by this disparity between the  real New York and the spin-driven hyped-up image of the new NYC.  Like in  Birdy and Leaving Las Vegas, Cage shows that his versatility is only  surpassed by the likes of Brando, Duval, De Niro, etc.  The rest of the  cast is stupendous.  The transfer is absolutely stunning, doing complete  justice to the gorgeous work that we've come to expect from Scorcese and  Richardson.",N/A

Instead  of the Hollywood happy ending, we have a dark and grim tale of family  morals and the loyalty between being a stand up guy and a family man.

The cast is excellent with Colm Meaney as  a remorseless crime boss, Ian Hart as Bobby's energetic friend, Famke  Janssen as Bobby's girlfriend, and the rest of the cast are in top form.

Unlike Jaws and Jaws 2 this movie has the dead people on the screen for a  fairly long period of time. After I saw it I was really embarrassed for the  director, Joe Alves. The acting was alright, it was just the photography,  the plot and the lack of the Jaws theme song (it was only used once) that  made the movie so bad.

Simon Templar, &quot;The Saint,&quot; was one of the latter. There never was much to Templar to begin with; he was just a debonair smart aleck in the tradition of Philo Vance and Bulldog Drummond. But surely even a fourth-rate cardboard character deserves more than this: being turned into a vehicle for Val Kilmer's apparently limitless self-indulgence. The film is actually a Kilmer anthology - donning about a dozen so-called disguises, he never gets around to acting the part of Templar, but he does run through all the trademark Val characters (smoldering lounge lizard, buck-toothed comic, stoic tough guy). We're supposed to care because he doesn't know how to be HIMSELF, but in fact we're grateful for small favors. The movie is also memorable for a second awful performance -- by Elisabeth Shue, who appears visibly frustrated and puzzled over how to play scenes with her bizarre co-star.",The Saint VHS

First, the story is serious and dark, but filled with  built-in action set pieces that mostly  (except for the parachute snowmobiles) fit right in and don't seem too  contrived. I was especially imressed that the finale wasn't a routine  shootout in the villian's secret fortress.  Second, the villians are  tragic and developed rather than the usual egomaniacal billionaire. They  are carefully written and add much to the depth of the film.  Third, there  are several supporting roles that are well-played and written, especially  Dame Judy Dench as M. The plucky Christmas Jones character is fun, and adds  a nice contrast to the silky Electra King.  Do I need to mention that  Pierce Brosnan is an excellent Bond? He really embodies Bond's  essence-sauve, sexy, and very dangerous.  Finally, the film is  beautifully shot and directed. Too many of the 70's and 80's Bonds looked  they were directed by committee.

This  parody of a 70's/80's rock band feels so absurd and realistic that members  of Aerosmith credit it with causing their epiphany that forced them to get  clean -- when the saw it they realized, even if it wasn't a direct parody  of them, it was close enough.Also, when they stopped selling the  original release of the DVD and VHS, it became the most 'stolen' rental  movie -- people would just take it out and eat the 'lost' fee.",This Is Spinal Tap

48696,"VERTIGO is one of my personal favorite film of all time, and if I write to praise this emotinally- filled obsessive love story, I just won't be able to stop. But following the lesson from the great Hitchcock himself, less is more.What I'd rather like to critisise is the &quot;restoration&quot; that was the basis of this DVD. Now it's true that VERTIGO has never looked as beautiful as this for the last doezen years or so before Harris and Katz restored and re-release it. The re-release print of the mid eighties was so poor in quality. So in that sense, you should buy this DVD because it is the best version available so far--for most of the audience.But this so-called &quot;restoration&quot; is controversial, and has a lot of problems. I must say that the best available version of the film is still the TECHNICOLOR-IB prints from the 50's and 60's, because IB prints don't fade in colors and there are still some prints available.Harris and Katz did the best they could to capture the colors, the visual beauty of the film, using the original negative, and their version basically looks fine, except for the very dark scene (such as the tower of San Juan Batista at the end). Now, as they and the film's associate producer Herbie Coleman points out on the commentary track, they restored the correct darkness, but not the contrast, which they should have enhanced to simulate the original TECHNICOLOR look in which the shadows are really black but at the same time keeping the details. On an IB-TECHNICOLOR prints, the faces of Jimmy Stuart and Kim Novak really pop out of the darkness, allowing the audience to understand the incridible dramatic conflict of the scene....but on the &quot;restoration&quot;, you see vertually nothing except the darkness.The biggest problem is the sound. In order to create a digital DTS sound track, they removed all the original sound effects, and replaced with new effects created on folleys. They must have done the best they could, but still those new sound effects are so annoying, and it destroys the atmosphere and emotions of the film. They just sound noisy. The original version of the film had a soundtrack which is much more subtle, which creates a beautiful dreamy, moody atmosphere totally in the spirit of the film. Bernard Herrmann's beautiful music (probably the best music ever written for a film) suffers a lot because of that, which is a real pitty.Since the DVD format allows to have many different sound tracks, it would have been nice if they could keep the original monaural sound as an additional track. Then those who are in favor of the more &quot;modern&quot; digital sound can have their fun, while those who has a deeper, true understanding of the film could fully enjoy Hitchcock's masterpiece, truly in its original form (Hitchcock had never intended to make this film in stereo anyway).I am very afraid that from now on, people will missunderstand that this is the standard version of VERTIGO. It simply is not. It is a much much much more beautiful film",N/A
397890,"Elegant soirees, fashion shoots, strolls about Paris, romance, witty dialogue - this movie has it all.  An amazingly strong cast graces this light-hearted romantic comedy that also has a wonderful soundtrack.  The  music truly adds another sweeping dimension to the film.  Julia Ormond is  stunning yet sweet as Sabrina, and her transformation from the dowdy,  lovelorn adolescent to glamorous sophisticate was very well done.  Her  quiet, smooth voice opens the movie and flows over tranquil scenes of the  luxurious Larrabee estate, Harrison Ford is the stoic Linus Larrabee the  cold, sharp businessman (&quot;the world's only living heart-donor&quot;)  who learns to love under the gentle guidance of a mature and wise Sabrina.  Greg Kinnear is an extremely likable David, the younger son.  Nancy  Marchand is a hoot as Maude, the matriarch, who dons some rather elaborate  evening gowns!  John Wood is a most distinguished chauffeur, and audiences  will respect him more than the original.  Even Mac, the loyal, ever so  efficient secretary, has some great one-liners.The original made me  squirm with Hepburn's portrayal of an embarrassingly  immature, unbalanced  Sabrina.  The remake stresses her psychological maturing (&quot;I found  myself in Paris&quot;) in addition to the physical makeover.  More  importantly, Bogart and Hepburn didn't give me the same thrill that Ford  and Ormond do.  I think they really enjoyed making this movie together -  their shared smiles and laughter on Martha's Vineyard and in the Moroccan  restaurant seemed genuine.  It's more than good acting.  I know several  will disagree with me, but even those who prefer the original have to admit  that the scenes in Paris, beautifully shot on location, are a vast  improvement to the old version.  This movie is one of my favorites, and I'm  glad others see the merit in this remake and aren't dismissing it as  readily as the critics did.",Sabrina VHS

In fact, &quot;House Of Usher&quot; is not only a  straight thriller, it is also a very poetic movie, it has a good script, a  haunting score (especially in the crypt sequence) and a very well crafted  set design (just watch Corman`s opulent use of colors). If the climax is  somewhat hurried it is more than made up by the frightening atmosphere of  the film. When I watched it as a child in the early eighties, it was one of  the few old chillers that really scared me to death ..... and it will  certainly entertain everyone who enjoys to watch really good vintage horror  thrillers (Vincent Price`s morbid characterization of Roderick Usher is  worth a few shocks alone).",N/A

With instruments and forms of music virtually  unaffected by 40 years of pop culture, these superlative musicians will  warm you with their humility and their affection for each other and their  culture, and then thrill you will their rich music.  Cooder, however, did  the musicians a disservice by giving himself and his son such a big  role  in the project.  Cooder's electric guitar doesn't work when it is mixed  with thick, natural sound of the Cuban musicians.  Director Win Wenders  shot a brilliant sequence when legendary pianist Ruben Gonzalez is working  magic on his piano and Cooder interjects with his electric guitar.  Wenders  moves the camera amongst the Cuban musicians while Cooder is playing and  they all have perplexed looks on their faces.  It is a sound that they  obviously are not accustomed to and one that clashes with their natural  sounds.  It's also painful to watch Cooder's son head and shoulder  movements while he plays percussion -- it's something straight out of a  Wayans brother movie.I don't want to seem ungrateful.  Full credit goes  to Cooder for what he has done for these performers and the music world.  These performers obviously have deep affection for Cooder.

Martin Sheen arrives on the island, with strict  orders in hand that the monks obey the Vatican, no questions asked.  How  the monks dramatize their grievances against the Holy See is not, however,  the true climax of the film.

Sheen wonders  why he hasn't requested a transfer or retirement.  Howard tells him how  important he and the other monks are to the islanders, and that their  community work is more important than his inability to pray.  By the close  of the film, with Sheen exiting in his Helicopter as all the monks are  gathered below, buffetted by the wake of the propeller blades, the very  real and moving drama of one man's crisis of faith, made all the more  moving by Trevor Howard, becomes painfully real for us.",The Conflict

Cut next to the Father, who announces that he will be dead a year from now  -- he intones this while doing something unmentionable  (on Amazon)  in the  shower.  Flashy enough for you?

Not only  does this cheap trick waste time, it's dishonest:  why can't we see what  the Spacey character is REALLY thinking about?

Although it might be self-contradictory in that it &quot;adds to  the problem&quot;, as well as Stone's belonging to the media, which was the  film's sole source of attack, &quot;Natural Born Killers&quot; had a  positive influence on me.  It shocked me not merely for it's violence,  which is very extreme, but because of how little people notice how deeply  they are interested in it.  My original intention for renting &quot;Natural  Born Killers&quot; was to see how violent it really was.

For one thing, there's not much difference from the tape  set and the DVD, with the exceptions of a 5.1 soundtrack, audio commentary,  and a Nine Inch Nails music video that is missing on the DVD, but is  included on the tape.  The biggest drawback is that the DVD is not  anamorphically enhanced.  For a brand new DVD, anamorphic enhancement  should be a must.  The transfer is derived from the letterboxed edition  used to make the laserdisc and the tape, which has some faults in it.

Though I must say that some of the other acting was rather dry  to say the least. Mr. Prichett in particular was just plain irratating. On  the positive side, there is a catching story line (upright captain has to  fight his best friend in order to keep him from setting off a nuclear  bomb). The action is good. As I said, Travolta's acting is great;  practically carries the film. The final word, I really enjoyed it, but can  easilly see why most others wouldn't. I'd suggest renting it. You never  know, you may like it and choose to by it.",N/A

203858,"A highly successful technical experiment.  This was Hitchcock's first color film, shot on one set in (almost) one unbroken shot.  Pretty amazing when you consider that the cameras of that time were not nearly as portable as those of today.  The set had to be constructed with walls that were movable to accomodate the movements of the camera, and those movements had to be accomplished silently because the production used actual real-time sound.  Pay attention to the lighting as well; a panoramic cityscape was constructed for the set and the lighting technicians simulate a sunset as the action unfolds.The performers are outstanding as well, particularly James Stewart and John Dall.  Real tension is generated as the players confront and confound each other while Hitchcock's roving camera moves through the room, always alert for the telling detail.  Classic.",N/A

But it's not for the faint-of-heart or the easily offended. My fiancee I think would refuse to watch it because while the female lead is a strong character, she gets kind of manhandled at times which is unfortunate.

311788,"I thanked the man at Central Park who introduced &quot;84 Charing Cross Road&quot; to Anne Bancroft and Mel Brooks for help making it into a film. David Hugh Jones did a splendid directing.  Marvellous adaptation of Helene Hanff's book which I cherish. Without this film I may never find such a terrific book. Great contribution to books-lovers and movie-goers.I love this film.It's one of my all time favourite! Very literary unique with exquisite performances from Anne Bancroft and Anthony Hopkins.This bitter sweet true story is about lifelong letters correspondence between a struggling writer Helene Hanff(Bancroft) and a book dealer Frank Doel(Hopkins). It began when Helene, a New Yorker responded to an advertisement in the &quot;Saturday Review of Literature&quot;. She wanted to mail order out of prints or cheaper edition old books from a London book shop which Frank worked as a book dealer. The book shop was located in 84 Charing Cross Road. At first everything were strictly business like. Helene was always interested and amazed by English Literature and cultures and Frank vice-versa,intrigue by this American. Eventually,they developed a special friendship,an unspoken love and care for each other without even seeing each other. They were like soul mates and that was extraordinary.The cultural and social differences between London and New York during that period were vividly illustrated.  It's so touching to see Helene finally going to London.Her love for english literature was sincere and remarkable. This made the movie so unforgettable and great. Beacause all these actually did happened and those people really existed.Both Anne Bancroft and Anthony Hopkins were astonishing in their roles. Also with great supporting casts like Judi Dench and Maurice Denham.This movie taught me about books,the magic of literature,friendship and many more.It also showed there are many different kind of perpetual love and care. I'll always re-watch it because I find it's a classic which touch my heart and soul.",N/A

235456,"Although director Elia Kazan ultimately failed in this uneven if brilliant attempt to bring his best-selling semi-autobiographical novel to the  screen, it is a wonderful sociological portrait of a man driven to the edge  of madness and despair by what material and career success does to his  soul. Kirk Douglas is terrific as Eddie Anderson, the deeply conflicted  Greek-American second-generation crossover who buys into the pursuit of  American business success and now feels as though his talent and creativity  have been totally corrupted and squandered in pursuit of the bitch goddess  of success. He has it all, money, sex, and power, and all the toys and  accessories such material success means. But his life is increasingly ashes  in his mouth, a bitter, lonely, empty and unfulfilling existence that is  literally driving Eddie insane.We watch enraptured as he plunges  head-first into a disastrous mid-life crisis, spiraling dangerously down  the slippery slope toward madness and involuntary commitment, until slowly  and painfully he begins to figure out what is wrong and how to fix it,  although all this is obviously done at an amazingly hurtful and  angst-filled cost to himself and his loved ones. Deborah Kerr co-stars as  his loving but also self-concerned and controlling wife, and Faye Dunaway  turns in a compelling performance as the insightful and sarcastic love  interest who draws him out of his mid-life diversions and makes him see how  expensive his sell-out has been to the real Eddie underneath all the glitz  and glamour.They say this movie had it all in the can, but that somehow  author/producer/director Elia Kazan blew it all by cutting and editing it  terribly, leaving it disjointed and hard-to-follow. Even though this seems  to be true, the movie is uneven but still quite good, with a number of  intense and moving scenes with Douglas, Dunaway, Kerr and Richard Boone  that are among the best dramatic footage I have ever seen. Watch for the  scenes late in the film when Eddie tries to explain himself and his actions  to his wife, tryng to verbalize the very complicated reasons he simply  cannot work at the ad agency any more. Although she coaxs him into the  monologue, promising him she'll do &quot;ANYTHING, god-dammit!&quot; to  make him happy, in the end she is quite conflicted, as well, and as a  result totally misunderstands him, discounting his problems and conflicts  and not hearing his plaintive pleas because she really doesn't want to give  up their privileged lifestyle. He pours out his heart and needs, but she  isn't listening, reacting angrily instead to what she sees as his  selfishness even though she has begged him to be honest about what he  really wants.Such powerful scenes honestly and accurately document the  terrible failed attempts at critical communication that too often  characterize the destruction of life-long relationships and tragic divorce.  Richard Boone of the TV series &quot;Have Gun, Will Travel&quot;, an old  Douglas friend and associate, also turns in a wonderful performance as  Eddie's domineering and senile Greek-immigrant father, a once successful  rug-importer who torments Eddie because he wants Eddie to bankroll him for  another chance to control his own life. The way all this spins together was  the powerful driving stuff behind a best-selling novel. The movie isn't  quite as good, but it is still a wonderful, entertaining and powerful drama  eminently worth watching.",N/A

93402,"That day America lost charismatic leadership elected by the people in  favor of secret government. After WWII, we realized we could not ever be  caught unprepared for war in a nuclear age, so we continued on in a state  of ""cold"" war. JFK wanted to change this in the middle of the  ""Cold War""; bad timing for sure. All of those that quibble (look  the word up) about Stone's details or pronounce the ""LHO did it""  have never fired a weapon in U.S. military service, least of all a cruddy  Mannlicher-Carcano. Get one and just try manipulating the bolt fast enough  for 3 shots. Then try aiming and proper breathing/trigger control. Next,  watch the head of JFK react backwards from a frontal shot in Stone's  showing of the Zapruder film, proving a frontal shot from a second gunman.  Next ponder on the FACT that the next U.S. Government assasination  investigation concluded it WAS a conspiracy requiring 2 or more gunmen. The  official U.S. Government position is that there WAS A CONSPIRACY. The  Warren Commission misconclusion has been superseded. Now what are YOU going  to do about it?The point is the people of America have become cowards,  the secret government knows that it has to do all our dirty work because we  certainly will not do it. This is why they knew they could remove the  elected President by coup d'etat and get away with it, as they then  proceeded to kill RFK, MLK, Malcolm-X and George Wallace, don't forget they  shot Reagen, too---anyone who offered a shimmer of hope of ""being his  own man"" while in public office/position of visibility that could  awaken the lazy Gen-Me/X/Y generations.What died that day in Dallas was  the belief that a charismatic leader could inspire the populace of America  to get involved in our government. Since that time its been all ""down  hill"".  And who is to blame?We are.When we become more  intelligent as Stone's films can make us realize the nature of things, then  we can take a more active role in government without the secret caretakers  of this Republic getting alarmed and feel like they have to assassinate us.  It took a tremendous amount of courage for Oliver Stone to make this film,  and I salute everyone in the cast, too. The point of this film is to be a  charismatic THINKING leader in your own right and not let the ""bad  people scare you"" as Garrison tells his children.Stone shows why  the men who killed JFK were angry at him, and they have good reasons for  their wrong doing. Still makes it wrong, but ""good people"" can do  bad things. Look at Nazi Germany--we are not immune from mob or  group-think. You don't offer to disarm in the face of world communism. See  Stone's Nixon and this will be clear, too. However, the conspirators that  killed our charismatic leaders are wrong because America needs people of  charisma holding things together at every level, they alone can't do it  all. If they wanted JFK out of office, see to it that he was voted, not  SHOT out of office. What we have here today is a slow death of America at  many levels by a pervading lack of trust in the people in our government,  partially because we cannot seem to elect good people into office or if we  did, not have them shot out.The movie clearly poses the question of  whether we are going to continue as a nation based on just a war footing  run by others or are we going to stop being selfish consumerists content to  let others handle the pressing matters of the nation? Or will we like  Garrison/JFK seek and find the truth, dare to be different and spend our  lives doing things far more interesting like space colonization and make  that our nation's reason for existance? We need a competent  military-industrial complex or we will not survive as a nation, but we will  not survive long if we don't get an enlightened citizenry that is able to  understand the complexities of the world (not quibble in order to sit on  one's rear) and assume the responsibility of our nation without disarming  in the face of the external enemy. The internal enemies are tougher. I  think we know who they are. We have met the enemy and he is us.",JFK Director's Cut
404617,"This adventure, featuring council estates, city squallor and grim reality, demonstrates how the series had moved on in its 26 years.The gritty portrayal of Ace's home of Perrivale provides a good contrast to the  science-fantasy atmosphere of the Planet of the Cheetah People.  The  Ace/Doctor double-act is at its best here, there is are some superb pieces  of dialogue and dark undertones, and Anthony Ainley is at last playing an  alternative incarnation of the Master rather than a parody of Roger  Delgado's version.  The Master's sense of emotion and desperation in this  story provides a new angle on the character and makes it a shame this was  to be Ainley's last appearance in the series.The Cheetah people do,  admittedly, appear to be on the cheesy side, but they are saved by their  portrayal and some stunning camerawork.

402525,"Bunuel made this film after &quot;Belle du Jour,&quot; using Catherine Deneuve as the heroine for both films.  Whereas &quot;Belle du Jour&quot;  was a foretaste of the sophisticated, chic French movies he made in the  seventies, &quot;Tristana&quot; is in some ways a throwback to the rough,  psychologically disturbing Spanish movies he made in the fifties and  sixties.  Both modes have their advantages, but for depth of feeling and  psychological insight his Spanish films are clearly better.  (His French  films are more subtly satirical and international in scope, but he seems to  have put less of his personal obsessions in them than in the films made in  his native Spanish idiom.  Or, rather, in the French films the obsessions  now have the streamlined pedigree endowed upon them by the international  film community's recognition of the World's Greatest Spanish Director.)  Fernando Rey is the quintessential Spanish gentleman--a little bit of  brutishness mixed in with the refinement--but he also gets to suggest  emotional depths here (and in &quot;Viridiana&quot;) that he did not in his  other films with Bunuel where he seemed merely slyly charming and debonair.  His desperate passion for Deneuve's Tristana is the emotional center of  the film, despite the title's emphasis on the heroine.  Deneuve's beauty  is, of course, flawless and this suits Tristana's early stages when she's  sweet, innocent, naive.  But Deneuve's ice princess qualities prevent her  from growing into the passion for the young artist (Franco Nero) that  signal her growth as a woman.  Both Rey and Nero register their emotions in  a fierce animal way that is perhaps more purely Spanish (or Italian in  Nero's case) than Deneuve's rarefied French blood will allow.  She seems  too cold and refined for big emotions.  She's effective in the latter  scenes where the script calls for her to become a coldhearted perverse  witch, rudely dismissing a friendly greeting in the park in Toledo or  scandalously exposing herself to the deaf mute son of her servant.  But we  don't see the hatred for Rey eating away at her that would allow her to  have her final victory over him.  We don't see the rage of this young girl  toward the men who have let her down:  first Rey for bringing her as a  young girl into his household as his mistress, then Nero for allowing her  to experience passion but disappointing her by returning her to Rey when  she gets ill (she says to Nero, &quot;Lope [Rey] would never have done  that&quot;--i.e., he's too proud and by implication more of a man).  And  then rage at Rey again for being stuck with him as his mistress for the  rest of her years.  When she condescends to marry Rey for appearances'  sake, she cruelly laughs at his expectation that their union will be  consummated.  She's saying to him, &quot;You silly man.  I married you to  please a priest and to inherit your wealth; don't delude yourself that I  care about you.&quot;  The dramatic situation is fascinating and it's  somewhat frustrating that it's not entirely realized, largely due to  Deneuve's limitations as an actress.  Still, there have been few directors  other than Bunuel who could bring so much to the material without softening  it and sentimentalizing it.  His style here is the plain, non-fussy  technique that made him infamous (allegedly, he was once offered Fellini's  cinematographer but turned him down in favor of the pedestrian camera work  of a fellow Spaniard).  Bunuel's style is an affront on bourgeois  expectations of a rich mise-en-scene or a style that calls attention to its  own artistic, innovative qualities.  It can be slow going and even seem  boring in the beginning stages, but in the best of Bunuel--as in  &quot;Tristana&quot;--it can reward the patient viewer with psychological  revelations of a truth uncommonly encountered on the screen.",Tristana VHS

Get a kick out of Lorne Green as a heart attack victim being strapped in an office chair, lowered from the 50th floor to the 45th (or whatever it was).  People really do these things in real life.

For example, what could be more ironic than a  secret fraternity of doctors holding mystic, candle-lit initiation rituals  during which they swear to uphold the scientific method?

I can't imagine anyone regretting the purchase of this DVD.This disc's picture quality and sound demonstrate what ought to be  done, but usually isn't, to some of the older classic movies now appearing  on DVD. Sound has been remastered into full Dolby Digital. Picture quality  is so fine it's difficult to believe that this could have been better  experienced in the theater.The obvious companion piece to this is the  documentary of the making of the film by Coppola's wife, &quot;Hearts of  Darkness: A Filmmaker's Apocalypse&quot;. If you haven't seen that, you  need to. It's a fascinating piece even if you haven't seen Apocalypse  Now.There are a couple of goodies on the disc, including an alternate  stand-alone ending of the airstrike coming in on the Kurtz temple and some  excerpts from the original theatrical program, but this is nothing compared  to all the goodies you can get by watching Hearts of Darkness.Knowing  about all that extra information and some deleted scenes shown in Hearts of  Darkness, I wonder why some of that material (indeed, why not put the whole  documentary on the disc, or make it purchasable as a double set?) wasn't  included on this disc. For that reason, I refrain from a fifth  star.Quality of the movie itself and quality of the transfer to DVD are  surely five stars, however. Perfect.On a completely irrelevant side  note, it would be nice if Coppola pulled a George Lucas on this film and  rereleased it with some digital enhancements, such as the addition of the  extra choppers he wanted in the chopper attack scene and a redoing of some  of the awful artificial shadowing on Brando's face in the ending scenes.

510150,"THE STENDHAL SYNDROME[La Sindrome di Stendhal](Italy - 1995)Aspect ratio: 1.66:1Theatrical soundtrack: Dolby DigitalQuite unlike anything Dario Argento has directed before, THE STENDHAL SYNDROME is a grimly realistic portrait of a female  police officer (Asia Argento, essentially miscast) whose encounters with a sadistic rapist/serial killer (Thomas Kretschmann) have devastating consequences. Though distinguished by some truly horrific violence, played straight by Argento with few of his trademark stylistic flourishes, the film is much too languid for its own good, wasting a lot of valuable time on an otherwise laudable attempt to depict the long-term consequences of a vicious sexual assault on the central character. Furthermore, the harsh  subject matter allows no room for levity, and the austere scenario is at odds with the sumptuous artwork that acts as a catalyst for the murderous proceedings. Asia's convulsive reactions to works of art (hence the ornate title) makes her a target for Kretschmann's psychopathic killer, allowing Argento to fill the screen with paintings, sculptures and beautiful objet d'art, which offsets the film's own lack of visual flair.But there's a fierce intelligence underpinning the somewhat predictable scenario: When Asia de-emphasizes her femininity in response to the initial attack, only to re-establish her womanhood after a second assault in which she emerges the victor (or does she?), it becomes easier to forgive the painfully obvious surprises which clog up the final quarter. Only one scene recalls the best of Argento's work: A potential victim being stalked through a dimly lit room full of oversized marble statues, a brilliantly edited  sequence which suggests everything and reveals nothing. Overall, ""Stendhal"" may not be vintage Argento, but it's too clever and too unsettling to be easily dismissed, and it gets under the skin like no other horror film in recent memory.

But how many out there actually remember what its original source is, or for that matter, how good a film &quot;The Spy Who  Loved Me&quot; actually was?  This movie is the pinacle of the Roger Moore  era and features his best performance as 007.  But that is only the tip of  the iceberg.

269249,"Prior to the legendary performance by George C. Scott in PATTON, my only exposure to this great actor had been THE FLIM-FLAM MAN, released in 1967. I actually saw it at a drive-in movie, which, for those too young to remember, was essentially a parking lot with a huge screen at one end. Patrons paid at an entrance kiosk, drove in, parked next to a speaker mounted at each parking space, and watched the show (unless, as might happen with young couples, hormone levels dictated inattention to the plot).Scott plays Mordecai Jones, Master of Back-Stabbin', Cork-Screwin' and Dirty Double-Dealin'. While unfortunately regarded as a con artist by the general populace, he maintains that he profits only from the greed of others, and that an honest man can't be taken advantage of. In this comedy, his wanderings have brought him to the South, where he hooks up with Curley, a young Army deserter played by Michael Sarrazin. Along the way, the world savvy Mordecai teaches Curley lessons about life, while together they successfully fleece some of the region's less upright citizens. A basically decent kid, Curley suffers pangs of conscience over their scams, but remains sufficiently undebilitated to fall in love with a cutie played by Sue Lyon, daughter of a local Prominent Citizen.The film has a marvelous cast of character actors familiar to Baby Boomers: Jack Albertson, Strother Martin, Albert Salmi, Slim Pickens, and Harry Morgan. Morgan (otherwise remembered as Joe Friday's partner on TV's DRAGNET, and as Colonel Potter on TV's MASH), is particularly good as the local-yokel sheriff out to nab our two heroes.THE FLIM-FLAM MAN is a gentle, humorous fairy tale played out on a stage that could never exist. For instance, nary a single black is encountered as the story unfolds. And this is below the Mason-Dixon Line? However, that shouldn't detract from the affection that the viewer will feel for the wily and wise Mordecai, who is certainly a rascal, but a surprisingly honorable one. Light entertainment? Most assuredly. But, it doesn't get any better than this.",The Flim Flam Man VHS

She is being courted by an American soldier, Captain Pringle (John Lund).On her way to Berlin is Phoebe Frost (Jean Arthur), an icy woman from America, who is going to record her visit and report back to the government.

158228,"&quot;May the Force Be With You Always&quot;Obi-One KenobiGeorge Lucas's unforgettable Star Wars is one of the most influential, mythically engaging, and highly enjoyable science fiction films of all time. Though it  can be said that Lucas borrowed cinematic ideas from Akira Kurosaka (Hidden  Fortress), Howard Hawks, and John Ford (The Searchers). Does Star Wars  really deserve to be called too simplistic or underserving of all it's  popularity? NO NO NO! , Star Wars is modern film myth that has engaged its  fans in its timeless tale for the last 23 years. What the Star Wars Haters  need to realize is that we the fans find this wonderful myth of good, evil,  fate, and destiny to be one of the most enlightening and blissful voyages  that the movies have ever given us. Star Wars is a tribute to the power and  expressiveness of the movies. What make Star Wars so superior to the  numerous clones that followed it is despite its magnificent special  effects, that defined a new age in Sci/Fi, the film's characters, mythos,  and epic story are what made Star Wars so universally accepted and beloved  around the world. Not only have the characters of Luke Skywalker, Darth  Vader, Han Solo, and R2D2 become permanent parts of movie culture. The  simple yet important moral that good will eventually overcome all evil no  matter the time, suffering, loss, or failure involved makes Star Wars the  modern equivalent of the Wizard of Oz. It tells it's tale simply and  elequently. It moves us with its images and people. It takes us to a time  and place that will never leave the boundries of our memory. Star Wars is  joy to behold, and anyone who feels otherwise is too stuck up to see the  beauty of a universe a long time ago in a galaxy far far away. Star Wars  Fans: May the Force Always Be With Each and Every One of You. I can't wait  to see all the episodes on DVD.",Star Wars Trilogy THX Digitally Mastered Edition
154576,"In the film Dead End, the murky waters of Manhattan's East River served as an appropriate backdrop for the squalor that manifested itself within the conefines of tenament housing.  City streets that offered little hope for  the jobless, poor, and oppressed were truely &quot;dead ends&quot;.  Written by Lillian Hellman and directed by William Wyler, Dead End exposed  the stark social and economic divisions between the affluent and the  underpriveledged.  Logistically, the film was easily adapted from Sidney  Kingsley's stage play, as most of the scenes are shot within the shadows of  Manhattan's East 53rd street highrises. Dead End is essentially about  people and their relationship with the neighborhood that spawned them.  Gangster Baby Face Martin ( Humphrey Bogart) returns to his old block  seeking glorified acceptance from his mother, only to be rudely rebuffed.  Plastic surgery may conceal Martin's outward identity, but his crimminal  persona is clearly defined through his street wise and violent attitude  towards survival. At first Martin basks in the limelight; preening with  sharp suit, hat, and polished shoes.  As if to make a social statement  exclaiming the virtues and rewards of crime, Martin becomes an icon for a  teenage street gang (The Dead End Kids).  When Martin is shocked by his  mother's repulsive behavior, he seeks out his old flame (Clair Trevor).  When she reveals that she is now a prostitute, Martin once again becomes  tormented  that his homecoming is a lonely one.  Sylvia Sydney plays Drina,  a young unemployed woman struggling to forge an identity of her own while  raising her teenage brother.  Drina can only dream about escaping the  confines of her depressing neighborhood, since her childhood beau ( Joel  McCrea) has been enticed by a society girl ( Wendy Barrie) who resides in  an exclusive penthouse overlooking the shoddy apartments that define Dead  End. Huntz Hall, Gabriel Dell, Leo Gorcey, and the rest of the Dead End  kids provide enough street talk to make an English teacher cringe with  embarrassment. Is there a way out of Dead End? Most street toughs assumed a  life of crime would free them from poverty.  Others set up businesses  relying on the patronage of tenanment residents to keep the bills paid.  Others relied on marriage in hopes of &quot;marrying up&quot;.  Still  others sought education as a way out.  The year is 2000, and if you visit  the streets of Manhattan above 110th street not much has changed since  Wyler's 1937 film Dead End.",N/A

445834,"Mario Bava's BLACK SABBATH (original Italian title--THE THREE FACES OF FEAR) is easily one of my favorite DVD releases this year, both in terms of  the new transfer and the film itself.Like Bava's earlier BLACK SUNDAY,  this film was re-edited by AIP for its American release, and it is that  version which we've always seen in the US. The original Italian version  plays the episodes in a different order: &quot;The Telephone,&quot;  &quot;The Wurdalak&quot; and &quot;The Drop of Water.&quot; The lesbian  content of &quot;The Telephone&quot; was of course toned down for American  audiences. It also has a prologue and epilogue which are different from  those shot for the American release. You may find that the comic epilogue  doesn't fit with the rest of the picture, but I enjoyed its  self-deprecating humor. The original score by Roberto Nicolosi supports the  mood of the film better than Les Baxter's AIP score and it subtly ties the  three episodes together through recurring thematic material. If you've only  seen this film in the AIP version, you really owe it to yourself to see the  original Italian version-there IS a difference.The letterboxed DVD  transfer looks beautiful. The print is worn in places, but the colors are  vivid and the rich details of the set design come through. Having known the  film only from a cropped VHS transfer, watching the DVD was like seeing a  new film altogether. Indeed, Bava's masterful use of lighting, color and  camera movement, his eye for dramatic detail, only confirms what a  brilliant director he was. From a purely stylistic standpoint, this is one  of the great horror films. Tim Lucas, as usual, provides informative liner  notes.",Black Sabbath VHS
511896,"Andy Kaufman's style of entertainment erased lines between himself and his audience.

275789,"I have not seen the DVD of this movie, but will comment on the movie itself:With a movie based around dogs running a gambling (rat races) and bar joint, it already earns coolness factor among children's fare. As a child of about 9 when this movie was originally released (ten years ago) these references went straight over my head.  Strangely the movie is still entertaining, although slipping a bit into typical heartwarming stuff after the introduction of the little girl into the mix (who is being held by Charlie's - the German Shephard-like lead dog voiced wonderfully by Burt Reynolds - nemesis, Carface because she can talk to animals and thus know who will win the day's race.)Set in New Orleans, the main plot (which the rest is filler really) is Charlie and his partner Itchy return to the joint that Charlie and Carface used to run together (up until Charlie was thrown into the clinker - the dog pound - until Itchy got him out, the great escape is where the movie begins) and under the guise of helping Charlie set up his own place, Carface holds a party at Mardi Gras where Charlie gets a little too sloshed and makes him an easy target for a cleancut murder.  All dogs go to heaven of course despite the fact there's little record of our lead actually doing any good in his earthly canine life, but heaven wasn't good enough for Charlie, he wants revenge, so he steals his watch of life, winds it back up and heads back down for Vengeance upon the ones who has done him wrong.  That's when his life gets entangled with the little orphan girl (called &quot;Squeaker&quot; by him through most of the movie after a rather cute scene which I won't spoil here), who he 'rescues' for 'using' her for his own selfish purposes instead of helping the child realize her dreams, but his coming to care for her in turn ends up leading to his own true salvation.A very 'dark' film, in lighting and sometimes even in story, there's many morals to be found underneath, the biggest being that even imperfect people (or animals) have goodness in their heart, they only have to reach out and open their hearts to find it.  The badguys are truly bad although the lead villan's Chihuahua looking scrapgoat shows a kinder side sometimes, and are played out kind of like mobsters and not too over-the-top.  There are no ridiculous ambitions, simply the doing in of Charlie so that his claim to the business is his void (he'd be dead afterall), which is a refreshing pace from superhero movies.  The voice acting is very good in most cases, and a couple of the songs don't even make adults cringe too much (especially the one in heaven is quite nice).A well done film throughout, which spawned a mediocre sequel and animated series.  However, there's no substitute for the original, which is one of the best animated movies to come out of the 90s period.  Children will love it, and adults will be able to watch it without feeling too ill or out of place, and those that grew up on it, probably still hold it close to their hearts.",N/A
450553,"Once again, we have Gwyneth Paltrow delving into the world of the Brits and sporting an English accent in a story where the director's view seems to be that regardless of the circumstances, fate still plays a vital role  in the final outcome. It is an experiment of the rhetoric &quot;What  if...?&quot;, a splicing of two cells containing scenarios, and their  embryotic outcomes spawning as the film progresses. It begins with our lab  rat (Helen Quilley) leaving her place of employment after she's just been  fired. The cell-dividing begins when she heads for the subway and the two  scenarios are shown consecutively where first she misses the train, and the  second half where she catches it at the last moment. In scenario two, she  arrives home to a cheating boyfriend (a despicable, weak-minded weasel  played convincingly by John Lynch) in mid-coitus with his old lover Lydia,  who is portrayed with amusing fury by Jeanne Tripplehorn. In the previous  scenario, she is forced to walk home after missing the train and is mugged,  taking a trip to the local emergency room and buying time for Gerry (the  cheating boyfriend) to usher Lydia out of the apartment.Where it goes  from there, the scenarios are easily distinguishable. The jilted Helen  packs her bags and moves in with her feisty Irish girlfriend Anna (great  performance by Zara Turner) and cuts her hair, dying it blonde. She then  attaches herself to a new boyfriend with a thick, Scottish accent free of  fabrication named James (great comedic timing on the part of John Hannah).  Both stories have their similarities, which you will see when watching are  the hands of fate working their magic even though the circumstances are  different.I have to give a hand to the writers of this screenplay for  the great one-liners that came out of this movie and the overall snappy wit  of each character. You even have your comedy relief in the form of Gerry's  wisecracking friend Russell, played by Douglas McFerran.This film had a  very good cast and I was intrigued by the premise, but my only problem was  Gwyneth's accent. Yes, she does it better than most, but compared to people  who really did have an English accent, she needs a little more practice  before she can even have Americans fooled. Other than that small detail,  this is a very entertaining and very humorous movie, despite its  surprisingly dour ending.",N/A

308635,"I can only review this film because of its subject matter, which is of central interest to a society on the verge of forgetting entirely where it came from (much less knowing where it is going). So because it is so  important a story, however badly the film itself has been handled has to be  partly overlooked.Set in Amazonia, the film bears some remarkable  similarities to ""Black Robe,"" the Canadian historical film of some years  ago. Both films deal with ""first contact"" with the natives, and in so  doing, they present a cinematographically rich portrait of native cultures.  One wonders if they are not overdone in fact; the details of costuming  (sic) and decor are extravagantly attended to. Indeed, that is where the  film falls down for me: too much attention to detail and a complete loss of  rapport with the viewer in the meantime, as the main story gets lost as  much as any explorer ever did in any jungle. In addition, the impact of  this film's occasionally grandiose photography is (as in ""Black Robe"")  somewhat lost on the television screen.There are entire sections that  might be cut right out of this unnecessarily long film. So from the  beginning, we have to deal with a poor script, which has us undergo all  sorts of very unsatisfactory gimmicks and complications. Planes almost, but  not quite, fly into waterfalls; an Indian trips on the local soma and goes  bananas... In the best Hollywood tradition, nothing is allowed to happen in  an ordinary way. The story is loud and stops and starts fitfully, obviously  uncertain of its direction. The European actors are third rate and quite  unbelievable. The natives, at least, who must have felt somewhat more at  home in this exotic location, are an improvement. And there the story lies,  with whatever interest anybody might take from the overall picture: the  natives are being dispossessed as fast as land can be cleared for cattle to  graze on so we in North America can eat plenty of hamburgers. It's an old  story now, but has anything changed? This is taken from the book of the  same name, written by the very fine author, Peter Matthiessen. Pity he  didn't write the scenario as well.",N/A
475955,"The common theme running through George Lucas' work is visual genius  marked by artistic laziness.  Like most geniuses, Lucas works best within a  limited palette of expertise.  If you want stunning visuals and bombastic  sound, he's your man.  If you want a storyline with some level of  sophistication beyond Saturday morning cartoons, it's best to look  elsewhere.Star Wars fans (and I consider myself one) can whine all  they want, but childishness is an inherent part of Lucas' cinematic ouevre.Whenever Lucas steps away from the controls and lets someone else drive  the plot, the results are as amazing as &quot;The Empire Strikes  Back&quot;, the hands-down favorite of most Star Wars fans.  When George is  actively engaged in the script, we get dreck like the Ewoks and Phantom  Menace's Jar Jar Binks.&quot;Episode I-The Phantom Menace&quot; could  never live up to its prerelease hype in any event, but with Lucas firmly in  command the movie is even more execrable than may otherwise have been the  case.  How bad is it?- The incoherent plot involves some nonsense  about interstellar trade regulations- The Force, previously a kind of  New Age mysticism, now seemingly stems from a parasitic infection- The  main force for good is a 14-year old &quot;elected queen&quot; of a planet  named Naboo, of all things, who spends much of the movie in Kabuki makeup  speaking in desultory monotone- The villain never speaks a word, and  seemingly exists for the sole purpose of having a lightsaber duel with two  of the heroes- A major character actually chooses slavery over freedom,  mainly as a cheap way to write her out of subsequent scenes- Unlike Luke  Skywalker, who had a painful and awkward apprenticeship before emergind as  a full-blown hero in &quot;Return of the Jedi&quot;, Anakin Skywalker is  invincible from the word go, despite being only 9 years oldThe movie is  a colossal disappointment, and not just due to the inflated expectations of  fans.  While a number of the visuals are simply stunning, the plot is a  total mess, which substantially undermines the movie's impact.  The final  victory comes so cheaply and ridiculously as to serve as a sort of parody  of the first film (imagine Luke destroying the Death Star in a Landspeeder  while on the way to Tachi Station to look at some power convertors and  you'll see what I mean).Fans hope against hope that the second  installment will counter this trend and restore some sense of menace to the  series.

Baoh reminds me in some ways of &quot;Guyver&quot;  in that he is an organic superhero with all sorts of fun abilities. It's  somewhat mindless, and as I said before, quite light on the plot and  character development, but surprisingly enjoyable anyway. An interesting  touch is that Baoh apparently cannot speak when transformed, although they  sometimes allow the audience to hear his thoughts.I found the voice  acting average. Both Walken and the head of Doress overacted their parts  terribly, especially the latter, but most of the rest were competent if not  overwhelming. Music was also eminently forgettable, but appropriate for  whatever scene it was in. Also somewhat lacking was character development.  All the characters were pretty much stock for the genre, but I list that as  a neutral factor. If they weren't riveting, at least they weren't boring or  stupid.I said it before, and I'll say it again. As animation goes, it's  one of the best I've ever seen.

460475,"How do you make a funny movie using a morgue and prostitution as subject matter?  Leave it to screenwriters Lowell Ganz and Babaloo Mandel, who put a rollicking script in the hands of director Ron Howard, who ran with it  and ended up scoring a minor comedy classic with ""Night Shift.""  Chuck  Lumley (Henry Winkler) is in something of a funk; he's been relegated to  the night shift at the morgue where he's worked for years, thanks to the  nepotism of his boss, who has installed a nephew into Chuck's day shift.  Now Chuck has to train the new man, one Bill Blazejowski (Michael Keaton) a  real ""idea man"" who can't sit still and never seems to quit talking, much  to the chagrin of the conservative Chuck, who likes to keep things quiet  and simple.  When Chuck befriends Belinda (Shelley Long), a neighbor in his  apartment who just happens to be a prostitute, Bill gets wind of it and has  an idea.  Belinda and her friends are in a dangerous business, and they  could use some help and protection.  Nights at the morgue are slow, and  they have a limo at their disposal (Sure, it's a hearse, but slap a sign on  the door, and you're in business).  Bill convinces Chuck that they could  make a fortune as ""love brokers,"" working right out of the morgue.  And  soon Chuck's life will never be the same.  Keaton is absolutely  spectacular as Bill (""Call me `Billy Blaze'""), in whom he has created a  totally off-the-wall, quirky, uniquely nuanced and endearing character  you're never going to forget.  He pulls out all the stops and never quits,  playing perfectly off of Winkler's reserved and cautious-to-a-fault Chuck,  the perfect foil for Bill.  The timing between these two is right on the  mark, and Howard keeps the pace steady and the laughs coming.  Wisely, the  story avoids any moralizing or delving into the murky waters of the subject  matter; after all, this is a comedy, not ""Taxi Driver,"" and Howard never  lets it slip even close to leaving the laugh track.  He keeps it light and  funny and makes sure the characters are real people; there's no buffoonery  or slapstick here, and it keeps the real humor centered and at the heart of  the story.  Shelley Long, too, adds a nice touch with her spin on Belinda,  the hooker with the heart-of-gold.  The supporting cast includes Gina  Hecht (Charlotte), Pat Corley (Edward), Bobby Di Cicco (Leonard), Nita  Talbot (Vivian), Clint Howard (Jefferey) and Joe Spinell (Manetti); and  look closely for Kevin Costner as a frat boy in the party scene at the  morgue.  Howard gets high marks for making ""Night Shift"" a memorable  comedy, and for keeping the dynamic Keaton on track to deliver one of the  most singular performances of his career.  This is a movie with heart, and  most importantly, plenty of laughs.  You'll be glad you didn't let this one  pass you by.",N/A

I expected the sort of criticism I saw in a post about &quot;American Beauty,&quot; in which the writer said that people who couldn't appreciate that one would probably like dreck like &quot;Die Hard.&quot;  Well, &quot;Die Hard&quot; is the better film, because (1) it sets out to do something more admirable and (2) it achieves it.  It sets out to be not just an action thriller, but a generous and original one.  (&quot;American Beauty&quot; was anything but original, and now enough said about that.)  Look at all of the genuine humor laced throughout the dialogue.  Look at how so many scenes appear to have been written, then written again and again, as if the screenwriter said, &quot;OK, we've moved the plot along here; now, how can we make this moment even more complex and hair-raising?&quot;This is the one Hollywood action movie that has been truly well thought out.  Every seemingly inconsequential thing -- including McClane's fear of flying (&quot;fists with your toes&quot;) to Holly slamming his photo face-down on the credenza -- turns out to be crucial to the plot!  That was so impressive.And has there ever been an action twist as delicious as Gruber confronting McClane when the latter doesn't know who Gruber really is (or does he?).  The theater audiences almost giggled with delight and tension.  Not to mention the leap off the roof -- the pivotal moment by which all other Big Action Scenes need to be judged.  And right there is an example of the generous filmmakers giving us more than we might ordinarily expect -- moments after the leap, we get (1) the possibility of his being stuck dangling there, and (2) the absolutely sweat-inducing moments immediately following his solution to the dangling situation (I'm not giving too much away).  (My only complaint about the leap is that McClane would have been gripping that hose for dear life, not throwing his hands over his head.  That, and the fact that his double had longer hair that was slicked back.)The whole terrorists vs. common thieves element also adds to our pure enjoyment -- instead of being thrust into a contemporary plot, the sort of which we usually go to the movies to escape, we get a story as elemental as a Roy Rogers western.  So it's appropriate that McClane's signature expression should be -- well, I can't say here.See this one, but see it in widescreen: there's at least one moment -- in the lobby of the tower -- when the suspense in pan-and-scan is non-existent because you literally can't see that one of the protagonists is unknowingly walking within a few feet of one of the bad guys.",N/A
325978,"I read &quot;Of Mice and Men&quot; for my English GCSE course,and I still can't get my mind around how simple and perfect it is as abook. Gary Sinise's film is a truthful adaptation, with only some slight changes, and captures the mood of the book pretty well.  I have to say that the most moving scene for me is still the final one. It brings tears to my eyes, every time. The cinematography is beautiful, all green foliage and crisp golden wheat - the use of light is particularly effective in moments such as the pivotal barn scene, where the golden beams peering through the darkened slats of wood make the picture both shadowy and light at the same time ...  John Malkovich is excellent as the retarded Lennie - it is always difficult to accept watching a well-known and intelligent actor play a retard, but he manages to defeat the viewer's preconceptions, and he convincingly shows Lennie's childishness, his incomprehension. Gary Sinise is perfect as George: physically suited, subtle and deeply moving.  Hehe ... now for the inevitable nit-picking. The main problem - though not so much a problem as a bit too much of a good thing - is that the setting seems to have been evoked so caringly it is almost too lavish.  It threatens to make the workers' lifestyle seem too attractive, not more detached and monotonous as it appears in the book. The support cast, while good are maybe sometimes too obviously sympathetic - Curley's wife's mean streak has been played down, and Slim seems more ordinary, less detached and &quot;majestic&quot; than in the book.  These are minor flaws though. In fact, the film's structure is quite sparse, and does not fall into the trap that other adaptations can, of sprawling or simply relying on the book's clout and key scenes to see them through.

524568,"Despite various flaws, this film succeeds at creating a strong drama with two excellent performances by Tommy Lee Jones and Samuel L. Jackson.  It is an interesting premise in today's world where the lines between politics and warfare become ever fuzzier.  Is a commander justified to engage an enemy to protect his men if there is a high probability of killing innocents?  With increasing frequency, radical groups use human shields to capitalize on this Western dilemma.  This film brought some of these issues to the fore, and though sloppily done in parts, it was an entertaining treatment of the issue.Director William Friedkin (The French Connection) is no stranger to action flicks, and the action scenes were extraordinarily realistic.  The trial was also well done from a dramatic standpoint, but some glaring flaws went unexplained.  For instance, are we to believe that with all the firing that occurred from the ground, forensics experts couldn't find a single bullet hole with a ground-based trajectory?By far the best aspect of this film was the acting.  Tommy Lee Jones was outstanding as the shot-up marine who turned into a second rate lawyer to stay in the service.  Samuel L. Jackson continued to prove himself one of the better dramatic actors around with a stellar performance of the dedicated career officer thrown into an impossible situation and then fed to the wolves.  Guy Pearce also gave a fine performance as the prosecutor for the government, although he tried to hide his British accent by putting on a New York accent and it sounded phony.Though unoriginal (see &quot;A Few Good Men&quot;), this is a very watchable drama with some credibility problems, but the flaws were more than overcome by the great acting.  I rated it a 7/10.  It offers food for thought regarding the difficult demands we make on our military in the world of post cold war international diplomacy.",N/A

192252,"Well, I rented this movie expecting a horror show.  What I got was a movie  that was more intruiging than scary.  I wasn't scared at all, in fact, but  some of the deeper plot elements kept me watching until the end.I did  not like the fact that most of the shots of the grotesque Van Daans were so  brief you did not get much of a look at them, but from a scientific  person's point of view, it kept you wondering about how this could have  happened to a family.The only part that made me sick was Jon Strauss's  having to eat...that fetus that had been soaking in formaldehyde for 75  years.  *That* was going beyond the good--or bad--tastes of any horror  film.  Horror film cannibalism is one thing, but this was overstepping  bounds.On the other hand, the element that interested me most, and  dissapointed me because it wasn't really resolved that well, was Kathleen's  baby.  It's a Van Daan.  Was it a boy or a girl?  Born with the horribly  mutated gene's of it's father?  Would it have to come back to the abandoned  island one day if it displays the symptoms of Jon's blood disease?I wish  that factor had been addressed more, but if they ever make a sequal--and  this I doubt, it was a B-movie--I would hope it would be this child coming  back, whether for medical reasons or simply to explore his/her twisted  roots.Now *that* would make an interesting movie element.",N/A

442046,"This film  is loosely based on the classic Dickens novel.  Very loosely.Set in modern times, it moves from the Florida Gulf Coast to New York with certain key elements familiar to readers of the original story.  There's a young boy who encounters a convict played by Robert DiNiro as a Mafioso. There's an eccentric old lady, played by a Anne Bancroft who wears brightly colored designer clothes, smokes cigarettes and guzzles martinis. Gwyneth Paltrow plays the icy young lady with cool detachment.  And Ethan Hawke is cast as the young man, a bit too much of a hunk for the role which is written to have him become the darling of the art world.There's a lot of star power here, and some nudity, but not much else.  The script does not do justice to Dickens' intentions.  We've come to expect good cinematography these days and so I must say that the Florida gulf coast really did look good.  What is lacking, however, is the dark brooding atmosphere.In some respects this is a pleasant video although it moves too slowly and never grabbed my emotions.  Gwyneth Paltrow does look pretty.  And Robert DiNiro gives an excellent performance.  But in a world where we can make choices about our entertainment, there's a lot better out there.  And if Charles Dickens were alive today, I'm sure he would agree.",Great Expectations VHS

211713,"One of the greatest films of the eighties, &quot;An Officer and a Gentleman&quot; -- the tale of a raw recruit struggling to complete a  gruelling training program in an aviation academy -- combines impressive  performances from its stellar cast with a storyline exploring issues of  romance, friendship and the courage to survive. The relationship between  the recruit Zach Mayo (Richard Gere) and the tough gunnery seargeant Foley  (an unforgettable Louis Gosset Jr.) is the focus of the film. Foley warns  Mayo that he will be courting the local girls at his own risk, since some  may deliberately cause themselves to get pregnant in order to ensnare  budding aviators into marrying them. This theme is poignantly developed  when Mayo's best friend, played by David Keith, sacrifices his aviating  career for the sake of a girl who fakes her pregnancy to trap and deceive  him, leading to his tragic suicide. The dialogue between the two friends in  the mess room is one of the most absorbing scenses in the film. It makes a  significant point about individuality and responsibility. Mayo is the  clear-headed realist: he believes that one should always put his own  self-interest first and concern himself primarily with his own welfare, a  view which is opposed by his duty-bound and eventually love-crossed friend,  the kind-hearted loser whose morality gets the better of his sense. A very  uplifting film, with excellent support from Debra Winger as Mayo's love,  Paula. There is also an excellent musical score by Jack Nitzsche.",An Officer and A Gentleman VHS

523563,"You really get yor money's worth with &quot;Gladiator&quot;! This is a DVD lover's dream come true --- an epic movie loaded with tons of extras. First and foremost, this two-disc set features a beautiful widescreen print of one of the most visually stunning films in Hollywood's history. Director Ridley Scott and crew bring Ancient Rome to life in a grandiose fashion not seen since &quot;Ben Hur&quot;. The images are so crisp and 3-dimensional that it's hard to believe so much of this film is computer generated. The DTS sound really delivers. Crank it up during the intensely  thrilling Roman Coliseum battles. It's like being front-row and center as the heroic Maximus (Russell Crowe) slays both man and beast during some of the most riveting fight scenes ever filmed. Of course, all the visual effects in the world are worthless if the movie itself fails to deliver. No worry here. The tension between Maximus and Emperor Commodus (a wonderfully evil Joaquin Phoenix) carries &quot;Gladiator&quot; from beginning to bloody end. Phoenix is one of the creepiest bigscreen villains of all-time-- a snide, backstabing traitor. Crowe, however, is as heroic as Phoenix is evil. I guarantee you'll cheer Crowe's every move during their imminent showdown. It's a battle of pure bloody vengeance which, in terms of thrills, is unsurpassed.Just as satisfying as the film itself is the second disc which is packed with extras. Included are a &quot;making of&quot; mini-documentary, and a pair of &quot;behind the scenes&quot; featurettes which provide a lot of interesting insight. Director Scott provides an informative audio commentary which I found to be nearly as good as the movie itself. And if all this isn't enough, you get a ton of deleted scenes (complete with commentary) and a gallery of still photos from the set of &quot;Gladiator&quot;. Overall, this is a first-rate DVD. It's not often that a film of such epic proportions is packaged so well for the home theatre crowd. In fact, the extras alone are worth the price of admission. Highly recommended for action fans.

459035,"Image is releasing these original Twilight Zone episodes NOT in the order  of the original broadcast date (which I would've preferred), but rather in  a way so that each volume contains episodes that have roughly similar  themes.  The result is often that the best episodes, mostly the earlier  ones in the series' 5-season run, are scattered among different  volumes.Volume 7, however, is one of the better ones, since 3 of the 4  episodes selected are among the best in the series: &quot;The  Hitchhiker&quot;, &quot;Perchance to Dream&quot;, &quot;Shadow Play&quot;.  The weakest of the 4 in my opinion is &quot;King Nine will not Return&quot;  but many people like it and think it's one of the best also.  All 4  episodes are about hallucinations or dreams that doom the  protagonist.Picture and sound qualities are superb throughout.  The DVD  also include extra material such as episode descriptions, biographical  notes, and trivias.It is hard to find TV stations that show TZ episodes  these days, and even when they do, they sometimes don't show all the  episodes (especially the 1-hour ones), and episodes are almost always  edited for time.  The TZ episodes on these volumes are uncut and  uninterrupted; and for TZ fans they definitely worth collecting.Programs  like The Twilight Zone are a dead genre.  Today's viewers aren't likely to  watch a sci-fi show without expecting special effects and action scenes.

554469,"They are all here, some of the best Bonds of the series: ""From Russia With Love,"" ""You Only Live Twice,"" ""Diamonds Are Forever,"" ""Octopussy,"" ""A View To A Kill"" and ""The Living Daylights"" There are 3 James Bonds: Sean Connery, Roger Moore and Timothy Dalton. Not bad. John Barry scored all these, too!The print for ""From Russia With Love"" is grainy. ""You Only Live Twice,"" ""Diamonds Are Forever,"" ""Octopussy,"" ""A View To A Kill"" and ""The Living Daylights"" are all excellent. The deleted scenes from ""Diamonds Are Forever"" and ""The Living Daylights"" are very cool! The deleted scene from ""A View To A Kill"" is the best.""A View To A Kill"" is based on ""Goldfinger"" and John Gardner's ""Role of Honor"" this is one of Roger Moore's better James Bond movies. It is a big improvement over director Guy Hamilton's ""Goldfinger"" which tried to be humorous, but was not very successful in that department. Hamilton did finally succeed with his excellent ""Man with the Golden Gun."" It was a mixture of action and humor at its best.""A View To A Kill"" is the most luxurious looking Bond movie. Zorin's magnificent palace and stables are the type of boost that ""Goldfinger"" needed. Zorin, after Scaramanga, has got to be one of the best villains of the series. He's a real psycho. May Day, after Nick Nack, is the best henchman. She gives a real twisted 80's performance.The opening pre-title sequence is one of the best. Bond is being chased down an ice-covered slope by Russian troops in Siberia to an exciting John Barry score highlighted by the Beach Boys' ""California Girls"" while he escapes on a ski mobile runner turned ski board. This is an excellent scene full of action and laughs. The Beach Boys' ""California Girls"" was a stroke of genius. John Barry really knows how to score a Bond movie! The getaway in a mini sub disguised as an iceberg was another stroke of genius. I was on the edge of my seat. Those were better ski scenes than those filmed in ""The Spy Who Loved Me"" and ""The World Is Not Enough."" They were close, but not quite as good as those in ""On Her Majesty's Secret Service"" or ""The Living Daylights.""Duran Duran's opening main theme is the best of the series. It was even better than Lulu's ""Man with the Golden Gun."" Maurice Binder's main titles were his best since ""Man with the Golden Gun.""This film is just so great. Roger Moore looks younger in this one. I never saw him move better. I think these are the most stunts that he ever did in any Bond movie. The fight scene in Zorin's warehouse was one of his best. I like the way he lays out the guard on the conveyor belt and gets automatically wrapped like a corrugated carton. That was very cool.The steeplechase scene was also great and real suspenseful. I didn't know that Roger could ride a horse like that. When he breaks away into the woods that was really well filmed just like the similar scene in ""Moonraker."" Very cool, that's all I can say.The Eiffel Tower scene where Bond is chasing May Day through Paris in a stolen taxi, is one of the greatest scenes in the series. It was so funny. When Bond's taxi gets cut in half I thought he was done for. However, he keeps up with her and manages to crash a wedding on a moving barge. Crazy stuff! This kind of thing is what made the 80s so great!Q had some of his best scenes in this film. The microchip briefing in M's office was good and reminiscent of ""Moonraker"" and ""Octopussy."" I liked Q's surveillance machine. That was very innovative. It was also good to see Bond, Moneypenny and M all at the races. General Gogol had some good scenes too. I like when he puts the cassette in the player in his car and it starts playing the Japanese Spa music. That was really funny.The underwater scenes in this film were excellently filmed. I was holding my breath when Bond taps the tire of the sunken Rolls for air. That was very innovative. Zorin's San Francisco pumping station was also done well. When Bond was underwater I thought for sure he was going to get sucked in by those propeller blades.  That was filmed as good as any underwater scene from ""Thunderball,"" ""For Your Eyes Only."" ""Licence To Kill"" or ""Tomorrow Never Dies.""The sets in this movie were great. The interior of Zorin's airship was very reminiscent of ""Goldfinger"" and ""Diamonds Are Forever."" Zorin's mine was one of the best sets from the entire series. Caves are cool, just like in ""Live and Let Die"" and ""Dr. No."" Just like SPECTRE, Zorin eliminates undesirables just like they were terminated similarly in ""From Russia With Love"" and ""You Only Live Twice.""I liked the way they got the Russians involved in the plot. You can't have a good Bond movie without them. Not to worry, they show up again in ""The Living Daylights"" and ""GoldenEye.""Stacey was the best Bond girl since Mary Goodnight. You really feel for her. I almost thought Bond was going to leave her in the elevator shaft the way she was screaming. Bond saves her just in time. She was also great in the fire engine chase and the ultimate battle between Bond and Zorin on top of the Golden Gate Bridge.This film has it all: action, suspense, humor, laughs, terror, set designs, great underwater scenes and car chases. The only thing it lacked was exotic locales. That is what gives ""Man with the Golden Gun"" and ""Octopussy"" one up on ""A View To A Kill.""",James Bond 007 Collection Volume 3 VHS
574367,"There's been a lot of debating over whether or not this film deserves its Berlin Silver Bear award. In my mind it deserves more than that, for this  is truly a remarkable film.The Million Dollar Hotel is a home for  outcasts and mentally unstable people. Once it was probably a high-class  place, but time has taken its toll and it is now merely a parody of itself.  Inhabitants include a mad Indian Chief wannabe (played by Jimmy Smits), a  guy who thinks he's a member of the Beatles (hilariously played by Peter  Stormare) the retarded ""hero"" of the story Tom Tom (Jeremy Davies) and the  shadowy, silent Elouise (Milla Jovovich) who he has a serious crush on.  One day Tom Tom's nearest friend fall off the roof of the hotel, and foul  play is suspected. It is then up to an FBI Special Agent (Mel Gibson) to  find the murderer. This is no easy task indeed!What sets this movie  apart from the mainstream is that it oozes atmosphere and that is dares to  be *different*. Director Wim Wenders has taken the story by none other than  Bono from U2 and worked his magic on it. The result is a visually stunning  film with some of the most intense moments I've ever seen. Add the amazing  soundtrack, also by Bono, and the excellent performances by all actors and  the result should be obvious: an instant classic.Bear in mind, though,  that this is my opinion of the movie. It is shared by a couple of my  friends, but other reviewers have strongly criticised the film. I fail to  see why, but it just seems to be one of those movies that people either  love or hate. In any case I strongly recommend seeing it, if only to  experience its intense, sad beauty. This is indeed no cheerful film, but it  does have its fair share of funny quirky moments.The Million Dollar  Hotel is one of those rare movies that touch something deep inside me, and  leaves me speechless.

Charlie Brown goes to the mayor's office with a simple solution:  make Snoopy the Pied Piper.Promised a year's supply of dog food for his  services, Snoopy (armed with a concertina instead of a pipe) begins to  magically lure the mice out of town.

So Snoopy plays his concertina once  again, magically compelling the mayor and his council to dance out of town  to the tune of &quot;Snoopy, the Pied Piper.&quot;  All's well that ends  well.It's good to see the gang doing something a little different for  a change, but though I liked this story, I prefer original Peanuts tales  rather then faerytale retellings.As for this DVD release, there's some  good and bad.  The good is the bonus feature of a special 11 minute  retrospective interview with Peanuts creator Charles M. Schulz.

441102,"The FILM: After all those years, Sam Raimi's debut feature still delivers very well. This film did not only become a cult favourite because of its excessive use of gore, but because it was made by a bunch of very talented people. You want proof? Here you go: The special effects seem, especially to our nowadays CGI-spoiled eyes, very cheap, crude and primitive, yet the film still works extremely well. Even after all those years, the film still manages to conjure a very special atmosphere which greatly contributes to the success of this film.

The DVD: The picture quality is hardly striking but, considering the source material (it was, after all, an &quot;amateur&quot;-film), very pleasing.

501783,"This film is a remake of the 1962 horror classic of the same name.  The 1962 original was atmospheric, darkly poetic, haunting; its story a subtle balance between two alternate interpretations.This is none of those.  This remake is a clunky mess, arbitrarily meandering through pointless  scenes and aimless &quot;monsters&quot; lifted from JACOB'S LADDER.Aside from the monsters, a line, too, is lifted from JACOB'S LADDER.  The one about demons and angels.  This makes *some* sense, as both the  original CARNIVAL OF SOULS and JACOB'S LADDER are inspired by Bierce's  &quot;Occurance at Owl Creek Bridge.&quot;The 1962 film had a beginning,  a middle, and a twist ending.  This 1998 remake has numerous beginnings,  middles, and ends.  Scenes switch back and forth as the lead character  keeps &quot;waking up&quot; to indicate that all that went on before was a  dream.  If not for the rough road map provided by the original film, we'd  have an even murkier idea of what's going on.Basically, a woman drives  into the river, and at times seems to have escaped, at times is just now  escaping, at times appears never to have driven into the river at  all...Not clever, just confused and confusing.The original film's  cool lead actress portrayed a young woman afraid of life, who &quot;hadn't  really lived.&quot;  It was subtle, yet the point was made.

303314,"All in the Family is the best show of the 1970's, and possibly the greatest comedy show of all time. This tape highlights the funniest moments of the program, but to truly appreciate the genius of All in the Family,  entire episodes must be seen.  I personally have on video nearly every  episode of this wonderful show.  It is amazing that throughout a run of  almost an enitre decade, virtually every episode was thought-provoking,  shocking, heart-warming, and most of all, side-splittingly funny.  The  characters of Archie and Edith Bunker are permanently stamped on the  landscape of American television.  Archie, outrageously bigoted, was deep  down a caring and thoughtful man, who occasionally shows his ability to be  a man of intense compassion and love, especially for his loving and loyal  wife Edith.  Archie was capable of acts of incredible stupidity and  calousness, but when his family was in trouble, he always came through.  It  is a program that will never be replicated, and can simply never be topped.  It is a portrait of a narrow minded man and his innane, backwards beliefs,  but it managed to capture a nation of loyal fans.  Watching just a few  episodes of All in the Family (some of which are available from Amazon.com  on video in their entirety) only serves to emphasize how truly dull and  unimaginative American television has become.

251129,"I have longed to see this film for years, and I finally watched it Christmas Day! Spectacular!The movie was easy to follow with the subtitles and the closeups of the notes the Phantom was writing.A powerful performance by Lon Chaney, and the catacombs below the Paris Opera House were indeed spooky and helped to make the later half of the movie that much more suspenseful.I now have seen all movie versions of this. All of them were good, but not having seen many silent movies, this Phantom of the Opera truly captivated me. It is a shame that Chaney died before his time. I have read he only made one sound picture before his death in 1930. It would have been great had he made this role with sound. Truly haunting!I would like to see Universal do another remake of Phantom of the Opera using the same style makeup Chaney had and follow the story line closely without adding all the blood and gore of today's flicks.For the horror movie buff such as myself, the 1925 Phantom of the Opera is a wonderful addition to my collection!

423570,"This movie is an unsurpassed, old-fashioned adventure tale about friendship, and tragic, over-reaching ambition.  As an adventure, it far exceeds the wildly more popular but childish Indiana Jones series.This  movie follows the adventure of Daniel Dravot and Peachy Carnahan, two  rakish ne'er-do-wells in the British Army in India.  They leave the  service, and, alone, they pack guns and supplies and head north to  Kafiristan, a distant and mysterious land they've only heard tales about,  to become Kings, and plunder the kingdom.When they arrive, they pit  warring communities against each other.  During battle, Connery's character  is mistaken for a god when he is shot (in his leather bandolier), and  doesn't bleed.  As a result, he is made King. He is brought to the Holy  City, where the holy men mistake him for &quot;Son of Sekander,&quot; that  is, the Son of Alexander The Great.  They prostrate themselves before him,  and give him access to Alexander's treasure, which they have guarded for  centuries.Instead of taking the money and running, however, Connery  gets big-headed, gets to liking the role of King, and wants to stay and  administer his kingdom, which he does, and does well, it seems.As you  would expect, that's not the end of the story...but I don't want to give  any more away.This movie is also humorous.  It certainly isn't a comedy,  but the heroes joke with one another, and the humor arises from their  relationship, their fondness for one another, not from improbably comic  situations.This is a grand movie that treats grand themes, and it is  worth seeing over and over again.

Much of the action is on the desert. It is quite talkative. It is long. But with all this said, it still dazzles the eye and mind. The Blu-ray edition is an excellent package. Forget the criticisms that the filmmakers fiddled with history and that Peter O'Toole isn't physically suited to play the role. He is excellent, and the supporting cast, several of whom were Lean favorites over the course of his career (Alec Guinness, Jack Hawkins, Omar Sharif) show how the best actors can assume different roles without making the viewer feel he has seen the same character too many times.

Director Miyazaki's talents shine in this movie with beautiful animation and simple pleasures.  The  story is set in the late 1950's when a college professor moves to the  country with his two daughters who are approximately five and eight years  of age.  The family is happy for the most part, but their mother is  confined to a hospital for an illness not identified in the story.  The  girls are enchanted with their new home, an old spacious house situated in  the country, surrounded by farms and forests.  Unusual events begin to take  place with mysterious little creatures running around the house and strange  winds and noises outside the house at night.  Eventually the girls discover  Totoro, a large mythical creature who looks like a cross between a bear and  rabbit; he's big!  Mei, the youngest of the two girls, meets him first and  she's the one who names him ""Totoro."" Satsuki, the older sister,  meets Totoro later in the film while waiting for her father at a lonely  bus-stop during an evening rainstorm, which is probably the most enjoyable  scene in the movie.

I've never been to a Trekkie Convention or donned Spock ears but I'm versed enough in all the original series episodes to know that if you see kids in the first  scene, you'd better switch the channel. So, when the rave reviews for  GALAXY QUEST began to appear hailing the flick as a hilarious send-up of  STAR TREK, you know I just had to check it out. Well, I'm glad I did 'cause  this one's definitely a winner and a keeper!To begin with, the film's  writers are familiar enough with the STAR TREK universe to whip out some  well-aimed satirical phaser blasts. The thinly-veiled jabs at William  Shatner (the ham everyone loves to peck at)-- and his often rocky relations  with the rest of the STAR TREK cast (read their books)-- are witty and  on-target but not mean-spirited. Likewise, their take on the die-hard  Trekkies-- who have been mercilessly lampooned on everything from SATURDAY  NIGHT LIVE to THE SIMPSONS-- is hysterical without being nasty.

From the opening shots of Stephanie romping in the ocean with her family, it's a loser.  She is literally whispering the instructions in the warm up, kind of under her breath.  I wonder if they inadvertently released one of her warmup rehearsals because she is mostly talking to herself here--certainly not to motivate her audience.  The music has no discernible beat, but rather is a sort of 70's style sax and drum-riff background, which couldn't be more boring.  (If you watch carefully, she actually looks bored herself about 20 minutes into it.) She doesn't seem to understand the nature of working out to a video. If you mirror her pose to follow along, you will have to turn your head to see the screen, which of course is the wrong stance--she could at least have split the screen so you can see the proper stance, but mimic her straight on, eyes front.  With no beat to go by, it's difficult to follow along at her pace anyway, and you're best off getting the combination she wants down and using your own music!

44407,"From the creative mind of producer Darren Star (television's &quot;Melrose Place&quot;)comes this excellent, witty, and energetic series of four girlfriends living in New York City and exploring the topic that was once exclusively for men when it came to conversation, &quot;sex.&quot;  Based on the bestselling book by Candace Bushnell, &quot;Sex and the City&quot; revolves around the lives of four young, urban professional in search of the perfect relationship and orgasm.Sarah Jessica Parker (&quot;Honeymoon in Vegas&quot; ; &quot;LA Story&quot;) plays Carrie Bradshaw, a weekly columnist for a local paper, who writes a column regarding sex and relationships in the big city. Kim Catrall (&quot;Masquerade&quot;; &quot;Mannequin&quot;) is Samantha,  a big time publicist. Cynthia Nixon (&quot;The Out-of-Towners&quot;-1999 version) plays Miranda, a lawyer and Kristin Davis Plays Charlotte, an art gallery curator who is a bit prudish when it comes to sex.When these four Manhattanites get together, they do cause a commotion in whatever they do, and on this two-disc set, HBO Video treats viewers with the first twelve episodes of the popular new series where anything (and mostly everything) goes.The episodes which explore such topics as monogamy, threesomes, baby showers, and other topics that normal to the everyday denizen of a large metropolitan mecca such as New York contain the most wittiest scripts and scenarios that I have ever seen on television. Due to the lack of network censors, &quot;Sex and the City&quot; popularity thrives on its' ability to use profanity, sex, nudity, and other adult themes that are taboo on broadcast stations.The show also contains other delightful character that win will you over as a new fan. Chris Noth (television's &quot;Law &amp; Order&quot;) is always excellent in whatever role he takes, and as Carrie's love interest , &quot;Mr. Big&quot;, he will swoon you with his charm and elegance. And what would the average heterosexual girl living in the big city be without her gay best friend? In Carrie's case, her best gay friend, Stanford, is her very own Rupert Everett. His tales of dating in the gay scene, in addition to his flamboyance will cause you to both have pity and amusement for this funny sidekick.While this show will mainly appeal to urban women and gay men, it should be viewed and enjoyed by all. With all the recent network rip-offs airing on television already (e.g. UPN's &quot;Girlfriends&quot;), I can guarantee it would be worth your time and money to purchase this series and enjoy what can be called the most original television comedy in recent years at home.The DVD edition contains a great motion main menu powered by a flavorful salsa beat, and some of the special features on the set include DVD-Rom web links to related sites, a behind-the-scenes look at the making of the series, episode previews, language selection (English and Spanish tracks), and subtitles (English and French subtitles).I am anxiously awaiting the second season to be released on DVD.

However, it does  have some impact here, but it is used too straightfowardly (there is little  deception from the media) to be truly effective.The story revolves  around a group of preppy rich kids from Buenos Aires (yeah right) and the  journey from teenagedom to responsible citizens.

Excellent cast here with Harrison Ford in the title role, who gives the character the realism and depth needed to pull a challenging film like this off. Also in the cast is Tommy Lee Jones who is equally excellent as the ruthless cop on the trail of Ford and also Sela Ward, Joe Pantoliano and Julianne Moore.Keith Barish and Arnold Ropelson pull off this thriller triumphantly. Its a real winner! A classic masterpiece which earnt Tommy Lee Jones an oscar for Best Actor. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!!!!!",The Fugitive

6870,"Okay. Starship Troopers is a parody of a war film, about a quasi-facist future Earth in which people's lives are confetti, and duty to the state is everything. The point is nicely made, but just isn't enough for a fairly  long movie. Which is what causes the problems.Because after about half  an hour, Verhoeven suddenly realises, &quot;Drat, I'm stuck with this  now.&quot; And the film deteriorates into a pretty silly special-effects  showcase. Entertaining, but mindless. And the satirical point is at risk,  because when the film ends, you've forgotten how it began.Nice touches  include stunning SFX and clever casting, wherein gorgeous, ridiculously  handsome models get torn up by ugly bugs, thus parodying the action movie  type. But soon enough Starship Troopers has BECOME what it parodies. Shame,  because for a while it was really onto something.",N/A
482390,"At first, I thought that this movie would not be taut and original as the others.  When I watched it, I was surprised.  The movie contained all the elements of a good sequel.  It contained the traditional high body count,  suspense, and and black humor.The story is about Sidney Prescott,  who now goes by another name.  Her life is okay, but someone begins to  stalk her once again in a deadly game of cat and mouse.  Meanwhile, a movie  called Stab 3 is in production.  Before the movie is finished, a murderer  begins to stalk the ones involved in the movie one by one.  With each  victim, the killer leaves behind a clue.Gale Wethers, who is now a  major celebrity, teams with Dewwy to catch the cunning killer.  As they get  closer and closer to the truth, they realize that Sidney has a connection  to the carnage, and she may be the next victim.With a twist or turn  at every corner, the movie is guaranteed to leave you on the edge of your  seat.  It may have a high body count, but there is very little gore  involved in the deaths.  It is loaded with action and heart pounding chases  between predator and prey.  The cast gives a wonderful performance and the  script is well written.  Humor is placed in the right places and so is the  violence.  You would keep your eyes glued to the television screen until  the shocking climax.  I would recommend this to anyone who likes  suspenseful sequels.",Scream 3

Matthew Perry provides some excellent slapstick and does not come across as a Chandler clone at all.

Success has not spoiled Sayles.&quot;Limbo&quot; surprised and pleased  me at every turn.  All the characters, from bit parts to the principals,  are sensitively and accurately written.  Sayles never fails to get a little  scathing social commentary into the picture, and his throwaway dialogue  about the Disney-fication of Alaska is true enough to hurt.You could  call &quot;Limbo&quot; the antithesis of Lone Star.  In Lone Star, one  protagonist reassures the other at the end, &quot;Forget the Alamo,&quot;  meaning that we can cut free from our past and live for the present;  in  Limbo, all the characters are marked and haunted by their history,  especially Strathairn's leading man (a remarkably appealing bit of  acting).I was angry with Sayles, like many viewers, at the end [warning,  spoilers!] -- so much suspense has been painstakingly developed, and then,  agh, you never know whether these characters, about whom you have come to  care deeply, will survive.  However, I respect his decision to avoid a  cliche in either possible resolution.&quot;Limbo&quot; is quite simply  unforgettable, and a reminder that cinema doesn't have to be noisy and  stupid, or exclusively focussed on pretty young people, to be fine and  memorable.

The songs, the  music, and the singing are fantastic. Everything else is strung onto Elvis  like strings of popcorn around a Christmas tree.Not all Elvis films  are this good. What makes this one better are the glossy production values;  and the letterbox print definitely helps. Angela Lansbury puts in a highly  amusing performance as Elvis's ditzy Southern Belle mama (after all, Hawaii  is the southernmost state, no?). The whole story hinges around Elvis's  return from the military and his desire to return to his cozy beach bum  existence, while mater and pater want him to join the family pineapple  firm.The King, of course, is subject to no law. He goes into the tour  guide business, marshalling a well-preserved teacher and her four teenage  charges around the islands. His Franco-Hawaiian girlfriend is jealous that  there's more than tourism going on behind closed doors.At the end,  everything comes together.

Well, maybe Dellamorte (Rupert Everett) isn't illiterate, but  he's awfully close to it. He's only read two books. Okay, so he's only read  one, and it was a phone book, but that doesn't stop him from pontificating  whilst blowing away the living dead.There are lots of grody bits to keep  you entertained: buckets of fake blood, peeping tom ignis fatuus (okay,  flaming cotton balls suspended from obvious strings), and rotting boy  scouts. There are also plot twists which will bend your brain, like the  ever-present Dellamore. Dellamorte looks like a classic Boris Vallejo  model, and Dellamore looks like a hunky Boris Karloff. The dialogue is  hilarious, and the cinematography superb. Maybe the director resorted to  using fake flies in the death scenes (in retrospect, I'm sure this was  intentional), but he spared nothing in his camera work!

So, when my wife rented a copy of the 1999 remake of &quot;The Thomas Crown Affair,&quot; (the original being that 1968 classic heist film starring Steve McQueen and Faye Dunaway), I found myself predisposed to return it the video store unwatched. That, despite the fact that everything I had previously heard about the movie made it sound pretty good! Reluctantly, I decided to go ahead and sit through it...and am I ever glad I did!Thomas Crown, is a man who has it all. He's a smart, sophisticated Wall Street financier, worth multi-billions of dollars. He owns his own holding company, a New York skyscraper, and a gorgeous town house filled with art treasures. He has everything a man could ask for...except a challenge in life. He's bored. And he's always on the lookout for the ultimate thrill...In order to find that greatest of all thrills, he enlists a little help from a trio of Eastern European accomplices and pulls off a daring daytime theft of a priceless painting from a New York art museum.Enter Catherine Banning, an insurance investigator for &quot;a couple of guys from Zurich who don't want to just write a 100 million dollar check&quot; for the stolen painting. She's just as smart, sophisticated, and savvy as Crown, and equally eager for the next great challenge, the ultimate thrill. She immediately suspects that Crown is the mastermind behind the theft, and she will stop at nothing to get that painting back...including seducing her prime suspect. Soon, Crown and Banning find themselves collision course of sex, suspicion, ambition, jealousy, and betrayal......I won't give away any more of the plot. It is sufficient to say that the movie takes many a suspenseful and enjoyable twist and turn on its way to a surprisingly unpredictable outcome.Needless to say, I was very pleasantly surprised at the quality of &quot;The Thomas Crown Affair.&quot; In fact, I thought it was as good as the 1968 McQueen/Dunaway version. It is a taut, suspenseful film tinged with humor and wit The acting is good throughout. Renee Russo dominates the film with her splendid performance as the canny and sensual insurance investigator. Pierce Brosnan's portrayal of Thomas Crown is good, but certainly less intense and satisfying than Russo's characterization of Banning. The chemistry between Russo and Brosnan is enhanced by sharp, witty dialogue and the highly sensual scenes shared by these two attractive actors. However, their on-screen chemistry tended to suffer on a few occasions, when Brosnan seemed almost passive next to Russo. Denis Leary was excellent in his role as the highly intelligent and sensitive police detective Mike McCann, as was Faye Dunaway in her cameo appearance as Thomas Crown's therapist.At the end of a Friday evening of movie watching, with the ending credits of 1999's &quot;The Thomas Crown Affair&quot; beginning to roll, I had to admit: my wife had really picked out a very good movie this time!

It is not an action packed movie that would rumble your house with it's base and keep all the  neighbors on their toes. Rather this movie shows the suttle bond between a  brother and sister and it's growth through one of their daily hardships. I  should add that the director is in no hurry either to show this.  A movie  with some depth to it needs to be at a so called &quot;slow pace&quot;  inorder for the viewer to absorb and comprehend the ideas and thoughts that  are being introduced to them.If you like to watch a movie alone or  with a small crowd of patient viewers you will come out of this movie with  a big smile on your face and a happier heart :),The White Balloon VHS

The standard Vampyre-hunter van  Helsing has been left out this time and personally I didn't miss him. The  scene where Dracula is revived from his ashes with help of a little blood  is downright spectacular and Christopher Lee gives an excellent performance  as the not so dead count. Good camera work, a thrilling score and good  performances from the entire cast make this a fine contribution to the  horror scene.",N/A
546285,"I admit it, I watched JEM back in its heyday (or perhaps even a little afterward as my memories of it are the reruns on USA).  It was the glitz, glam and excess of the 80s wrapped up into a glamorous hot pink package that makes an army of Barbie dolls look mudane and typical in comparision.  Jem was like Rock Star Barbie, and the episodes for this series generally revolved around concerts, fashion, making music videos and hot sports cars, and of course the Vixen crossed with Taylor Dayne, dance inducing electric edged pop rock music that went along with it.She-Ra provided little girls of the 80s with a strong female heroine to look up to for their fantasy otherworldly fix, while JEM provided the &quot;I wanna be a rock star&quot; fantasy rolled up into made for tv animation.  It wasn't brilliance but it was definitely a nice fix for weekday afternoons.  Want to relive the nostalgia? Well here you go.",N/A
478547,"&quot;Being John Malkovich&quot; is a revelation.  Of course this movie  isn't loved by all; but such gems that jumpstart a new wave of creativity  rarely reach universal popularity.  The first thing I thought of when I  heard about this movie was &quot;Anything this off the wall has to be  good.&quot;  The second thing I thought was &quot;Hey!  I didn't know we  could do that.&quot;  I mean, what a startling idea.  This movie really  pioneers a new genre: I call it &quot;reali-fantasy.&quot;  People  steer away from this film because they find it too bizarre.  But the sad  truth is that the oddities in this film are just warped fun house mirrors  to our own lives.  Afterall, the only happy, sucessful character in this  film is Maxine; a cold, calculating, me-first-screw-everybody-else type.  The honest people just striving for their dreams are miserable.  Craig  wants to be a successful puppetteer.  Lottie simply wants to be a mother.  It is apparent that they will not be reaching these goals at the outset of  the film.Doesn't that just ring a little too true?How do they distract themselves?  Why, by becoming John Malkovich.  This  says another thing about our society; to distract ourselves from our  miserable lives we focus on celebrities.  We use them up, and when we are  done with them, leave them on the side of the road.This film is at  one moment utterly hilarious and all too depressing the next.  It truly is  a rollercoaster.  But with a story this enthralling, it is a ride you are  more than willing to take.John Malkovich delivers the greatest  performance of his career.  He doesn't only play John Malkovich, he also  plays the other characters that enter his mind so believably that you have  no problem believing that Craig Schwarftz is really controlling.John Cusack seems top be the only performer who didn't get any publicity  for this film.  That is really sad because his performance is so sublime  and strong.  After all, he is the sun of this film's universe.  If he  weren't as bright as he is the others would fall into despair apart.&quot;Being John Malkovich&quot; is a new film for the new millenium.  It  is perfect frame by frame.  I reccomend this film for everyone.  At least  try it.  You might like it, you might not, but you'll have to admit that  you've never seen anything like this before.  If only every film could be  such an innovation.",N/A
41495,"Don Siegel at his best was a creative and brilliant director capable of turning out tense, gripping and intelligent entertainment...and &quot;Invasion of the Body Snatchers&quot; is Siegel in his finest form !!Kevin McCarthy, in arguably his best performance, is sensational as small town doctor, Miles Bennell who returns from a trip to find the residents of Santa Mira strangely afflicted by an unusual malady that makes them believe that their loved ones are....strange imposters...lacking in emotion, warmth and soul. But is it really an unidentified illness sweeping the town, or something far more sinister ?? The evidence points towards a strange alien life form infiltrating their small community and Siegel mounts the terror step by terrifying step. Before long, Miles and his girlfriend Becky Driscoll (Dana Wynter) find themselves in the minority as the frightening epidemic of &quot;body snatching&quot; sweeps through Santa Mira like a brush fire, turning loved friends into souless adversaries. Much has been written about the McCarthy-ism aspects of this movie, so I won't dwell on that point, other than to say that &quot;Invasion&quot; escalates paranoia to a crescendo !With a spine tingling musical score, brilliant cinematography (especially the creative use of lighting) and a talented cast  that work in wonderful synergy together, &quot;Invasion&quot; still remains a benchmark in how to make a chilling science-fiction film.This much awaited DVD widescreen release even includes an interview with star, Kevin McCarthy and original theatrical trailers as an added bonus !An important, absorbing and influential film that remains one of the key release's of the decade of the 1950's !",N/A

Now that I've gotten older, I can appreciate the more obscure jokes, and  that's really at the heart of this movie, and others made by the  Abrahams/Zucker team: although &quot;Top Secret&quot; appears low-brow on  the surface, the humor really depends on the viewer being at least  moderately educated.

It  took me several hours to even speak- literally even speak- after seeing it  with friends of mine who bawled uncontrollably throught 90% of this epic.  It was days before I could even tell people that I saw it.I have seen  CITIZEN KANE; I have seen CASABLANCA; I have seen E.T.; ALL ABOUT EVE; THE  GODFATHER; APOCAPSYE NOW; Olivier's OTHELLO; IT'S A WONDERFUL LIFE; and so  on, and so on... this is the greatest movie I have ever seen; bar none.  I  never knew the love a father has for his wife and son could be portrayed so  incredibly, in the context of prevailing against the ultimate evil and  madness.  It's European way of refusing to tell you how to feel, but  allowing you to witness the uncontrollable flood of your own emotions as  you bare witness to that which is most frightening and most beautiful in  being human just has to be seen to be understood- there are no superlatives  I can think of that could do it justice.This movie has changed me,  and changed the way I see the entire art form of cinema- its value to  society, and the possibility of its capacity to reveal truth.I have  not seen the dubbed version, and I would suggest to any who have not seen  this in the theatres to find the version with English subtitles.  Dubbbed  films, in sacrificing so much in the translation, tend to muffle the soul  of the actors' perfomance; to big a price to pay, I believe, for the  convenience of not having to look down and read while looking up and  experiencing this in its purest, most complete sense.As far as I am  concerned, this is the greatest movie ever made.",Life Is Beautiful La Vita E Bella  VHS
89384,"Neil Jordan's Michael Collins is a fast paced intelligent work about a  early twentieth century Irish poltical activist and military leader. The  film has romance, pace, action, wit and humour. Neil Jordan is probably one  of the best script writers in terms of quantity and quality of product now  working in world cinema. It's his intelligence and unique way of seeing a  situation I find is refreshing. Dressing up a future President of Ireland  of Ireland disguised as a whore is witty and fair comment on the corruption  in politics in Ireland at the moment. Taking up the story of Michael  Collins after a failed rebellion in Dubllin, Ireland, against British  Imperial rule at the time, 1916, Jordan quickly introduces the characters  of the film. Harry Boland, a Dub amusingly played by Aidan Quinn (Fans of  Quinn can see him also in the fine This is my Father which he made with his  brothers) Eamonn De Valera, a political intellectual leader of the  republican movement well caricatured by Alan Rickman, and Kitty Kiernan,  played by Julia Roberts in a performance which will steal your heart. A  fine supporting cast led by english actor Ian Hart gives this film top  quality drama. The performance of Liam Neeson in the role of Collins is one  of the best of his career so far with the flair of his Oscar Schindler  character and the strength of Collins Cork origins mixed with poignant  reflective moments, this is terrific natural playing.Basically the story  is of Collins out-witting the British administration and winning a  negotiated settlement. A lot of Collins' characteristics are picked up in  the movie. His cycling around Dublin under the very noses of the security  forces, his playing with De Valera's children and wrestling with whoever  was about as a bit of a joke. Unlike the revolutionary leaders who are said  to have copied Collins, like Mao Tse Tung and Ho Chi Minh etc., Collins was  more likely to say &quot;are you on for a pint ?&quot; than any guff about  the good of the movement. His tactical talent and strategic skills are  shown but his skill at managing the large amounts of intelligence  information isn't as well appreciated in the film. His realization that a  republic was better forged under steady transition, and more logically  needed to be worked out as to its practical meaning, was a foundation stone  of the current Irish state. Further his belief that a democratic decision,  a popular vote, was the crux of any situation and to be defended despite  any loyalties to the contrary. This latter point is made dramatically in  the film as Collins and Boland find themselves on opposite sides having  been pals. (For more information on Collins try Tim Pat Coogan's  &quot;Michael Collins&quot;, a better read is  &quot;De Valera&quot; by the  same author.)",N/A

Although the subject matter may not be the most uplifting or flattering to American history, the excellent writing and finely crafted performance duly compensate.  Daniel Day-Lewis, Joan Allen, and Winona Ryder are at the top of their game, commanding attention, pathos, pity, admiration, both for their characters and for their deeply-layered work.  However, the supporting cast does not falter, either.  Rob Campbell is genuinely affecting as compassionate Reverend Hale, while Paul Scofield infuriates and fascinates as the unbending judge who begins to question his own judgment as the movie nears its climax.Credit must also be given to the fabulous Arthur Miller, whose contribution to contemporary American drama is matched only by a few.  His screenplay is finely-tuned, clever, and evocative, and makes the same impact today as it did in the 1950's.  Nicholas Hytner's direction displays his mastery of the craft, and deserves recognition as well.But perhaps the greatest merit of the play is that despite the standout performances, excellent writing, and superior direction, the message of the story still shines through.",N/A

225869,"I hate to sound that pretentious about a Ridley Scott film but I'm afraid that I have to in this case. This picture is a surefire way to feel more cosy no mater where you're watching from. There are two ways to break this  film down, the first being as the primary entry in a trilogy. On that  level, 'Alien' knocks the stuffing out of 'Aliens' by a superior approach  ('Alien 3' has been kicked around enough so I won't add to its misery here  by rubbing in the iodine) to the subject. The first film relied  wholeheartedly on tricks found only in the horror school whereas the latter  snowballed into a multi-story car park of blood, bullets and bravado. To  say that 'Alien' moves too slowly is an idiosyncratic peeve....the movie  utilizes this build-up to its advantage (you relish the terror sequences  more once you've had the luxury of becoming a little bored) while  preserving a realism that James Cameron just couldn't capture in his more  soporific magnum opus. There's just no symbolism in 'Alien' to make it  something it's not: it's just a straightforward space thriller presented on  such a slow-moving vehicle that you can't appreciate what your going  through until you watch it for the second or third time. To be sure, there  is much borrowed from Fifties 'B' certificates, but that matter is so  minute that it doesn't even register when put on the scales opposite what  this pic has going for it. Good direction, state of the art SFX (the horror  element in 'Alien' kept parallels with 'Star Wars' from being drawn in the  same way that you're not allowed to compare the architecture of  Transylvania to that of Disneyland), the use of a nondescript cast (come  on, people - what had John Hurt actually done of note prior to this?) as  well as the aforementioned protraction of plot development make for one  killer movie. This is a film about hunting and a film about hiding with you  on the hiding side, the slow areas only serving to heighten the tension as  surely as if you were lost in a video game. Get it now and wonder how you  went for so long without it.",Alien VHS

60324,"Fletch is my personal favorite comedy and without a doubt, one of the funniest movies ever made.  Chevy Chase is perfectly cast as Irwin Fletcher, a wise cracking newspaper reporter working undercover on a beach to expose a drug running operation.  At the same time, he is mistaken for a junkie by  shady millionare Alan Stanwyk (Tim Matheson) who asks Fletch to murder him.  Fletch agrees but launches an investigation into finding out why this man wants to be killed.  This isn't lowbrow humor, it's quick witted and very fast.  Fletch requires a few viewings before one is able to grab all the jokes, but it's well worth it.  I've seen this movie about 30 times and each and every time I watch, it remains as funny as the first time I saw it.  If you've liked Chevy Chase in Caddyshack or National Lampoon's Vacation, than you'll love him here.  The dialogue is witty and extremely quotable.  Chase's Fletch often disguises himself as he investigates the two mysteries, his cheap disguises and alias' (Ted Nugent, Don Corleone, Dr. Rosenpenis) are hysterical, Chase is a master of deadpan wisecracks, this movie is a perfect showcase for his talent.Aside from the brilliance of Fletch as a comedy, Fletch functions perfectly as a well made mystery movie.  I disagree with one reviewer who praised the movie as a comedy but said it wasn't a very good movie.  Fletch is a very good movie and aside from Chevy Chase, there are many other reasons for the success of this classic.  Screenwriter Andrew Bergman has written one of the trickiest scripts in Hollywood history, it manages to be flat out hilarious, and captivating in the same light.  Whenever I watch this film with a new viewer, they are always surprised as to how much the storyline grabbed them.  Another plus with this movie is Harold Faltermeyer's superb synthesizer score. It's similar to his earlier Beverly Hills Cop score, maybe even better, it helps set the tone of this movie perfectly.  Last but not least, we have the direction, all under the sure hand of Michael Ritchie.  He keeps things moving and maintains a comedic tone which occasionally borders on seriousness to help the story progress. Balancing tones isn't easy, in this film it's done so well, it's hardly even noticable.Fletch is all around, an excellent film, but before everything else, it's a VERY funny film.  A true cult classic.  For audiences whom have seen Beverly Hills Cop, think along those lines, I always thought it would be amusing to see what would happen if Chase's Fletch met with Eddie Murphy's Axel Foley of the Cop films.  If you've seen those than you have a good idea of what to expect with Fletch, a film loaded with belly laughs as long as you're willing to pick up on them.",N/A

Posey's brother brings home his fiance, played by Tori Spelling, to meet his mother and twin sister, played by Posey. He has not been home for years, and his mother nurtures the unnatural, sexual relationship between brother and sister. Posey instantly dislikes Tori so much that she goes out of her way to berate, insult, and undermine her at every turn without her brother interceding  and all against the background of a dark, stormy night (a cliched movie theme).

507264,"Note: this review refers to the 14-DVD boxed set and not just to Volume 1.No film buff and certainly no film major should be without the boxed set of 14 DVDs that Laserlight has issued under the umbrella title of &lt;The Alfred Hitchcock Collection&gt;. The DVDs are organized in no particular order, some containing only one film, some two, while two of them have a full film and an episode from the old &quot;Alfred Hitchcock Presents&quot; TV series of the 1950s. They all have a trailer of more recent Hitchcock films and they all have an embarrassingly bad introduction by Tony Curtis, whose connection with these films and with English enunciation is vague at best.The gems of the collection are &quot;The Man Who Knew Too Much&quot; (1934), &quot;The 39 Steps&quot; (1935) and &quot;The Lady Vanishes&quot; (1939). Of the earlier talkies, &quot;Young and Innocent&quot; has the quintessential plot of an innocent man and a girl who somehow winds up with him being chased by the police. &quot;Rich and Strange&quot; (1932) is not a thriller but has a shivery sequence as a couple on a sinking boat sees the water seeping into their cabin--just before it stops sinking.&quot;Jamaica Inn&quot; (1939) has an over the top performance by Charles Laughton (whose dialogue is hard to follow even on this restored version) and the first appearance of Maureen O'Hara. And for once, Robert Newton plays the Good Guy. &quot;Sabotage&quot; (1936) is based on a Joseph Conrad tale and has the famous scene of the boy on a bus with a bomb on his lap. (Later, Hitchcock commented he should not have let it go off.) &quot;Secret Agent&quot; (1936) gives us a young John Gielgud as a spy who kills the wrong man, Peter Lorre in a very bizarre role (helped or hindered by his drug-taking on and off the set), and the suavest villain of them all--Robert Young!&quot;Number 17&quot; (1932) is one of the films Hitchcock did not want to film, and he gave us a great spoof on the genre of the spooky houses, diamond smugglers, and derring-do. &quot;Murder&quot; (1930) boasts a super cool Herbert Marshall as a jurist who reluctantly says guilty at a woman's murder trial and then spends the rest of the film proving her innocent.More fascinating is &quot;Blackmail&quot; (1929), which existed in silent and talking versions. We have the latter and the often commented upon scene in which Hitchcock plays with the soundtrack so that only the word &quot;knife&quot; can be heard during the last part of a long monologue. Another trick he was forced into was the use of a British actress reading out the lines of the foreign-born heroine.&quot;The Skin Game&quot; (1931) is weakest of the talkies included in this set; and indeed the dialogue is almost impossible to understand.Of the silents, &quot;The Lodger&quot; (1927) is in the worst shape but it shows very clearly the influence of the silent German film on Hitchcock's early (and later) technique. Of course the long takes of a face staring into the camera are laughable today; but this is an historical document and demands a certain degree of detachment. &quot;The Ring&quot; (1927) does strain credibility, while it shows Hitchcock's love for show business of any sort, even circus freakshows and boxing.&quot;The Manxman&quot; (1929) is slow and predictable with its love triangle, a misreported death, and the return of the husband. &quot;Easy Virtue&quot; (1927) is based on a Noel Coward play, which it follows only half way through the film, and shows a sympathetic view of the &quot;woman with a past&quot;--in this case, a divorce--together with a condemnation of those who cannot accept her. More Social Studies than good drama here.However, &quot;The Farmer's Wife&quot; (1928) is quite funny once the somewhat jerky widower offers himself to three unlikely women while his housekeeper loves him in silence and has to assist him in his wooing spree.One feature of these DVDs you will probably not need is the ability to hear the talkies in English, Spanish, Chinese or Japanese; or to subtitle the dialogue cards in the silents in the last three languages.A strange feature of these DVDs is that they immediately take you into the film rather than into the menu. This should be changed in future printings.So all in all, I would guess you would want to see some of the talkies many, many times, some of the silents less often, and some of them never again. But once more, this is a very valuable set for students and just plain lovers of film history, especially the part played in that history by Hitchcock.",Alfred Hitchcock - The Collection: (The 39 Steps / Jamaica Inn / Young and Innocent / The Manxman / The Secret Agent / and more)
332517,"Stanley Kubrick's visionary masterpiece remains fascinating and compelling even today.  Though as one reviewer stated the plot and symbolism are purposely subtle, this only compounds my interest in the film.  I love the  fact that it creates a feeling, a mood and a universe of possibilities way,  way before its time -- every detail is surprising, and you best take  nothing for granted.  As a child, the monoliths terrified me -- today,  those big black sheets of metal remain ominous but also astound me and  leave me in awe.  I think this Kubrick's best movie, because it envisioned  a world that had never existed before.  The opening sequence with the dawn  of man still confounds me -- how many of them were real apes, because that  is the best darn ape makeup I have ever seen.  And the use of classical  music throughout was a stroke of brilliance -- the images match the music  beat for beat, not just in terms of choreography, but in terms of their  visionary quality, timeless and sublime.",N/A

It has fantastic costume designs, great special fx for it's time, superb performance from the entire cast and a rocking soundtrack by Toto. But i still feel the DVD deserves better. The running time was many times shorter than the theatrical release. There was even a three hour plus DVD version of the movie available only in the U.K. For most part, the U.K release(Extended TV Edition)was better although it was toned down a bit but it improves a lot in the drama, plot and characters' development. Hopefully, Universal will bring the extended version to U.S shores or at least a director's cut of the film. In the audio/visual departments, this is still the best version without any sign of grain but picture tends to be soft at certain areas(the special fx areas)due to the age of the film.

But heck...in the movie they turn the lights off first, so nobody could see anything...well at least that's what they think!!  In one of my personal favorite movies, Joan plays rich deb Bonnie Jordan, who after the loss of her family's fortune, must go to work like everyone else.  While Bonnie becomes a cub reporter on the local newspaper, her brother Rodney becomes a bootlegger to an ultra rotten  mobster, played by the one and only Clark Gable.  Bonnie's assignment to discover who murdered the newspaper's leading reporter leads her to a shocking discovery.Things to take note of:  1)Joan uses a metallic blow drier on board the yacht that looks almost exactly like the blow driers we use today!  2)Attitudes towards cigarettes sure have changed!

398951,"One of the best of Fritz Lang's American movies - a thriller with the logic and plausibility of a nightmare.  Lang's technique is so sure and so seductive that the viewer completely identifies with the safe, serene protagonist (Edward G. Robinson), an associate professor of psychology in a New York City college, and shares his shock and fear when he's caught in a trap.  The professor is interested in the relation of motive to homicide - an interest that's purely a matter of intellectual curiosity.  Then, when his wife and child are out of town, he visits a woman's apartment; her lover comes in and unexpectedly attacts him, and he kills the intruder with a pair of scissors..............

125185,"Of the three Tom Clancy novels made into films, &quot;Patriot Games&quot; disappoints the most. Based on one of the least of Clancy's novels, the film is about Ex-CIA analyst / Ex-Marine Jack Ryan, who interferes with an  Irish terrorist attack on a member of the Royal family at the beginning of  the film and quickly becomes a target himself- matching wits with the  radical group as they plot another hit, this time on Ryan's family.  Harrison Ford (Ryan) seems to be still feeling his way through the role  Alec Baldwin almost certainly regrets abandoning after 1990's &quot;Hunt  for Red October&quot;. I liked Sean Bean's performance as the terrorist  obsessed with evening up the score with Jack Ryan, but few others stand out  (unlike &quot;Red October&quot;). The plot fails to move much- Ryan is too  busy reacting to events.Clancy fans will enjoy. Dunno about everyone  else.",N/A

See it knowing as little aspossible, I saw this film totally cold and really enjoyed it and wastotally surprised. I think it's easily the best film I've seen in thelast ten years.....The casting andacting is exceptional. The highlight of the film is the line-up scenewhich is really funny (the director filmed the scene a number of timesand chose the best take) but the film as a whole is of a very highstandard and will keep you guessing until the end.....Kevin Spacey is brilliant and did win an Academy Award for hisrole but everyone else is just as exceptional. Particular attentionshould be paid to Stephen Baldwin who finally found a role and a moviethat can really demonstrate that his talent. As the hyperactiveMcManus who knows no fear and has some of the best dialogue in thefilm to boot.There isn't a weak link in the film and the 5 actorswho are &quot;the usual suspects&quot; convey exceptionally a groupwho find themselves trapped into a job that is seemingly unachievablebut come agonisingly close to carrying out the impossible.

477199,"What surprised me most about THE 4D MAN was the script. The characters are very well-defined, strong, logical, consistent and nicely developed, and the performers play the parts admirably. Above-average characterization is  not usually something you'll find in a minor sci-fi thriller! Director  Irvin S Yeaworth Jr is better known for THE BLOB, a movie that also boasts  an above-average character in Steve Andrews (Steve McQueen). Perhaps not  surprisingly, both films were co-written by Theodore Simonson (his only  film credits). It's almost a shame Simonson didn't do more film work.THE  PLOT: Tony Nelson (James Congdon), the younger brother of research  scientist Scott Nelson (Robert Lansing), is attempting to duplicate a lab  accident in which he passed a pencil through a thick plate of steel. The  brothers eventually team up but it transpires that the original accident  was caused mainly by the influence of abnormally high brainwave activity.  Scott's coincidental suffering of headaches induced by powerful brainwave  impulses triggers another accident in which his hand passes through a solid  plate of a newly-invented impenetrable metal. Soon Scott can pass through  anything just by exercising his willpower, but the ability comes with a  price. He grows older with each effort, and can only rejuvenate himself by  stealing the life from others. Soon people are found dead of extreme old  age...even if they were young. It's up to Tony and their mutual girlfriend  Linda Davis (Lee Meriwether) to stop Scott who is slowly going mad.The  effects are decent for their time. I remember FAMOUS MONSTERS OF FILMLAND  magazine had a contest (or maybe the studio sponsored it) challenging  people to duplicate the abilities of the 4D MAN! The acting is good, as I  mentioned, but Robert Lansing in the lead role is terrific, his performance  is wonderful to watch. It's worth viewing the film just to see Lansing, he  really is incredible.For some reason (maybe seeing stills in FAMOUS  MONSTERS) I always envisioned this movie was in black and white, but it is  in color. The DVD's image quality is very good, perhaps a little grainy but  probably normal for its age (the film was released in 1959). There are no  extras on the disc; the main menu is the scene selection. The sound is  fine, but that brings me to the most unfortunate aspect of the movie - the  music. Completely inappropriate, the loud, brash jazzy music is remarkably  distracting and thoroughly annoying. I couldn't help thinking how much  better the movie would be with a score by someone like Bernard Herrmann or  Dimitri Tiomkin instead of Ralph Carmichael!Add this up: a believable  story, outstanding acting from the lead, above-average characterization,  okay special effects, better makeup effects and terribly inappropriate  music. The sum is a high recommendation for THE 4D MAN.",N/A

549856,"Is he cheating on her, or isn't he? Hope Davis (Mumford, Next Stop Wonderland) plays a young wife who inadvertantly discovers a letter in her husband Stanley Tucci's jacket pocket.  The letter implies the husband may  have a love interest outside his marriage.  Ms. Davis inadvertantly informs  a family member who lets the cat out of the bag to other family members and  soon the whole family is involved and a judgement is reached that they will  pile into the family car and drive to New York City for the day on the off  chance they can &quot;catch him in the act&quot; of being unfaithful.The  action in this film consists of two conversations. The first conversation  involves the decision to drive to New York for the day, the second takes  place in the car on the trip into the city and afterward in New York.  I  wondered if the story wasn't originally a play, since it was heavy on (very  good) dialogue and the scene changes were limited.I knew only two of  the actors when I saw the film in the theatre--Ann Meara, who plays the mom  and  is a wonderful, overbearing, interfering mother looking after her  chick.  I believe in &quot;real life&quot; she is Ben Stiller's mom  (Something About Mary) and Jerry Stiller's wife (King of Hearts on TV). Ann  and Jerry were a comedy team on the TV variety shows in the 1970's--and,  Campbell Scott (George C. Scott's son). Campbell Scott is such a good  actor--and such a sleazy guy in this film you love to hate him.Like  other productions involving the talents of Stanly Tucci and Campbell Scott:  &quot;Big Night&quot;, &quot;The Imposters&quot;, and &quot;The Spanish  Prisoner&quot;, the film is low budget (sparse settings)+ wonderfully witty  dialogue + stylish actors and is supremely well done.

The reason I think of Allen when watching Brooks's work is because I  can't really think of another comedic film maker who is as witty. Brooks's  comedy is very verbal. And this movie has it's share of great one liners.  For instance in the very first scene we see Cybill Shepherd(Who is one of  many to make a cameo)presenting Brooks with a humanitarian of the year  award.

374830,"The Alamo: Thirteen Days to Glory is a significantly better representation of the historic battle than its better known namesake.  The production values are quite good, considering that a substantial amount of the  fighting during the siege, including the climactic final attack, were at  night, a fact accurately depicted in this film.There is still a good  deal of cliched heroism of dubious accuracy, and the acting is little more  than mediocre, but the producers and the director allow the event to be the  star of the show, minimizing the effect of these shortcomings.Somewhat  understated in tone and a bit slow to develop, the movie's seeming early  weakness becomes its greatest strength as the events slowly build to their  finale.  The final battle is brilliantly filmed, using a variety of camera  angles, quick cut-aways, and the blinding flashes of gunfire in the  pre-dawn darkness to give the viewer a sense of the confusion and terror  the befell the defenders during the terrifying attack.Thirteen Days to  Glory may not be Academy Award material, but it is a very noteworthy  attempt to accurately portray the events at the Alamo as they actually  happened.

38577,"First off, let me start by saying that this movie has one of the worst endings I have seen in a really long time, nothing is resolved.  Giovanni Ribisi has a ton of talent but it is wasted on this convoluted script which  has no direction and takes the viewer nowhere.  Ben Affleck is great as the  company's pitchman but his appearances are few and far between, as are Vin  Diesel's.  Nia Long's part is completely wasted and has no bearing on the  plot whatsoever.  The relationship between Ribisi and his father is  ridiculous.  So basically the only thing that makes this movie good is  watching these sharks in action.  The movie contains some great one-liners  and the action on the floor is key.  But overall, the narration is taken  right from Goodfellas 101 as is the camera work on some of the more violent  scenes.  I mean seriously any movie whose key quote was penned by the  Notorious BIG is trying really hard not to be taken seriously.",N/A

When the  film shifts focus to the adult Superman it falls into ridiculous slapstick  and destroys what could have been a fine example of classic film Americana.

522517,"The opening sequence of the movie sets the tone for the movie.  We are introduced to a buffed-up, shaggy-haired Tom Cruise climbing the vertical face of a rocky cliff in the middle of some barren landscape.  It is a beautiful, breath taking, death-defying ballet, but it is an entirely solo act.  The premise of the television series was that a group of skilled government operatives would be brought in based on their specialties and orchestrate a complex mission.  The first MI movie actually showed some of this spirit in the opening embassy sequence, but lost its steam as the complexity of the plot wore that movie out.MI:2 is basically all Tom Cruise all the time.  He drives, he fights, he dons disguise after disguise, he jumps, he kicks, he hides, and does all those things that action stars do.  Sure, there are a couple of support agents, but one is a glorified chauffeur, and the other just looks at a computer screen and looks worried.  The plot is standard action movie fare.  Bad guy, a former MI operative himself, wants to get his hands on a ultra-deadly toxin and its vaccine.  He plans to use it to demand billions from Australia, and the only one who can stop him is Mr. Cruise.  The key lies with a former lover of the villain.  A jewel thief, played by the beautiful Thandie Newton, she is recruited by Mr. Cruise, and they both promptly fall in love.  Much mayhem and destruction follow, as well as the predictable twists and turns, which climax in a mano-a-mano between hero and villain.The movie bears the hallmarks of the direction, noted Hong Kong action filmmaker John Woo.  There are the beautifully choreographed gun fights, the use of slow motion to enhance the drama and the mood of the characters, as well as the requisite doves flying in slow motion.  The special effects are par for the course, with plenty of explosions, bullets and locations that seemed to have been built for the sole purpose of being destroyed during gun fights.  One special effect that is particularly effective (until it is used for the upteenth time) is the removal of masks.  It is truly fantastic what a leap in technology we have from MI:1's mask removal sequence and MI:2's mask scenes.All in all, it is an average action movie that strays too far from the more cerebral Mission Impossible roots to land squarely in James Bond territory - there is even an M like character portrayed by Sir Anthony Hopkins.",N/A
516420,"Even though I knew the story after seeing the movie &quot;Boys Don't Cry&quot;, I am glad I saw this video. The facts of the case, especially the actual words that the sheriff used to interrogate Brandon after the  rape, were absolutely appalling and display the ignorance and prejudice of  the people in the small town of 5000, known for its dead-end jobs and  domestic violence.Now that I've seen both versions of this story, I must  say I preferred Boys Don't Cry with its scripted performance and planned  dramatic tension.  It also was able to portray some of the more intimate  moments with a sense of humor, such as the scene in which he gets a period  and steals tampax from a convenience store.  Scenes like this are  impossible in a documentary of course.The strength of the documentary,  however, was being able to see the real people, not actors.  And real  photographs of the troubled Brandon.  The realization that this is the  truth, not fiction, adds an extra punch or horror to that sickening feeling  I felt when I saw the dramatized version.If the story intrigues you, as  it did me as well as the filmmakers, make sure not to miss this penetrating  true look at this horrible crime.

Not only is this film hysterical, but it's message of  overnight love is also very uplifting. Jack Lemmon's tender and moving  performance as the sweet-hearted Howard Brubaker really tugged me.

277849,"A friend of mine forced me to watch this film... the premise sounded stupid and I HATE sappy, stupid movies.  I was totally floored.  This is one of the funniest family films I have ever seen. This is not a modern-day  slapstick no-brainer comedy, but a reminiscent look into the simpler 1940s  when kids sat in front of the radio all night and dreamed of being  cowboys.Ralphie's (Peter Billingsley)  fantasy is to hold the Daisy  Brand Red-Ryder BB rifle in his hot little hands Christmas morning and his  life begins revolving around this fantasy as the holiday approaches. He  practices using the rifle with his hands, writes a school essay about it  and pesters everyone from his parents to Santa Claus to make sure it's  delivered under the chimney no later than December 24.Don't be misled by  the director (famous for &quot;Porky's&quot;), this is a family film. There  is one expletive used, which quite frankly could have been snipped in my  opinion, but the overall feel of this film is one of innocence, adventure  and fond Christmas memories.  I watch this film every year and laugh myself  sick everytime I do.  Remembering the way we used to think and perceive  things as a child is what this movie is about, and how in many ways, much  of what we thought makes a lot more sense than how we think now.Darren  McGavin's performance provides some of the most hilarious laughs... he's  constantly shifting from being a grumpy old man to a little kid in his  emotional rollercoaster ride of mid-life crisis and fatherhood in the  1940s.I can't recommend this film enough. My only regret is the lack of  extras on the DVD. How about an interview w/ the cast, especially now that  the kids have grown? How about out-takes?

186651,"LAST YEAR AT MARIENBAD is unique in so many ways that it is difficult to  know where to start to describe it. Perhaps the most fruitful is to note  that it is certainly one of the most elegantly crafted films ever made. A  former editor, director Alain Resnais's work always has a peerless sense of  rhythm; his images seem to dance effortlessly across the screen. He is  helped considerably here by his cinematographer, Sacha Vierny (perhaps  better known now for his collaborations with Peter Greenaway), who bathes  the film in a soft, opalescent light. (The glacially smooth camera  movements anticipate the Steadicam by fifteen years.)Glowing in this  pearly light is designer Jacques Saulnier's vaguely disquieting and  ambivalently luxurious Rococo hotel. The film seamlessly combines locations  and sound stage sets into an all-embracing, chilly whole. The white walls,  gilded chinoiserie details and marble floors lend the film a candy-box  charm. Opening the box yields not sweet confections, however, but a nearly  claustrophobic totality, a fantasized projection entirely in keeping with  novelist Alain Robbe-Grillet's obsessive, repetitive writing. As the camera  glides down the immaculate hallways, it does not so much illustrate  Robbe-Grillet's text, or even build an environment in which it can be  recited, as create a visual equivalent to *listening to* a sinuously  rhythmed, incantatory, sentence like ""...le long de ces couloirs,-&agrave; travers  ces salons, ces galeries, dans cette construction d'un autre si&egrave;cle, cet  htel immense, luxueux, baroque,-lugubre, o&ugrave; des couloirs interminables,  succ&egrave;dent aux couloirs,...""I am not fluent in French, and I cannot  translate these lines. That is part of the point. You can enjoy MARIENBAD  without understanding the language. Indeed, it may be better if you do not,  since you are less likely to worry about what it ""means"" and to enjoy it  simply for its musical rhythm and texture. In fact, I strongly recommend  that you turn off the subtitles on your DVD and allow yourself to bask in  the film's rich aural tonalities.The filmmakers have no difficulty  involving us sensually, but they are indifferent to engrossing us  emotionally. While each of the principles is remarkably controlled, even  witty, their ""characterizations"" are flat and diagrammatic. The ""story"" of  MARIENBAD is our response to the film's unfolding. Sight, sound, texture,  voice and sensation are its real subject. For those willing to experience  it without prejudice, MARIENBAD is fantastically rewarding, ever-changing.  For those who insist on asking ""what does it mean?"" or ""did they or did  they not really meet last year?"" expect only confusion, frustration,  bafflement and disappointment.",N/A
245352,"On a drought-plagued farm somewhere in the southwest, spinster Lizzy Curry (Katharine Hepburn) has finally given up on ever being married, although her family wants to make one last effort with File (Wendell Corey), the local lawman.  Into their lives comes the fast talking con man Starbuck (Burt Lancaster), who promises that he can make it rain for $100.  More importantly, he can see the con job that Lizzy has played on herself and before he rides out of town he will have redeemed not only the shy spinster but himself.Katharine Hepburn was well into her period of playing spinsters by the time she made this 1956 film with Burt Lancaster. The idea of Hepburn and Lancaster making a film together is interesting since they had totally different approaches to the acting craft.  Hepburn would have the entire script memorized before shooting began whereas Lancaster preferred to learn his lines the night before. This is one of those films where the Bryn Mawr accent of the leading actress works against the character, but then the whole idea of Hepburn playing a rube--with costumes by Edith Head no less--is a bit of a stretch to start.  Lancaster really sinks his teeth into the role of the charming mountebank Starbuck.  Cameron Prud'Homme, Earl Hollliman and Lloyd Bridges play Lizzy's worried father and brothers, and it is they who really give the film its sense of life out on the farm more than the sets and scenery.Based on N. Richard Nash's play, the film was directed by Joseph Anthony, who had directed the stage version starring Geraldine Page (presumably an attempt to duplicate the success of Elia Kazan in moving from Broadway to Hollywood).  The story is still produced by community theaters as the musical &quot;110 in the Shade.&quot;  Hepburn received her seventh Oscar nomination for Best Actress for &quot;The Rainmaker&quot; (the winner that year was Ingrid Bergman for &quot;Anastasia&quot;), but the role of Lizzy Curry is not one of best performances.  Certainly Lizzy is becoming desperate, but Hepburn gives those scenes too much of an edge.  In her earlier films this worked quite well, most notably in &quot;Alice Adams,&quot; but in as a mature actress Hepburn was much more successful in underplaying the desperation of her spinster characters, as such did superbly the previous year in &quot;Summertime.&quot;  This may well be one of those regards in which it is simply difficult to separate the actress from the role.  However, in her strongest scenes she certainly brings dignity to the frightened spinster, and in the end you understand why she would actually pick Wendell Corey over Burt Lancaster.",The Rainmaker VHS

The Enterprise is studying violent geothermal activity on planets in the Selcundi Drema system.  While Wesley is put in charge of planetary mineral surveys, Data fiddles with the sensor array and comes across a radio transmission from a little girl on Drema IV named Sarjenka.

Suddenly this changes everything.What redeems this episode is the friendship between Data and Sarjenka, which is rather endearing.  For some reason I have always liked the way children interacted with Data, much the same way I get a kick out of Naomi Wildmon and Seven of Nine on Voyager.  No rationale explanation available, sorry.  In &quot;Pen Pals&quot; I am perfectly content to let Picard stew in his own juices as to how to save Sarjenka's planet without letting anybody who lives there have a clue as to what is happening, although I tend to think all those beings might turn to a theological rather than a scientific explanation that might alter their destinies a bit.

Though the casting was fairly good for that one, it was not as good as it could have been.  Plus the fact that it was a character that was hard to like.  There have been a few more in recent years also that though they were pretty to watch for the special effects, they were hard to watch for the lack of story.Picture my amazement when I heard that Bryan Singer would direct the film.

The  songs have a great diversity to them and that give them and very diverse  fan base and they never make the same song twice like other bands of their  nature. This album has a great mix of songs from the great opening track  Spice up you Life , to the 40's sound of Too Much and the Lady is a Vamp,  to the incredible Ballad,  Viva Forever. This is a great album, and I'm  sure the next one, Forever, will be just as good. I've already heard the  first single, Holler, holler and It's great.

163971,"Bram Stoker's Dracula? Hardly. More like MTV's Dracula where he walks around in London, wearing fashionable sunglasses. This is a Dracula where Victorian feeling in the book has been changed for stupid sex-remarks. And  a Dracula movie where the cast speaks english with an american accent  looses all credibility. Keanu Reeves is lousy and booring as Jonathan  Harker, Winona Ryder doesn't fit in at all. Only Anthony Hopkins is really  good as Doctor Van Helsing. Gary Oldman could have been good, it it wasn't  for ridiculous outfits.This movie is good for anyone that hasn't read  the books and doesn't have fond memories of the old Hammer-films with  Cristopher Lee. It has a good set (if you don't count Gary Oldmans Dracula  outfit), nice special effects and a good script. It just isn't  Dracula.See this a costly monstermovie and try to keep all the other  vampire-movies from your mind. Then you might enjoy this. As it is, it's  too much Hollywood for me.

63382,"I bought this title because Arnold Vosloo was a leading member of the cast, and I've come to appreciate his characterizations.  I'd not seen the original Darkman, so I had no preconceived notions of what the series was  like, I therefore enjoyed it more than a connoisseur of the genera might  have.  I did seen Darkman III first, however, and enjoyed it more; perhaps  because I enjoyed Jeff Fahey as a bad-guy more than I did Larry Drake.  They do say that the quality of the villain makes the film.  I also thought  Mr. Vosloo's Darkman was more brittle in II than in III.  Perhaps the  quality of the bad guy effected his performance too, or maybe he was just  getting used to his character and the series and was only  beginning to  develop his own particular point of view on both.  I tend to agree with the  reviewers who felt that the series would make a better subject for TV than  for Cinema.",N/A
362533,"This movie continues to be recommended to me over and over as friends see it in art houses, rentals and on cable.  In turn, I recommend to others.  This is a dramatic slice of life masquerading as a comedy.  It is  hilariously funny, but when the house lights went back up they exposed  light sobbing by some of my group.The plot is simple: gay Asian with  same sex mate decides to marry a woman needing a green card to fool his  &quot;old world&quot; visiting parents. Gayness is more a plot device than  an issue here.  It is easy to identify with these characters.  Though the  conflicts are comedic, they cannot be fully resolved.  It's a view of the  joys and frustrations of a loving family whose values are a big generation  apart.  The movie is partially subtitled and (I am not making this up)this  adds to the story because part of the humor is not everyone even  understands everyone else's language let alone lifestyles.

296569,"This film is considered by many to be the finest of the Johnny Weissmuller MGM Tarzan movies.  It's a crackling good adventure story that is a real roller coaster ride.  The African jungle, considering the B&amp;W  photography and primitive special effects, is vividly portrayed as a savage  place indeed.  Wild animals abound: charging rhinos, stampeding elephants,  lions with an attitude, and a tribe of fearsome great apes.  An annoyance  for Tarzan purists is the portrayal of Tarzan as a hulking brute that only  speaks in halting, broken sentences.  The character written of by Edgar  Rice Burroughs is an intelligent white ape that is fluent in several  languages, including native dialects and the animal &quot;language&quot; of  the great apes.  The Tarzan yell is overdone in this movie, too.  Depending  on the viewer's tolerance level, it may start to grate as chalk on a  chalkboard, especially when Jane (Maureen O'Sullivan) gets in the act with  her combination soprano Swiss yodel and the familiar &quot;ape call.&quot;  Again, ERB's Tarzan only gave this fierce victory cry as he stood bloodied  and dirty over a vanquished foe, animal or otherwise.  In personal combat,  Tarzan reverts to his primitive self and truly becomes a denizen of the  forest primeval.This film stresses the marriage relationship of Tarzan  and Jane more than subsequent entries in the Tarzan series.  The sex is  implied, of course, but one can easily infer that the jungle couple is not  celibate.  The costumes (especially Jane's) are very revealing for the time  period in which the movie was made.  There is a riveting &quot;nude&quot;  swimming scene that is a wonderful erotic interlude.  This segment had been  censored for years, but is included in the restored version. The plot  involves two wordly white men (including Jane's old friend) that show up to  entice Jane away from Tarzan, and to desecrate the elephant graveyard for  the valuable ivory.  Tarzan takes a dim view of these unfriendly  intentions.  Lurking in the brush there are fierce savages that stalk the  safari.  Just when things can't get any worse, the natives openly attack  the safari, kill the porters, murder the two white men stealing the ivory,  and, as Jane is about to be devoured by lions, well, you get the idea.  Before anyone dismisses this movie as a typically trite Tarzan movie, it's  fair to mention this was only the second film in the MGM series and it set  the pattern for much that followed.  The fast pace of the story, the almost  nonstop action, the sexual overtones, and the primitive setting all make  this an entertaining jungle adventure film.  Don't expect subtleties of  plot and character development, and you will be pleased.",N/A

481646,"This film displays a nice combination of dry, somewhat dark comedy and fun suspense.  Likely classified as a comedy, there are some good plot twists and turns that also make the film work as a good crime story, too.The  film centers around Charlie (Liam Neeson), a DEA agent who has had  one-too-many brushes with death.  He is burned out and ready to retire to a  seaside resort, but has to complete one last mission first.  A chance  encounter with a psychiatrist, and a resulting meeting with a lovely woman  (Sandra Bullock) who performs a very personal medical procedure that leads  to a date, change Charlie's life and outlook.  As Charlie makes his way to  the end of his mission, his story takes some interesting twists, and there  is a good deal of laugh-out-loud humor along the way.Although I have  always considered Neeson and Bullock overrated, both turn in solid  performances.  But, it is the supporting cast, headed by Oliver Platt, that  make this movie really tick.  Jose Zuniga, Michael DeLorenzo, Mitch  Pileggi, Colin Albertson and Mary McCormack round out a cast of familiar  faces whose name escape all but the hardcore movie buff.This is a good,  solid film.

302278,"A nurse's obsession for a womanizing-heel nearly ruins her life and the  lives of those around her. This dark, disturbing drama was the FATAL  ATTRACTION of the 1940's, and while Crawford doesn't boil any bunnies,  she's no less terrifying. In fact, I would venture to say that this is  Crawford's finest hour. Her character is on the screen for most of the  film's two hours, and she's believable and effective every moment. As much  as I loved her in MILDRED PIERCE, I must say that Crawford should have won  the Best Actress Oscar for this one. Crawford said in a later  interview:&quot;I worked harder on POSSESSED than any film I made&quot;,  and it shows. POSSESSED features the glamorous star's richest, most  powerful performance to date.

528174,"The opening scene for this movie really sets the stage for the myriad of beautiful cinematography that abounds throughout this movie.  Jennifer Lopez rides across a majestic desert atop a beautiful snow-white horse in a long and flowing white dress.  The sky is as blue as the rooftops in Santorini.  This is just the prelude for more.Jennifer Lopez stars as Catherine Deane, a highly esteemed child psychologist who is attempting to enter the mind of a comatose little boy in order to communicate with him and bring about his recovery. She's part of an experimental process that allows her to literally enter his dreams and interact with his subconscious through the use of a machine that sort of melds their minds together.At the same time, a serial killer is on the loose.  He takes his victims to an underground chamber, which automatically over a forty hour period tortures and then drowns his victims.  After abducting his last victim, the killer is captured by the FBI.  Unfortunately, however, he has suffered a rare form of schizophrenia which has placed him in a comatose state.  In order to infiltrate his mind in an effort to discover the whereabouts of his latest victim, Catherine is asked to go inside of his mind.The dream sequences that follow are stunning.  The costumes, the make-up, the settings are all awesome.  Some of the most memorable scenes for me are:The Horse - Catherine is following Carl (the serial killer), who is, in this sequence, just a little boy.  He runs into one room where a horse is standing in the middle of the room.  She tries to talk with him, but he runs into the corner and watches her from a distance.  She moves closer to the horse, rubbing him, and talking to Carl.  Carl, then, rushes towards her and pushes her out of the way.  At that moment, this clear box descends from the ceiling, cuts the horse into multiple pieces (which are captured within clear panels), and then separates.  Catherine walks among the panels, and you can clearly see the insides of the horse.  In one panel, you can still see the horse's beating heart.  It really is an incredible visual to see, almost like something you'd see in a science class.The Purple Robe - Catherine enters Carl's mind; and after a series of events, winds up on the floor in front of this &quot;demon&quot; on a throne at the top of the stairs.  This royal purple cloth is attached to his back, via hooks, and surrounds the gold room.  As he stands and starts walking down the stairs, the cloth begins to &quot;unfold&quot; itself around the room and trails the &quot;demon&quot; down the steps.  It is a stunning scene and reminds me of the &quot;Hellraiser&quot; series.Mother Mary - Catherine becomes a savior to Carl.  All I can say about this dream sequence is you have to see it for yourself.  It is stunning.I think this film is just incredible.

At the risk of sounding like a one of those stuffy, traditionalist Cambridge university lecturers it really  does spoil it for me when films based on historical events take ridiculous  liberties and forsake historical facts, which are more often than not  interesting in themselves to maintain interest, and replace them with  sensationalist and fictitious stuff.

But it is only annoying if it is meant to be  taken as a serious portrayal of the tragic and fascinating life of Anne  Boleyn, Great Henry's second wife and mother of the remarkable Elizabeth I,  and this film, judging by all accounts, is most certainly not.  The factual  content is a good enough excuse to get dressed up and go over the  top and the main leads Genevieve Bujold and Richard Burton give it their all as the fiesty two-some; the chemistry is striking and you can't help admiring the costume department for all those lavish items of clothing.Pap, but enjoyable pap and therefore redeemed.",N/A

The screenplay seems to  have been written in order to jump from one joke to the next, but with no  thought given to fleshing out each joke to give it depth and character like  a running gag can develop.

He first betrays the rebels after being  pressured by The Empire and in the end joins them to help save Han Solo in  &quot;Return of the Jedi&quot;. Not everyone is good or evil in this film.  Some have their own interests as Lando did in maintaining his mining colony  in Cloud City. The climax is great when we find out who Luke's father is at  the end. I won't spoil that if you haven't seen it because I've probably  spoiled a lot already. It is that moment that shocks the audience like no  other moment during the &quot;Star Wars Trilogy&quot;. It brings home what  the struggle between The Rebellion and The Empire is really about. From  beginning to end this is the &quot;Star Wars&quot; movie with the most  depth making it the best and shining star of the trilogy.",N/A
390847,"Glancing over the comments of some other reviewers here, one would think this was a &quot;pirate&quot; movie.  Well, yes, it is.  More importantly, however, it is a romance, a film that very likely helped inspire the  bodice-buster historicals that were so popular in the 1970's.  Romances are  fantasies and in such, it doesn't matter that the hero is prettier than he  should be or if George Sanders' beard looked strange.For the women  reading this, go rent this movie!  Lots of fun, fun, fun with titillating  scenes (tame for now) not usually allowed by the movie code.  Tyrone Power  as Captain Waring never looked so good and is shown shirtless, splattered  with wine, and stretched on a rack for your pleasure.The tepid romance  in Captain Blood with Errol Flynn is barely two stars compared with this  movie.",Black Swan VHS
65411,"My favorite film of all time is the 1999 version of &quot;The Mummy,&quot; and sinse long before that came out, I've known of Boris Karloff's 1932 creature feature.  But, I always figured it was another one of those  bandage wrapped, slow moving - and frankly very stupid &quot;mummy&quot;  movies. So I stayed away. Then, I saw the new version on the first day of  release (May 7th) and rushed out of the theater knowing I must see the old  version. Instead of renting it, I just bought it - and it was superb! The  basic story elements are the same in both versions, but instead of the  lavish desert settings, huge sets and breathtaking visual effects of the  Stephen Sommers version, director Karl Fruend's 30's film relies on mood  and atmousphere to chill you to the bone - which it does very well. Boris  Karloff plays Imhotep, whom in his native Egypt (3,700 years ago) was  buried alive for trying to raise his love Anck-Su-Namun (Zita Johann) from  the dead. Flash forward to 1932 were a british team of archeologists dig up  his remains and accidentaly revive him. Cleaning himself up, Imhotep prowls  around modern Cairo under the alias Ardath Bey, trying to find the  reincarnated soul of his past lover. He does so in Helen Grovesenor (also  Johann), but his plans might be in trouble as Helen's gurdian Muller  (Edward Van Sloan) and her boyfriend Frank Whemple (David Manners, both  from Universal's earlier horror film &quot;Dracula&quot;) will stop at  nothing to save her. As for power, Boris Karloff is a far cry from Arnold  Vosloo's running, fighting Imhotep in the '99 version - but is pretty good  with some supernatural Darth Vader like telepethy. This is surley one of  the most romantic horror films, as one in some way or another feels sorry  for Imhotep, as he looks longingly into the eyes of his mummified  girlfriend, but the film does manage to generate a few good scares, because  Imhotep is no softey, when you look in HIS eyes you'll see death and  destruction. And so while the 1999 &quot;Mummy&quot; is my favorite film,  the 1932 version proves that in Hollywood's golden age, filmmaker's really  knew what they were doing.",The Mummy VHS
100900,"Contact is a movie that works on every conceivable level.  It is a smart, thoughtful, and entertaining show with an absolutely brilliant performance by Jodie Foster (her closing scene testifying at a Senate hearing could be the best thing she has ever done, and that's saying a lot.)  What makes this movie so special is its ability to keep the focus on the characters and story despite the presence of some mindblowing, truly spectacular visual effects. That's unexpected with films today normally leaning one way or the other. (Speaking of visual effects, the camera perspective for the scene in which young Elle tries to help her stricken father is just impossible to explain or describe.) For the serious movie buff, the DVD includes some insightful commentary from the director and FX supervisors, as well as Foster. This is just a stunning piece of work that was overlooked to a great degree when it was released.",Contact
72074,"I was quite impressed with this film.  Namely with the fact Christian Bale conveys such a visciousness that if you were ever to encounter him in person you would never look at rich, wealthy, yuppie types the same way  again.  The thing that makes this film so much fun to watch is the fusion  of 80's nostalgia and raw carnage being displayed with such creativity.  I  imagine the forthcoming DVD will have deleted scenes that weren't used in  the initial film making the experience even more surreal.  What is so  impressive is how the director makes the mood so pasty and drab looking.  Every scene has this dark sensibility but most of the time you are  presented with daytime overcast skies, white walls and classic 80's  artwork. The sets make Batemans character seem so friendly but so  incredibly frightening too.  You leave the film thinking about all the  people you know in your life that could possibly have similar defects.  This film is definately a winner and sure to be the Christian Bale breakout  performance people will remember him for.",American Psycho VHS

With a movie, such as &quot;ravenous&quot;, I found it to be incredibly insane and stupid to base a movie on humans eating humans for supremacy and power. This movie is not based on humans eating humans for survivial, it is humans eating humans for the sheer pleasure of it.

66191,"I've always felt kind of ambivalent about The Birds.  Yeah, it's Hitchcock, and you get lots of cool Hitchcockian touches (the lack of a musical score makes the film much scarier than it otherwise would have been), but am I the only person who thinks there's way, way too much exposition and character development?  Every time I see it I find myself losing interest in the overdeveloped story until the brilliant restaurant scene, where everything is suddenly funny and entertaining and offbeat.  And that part when Tippi Hedren sllloooowwwwlllyyy walks up the stairs to investigate a suspicious noise and opens the bedroom door to find thousands of little feathered menaces... it's brilliant.  But you have to sit through so much gray, uninteresting, irrelevant character interaction to get to that point that the payoff almost isn't worth it.  Of course it's good to have deep, rounded characters in a movie like this instead of just a bunch of thick-skulled teenagers from Dawson's Creek, but this is overkill.  You could cut more than half an hour of dialogue scenes out of this movie without really hurting it.  But I seem to be in the minority on this one, so if you love this movie go ahead and get it.  You could certainly do a lot worse.",N/A

44910,"&quot;He who saves a single life saves the world entire.&quot;This was the Talmudic verse that Itzhak Stern, the bookishly serious accountant/friend/conscience of Oskar Schindler quoted to him in one of the movie's final scenes.On the face of it, Oskar Schindler was the most unlikely hero one is ever likely to hear about.  Lusty, earthy, and sensual, he was a reckless philanderer, a gambler, a member of the Nazi party and someone who saw the war as an opportunity to become wealthy.  But to the Jews who were fortunate enough to encounter him, he was quite literally their saviour.Spielberg succeeds with this film on two stupendous levels.  Firstly it is with the documentation of the humanisation and conscience of a man who originally saw the war as a personal opportunity and who, at the end of the 6 years, had gone bankrupt in his mission to save &quot;his&quot; Jews.  Secondly, and most disturbingly, it is with the graphic re-creation of some of the most horrific and barbaric acts ever committed by mankind, all in the name of prejudice and oppression.  Such is the reality of these scenes that viewers will feel outraged, afraid, paralysed, and oppressed.  Most of all, they will feel as if they too, had the supreme misfortune to be European Jews living under the dark cloud of prejudice and hatred that permeated the globe during the interminable period of the second world war.  And it will leave us asking the one answerable question - &quot;Why?&quot;Perhaps, as Oskar Schindler viewed these scenes firsthand, that is how he too felt.  An odd dichotomy in his character enabled him to fraternise with high ranking Nazi officials, especially the demonic Amon Goeth, while, unlike Goeth and his peers, treating &quot;his&quot; Jews with the humanity and civility that was so scarce during this age of insanity, of loss, of suffering and death.  Never before or since has ethnic cleansing succeeded so brutally in decimating the population of an entire race.  We must pray that it never does again.Schindler's story has risen like a phoenix from the ashes of this dark time.  It is a story of hope, courage, and survival.  But more than that it is the story of a man who chose good over evil, who chose love over hate, who chose understanding over prejudice.  Is it any wonder that a tree on the Avenue of the Righteous bears his name?There are a few names which have become branded in our psyche as being synonymous with the horrors of the Holocaust.  Anne Frank, whose diary etched her life and death into the hearts of millions, Simon Wiesenthal, himself an Auschwitz survivor who lost over 80 family members in the death camps, and now of course, there is Oskar Schindler, a man who was far from saintly, but a man whose deeds guaranteed him a place in heaven.  A man who &quot;saved the world entire.&quot;",N/A

118989,"I rented this movie today (will probably buy it if it comes out on DVD) because I appreciated the 1959 version with David Ladd so much.  (It is still available on VHS.)There are good things about both versions--  in the earlier, David Ladd at least attempts to sound  native to Belgium,  using their words for 'father' and 'Mrs.' if I remember correctly. Both  have happy endings.Much is added in Hollywood style for the 1999  version, however.  In fact, about halfway into the story, it pretty much  becomes a new story, compared to the earlier version.  I did like the way  the film touched on a belief in an afterlife and the good 'model' it  displays about being honest for possible kid viewers today. Some have said  the dog was cute.  He looked like a big blob with two tiny eyes to me-- and  he certainly couldn't 'act' much.  If you want to see a dog really perform,  then see &quot;My Dog Skip&quot;! Another good point-- the music score is  excellent.  I thought I had spotted a 'flaw' when the boy still had  'snow' on his hair after being in the church all night--- but then  remembered how cold those old European cathedrals really are! All in all, a  good movie for the whole family, and a an excellent way to see some great  art and scenery from Flanders, the movie being done 'on location'.",N/A

This movie incorporates many different aspects, that of a science fiction film, and a film about overcoming adversity and accepting someone for who they are. Even if they are a giant robot.

38210,"I have to admit, I didn't realize this film was actually close to (or slightly more than) three hours long until I read some of the other reviews of it! I was so completely taken in by the strange depth and profound  troubles of the characters that unfolded more and more through the film,  along with the slowly revealed motivations for their actions and their  unexpected connections to each other simultaneously, that time flew by  without my awareness.  And Mr. Tom Cruise's Academy award nomination was  no accident or publicity stunt; few times was I more impressed with an  actor's work.  The depth of this movie doesn't border on the spiritual;  you will see Exodus 8:2 as a leit motif dance through this picture- it IS  spiritual, in ways that will both blow your mind, and break your heart.I  would give it four and half stars if it were possible because of a scene  that devolves into a  music video that didn't work for me at all.

If  all you've seen of this movie is on tv or video (admittedly, the way I had)  the DVD widescreen and improved sound is going to make a HUGE difference.  The colors and textures used in the film are visceral, much like the way  Peter Weir, for example, uses them.  The movement of the wheat fields and  the motions of the insects are amazing.  Mallick, in this film, as in  Badlands, deals with the idea that flight and fight exist at the same time.  After each fight (and these are not gore in your eye knock down drag out  fights, you blink your eyes and you've missed them, but the consequences  are devastating) flight takes place, and, as in Huckleberry Finn, the  journey is interesting and wonderful.  The narration in this film, as in  Badlands is flat, almost lifeless, but the pictures that surround it are  amazing.  The narration keeps you firmly rooted while the pictures send you  soaring.  A great double feature with Badlands, and one well worth seeing.

463353,"&quot;A Simple Plan&quot; was one of the best films of 1998 and by far Sam Raimi's best film to date. At first glance, Raimi wasn't an obvious choice to bring Smith's novel to the screen. His earlier films all displayed  considerable ingeniuity but they weren't subtle by any stretch of the  imagination. In &quot;A Simple Plan&quot;, Sam Raimi is awfully reticent  and relies only on his story and his actors.The film tells the story of  three men who find four million dollars in a crashed plane. This premise,  which more resembles John Huston's &quot;The Treasure Of The Sierra  Madre&quot; than the Coen Brothers' &quot;Fargo&quot;, functions as a setup  for a study of human nature. It shows, without being pretentious, the  impact of money on a person's character. After they find the money, every  person in the film re-evaluates his former live and suddenly comes to the  conclusion that it was rather mserable, something they surely didn't think  before. At the end, two of them are dead and the live of the survivor will  be almost unbearable.The main reasons for the effectiveness of the film  are the sharply drawn chracters and the fine performances (especially by  Billy Bob Thornton). It makes the viewer feel uncomfortable because he  can't reject the actions of the protagonists as something he would not even  dream of doing. Instead we have the uncanny feeling that we would actually  react the same way under these circumstances.&quot;A Simple Plan&quot;  is haunting, poetic and endlessly intruiging film that comes close to the  status of a masterpiece.

There is a great deal of  fighting and characters do die, which brings me to my next point.  In  translating the series for American television, a great deal of effort has  been made to remove all references to death.

If Kiss has a flaw, and it does, is that it makes a hash of both  traditional vampire lore and there is no logic to its own use of vampires  in the film.  These vampires can go about during the day time provided it's  cloudy.  They eat food.  They can stick their heads out the castle window  into the sunlight.  They seem particularly weak, having to go through a  long charade to acquire victims and don't seem to really need that much  blood. Even their destruction makes no sense from a vampire point of view.

The book upon which this movie is allegedly  based is wonderful, and the movie, to put it simply, isn't.The movie has  the same basic plot, but it has been turned into a typical Disney  slapstick.  Although the jokes are often relatively funny and the actors  are obviously having fun with themselves, it really doesn't fit in the  plot.  The story of the book is also incredibly simplified, and the main  characters have been given typical &quot;hero&quot; makeovers.  Still, the  swordfights aren't horrible, and Curry is great as a sadistic, sarcastic  Richelieu.If you enjoy fun, light adventure movies, then this is a good  choice, but if you're looking for a solid adaptation of Dumas' classic  novel, look elsewhere.",The Three Musketeers Walt Disney Pictures Presents  VHS
511033,"I absolutely love it.  Like many concert videos, it waspieced together from two back-to-back shows; that's how they makethem--they film two performances and take the best shots and make one video from it. That doesn't mean that the performances are fake. And as for the editing, maybe a few fades would have been nice, but overall I find it very enjoyable (love the close-ups of Sarah!) Of my current collection, this is the DVD I watch most often, and I haven't even been a fan of hers for very long.As for the picture quality, it is fantastic. I can't rate the 5.1 channel mix because I do not yet have a Dolby Digital receiver, but I am very happy with the quality of the stereo mix, and I think that's all you need for a music program anyway.

116503,"Unlike most sci-fi action films of recent years, where the emphasis seems to be on how well things get &quot;blowed up&quot;, &quot;The Matrix&quot; has a brain and knows how to use it. It succeeds on almost every  level.Most prominently, &quot;The Matrix&quot; succeeds in showing us  violence and action in new and previously unimagined ways.Case in point:  the hyperkinetic action sequences seek not only to thrill, but also to bend  the mind, to introduce new possibilities. We all know that Keanu Reeves'  character, Neo, dodges bullets. But in a standard action film, he'd have  run away from them, or jumped off the roof.Not in &quot;The  Matrix&quot;.Instead, we get a visionary, mind-bending scene in which  we SEE Neo dodging the bullets in sweeping, amazing slow motion.Ditto  for the &quot;lobby&quot; scene, which is nothing less than a ballet of  violence, using Neo's and Trinity's ability to &quot;warp&quot; the Matrix  as a backdrop.Amazing stuff.&quot;The Matrix&quot; looks and feels  like nothing else ever made. Even the green-tinted scenes in the the  corporate &quot;matrix&quot; fantasy world that Neo's doppleganger Thomas  Anderson inhabits are so stifling and antiseptic that they're almost  menacing.And let's not forget that the premise that &quot;The  Matrix&quot; is based on - a world in which humans are unwittingly enslaved  to serve their machine masters - IS the most imaginative sci-fi premise in  years. It builds on current technologies - virtual reality, artificial  intelligence, solar power and a host of others - and seems entirely  plausible.&quot;The Matrix&quot; also has an enviable human element,  with Carrie-Anne Moss finding a great mix of toughness and vulnerability as  Trinity. Laurence Fishburne does excellent work as the enigmatic Morpheus,  though I found myself wishing we could spend less time on Morpheus'  Zen-teacher musings and more on his character. And Hugo Weaving is  beautifully understated as Agent Smith. Keanu Reeves' Neo/Thomas Anderson  is wooden, as you'd expect from him, but he does display moments of depth  along with the invariable &quot;Bill and Ted&quot; flashbacks.If  &quot;The Matrix&quot; has a flaw, it's an ending that's a little too pat  and seems more focus-group driven (not to mention sequel groundwork-driven)  than a real extension of the story. Otherwise, it's a masterpiece of action  and science fiction.And it really DOES show you just how deep the rabbit  hole goes.",N/A

Being the movie completist that I am, I wanted to see these moments  fully restored to their respective flicks.I wasn't disappointed. For the  first 'Lethal', seven minutes were restored- Riggs's (Mel Gibson) firefight  with a schoolyard sniper, Murtaugh's (Danny Glover) self-affirmation at the  firing range, and other moments. The picture quality was quite a bit  sharper than the VHS versions, and the sound was clearer, with better  separation... just what one expects from DVD!There aren't too many  extras thrown in, though.

I think, and some will agree  with me here, that the reason why people give this movie such a bad rap is  because it was the mother of all these new teeny bopper horror flicks that  have penetrated the movie scene. I (Still) Know What You Did Last Summer,  Urban Legend, the Faculty, Disturbing Behavior and now this new Final  Destination movie. People probably wouldn't complain so much if they had to  go through all that slasher hooplah that dominated the late 70's/early  80's. But it's easy to understand where they come from. Frankly, I'm  getting kind of sick of it. But Scream stands alone as the best of all of  them. Urban Legend was better? Give me a break.

450443,"Two things are essential if you want to watch this movie.  One, you have to like Gwyneth Paltrow, because you're going to see a lot of her; and two, it helps to be a girl.  Since I only half qualify I am not the best audience for this corny, but clever, three-quarters cute, romantic comedy.  Most of it is standard faire: London girl Helen (Paltrow) has to choose between puppy-eyed loser Gerry (John Lynch) and Good Guy James (John Hannah).  Circumstances make the Good Guy look bad while the puppy-eyed loser pouts real well and looks emotionally helpless, so it's tough on our good girl, who's kind of like a Brit Mary Tyler Moore for the nineties.  But &quot;she's gonna find true love.&quot;  Count on it.  It's just that there's an hour and a half of misdirection before she does.Paltrow isn't able to display anything close to her full range here, even though the film amounts to a vehicle for her.  The clever plot idea is to show her life under one set of circumstances (she misses the train and doesn't meet James) and ""a road not taken"" (she catches the train and does meet James) in alternating cuts.  Surprisingly it works fairly well.  To keep us from getting confused, her hair goes short and blonde in one set and long and dark in the other.  I like her better with dark hair.  She looks more glamorous.  I was surprised to notice that back-to-back adoring reviews on Amazon were written by eleven and twelve-year-old girls.  When I think about it, that's kind of nice, since this is a sweet movie and those tough little critics are an appropriate audience (along with me, I guess), and this is an advisory tale about the nature of men, illustrating that you have to be careful about whom you choose when you're following your heart.Most fun in the movie is the dirty deeds done by Lydia, (Jeanne Tripplehorn) Helen's rival for Gerry.  To humiliate working girl Helen she has her deliver sandwiches and then claims she got food poisoning.  To really trash her, Lydia sends her on a phony job interview at her apartment in time to catch her with weasel-willed Gerry while announcing that she's pregnant by same.

Depp is good, but his performance is a little forced.  Del Toro plays Dr.  Gonzo the way Hunter S. Thompson intended the part to be played.  He is  fat, loutish, drug addicted, and psychotic.  Best Scene of the movie:  Del  Toro in a filthy bathtub wearing a suit, tripping his brains out while  brandishing a humongous hunting knife, and Depp trying to convince him not  to kill himself by throwing a plugged in tape recorder blasting Jefferson  Airplane's &quot;white rabbit&quot; into the bathtub. The book was a  classic, but I think the movie was vastly underrated, mainly due to the  fact that Terry Gilliam is a master at capturing the essence of a work.  Gilliam is a visual master and he truly explores the effects of the  hallucinatory drugs that Depp and Del Toro are consuming mass quanities of.  Obviously, this is not family viewing.

Aside from his inexplicable addiction to the I-camera, one of the most distracting and  overrated camera techniques around, his visualization of Mission:  Impossible is cinematic, grand, and very exciting.Tom Cruise makes for a  good action hero and Jon Voight a slyly effective supporting character --  unfortunately, as the script stands, it gives the excellent supporting cast  very little to do -- the divine Emmanuelle Beart gets little more than an  object-of-desire role; Kristin Scott-Thomas holds up well but doesn't get  enough screen time to develop her character; and Emilio Estevez, Jean Reno  and Ving Rhames are all relegated to nearly bit parts, each serving his  purpose well but given little chance to excel beyond that.That said,  still an effective action thriller, commendably low on the violence  quotient, with a twisty plot that would take a while to absorb.

None of the characters were simpathetic in the  least.  I found myself rooting for the croc, just like Betty White.  This  movie could have used a cameo from Steve Irwin, of Crocidile Hunter fame,  just to give us at least one character worth rooting for.  What am I  talking about?

If you haven't seen it  at least ten times, then you are missing something. Scott dominates the  whole movie, of course, as Patton. A fierce fighting Amercian General in  World War II. So much so, in fact, that after the U.S. entered the war, the  Germans divided the Allied Forces into two groups. &quot;Patton&quot; and  &quot;Other&quot;. An aide of Patton's wrote a biography of his commander  and recommeded this movie as a distinct example of how Patton actually was!  A little understanding might enhance your enjoyment of the film after you  buy it from Amazon.com. &quot;Georgie&quot;, as his close friends called  him, was a bit of a child prodigy. In fact, you can leave out the  &quot;prodigy&quot; in some cases and leave it at &quot;child&quot;. He was  no doubt the most brillant general in World War II. In fact, he was slated  in this position when war broke out. Chief-of -Staff, General Marshall,  liked him generally. Ike was his buddy until things got out of hand. Watch  a man whole simply has everything it takes to end a war but he has one  simple flaw. The ability to be diplomatic and political. You will see how  one man can outguess, out-think, out-do, any other general. But his energy  has to be, sometimes ruthlessly, harnessed in order for him not to destroy  the political structure of his own country's offensive. We all ultimately  believe in Patton's view. Just get the job over with whether it be washing  dishes, mowing the lawn, or conducting the war. FDR and Ike were masters of  the other side of the coin. Shake hands with people you dispise. Befriend  those whom you have absolutely nothing in common with except mutual gain.  Cooperate with a country whose sole purpose is to dominate the world, and  proved that fact through the invasion of Norway before our entry. It's hard  to identify with a man who worships war.

227687,"(Review based on director's cut version) Aliens is the only true masterpiece in the entire Alien series as it not only sustains nerve wracking tension and explosive action, but also takes time to develop the  characters and create dramatic depth.  No other film in the series has been  able to do this even moderately well.Aliens takes place 57 years after  the original.  Lt.  Ellen Ripley (Sigourney Weaver) is the only survivor of  the Nostromo, where her entire crew was killed by a hostile alien creature  that seems to live only to kill and breed.  She is found by a salvage crew  and tells her story to company officials.  It's met with skepticisim but  when contact is lost with a colony on a planet (the same one where Ripley's  crew found the egg that hatched a face hugger), a team of marines is  immediately sent in along with Ripley.  Members of this crew include  Corporal Hicks (Michael Biehn), Private Vasquez (Jenette Goldstein), Lt.  Gorman (William Hope), Private Hudson (Bill Paxton), and Bishop (Lance  Henrikson), a friendly android. After exploring the empty colony they find  the only survivor, a little girl named Newt (Carrie Henn), and a bond is  already created between her and Ripley.  Not long after, the marines get  into a brief battle with the aliens that proves fatal.  Most of the marines  are killed and taken back to the alien nest for cocooning.  Now, Ripley and  six others must survive in a colony infested with over hundreds of aliens  and find a way to escape.The aspect of Aliens that most everybody loves  this film for is the action.  Most of it doesn't actually begin until the  last 45 minutes of the film but it's truly exciting, tense, and non-stop.  I can see why this film is considered a roller coaster ride.  Particularly,  the best sequences are when the aliens chase the remaining humans into  small tunnels and when Ripley arms herself to the max and rescues Newt.  Director James Cameron established himself as a true action auteur with  this film and it's easy to see why he's so revered by legions of  fans.There's a deep dramatic depth in this film along with character  development.  Despite the fact that the film has a running time of 154  minutes, it never feels long and the character interaction is far from dull  and boring.  There's three very interesting relationships that develops  from Ripley to Newt, Hicks, and Bishop.  After the death of her daughter,  Ripley finds solace and comfort with Newt, who also likes Ripley's company.  They form a tight mother-daughter bond.  Another relationship that  develops is between Ripley and Hicks.  It's all quite subtle but it's  actually very fun to watch.  The peak of this relationship is not when they  kiss as in most films(they actually never do kiss) but when they exchange  their first names and one wishes the other luck.  The other interesting  development is between Ripley and Bishop.  After the first film, Ripley  distrusted all android since one of them indirectly caused the deaths of  her whole crew.  She dislikes Bishop at first but it's easy to tell she  admires him by the end.All the performances in this film come off  strong.  Weaver is the best as she creates a strong and take charge  heroine.  Her character is a lot more complex than what is portrayed in  Alien.  Michael Biehn is very good as Corporal Hicks, a brave but far from  gung-ho soldier.  Also delivering good performances are Carrie Henn, Lance  Henrikson, Bill Paxton, and Jenette Goldstein.  Henrikson's character is  the one the audience seems to think is untrustworthy since he rarely  displays any signs of emotion.  But he's actually quite caring and is  perhaps the most trustworthy of the entire marine crew.Once again, like  the first movie, the special effects are excellent.  The creature effects  are slightly different in this one as the aliens appear to be a bit more  scaly with smaller heads but the end result is still a frightening  creature.Also noteworthy is a fine musical score from James Horner.  It's creepy, fast-paced, and fits the tone of the film just fine.If you  have never seen any films in the Alien series, I would recommend you begin  with Alien, a pretty good and decent (though not spectacular) horror space  opera.  Then you should watch Aliens but stop after that.  The opening  scenes to Alien 3 ruin all the development that occured in Aliens.  Alien  Resurrection itself is okay, but Weaver's character takes a turn for the  worst.",N/A

I could never convince myself to buy the series on VHS  (besides which, I had taped them from TV), but will be buying the entire  series on DVD.Unfortunately, as others have said before me, there is  little on the DVD besides the two episodes each themselves. Just the  trailer from televison. More could have been done here -- thus I took away  a 'star' for this. However, the quality of the transfer is excellent and  will present you with many hours of re-enjoying the adventures once again  (assuming that you enjoyed them in the first place).For those of you who  have not seen ST:TOS, I favor it over later Star Trek releases because of  the unique personal interaction between the primary members of the crew  (Kirk, Spock, McCoy, Scotty). This is the strengh of the series, and was  not duplicated in later Star Trek releases.So ....  If you enjoy a  somewhat hokey space adventure (remember, the charm of the series is the  crew interaction mentioned above) and/or would like to see the show that  started it all, this is a purchase you probably won't want to pass  up.~unabashed recommendation~Beam me up, Scotty.",N/A

The one thing that I have noticed is that many people say that this is a bad  horror movie. For anyone that has seen the Evil Dead trilogy, you should  recognize that THIS IS NOT A HORROR MOVIE! It is the most entertaining  movie (along with the Holy Grail) ever made. I don't think Raimi had any  intentions of scaring people, he wanted to produce the movie as eye candy.  He was trying to do something different that does not fit any one genre of  style, and succeeded. Do not watch this movie with any expectations: except  to experience a wonderful 90 minutes of eye candy and great one- liners.",N/A

118590,"Be warned, as you watch 'Eyes Wide Shut'; if you are expecting an erotic thriller, or a fast-paced suspense film, or a 'By-the-Numbers' formula picture, you will be disappointed! Stanley Kubrick always searched for  themes that would challenge viewers, and force them to see the world in a  different light. 'Eyes Wide Shut', his final film, certainly does that, and  is a film that will be enjoyed more with repeated viewings.What is  reality? This film challenges us to make our own conclusions, as we see the  story of a  Yuppie couple unfold. Tom Cruise, as the husband, has a  successful career, but is shallow and superficial, coasting along on his  looks and social contacts. Nicole Kidman, his unemployed spouse, is a good  wife and mother, but bored, and compensates by drinking and flirting, and  fantasizing about a Naval officer she'd seen the previous summer. As she  acknowledges her erotic daydreams to Cruise, he reacts, first with  jealousy, then with a desire to find an outlet for the sexual frustration  he feels. Thus begins nighttime odysseys into a dreamlike world of  discovery; of a friend's unfulfilled desires, of a dual-personality hooker,  of a teenager being pimped by her father, of a cult which may only promote  orgies, or may have a far more sinister intent.Nothing is spelled out,  or made obvious, and Kubrick throws in clues which will have you reaching  conclusions that you may find will change, when the film is viewed again!  'Eyes Wide Shut' demands your full attention, and rewards you with an  enigma! Is ANYTHING what it seems? The film's final line, delivered by  Kidman, is coarse, but totally in keeping with Cruise's journey, throughout  the film, and provides the director a wry closure to this most unusual  film!While 'Eyes Wide Shut' will never be rated as highly as '2001',  'The Shining', 'A Clockwork Orange', or 'Dr. Strangelove', it is  provocative and mysterious, and deserves your attention!",N/A

It is the perfect film for when you want something exciting to  watch that wouldn't tax the intelligence of a carpet slug and which will  make the most damaged intellect smile and then laugh out loud.Don't  believe anyone who says that this film is anything but a comedy but watch  it again and again and again.

The additional footage on the DVD, along with the  commentary, makes for quite the fun second and third viewing!

328625,"Moody Blues fans have long enjoyed and admired the group's unique ability to capture visual imagery in music.  In this respect, Live at Red Rocks is a crowning achievement.The beautiful Red Rocks Amphitheater provides a  uniquely appropriate setting for the Moodies' haunting blend of rock  melodies and classical accompaniments.  The video does an excellent job of  incorporating the scenery into the musical flow of the  presentation.Several facets of this production are noteworthy.  The film  masterfully captures the interplay between the band and the audience, long  one of the group's touring trademarks.  It also does a wonderful job of  documenting the three generation span of Moody Blues enthusiasts, scanning  the attendees to reveal middle aged grandparents in casual clothing,  twenty-something hippee wannabees, and some fully involved pre-teens, all  lost in the rapture of a major Moodies event.Viewers with a good ear  will notice that many of the vocals have a slightly strained quality, not  sounding quite as good as one might expect from the likes of Hayward, Lodge  and Thomas.  This is because Justin was fighting a nasty case of laryngitis  the night the video was filmed.  Even with that disadvantage, the music  still manages to be far beyond ordinary.So far as the music, the normal  repertoire is here.  Standard stage versions of classics like Nights in  White Satin, Lovely to See You, Story in Your Eyes and their traditional  closer, Ride My SeeSaw are included.  A true highlight is a magnificent  version of New Horizons, powerfully enhanced by a dynamic orchestral  background score.When all is considered, A Night at Red Rocks is a true  five-star experience.

421733,"Film director Lucio Fulci is an intersting case. On the one hand, his work is often very sloppy and slapdash. On the other hand, his films often boast  individual scenes, shots and ideas that prove the man was not without  talent. City of the Living Dead contains a goodly number of such moments,  and is therefore well worth the time of Horror film aficiandos. All the  usual objections apply: bad script, bad dubbing, no characterization to  speak of, etc. But the film works as a collection of hallucinogenic moments  (a supernatural burst of flame in an apartment, an apparition that causes  people to weep blood, gusts of wind-swept maggots) of disturbing, dreamlike  horror. He also manages to create and sustain an odd, nightmarish  atmosphere throughout. And I love the fact that Fulci had the nerve to tack  on a puzzling denouement that probably made no sense even to him.

317713,"A sad ending to Roger Moore's mostly distinquished career as the World's Greatest Spy. Pointless and void of any real drama,&quot;View to a Kill&quot; joins &quot;Moonraker&quot; and &quot;Tomorrow Never Dies&quot; in the dubious category of all-time 007 stinkers. Moore should've called it quits after &quot;Octopussy&quot;, his highly enjoyable romp from 1983. To blame the aging Moore for &quot;View's&quot; many pratfalls, however, is missing the point. The plot to destroy Silicon Valley with an earthquake seems implausible. The usually creepy Christopher Walken scares absolutely no one as arch-villain Max Zorin. Walken and Grace Jones (May Day) commit the ultimate sin of Bond villainy --- they're flat out boring. Even worse, however, is Tanya Roberts' inept Bond Girl Stacey Sutton. Her performance is sadly laughable. In fact, if not for Denise Richards in &quot;The World is Not Enough&quot;, Roberts would be sole possessor of the Worst Bond Girl Award. On the bright side the stunts are top-notch, especially the jump from the Eiffel Tower. The fight atop the Golden Gate Bridge is very well staged. However, the fire-truck chase through the streets of San Francisco is ludicrous. It's almost as if the producers, obviously blank on ideas, intentionally chose the most cliched of locations (the overused San Francisco)and decided to appeal to the lowest common demoninator by staging yet another &quot;Bullit&quot;-like race up and down that city's hilly streets. That stuff belongs on an episode of &quot;Nash Bridges&quot;, not a Bond flick. Ugh! And as a final point of contention, there's the truly awful title song courtesy of Duran Duran.(Of course, it topped the charts! Go figure...)The saving grace of &quot;View&quot; is the DVD package itself. As always, MGM is to be commended for a job well done. Included is the highly informative documentary &quot;Inside View to a Kill&quot;, which I found to be far more interesting than the movie itself. Another worthwhile documentary included with &quot;View&quot; is &quot;The Music of James Bond&quot;. Also of interest are director John Glen's audio commentary and the original theatrical trailers. &quot;View To a Kill&quot; will satisfy only over-zealous Bond fanatics, such as myself, who just have to have all the extra goodies that come with the DVD. Overall, a one star movie presented in a four star package.",N/A

It might as well be a series of still frames with talking  dubbed over it.  There's a scene near the end where the captain is talking  with an ex-terrorist, and he has his back to the camera the whole time so  they didn't even have to animate that.  I'm not saying that I expect  destruction and gore, but they could at least move around a little.  They  could at least go for a walk or something while they talk, instead of just  showing one frame of animation for ten minutes while two people talk about  war.

484802,"Much like Grosse Pointe Blank (a film by the same team as High Fidelity), this film takes advantage of John Cusack's skills.Cusack is the everyman. In the 80s he appeared in a slew of teen love comedy's that a whole generation learned to identify with. In High Fidelity he does it again for Gen-Xers.The movie has a certain poignancy that I think many late-20 to early 30-somethings of today can easily understand. One might almost call it a chick flick for guys. The tone of the movie is prefectly set by a complimentary mix of humor and subject matter. The characterization is strong for the most part, however there are some plot holes and slow points that keep this from being a five star film. Still, the film is too enjoyable to vote it at a 3 or lower.The DVD contains several deleted scenes. Generally this is a mixed blessing. I will watch these scenes and then drop to my knees and praise the editor for doing his job correctly. However in the case of High Fidelity, there were several scenes that I actually wish had remained included. This miht have added some cohesiveness to the plot. Still, as I said above, there were points that the film did move slowly, particularly towards the end. So perhaps, adding more minutes to the film would have been the wrong idea. One might imagine that the movie could have been cut better to include the key points of some of these scenes while still keeping the film at a length where there was no attention drain.All in all, I do recommend this movie. Particularly for anyone who has a love of counterculture or has found themselves feeling as though their life, and especially their love-life, was ever in a point where they felt lost or hopeless and they have enough masochism in their hearts to want to relive that.

What they were trying to do is to combine Marlowe's &quot;Faustus&quot; and Leroux's &quot;Phantom of the Opera.&quot; Now on the positive side, the music is memorable. Williams is really captivating as the devil's representative. Finley is memorable as the poor man who has his music stolen, becomes disfigured, unknowingly makes an unholy deal, and rises to save the naive Phoenix from Williams' evil. The story is well knit, and the events do seem to flow well. There is even dramatic irony in that Finley wrote his music about &quot;Faustus,&quot; and he himself will take on the role of Faustus. It is even nice that they have Finley visibly play the end credits so we don't feel too depressed in the end. Images are done well, and the general acting is pretty good. I am not sure the speeded up scenes really belong, and I think some of the humor is too low class. (Like when Finley goes to jail and has to have his teeth removed.)

The Godzilla suit  that they used in the film is probobly the &quot;cutest&quot; of all of the  series. He has a puppy like face with huge cute light brown eyes. His  dorsal spines that made him look scary in the original 1956 Godzilla movie  is all but lost here. They were sharp, jaggad, and uneven but 17 years  later they look soft, light, and puffy. Another character that made the  film intresting was the robot Jet Jaguar made by the inventor Goro. Who  thought by the end of the film that Jet Jaguar would grow abot 200 feet to  help Godzilla battle Megalon. Then all of a sudden Gigan appears. Its an  all out slugfest as Godzilla and Jet Jaguar battle against Megalon and  Gigan! Its a full 10 minutes of nothing but pure monster battle! It is very  fake, but it is a really cool ending, one of the best of the Godzilla  series.

Maggie Smith is awsome  (and look who plays the young Wendy). Cameos abound to make the viewing  fun, and the performers do well. The visual effects are awsome, flying is  so well done you wonder how he does it, and the first view of NeverLand  demands that you have a Widescreen version of this film... if you choose to  buy it.The plot, briefly, is about an adult Peter living in contemporary  society (just ignore the fact that he would be about 100 years old at this  point... IT'S A FANTASY!). He is a corporate lawyer who is fast losing  touch with his family and himself. A trip to London to see family  brings  back old enemies. Peter must go to NeverLand, fight Hook, and get his  children back. The pirates are suitably grungy and aged, but the Lost Boys  are the biggest letdown. Rather than the collection of late 19th and  turn-of-the-century children you would expect, you get a bunch of  streetwise urchins from any time period up to present day. And, hey, they  don't fly! The movie boils down to the final Pan vs Hook  confrontation.Those claiming the movie is over-violent should look more  carefully. Only ONE person dies. All of the Lost Boys' weapons are the most  non-violent weapons seen. With all the sword-play, no one is even  scratched. It might have been better had there been more loss for the  audience to care about. The movie seems to dwell too long on some parts,  not long enough in others. You watch the movie to get to the moments of  revelation; Peter finding out who he is, seeing NeverLand for the first  time, Peter finding his Happy Thought and what that thought is, him finally  becoming Pan again...The John Williams score is, per usual, top-notch.  The music adds emotional impact at moments when needed, heightening the  mood in others. All of his music is a great ride.If you liked the movie  enough to want to buy it at all, get a clean copy that allows you to see  EVERYTHING.

Those looking for a little bit of substance in their film need not apply to this one, audiences who want to grab a bag of popcorn and have some fun, will certainly get their money's worth out of this fast paced 'cartoon.'Calling this film a cartoon may sound like an insult, but with this film, that's not the case.  With this movie, we get loads of colorful characters and some crazy stunt work.  The story is one that you've seen a ton of times previously, and if you haven't it's still predictable.  Randall &quot;Memphis&quot; Reins (Nicolas Cage) is an ex-car thief who once was 'the best' in the business.  Reins is lured back into the business when his dopey brother (Giovanni Ribisi) gets on the bad side of a notorious criminal called 'The Carpenter'.  Reins comes rushing, reluctantly at first, to little brother's aid and in order to have the little man's life spared, Reins, along with his brother, must steal 50 cars in 24 hours for 'The Carpenter' or both of them will be killed.  There's some bits of Reins assembling the old gang he used to steal cars with including the sexy Angelina Jole-an ex-girlfriend with an attitude.  Master actor Robert Duvall is also on hand as the theif's mechanic.  Reins back on his old turf even makes a local gang very unhappy and just for good meausre, we get to see the car thieves dealing with these dopes in a few very amusing scenes.  Another main character is a cop (Delroy Lindo) who sees Reins back in town and vows to catch him this time out.  To this cop, Reins is like Moby Dick, and although this is nothing original, the cat and mouse, hide and seek game played between these two guys is also very fun.Gone in 60 Seconds is concerned less about plot and characters and more about cars and style.  The thing about this movie though, is that for a movie about cars, we only get one car chase.  Granted it is a long and exciting one toward the film's finish, but those expecting this one to be all chase will probably be disappointed.  But, if you're just looking for two hours of escapist fun, this is a really great movie.  There's nothing too special about any of it, but if you know what you're getting into, there's just a general aura of fun about the whole thing.This movie won't appeal to prudish viewers who believe themselves above a silly good time, fans of The Rock and Con Air should have a pretty decent idea of what they're getting into.

180967,"I admit to not liking this film when I saw it in the theater all those years ago.  I thought it trite and that it suffered from multiple personality disorder, since it started out as standard Quentin Tarantino crime-fare and wound up a vamp splatter fest.  I'm pleased to say that repeated viewings have increased my appreciation for &quot;From Dusk Till Dawn&quot;.The Gecko Brothers, George Clooney (in his best role yet) and Quentin himself, are bank robbers and complete badasses.  Seth is the cool, collected one, self-assured and able to control his inner rage.  Richard, on the other hand, is dimensia on two legs, giving in to his blood lust as though it were a heroin high.  The two are on their way to a rendezvous with a man who can make them &quot;disappear&quot; until the heat dies down.For reasons we don't need to get into, the pair kidnap Harvey Keitel, faith-lapsed preacher, and his two children and force them to help them across the border.  The rendezvous takes place at ... a biker bar cum strip club built on the ruins of an old temple.  The kicker?  The temple/bar houses gazillions of vampires who feed on the truckers and bikers who frequent the place and, presumably, keep the bar going by selling  the cargo in their pirated trucks.The shift from crime to horror is not as abrupt as it sounds.  In several instances, director Rodriguez suggests that the carnage exacted on the bar's patrons is no more horrible than that Richie Gecko inflicts on the people with whom he comes in contact.  In a way, Richie is a vampire already, an opportunist who feeds on adrenaline and power.Keitel seems horribly miscast in his role, but comes off believably and even sympathetically.  Juliette Lewis is annoying, as usual, but that at least gives us some pleasure hoping she gets fang-fu'ed by one of the vamps.  The kid who plays Keitel's son is acceptable.  But the person who really shines is woodface Clooney; for once, his underacting really pays off.  He even comes across as sympathetic toward the end.The extras and vampires are wonderful.  Other bar patrons who (mostly) survive are funny, macho cartoon characters.  Salma Hayek, in her too brief appearance, is absolutely electric.This is a goofy film that requires very little from the viewer beyond a strong stomach and a sense of humor.  I wanted a tad more backstory, since I was confused about the many types of vampires that seemed to exist - some were batlike, some were snakelike and some seemed wolflike.  I would have expected a little clan infighting among these different species and wanted to know more about how they came to be.But that's not what this movie is about.",N/A
99301,"well, I just so it for the second time in my life about an hour a go!  It was something allright!  the perfect kind of exploration of human mind and the unresistably intersting and hilarious charecters make this movie one of  the best films I've ever seen!  Probably the greatest thing of all in this  movie is the acting score. I mean, I'd really like to see Cristopher Lloyd,  Danny DeVito or Jack Nicholson himself in a better role than this is!  Of  course, everything is nearly perfect in this milestone masterpiece!",One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest

Watching it for the first time in the theater, I remember being so amazed by how good it was, I started to TRY to find flaws in the film,  but I just couldn't. I think that it's literally flawless. Totally orginal  and endlessly funny, &quot;Being John Malkovich&quot; will be remembered  for a long, long time.",N/A
99349,"One day, Randall Patrick McMurphy (Nicholson) has a great idea. His prison sentence has a couple of months left to run and he gets himself assigned to a psychiatric hospital for evaluation. It means no more work detail in prison and he sees it as an amusing break.In the hospital he runs up against his ward's boss, nurse Mildred Ratched (Fletcher). She appears nice but dominates, bullies and humiliates the men and sadistically crushes any initiative. When the doctors feel that McMurphy is swinging the lead and should be passed back to the prison service, Ratched views him as unfinished business and angles to keep him in the hospital.For McMurphy, his holiday in the hospital seems to be going well. Despite occasional frustrations and disciplinary issues, he is enjoying himself and, from the viewer's perspective, he appears to be making a difference to the lives of some of the other patients. Nurse Ratched does not view this difference as a benefit.Finally, McMurphy's &quot;holiday&quot; is interrupted when he learns that there is a big difference between the hospital and prison. He can on longer expect automatic release when his sentence is up. Far from it, he discovers that he faces a much longer stay than he expected.Jack Nicholson is absolutely brilliant in this film. His portrayal of McMurphy is the best piece of acting that I have ever seen. The viewer is totally immersed in this character and it makes the hospital environment completely convincing. The rest of the cast do a fine job as assorted other patients. Playing a mentally ill character is never easy but they are convincing as they swing from being a collection of disturbed individuals to a bunch of guys under the influence of McMurphy.",One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest
420675,"Is it possible that a film adaptation of an opera can actually surpass a staged version? In the case of this Madame Butterfly, I would have to  answer with a resounding YES. I've seen this opera a couple of times in  opera houses. Each performance was beautiful, of course. But it wasn't  until I saw this film that this masterpiece truly came alive for me. The  film is stunning.  Puccini's gorgeous music, the singing, the cast, the  scenery... everything about this film is perfection itself. If you have  even the slightest interest in opera, please do yourself a huge favor and  wallow in this film. Make sure to have a hankie on hand, and that goes for  you guys too. My only regret is that this Madame Butterly is unavailable on  DVD, I hope Sony Pictures gets around to it soon. If ever a movie deserved  to be on DVD, Madame Butterfly certainly does.",Madame Butterfly VHS

463780,"She's all that was a fantastic movie.  i saw it at the theatre and on video, and i thought it was great.  the main chracters are so cute in their romance, because they don't realize that they are falling in love.  i loved  the Rockefeller Skank dance sequence.  Rachael Leigh Cook is so beautiful,  that the transformation takes very little to work.  Freddie Prinze, Jr.  smashes all your ideas about how jocks are, and plays them how they should  be.  She's all That shows what high school really was like for a lot of  people, and does a good job of showing how different and alike the social  groups can sometimes be.",N/A
