524607,"Rules of Engagement is a gripping courtroom thriller that has a lot of plot holes just as soon as you start thinking about all the situations that occurred.  It has two things going for it:  terrific acting and fine direction from William Friedkin, and both elements are able to withstand the flaws.The film's best parts are in the first half hour, featuring two riveting action sequences, involving the jungle hell of Vietnam and the rescue of the ambassador in Yemen.  The rest of the film can't quite match this in intensity, but then again, that only goes to prove that Friedkin can stage an action sequence.The ending is when the film starts to lose steam.  No major revelation occurs, the entire trial moves in a straightforward, routine manner, and in the end, it feels anti-climactic, as if though nothing huge was accomplished.",N/A

561524,"Like most movie parodies, ""Scary Movie"" starts out well then begins to head downhill as it exhausts the possibilities of its limited material.  Certainly, few genres are as rife for self-satire as the teen slasher films that have proliferated in theatres ever since the early 1980's.  Seeing, however, as even some of the earliest ""Friday the 13th"" and ""Halloween"" films seem like ancient history to today's core movie going public, ""Scary Movie"" draws upon more contemporary examples of the genre like ""Scream"" and ""I Know What You Did Last Summer"" as its source of inspiration.  In its opening stretches, ""Scary Movie"" has a great deal of fun parodying the many ludicrous conventions that have long defined these films:  the use of 30-year old actors to portray empty-headed, nubile adolescents; the heavy emphasis on teen sexuality and partial nudity; the inane actions of the killer's victims who seem to do everything possible to hurl themselves into dangerous situations; and the oh-so-predictable false scare (usually caused by a leaping cat) followed immediately by the inevitable killer's attack.Directed by Keenan Ivory Wayans and boasting a screenplay concocted by no fewer than six (count `em SIX) writers, ""Scary Movie"" establishes a high speed rhythm and pace that the filmmakers manage to sustain through most of the film's 88-minute running time - though there is a noticeable tendency on the part of the film to lag in the last half hour.  Part of the problem could be that, as with most films made up essentially of sound and sight gags haphazardly strung together, it is inevitable that some of the bits will succeed better than others and that, as the movie rolls along, the inspiration will run a little dry and the humor will become less spontaneous and more forced.  Indeed, this type of movie genre parody has always worked best when applied in small doses on TV series like ""Saturday Night Live,"" ""In Living Color"" and even the ""Carol Burnett Show.""  Stretched out to full length, such concepts often suffer the curse of diminishing returns.Occasionally, the screenplay edges so close to the limits of good taste that one may question whether or not the material is truly appropriate for the age group at which the movie is obviously targeted.  The crudity is actually much more comically effective when it is merely hinted at than when it is so openly spelled out and displayed.  But then subtlety is not exactly a strong suit of the straight horror movie genre either.""Scary Movie"" is, at least, blessed with a winning, game cast made up of appropriately post adolescent actors who understand well the mannerisms and speech patterns of the stereotypes they embody.  The overall good-natured quality of the film and its fairly high laugh ratio of gems to clunkers make ""Scary Movie"" an imperfect but generally likeable popcorn entertainment.",Scary Movie

20879,"The movie begins very suspensefull rightaway. The openingsscene is very disturbing and the strongest scene of the movie.After that, the movie takes some time to show the characters lives and explain everything. If you  don't really pay attention this could be a bit boring but it is needed to  make this movie so good and suspensefull.  But this also makes this a movie  wich is very thrilling and good when you see it for the first time, but not  to watch it for a second time.But the best thing of the movie is, like a  lot people are saying, the ending. It is very disturbing but logic. I won't  say more about it than that it is the best ending I have seen in a movie  for quite a long time.The performances of Jeff Bridges and Tim Robbins  are very good but especialy Joan Cusack is very good though it is a bit  strange to see her in this kind of movie. But she is very believable as  Cheryl Lang.So if you like good and a bit scary thrillers, you  deffinitly have to see &quot;Arlington Road&quot;.  But don't buy it.",N/A
361912,"First and foremost, I really enjoyed this film, as evidenced by the 5 stars I gave it.  However, there are some problems I had with the film and  the DVD release of it.  First of all, The Crow follows James O'Barr's  original story quite closely, with the addition of some characters such as  Top Dollar's sister the Asian mystic, and Top Dollar's assassin/bodyguard.  I found that the Asian mystic took away from the film.  She was added in in  order to play the role that the skeleton portrayed in the book, but her  feeble lines and lack of acting ability took away from this film for me.  I  also hold this film responsible for the unfortunate current trend in  selling a movie based on the soundtrack.  The soundtrack to The Crow was  well thought out, and utilized much of the music that James O'Barr listened  to while writing The Crow.  Irritatingly enough, Trent Reznor is featured  as well, covering a Joy Division song - the soundtrack should have just  featured Joy Division - but Reznor was flavor-of-the-month when this film  was released in '94 and his popularity sells records.  I was disappointed  to see James O'Barr take his creation and sell it off - The Crow was never  meant to move beyond the initial story, but O'Barr got greedy and now  there's a plethora of comics featuring the Crow, and even a complete  cheese-ball of a sequel that made me sick to watch (see my review of The  Crow: City of Angels).  There's even talk of a third movie, to further  disgrace Brandon Lee's memory and the reason for the writing of The Crow to  begin with.  A TV series cropped up a few years back that the Sci-Fi  Channel is running in syndication - it generally follows the ideals of the  film and I have found some of the episodes enjoyable to watch.  The DVD was  put together nicely (one review said the picture quality was too dark, but  the DVD has the same level of brightness as on VHS as well as when the film  was first on the silver screen).  I was really hoping for some extras: the  theatrical trailer, the interview snippet that was included on the  widescreen VHS, and the unreleased footage of Eric and the skeleton.  A  secondary audio-only track would have been nice, especially with all the  thought that went into both the score by Graeme Revell and the soundtrack.  But the most important part is the film itself, and that is reason enough  to purchase the DVD.  The Crow is an incredible film, and a fitting final  piece for Brandon Lee's talent.",N/A
484048,"Nineteen ninety-nine was an outstanding year for adaptations of major literary works, but of all the great books that came to the screen last  year, this is my favorite.  John Irving's novel and adaptation is one of  the most complete stories I can remember in many years.  It is poignant,  exhilarating, and astutely human in its scope, presenting a myriad of human  emotions and experiences.Often, when a story attempts to cross genres so  broadly, it fails from lack of depth or insufficiency of the writer or  director to meet the variable demands of such a wide-ranging treatment.  This film was a comedy, a tragedy, a romance, a human-interest story, a  character study, and a period piece, and each element was excellently  done.This was all accomplished without sacrificing the philosophical and  emotional depth Irving imbues in all his works.  Irving weaves a strong  moral into this story; that rules need to be questioned and that being  human is not so easily codified.  He revisits this theme repeatedly, with  each character facing dilemmas regarding societal and personal rules that  are difficult to reconcile in the given situations.If there is one thing  that stands out about this story, it is its human realism.  These are  ordinary people struggling with problems we all face.  We come to have  affection for almost all of them, and can identify with their tribulations.  Although the story is excessively sentimental and fatalistic, it reminds  us that life is complicated and doesn't always turn out the way we plan or  hope.From a filmmaking perspective, we could not have asked more from  Lasse Hallstrom.  Known most in the U.S. for his direction of `What's  Eating Gilbert Grape', Hallstrom has been making wonderful films in Europe  for almost twenty years.  However, this film will certainly go down as his  finest work.  In the featurette on the DVD, he said that when he goes to  Blockbuster with his daughter and sees it on the shelf, he will have a  feeling of pride; and well he should.This motion picture was beautifully  filmed with rich cinematography, breathtaking locations, and precise period  props and costumes.  However, the greatest achievement for Hallstrom,  working in concert with Irving, was to orchestrate a large cast in such a  way that no character seemed insignificant.  Hallstrom took great care to  do enough development of each character (often just visually without any  dialogue) that he made us care for each of them.  He gave the film an  emotional depth and breadth that is difficult to achieve in two hours.  His  work with the children in the orphanage was superb, bringing forth their  innocence and enthusiasm without minimizing their plight.The acting was  uniformly outstanding.  Tobey Maguire infused Homer with the right  combination of idealism, naivet&eacute; and inner strength to make him an  unassuming but powerful lead.  Charlize Theron continues to impress me with  her acting ability.  Besides her enchanting girl-next-door attractiveness,  she showed terrific range in a character that at first seemed shallow, but  later proved to be quite complex.Michael Caine has had a legendary  career spanning close to half a century.  He has long been one of my  favorite actors.  His performance here was powerful and well deserving of  the acclaim he received.  Dr. Larch was an extremely complex character;  egotistical, self-abusive, manipulative and recalcitrant, yet a saintly,  self-sacrificing and loving crusader for the good of the children.  Caine's  ability to span that range was remarkable.Finally, I have the highest  praise for Delroy Lindo as Mr. Rose, the orchard foreman.  Lindo's bright  smile and enthusiasm created a rock solid character with charm, strength  and simple wisdom.  He captures our admiration immediately, and despite his  despicable act, we cannot help but pity him in the end.After having seen  all the films that were nominated by the Academy for best picture last  year, I have to say that this was my personal favorite.  It wasn't as  flashy as the rest; in fact, this was downright old fashioned in its  approach.  They just don't write stories like this anymore, and that's a  shame.  I rated it a 10/10.  In its quiet way, it captured my heart.",The Cider House Rules VHS

555538,"This dull biopic treats the life of Michel de Nostradamus so superficially that each event is only dressing for the visions that are his claim to fame. Unfortunately, director Roger Christian presents these in such a pop way that by the time Michel is painting a swastika on the wall, the audience is laughing. Perhaps there is no way to present the prophecies visually without failing. It's hard not to view Nostradamus as a know-it-all since we have the benefit of hindsight, but that doesn't explain his efforts to alter what he sees in the world, which you would think is pointless. The cast is a mire of accents, although some of the actors do make an impression. This is possibly the best film opportunity Amanda Plummer had up to the 1995 release year of the film, since Daniel in 1983, and as Catherine de Medici she does well. Maja Morgenstein brings a Maria Callas mystery and passion to her role as Helene, and F Murray Abraham seems to have fun as Scalinger. Tcheky Karyo, who resembles the young George Segal, plays Nostro as a passive Christ, when what is needed is the demonism Rutger Hauer brings to his cameo.",N/A
159827,"I loved this movie.  After renting a string of movies while recovering from surgery I liked this one so much I went out and bought it.  Jennifer  Anniston is very good in the comedic role, the same sort of roll as on  Friends, but she is much less of an airhead character in this movie.  But,  my favorite in the movie is Jay Mohr.  He spends much of the movie with  &quot;Puppy Dog Eyes&quot; for Jennifer but holds his ground.  Excellent  change from his role in Jerry McGuire.Basic story is Girl (Kate) wants  Boy (Sam) and job recognition, girl isn't getting either.  Girl's friend  leads people to believe that she is engaged to another boy (Jay playing  Nick) who she has only met once at a wedding.  Nick gets famous and Kate's  life gets complicated.  She tries to get Nick to come play the part (for  money, which he refuses) and he agrees to &quot;come to dinner&quot;.  Meanwhile Nick is falling hard for Kate but she doesn't want it.  Or does  she?  As with many real life situations she doesn't realize what she is  missing until it is to late (or is it?).  Also thrown in is some really  interesting information about teh dog-eat-dog world of promotions general  and specifically the advertising business.If you want a light hearted  &quot;chick flick&quot; (as my husband would call it) get some popcorn and  definately rent this one!One side interesting fact.

156054,"The 1st being &quot;An American Werewolf in London&quot; this movie is  good,but their is a reason &quot;American&quot; won the Oscar for best  effects.  That reason:they are better than the effects in this film. I was  impressed by this movie though,to be honest,when I first saw it in 1980 it  scared me half to death. It is a very effective horror movie and well worth  the time to check out. As a matter of fact,this and &quot;American  Werewolf&quot; are the best werewolf movies ever.

195346,"Tokuma Sentai Shinesman also known as Special Duty Combat Unit Shinesman is a Power Ranger pardoy and so much more.  The story begins with a cute guy named Matsumotto Hiroya who in part of the first episode tells the  audience about how he became Shinesman Red.

Based on his answer to one of the questions at the interview he becomes  enlisted as a member of the Shinesman team.The really funny stuff about  this anime besides the lousy colors, sorry weapons (like the business card  cutter, and tie clip bombs) is the dialogue and the way the humor is set  up.  Some anime tends to have humor that doesn't make the culture  transition from Japanese type humor to humor that a Western could  accept,  understand, like, or appreciate but this one does so perfectly.

554580,"This DVD is definately worth purchasing but not for the movie (explained at the end).Heavy Metal 2000 is a linear plot about a woman seeking revenge on a lunatic, posessed by an alien power, who destroyed her home planet.Standard science fiction plot with no twists.The single story line is a departure from the vingette style of the original heavy metal movie.  This has the advantage of allowing a more coherent plot but has the disadvantage of not letting the artists explore as many different scenes and visual styles as they did in the original.  I think that the illustration style of the sequel is better but not as original as the first movie.  My personal pet peeve is the introduction of a poorly done CGI (computer generated image) at the end.  Gimmicky and not effective.The sound effects are well done if you have a digital surround sound arrangement.  However, the highlight of the movie is the great hard core soundtrack.  Changing the DVD to the isolated sound track and just playing it for the music is well worth it.But the best reason to buy the DVD is the featurette on Julie Strain.

465247,"The Thin Red Line has been a hotbed of debate between its supporters and detractors ever since its 1998 release.  Many people consider it among the greatest films to which they have beared witness. Others loathe it as three  hours of their wasted. If great art can be defined as something which  evokes powerful emotions, then The Thin Red Line certainly will meet that  criteria.  Just take a look as the impassioned arguments for or against the  film in any of these reviews.  I think the reason the film has such a mixed  response is that it reached a far greater audience that it probably was  catering to. The director, Terrence Malick, made two critically-acclaimed  masterpieces in the 70s that, while certainly influencial, never reached a  wide audience outside film-buffs.  With the The Thin Red Line Fox pictures  made shrewd (financial) decisions in marketing it as a competitor to Saving  Private Ryan as the year's best war flick.  Certainly this caused the film  to make significantly more money and also have the opportunity to be seen  by some who otherwise would have probably missed it if it only played in  art-house cinemas. On the other hand, The Thin Red Line was subjected to  the invetible comparisons to Saving Private Ryan despite the two being  worlds apart.  Because of this the standard American-movie going public was  treated to a nearly post-modern film lasting three hours with endlessly  complex messsages and themes.With the requisite background aside, The  Thin Red Line to be a masterpiece. Martin Scorcese may have put it best  when he described The Thin Red Line (he ranked it the 2nd best film of the  90s) as a film where one doesn't have to watch from the beginning to end.  While there is certailny a linear chain of events in the film. There is no  specific delineation of time and the flow of action is vastly different  from typical Hollywood fare.The story ostensibly follows a company of  recruits and their endeavors to take Guadalcanal. Malick uses about six  different narrators and doesn't feel the need to differentiate between  them. Some people decry this as confusing. However, Malick's use this  technique relates to his theme of oneness.  Certainly on the first viewing  one will probably not be able to follow all of the plot, but that makes the  film watchable and intriguing repeatedly as the beauty and complexity of  the individual stories become more clear.Even without interesting  characters The Thin Red Line would be remarkable for its gorgeous,  gorgeous, cinematography.  Though the DVD will never be able to recreate  the awesome experience of screening the film in a theater the transfer is  excellent with rich and full colors.  Possibly even worth buying a 75&quot;  HDTV just to see the film in all of its glory.In summation, The Thin  Red Line is a film to watch again and again.  I think the more times one  sees the more complex and ineffable the film becomes.

524884,"KEEPING THE FAITH is a fine example of how extra features on a DVD can help change your mind about a film.  When I first saw it, my immediate reaction was total disappointment.  It's not that I thought the film bad, exactly.  It was just that the previews had made it out to be a hilarious romantic comedy, and it wasn't exactly splittin' my sides.When you look at the deleted scenes and hear the audio commentary, it becomes clear that producer/director Ed Norton wasn't trying to make the film the studio was selling.  It's not that he comes out and says, ""Disney's marketing department screwed me."" But you see through his dialogue with his writer that he made conscious choices away from extremely funny material.  He wasn't trying to make a hilarious movie, just a good story about three friends.This is particularly evident when viewing the deleted scenes.  Though completely shot and scored, Norton decides to axe what is clearly the funniest orgasm scene since Meg Ryan faked it in a restaurant.  You also see how much of Ben Stiller's naturally funnier self was edited out.  Why?  Norton says, to the audible chagrin of his writer, that it didn't really fit in the movie he was trying to make.Whether you agree with him on this and other choices, the fact is that if the movie he was trying to make had been marketed, it would've garnered more appreciation.Still, Norton didn't quite succeed at making a solid romance, either.  It's not the kind of movie you'll watch over and over again.  After the engaging set up, there aren't really any plot twists, much less unexpected outcomes.  It's just another romance set in New York.  Lacking either remarkable comedy or profound insight, the film easily releases you from its grasp once you see it.  Norton has traded the innovative promise of the plot for mere likability.  I think, perhaps, that Norton was trying so hard not to cause religious offense that he winds up seeming almost gun shy of his own subject matter.  Or maybe the sudden rewrite of a huge chunk of the movie days prior to filming is what tripped things up.What I really think sinks the film, though, is Norton's own character.  He's just not a plausible romantic presence.  At no point do you ever feel like Brian might actually GET Anna, so his entire presence is superflous to the romantic plot.  Worse, the storyline depends on him going beyond being hurt by Anna's inevitable rejection, into the area of absolutely unprofessional conduct.  It just doesn't make any sense what he does in the end, and yet without his action, the story can't advance.All this aside, students of film will want to look at the DVD version of this movie, just because it's a great case study of the indirect tension between studio and filmmaker, and, to a lesser extent, between director and writer.

There is no need to adjust anything on your television to view  this DVD/video, as you will only be wasting your time, after, of course,  your money.I'd also like to take an opportunity to thank Rhino for  another wasted 3-D video release, &quot;ROBOT MONSTER&quot;.

About every five years an Oscar goes to someone involved in his latest film, and this is one so honored.

305540,"I know this review will earn me boos, hisses, and &quot;not helpful&quot; votes, but my wife and I (both lovers of old movies) watched this a few nights back and frankly, we were baffled.  Howard Hawks has made his share  of movies with &quot;men's men&quot;, but these characters are the most  opaque and wooden I've ever seen!  They are air-freight pilots delivering  to the treacherous Andes mountain area, led by the normally charming (or at  least interesting) Cary Grant.  When the first pilot takes to air in the  film (Noah Beery, I believe), you can hear in the inflection of his voice  over the intercom that he seems resigned to his fate--the fog's closing in,  and he's doomed to crash.  Indeed he does, as do a number of the other  pilots that follow in the film.  The job doesn't seem to have any merits  above its risks, and Jules Furthman's turgid script doesn't give us any  hint as to why these men would risk their lives doing this job.  It's  implicit that flying IS their life, and there's this hunger that is  satisfied only through this activity.  But it's a tenet of the movie and a  credo of the men that nothing needs to be explained, it's a man thing, and  one just needs to move on.  So what we get for &quot;entertainment&quot;  almost borders on parody, as mission after mission goes awry, and the  tight-lipped toughies muddle through.  For romantic interest, there's Jean  Arthur as an itinerant showgirl who almost immediately falls in love with  Grant, though he &quot;wouldn't force a girl to do anything she didn't want  to&quot; and no woman has been able to cope with the stress of living that  close to death (though, in the film, Grant never actually gets up in a  plane); there's also Rita Hayworth, one of his exes, who's now with  McPherson (Richard Barthelmess), a pilot who bailed and let his partner die  in a previous air accident.  He of course, gets to redeem himself, and at  the end gets to nurse a beer with the guys, cradling it in his burnt and  bandaged hands.  Hayworth also tries to seduce Grant, to no avail.  Eventually the girls fall into line (acting appropriately stoic), and  Arthur decides to hang around after Grant, in his typical off-handed way  lets her know he loves her (via a two-headed coin)--but he loves flying  more.  I couldn't fathom this movie or this closed society; the story is  slow and repetitive and the actors have been directed to suppress every bit  of charm or life they have within them (you can see it trying to escape  from Jean Arthur)--it's all very morose, banal and a trial to sit through.  As a rule, I don't give one-star reviews--but I can honestly say I hated  this movie.",Only Angels Have Wings VHS
204232,"Clift and especially de Havilland's performances in this film have been much touted, and they have strong merits. However, the performances to watch this movie for are really those of Ralph Richardson and Miriam Hopkins. Wyler's direction is tightly controlled and de Havilland sometimes appears over-directed.Clift, on the other hand, seems under-directed, free, and is constantly startling. A bit out of place, at times a little off the mark, but very, very surprising...and very, very original. It is worth watching his early films (like Red River, The Heiress, I Confess and Indiscretion of an American Wife) to fully absorb the novelty of what he brought to the screen. His instincts, though not always dramatically of a piece, are nevertheless so unexpected that they may make him a real joy to watch on screen.The Copland score adds much to the film, and the scene in which Clift plays 'Plaisir d'Amour' to de Havilland and then walks over to her while she draws back (cowers?) on her sofa is very, very special. It fully represents the artistry of the cast and crew involved in making this film.The ending is remarkable. The story and characters are justly famous for their representation of the shyness of the character and her relationship with her family. It is to the credit of this film, that inspite of all it has in place to distract from the story and characters, they are what remain in the mind long after you are done watching the film.

English is not his  first language and he looks lost, the director needed to work harder to get  more emotion from him.  Or perhaps that is how they decided to play his  character, strong, silent and unimaginatively like in alot of other action  films.

384085,"&quot;Thunderball&quot; is the fourth entry of the James Bond series and in terms of box office was the most successful Bond film of the 1960's. Coming fresh off the heels the very successful &quot;Goldfinger&quot;,  producers Cubby Broccoli and Harry Saltzman, armed with their largest  budget to date, set out to produce a blockbuster film, filmed for the first  time in a widescreen format. The advertising blitz for Thunderball helped  produce an air of great anticipation among the moviegoing public.  Thunderball did not disappoint them.Ironically, Thunderball was  originally intended to be the story of the first James Bond film but  problems negotiating with Keven McCrory, who owned the film rights to  Thunderball, force the producers to use &quot;Dr. No&quot; instead. It is  perhaps it was all for the best that things turned out the way they did.  With Sean Connery back again as James Bond and Terence Young returning the  director's chair after skipping &quot;Goldfinger&quot; as well as writer  Richard Maibalm, Thunderball was able to capture James Bond at his peak.  The cast of supporting character also returned with Bernard Lee as  &quot;M&quot;, Lois Maxwell as Miss MoneyPenny, and Desmond Llewelyn as  &quot;Q&quot;. The character of CIA agent Felix Leiter also returned though  played by yet a different actor, Rik Van Nutter.In Thunderball, that  evil organization SPECTRE is back and this time, it is playing for the  highest stakes. Its number two agent, Emilio Largo (played by Aldolfo Celi)  plans to steal two atomic bombs from NATO and hold Britain hostage for 100  million pounds sterling. Aided by the beautiful but lethal Fiona Volpe  (played by Luciana Paluzzi), Largo succeeds in obtaining the bombs. James  Bond, following a hunch, succeeds in meeting Largo in the Bahamas through  his mistress, the lovely Domino (played by Claudine Auger). Can Bond locate  the bombs before time runs out?The large budget for Thunderball allowed  the production team to stage and film James Bond's latest adventure in the  most lavish manner. The use of widescreen cameras made many of the scenes  filmed at Pinewood Studios, M's conference room for example, appear larger  than life. Thunderball also pioneered a number of underwater photography  techniques, which paid off when filming the underwater battle royale. In  fact, Thunderball is best seen in its widescreen format as the standard TV  format shows less than half the frame.But just as important as the  production values were the performances and the chemistry of the cast.  Aldolfo Celi's portrayal of Largo is superb and the banter between Connery  and Luciana Paluzzi is both suspenseful and amusing. There is plenty of  action, too starting with the fight in the opening sequence, to the  underwater battle, and the hydrofoil racing out of control.Thunderball  is considered by many Bond fans, including this one, as Sean Connery's tour  de force as the sauve secret agent. Though Connery starred in two more Bond  films for Broccoli and Saltzman, these films never seem to click with  audiences as well as this one did when it was released in 1965. If one had  to choose only one Bond film of the 1960's keep in one's film collection,  Thunderball would be an excellent choice.",Thunderball VHS

At the same time look past the action  and you will see and feel the love and the loss in this.

305920,"This tape comprises the first two episodes of the brilliant British series. Loosely based as science fiction due to its setting in the future, this is primarily a drama series based in fact, dealing with human rights  abuses that unhappily occur in our present. In an unspecified time  (although not too far in the future), Earth is run by a totalitarian  Federation - dissidents are murdered or sent to penal colonies and the  populace is drugged into a state of subservient apathy. Into this scenario  enters Roj Blake, a seemingly unassuming man. Blake is asked by a friend to  join a meeting of rebels; this he does, with fateful consequences. The  first episode, &quot;The Way Back&quot; is the best to authentically  capture the Orwellian atmosphere the series is based on. The sterile, white  corridors of the domed city; the ruthless and murderous black suited  security patrols; the psycho-manipulators - they all depict perfectly this  depressing possibility of the future. Blake's nightmarish journey as he  rediscovers his repressed past is harrowing - his mental breakdown,  complete with horrific and violent flashbacks, is a disturbing indicator of  what this regime is capable of. The second episode, &quot;Space Fall&quot;,  deals with the formation of the group that will become Blake's crew. Of  particular interest is the introduction of Kerr Avon, the cynical would-be  computer fraudster, who will become the series' most interesting character.  One of the down sides to &quot;Blake's 7&quot; is that the introduction is  very slow - it continues over the next two episodes. A casual viewer may be  put off by this, despite the importance of understanding the background and  motivation of the characters in the later stories. In short, essential for  the sake of continuity, but very heavygoing. But perserverance will reward  the new viewer.","Blake's 7, Vol. 01 - The Way Back / Space Fall VHS"

What a delight to experience the magic of this performance on DVD! While opera, in general, is not noted for high quality acting, the performances of Judith Blegen (Gretel) and Frderica von Stade ( Hansel), who never seems to be other than visually and sonically lovely, are simply captivating! Blegen's soprano is lyric, light and smooth, and is perfectly matched by von Sade's mezzo.

It was always on in my house think of it  as a communal fireplace. I had no real direction in life other than I felt  the need to be entertained. Fight club also takles the fact that men have  been feminized over the years. Men in are current climate are seen mostly  as sperm donors rather than people. Their masculine agressive instincts are  seen as a negative. So take an T.V overdosed male, place him in an eight by  eight cubicle after college in a stressful job. How does that person cope.  Fight club faces these issues by showing extremes. It offers no outcomes  only the problems. Which I feel is a flaw of the film. To those who dislike  the movie I say this. Should we really turn a blind eye to the ugliness  that sometimes surfaces in life? I feel we should think about them to try  to solutions on an individual level. Which is what I feel this movie was  about. Raising an issue to provoke thought. Also Fight Club does not  promote anarchy.",N/A
157705,"Pedro Almodovar's &quot;Live Flesh&quot; is a film noir full of style,  exhilaration, richness and excellent erotic storytelling. Almodovar, the  best director from Spain since the great Luis Bunuel, shows here a  complexity in filmmaking few directors achieve. His screenplay here is  exquisitly detailed in story and situations. The story by itself keeps us  gripped and interested. The way the story unfolds has a lot of energy and  Almodovar surprises us with revelations at every corner.

Following her Oscar-winning turn in Mike Nichols' ground-breaking drama  &quot;Who's Afraid Of Virginia Woolf?&quot;, this is the gifted Sandy  Dennis' finest hour on screen. As the demented heroine, Dennis makes you  feel your way into her character's dark and ultimately disturbing world.  It's a blissful, strikingly effective performance, and watching it one  might wonder why Dennis didn't win a second Oscar.

475950,"Like the bulk of those out there I patiently awaited the next installment to the Star Wars Universe ever since I first learned that there were going to possibly be additional films to the original Episodes 4, 5 &amp; 6 (I think I learned about this sometime between the release of 'Empire' and 'Jedi').  I wasn't a fanatic who waited in line for days or even weeks like some, but I WAS fortunate enough to see it the day before release and as I sat through it, I couldn't help but wonder: 'What is WRONG with the critics?!  I LOVE this movie!'  I really DID.  I think the MAJOR problem that most people had with Episode I was after having waited for so long, many had come up with their OWN ideas of HOW the movie should go, so much so that by the time the movie came out there was NOTHING that could have possibly made them satisfied.With that said, I DID however find one very MAJOR and GLARING error with Episode I:  From the earlier movies we discover that Obi Wan was trained as a Jedi BY YODA but for some odd reason George Lucas has decided to alter this established course by having Obi Wan trained by Qui Gon Jin.  Now while I enjoyed the character played by Liam Neeson (one of my favorite parts of the entire movie, in fact) I found that deep down I just could not find it in my heart to forgive Lucas for taking such a HUGE departure from his OWN story!  Now that being a small (but significant) complaint, I still found the movie visually stunning (how could it NOT be?) but I also feel deep down that the starships of the original trilogy were way more cool than the ones featured in Episode I (did anyone else notice that Princess Amidala's ship looked suspiciously like a silver suped-up version of the SR-71 spy plane?).  I am finding myself anxiously waiting for Episode II (due the latter part of May 2002) and I don't CARE what Lucas has in store for us, I am just excited to SEE it.",N/A
481114,"As with almost every archival Beatles-related release, this is another product that tries to straddle the line of being for the collector and the casual fan both (leaving neither really happy with the end result). Once again they have erred on the favor of the casual fan, who will not be the  one buying the majority of this release. Capitol/EMI never seem to learn  from the great bootlegs how to compile really good releases.If you have  Imagine (the videos film), and Imagine (the documentary film), and Yoko Ono  Then and Now, and the John Lennon videos collection, then you already have  more of THIS video than you SHOULD have. The NEW stuff in this video is  GREAT! Where is the rest of it? I could have gone for way more recording  scenes, this hardly shows George playing, no King Curtis, no Badfinger.  Just enough to tease us, then back to more recycled footage. Obviously  these people filmed everything they did almost all the time, so why do we  have to keep seeing the same scenes over and over again in each (NEW?)  product. I am all for putting things in context, but the old stuff makes  the basis for this dvd, not the new stuff. Just enough is left out of each  product that you have to buy all of them, but once you have them it's  pretty redundant. Of course the casual fan is not going to care because  they will only see one of the versions, but for the rest of us this is  getting really old. They also took the cheap way out and left in all the  dust, hairs, scratches, and streaks in the video too, rather than cleaning  it up like Yellow Sub. And, unlike Yellow Sub, the 5.1 soundtrack is not  that big of a deal musically, and not that sonically different from the cd  remaster.The extra interview is nice, since they went out of their way  to make that complete. I just wish as much thought would have gone into the  main feature. Do you need this? Yes. If it's the only Lennon video you  have, you'll probably be pretty happy, and it's much better than the videos  version Imagine. If you have all the others, you still need this because  there is just enough new to re-sell you the old again.","Gimme Some Truth - The Making of John Lennon's ""Imagine"""
165953,"Okay, so I'm neither a man nor a weather-forecaster.  Still, the first time I saw this movie back in the 80's, I knew it was about my life.  Back in those days, I couldn't understand why nothing was going the way I  thought it should, no matter how hard I tried to bend and twist my will and  that of others to fit my plan. Ah, the ego - it is a marvelous  misconception.Our hero, Phil Connor (Bill Murray), has enough ego to  choke - well, certainly to choke any interest the lovely Andie MacDowell  might have in him when they end up trapped in a small town in the middle of  a blizzard, on GroundHog Day.For her, it's a one day event. Heck, for  everyone but Phil, it's a one day event.  But Phil - well, Phil wakes up  again and again to the sound of &quot;I've Got You Babe&quot; - same day,  same people and the only way things change is when Phil's behavior changes.Unfortunately for Phil, but fortunately for those of us watching this  movie, it takes him several wake-up calls before he gets it.  I've tried  figuring out how many years these repeated days add up to - but I can't and  it doesn't really matter.Some of us learn slowly, and when we are in  the midst of 'getting it', this movie is a comfort.  We're not the only  ones! There's hope!An under-appreciated movie, and Bill Murray is the  perfect star.  He manages to be obnoxious and unlikeable in the beginning,  and even if you don't like his style much (I really am not a Bill Murray  fan), you end up liking the guy in the end.

20031,"Despite having a fantastic cast and spot-on wardrobe, set decoration and cinematography, THE END OF THE AFFAIR flounders because it tries so hard to be a morality play, it forgets to give us interesting characters.  Each of  the three leads is locked by their respective world views into senses of  propriety that largely prevent them from communicating.  They all believe  they are acting in the right way, according to their own system of beliefs,  and so feel no need to explain their actions.  Consequently, very little  actually *happens* in the film.  It is a film ultimately about reactions.  And that's fine stuff for a novel, like the Graham Greene basis for the  screenplay, but it hardly makes for a satisfying night at the movies.It's made particularly unsatisfying because we're never really  introduced to the characters.  We don't know why Julianne Moore's character  married Stephen Rae's.  And we need to know. There's certainly nothing in  the present of their relationship which explains why they would have  married.  They seem to have nothing in common, and Stephen Rea acts so  completely joyless throughout, it's hard to see why they'd even be good  friends.  We likewise don't see the root of Ralph Fiennes' atheism, nor  indeed Julianne Moore's Christianity.To be sure, this is somewhat  faithful to the novel, which has all events transpiring before the eyes of  Fiennes' character, who doubles as the story's narrator.  Given that, it  makes sense that there would be a certain incompleteness of vision about  the other characters.  But the dearth of exposition in this film is far  more than can be explained by narrative perspective.  It's simply missing,  and there's no good  reason for that.Without that vital character  background, we don't care about them--and we're certainly unimpressed by  the moral their story aims to teach.  In fact, the groundwork laid for that  conclusion is so sparse, and the conclusion itself so controversial, that  we're left feeling as if the filmmakers have committed a form of gratuitous  blasphemy.(DVD NOTES: This product has an above average collection of  extras, including two audio commentaries, a making-of featurette and an  isolated music score.  The featurette is rather forgettable, but the audio  commentaries are significant and interesting-more engrossing than the film  itself.IMPORTANT NOTE:  There's a double-feature version of this product  that has both the original film and this remake on it.  It's more  expensive, but worth it.)",N/A

484613,"This is one of those movies that I found prfoundly disappointing because it had the potential to be one of the greatest of the American Sci-Fi films and it blew it.The movie is great in that there is an attempt to respect  the laws of physics and mechanics. So, an astronaut is lost because he  approaches a derilict spacecraft at too high a velocity to hold on.  The  others can't rescue him due to lack of fuel, and the lengthy startup  procedure for the spaceship.  I couldn't help thinking that in another  movie there would have been 15 minutes of death-defying stunts and whizzing  spaceships to rescue the astronaut.  I also thought that the ship used to  fly to Mars was very realistically designed.The problem with the movie  is the requirement to basically watch a 15 minute home-movie before the  action begins, more home-movies in the spacecraft headed to Mars, and  finally an extra-terresrial at the end that looks like it belongs in a B  grade Sci-Fi flick of the 50's.

511883,"Actually, the many loves, and types of love, contained in this little film are quite 'ordinary' and happen every day. They just don't usually make it to the big, or little, screen. We have a guy who owns a house. He can't  come out because his mother fantasizes that he will get married one day. He  rents rooms to a female in a rock band (with whom he, and just about  everyone else, has an affair; a dead guy; a narcissistic (and justifiably  so) actor who likes it both ways; a cute little Asian boy; and an  over-weight bank teller. The movie must be viewed as a self-contained soap  opera, considering the myriad twists of plot and sub-plot, which involves  the usual betrayal, bank robbery, adultery, and murder. The nicest facet of  the story is the developing romance between Vince (the Asian boy) and his  'straight' hispanic neighbor, Ramon -- who is also the son of an abusive  father (upon whom his mother is cheating with Andy, the narcissistic  actor!). The only two who have any integrity in the film are Ramon and  Vince, and they are amply rewarded at the end. Probably only deserves three  stars, but the people are cute enough to bump it up to four. And it's just  nice to see a film where there is a natural variety of sexual preference.

482310,"The most terrifying scream is always the last one, or so ""Scream 3""proclaims. Surprisingly enough though, the ending to Kevin Williamson's clever trilogy doesn't let viewers down-- even without Williamson scripting  the final chapter.  From the opening scene fans of ""Scream"" and ""Scream  2"" will be shocked and pleasantly surprised at who lives and who dies. And  although the ending is your typical cheesy horror film conclusion, it fits  ""Scream"" perfectly. After all, this wasn't just any old horror franchise.  This horror series cleverly made fun of its own genre and trilogies while  scripting together an engaging and intriguing plotline that kept viewers  guessing to, appropriately enough, the very last scream. Written by Ehren  Kruger, ""Scream 3"" is the perfect ending to the horror franchise that  brought back scary movies in the `90s. Clever, funny and suspenseful,  ""Scream 3"" leaves the rules that ex-Scream star Jamie Kennedy clued viewers  in on in the original ""Scream"" at the door.  Neve Campbell, David  Arquette, and Courtney Cox-Arquette return for the final chapter of the  ""Scream"" series, but this film is Arquette and Cox-Arquette's alone. While  viewers should care about Campbell's character and whether or not she  lives, viewers will be cheering for the ruthless TV reporter Gail Weathers  and the dopey Deputy Dewey the whole time. Hopeless romantics will also get  caught up in whether or not the two on-again off-again, real-life duo will  end up happily ever after like they did in real life.  As though the  film wasn't great enough in the theater, the DVD just adds to the whole  ""Scream"" experience, giving away not only the alternate trilogy ending, but  also giving fans a chance to see deleted scenes and out-takes from all  three ""Scream"" films.

The concert scene at Albert Hall in London was very reminiscent of Hitchcock's ""The Man Who Knew Too Much.""

524140,"Yes, this is your basic, high concept, &quot;Aliens&quot;-on-a-planet-in-total-darkness, survival of the cutest, sci-fi terror film. With that as a template, the real question is: does it deliver the goods? I say yes.The plot is simple: A space ship crashes on a desert planet and the only survivors are an eclectic mix of characters who must somehow survive the perils of this planet to get to a ship that can get them off the planet. The trick is that this planet is about to go into a long total eclipse and there are these carnivorous beasts who only come out in &quot;pitch black&quot; that will eat everybody if they don't find away to work together and survive. The characters include a rookie pilot, a cop with a problem, some Islamic pilgrims, a couple of kids, an effete English rich guy, an Australian tracker, and a psycho killer.What happens and whether anyone lives or dies is pretty obvious to anyone who has seen at least one of these types of movies before, up until the very end. There are a few twists, a red herring or two, a couple of mysteries to be solved, and some secrets are revealed as the film progresses, but they all make sense for the drama of the story. At the last moment, however, I was actually not sure which way the movie was going to go. The filmmaker has the opportunity to make a statement about humanity (something about duty, redemption, and forgiveness), and the way the story ends makes that statement.The special effects are good and convincing. The production design effectively communicates the appropriate moods, from heat and desolation to darkness and claustrophobia. There is even an effect on the film that gives certain scenes a real &quot;other-worldly&quot; feel.At the end of it all, I felt like I had a quality cinematic experience, but something was lacking. The film seemed a little short, and the darkness of it was maybe a little one-dimentional. There was enough variety, enough thrills and chills, enough drama for this particular movie, but I did want something more to go with it. Something lighter, more humorous, maybe, but still in the sci-fi genre. Then I went and saw &quot;Galaxy Quest&quot; (which I have already reviewed). Yes! That's it! &quot;Pitch Black&quot; and Galaxy Quest,&quot; in that order, with a cartoon, serial, and newsreel, and we've got a perfect science fiction double feature! Break out the popcorn!",N/A

132418,"A lot of people had trouble finding the core of this movie, thus blaming  it for being too unfocused.  The main character in this movie is New York  City of the Nineties.  More specifically, it's an anti-Giuliani picture.  In this movie, Scorcese argues convincingly that the notorious qualities of  the &quot;old New York' still very much exist today.  The Giuliani  administration and large corporation(read Disney and Gap) has put  considerable effort in sweeping the underbelly of New York under a rug.  After seeing the movie, I could not look at my favorite city the same way.  I saw what the city's been trying to hide for the past few years more  clearly, even in the &quot;New Times Square&quot;.  If that doesn't  convince you, look at the statistics, the gap between the rich and the poor  grew dramatically, the percentage living below the poverty line rose, and  the number of homeless pretty much stayed the same.  Everything in this  movie conveys this message.Cage here embodies the psyche of someone  who is obviously frustrated and worn down by this disparity between the  real New York and the spin-driven hyped-up image of the new NYC.  Like in  Birdy and Leaving Las Vegas, Cage shows that his versatility is only  surpassed by the likes of Brando, Duval, De Niro, etc.  The rest of the  cast is stupendous.  The transfer is absolutely stunning, doing complete  justice to the gorgeous work that we've come to expect from Scorcese and  Richardson.",N/A

Instead  of the Hollywood happy ending, we have a dark and grim tale of family  morals and the loyalty between being a stand up guy and a family man.

The cast is excellent with Colm Meaney as  a remorseless crime boss, Ian Hart as Bobby's energetic friend, Famke  Janssen as Bobby's girlfriend, and the rest of the cast are in top form.

Unlike Jaws and Jaws 2 this movie has the dead people on the screen for a  fairly long period of time. After I saw it I was really embarrassed for the  director, Joe Alves. The acting was alright, it was just the photography,  the plot and the lack of the Jaws theme song (it was only used once) that  made the movie so bad.

Simon Templar, &quot;The Saint,&quot; was one of the latter. There never was much to Templar to begin with; he was just a debonair smart aleck in the tradition of Philo Vance and Bulldog Drummond. But surely even a fourth-rate cardboard character deserves more than this: being turned into a vehicle for Val Kilmer's apparently limitless self-indulgence. The film is actually a Kilmer anthology - donning about a dozen so-called disguises, he never gets around to acting the part of Templar, but he does run through all the trademark Val characters (smoldering lounge lizard, buck-toothed comic, stoic tough guy). We're supposed to care because he doesn't know how to be HIMSELF, but in fact we're grateful for small favors. The movie is also memorable for a second awful performance -- by Elisabeth Shue, who appears visibly frustrated and puzzled over how to play scenes with her bizarre co-star.",The Saint VHS

First, the story is serious and dark, but filled with  built-in action set pieces that mostly  (except for the parachute snowmobiles) fit right in and don't seem too  contrived. I was especially imressed that the finale wasn't a routine  shootout in the villian's secret fortress.  Second, the villians are  tragic and developed rather than the usual egomaniacal billionaire. They  are carefully written and add much to the depth of the film.  Third, there  are several supporting roles that are well-played and written, especially  Dame Judy Dench as M. The plucky Christmas Jones character is fun, and adds  a nice contrast to the silky Electra King.  Do I need to mention that  Pierce Brosnan is an excellent Bond? He really embodies Bond's  essence-sauve, sexy, and very dangerous.  Finally, the film is  beautifully shot and directed. Too many of the 70's and 80's Bonds looked  they were directed by committee.

This  parody of a 70's/80's rock band feels so absurd and realistic that members  of Aerosmith credit it with causing their epiphany that forced them to get  clean -- when the saw it they realized, even if it wasn't a direct parody  of them, it was close enough.Also, when they stopped selling the  original release of the DVD and VHS, it became the most 'stolen' rental  movie -- people would just take it out and eat the 'lost' fee.",This Is Spinal Tap

48696,"VERTIGO is one of my personal favorite film of all time, and if I write to praise this emotinally- filled obsessive love story, I just won't be able to stop. But following the lesson from the great Hitchcock himself, less is more.What I'd rather like to critisise is the &quot;restoration&quot; that was the basis of this DVD. Now it's true that VERTIGO has never looked as beautiful as this for the last doezen years or so before Harris and Katz restored and re-release it. The re-release print of the mid eighties was so poor in quality. So in that sense, you should buy this DVD because it is the best version available so far--for most of the audience.But this so-called &quot;restoration&quot; is controversial, and has a lot of problems. I must say that the best available version of the film is still the TECHNICOLOR-IB prints from the 50's and 60's, because IB prints don't fade in colors and there are still some prints available.Harris and Katz did the best they could to capture the colors, the visual beauty of the film, using the original negative, and their version basically looks fine, except for the very dark scene (such as the tower of San Juan Batista at the end). Now, as they and the film's associate producer Herbie Coleman points out on the commentary track, they restored the correct darkness, but not the contrast, which they should have enhanced to simulate the original TECHNICOLOR look in which the shadows are really black but at the same time keeping the details. On an IB-TECHNICOLOR prints, the faces of Jimmy Stuart and Kim Novak really pop out of the darkness, allowing the audience to understand the incridible dramatic conflict of the scene....but on the &quot;restoration&quot;, you see vertually nothing except the darkness.The biggest problem is the sound. In order to create a digital DTS sound track, they removed all the original sound effects, and replaced with new effects created on folleys. They must have done the best they could, but still those new sound effects are so annoying, and it destroys the atmosphere and emotions of the film. They just sound noisy. The original version of the film had a soundtrack which is much more subtle, which creates a beautiful dreamy, moody atmosphere totally in the spirit of the film. Bernard Herrmann's beautiful music (probably the best music ever written for a film) suffers a lot because of that, which is a real pitty.Since the DVD format allows to have many different sound tracks, it would have been nice if they could keep the original monaural sound as an additional track. Then those who are in favor of the more &quot;modern&quot; digital sound can have their fun, while those who has a deeper, true understanding of the film could fully enjoy Hitchcock's masterpiece, truly in its original form (Hitchcock had never intended to make this film in stereo anyway).I am very afraid that from now on, people will missunderstand that this is the standard version of VERTIGO. It simply is not. It is a much much much more beautiful film",N/A
397890,"Elegant soirees, fashion shoots, strolls about Paris, romance, witty dialogue - this movie has it all.  An amazingly strong cast graces this light-hearted romantic comedy that also has a wonderful soundtrack.  The  music truly adds another sweeping dimension to the film.  Julia Ormond is  stunning yet sweet as Sabrina, and her transformation from the dowdy,  lovelorn adolescent to glamorous sophisticate was very well done.  Her  quiet, smooth voice opens the movie and flows over tranquil scenes of the  luxurious Larrabee estate, Harrison Ford is the stoic Linus Larrabee the  cold, sharp businessman (&quot;the world's only living heart-donor&quot;)  who learns to love under the gentle guidance of a mature and wise Sabrina.  Greg Kinnear is an extremely likable David, the younger son.  Nancy  Marchand is a hoot as Maude, the matriarch, who dons some rather elaborate  evening gowns!  John Wood is a most distinguished chauffeur, and audiences  will respect him more than the original.  Even Mac, the loyal, ever so  efficient secretary, has some great one-liners.The original made me  squirm with Hepburn's portrayal of an embarrassingly  immature, unbalanced  Sabrina.  The remake stresses her psychological maturing (&quot;I found  myself in Paris&quot;) in addition to the physical makeover.  More  importantly, Bogart and Hepburn didn't give me the same thrill that Ford  and Ormond do.  I think they really enjoyed making this movie together -  their shared smiles and laughter on Martha's Vineyard and in the Moroccan  restaurant seemed genuine.  It's more than good acting.  I know several  will disagree with me, but even those who prefer the original have to admit  that the scenes in Paris, beautifully shot on location, are a vast  improvement to the old version.  This movie is one of my favorites, and I'm  glad others see the merit in this remake and aren't dismissing it as  readily as the critics did.",Sabrina VHS

In fact, &quot;House Of Usher&quot; is not only a  straight thriller, it is also a very poetic movie, it has a good script, a  haunting score (especially in the crypt sequence) and a very well crafted  set design (just watch Corman`s opulent use of colors). If the climax is  somewhat hurried it is more than made up by the frightening atmosphere of  the film. When I watched it as a child in the early eighties, it was one of  the few old chillers that really scared me to death ..... and it will  certainly entertain everyone who enjoys to watch really good vintage horror  thrillers (Vincent Price`s morbid characterization of Roderick Usher is  worth a few shocks alone).",N/A

With instruments and forms of music virtually  unaffected by 40 years of pop culture, these superlative musicians will  warm you with their humility and their affection for each other and their  culture, and then thrill you will their rich music.  Cooder, however, did  the musicians a disservice by giving himself and his son such a big  role  in the project.  Cooder's electric guitar doesn't work when it is mixed  with thick, natural sound of the Cuban musicians.  Director Win Wenders  shot a brilliant sequence when legendary pianist Ruben Gonzalez is working  magic on his piano and Cooder interjects with his electric guitar.  Wenders  moves the camera amongst the Cuban musicians while Cooder is playing and  they all have perplexed looks on their faces.  It is a sound that they  obviously are not accustomed to and one that clashes with their natural  sounds.  It's also painful to watch Cooder's son head and shoulder  movements while he plays percussion -- it's something straight out of a  Wayans brother movie.I don't want to seem ungrateful.  Full credit goes  to Cooder for what he has done for these performers and the music world.  These performers obviously have deep affection for Cooder.

Martin Sheen arrives on the island, with strict  orders in hand that the monks obey the Vatican, no questions asked.  How  the monks dramatize their grievances against the Holy See is not, however,  the true climax of the film.

Sheen wonders  why he hasn't requested a transfer or retirement.  Howard tells him how  important he and the other monks are to the islanders, and that their  community work is more important than his inability to pray.  By the close  of the film, with Sheen exiting in his Helicopter as all the monks are  gathered below, buffetted by the wake of the propeller blades, the very  real and moving drama of one man's crisis of faith, made all the more  moving by Trevor Howard, becomes painfully real for us.",The Conflict

Cut next to the Father, who announces that he will be dead a year from now  -- he intones this while doing something unmentionable  (on Amazon)  in the  shower.  Flashy enough for you?

Not only  does this cheap trick waste time, it's dishonest:  why can't we see what  the Spacey character is REALLY thinking about?

Although it might be self-contradictory in that it &quot;adds to  the problem&quot;, as well as Stone's belonging to the media, which was the  film's sole source of attack, &quot;Natural Born Killers&quot; had a  positive influence on me.  It shocked me not merely for it's violence,  which is very extreme, but because of how little people notice how deeply  they are interested in it.  My original intention for renting &quot;Natural  Born Killers&quot; was to see how violent it really was.

For one thing, there's not much difference from the tape  set and the DVD, with the exceptions of a 5.1 soundtrack, audio commentary,  and a Nine Inch Nails music video that is missing on the DVD, but is  included on the tape.  The biggest drawback is that the DVD is not  anamorphically enhanced.  For a brand new DVD, anamorphic enhancement  should be a must.  The transfer is derived from the letterboxed edition  used to make the laserdisc and the tape, which has some faults in it.

Though I must say that some of the other acting was rather dry  to say the least. Mr. Prichett in particular was just plain irratating. On  the positive side, there is a catching story line (upright captain has to  fight his best friend in order to keep him from setting off a nuclear  bomb). The action is good. As I said, Travolta's acting is great;  practically carries the film. The final word, I really enjoyed it, but can  easilly see why most others wouldn't. I'd suggest renting it. You never  know, you may like it and choose to by it.",N/A

203858,"A highly successful technical experiment.  This was Hitchcock's first color film, shot on one set in (almost) one unbroken shot.  Pretty amazing when you consider that the cameras of that time were not nearly as portable as those of today.  The set had to be constructed with walls that were movable to accomodate the movements of the camera, and those movements had to be accomplished silently because the production used actual real-time sound.  Pay attention to the lighting as well; a panoramic cityscape was constructed for the set and the lighting technicians simulate a sunset as the action unfolds.The performers are outstanding as well, particularly James Stewart and John Dall.  Real tension is generated as the players confront and confound each other while Hitchcock's roving camera moves through the room, always alert for the telling detail.  Classic.",N/A

But it's not for the faint-of-heart or the easily offended. My fiancee I think would refuse to watch it because while the female lead is a strong character, she gets kind of manhandled at times which is unfortunate.

311788,"I thanked the man at Central Park who introduced &quot;84 Charing Cross Road&quot; to Anne Bancroft and Mel Brooks for help making it into a film. David Hugh Jones did a splendid directing.  Marvellous adaptation of Helene Hanff's book which I cherish. Without this film I may never find such a terrific book. Great contribution to books-lovers and movie-goers.I love this film.It's one of my all time favourite! Very literary unique with exquisite performances from Anne Bancroft and Anthony Hopkins.This bitter sweet true story is about lifelong letters correspondence between a struggling writer Helene Hanff(Bancroft) and a book dealer Frank Doel(Hopkins). It began when Helene, a New Yorker responded to an advertisement in the &quot;Saturday Review of Literature&quot;. She wanted to mail order out of prints or cheaper edition old books from a London book shop which Frank worked as a book dealer. The book shop was located in 84 Charing Cross Road. At first everything were strictly business like. Helene was always interested and amazed by English Literature and cultures and Frank vice-versa,intrigue by this American. Eventually,they developed a special friendship,an unspoken love and care for each other without even seeing each other. They were like soul mates and that was extraordinary.The cultural and social differences between London and New York during that period were vividly illustrated.  It's so touching to see Helene finally going to London.Her love for english literature was sincere and remarkable. This made the movie so unforgettable and great. Beacause all these actually did happened and those people really existed.Both Anne Bancroft and Anthony Hopkins were astonishing in their roles. Also with great supporting casts like Judi Dench and Maurice Denham.This movie taught me about books,the magic of literature,friendship and many more.It also showed there are many different kind of perpetual love and care. I'll always re-watch it because I find it's a classic which touch my heart and soul.",N/A

235456,"Although director Elia Kazan ultimately failed in this uneven if brilliant attempt to bring his best-selling semi-autobiographical novel to the  screen, it is a wonderful sociological portrait of a man driven to the edge  of madness and despair by what material and career success does to his  soul. Kirk Douglas is terrific as Eddie Anderson, the deeply conflicted  Greek-American second-generation crossover who buys into the pursuit of  American business success and now feels as though his talent and creativity  have been totally corrupted and squandered in pursuit of the bitch goddess  of success. He has it all, money, sex, and power, and all the toys and  accessories such material success means. But his life is increasingly ashes  in his mouth, a bitter, lonely, empty and unfulfilling existence that is  literally driving Eddie insane.We watch enraptured as he plunges  head-first into a disastrous mid-life crisis, spiraling dangerously down  the slippery slope toward madness and involuntary commitment, until slowly  and painfully he begins to figure out what is wrong and how to fix it,  although all this is obviously done at an amazingly hurtful and  angst-filled cost to himself and his loved ones. Deborah Kerr co-stars as  his loving but also self-concerned and controlling wife, and Faye Dunaway  turns in a compelling performance as the insightful and sarcastic love  interest who draws him out of his mid-life diversions and makes him see how  expensive his sell-out has been to the real Eddie underneath all the glitz  and glamour.They say this movie had it all in the can, but that somehow  author/producer/director Elia Kazan blew it all by cutting and editing it  terribly, leaving it disjointed and hard-to-follow. Even though this seems  to be true, the movie is uneven but still quite good, with a number of  intense and moving scenes with Douglas, Dunaway, Kerr and Richard Boone  that are among the best dramatic footage I have ever seen. Watch for the  scenes late in the film when Eddie tries to explain himself and his actions  to his wife, tryng to verbalize the very complicated reasons he simply  cannot work at the ad agency any more. Although she coaxs him into the  monologue, promising him she'll do &quot;ANYTHING, god-dammit!&quot; to  make him happy, in the end she is quite conflicted, as well, and as a  result totally misunderstands him, discounting his problems and conflicts  and not hearing his plaintive pleas because she really doesn't want to give  up their privileged lifestyle. He pours out his heart and needs, but she  isn't listening, reacting angrily instead to what she sees as his  selfishness even though she has begged him to be honest about what he  really wants.Such powerful scenes honestly and accurately document the  terrible failed attempts at critical communication that too often  characterize the destruction of life-long relationships and tragic divorce.  Richard Boone of the TV series &quot;Have Gun, Will Travel&quot;, an old  Douglas friend and associate, also turns in a wonderful performance as  Eddie's domineering and senile Greek-immigrant father, a once successful  rug-importer who torments Eddie because he wants Eddie to bankroll him for  another chance to control his own life. The way all this spins together was  the powerful driving stuff behind a best-selling novel. The movie isn't  quite as good, but it is still a wonderful, entertaining and powerful drama  eminently worth watching.",N/A

93402,"That day America lost charismatic leadership elected by the people in  favor of secret government. After WWII, we realized we could not ever be  caught unprepared for war in a nuclear age, so we continued on in a state  of ""cold"" war. JFK wanted to change this in the middle of the  ""Cold War""; bad timing for sure. All of those that quibble (look  the word up) about Stone's details or pronounce the ""LHO did it""  have never fired a weapon in U.S. military service, least of all a cruddy  Mannlicher-Carcano. Get one and just try manipulating the bolt fast enough  for 3 shots. Then try aiming and proper breathing/trigger control. Next,  watch the head of JFK react backwards from a frontal shot in Stone's  showing of the Zapruder film, proving a frontal shot from a second gunman.  Next ponder on the FACT that the next U.S. Government assasination  investigation concluded it WAS a conspiracy requiring 2 or more gunmen. The  official U.S. Government position is that there WAS A CONSPIRACY. The  Warren Commission misconclusion has been superseded. Now what are YOU going  to do about it?The point is the people of America have become cowards,  the secret government knows that it has to do all our dirty work because we  certainly will not do it. This is why they knew they could remove the  elected President by coup d'etat and get away with it, as they then  proceeded to kill RFK, MLK, Malcolm-X and George Wallace, don't forget they  shot Reagen, too---anyone who offered a shimmer of hope of ""being his  own man"" while in public office/position of visibility that could  awaken the lazy Gen-Me/X/Y generations.What died that day in Dallas was  the belief that a charismatic leader could inspire the populace of America  to get involved in our government. Since that time its been all ""down  hill"".  And who is to blame?We are.When we become more  intelligent as Stone's films can make us realize the nature of things, then  we can take a more active role in government without the secret caretakers  of this Republic getting alarmed and feel like they have to assassinate us.  It took a tremendous amount of courage for Oliver Stone to make this film,  and I salute everyone in the cast, too. The point of this film is to be a  charismatic THINKING leader in your own right and not let the ""bad  people scare you"" as Garrison tells his children.Stone shows why  the men who killed JFK were angry at him, and they have good reasons for  their wrong doing. Still makes it wrong, but ""good people"" can do  bad things. Look at Nazi Germany--we are not immune from mob or  group-think. You don't offer to disarm in the face of world communism. See  Stone's Nixon and this will be clear, too. However, the conspirators that  killed our charismatic leaders are wrong because America needs people of  charisma holding things together at every level, they alone can't do it  all. If they wanted JFK out of office, see to it that he was voted, not  SHOT out of office. What we have here today is a slow death of America at  many levels by a pervading lack of trust in the people in our government,  partially because we cannot seem to elect good people into office or if we  did, not have them shot out.The movie clearly poses the question of  whether we are going to continue as a nation based on just a war footing  run by others or are we going to stop being selfish consumerists content to  let others handle the pressing matters of the nation? Or will we like  Garrison/JFK seek and find the truth, dare to be different and spend our  lives doing things far more interesting like space colonization and make  that our nation's reason for existance? We need a competent  military-industrial complex or we will not survive as a nation, but we will  not survive long if we don't get an enlightened citizenry that is able to  understand the complexities of the world (not quibble in order to sit on  one's rear) and assume the responsibility of our nation without disarming  in the face of the external enemy. The internal enemies are tougher. I  think we know who they are. We have met the enemy and he is us.",JFK Director's Cut
404617,"This adventure, featuring council estates, city squallor and grim reality, demonstrates how the series had moved on in its 26 years.The gritty portrayal of Ace's home of Perrivale provides a good contrast to the  science-fantasy atmosphere of the Planet of the Cheetah People.  The  Ace/Doctor double-act is at its best here, there is are some superb pieces  of dialogue and dark undertones, and Anthony Ainley is at last playing an  alternative incarnation of the Master rather than a parody of Roger  Delgado's version.  The Master's sense of emotion and desperation in this  story provides a new angle on the character and makes it a shame this was  to be Ainley's last appearance in the series.The Cheetah people do,  admittedly, appear to be on the cheesy side, but they are saved by their  portrayal and some stunning camerawork.

402525,"Bunuel made this film after &quot;Belle du Jour,&quot; using Catherine Deneuve as the heroine for both films.  Whereas &quot;Belle du Jour&quot;  was a foretaste of the sophisticated, chic French movies he made in the  seventies, &quot;Tristana&quot; is in some ways a throwback to the rough,  psychologically disturbing Spanish movies he made in the fifties and  sixties.  Both modes have their advantages, but for depth of feeling and  psychological insight his Spanish films are clearly better.  (His French  films are more subtly satirical and international in scope, but he seems to  have put less of his personal obsessions in them than in the films made in  his native Spanish idiom.  Or, rather, in the French films the obsessions  now have the streamlined pedigree endowed upon them by the international  film community's recognition of the World's Greatest Spanish Director.)  Fernando Rey is the quintessential Spanish gentleman--a little bit of  brutishness mixed in with the refinement--but he also gets to suggest  emotional depths here (and in &quot;Viridiana&quot;) that he did not in his  other films with Bunuel where he seemed merely slyly charming and debonair.  His desperate passion for Deneuve's Tristana is the emotional center of  the film, despite the title's emphasis on the heroine.  Deneuve's beauty  is, of course, flawless and this suits Tristana's early stages when she's  sweet, innocent, naive.  But Deneuve's ice princess qualities prevent her  from growing into the passion for the young artist (Franco Nero) that  signal her growth as a woman.  Both Rey and Nero register their emotions in  a fierce animal way that is perhaps more purely Spanish (or Italian in  Nero's case) than Deneuve's rarefied French blood will allow.  She seems  too cold and refined for big emotions.  She's effective in the latter  scenes where the script calls for her to become a coldhearted perverse  witch, rudely dismissing a friendly greeting in the park in Toledo or  scandalously exposing herself to the deaf mute son of her servant.  But we  don't see the hatred for Rey eating away at her that would allow her to  have her final victory over him.  We don't see the rage of this young girl  toward the men who have let her down:  first Rey for bringing her as a  young girl into his household as his mistress, then Nero for allowing her  to experience passion but disappointing her by returning her to Rey when  she gets ill (she says to Nero, &quot;Lope [Rey] would never have done  that&quot;--i.e., he's too proud and by implication more of a man).  And  then rage at Rey again for being stuck with him as his mistress for the  rest of her years.  When she condescends to marry Rey for appearances'  sake, she cruelly laughs at his expectation that their union will be  consummated.  She's saying to him, &quot;You silly man.  I married you to  please a priest and to inherit your wealth; don't delude yourself that I  care about you.&quot;  The dramatic situation is fascinating and it's  somewhat frustrating that it's not entirely realized, largely due to  Deneuve's limitations as an actress.  Still, there have been few directors  other than Bunuel who could bring so much to the material without softening  it and sentimentalizing it.  His style here is the plain, non-fussy  technique that made him infamous (allegedly, he was once offered Fellini's  cinematographer but turned him down in favor of the pedestrian camera work  of a fellow Spaniard).  Bunuel's style is an affront on bourgeois  expectations of a rich mise-en-scene or a style that calls attention to its  own artistic, innovative qualities.  It can be slow going and even seem  boring in the beginning stages, but in the best of Bunuel--as in  &quot;Tristana&quot;--it can reward the patient viewer with psychological  revelations of a truth uncommonly encountered on the screen.",Tristana VHS

Get a kick out of Lorne Green as a heart attack victim being strapped in an office chair, lowered from the 50th floor to the 45th (or whatever it was).  People really do these things in real life.

For example, what could be more ironic than a  secret fraternity of doctors holding mystic, candle-lit initiation rituals  during which they swear to uphold the scientific method?

I can't imagine anyone regretting the purchase of this DVD.This disc's picture quality and sound demonstrate what ought to be  done, but usually isn't, to some of the older classic movies now appearing  on DVD. Sound has been remastered into full Dolby Digital. Picture quality  is so fine it's difficult to believe that this could have been better  experienced in the theater.The obvious companion piece to this is the  documentary of the making of the film by Coppola's wife, &quot;Hearts of  Darkness: A Filmmaker's Apocalypse&quot;. If you haven't seen that, you  need to. It's a fascinating piece even if you haven't seen Apocalypse  Now.There are a couple of goodies on the disc, including an alternate  stand-alone ending of the airstrike coming in on the Kurtz temple and some  excerpts from the original theatrical program, but this is nothing compared  to all the goodies you can get by watching Hearts of Darkness.Knowing  about all that extra information and some deleted scenes shown in Hearts of  Darkness, I wonder why some of that material (indeed, why not put the whole  documentary on the disc, or make it purchasable as a double set?) wasn't  included on this disc. For that reason, I refrain from a fifth  star.Quality of the movie itself and quality of the transfer to DVD are  surely five stars, however. Perfect.On a completely irrelevant side  note, it would be nice if Coppola pulled a George Lucas on this film and  rereleased it with some digital enhancements, such as the addition of the  extra choppers he wanted in the chopper attack scene and a redoing of some  of the awful artificial shadowing on Brando's face in the ending scenes.

510150,"THE STENDHAL SYNDROME[La Sindrome di Stendhal](Italy - 1995)Aspect ratio: 1.66:1Theatrical soundtrack: Dolby DigitalQuite unlike anything Dario Argento has directed before, THE STENDHAL SYNDROME is a grimly realistic portrait of a female  police officer (Asia Argento, essentially miscast) whose encounters with a sadistic rapist/serial killer (Thomas Kretschmann) have devastating consequences. Though distinguished by some truly horrific violence, played straight by Argento with few of his trademark stylistic flourishes, the film is much too languid for its own good, wasting a lot of valuable time on an otherwise laudable attempt to depict the long-term consequences of a vicious sexual assault on the central character. Furthermore, the harsh  subject matter allows no room for levity, and the austere scenario is at odds with the sumptuous artwork that acts as a catalyst for the murderous proceedings. Asia's convulsive reactions to works of art (hence the ornate title) makes her a target for Kretschmann's psychopathic killer, allowing Argento to fill the screen with paintings, sculptures and beautiful objet d'art, which offsets the film's own lack of visual flair.But there's a fierce intelligence underpinning the somewhat predictable scenario: When Asia de-emphasizes her femininity in response to the initial attack, only to re-establish her womanhood after a second assault in which she emerges the victor (or does she?), it becomes easier to forgive the painfully obvious surprises which clog up the final quarter. Only one scene recalls the best of Argento's work: A potential victim being stalked through a dimly lit room full of oversized marble statues, a brilliantly edited  sequence which suggests everything and reveals nothing. Overall, ""Stendhal"" may not be vintage Argento, but it's too clever and too unsettling to be easily dismissed, and it gets under the skin like no other horror film in recent memory.

But how many out there actually remember what its original source is, or for that matter, how good a film &quot;The Spy Who  Loved Me&quot; actually was?  This movie is the pinacle of the Roger Moore  era and features his best performance as 007.  But that is only the tip of  the iceberg.

269249,"Prior to the legendary performance by George C. Scott in PATTON, my only exposure to this great actor had been THE FLIM-FLAM MAN, released in 1967. I actually saw it at a drive-in movie, which, for those too young to remember, was essentially a parking lot with a huge screen at one end. Patrons paid at an entrance kiosk, drove in, parked next to a speaker mounted at each parking space, and watched the show (unless, as might happen with young couples, hormone levels dictated inattention to the plot).Scott plays Mordecai Jones, Master of Back-Stabbin', Cork-Screwin' and Dirty Double-Dealin'. While unfortunately regarded as a con artist by the general populace, he maintains that he profits only from the greed of others, and that an honest man can't be taken advantage of. In this comedy, his wanderings have brought him to the South, where he hooks up with Curley, a young Army deserter played by Michael Sarrazin. Along the way, the world savvy Mordecai teaches Curley lessons about life, while together they successfully fleece some of the region's less upright citizens. A basically decent kid, Curley suffers pangs of conscience over their scams, but remains sufficiently undebilitated to fall in love with a cutie played by Sue Lyon, daughter of a local Prominent Citizen.The film has a marvelous cast of character actors familiar to Baby Boomers: Jack Albertson, Strother Martin, Albert Salmi, Slim Pickens, and Harry Morgan. Morgan (otherwise remembered as Joe Friday's partner on TV's DRAGNET, and as Colonel Potter on TV's MASH), is particularly good as the local-yokel sheriff out to nab our two heroes.THE FLIM-FLAM MAN is a gentle, humorous fairy tale played out on a stage that could never exist. For instance, nary a single black is encountered as the story unfolds. And this is below the Mason-Dixon Line? However, that shouldn't detract from the affection that the viewer will feel for the wily and wise Mordecai, who is certainly a rascal, but a surprisingly honorable one. Light entertainment? Most assuredly. But, it doesn't get any better than this.",The Flim Flam Man VHS

She is being courted by an American soldier, Captain Pringle (John Lund).On her way to Berlin is Phoebe Frost (Jean Arthur), an icy woman from America, who is going to record her visit and report back to the government.

158228,"&quot;May the Force Be With You Always&quot;Obi-One KenobiGeorge Lucas's unforgettable Star Wars is one of the most influential, mythically engaging, and highly enjoyable science fiction films of all time. Though it  can be said that Lucas borrowed cinematic ideas from Akira Kurosaka (Hidden  Fortress), Howard Hawks, and John Ford (The Searchers). Does Star Wars  really deserve to be called too simplistic or underserving of all it's  popularity? NO NO NO! , Star Wars is modern film myth that has engaged its  fans in its timeless tale for the last 23 years. What the Star Wars Haters  need to realize is that we the fans find this wonderful myth of good, evil,  fate, and destiny to be one of the most enlightening and blissful voyages  that the movies have ever given us. Star Wars is a tribute to the power and  expressiveness of the movies. What make Star Wars so superior to the  numerous clones that followed it is despite its magnificent special  effects, that defined a new age in Sci/Fi, the film's characters, mythos,  and epic story are what made Star Wars so universally accepted and beloved  around the world. Not only have the characters of Luke Skywalker, Darth  Vader, Han Solo, and R2D2 become permanent parts of movie culture. The  simple yet important moral that good will eventually overcome all evil no  matter the time, suffering, loss, or failure involved makes Star Wars the  modern equivalent of the Wizard of Oz. It tells it's tale simply and  elequently. It moves us with its images and people. It takes us to a time  and place that will never leave the boundries of our memory. Star Wars is  joy to behold, and anyone who feels otherwise is too stuck up to see the  beauty of a universe a long time ago in a galaxy far far away. Star Wars  Fans: May the Force Always Be With Each and Every One of You. I can't wait  to see all the episodes on DVD.",Star Wars Trilogy THX Digitally Mastered Edition
154576,"In the film Dead End, the murky waters of Manhattan's East River served as an appropriate backdrop for the squalor that manifested itself within the conefines of tenament housing.  City streets that offered little hope for  the jobless, poor, and oppressed were truely &quot;dead ends&quot;.  Written by Lillian Hellman and directed by William Wyler, Dead End exposed  the stark social and economic divisions between the affluent and the  underpriveledged.  Logistically, the film was easily adapted from Sidney  Kingsley's stage play, as most of the scenes are shot within the shadows of  Manhattan's East 53rd street highrises. Dead End is essentially about  people and their relationship with the neighborhood that spawned them.  Gangster Baby Face Martin ( Humphrey Bogart) returns to his old block  seeking glorified acceptance from his mother, only to be rudely rebuffed.  Plastic surgery may conceal Martin's outward identity, but his crimminal  persona is clearly defined through his street wise and violent attitude  towards survival. At first Martin basks in the limelight; preening with  sharp suit, hat, and polished shoes.  As if to make a social statement  exclaiming the virtues and rewards of crime, Martin becomes an icon for a  teenage street gang (The Dead End Kids).  When Martin is shocked by his  mother's repulsive behavior, he seeks out his old flame (Clair Trevor).  When she reveals that she is now a prostitute, Martin once again becomes  tormented  that his homecoming is a lonely one.  Sylvia Sydney plays Drina,  a young unemployed woman struggling to forge an identity of her own while  raising her teenage brother.  Drina can only dream about escaping the  confines of her depressing neighborhood, since her childhood beau ( Joel  McCrea) has been enticed by a society girl ( Wendy Barrie) who resides in  an exclusive penthouse overlooking the shoddy apartments that define Dead  End. Huntz Hall, Gabriel Dell, Leo Gorcey, and the rest of the Dead End  kids provide enough street talk to make an English teacher cringe with  embarrassment. Is there a way out of Dead End? Most street toughs assumed a  life of crime would free them from poverty.  Others set up businesses  relying on the patronage of tenanment residents to keep the bills paid.  Others relied on marriage in hopes of &quot;marrying up&quot;.  Still  others sought education as a way out.  The year is 2000, and if you visit  the streets of Manhattan above 110th street not much has changed since  Wyler's 1937 film Dead End.",N/A

445834,"Mario Bava's BLACK SABBATH (original Italian title--THE THREE FACES OF FEAR) is easily one of my favorite DVD releases this year, both in terms of  the new transfer and the film itself.Like Bava's earlier BLACK SUNDAY,  this film was re-edited by AIP for its American release, and it is that  version which we've always seen in the US. The original Italian version  plays the episodes in a different order: &quot;The Telephone,&quot;  &quot;The Wurdalak&quot; and &quot;The Drop of Water.&quot; The lesbian  content of &quot;The Telephone&quot; was of course toned down for American  audiences. It also has a prologue and epilogue which are different from  those shot for the American release. You may find that the comic epilogue  doesn't fit with the rest of the picture, but I enjoyed its  self-deprecating humor. The original score by Roberto Nicolosi supports the  mood of the film better than Les Baxter's AIP score and it subtly ties the  three episodes together through recurring thematic material. If you've only  seen this film in the AIP version, you really owe it to yourself to see the  original Italian version-there IS a difference.The letterboxed DVD  transfer looks beautiful. The print is worn in places, but the colors are  vivid and the rich details of the set design come through. Having known the  film only from a cropped VHS transfer, watching the DVD was like seeing a  new film altogether. Indeed, Bava's masterful use of lighting, color and  camera movement, his eye for dramatic detail, only confirms what a  brilliant director he was. From a purely stylistic standpoint, this is one  of the great horror films. Tim Lucas, as usual, provides informative liner  notes.",Black Sabbath VHS
511896,"Andy Kaufman's style of entertainment erased lines between himself and his audience.

275789,"I have not seen the DVD of this movie, but will comment on the movie itself:With a movie based around dogs running a gambling (rat races) and bar joint, it already earns coolness factor among children's fare. As a child of about 9 when this movie was originally released (ten years ago) these references went straight over my head.  Strangely the movie is still entertaining, although slipping a bit into typical heartwarming stuff after the introduction of the little girl into the mix (who is being held by Charlie's - the German Shephard-like lead dog voiced wonderfully by Burt Reynolds - nemesis, Carface because she can talk to animals and thus know who will win the day's race.)Set in New Orleans, the main plot (which the rest is filler really) is Charlie and his partner Itchy return to the joint that Charlie and Carface used to run together (up until Charlie was thrown into the clinker - the dog pound - until Itchy got him out, the great escape is where the movie begins) and under the guise of helping Charlie set up his own place, Carface holds a party at Mardi Gras where Charlie gets a little too sloshed and makes him an easy target for a cleancut murder.  All dogs go to heaven of course despite the fact there's little record of our lead actually doing any good in his earthly canine life, but heaven wasn't good enough for Charlie, he wants revenge, so he steals his watch of life, winds it back up and heads back down for Vengeance upon the ones who has done him wrong.  That's when his life gets entangled with the little orphan girl (called &quot;Squeaker&quot; by him through most of the movie after a rather cute scene which I won't spoil here), who he 'rescues' for 'using' her for his own selfish purposes instead of helping the child realize her dreams, but his coming to care for her in turn ends up leading to his own true salvation.A very 'dark' film, in lighting and sometimes even in story, there's many morals to be found underneath, the biggest being that even imperfect people (or animals) have goodness in their heart, they only have to reach out and open their hearts to find it.  The badguys are truly bad although the lead villan's Chihuahua looking scrapgoat shows a kinder side sometimes, and are played out kind of like mobsters and not too over-the-top.  There are no ridiculous ambitions, simply the doing in of Charlie so that his claim to the business is his void (he'd be dead afterall), which is a refreshing pace from superhero movies.  The voice acting is very good in most cases, and a couple of the songs don't even make adults cringe too much (especially the one in heaven is quite nice).A well done film throughout, which spawned a mediocre sequel and animated series.  However, there's no substitute for the original, which is one of the best animated movies to come out of the 90s period.  Children will love it, and adults will be able to watch it without feeling too ill or out of place, and those that grew up on it, probably still hold it close to their hearts.",N/A
450553,"Once again, we have Gwyneth Paltrow delving into the world of the Brits and sporting an English accent in a story where the director's view seems to be that regardless of the circumstances, fate still plays a vital role  in the final outcome. It is an experiment of the rhetoric &quot;What  if...?&quot;, a splicing of two cells containing scenarios, and their  embryotic outcomes spawning as the film progresses. It begins with our lab  rat (Helen Quilley) leaving her place of employment after she's just been  fired. The cell-dividing begins when she heads for the subway and the two  scenarios are shown consecutively where first she misses the train, and the  second half where she catches it at the last moment. In scenario two, she  arrives home to a cheating boyfriend (a despicable, weak-minded weasel  played convincingly by John Lynch) in mid-coitus with his old lover Lydia,  who is portrayed with amusing fury by Jeanne Tripplehorn. In the previous  scenario, she is forced to walk home after missing the train and is mugged,  taking a trip to the local emergency room and buying time for Gerry (the  cheating boyfriend) to usher Lydia out of the apartment.Where it goes  from there, the scenarios are easily distinguishable. The jilted Helen  packs her bags and moves in with her feisty Irish girlfriend Anna (great  performance by Zara Turner) and cuts her hair, dying it blonde. She then  attaches herself to a new boyfriend with a thick, Scottish accent free of  fabrication named James (great comedic timing on the part of John Hannah).  Both stories have their similarities, which you will see when watching are  the hands of fate working their magic even though the circumstances are  different.I have to give a hand to the writers of this screenplay for  the great one-liners that came out of this movie and the overall snappy wit  of each character. You even have your comedy relief in the form of Gerry's  wisecracking friend Russell, played by Douglas McFerran.This film had a  very good cast and I was intrigued by the premise, but my only problem was  Gwyneth's accent. Yes, she does it better than most, but compared to people  who really did have an English accent, she needs a little more practice  before she can even have Americans fooled. Other than that small detail,  this is a very entertaining and very humorous movie, despite its  surprisingly dour ending.",N/A

308635,"I can only review this film because of its subject matter, which is of central interest to a society on the verge of forgetting entirely where it came from (much less knowing where it is going). So because it is so  important a story, however badly the film itself has been handled has to be  partly overlooked.Set in Amazonia, the film bears some remarkable  similarities to ""Black Robe,"" the Canadian historical film of some years  ago. Both films deal with ""first contact"" with the natives, and in so  doing, they present a cinematographically rich portrait of native cultures.  One wonders if they are not overdone in fact; the details of costuming  (sic) and decor are extravagantly attended to. Indeed, that is where the  film falls down for me: too much attention to detail and a complete loss of  rapport with the viewer in the meantime, as the main story gets lost as  much as any explorer ever did in any jungle. In addition, the impact of  this film's occasionally grandiose photography is (as in ""Black Robe"")  somewhat lost on the television screen.There are entire sections that  might be cut right out of this unnecessarily long film. So from the  beginning, we have to deal with a poor script, which has us undergo all  sorts of very unsatisfactory gimmicks and complications. Planes almost, but  not quite, fly into waterfalls; an Indian trips on the local soma and goes  bananas... In the best Hollywood tradition, nothing is allowed to happen in  an ordinary way. The story is loud and stops and starts fitfully, obviously  uncertain of its direction. The European actors are third rate and quite  unbelievable. The natives, at least, who must have felt somewhat more at  home in this exotic location, are an improvement. And there the story lies,  with whatever interest anybody might take from the overall picture: the  natives are being dispossessed as fast as land can be cleared for cattle to  graze on so we in North America can eat plenty of hamburgers. It's an old  story now, but has anything changed? This is taken from the book of the  same name, written by the very fine author, Peter Matthiessen. Pity he  didn't write the scenario as well.",N/A
475955,"The common theme running through George Lucas' work is visual genius  marked by artistic laziness.  Like most geniuses, Lucas works best within a  limited palette of expertise.  If you want stunning visuals and bombastic  sound, he's your man.  If you want a storyline with some level of  sophistication beyond Saturday morning cartoons, it's best to look  elsewhere.Star Wars fans (and I consider myself one) can whine all  they want, but childishness is an inherent part of Lucas' cinematic ouevre.Whenever Lucas steps away from the controls and lets someone else drive  the plot, the results are as amazing as &quot;The Empire Strikes  Back&quot;, the hands-down favorite of most Star Wars fans.  When George is  actively engaged in the script, we get dreck like the Ewoks and Phantom  Menace's Jar Jar Binks.&quot;Episode I-The Phantom Menace&quot; could  never live up to its prerelease hype in any event, but with Lucas firmly in  command the movie is even more execrable than may otherwise have been the  case.  How bad is it?- The incoherent plot involves some nonsense  about interstellar trade regulations- The Force, previously a kind of  New Age mysticism, now seemingly stems from a parasitic infection- The  main force for good is a 14-year old &quot;elected queen&quot; of a planet  named Naboo, of all things, who spends much of the movie in Kabuki makeup  speaking in desultory monotone- The villain never speaks a word, and  seemingly exists for the sole purpose of having a lightsaber duel with two  of the heroes- A major character actually chooses slavery over freedom,  mainly as a cheap way to write her out of subsequent scenes- Unlike Luke  Skywalker, who had a painful and awkward apprenticeship before emergind as  a full-blown hero in &quot;Return of the Jedi&quot;, Anakin Skywalker is  invincible from the word go, despite being only 9 years oldThe movie is  a colossal disappointment, and not just due to the inflated expectations of  fans.  While a number of the visuals are simply stunning, the plot is a  total mess, which substantially undermines the movie's impact.  The final  victory comes so cheaply and ridiculously as to serve as a sort of parody  of the first film (imagine Luke destroying the Death Star in a Landspeeder  while on the way to Tachi Station to look at some power convertors and  you'll see what I mean).Fans hope against hope that the second  installment will counter this trend and restore some sense of menace to the  series.

Baoh reminds me in some ways of &quot;Guyver&quot;  in that he is an organic superhero with all sorts of fun abilities. It's  somewhat mindless, and as I said before, quite light on the plot and  character development, but surprisingly enjoyable anyway. An interesting  touch is that Baoh apparently cannot speak when transformed, although they  sometimes allow the audience to hear his thoughts.I found the voice  acting average. Both Walken and the head of Doress overacted their parts  terribly, especially the latter, but most of the rest were competent if not  overwhelming. Music was also eminently forgettable, but appropriate for  whatever scene it was in. Also somewhat lacking was character development.  All the characters were pretty much stock for the genre, but I list that as  a neutral factor. If they weren't riveting, at least they weren't boring or  stupid.I said it before, and I'll say it again. As animation goes, it's  one of the best I've ever seen.

460475,"How do you make a funny movie using a morgue and prostitution as subject matter?  Leave it to screenwriters Lowell Ganz and Babaloo Mandel, who put a rollicking script in the hands of director Ron Howard, who ran with it  and ended up scoring a minor comedy classic with ""Night Shift.""  Chuck  Lumley (Henry Winkler) is in something of a funk; he's been relegated to  the night shift at the morgue where he's worked for years, thanks to the  nepotism of his boss, who has installed a nephew into Chuck's day shift.  Now Chuck has to train the new man, one Bill Blazejowski (Michael Keaton) a  real ""idea man"" who can't sit still and never seems to quit talking, much  to the chagrin of the conservative Chuck, who likes to keep things quiet  and simple.  When Chuck befriends Belinda (Shelley Long), a neighbor in his  apartment who just happens to be a prostitute, Bill gets wind of it and has  an idea.  Belinda and her friends are in a dangerous business, and they  could use some help and protection.  Nights at the morgue are slow, and  they have a limo at their disposal (Sure, it's a hearse, but slap a sign on  the door, and you're in business).  Bill convinces Chuck that they could  make a fortune as ""love brokers,"" working right out of the morgue.  And  soon Chuck's life will never be the same.  Keaton is absolutely  spectacular as Bill (""Call me `Billy Blaze'""), in whom he has created a  totally off-the-wall, quirky, uniquely nuanced and endearing character  you're never going to forget.  He pulls out all the stops and never quits,  playing perfectly off of Winkler's reserved and cautious-to-a-fault Chuck,  the perfect foil for Bill.  The timing between these two is right on the  mark, and Howard keeps the pace steady and the laughs coming.  Wisely, the  story avoids any moralizing or delving into the murky waters of the subject  matter; after all, this is a comedy, not ""Taxi Driver,"" and Howard never  lets it slip even close to leaving the laugh track.  He keeps it light and  funny and makes sure the characters are real people; there's no buffoonery  or slapstick here, and it keeps the real humor centered and at the heart of  the story.  Shelley Long, too, adds a nice touch with her spin on Belinda,  the hooker with the heart-of-gold.  The supporting cast includes Gina  Hecht (Charlotte), Pat Corley (Edward), Bobby Di Cicco (Leonard), Nita  Talbot (Vivian), Clint Howard (Jefferey) and Joe Spinell (Manetti); and  look closely for Kevin Costner as a frat boy in the party scene at the  morgue.  Howard gets high marks for making ""Night Shift"" a memorable  comedy, and for keeping the dynamic Keaton on track to deliver one of the  most singular performances of his career.  This is a movie with heart, and  most importantly, plenty of laughs.  You'll be glad you didn't let this one  pass you by.",N/A

I expected the sort of criticism I saw in a post about &quot;American Beauty,&quot; in which the writer said that people who couldn't appreciate that one would probably like dreck like &quot;Die Hard.&quot;  Well, &quot;Die Hard&quot; is the better film, because (1) it sets out to do something more admirable and (2) it achieves it.  It sets out to be not just an action thriller, but a generous and original one.  (&quot;American Beauty&quot; was anything but original, and now enough said about that.)  Look at all of the genuine humor laced throughout the dialogue.  Look at how so many scenes appear to have been written, then written again and again, as if the screenwriter said, &quot;OK, we've moved the plot along here; now, how can we make this moment even more complex and hair-raising?&quot;This is the one Hollywood action movie that has been truly well thought out.  Every seemingly inconsequential thing -- including McClane's fear of flying (&quot;fists with your toes&quot;) to Holly slamming his photo face-down on the credenza -- turns out to be crucial to the plot!  That was so impressive.And has there ever been an action twist as delicious as Gruber confronting McClane when the latter doesn't know who Gruber really is (or does he?).  The theater audiences almost giggled with delight and tension.  Not to mention the leap off the roof -- the pivotal moment by which all other Big Action Scenes need to be judged.  And right there is an example of the generous filmmakers giving us more than we might ordinarily expect -- moments after the leap, we get (1) the possibility of his being stuck dangling there, and (2) the absolutely sweat-inducing moments immediately following his solution to the dangling situation (I'm not giving too much away).  (My only complaint about the leap is that McClane would have been gripping that hose for dear life, not throwing his hands over his head.  That, and the fact that his double had longer hair that was slicked back.)The whole terrorists vs. common thieves element also adds to our pure enjoyment -- instead of being thrust into a contemporary plot, the sort of which we usually go to the movies to escape, we get a story as elemental as a Roy Rogers western.  So it's appropriate that McClane's signature expression should be -- well, I can't say here.See this one, but see it in widescreen: there's at least one moment -- in the lobby of the tower -- when the suspense in pan-and-scan is non-existent because you literally can't see that one of the protagonists is unknowingly walking within a few feet of one of the bad guys.",N/A
325978,"I read &quot;Of Mice and Men&quot; for my English GCSE course,and I still can't get my mind around how simple and perfect it is as abook. Gary Sinise's film is a truthful adaptation, with only some slight changes, and captures the mood of the book pretty well.  I have to say that the most moving scene for me is still the final one. It brings tears to my eyes, every time. The cinematography is beautiful, all green foliage and crisp golden wheat - the use of light is particularly effective in moments such as the pivotal barn scene, where the golden beams peering through the darkened slats of wood make the picture both shadowy and light at the same time ...  John Malkovich is excellent as the retarded Lennie - it is always difficult to accept watching a well-known and intelligent actor play a retard, but he manages to defeat the viewer's preconceptions, and he convincingly shows Lennie's childishness, his incomprehension. Gary Sinise is perfect as George: physically suited, subtle and deeply moving.  Hehe ... now for the inevitable nit-picking. The main problem - though not so much a problem as a bit too much of a good thing - is that the setting seems to have been evoked so caringly it is almost too lavish.  It threatens to make the workers' lifestyle seem too attractive, not more detached and monotonous as it appears in the book. The support cast, while good are maybe sometimes too obviously sympathetic - Curley's wife's mean streak has been played down, and Slim seems more ordinary, less detached and &quot;majestic&quot; than in the book.  These are minor flaws though. In fact, the film's structure is quite sparse, and does not fall into the trap that other adaptations can, of sprawling or simply relying on the book's clout and key scenes to see them through.

524568,"Despite various flaws, this film succeeds at creating a strong drama with two excellent performances by Tommy Lee Jones and Samuel L. Jackson.  It is an interesting premise in today's world where the lines between politics and warfare become ever fuzzier.  Is a commander justified to engage an enemy to protect his men if there is a high probability of killing innocents?  With increasing frequency, radical groups use human shields to capitalize on this Western dilemma.  This film brought some of these issues to the fore, and though sloppily done in parts, it was an entertaining treatment of the issue.Director William Friedkin (The French Connection) is no stranger to action flicks, and the action scenes were extraordinarily realistic.  The trial was also well done from a dramatic standpoint, but some glaring flaws went unexplained.  For instance, are we to believe that with all the firing that occurred from the ground, forensics experts couldn't find a single bullet hole with a ground-based trajectory?By far the best aspect of this film was the acting.  Tommy Lee Jones was outstanding as the shot-up marine who turned into a second rate lawyer to stay in the service.  Samuel L. Jackson continued to prove himself one of the better dramatic actors around with a stellar performance of the dedicated career officer thrown into an impossible situation and then fed to the wolves.  Guy Pearce also gave a fine performance as the prosecutor for the government, although he tried to hide his British accent by putting on a New York accent and it sounded phony.Though unoriginal (see &quot;A Few Good Men&quot;), this is a very watchable drama with some credibility problems, but the flaws were more than overcome by the great acting.  I rated it a 7/10.  It offers food for thought regarding the difficult demands we make on our military in the world of post cold war international diplomacy.",N/A

192252,"Well, I rented this movie expecting a horror show.  What I got was a movie  that was more intruiging than scary.  I wasn't scared at all, in fact, but  some of the deeper plot elements kept me watching until the end.I did  not like the fact that most of the shots of the grotesque Van Daans were so  brief you did not get much of a look at them, but from a scientific  person's point of view, it kept you wondering about how this could have  happened to a family.The only part that made me sick was Jon Strauss's  having to eat...that fetus that had been soaking in formaldehyde for 75  years.  *That* was going beyond the good--or bad--tastes of any horror  film.  Horror film cannibalism is one thing, but this was overstepping  bounds.On the other hand, the element that interested me most, and  dissapointed me because it wasn't really resolved that well, was Kathleen's  baby.  It's a Van Daan.  Was it a boy or a girl?  Born with the horribly  mutated gene's of it's father?  Would it have to come back to the abandoned  island one day if it displays the symptoms of Jon's blood disease?I wish  that factor had been addressed more, but if they ever make a sequal--and  this I doubt, it was a B-movie--I would hope it would be this child coming  back, whether for medical reasons or simply to explore his/her twisted  roots.Now *that* would make an interesting movie element.",N/A

442046,"This film  is loosely based on the classic Dickens novel.  Very loosely.Set in modern times, it moves from the Florida Gulf Coast to New York with certain key elements familiar to readers of the original story.  There's a young boy who encounters a convict played by Robert DiNiro as a Mafioso. There's an eccentric old lady, played by a Anne Bancroft who wears brightly colored designer clothes, smokes cigarettes and guzzles martinis. Gwyneth Paltrow plays the icy young lady with cool detachment.  And Ethan Hawke is cast as the young man, a bit too much of a hunk for the role which is written to have him become the darling of the art world.There's a lot of star power here, and some nudity, but not much else.  The script does not do justice to Dickens' intentions.  We've come to expect good cinematography these days and so I must say that the Florida gulf coast really did look good.  What is lacking, however, is the dark brooding atmosphere.In some respects this is a pleasant video although it moves too slowly and never grabbed my emotions.  Gwyneth Paltrow does look pretty.  And Robert DiNiro gives an excellent performance.  But in a world where we can make choices about our entertainment, there's a lot better out there.  And if Charles Dickens were alive today, I'm sure he would agree.",Great Expectations VHS

211713,"One of the greatest films of the eighties, &quot;An Officer and a Gentleman&quot; -- the tale of a raw recruit struggling to complete a  gruelling training program in an aviation academy -- combines impressive  performances from its stellar cast with a storyline exploring issues of  romance, friendship and the courage to survive. The relationship between  the recruit Zach Mayo (Richard Gere) and the tough gunnery seargeant Foley  (an unforgettable Louis Gosset Jr.) is the focus of the film. Foley warns  Mayo that he will be courting the local girls at his own risk, since some  may deliberately cause themselves to get pregnant in order to ensnare  budding aviators into marrying them. This theme is poignantly developed  when Mayo's best friend, played by David Keith, sacrifices his aviating  career for the sake of a girl who fakes her pregnancy to trap and deceive  him, leading to his tragic suicide. The dialogue between the two friends in  the mess room is one of the most absorbing scenses in the film. It makes a  significant point about individuality and responsibility. Mayo is the  clear-headed realist: he believes that one should always put his own  self-interest first and concern himself primarily with his own welfare, a  view which is opposed by his duty-bound and eventually love-crossed friend,  the kind-hearted loser whose morality gets the better of his sense. A very  uplifting film, with excellent support from Debra Winger as Mayo's love,  Paula. There is also an excellent musical score by Jack Nitzsche.",An Officer and A Gentleman VHS

523563,"You really get yor money's worth with &quot;Gladiator&quot;! This is a DVD lover's dream come true --- an epic movie loaded with tons of extras. First and foremost, this two-disc set features a beautiful widescreen print of one of the most visually stunning films in Hollywood's history. Director Ridley Scott and crew bring Ancient Rome to life in a grandiose fashion not seen since &quot;Ben Hur&quot;. The images are so crisp and 3-dimensional that it's hard to believe so much of this film is computer generated. The DTS sound really delivers. Crank it up during the intensely  thrilling Roman Coliseum battles. It's like being front-row and center as the heroic Maximus (Russell Crowe) slays both man and beast during some of the most riveting fight scenes ever filmed. Of course, all the visual effects in the world are worthless if the movie itself fails to deliver. No worry here. The tension between Maximus and Emperor Commodus (a wonderfully evil Joaquin Phoenix) carries &quot;Gladiator&quot; from beginning to bloody end. Phoenix is one of the creepiest bigscreen villains of all-time-- a snide, backstabing traitor. Crowe, however, is as heroic as Phoenix is evil. I guarantee you'll cheer Crowe's every move during their imminent showdown. It's a battle of pure bloody vengeance which, in terms of thrills, is unsurpassed.Just as satisfying as the film itself is the second disc which is packed with extras. Included are a &quot;making of&quot; mini-documentary, and a pair of &quot;behind the scenes&quot; featurettes which provide a lot of interesting insight. Director Scott provides an informative audio commentary which I found to be nearly as good as the movie itself. And if all this isn't enough, you get a ton of deleted scenes (complete with commentary) and a gallery of still photos from the set of &quot;Gladiator&quot;. Overall, this is a first-rate DVD. It's not often that a film of such epic proportions is packaged so well for the home theatre crowd. In fact, the extras alone are worth the price of admission. Highly recommended for action fans.

459035,"Image is releasing these original Twilight Zone episodes NOT in the order  of the original broadcast date (which I would've preferred), but rather in  a way so that each volume contains episodes that have roughly similar  themes.  The result is often that the best episodes, mostly the earlier  ones in the series' 5-season run, are scattered among different  volumes.Volume 7, however, is one of the better ones, since 3 of the 4  episodes selected are among the best in the series: &quot;The  Hitchhiker&quot;, &quot;Perchance to Dream&quot;, &quot;Shadow Play&quot;.  The weakest of the 4 in my opinion is &quot;King Nine will not Return&quot;  but many people like it and think it's one of the best also.  All 4  episodes are about hallucinations or dreams that doom the  protagonist.Picture and sound qualities are superb throughout.  The DVD  also include extra material such as episode descriptions, biographical  notes, and trivias.It is hard to find TV stations that show TZ episodes  these days, and even when they do, they sometimes don't show all the  episodes (especially the 1-hour ones), and episodes are almost always  edited for time.  The TZ episodes on these volumes are uncut and  uninterrupted; and for TZ fans they definitely worth collecting.Programs  like The Twilight Zone are a dead genre.  Today's viewers aren't likely to  watch a sci-fi show without expecting special effects and action scenes.

554469,"They are all here, some of the best Bonds of the series: ""From Russia With Love,"" ""You Only Live Twice,"" ""Diamonds Are Forever,"" ""Octopussy,"" ""A View To A Kill"" and ""The Living Daylights"" There are 3 James Bonds: Sean Connery, Roger Moore and Timothy Dalton. Not bad. John Barry scored all these, too!The print for ""From Russia With Love"" is grainy. ""You Only Live Twice,"" ""Diamonds Are Forever,"" ""Octopussy,"" ""A View To A Kill"" and ""The Living Daylights"" are all excellent. The deleted scenes from ""Diamonds Are Forever"" and ""The Living Daylights"" are very cool! The deleted scene from ""A View To A Kill"" is the best.""A View To A Kill"" is based on ""Goldfinger"" and John Gardner's ""Role of Honor"" this is one of Roger Moore's better James Bond movies. It is a big improvement over director Guy Hamilton's ""Goldfinger"" which tried to be humorous, but was not very successful in that department. Hamilton did finally succeed with his excellent ""Man with the Golden Gun."" It was a mixture of action and humor at its best.""A View To A Kill"" is the most luxurious looking Bond movie. Zorin's magnificent palace and stables are the type of boost that ""Goldfinger"" needed. Zorin, after Scaramanga, has got to be one of the best villains of the series. He's a real psycho. May Day, after Nick Nack, is the best henchman. She gives a real twisted 80's performance.The opening pre-title sequence is one of the best. Bond is being chased down an ice-covered slope by Russian troops in Siberia to an exciting John Barry score highlighted by the Beach Boys' ""California Girls"" while he escapes on a ski mobile runner turned ski board. This is an excellent scene full of action and laughs. The Beach Boys' ""California Girls"" was a stroke of genius. John Barry really knows how to score a Bond movie! The getaway in a mini sub disguised as an iceberg was another stroke of genius. I was on the edge of my seat. Those were better ski scenes than those filmed in ""The Spy Who Loved Me"" and ""The World Is Not Enough."" They were close, but not quite as good as those in ""On Her Majesty's Secret Service"" or ""The Living Daylights.""Duran Duran's opening main theme is the best of the series. It was even better than Lulu's ""Man with the Golden Gun."" Maurice Binder's main titles were his best since ""Man with the Golden Gun.""This film is just so great. Roger Moore looks younger in this one. I never saw him move better. I think these are the most stunts that he ever did in any Bond movie. The fight scene in Zorin's warehouse was one of his best. I like the way he lays out the guard on the conveyor belt and gets automatically wrapped like a corrugated carton. That was very cool.The steeplechase scene was also great and real suspenseful. I didn't know that Roger could ride a horse like that. When he breaks away into the woods that was really well filmed just like the similar scene in ""Moonraker."" Very cool, that's all I can say.The Eiffel Tower scene where Bond is chasing May Day through Paris in a stolen taxi, is one of the greatest scenes in the series. It was so funny. When Bond's taxi gets cut in half I thought he was done for. However, he keeps up with her and manages to crash a wedding on a moving barge. Crazy stuff! This kind of thing is what made the 80s so great!Q had some of his best scenes in this film. The microchip briefing in M's office was good and reminiscent of ""Moonraker"" and ""Octopussy."" I liked Q's surveillance machine. That was very innovative. It was also good to see Bond, Moneypenny and M all at the races. General Gogol had some good scenes too. I like when he puts the cassette in the player in his car and it starts playing the Japanese Spa music. That was really funny.The underwater scenes in this film were excellently filmed. I was holding my breath when Bond taps the tire of the sunken Rolls for air. That was very innovative. Zorin's San Francisco pumping station was also done well. When Bond was underwater I thought for sure he was going to get sucked in by those propeller blades.  That was filmed as good as any underwater scene from ""Thunderball,"" ""For Your Eyes Only."" ""Licence To Kill"" or ""Tomorrow Never Dies.""The sets in this movie were great. The interior of Zorin's airship was very reminiscent of ""Goldfinger"" and ""Diamonds Are Forever."" Zorin's mine was one of the best sets from the entire series. Caves are cool, just like in ""Live and Let Die"" and ""Dr. No."" Just like SPECTRE, Zorin eliminates undesirables just like they were terminated similarly in ""From Russia With Love"" and ""You Only Live Twice.""I liked the way they got the Russians involved in the plot. You can't have a good Bond movie without them. Not to worry, they show up again in ""The Living Daylights"" and ""GoldenEye.""Stacey was the best Bond girl since Mary Goodnight. You really feel for her. I almost thought Bond was going to leave her in the elevator shaft the way she was screaming. Bond saves her just in time. She was also great in the fire engine chase and the ultimate battle between Bond and Zorin on top of the Golden Gate Bridge.This film has it all: action, suspense, humor, laughs, terror, set designs, great underwater scenes and car chases. The only thing it lacked was exotic locales. That is what gives ""Man with the Golden Gun"" and ""Octopussy"" one up on ""A View To A Kill.""",James Bond 007 Collection Volume 3 VHS
574367,"There's been a lot of debating over whether or not this film deserves its Berlin Silver Bear award. In my mind it deserves more than that, for this  is truly a remarkable film.The Million Dollar Hotel is a home for  outcasts and mentally unstable people. Once it was probably a high-class  place, but time has taken its toll and it is now merely a parody of itself.  Inhabitants include a mad Indian Chief wannabe (played by Jimmy Smits), a  guy who thinks he's a member of the Beatles (hilariously played by Peter  Stormare) the retarded ""hero"" of the story Tom Tom (Jeremy Davies) and the  shadowy, silent Elouise (Milla Jovovich) who he has a serious crush on.  One day Tom Tom's nearest friend fall off the roof of the hotel, and foul  play is suspected. It is then up to an FBI Special Agent (Mel Gibson) to  find the murderer. This is no easy task indeed!What sets this movie  apart from the mainstream is that it oozes atmosphere and that is dares to  be *different*. Director Wim Wenders has taken the story by none other than  Bono from U2 and worked his magic on it. The result is a visually stunning  film with some of the most intense moments I've ever seen. Add the amazing  soundtrack, also by Bono, and the excellent performances by all actors and  the result should be obvious: an instant classic.Bear in mind, though,  that this is my opinion of the movie. It is shared by a couple of my  friends, but other reviewers have strongly criticised the film. I fail to  see why, but it just seems to be one of those movies that people either  love or hate. In any case I strongly recommend seeing it, if only to  experience its intense, sad beauty. This is indeed no cheerful film, but it  does have its fair share of funny quirky moments.The Million Dollar  Hotel is one of those rare movies that touch something deep inside me, and  leaves me speechless.

Charlie Brown goes to the mayor's office with a simple solution:  make Snoopy the Pied Piper.Promised a year's supply of dog food for his  services, Snoopy (armed with a concertina instead of a pipe) begins to  magically lure the mice out of town.

So Snoopy plays his concertina once  again, magically compelling the mayor and his council to dance out of town  to the tune of &quot;Snoopy, the Pied Piper.&quot;  All's well that ends  well.It's good to see the gang doing something a little different for  a change, but though I liked this story, I prefer original Peanuts tales  rather then faerytale retellings.As for this DVD release, there's some  good and bad.  The good is the bonus feature of a special 11 minute  retrospective interview with Peanuts creator Charles M. Schulz.

441102,"The FILM: After all those years, Sam Raimi's debut feature still delivers very well. This film did not only become a cult favourite because of its excessive use of gore, but because it was made by a bunch of very talented people. You want proof? Here you go: The special effects seem, especially to our nowadays CGI-spoiled eyes, very cheap, crude and primitive, yet the film still works extremely well. Even after all those years, the film still manages to conjure a very special atmosphere which greatly contributes to the success of this film.

The DVD: The picture quality is hardly striking but, considering the source material (it was, after all, an &quot;amateur&quot;-film), very pleasing.

501783,"This film is a remake of the 1962 horror classic of the same name.  The 1962 original was atmospheric, darkly poetic, haunting; its story a subtle balance between two alternate interpretations.This is none of those.  This remake is a clunky mess, arbitrarily meandering through pointless  scenes and aimless &quot;monsters&quot; lifted from JACOB'S LADDER.Aside from the monsters, a line, too, is lifted from JACOB'S LADDER.  The one about demons and angels.  This makes *some* sense, as both the  original CARNIVAL OF SOULS and JACOB'S LADDER are inspired by Bierce's  &quot;Occurance at Owl Creek Bridge.&quot;The 1962 film had a beginning,  a middle, and a twist ending.  This 1998 remake has numerous beginnings,  middles, and ends.  Scenes switch back and forth as the lead character  keeps &quot;waking up&quot; to indicate that all that went on before was a  dream.  If not for the rough road map provided by the original film, we'd  have an even murkier idea of what's going on.Basically, a woman drives  into the river, and at times seems to have escaped, at times is just now  escaping, at times appears never to have driven into the river at  all...Not clever, just confused and confusing.The original film's  cool lead actress portrayed a young woman afraid of life, who &quot;hadn't  really lived.&quot;  It was subtle, yet the point was made.

303314,"All in the Family is the best show of the 1970's, and possibly the greatest comedy show of all time. This tape highlights the funniest moments of the program, but to truly appreciate the genius of All in the Family,  entire episodes must be seen.  I personally have on video nearly every  episode of this wonderful show.  It is amazing that throughout a run of  almost an enitre decade, virtually every episode was thought-provoking,  shocking, heart-warming, and most of all, side-splittingly funny.  The  characters of Archie and Edith Bunker are permanently stamped on the  landscape of American television.  Archie, outrageously bigoted, was deep  down a caring and thoughtful man, who occasionally shows his ability to be  a man of intense compassion and love, especially for his loving and loyal  wife Edith.  Archie was capable of acts of incredible stupidity and  calousness, but when his family was in trouble, he always came through.  It  is a program that will never be replicated, and can simply never be topped.  It is a portrait of a narrow minded man and his innane, backwards beliefs,  but it managed to capture a nation of loyal fans.  Watching just a few  episodes of All in the Family (some of which are available from Amazon.com  on video in their entirety) only serves to emphasize how truly dull and  unimaginative American television has become.

251129,"I have longed to see this film for years, and I finally watched it Christmas Day! Spectacular!The movie was easy to follow with the subtitles and the closeups of the notes the Phantom was writing.A powerful performance by Lon Chaney, and the catacombs below the Paris Opera House were indeed spooky and helped to make the later half of the movie that much more suspenseful.I now have seen all movie versions of this. All of them were good, but not having seen many silent movies, this Phantom of the Opera truly captivated me. It is a shame that Chaney died before his time. I have read he only made one sound picture before his death in 1930. It would have been great had he made this role with sound. Truly haunting!I would like to see Universal do another remake of Phantom of the Opera using the same style makeup Chaney had and follow the story line closely without adding all the blood and gore of today's flicks.For the horror movie buff such as myself, the 1925 Phantom of the Opera is a wonderful addition to my collection!

423570,"This movie is an unsurpassed, old-fashioned adventure tale about friendship, and tragic, over-reaching ambition.  As an adventure, it far exceeds the wildly more popular but childish Indiana Jones series.This  movie follows the adventure of Daniel Dravot and Peachy Carnahan, two  rakish ne'er-do-wells in the British Army in India.  They leave the  service, and, alone, they pack guns and supplies and head north to  Kafiristan, a distant and mysterious land they've only heard tales about,  to become Kings, and plunder the kingdom.When they arrive, they pit  warring communities against each other.  During battle, Connery's character  is mistaken for a god when he is shot (in his leather bandolier), and  doesn't bleed.  As a result, he is made King. He is brought to the Holy  City, where the holy men mistake him for &quot;Son of Sekander,&quot; that  is, the Son of Alexander The Great.  They prostrate themselves before him,  and give him access to Alexander's treasure, which they have guarded for  centuries.Instead of taking the money and running, however, Connery  gets big-headed, gets to liking the role of King, and wants to stay and  administer his kingdom, which he does, and does well, it seems.As you  would expect, that's not the end of the story...but I don't want to give  any more away.This movie is also humorous.  It certainly isn't a comedy,  but the heroes joke with one another, and the humor arises from their  relationship, their fondness for one another, not from improbably comic  situations.This is a grand movie that treats grand themes, and it is  worth seeing over and over again.

Much of the action is on the desert. It is quite talkative. It is long. But with all this said, it still dazzles the eye and mind. The Blu-ray edition is an excellent package. Forget the criticisms that the filmmakers fiddled with history and that Peter O'Toole isn't physically suited to play the role. He is excellent, and the supporting cast, several of whom were Lean favorites over the course of his career (Alec Guinness, Jack Hawkins, Omar Sharif) show how the best actors can assume different roles without making the viewer feel he has seen the same character too many times.

Director Miyazaki's talents shine in this movie with beautiful animation and simple pleasures.  The  story is set in the late 1950's when a college professor moves to the  country with his two daughters who are approximately five and eight years  of age.  The family is happy for the most part, but their mother is  confined to a hospital for an illness not identified in the story.  The  girls are enchanted with their new home, an old spacious house situated in  the country, surrounded by farms and forests.  Unusual events begin to take  place with mysterious little creatures running around the house and strange  winds and noises outside the house at night.  Eventually the girls discover  Totoro, a large mythical creature who looks like a cross between a bear and  rabbit; he's big!  Mei, the youngest of the two girls, meets him first and  she's the one who names him ""Totoro."" Satsuki, the older sister,  meets Totoro later in the film while waiting for her father at a lonely  bus-stop during an evening rainstorm, which is probably the most enjoyable  scene in the movie.

I've never been to a Trekkie Convention or donned Spock ears but I'm versed enough in all the original series episodes to know that if you see kids in the first  scene, you'd better switch the channel. So, when the rave reviews for  GALAXY QUEST began to appear hailing the flick as a hilarious send-up of  STAR TREK, you know I just had to check it out. Well, I'm glad I did 'cause  this one's definitely a winner and a keeper!To begin with, the film's  writers are familiar enough with the STAR TREK universe to whip out some  well-aimed satirical phaser blasts. The thinly-veiled jabs at William  Shatner (the ham everyone loves to peck at)-- and his often rocky relations  with the rest of the STAR TREK cast (read their books)-- are witty and  on-target but not mean-spirited. Likewise, their take on the die-hard  Trekkies-- who have been mercilessly lampooned on everything from SATURDAY  NIGHT LIVE to THE SIMPSONS-- is hysterical without being nasty.

From the opening shots of Stephanie romping in the ocean with her family, it's a loser.  She is literally whispering the instructions in the warm up, kind of under her breath.  I wonder if they inadvertently released one of her warmup rehearsals because she is mostly talking to herself here--certainly not to motivate her audience.  The music has no discernible beat, but rather is a sort of 70's style sax and drum-riff background, which couldn't be more boring.  (If you watch carefully, she actually looks bored herself about 20 minutes into it.) She doesn't seem to understand the nature of working out to a video. If you mirror her pose to follow along, you will have to turn your head to see the screen, which of course is the wrong stance--she could at least have split the screen so you can see the proper stance, but mimic her straight on, eyes front.  With no beat to go by, it's difficult to follow along at her pace anyway, and you're best off getting the combination she wants down and using your own music!

44407,"From the creative mind of producer Darren Star (television's &quot;Melrose Place&quot;)comes this excellent, witty, and energetic series of four girlfriends living in New York City and exploring the topic that was once exclusively for men when it came to conversation, &quot;sex.&quot;  Based on the bestselling book by Candace Bushnell, &quot;Sex and the City&quot; revolves around the lives of four young, urban professional in search of the perfect relationship and orgasm.Sarah Jessica Parker (&quot;Honeymoon in Vegas&quot; ; &quot;LA Story&quot;) plays Carrie Bradshaw, a weekly columnist for a local paper, who writes a column regarding sex and relationships in the big city. Kim Catrall (&quot;Masquerade&quot;; &quot;Mannequin&quot;) is Samantha,  a big time publicist. Cynthia Nixon (&quot;The Out-of-Towners&quot;-1999 version) plays Miranda, a lawyer and Kristin Davis Plays Charlotte, an art gallery curator who is a bit prudish when it comes to sex.When these four Manhattanites get together, they do cause a commotion in whatever they do, and on this two-disc set, HBO Video treats viewers with the first twelve episodes of the popular new series where anything (and mostly everything) goes.The episodes which explore such topics as monogamy, threesomes, baby showers, and other topics that normal to the everyday denizen of a large metropolitan mecca such as New York contain the most wittiest scripts and scenarios that I have ever seen on television. Due to the lack of network censors, &quot;Sex and the City&quot; popularity thrives on its' ability to use profanity, sex, nudity, and other adult themes that are taboo on broadcast stations.The show also contains other delightful character that win will you over as a new fan. Chris Noth (television's &quot;Law &amp; Order&quot;) is always excellent in whatever role he takes, and as Carrie's love interest , &quot;Mr. Big&quot;, he will swoon you with his charm and elegance. And what would the average heterosexual girl living in the big city be without her gay best friend? In Carrie's case, her best gay friend, Stanford, is her very own Rupert Everett. His tales of dating in the gay scene, in addition to his flamboyance will cause you to both have pity and amusement for this funny sidekick.While this show will mainly appeal to urban women and gay men, it should be viewed and enjoyed by all. With all the recent network rip-offs airing on television already (e.g. UPN's &quot;Girlfriends&quot;), I can guarantee it would be worth your time and money to purchase this series and enjoy what can be called the most original television comedy in recent years at home.The DVD edition contains a great motion main menu powered by a flavorful salsa beat, and some of the special features on the set include DVD-Rom web links to related sites, a behind-the-scenes look at the making of the series, episode previews, language selection (English and Spanish tracks), and subtitles (English and French subtitles).I am anxiously awaiting the second season to be released on DVD.

However, it does  have some impact here, but it is used too straightfowardly (there is little  deception from the media) to be truly effective.The story revolves  around a group of preppy rich kids from Buenos Aires (yeah right) and the  journey from teenagedom to responsible citizens.

Excellent cast here with Harrison Ford in the title role, who gives the character the realism and depth needed to pull a challenging film like this off. Also in the cast is Tommy Lee Jones who is equally excellent as the ruthless cop on the trail of Ford and also Sela Ward, Joe Pantoliano and Julianne Moore.Keith Barish and Arnold Ropelson pull off this thriller triumphantly. Its a real winner! A classic masterpiece which earnt Tommy Lee Jones an oscar for Best Actor. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!!!!!",The Fugitive

6870,"Okay. Starship Troopers is a parody of a war film, about a quasi-facist future Earth in which people's lives are confetti, and duty to the state is everything. The point is nicely made, but just isn't enough for a fairly  long movie. Which is what causes the problems.Because after about half  an hour, Verhoeven suddenly realises, &quot;Drat, I'm stuck with this  now.&quot; And the film deteriorates into a pretty silly special-effects  showcase. Entertaining, but mindless. And the satirical point is at risk,  because when the film ends, you've forgotten how it began.Nice touches  include stunning SFX and clever casting, wherein gorgeous, ridiculously  handsome models get torn up by ugly bugs, thus parodying the action movie  type. But soon enough Starship Troopers has BECOME what it parodies. Shame,  because for a while it was really onto something.",N/A
482390,"At first, I thought that this movie would not be taut and original as the others.  When I watched it, I was surprised.  The movie contained all the elements of a good sequel.  It contained the traditional high body count,  suspense, and and black humor.The story is about Sidney Prescott,  who now goes by another name.  Her life is okay, but someone begins to  stalk her once again in a deadly game of cat and mouse.  Meanwhile, a movie  called Stab 3 is in production.  Before the movie is finished, a murderer  begins to stalk the ones involved in the movie one by one.  With each  victim, the killer leaves behind a clue.Gale Wethers, who is now a  major celebrity, teams with Dewwy to catch the cunning killer.  As they get  closer and closer to the truth, they realize that Sidney has a connection  to the carnage, and she may be the next victim.With a twist or turn  at every corner, the movie is guaranteed to leave you on the edge of your  seat.  It may have a high body count, but there is very little gore  involved in the deaths.  It is loaded with action and heart pounding chases  between predator and prey.  The cast gives a wonderful performance and the  script is well written.  Humor is placed in the right places and so is the  violence.  You would keep your eyes glued to the television screen until  the shocking climax.  I would recommend this to anyone who likes  suspenseful sequels.",Scream 3

Matthew Perry provides some excellent slapstick and does not come across as a Chandler clone at all.

Success has not spoiled Sayles.&quot;Limbo&quot; surprised and pleased  me at every turn.  All the characters, from bit parts to the principals,  are sensitively and accurately written.  Sayles never fails to get a little  scathing social commentary into the picture, and his throwaway dialogue  about the Disney-fication of Alaska is true enough to hurt.You could  call &quot;Limbo&quot; the antithesis of Lone Star.  In Lone Star, one  protagonist reassures the other at the end, &quot;Forget the Alamo,&quot;  meaning that we can cut free from our past and live for the present;  in  Limbo, all the characters are marked and haunted by their history,  especially Strathairn's leading man (a remarkably appealing bit of  acting).I was angry with Sayles, like many viewers, at the end [warning,  spoilers!] -- so much suspense has been painstakingly developed, and then,  agh, you never know whether these characters, about whom you have come to  care deeply, will survive.  However, I respect his decision to avoid a  cliche in either possible resolution.&quot;Limbo&quot; is quite simply  unforgettable, and a reminder that cinema doesn't have to be noisy and  stupid, or exclusively focussed on pretty young people, to be fine and  memorable.

The songs, the  music, and the singing are fantastic. Everything else is strung onto Elvis  like strings of popcorn around a Christmas tree.Not all Elvis films  are this good. What makes this one better are the glossy production values;  and the letterbox print definitely helps. Angela Lansbury puts in a highly  amusing performance as Elvis's ditzy Southern Belle mama (after all, Hawaii  is the southernmost state, no?). The whole story hinges around Elvis's  return from the military and his desire to return to his cozy beach bum  existence, while mater and pater want him to join the family pineapple  firm.The King, of course, is subject to no law. He goes into the tour  guide business, marshalling a well-preserved teacher and her four teenage  charges around the islands. His Franco-Hawaiian girlfriend is jealous that  there's more than tourism going on behind closed doors.At the end,  everything comes together.

Well, maybe Dellamorte (Rupert Everett) isn't illiterate, but  he's awfully close to it. He's only read two books. Okay, so he's only read  one, and it was a phone book, but that doesn't stop him from pontificating  whilst blowing away the living dead.There are lots of grody bits to keep  you entertained: buckets of fake blood, peeping tom ignis fatuus (okay,  flaming cotton balls suspended from obvious strings), and rotting boy  scouts. There are also plot twists which will bend your brain, like the  ever-present Dellamore. Dellamorte looks like a classic Boris Vallejo  model, and Dellamore looks like a hunky Boris Karloff. The dialogue is  hilarious, and the cinematography superb. Maybe the director resorted to  using fake flies in the death scenes (in retrospect, I'm sure this was  intentional), but he spared nothing in his camera work!

So, when my wife rented a copy of the 1999 remake of &quot;The Thomas Crown Affair,&quot; (the original being that 1968 classic heist film starring Steve McQueen and Faye Dunaway), I found myself predisposed to return it the video store unwatched. That, despite the fact that everything I had previously heard about the movie made it sound pretty good! Reluctantly, I decided to go ahead and sit through it...and am I ever glad I did!Thomas Crown, is a man who has it all. He's a smart, sophisticated Wall Street financier, worth multi-billions of dollars. He owns his own holding company, a New York skyscraper, and a gorgeous town house filled with art treasures. He has everything a man could ask for...except a challenge in life. He's bored. And he's always on the lookout for the ultimate thrill...In order to find that greatest of all thrills, he enlists a little help from a trio of Eastern European accomplices and pulls off a daring daytime theft of a priceless painting from a New York art museum.Enter Catherine Banning, an insurance investigator for &quot;a couple of guys from Zurich who don't want to just write a 100 million dollar check&quot; for the stolen painting. She's just as smart, sophisticated, and savvy as Crown, and equally eager for the next great challenge, the ultimate thrill. She immediately suspects that Crown is the mastermind behind the theft, and she will stop at nothing to get that painting back...including seducing her prime suspect. Soon, Crown and Banning find themselves collision course of sex, suspicion, ambition, jealousy, and betrayal......I won't give away any more of the plot. It is sufficient to say that the movie takes many a suspenseful and enjoyable twist and turn on its way to a surprisingly unpredictable outcome.Needless to say, I was very pleasantly surprised at the quality of &quot;The Thomas Crown Affair.&quot; In fact, I thought it was as good as the 1968 McQueen/Dunaway version. It is a taut, suspenseful film tinged with humor and wit The acting is good throughout. Renee Russo dominates the film with her splendid performance as the canny and sensual insurance investigator. Pierce Brosnan's portrayal of Thomas Crown is good, but certainly less intense and satisfying than Russo's characterization of Banning. The chemistry between Russo and Brosnan is enhanced by sharp, witty dialogue and the highly sensual scenes shared by these two attractive actors. However, their on-screen chemistry tended to suffer on a few occasions, when Brosnan seemed almost passive next to Russo. Denis Leary was excellent in his role as the highly intelligent and sensitive police detective Mike McCann, as was Faye Dunaway in her cameo appearance as Thomas Crown's therapist.At the end of a Friday evening of movie watching, with the ending credits of 1999's &quot;The Thomas Crown Affair&quot; beginning to roll, I had to admit: my wife had really picked out a very good movie this time!

It is not an action packed movie that would rumble your house with it's base and keep all the  neighbors on their toes. Rather this movie shows the suttle bond between a  brother and sister and it's growth through one of their daily hardships. I  should add that the director is in no hurry either to show this.  A movie  with some depth to it needs to be at a so called &quot;slow pace&quot;  inorder for the viewer to absorb and comprehend the ideas and thoughts that  are being introduced to them.If you like to watch a movie alone or  with a small crowd of patient viewers you will come out of this movie with  a big smile on your face and a happier heart :),The White Balloon VHS

The standard Vampyre-hunter van  Helsing has been left out this time and personally I didn't miss him. The  scene where Dracula is revived from his ashes with help of a little blood  is downright spectacular and Christopher Lee gives an excellent performance  as the not so dead count. Good camera work, a thrilling score and good  performances from the entire cast make this a fine contribution to the  horror scene.",N/A
546285,"I admit it, I watched JEM back in its heyday (or perhaps even a little afterward as my memories of it are the reruns on USA).  It was the glitz, glam and excess of the 80s wrapped up into a glamorous hot pink package that makes an army of Barbie dolls look mudane and typical in comparision.  Jem was like Rock Star Barbie, and the episodes for this series generally revolved around concerts, fashion, making music videos and hot sports cars, and of course the Vixen crossed with Taylor Dayne, dance inducing electric edged pop rock music that went along with it.She-Ra provided little girls of the 80s with a strong female heroine to look up to for their fantasy otherworldly fix, while JEM provided the &quot;I wanna be a rock star&quot; fantasy rolled up into made for tv animation.  It wasn't brilliance but it was definitely a nice fix for weekday afternoons.  Want to relive the nostalgia? Well here you go.",N/A
478547,"&quot;Being John Malkovich&quot; is a revelation.  Of course this movie  isn't loved by all; but such gems that jumpstart a new wave of creativity  rarely reach universal popularity.  The first thing I thought of when I  heard about this movie was &quot;Anything this off the wall has to be  good.&quot;  The second thing I thought was &quot;Hey!  I didn't know we  could do that.&quot;  I mean, what a startling idea.  This movie really  pioneers a new genre: I call it &quot;reali-fantasy.&quot;  People  steer away from this film because they find it too bizarre.  But the sad  truth is that the oddities in this film are just warped fun house mirrors  to our own lives.  Afterall, the only happy, sucessful character in this  film is Maxine; a cold, calculating, me-first-screw-everybody-else type.  The honest people just striving for their dreams are miserable.  Craig  wants to be a successful puppetteer.  Lottie simply wants to be a mother.  It is apparent that they will not be reaching these goals at the outset of  the film.Doesn't that just ring a little too true?How do they distract themselves?  Why, by becoming John Malkovich.  This  says another thing about our society; to distract ourselves from our  miserable lives we focus on celebrities.  We use them up, and when we are  done with them, leave them on the side of the road.This film is at  one moment utterly hilarious and all too depressing the next.  It truly is  a rollercoaster.  But with a story this enthralling, it is a ride you are  more than willing to take.John Malkovich delivers the greatest  performance of his career.  He doesn't only play John Malkovich, he also  plays the other characters that enter his mind so believably that you have  no problem believing that Craig Schwarftz is really controlling.John Cusack seems top be the only performer who didn't get any publicity  for this film.  That is really sad because his performance is so sublime  and strong.  After all, he is the sun of this film's universe.  If he  weren't as bright as he is the others would fall into despair apart.&quot;Being John Malkovich&quot; is a new film for the new millenium.  It  is perfect frame by frame.  I reccomend this film for everyone.  At least  try it.  You might like it, you might not, but you'll have to admit that  you've never seen anything like this before.  If only every film could be  such an innovation.",N/A
41495,"Don Siegel at his best was a creative and brilliant director capable of turning out tense, gripping and intelligent entertainment...and &quot;Invasion of the Body Snatchers&quot; is Siegel in his finest form !!Kevin McCarthy, in arguably his best performance, is sensational as small town doctor, Miles Bennell who returns from a trip to find the residents of Santa Mira strangely afflicted by an unusual malady that makes them believe that their loved ones are....strange imposters...lacking in emotion, warmth and soul. But is it really an unidentified illness sweeping the town, or something far more sinister ?? The evidence points towards a strange alien life form infiltrating their small community and Siegel mounts the terror step by terrifying step. Before long, Miles and his girlfriend Becky Driscoll (Dana Wynter) find themselves in the minority as the frightening epidemic of &quot;body snatching&quot; sweeps through Santa Mira like a brush fire, turning loved friends into souless adversaries. Much has been written about the McCarthy-ism aspects of this movie, so I won't dwell on that point, other than to say that &quot;Invasion&quot; escalates paranoia to a crescendo !With a spine tingling musical score, brilliant cinematography (especially the creative use of lighting) and a talented cast  that work in wonderful synergy together, &quot;Invasion&quot; still remains a benchmark in how to make a chilling science-fiction film.This much awaited DVD widescreen release even includes an interview with star, Kevin McCarthy and original theatrical trailers as an added bonus !An important, absorbing and influential film that remains one of the key release's of the decade of the 1950's !",N/A

Now that I've gotten older, I can appreciate the more obscure jokes, and  that's really at the heart of this movie, and others made by the  Abrahams/Zucker team: although &quot;Top Secret&quot; appears low-brow on  the surface, the humor really depends on the viewer being at least  moderately educated.

It  took me several hours to even speak- literally even speak- after seeing it  with friends of mine who bawled uncontrollably throught 90% of this epic.  It was days before I could even tell people that I saw it.I have seen  CITIZEN KANE; I have seen CASABLANCA; I have seen E.T.; ALL ABOUT EVE; THE  GODFATHER; APOCAPSYE NOW; Olivier's OTHELLO; IT'S A WONDERFUL LIFE; and so  on, and so on... this is the greatest movie I have ever seen; bar none.  I  never knew the love a father has for his wife and son could be portrayed so  incredibly, in the context of prevailing against the ultimate evil and  madness.  It's European way of refusing to tell you how to feel, but  allowing you to witness the uncontrollable flood of your own emotions as  you bare witness to that which is most frightening and most beautiful in  being human just has to be seen to be understood- there are no superlatives  I can think of that could do it justice.This movie has changed me,  and changed the way I see the entire art form of cinema- its value to  society, and the possibility of its capacity to reveal truth.I have  not seen the dubbed version, and I would suggest to any who have not seen  this in the theatres to find the version with English subtitles.  Dubbbed  films, in sacrificing so much in the translation, tend to muffle the soul  of the actors' perfomance; to big a price to pay, I believe, for the  convenience of not having to look down and read while looking up and  experiencing this in its purest, most complete sense.As far as I am  concerned, this is the greatest movie ever made.",Life Is Beautiful La Vita E Bella  VHS
89384,"Neil Jordan's Michael Collins is a fast paced intelligent work about a  early twentieth century Irish poltical activist and military leader. The  film has romance, pace, action, wit and humour. Neil Jordan is probably one  of the best script writers in terms of quantity and quality of product now  working in world cinema. It's his intelligence and unique way of seeing a  situation I find is refreshing. Dressing up a future President of Ireland  of Ireland disguised as a whore is witty and fair comment on the corruption  in politics in Ireland at the moment. Taking up the story of Michael  Collins after a failed rebellion in Dubllin, Ireland, against British  Imperial rule at the time, 1916, Jordan quickly introduces the characters  of the film. Harry Boland, a Dub amusingly played by Aidan Quinn (Fans of  Quinn can see him also in the fine This is my Father which he made with his  brothers) Eamonn De Valera, a political intellectual leader of the  republican movement well caricatured by Alan Rickman, and Kitty Kiernan,  played by Julia Roberts in a performance which will steal your heart. A  fine supporting cast led by english actor Ian Hart gives this film top  quality drama. The performance of Liam Neeson in the role of Collins is one  of the best of his career so far with the flair of his Oscar Schindler  character and the strength of Collins Cork origins mixed with poignant  reflective moments, this is terrific natural playing.Basically the story  is of Collins out-witting the British administration and winning a  negotiated settlement. A lot of Collins' characteristics are picked up in  the movie. His cycling around Dublin under the very noses of the security  forces, his playing with De Valera's children and wrestling with whoever  was about as a bit of a joke. Unlike the revolutionary leaders who are said  to have copied Collins, like Mao Tse Tung and Ho Chi Minh etc., Collins was  more likely to say &quot;are you on for a pint ?&quot; than any guff about  the good of the movement. His tactical talent and strategic skills are  shown but his skill at managing the large amounts of intelligence  information isn't as well appreciated in the film. His realization that a  republic was better forged under steady transition, and more logically  needed to be worked out as to its practical meaning, was a foundation stone  of the current Irish state. Further his belief that a democratic decision,  a popular vote, was the crux of any situation and to be defended despite  any loyalties to the contrary. This latter point is made dramatically in  the film as Collins and Boland find themselves on opposite sides having  been pals. (For more information on Collins try Tim Pat Coogan's  &quot;Michael Collins&quot;, a better read is  &quot;De Valera&quot; by the  same author.)",N/A

Although the subject matter may not be the most uplifting or flattering to American history, the excellent writing and finely crafted performance duly compensate.  Daniel Day-Lewis, Joan Allen, and Winona Ryder are at the top of their game, commanding attention, pathos, pity, admiration, both for their characters and for their deeply-layered work.  However, the supporting cast does not falter, either.  Rob Campbell is genuinely affecting as compassionate Reverend Hale, while Paul Scofield infuriates and fascinates as the unbending judge who begins to question his own judgment as the movie nears its climax.Credit must also be given to the fabulous Arthur Miller, whose contribution to contemporary American drama is matched only by a few.  His screenplay is finely-tuned, clever, and evocative, and makes the same impact today as it did in the 1950's.  Nicholas Hytner's direction displays his mastery of the craft, and deserves recognition as well.But perhaps the greatest merit of the play is that despite the standout performances, excellent writing, and superior direction, the message of the story still shines through.",N/A

225869,"I hate to sound that pretentious about a Ridley Scott film but I'm afraid that I have to in this case. This picture is a surefire way to feel more cosy no mater where you're watching from. There are two ways to break this  film down, the first being as the primary entry in a trilogy. On that  level, 'Alien' knocks the stuffing out of 'Aliens' by a superior approach  ('Alien 3' has been kicked around enough so I won't add to its misery here  by rubbing in the iodine) to the subject. The first film relied  wholeheartedly on tricks found only in the horror school whereas the latter  snowballed into a multi-story car park of blood, bullets and bravado. To  say that 'Alien' moves too slowly is an idiosyncratic peeve....the movie  utilizes this build-up to its advantage (you relish the terror sequences  more once you've had the luxury of becoming a little bored) while  preserving a realism that James Cameron just couldn't capture in his more  soporific magnum opus. There's just no symbolism in 'Alien' to make it  something it's not: it's just a straightforward space thriller presented on  such a slow-moving vehicle that you can't appreciate what your going  through until you watch it for the second or third time. To be sure, there  is much borrowed from Fifties 'B' certificates, but that matter is so  minute that it doesn't even register when put on the scales opposite what  this pic has going for it. Good direction, state of the art SFX (the horror  element in 'Alien' kept parallels with 'Star Wars' from being drawn in the  same way that you're not allowed to compare the architecture of  Transylvania to that of Disneyland), the use of a nondescript cast (come  on, people - what had John Hurt actually done of note prior to this?) as  well as the aforementioned protraction of plot development make for one  killer movie. This is a film about hunting and a film about hiding with you  on the hiding side, the slow areas only serving to heighten the tension as  surely as if you were lost in a video game. Get it now and wonder how you  went for so long without it.",Alien VHS

60324,"Fletch is my personal favorite comedy and without a doubt, one of the funniest movies ever made.  Chevy Chase is perfectly cast as Irwin Fletcher, a wise cracking newspaper reporter working undercover on a beach to expose a drug running operation.  At the same time, he is mistaken for a junkie by  shady millionare Alan Stanwyk (Tim Matheson) who asks Fletch to murder him.  Fletch agrees but launches an investigation into finding out why this man wants to be killed.  This isn't lowbrow humor, it's quick witted and very fast.  Fletch requires a few viewings before one is able to grab all the jokes, but it's well worth it.  I've seen this movie about 30 times and each and every time I watch, it remains as funny as the first time I saw it.  If you've liked Chevy Chase in Caddyshack or National Lampoon's Vacation, than you'll love him here.  The dialogue is witty and extremely quotable.  Chase's Fletch often disguises himself as he investigates the two mysteries, his cheap disguises and alias' (Ted Nugent, Don Corleone, Dr. Rosenpenis) are hysterical, Chase is a master of deadpan wisecracks, this movie is a perfect showcase for his talent.Aside from the brilliance of Fletch as a comedy, Fletch functions perfectly as a well made mystery movie.  I disagree with one reviewer who praised the movie as a comedy but said it wasn't a very good movie.  Fletch is a very good movie and aside from Chevy Chase, there are many other reasons for the success of this classic.  Screenwriter Andrew Bergman has written one of the trickiest scripts in Hollywood history, it manages to be flat out hilarious, and captivating in the same light.  Whenever I watch this film with a new viewer, they are always surprised as to how much the storyline grabbed them.  Another plus with this movie is Harold Faltermeyer's superb synthesizer score. It's similar to his earlier Beverly Hills Cop score, maybe even better, it helps set the tone of this movie perfectly.  Last but not least, we have the direction, all under the sure hand of Michael Ritchie.  He keeps things moving and maintains a comedic tone which occasionally borders on seriousness to help the story progress. Balancing tones isn't easy, in this film it's done so well, it's hardly even noticable.Fletch is all around, an excellent film, but before everything else, it's a VERY funny film.  A true cult classic.  For audiences whom have seen Beverly Hills Cop, think along those lines, I always thought it would be amusing to see what would happen if Chase's Fletch met with Eddie Murphy's Axel Foley of the Cop films.  If you've seen those than you have a good idea of what to expect with Fletch, a film loaded with belly laughs as long as you're willing to pick up on them.",N/A

Posey's brother brings home his fiance, played by Tori Spelling, to meet his mother and twin sister, played by Posey. He has not been home for years, and his mother nurtures the unnatural, sexual relationship between brother and sister. Posey instantly dislikes Tori so much that she goes out of her way to berate, insult, and undermine her at every turn without her brother interceding  and all against the background of a dark, stormy night (a cliched movie theme).

507264,"Note: this review refers to the 14-DVD boxed set and not just to Volume 1.No film buff and certainly no film major should be without the boxed set of 14 DVDs that Laserlight has issued under the umbrella title of &lt;The Alfred Hitchcock Collection&gt;. The DVDs are organized in no particular order, some containing only one film, some two, while two of them have a full film and an episode from the old &quot;Alfred Hitchcock Presents&quot; TV series of the 1950s. They all have a trailer of more recent Hitchcock films and they all have an embarrassingly bad introduction by Tony Curtis, whose connection with these films and with English enunciation is vague at best.The gems of the collection are &quot;The Man Who Knew Too Much&quot; (1934), &quot;The 39 Steps&quot; (1935) and &quot;The Lady Vanishes&quot; (1939). Of the earlier talkies, &quot;Young and Innocent&quot; has the quintessential plot of an innocent man and a girl who somehow winds up with him being chased by the police. &quot;Rich and Strange&quot; (1932) is not a thriller but has a shivery sequence as a couple on a sinking boat sees the water seeping into their cabin--just before it stops sinking.&quot;Jamaica Inn&quot; (1939) has an over the top performance by Charles Laughton (whose dialogue is hard to follow even on this restored version) and the first appearance of Maureen O'Hara. And for once, Robert Newton plays the Good Guy. &quot;Sabotage&quot; (1936) is based on a Joseph Conrad tale and has the famous scene of the boy on a bus with a bomb on his lap. (Later, Hitchcock commented he should not have let it go off.) &quot;Secret Agent&quot; (1936) gives us a young John Gielgud as a spy who kills the wrong man, Peter Lorre in a very bizarre role (helped or hindered by his drug-taking on and off the set), and the suavest villain of them all--Robert Young!&quot;Number 17&quot; (1932) is one of the films Hitchcock did not want to film, and he gave us a great spoof on the genre of the spooky houses, diamond smugglers, and derring-do. &quot;Murder&quot; (1930) boasts a super cool Herbert Marshall as a jurist who reluctantly says guilty at a woman's murder trial and then spends the rest of the film proving her innocent.More fascinating is &quot;Blackmail&quot; (1929), which existed in silent and talking versions. We have the latter and the often commented upon scene in which Hitchcock plays with the soundtrack so that only the word &quot;knife&quot; can be heard during the last part of a long monologue. Another trick he was forced into was the use of a British actress reading out the lines of the foreign-born heroine.&quot;The Skin Game&quot; (1931) is weakest of the talkies included in this set; and indeed the dialogue is almost impossible to understand.Of the silents, &quot;The Lodger&quot; (1927) is in the worst shape but it shows very clearly the influence of the silent German film on Hitchcock's early (and later) technique. Of course the long takes of a face staring into the camera are laughable today; but this is an historical document and demands a certain degree of detachment. &quot;The Ring&quot; (1927) does strain credibility, while it shows Hitchcock's love for show business of any sort, even circus freakshows and boxing.&quot;The Manxman&quot; (1929) is slow and predictable with its love triangle, a misreported death, and the return of the husband. &quot;Easy Virtue&quot; (1927) is based on a Noel Coward play, which it follows only half way through the film, and shows a sympathetic view of the &quot;woman with a past&quot;--in this case, a divorce--together with a condemnation of those who cannot accept her. More Social Studies than good drama here.However, &quot;The Farmer's Wife&quot; (1928) is quite funny once the somewhat jerky widower offers himself to three unlikely women while his housekeeper loves him in silence and has to assist him in his wooing spree.One feature of these DVDs you will probably not need is the ability to hear the talkies in English, Spanish, Chinese or Japanese; or to subtitle the dialogue cards in the silents in the last three languages.A strange feature of these DVDs is that they immediately take you into the film rather than into the menu. This should be changed in future printings.So all in all, I would guess you would want to see some of the talkies many, many times, some of the silents less often, and some of them never again. But once more, this is a very valuable set for students and just plain lovers of film history, especially the part played in that history by Hitchcock.",Alfred Hitchcock - The Collection: (The 39 Steps / Jamaica Inn / Young and Innocent / The Manxman / The Secret Agent / and more)
332517,"Stanley Kubrick's visionary masterpiece remains fascinating and compelling even today.  Though as one reviewer stated the plot and symbolism are purposely subtle, this only compounds my interest in the film.  I love the  fact that it creates a feeling, a mood and a universe of possibilities way,  way before its time -- every detail is surprising, and you best take  nothing for granted.  As a child, the monoliths terrified me -- today,  those big black sheets of metal remain ominous but also astound me and  leave me in awe.  I think this Kubrick's best movie, because it envisioned  a world that had never existed before.  The opening sequence with the dawn  of man still confounds me -- how many of them were real apes, because that  is the best darn ape makeup I have ever seen.  And the use of classical  music throughout was a stroke of brilliance -- the images match the music  beat for beat, not just in terms of choreography, but in terms of their  visionary quality, timeless and sublime.",N/A

It has fantastic costume designs, great special fx for it's time, superb performance from the entire cast and a rocking soundtrack by Toto. But i still feel the DVD deserves better. The running time was many times shorter than the theatrical release. There was even a three hour plus DVD version of the movie available only in the U.K. For most part, the U.K release(Extended TV Edition)was better although it was toned down a bit but it improves a lot in the drama, plot and characters' development. Hopefully, Universal will bring the extended version to U.S shores or at least a director's cut of the film. In the audio/visual departments, this is still the best version without any sign of grain but picture tends to be soft at certain areas(the special fx areas)due to the age of the film.

But heck...in the movie they turn the lights off first, so nobody could see anything...well at least that's what they think!!  In one of my personal favorite movies, Joan plays rich deb Bonnie Jordan, who after the loss of her family's fortune, must go to work like everyone else.  While Bonnie becomes a cub reporter on the local newspaper, her brother Rodney becomes a bootlegger to an ultra rotten  mobster, played by the one and only Clark Gable.  Bonnie's assignment to discover who murdered the newspaper's leading reporter leads her to a shocking discovery.Things to take note of:  1)Joan uses a metallic blow drier on board the yacht that looks almost exactly like the blow driers we use today!  2)Attitudes towards cigarettes sure have changed!

398951,"One of the best of Fritz Lang's American movies - a thriller with the logic and plausibility of a nightmare.  Lang's technique is so sure and so seductive that the viewer completely identifies with the safe, serene protagonist (Edward G. Robinson), an associate professor of psychology in a New York City college, and shares his shock and fear when he's caught in a trap.  The professor is interested in the relation of motive to homicide - an interest that's purely a matter of intellectual curiosity.  Then, when his wife and child are out of town, he visits a woman's apartment; her lover comes in and unexpectedly attacts him, and he kills the intruder with a pair of scissors..............

125185,"Of the three Tom Clancy novels made into films, &quot;Patriot Games&quot; disappoints the most. Based on one of the least of Clancy's novels, the film is about Ex-CIA analyst / Ex-Marine Jack Ryan, who interferes with an  Irish terrorist attack on a member of the Royal family at the beginning of  the film and quickly becomes a target himself- matching wits with the  radical group as they plot another hit, this time on Ryan's family.  Harrison Ford (Ryan) seems to be still feeling his way through the role  Alec Baldwin almost certainly regrets abandoning after 1990's &quot;Hunt  for Red October&quot;. I liked Sean Bean's performance as the terrorist  obsessed with evening up the score with Jack Ryan, but few others stand out  (unlike &quot;Red October&quot;). The plot fails to move much- Ryan is too  busy reacting to events.Clancy fans will enjoy. Dunno about everyone  else.",N/A

See it knowing as little aspossible, I saw this film totally cold and really enjoyed it and wastotally surprised. I think it's easily the best film I've seen in thelast ten years.....The casting andacting is exceptional. The highlight of the film is the line-up scenewhich is really funny (the director filmed the scene a number of timesand chose the best take) but the film as a whole is of a very highstandard and will keep you guessing until the end.....Kevin Spacey is brilliant and did win an Academy Award for hisrole but everyone else is just as exceptional. Particular attentionshould be paid to Stephen Baldwin who finally found a role and a moviethat can really demonstrate that his talent. As the hyperactiveMcManus who knows no fear and has some of the best dialogue in thefilm to boot.There isn't a weak link in the film and the 5 actorswho are &quot;the usual suspects&quot; convey exceptionally a groupwho find themselves trapped into a job that is seemingly unachievablebut come agonisingly close to carrying out the impossible.

477199,"What surprised me most about THE 4D MAN was the script. The characters are very well-defined, strong, logical, consistent and nicely developed, and the performers play the parts admirably. Above-average characterization is  not usually something you'll find in a minor sci-fi thriller! Director  Irvin S Yeaworth Jr is better known for THE BLOB, a movie that also boasts  an above-average character in Steve Andrews (Steve McQueen). Perhaps not  surprisingly, both films were co-written by Theodore Simonson (his only  film credits). It's almost a shame Simonson didn't do more film work.THE  PLOT: Tony Nelson (James Congdon), the younger brother of research  scientist Scott Nelson (Robert Lansing), is attempting to duplicate a lab  accident in which he passed a pencil through a thick plate of steel. The  brothers eventually team up but it transpires that the original accident  was caused mainly by the influence of abnormally high brainwave activity.  Scott's coincidental suffering of headaches induced by powerful brainwave  impulses triggers another accident in which his hand passes through a solid  plate of a newly-invented impenetrable metal. Soon Scott can pass through  anything just by exercising his willpower, but the ability comes with a  price. He grows older with each effort, and can only rejuvenate himself by  stealing the life from others. Soon people are found dead of extreme old  age...even if they were young. It's up to Tony and their mutual girlfriend  Linda Davis (Lee Meriwether) to stop Scott who is slowly going mad.The  effects are decent for their time. I remember FAMOUS MONSTERS OF FILMLAND  magazine had a contest (or maybe the studio sponsored it) challenging  people to duplicate the abilities of the 4D MAN! The acting is good, as I  mentioned, but Robert Lansing in the lead role is terrific, his performance  is wonderful to watch. It's worth viewing the film just to see Lansing, he  really is incredible.For some reason (maybe seeing stills in FAMOUS  MONSTERS) I always envisioned this movie was in black and white, but it is  in color. The DVD's image quality is very good, perhaps a little grainy but  probably normal for its age (the film was released in 1959). There are no  extras on the disc; the main menu is the scene selection. The sound is  fine, but that brings me to the most unfortunate aspect of the movie - the  music. Completely inappropriate, the loud, brash jazzy music is remarkably  distracting and thoroughly annoying. I couldn't help thinking how much  better the movie would be with a score by someone like Bernard Herrmann or  Dimitri Tiomkin instead of Ralph Carmichael!Add this up: a believable  story, outstanding acting from the lead, above-average characterization,  okay special effects, better makeup effects and terribly inappropriate  music. The sum is a high recommendation for THE 4D MAN.",N/A

549856,"Is he cheating on her, or isn't he? Hope Davis (Mumford, Next Stop Wonderland) plays a young wife who inadvertantly discovers a letter in her husband Stanley Tucci's jacket pocket.  The letter implies the husband may  have a love interest outside his marriage.  Ms. Davis inadvertantly informs  a family member who lets the cat out of the bag to other family members and  soon the whole family is involved and a judgement is reached that they will  pile into the family car and drive to New York City for the day on the off  chance they can &quot;catch him in the act&quot; of being unfaithful.The  action in this film consists of two conversations. The first conversation  involves the decision to drive to New York for the day, the second takes  place in the car on the trip into the city and afterward in New York.  I  wondered if the story wasn't originally a play, since it was heavy on (very  good) dialogue and the scene changes were limited.I knew only two of  the actors when I saw the film in the theatre--Ann Meara, who plays the mom  and  is a wonderful, overbearing, interfering mother looking after her  chick.  I believe in &quot;real life&quot; she is Ben Stiller's mom  (Something About Mary) and Jerry Stiller's wife (King of Hearts on TV). Ann  and Jerry were a comedy team on the TV variety shows in the 1970's--and,  Campbell Scott (George C. Scott's son). Campbell Scott is such a good  actor--and such a sleazy guy in this film you love to hate him.Like  other productions involving the talents of Stanly Tucci and Campbell Scott:  &quot;Big Night&quot;, &quot;The Imposters&quot;, and &quot;The Spanish  Prisoner&quot;, the film is low budget (sparse settings)+ wonderfully witty  dialogue + stylish actors and is supremely well done.

The reason I think of Allen when watching Brooks's work is because I  can't really think of another comedic film maker who is as witty. Brooks's  comedy is very verbal. And this movie has it's share of great one liners.  For instance in the very first scene we see Cybill Shepherd(Who is one of  many to make a cameo)presenting Brooks with a humanitarian of the year  award.

374830,"The Alamo: Thirteen Days to Glory is a significantly better representation of the historic battle than its better known namesake.  The production values are quite good, considering that a substantial amount of the  fighting during the siege, including the climactic final attack, were at  night, a fact accurately depicted in this film.There is still a good  deal of cliched heroism of dubious accuracy, and the acting is little more  than mediocre, but the producers and the director allow the event to be the  star of the show, minimizing the effect of these shortcomings.Somewhat  understated in tone and a bit slow to develop, the movie's seeming early  weakness becomes its greatest strength as the events slowly build to their  finale.  The final battle is brilliantly filmed, using a variety of camera  angles, quick cut-aways, and the blinding flashes of gunfire in the  pre-dawn darkness to give the viewer a sense of the confusion and terror  the befell the defenders during the terrifying attack.Thirteen Days to  Glory may not be Academy Award material, but it is a very noteworthy  attempt to accurately portray the events at the Alamo as they actually  happened.

38577,"First off, let me start by saying that this movie has one of the worst endings I have seen in a really long time, nothing is resolved.  Giovanni Ribisi has a ton of talent but it is wasted on this convoluted script which  has no direction and takes the viewer nowhere.  Ben Affleck is great as the  company's pitchman but his appearances are few and far between, as are Vin  Diesel's.  Nia Long's part is completely wasted and has no bearing on the  plot whatsoever.  The relationship between Ribisi and his father is  ridiculous.  So basically the only thing that makes this movie good is  watching these sharks in action.  The movie contains some great one-liners  and the action on the floor is key.  But overall, the narration is taken  right from Goodfellas 101 as is the camera work on some of the more violent  scenes.  I mean seriously any movie whose key quote was penned by the  Notorious BIG is trying really hard not to be taken seriously.",N/A

When the  film shifts focus to the adult Superman it falls into ridiculous slapstick  and destroys what could have been a fine example of classic film Americana.

522517,"The opening sequence of the movie sets the tone for the movie.  We are introduced to a buffed-up, shaggy-haired Tom Cruise climbing the vertical face of a rocky cliff in the middle of some barren landscape.  It is a beautiful, breath taking, death-defying ballet, but it is an entirely solo act.  The premise of the television series was that a group of skilled government operatives would be brought in based on their specialties and orchestrate a complex mission.  The first MI movie actually showed some of this spirit in the opening embassy sequence, but lost its steam as the complexity of the plot wore that movie out.MI:2 is basically all Tom Cruise all the time.  He drives, he fights, he dons disguise after disguise, he jumps, he kicks, he hides, and does all those things that action stars do.  Sure, there are a couple of support agents, but one is a glorified chauffeur, and the other just looks at a computer screen and looks worried.  The plot is standard action movie fare.  Bad guy, a former MI operative himself, wants to get his hands on a ultra-deadly toxin and its vaccine.  He plans to use it to demand billions from Australia, and the only one who can stop him is Mr. Cruise.  The key lies with a former lover of the villain.  A jewel thief, played by the beautiful Thandie Newton, she is recruited by Mr. Cruise, and they both promptly fall in love.  Much mayhem and destruction follow, as well as the predictable twists and turns, which climax in a mano-a-mano between hero and villain.The movie bears the hallmarks of the direction, noted Hong Kong action filmmaker John Woo.  There are the beautifully choreographed gun fights, the use of slow motion to enhance the drama and the mood of the characters, as well as the requisite doves flying in slow motion.  The special effects are par for the course, with plenty of explosions, bullets and locations that seemed to have been built for the sole purpose of being destroyed during gun fights.  One special effect that is particularly effective (until it is used for the upteenth time) is the removal of masks.  It is truly fantastic what a leap in technology we have from MI:1's mask removal sequence and MI:2's mask scenes.All in all, it is an average action movie that strays too far from the more cerebral Mission Impossible roots to land squarely in James Bond territory - there is even an M like character portrayed by Sir Anthony Hopkins.",N/A
516420,"Even though I knew the story after seeing the movie &quot;Boys Don't Cry&quot;, I am glad I saw this video. The facts of the case, especially the actual words that the sheriff used to interrogate Brandon after the  rape, were absolutely appalling and display the ignorance and prejudice of  the people in the small town of 5000, known for its dead-end jobs and  domestic violence.Now that I've seen both versions of this story, I must  say I preferred Boys Don't Cry with its scripted performance and planned  dramatic tension.  It also was able to portray some of the more intimate  moments with a sense of humor, such as the scene in which he gets a period  and steals tampax from a convenience store.  Scenes like this are  impossible in a documentary of course.The strength of the documentary,  however, was being able to see the real people, not actors.  And real  photographs of the troubled Brandon.  The realization that this is the  truth, not fiction, adds an extra punch or horror to that sickening feeling  I felt when I saw the dramatized version.If the story intrigues you, as  it did me as well as the filmmakers, make sure not to miss this penetrating  true look at this horrible crime.

Not only is this film hysterical, but it's message of  overnight love is also very uplifting. Jack Lemmon's tender and moving  performance as the sweet-hearted Howard Brubaker really tugged me.

277849,"A friend of mine forced me to watch this film... the premise sounded stupid and I HATE sappy, stupid movies.  I was totally floored.  This is one of the funniest family films I have ever seen. This is not a modern-day  slapstick no-brainer comedy, but a reminiscent look into the simpler 1940s  when kids sat in front of the radio all night and dreamed of being  cowboys.Ralphie's (Peter Billingsley)  fantasy is to hold the Daisy  Brand Red-Ryder BB rifle in his hot little hands Christmas morning and his  life begins revolving around this fantasy as the holiday approaches. He  practices using the rifle with his hands, writes a school essay about it  and pesters everyone from his parents to Santa Claus to make sure it's  delivered under the chimney no later than December 24.Don't be misled by  the director (famous for &quot;Porky's&quot;), this is a family film. There  is one expletive used, which quite frankly could have been snipped in my  opinion, but the overall feel of this film is one of innocence, adventure  and fond Christmas memories.  I watch this film every year and laugh myself  sick everytime I do.  Remembering the way we used to think and perceive  things as a child is what this movie is about, and how in many ways, much  of what we thought makes a lot more sense than how we think now.Darren  McGavin's performance provides some of the most hilarious laughs... he's  constantly shifting from being a grumpy old man to a little kid in his  emotional rollercoaster ride of mid-life crisis and fatherhood in the  1940s.I can't recommend this film enough. My only regret is the lack of  extras on the DVD. How about an interview w/ the cast, especially now that  the kids have grown? How about out-takes?

186651,"LAST YEAR AT MARIENBAD is unique in so many ways that it is difficult to  know where to start to describe it. Perhaps the most fruitful is to note  that it is certainly one of the most elegantly crafted films ever made. A  former editor, director Alain Resnais's work always has a peerless sense of  rhythm; his images seem to dance effortlessly across the screen. He is  helped considerably here by his cinematographer, Sacha Vierny (perhaps  better known now for his collaborations with Peter Greenaway), who bathes  the film in a soft, opalescent light. (The glacially smooth camera  movements anticipate the Steadicam by fifteen years.)Glowing in this  pearly light is designer Jacques Saulnier's vaguely disquieting and  ambivalently luxurious Rococo hotel. The film seamlessly combines locations  and sound stage sets into an all-embracing, chilly whole. The white walls,  gilded chinoiserie details and marble floors lend the film a candy-box  charm. Opening the box yields not sweet confections, however, but a nearly  claustrophobic totality, a fantasized projection entirely in keeping with  novelist Alain Robbe-Grillet's obsessive, repetitive writing. As the camera  glides down the immaculate hallways, it does not so much illustrate  Robbe-Grillet's text, or even build an environment in which it can be  recited, as create a visual equivalent to *listening to* a sinuously  rhythmed, incantatory, sentence like ""...le long de ces couloirs,-&agrave; travers  ces salons, ces galeries, dans cette construction d'un autre si&egrave;cle, cet  htel immense, luxueux, baroque,-lugubre, o&ugrave; des couloirs interminables,  succ&egrave;dent aux couloirs,...""I am not fluent in French, and I cannot  translate these lines. That is part of the point. You can enjoy MARIENBAD  without understanding the language. Indeed, it may be better if you do not,  since you are less likely to worry about what it ""means"" and to enjoy it  simply for its musical rhythm and texture. In fact, I strongly recommend  that you turn off the subtitles on your DVD and allow yourself to bask in  the film's rich aural tonalities.The filmmakers have no difficulty  involving us sensually, but they are indifferent to engrossing us  emotionally. While each of the principles is remarkably controlled, even  witty, their ""characterizations"" are flat and diagrammatic. The ""story"" of  MARIENBAD is our response to the film's unfolding. Sight, sound, texture,  voice and sensation are its real subject. For those willing to experience  it without prejudice, MARIENBAD is fantastically rewarding, ever-changing.  For those who insist on asking ""what does it mean?"" or ""did they or did  they not really meet last year?"" expect only confusion, frustration,  bafflement and disappointment.",N/A
245352,"On a drought-plagued farm somewhere in the southwest, spinster Lizzy Curry (Katharine Hepburn) has finally given up on ever being married, although her family wants to make one last effort with File (Wendell Corey), the local lawman.  Into their lives comes the fast talking con man Starbuck (Burt Lancaster), who promises that he can make it rain for $100.  More importantly, he can see the con job that Lizzy has played on herself and before he rides out of town he will have redeemed not only the shy spinster but himself.Katharine Hepburn was well into her period of playing spinsters by the time she made this 1956 film with Burt Lancaster. The idea of Hepburn and Lancaster making a film together is interesting since they had totally different approaches to the acting craft.  Hepburn would have the entire script memorized before shooting began whereas Lancaster preferred to learn his lines the night before. This is one of those films where the Bryn Mawr accent of the leading actress works against the character, but then the whole idea of Hepburn playing a rube--with costumes by Edith Head no less--is a bit of a stretch to start.  Lancaster really sinks his teeth into the role of the charming mountebank Starbuck.  Cameron Prud'Homme, Earl Hollliman and Lloyd Bridges play Lizzy's worried father and brothers, and it is they who really give the film its sense of life out on the farm more than the sets and scenery.Based on N. Richard Nash's play, the film was directed by Joseph Anthony, who had directed the stage version starring Geraldine Page (presumably an attempt to duplicate the success of Elia Kazan in moving from Broadway to Hollywood).  The story is still produced by community theaters as the musical &quot;110 in the Shade.&quot;  Hepburn received her seventh Oscar nomination for Best Actress for &quot;The Rainmaker&quot; (the winner that year was Ingrid Bergman for &quot;Anastasia&quot;), but the role of Lizzy Curry is not one of best performances.  Certainly Lizzy is becoming desperate, but Hepburn gives those scenes too much of an edge.  In her earlier films this worked quite well, most notably in &quot;Alice Adams,&quot; but in as a mature actress Hepburn was much more successful in underplaying the desperation of her spinster characters, as such did superbly the previous year in &quot;Summertime.&quot;  This may well be one of those regards in which it is simply difficult to separate the actress from the role.  However, in her strongest scenes she certainly brings dignity to the frightened spinster, and in the end you understand why she would actually pick Wendell Corey over Burt Lancaster.",The Rainmaker VHS

The Enterprise is studying violent geothermal activity on planets in the Selcundi Drema system.  While Wesley is put in charge of planetary mineral surveys, Data fiddles with the sensor array and comes across a radio transmission from a little girl on Drema IV named Sarjenka.

Suddenly this changes everything.What redeems this episode is the friendship between Data and Sarjenka, which is rather endearing.  For some reason I have always liked the way children interacted with Data, much the same way I get a kick out of Naomi Wildmon and Seven of Nine on Voyager.  No rationale explanation available, sorry.  In &quot;Pen Pals&quot; I am perfectly content to let Picard stew in his own juices as to how to save Sarjenka's planet without letting anybody who lives there have a clue as to what is happening, although I tend to think all those beings might turn to a theological rather than a scientific explanation that might alter their destinies a bit.

Though the casting was fairly good for that one, it was not as good as it could have been.  Plus the fact that it was a character that was hard to like.  There have been a few more in recent years also that though they were pretty to watch for the special effects, they were hard to watch for the lack of story.Picture my amazement when I heard that Bryan Singer would direct the film.

The  songs have a great diversity to them and that give them and very diverse  fan base and they never make the same song twice like other bands of their  nature. This album has a great mix of songs from the great opening track  Spice up you Life , to the 40's sound of Too Much and the Lady is a Vamp,  to the incredible Ballad,  Viva Forever. This is a great album, and I'm  sure the next one, Forever, will be just as good. I've already heard the  first single, Holler, holler and It's great.

163971,"Bram Stoker's Dracula? Hardly. More like MTV's Dracula where he walks around in London, wearing fashionable sunglasses. This is a Dracula where Victorian feeling in the book has been changed for stupid sex-remarks. And  a Dracula movie where the cast speaks english with an american accent  looses all credibility. Keanu Reeves is lousy and booring as Jonathan  Harker, Winona Ryder doesn't fit in at all. Only Anthony Hopkins is really  good as Doctor Van Helsing. Gary Oldman could have been good, it it wasn't  for ridiculous outfits.This movie is good for anyone that hasn't read  the books and doesn't have fond memories of the old Hammer-films with  Cristopher Lee. It has a good set (if you don't count Gary Oldmans Dracula  outfit), nice special effects and a good script. It just isn't  Dracula.See this a costly monstermovie and try to keep all the other  vampire-movies from your mind. Then you might enjoy this. As it is, it's  too much Hollywood for me.

63382,"I bought this title because Arnold Vosloo was a leading member of the cast, and I've come to appreciate his characterizations.  I'd not seen the original Darkman, so I had no preconceived notions of what the series was  like, I therefore enjoyed it more than a connoisseur of the genera might  have.  I did seen Darkman III first, however, and enjoyed it more; perhaps  because I enjoyed Jeff Fahey as a bad-guy more than I did Larry Drake.  They do say that the quality of the villain makes the film.  I also thought  Mr. Vosloo's Darkman was more brittle in II than in III.  Perhaps the  quality of the bad guy effected his performance too, or maybe he was just  getting used to his character and the series and was only  beginning to  develop his own particular point of view on both.  I tend to agree with the  reviewers who felt that the series would make a better subject for TV than  for Cinema.",N/A
362533,"This movie continues to be recommended to me over and over as friends see it in art houses, rentals and on cable.  In turn, I recommend to others.  This is a dramatic slice of life masquerading as a comedy.  It is  hilariously funny, but when the house lights went back up they exposed  light sobbing by some of my group.The plot is simple: gay Asian with  same sex mate decides to marry a woman needing a green card to fool his  &quot;old world&quot; visiting parents. Gayness is more a plot device than  an issue here.  It is easy to identify with these characters.  Though the  conflicts are comedic, they cannot be fully resolved.  It's a view of the  joys and frustrations of a loving family whose values are a big generation  apart.  The movie is partially subtitled and (I am not making this up)this  adds to the story because part of the humor is not everyone even  understands everyone else's language let alone lifestyles.

296569,"This film is considered by many to be the finest of the Johnny Weissmuller MGM Tarzan movies.  It's a crackling good adventure story that is a real roller coaster ride.  The African jungle, considering the B&amp;W  photography and primitive special effects, is vividly portrayed as a savage  place indeed.  Wild animals abound: charging rhinos, stampeding elephants,  lions with an attitude, and a tribe of fearsome great apes.  An annoyance  for Tarzan purists is the portrayal of Tarzan as a hulking brute that only  speaks in halting, broken sentences.  The character written of by Edgar  Rice Burroughs is an intelligent white ape that is fluent in several  languages, including native dialects and the animal &quot;language&quot; of  the great apes.  The Tarzan yell is overdone in this movie, too.  Depending  on the viewer's tolerance level, it may start to grate as chalk on a  chalkboard, especially when Jane (Maureen O'Sullivan) gets in the act with  her combination soprano Swiss yodel and the familiar &quot;ape call.&quot;  Again, ERB's Tarzan only gave this fierce victory cry as he stood bloodied  and dirty over a vanquished foe, animal or otherwise.  In personal combat,  Tarzan reverts to his primitive self and truly becomes a denizen of the  forest primeval.This film stresses the marriage relationship of Tarzan  and Jane more than subsequent entries in the Tarzan series.  The sex is  implied, of course, but one can easily infer that the jungle couple is not  celibate.  The costumes (especially Jane's) are very revealing for the time  period in which the movie was made.  There is a riveting &quot;nude&quot;  swimming scene that is a wonderful erotic interlude.  This segment had been  censored for years, but is included in the restored version. The plot  involves two wordly white men (including Jane's old friend) that show up to  entice Jane away from Tarzan, and to desecrate the elephant graveyard for  the valuable ivory.  Tarzan takes a dim view of these unfriendly  intentions.  Lurking in the brush there are fierce savages that stalk the  safari.  Just when things can't get any worse, the natives openly attack  the safari, kill the porters, murder the two white men stealing the ivory,  and, as Jane is about to be devoured by lions, well, you get the idea.  Before anyone dismisses this movie as a typically trite Tarzan movie, it's  fair to mention this was only the second film in the MGM series and it set  the pattern for much that followed.  The fast pace of the story, the almost  nonstop action, the sexual overtones, and the primitive setting all make  this an entertaining jungle adventure film.  Don't expect subtleties of  plot and character development, and you will be pleased.",N/A

481646,"This film displays a nice combination of dry, somewhat dark comedy and fun suspense.  Likely classified as a comedy, there are some good plot twists and turns that also make the film work as a good crime story, too.The  film centers around Charlie (Liam Neeson), a DEA agent who has had  one-too-many brushes with death.  He is burned out and ready to retire to a  seaside resort, but has to complete one last mission first.  A chance  encounter with a psychiatrist, and a resulting meeting with a lovely woman  (Sandra Bullock) who performs a very personal medical procedure that leads  to a date, change Charlie's life and outlook.  As Charlie makes his way to  the end of his mission, his story takes some interesting twists, and there  is a good deal of laugh-out-loud humor along the way.Although I have  always considered Neeson and Bullock overrated, both turn in solid  performances.  But, it is the supporting cast, headed by Oliver Platt, that  make this movie really tick.  Jose Zuniga, Michael DeLorenzo, Mitch  Pileggi, Colin Albertson and Mary McCormack round out a cast of familiar  faces whose name escape all but the hardcore movie buff.This is a good,  solid film.

302278,"A nurse's obsession for a womanizing-heel nearly ruins her life and the  lives of those around her. This dark, disturbing drama was the FATAL  ATTRACTION of the 1940's, and while Crawford doesn't boil any bunnies,  she's no less terrifying. In fact, I would venture to say that this is  Crawford's finest hour. Her character is on the screen for most of the  film's two hours, and she's believable and effective every moment. As much  as I loved her in MILDRED PIERCE, I must say that Crawford should have won  the Best Actress Oscar for this one. Crawford said in a later  interview:&quot;I worked harder on POSSESSED than any film I made&quot;,  and it shows. POSSESSED features the glamorous star's richest, most  powerful performance to date.

528174,"The opening scene for this movie really sets the stage for the myriad of beautiful cinematography that abounds throughout this movie.  Jennifer Lopez rides across a majestic desert atop a beautiful snow-white horse in a long and flowing white dress.  The sky is as blue as the rooftops in Santorini.  This is just the prelude for more.Jennifer Lopez stars as Catherine Deane, a highly esteemed child psychologist who is attempting to enter the mind of a comatose little boy in order to communicate with him and bring about his recovery. She's part of an experimental process that allows her to literally enter his dreams and interact with his subconscious through the use of a machine that sort of melds their minds together.At the same time, a serial killer is on the loose.  He takes his victims to an underground chamber, which automatically over a forty hour period tortures and then drowns his victims.  After abducting his last victim, the killer is captured by the FBI.  Unfortunately, however, he has suffered a rare form of schizophrenia which has placed him in a comatose state.  In order to infiltrate his mind in an effort to discover the whereabouts of his latest victim, Catherine is asked to go inside of his mind.The dream sequences that follow are stunning.  The costumes, the make-up, the settings are all awesome.  Some of the most memorable scenes for me are:The Horse - Catherine is following Carl (the serial killer), who is, in this sequence, just a little boy.  He runs into one room where a horse is standing in the middle of the room.  She tries to talk with him, but he runs into the corner and watches her from a distance.  She moves closer to the horse, rubbing him, and talking to Carl.  Carl, then, rushes towards her and pushes her out of the way.  At that moment, this clear box descends from the ceiling, cuts the horse into multiple pieces (which are captured within clear panels), and then separates.  Catherine walks among the panels, and you can clearly see the insides of the horse.  In one panel, you can still see the horse's beating heart.  It really is an incredible visual to see, almost like something you'd see in a science class.The Purple Robe - Catherine enters Carl's mind; and after a series of events, winds up on the floor in front of this &quot;demon&quot; on a throne at the top of the stairs.  This royal purple cloth is attached to his back, via hooks, and surrounds the gold room.  As he stands and starts walking down the stairs, the cloth begins to &quot;unfold&quot; itself around the room and trails the &quot;demon&quot; down the steps.  It is a stunning scene and reminds me of the &quot;Hellraiser&quot; series.Mother Mary - Catherine becomes a savior to Carl.  All I can say about this dream sequence is you have to see it for yourself.  It is stunning.I think this film is just incredible.

At the risk of sounding like a one of those stuffy, traditionalist Cambridge university lecturers it really  does spoil it for me when films based on historical events take ridiculous  liberties and forsake historical facts, which are more often than not  interesting in themselves to maintain interest, and replace them with  sensationalist and fictitious stuff.

But it is only annoying if it is meant to be  taken as a serious portrayal of the tragic and fascinating life of Anne  Boleyn, Great Henry's second wife and mother of the remarkable Elizabeth I,  and this film, judging by all accounts, is most certainly not.  The factual  content is a good enough excuse to get dressed up and go over the  top and the main leads Genevieve Bujold and Richard Burton give it their all as the fiesty two-some; the chemistry is striking and you can't help admiring the costume department for all those lavish items of clothing.Pap, but enjoyable pap and therefore redeemed.",N/A

The screenplay seems to  have been written in order to jump from one joke to the next, but with no  thought given to fleshing out each joke to give it depth and character like  a running gag can develop.

He first betrays the rebels after being  pressured by The Empire and in the end joins them to help save Han Solo in  &quot;Return of the Jedi&quot;. Not everyone is good or evil in this film.  Some have their own interests as Lando did in maintaining his mining colony  in Cloud City. The climax is great when we find out who Luke's father is at  the end. I won't spoil that if you haven't seen it because I've probably  spoiled a lot already. It is that moment that shocks the audience like no  other moment during the &quot;Star Wars Trilogy&quot;. It brings home what  the struggle between The Rebellion and The Empire is really about. From  beginning to end this is the &quot;Star Wars&quot; movie with the most  depth making it the best and shining star of the trilogy.",N/A
390847,"Glancing over the comments of some other reviewers here, one would think this was a &quot;pirate&quot; movie.  Well, yes, it is.  More importantly, however, it is a romance, a film that very likely helped inspire the  bodice-buster historicals that were so popular in the 1970's.  Romances are  fantasies and in such, it doesn't matter that the hero is prettier than he  should be or if George Sanders' beard looked strange.For the women  reading this, go rent this movie!  Lots of fun, fun, fun with titillating  scenes (tame for now) not usually allowed by the movie code.  Tyrone Power  as Captain Waring never looked so good and is shown shirtless, splattered  with wine, and stretched on a rack for your pleasure.The tepid romance  in Captain Blood with Errol Flynn is barely two stars compared with this  movie.",Black Swan VHS
65411,"My favorite film of all time is the 1999 version of &quot;The Mummy,&quot; and sinse long before that came out, I've known of Boris Karloff's 1932 creature feature.  But, I always figured it was another one of those  bandage wrapped, slow moving - and frankly very stupid &quot;mummy&quot;  movies. So I stayed away. Then, I saw the new version on the first day of  release (May 7th) and rushed out of the theater knowing I must see the old  version. Instead of renting it, I just bought it - and it was superb! The  basic story elements are the same in both versions, but instead of the  lavish desert settings, huge sets and breathtaking visual effects of the  Stephen Sommers version, director Karl Fruend's 30's film relies on mood  and atmousphere to chill you to the bone - which it does very well. Boris  Karloff plays Imhotep, whom in his native Egypt (3,700 years ago) was  buried alive for trying to raise his love Anck-Su-Namun (Zita Johann) from  the dead. Flash forward to 1932 were a british team of archeologists dig up  his remains and accidentaly revive him. Cleaning himself up, Imhotep prowls  around modern Cairo under the alias Ardath Bey, trying to find the  reincarnated soul of his past lover. He does so in Helen Grovesenor (also  Johann), but his plans might be in trouble as Helen's gurdian Muller  (Edward Van Sloan) and her boyfriend Frank Whemple (David Manners, both  from Universal's earlier horror film &quot;Dracula&quot;) will stop at  nothing to save her. As for power, Boris Karloff is a far cry from Arnold  Vosloo's running, fighting Imhotep in the '99 version - but is pretty good  with some supernatural Darth Vader like telepethy. This is surley one of  the most romantic horror films, as one in some way or another feels sorry  for Imhotep, as he looks longingly into the eyes of his mummified  girlfriend, but the film does manage to generate a few good scares, because  Imhotep is no softey, when you look in HIS eyes you'll see death and  destruction. And so while the 1999 &quot;Mummy&quot; is my favorite film,  the 1932 version proves that in Hollywood's golden age, filmmaker's really  knew what they were doing.",The Mummy VHS
100900,"Contact is a movie that works on every conceivable level.  It is a smart, thoughtful, and entertaining show with an absolutely brilliant performance by Jodie Foster (her closing scene testifying at a Senate hearing could be the best thing she has ever done, and that's saying a lot.)  What makes this movie so special is its ability to keep the focus on the characters and story despite the presence of some mindblowing, truly spectacular visual effects. That's unexpected with films today normally leaning one way or the other. (Speaking of visual effects, the camera perspective for the scene in which young Elle tries to help her stricken father is just impossible to explain or describe.) For the serious movie buff, the DVD includes some insightful commentary from the director and FX supervisors, as well as Foster. This is just a stunning piece of work that was overlooked to a great degree when it was released.",Contact
72074,"I was quite impressed with this film.  Namely with the fact Christian Bale conveys such a visciousness that if you were ever to encounter him in person you would never look at rich, wealthy, yuppie types the same way  again.  The thing that makes this film so much fun to watch is the fusion  of 80's nostalgia and raw carnage being displayed with such creativity.  I  imagine the forthcoming DVD will have deleted scenes that weren't used in  the initial film making the experience even more surreal.  What is so  impressive is how the director makes the mood so pasty and drab looking.  Every scene has this dark sensibility but most of the time you are  presented with daytime overcast skies, white walls and classic 80's  artwork. The sets make Batemans character seem so friendly but so  incredibly frightening too.  You leave the film thinking about all the  people you know in your life that could possibly have similar defects.  This film is definately a winner and sure to be the Christian Bale breakout  performance people will remember him for.",American Psycho VHS

With a movie, such as &quot;ravenous&quot;, I found it to be incredibly insane and stupid to base a movie on humans eating humans for supremacy and power. This movie is not based on humans eating humans for survivial, it is humans eating humans for the sheer pleasure of it.

66191,"I've always felt kind of ambivalent about The Birds.  Yeah, it's Hitchcock, and you get lots of cool Hitchcockian touches (the lack of a musical score makes the film much scarier than it otherwise would have been), but am I the only person who thinks there's way, way too much exposition and character development?  Every time I see it I find myself losing interest in the overdeveloped story until the brilliant restaurant scene, where everything is suddenly funny and entertaining and offbeat.  And that part when Tippi Hedren sllloooowwwwlllyyy walks up the stairs to investigate a suspicious noise and opens the bedroom door to find thousands of little feathered menaces... it's brilliant.  But you have to sit through so much gray, uninteresting, irrelevant character interaction to get to that point that the payoff almost isn't worth it.  Of course it's good to have deep, rounded characters in a movie like this instead of just a bunch of thick-skulled teenagers from Dawson's Creek, but this is overkill.  You could cut more than half an hour of dialogue scenes out of this movie without really hurting it.  But I seem to be in the minority on this one, so if you love this movie go ahead and get it.  You could certainly do a lot worse.",N/A

44910,"&quot;He who saves a single life saves the world entire.&quot;This was the Talmudic verse that Itzhak Stern, the bookishly serious accountant/friend/conscience of Oskar Schindler quoted to him in one of the movie's final scenes.On the face of it, Oskar Schindler was the most unlikely hero one is ever likely to hear about.  Lusty, earthy, and sensual, he was a reckless philanderer, a gambler, a member of the Nazi party and someone who saw the war as an opportunity to become wealthy.  But to the Jews who were fortunate enough to encounter him, he was quite literally their saviour.Spielberg succeeds with this film on two stupendous levels.  Firstly it is with the documentation of the humanisation and conscience of a man who originally saw the war as a personal opportunity and who, at the end of the 6 years, had gone bankrupt in his mission to save &quot;his&quot; Jews.  Secondly, and most disturbingly, it is with the graphic re-creation of some of the most horrific and barbaric acts ever committed by mankind, all in the name of prejudice and oppression.  Such is the reality of these scenes that viewers will feel outraged, afraid, paralysed, and oppressed.  Most of all, they will feel as if they too, had the supreme misfortune to be European Jews living under the dark cloud of prejudice and hatred that permeated the globe during the interminable period of the second world war.  And it will leave us asking the one answerable question - &quot;Why?&quot;Perhaps, as Oskar Schindler viewed these scenes firsthand, that is how he too felt.  An odd dichotomy in his character enabled him to fraternise with high ranking Nazi officials, especially the demonic Amon Goeth, while, unlike Goeth and his peers, treating &quot;his&quot; Jews with the humanity and civility that was so scarce during this age of insanity, of loss, of suffering and death.  Never before or since has ethnic cleansing succeeded so brutally in decimating the population of an entire race.  We must pray that it never does again.Schindler's story has risen like a phoenix from the ashes of this dark time.  It is a story of hope, courage, and survival.  But more than that it is the story of a man who chose good over evil, who chose love over hate, who chose understanding over prejudice.  Is it any wonder that a tree on the Avenue of the Righteous bears his name?There are a few names which have become branded in our psyche as being synonymous with the horrors of the Holocaust.  Anne Frank, whose diary etched her life and death into the hearts of millions, Simon Wiesenthal, himself an Auschwitz survivor who lost over 80 family members in the death camps, and now of course, there is Oskar Schindler, a man who was far from saintly, but a man whose deeds guaranteed him a place in heaven.  A man who &quot;saved the world entire.&quot;",N/A

118989,"I rented this movie today (will probably buy it if it comes out on DVD) because I appreciated the 1959 version with David Ladd so much.  (It is still available on VHS.)There are good things about both versions--  in the earlier, David Ladd at least attempts to sound  native to Belgium,  using their words for 'father' and 'Mrs.' if I remember correctly. Both  have happy endings.Much is added in Hollywood style for the 1999  version, however.  In fact, about halfway into the story, it pretty much  becomes a new story, compared to the earlier version.  I did like the way  the film touched on a belief in an afterlife and the good 'model' it  displays about being honest for possible kid viewers today. Some have said  the dog was cute.  He looked like a big blob with two tiny eyes to me-- and  he certainly couldn't 'act' much.  If you want to see a dog really perform,  then see &quot;My Dog Skip&quot;! Another good point-- the music score is  excellent.  I thought I had spotted a 'flaw' when the boy still had  'snow' on his hair after being in the church all night--- but then  remembered how cold those old European cathedrals really are! All in all, a  good movie for the whole family, and a an excellent way to see some great  art and scenery from Flanders, the movie being done 'on location'.",N/A

This movie incorporates many different aspects, that of a science fiction film, and a film about overcoming adversity and accepting someone for who they are. Even if they are a giant robot.

38210,"I have to admit, I didn't realize this film was actually close to (or slightly more than) three hours long until I read some of the other reviews of it! I was so completely taken in by the strange depth and profound  troubles of the characters that unfolded more and more through the film,  along with the slowly revealed motivations for their actions and their  unexpected connections to each other simultaneously, that time flew by  without my awareness.  And Mr. Tom Cruise's Academy award nomination was  no accident or publicity stunt; few times was I more impressed with an  actor's work.  The depth of this movie doesn't border on the spiritual;  you will see Exodus 8:2 as a leit motif dance through this picture- it IS  spiritual, in ways that will both blow your mind, and break your heart.I  would give it four and half stars if it were possible because of a scene  that devolves into a  music video that didn't work for me at all.

If  all you've seen of this movie is on tv or video (admittedly, the way I had)  the DVD widescreen and improved sound is going to make a HUGE difference.  The colors and textures used in the film are visceral, much like the way  Peter Weir, for example, uses them.  The movement of the wheat fields and  the motions of the insects are amazing.  Mallick, in this film, as in  Badlands, deals with the idea that flight and fight exist at the same time.  After each fight (and these are not gore in your eye knock down drag out  fights, you blink your eyes and you've missed them, but the consequences  are devastating) flight takes place, and, as in Huckleberry Finn, the  journey is interesting and wonderful.  The narration in this film, as in  Badlands is flat, almost lifeless, but the pictures that surround it are  amazing.  The narration keeps you firmly rooted while the pictures send you  soaring.  A great double feature with Badlands, and one well worth seeing.

463353,"&quot;A Simple Plan&quot; was one of the best films of 1998 and by far Sam Raimi's best film to date. At first glance, Raimi wasn't an obvious choice to bring Smith's novel to the screen. His earlier films all displayed  considerable ingeniuity but they weren't subtle by any stretch of the  imagination. In &quot;A Simple Plan&quot;, Sam Raimi is awfully reticent  and relies only on his story and his actors.The film tells the story of  three men who find four million dollars in a crashed plane. This premise,  which more resembles John Huston's &quot;The Treasure Of The Sierra  Madre&quot; than the Coen Brothers' &quot;Fargo&quot;, functions as a setup  for a study of human nature. It shows, without being pretentious, the  impact of money on a person's character. After they find the money, every  person in the film re-evaluates his former live and suddenly comes to the  conclusion that it was rather mserable, something they surely didn't think  before. At the end, two of them are dead and the live of the survivor will  be almost unbearable.The main reasons for the effectiveness of the film  are the sharply drawn chracters and the fine performances (especially by  Billy Bob Thornton). It makes the viewer feel uncomfortable because he  can't reject the actions of the protagonists as something he would not even  dream of doing. Instead we have the uncanny feeling that we would actually  react the same way under these circumstances.&quot;A Simple Plan&quot;  is haunting, poetic and endlessly intruiging film that comes close to the  status of a masterpiece.

There is a great deal of  fighting and characters do die, which brings me to my next point.  In  translating the series for American television, a great deal of effort has  been made to remove all references to death.

If Kiss has a flaw, and it does, is that it makes a hash of both  traditional vampire lore and there is no logic to its own use of vampires  in the film.  These vampires can go about during the day time provided it's  cloudy.  They eat food.  They can stick their heads out the castle window  into the sunlight.  They seem particularly weak, having to go through a  long charade to acquire victims and don't seem to really need that much  blood. Even their destruction makes no sense from a vampire point of view.

The book upon which this movie is allegedly  based is wonderful, and the movie, to put it simply, isn't.The movie has  the same basic plot, but it has been turned into a typical Disney  slapstick.  Although the jokes are often relatively funny and the actors  are obviously having fun with themselves, it really doesn't fit in the  plot.  The story of the book is also incredibly simplified, and the main  characters have been given typical &quot;hero&quot; makeovers.  Still, the  swordfights aren't horrible, and Curry is great as a sadistic, sarcastic  Richelieu.If you enjoy fun, light adventure movies, then this is a good  choice, but if you're looking for a solid adaptation of Dumas' classic  novel, look elsewhere.",The Three Musketeers Walt Disney Pictures Presents  VHS
511033,"I absolutely love it.  Like many concert videos, it waspieced together from two back-to-back shows; that's how they makethem--they film two performances and take the best shots and make one video from it. That doesn't mean that the performances are fake. And as for the editing, maybe a few fades would have been nice, but overall I find it very enjoyable (love the close-ups of Sarah!) Of my current collection, this is the DVD I watch most often, and I haven't even been a fan of hers for very long.As for the picture quality, it is fantastic. I can't rate the 5.1 channel mix because I do not yet have a Dolby Digital receiver, but I am very happy with the quality of the stereo mix, and I think that's all you need for a music program anyway.

116503,"Unlike most sci-fi action films of recent years, where the emphasis seems to be on how well things get &quot;blowed up&quot;, &quot;The Matrix&quot; has a brain and knows how to use it. It succeeds on almost every  level.Most prominently, &quot;The Matrix&quot; succeeds in showing us  violence and action in new and previously unimagined ways.Case in point:  the hyperkinetic action sequences seek not only to thrill, but also to bend  the mind, to introduce new possibilities. We all know that Keanu Reeves'  character, Neo, dodges bullets. But in a standard action film, he'd have  run away from them, or jumped off the roof.Not in &quot;The  Matrix&quot;.Instead, we get a visionary, mind-bending scene in which  we SEE Neo dodging the bullets in sweeping, amazing slow motion.Ditto  for the &quot;lobby&quot; scene, which is nothing less than a ballet of  violence, using Neo's and Trinity's ability to &quot;warp&quot; the Matrix  as a backdrop.Amazing stuff.&quot;The Matrix&quot; looks and feels  like nothing else ever made. Even the green-tinted scenes in the the  corporate &quot;matrix&quot; fantasy world that Neo's doppleganger Thomas  Anderson inhabits are so stifling and antiseptic that they're almost  menacing.And let's not forget that the premise that &quot;The  Matrix&quot; is based on - a world in which humans are unwittingly enslaved  to serve their machine masters - IS the most imaginative sci-fi premise in  years. It builds on current technologies - virtual reality, artificial  intelligence, solar power and a host of others - and seems entirely  plausible.&quot;The Matrix&quot; also has an enviable human element,  with Carrie-Anne Moss finding a great mix of toughness and vulnerability as  Trinity. Laurence Fishburne does excellent work as the enigmatic Morpheus,  though I found myself wishing we could spend less time on Morpheus'  Zen-teacher musings and more on his character. And Hugo Weaving is  beautifully understated as Agent Smith. Keanu Reeves' Neo/Thomas Anderson  is wooden, as you'd expect from him, but he does display moments of depth  along with the invariable &quot;Bill and Ted&quot; flashbacks.If  &quot;The Matrix&quot; has a flaw, it's an ending that's a little too pat  and seems more focus-group driven (not to mention sequel groundwork-driven)  than a real extension of the story. Otherwise, it's a masterpiece of action  and science fiction.And it really DOES show you just how deep the rabbit  hole goes.",N/A

Being the movie completist that I am, I wanted to see these moments  fully restored to their respective flicks.I wasn't disappointed. For the  first 'Lethal', seven minutes were restored- Riggs's (Mel Gibson) firefight  with a schoolyard sniper, Murtaugh's (Danny Glover) self-affirmation at the  firing range, and other moments. The picture quality was quite a bit  sharper than the VHS versions, and the sound was clearer, with better  separation... just what one expects from DVD!There aren't too many  extras thrown in, though.

I think, and some will agree  with me here, that the reason why people give this movie such a bad rap is  because it was the mother of all these new teeny bopper horror flicks that  have penetrated the movie scene. I (Still) Know What You Did Last Summer,  Urban Legend, the Faculty, Disturbing Behavior and now this new Final  Destination movie. People probably wouldn't complain so much if they had to  go through all that slasher hooplah that dominated the late 70's/early  80's. But it's easy to understand where they come from. Frankly, I'm  getting kind of sick of it. But Scream stands alone as the best of all of  them. Urban Legend was better? Give me a break.

450443,"Two things are essential if you want to watch this movie.  One, you have to like Gwyneth Paltrow, because you're going to see a lot of her; and two, it helps to be a girl.  Since I only half qualify I am not the best audience for this corny, but clever, three-quarters cute, romantic comedy.  Most of it is standard faire: London girl Helen (Paltrow) has to choose between puppy-eyed loser Gerry (John Lynch) and Good Guy James (John Hannah).  Circumstances make the Good Guy look bad while the puppy-eyed loser pouts real well and looks emotionally helpless, so it's tough on our good girl, who's kind of like a Brit Mary Tyler Moore for the nineties.  But &quot;she's gonna find true love.&quot;  Count on it.  It's just that there's an hour and a half of misdirection before she does.Paltrow isn't able to display anything close to her full range here, even though the film amounts to a vehicle for her.  The clever plot idea is to show her life under one set of circumstances (she misses the train and doesn't meet James) and ""a road not taken"" (she catches the train and does meet James) in alternating cuts.  Surprisingly it works fairly well.  To keep us from getting confused, her hair goes short and blonde in one set and long and dark in the other.  I like her better with dark hair.  She looks more glamorous.  I was surprised to notice that back-to-back adoring reviews on Amazon were written by eleven and twelve-year-old girls.  When I think about it, that's kind of nice, since this is a sweet movie and those tough little critics are an appropriate audience (along with me, I guess), and this is an advisory tale about the nature of men, illustrating that you have to be careful about whom you choose when you're following your heart.Most fun in the movie is the dirty deeds done by Lydia, (Jeanne Tripplehorn) Helen's rival for Gerry.  To humiliate working girl Helen she has her deliver sandwiches and then claims she got food poisoning.  To really trash her, Lydia sends her on a phony job interview at her apartment in time to catch her with weasel-willed Gerry while announcing that she's pregnant by same.

Depp is good, but his performance is a little forced.  Del Toro plays Dr.  Gonzo the way Hunter S. Thompson intended the part to be played.  He is  fat, loutish, drug addicted, and psychotic.  Best Scene of the movie:  Del  Toro in a filthy bathtub wearing a suit, tripping his brains out while  brandishing a humongous hunting knife, and Depp trying to convince him not  to kill himself by throwing a plugged in tape recorder blasting Jefferson  Airplane's &quot;white rabbit&quot; into the bathtub. The book was a  classic, but I think the movie was vastly underrated, mainly due to the  fact that Terry Gilliam is a master at capturing the essence of a work.  Gilliam is a visual master and he truly explores the effects of the  hallucinatory drugs that Depp and Del Toro are consuming mass quanities of.  Obviously, this is not family viewing.

Aside from his inexplicable addiction to the I-camera, one of the most distracting and  overrated camera techniques around, his visualization of Mission:  Impossible is cinematic, grand, and very exciting.Tom Cruise makes for a  good action hero and Jon Voight a slyly effective supporting character --  unfortunately, as the script stands, it gives the excellent supporting cast  very little to do -- the divine Emmanuelle Beart gets little more than an  object-of-desire role; Kristin Scott-Thomas holds up well but doesn't get  enough screen time to develop her character; and Emilio Estevez, Jean Reno  and Ving Rhames are all relegated to nearly bit parts, each serving his  purpose well but given little chance to excel beyond that.That said,  still an effective action thriller, commendably low on the violence  quotient, with a twisty plot that would take a while to absorb.

None of the characters were simpathetic in the  least.  I found myself rooting for the croc, just like Betty White.  This  movie could have used a cameo from Steve Irwin, of Crocidile Hunter fame,  just to give us at least one character worth rooting for.  What am I  talking about?

If you haven't seen it  at least ten times, then you are missing something. Scott dominates the  whole movie, of course, as Patton. A fierce fighting Amercian General in  World War II. So much so, in fact, that after the U.S. entered the war, the  Germans divided the Allied Forces into two groups. &quot;Patton&quot; and  &quot;Other&quot;. An aide of Patton's wrote a biography of his commander  and recommeded this movie as a distinct example of how Patton actually was!  A little understanding might enhance your enjoyment of the film after you  buy it from Amazon.com. &quot;Georgie&quot;, as his close friends called  him, was a bit of a child prodigy. In fact, you can leave out the  &quot;prodigy&quot; in some cases and leave it at &quot;child&quot;. He was  no doubt the most brillant general in World War II. In fact, he was slated  in this position when war broke out. Chief-of -Staff, General Marshall,  liked him generally. Ike was his buddy until things got out of hand. Watch  a man whole simply has everything it takes to end a war but he has one  simple flaw. The ability to be diplomatic and political. You will see how  one man can outguess, out-think, out-do, any other general. But his energy  has to be, sometimes ruthlessly, harnessed in order for him not to destroy  the political structure of his own country's offensive. We all ultimately  believe in Patton's view. Just get the job over with whether it be washing  dishes, mowing the lawn, or conducting the war. FDR and Ike were masters of  the other side of the coin. Shake hands with people you dispise. Befriend  those whom you have absolutely nothing in common with except mutual gain.  Cooperate with a country whose sole purpose is to dominate the world, and  proved that fact through the invasion of Norway before our entry. It's hard  to identify with a man who worships war.

227687,"(Review based on director's cut version) Aliens is the only true masterpiece in the entire Alien series as it not only sustains nerve wracking tension and explosive action, but also takes time to develop the  characters and create dramatic depth.  No other film in the series has been  able to do this even moderately well.Aliens takes place 57 years after  the original.  Lt.  Ellen Ripley (Sigourney Weaver) is the only survivor of  the Nostromo, where her entire crew was killed by a hostile alien creature  that seems to live only to kill and breed.  She is found by a salvage crew  and tells her story to company officials.  It's met with skepticisim but  when contact is lost with a colony on a planet (the same one where Ripley's  crew found the egg that hatched a face hugger), a team of marines is  immediately sent in along with Ripley.  Members of this crew include  Corporal Hicks (Michael Biehn), Private Vasquez (Jenette Goldstein), Lt.  Gorman (William Hope), Private Hudson (Bill Paxton), and Bishop (Lance  Henrikson), a friendly android. After exploring the empty colony they find  the only survivor, a little girl named Newt (Carrie Henn), and a bond is  already created between her and Ripley.  Not long after, the marines get  into a brief battle with the aliens that proves fatal.  Most of the marines  are killed and taken back to the alien nest for cocooning.  Now, Ripley and  six others must survive in a colony infested with over hundreds of aliens  and find a way to escape.The aspect of Aliens that most everybody loves  this film for is the action.  Most of it doesn't actually begin until the  last 45 minutes of the film but it's truly exciting, tense, and non-stop.  I can see why this film is considered a roller coaster ride.  Particularly,  the best sequences are when the aliens chase the remaining humans into  small tunnels and when Ripley arms herself to the max and rescues Newt.  Director James Cameron established himself as a true action auteur with  this film and it's easy to see why he's so revered by legions of  fans.There's a deep dramatic depth in this film along with character  development.  Despite the fact that the film has a running time of 154  minutes, it never feels long and the character interaction is far from dull  and boring.  There's three very interesting relationships that develops  from Ripley to Newt, Hicks, and Bishop.  After the death of her daughter,  Ripley finds solace and comfort with Newt, who also likes Ripley's company.  They form a tight mother-daughter bond.  Another relationship that  develops is between Ripley and Hicks.  It's all quite subtle but it's  actually very fun to watch.  The peak of this relationship is not when they  kiss as in most films(they actually never do kiss) but when they exchange  their first names and one wishes the other luck.  The other interesting  development is between Ripley and Bishop.  After the first film, Ripley  distrusted all android since one of them indirectly caused the deaths of  her whole crew.  She dislikes Bishop at first but it's easy to tell she  admires him by the end.All the performances in this film come off  strong.  Weaver is the best as she creates a strong and take charge  heroine.  Her character is a lot more complex than what is portrayed in  Alien.  Michael Biehn is very good as Corporal Hicks, a brave but far from  gung-ho soldier.  Also delivering good performances are Carrie Henn, Lance  Henrikson, Bill Paxton, and Jenette Goldstein.  Henrikson's character is  the one the audience seems to think is untrustworthy since he rarely  displays any signs of emotion.  But he's actually quite caring and is  perhaps the most trustworthy of the entire marine crew.Once again, like  the first movie, the special effects are excellent.  The creature effects  are slightly different in this one as the aliens appear to be a bit more  scaly with smaller heads but the end result is still a frightening  creature.Also noteworthy is a fine musical score from James Horner.  It's creepy, fast-paced, and fits the tone of the film just fine.If you  have never seen any films in the Alien series, I would recommend you begin  with Alien, a pretty good and decent (though not spectacular) horror space  opera.  Then you should watch Aliens but stop after that.  The opening  scenes to Alien 3 ruin all the development that occured in Aliens.  Alien  Resurrection itself is okay, but Weaver's character takes a turn for the  worst.",N/A

I could never convince myself to buy the series on VHS  (besides which, I had taped them from TV), but will be buying the entire  series on DVD.Unfortunately, as others have said before me, there is  little on the DVD besides the two episodes each themselves. Just the  trailer from televison. More could have been done here -- thus I took away  a 'star' for this. However, the quality of the transfer is excellent and  will present you with many hours of re-enjoying the adventures once again  (assuming that you enjoyed them in the first place).For those of you who  have not seen ST:TOS, I favor it over later Star Trek releases because of  the unique personal interaction between the primary members of the crew  (Kirk, Spock, McCoy, Scotty). This is the strengh of the series, and was  not duplicated in later Star Trek releases.So ....  If you enjoy a  somewhat hokey space adventure (remember, the charm of the series is the  crew interaction mentioned above) and/or would like to see the show that  started it all, this is a purchase you probably won't want to pass  up.~unabashed recommendation~Beam me up, Scotty.",N/A

The one thing that I have noticed is that many people say that this is a bad  horror movie. For anyone that has seen the Evil Dead trilogy, you should  recognize that THIS IS NOT A HORROR MOVIE! It is the most entertaining  movie (along with the Holy Grail) ever made. I don't think Raimi had any  intentions of scaring people, he wanted to produce the movie as eye candy.  He was trying to do something different that does not fit any one genre of  style, and succeeded. Do not watch this movie with any expectations: except  to experience a wonderful 90 minutes of eye candy and great one- liners.",N/A

118590,"Be warned, as you watch 'Eyes Wide Shut'; if you are expecting an erotic thriller, or a fast-paced suspense film, or a 'By-the-Numbers' formula picture, you will be disappointed! Stanley Kubrick always searched for  themes that would challenge viewers, and force them to see the world in a  different light. 'Eyes Wide Shut', his final film, certainly does that, and  is a film that will be enjoyed more with repeated viewings.What is  reality? This film challenges us to make our own conclusions, as we see the  story of a  Yuppie couple unfold. Tom Cruise, as the husband, has a  successful career, but is shallow and superficial, coasting along on his  looks and social contacts. Nicole Kidman, his unemployed spouse, is a good  wife and mother, but bored, and compensates by drinking and flirting, and  fantasizing about a Naval officer she'd seen the previous summer. As she  acknowledges her erotic daydreams to Cruise, he reacts, first with  jealousy, then with a desire to find an outlet for the sexual frustration  he feels. Thus begins nighttime odysseys into a dreamlike world of  discovery; of a friend's unfulfilled desires, of a dual-personality hooker,  of a teenager being pimped by her father, of a cult which may only promote  orgies, or may have a far more sinister intent.Nothing is spelled out,  or made obvious, and Kubrick throws in clues which will have you reaching  conclusions that you may find will change, when the film is viewed again!  'Eyes Wide Shut' demands your full attention, and rewards you with an  enigma! Is ANYTHING what it seems? The film's final line, delivered by  Kidman, is coarse, but totally in keeping with Cruise's journey, throughout  the film, and provides the director a wry closure to this most unusual  film!While 'Eyes Wide Shut' will never be rated as highly as '2001',  'The Shining', 'A Clockwork Orange', or 'Dr. Strangelove', it is  provocative and mysterious, and deserves your attention!",N/A

It is the perfect film for when you want something exciting to  watch that wouldn't tax the intelligence of a carpet slug and which will  make the most damaged intellect smile and then laugh out loud.Don't  believe anyone who says that this film is anything but a comedy but watch  it again and again and again.

The additional footage on the DVD, along with the  commentary, makes for quite the fun second and third viewing!

328625,"Moody Blues fans have long enjoyed and admired the group's unique ability to capture visual imagery in music.  In this respect, Live at Red Rocks is a crowning achievement.The beautiful Red Rocks Amphitheater provides a  uniquely appropriate setting for the Moodies' haunting blend of rock  melodies and classical accompaniments.  The video does an excellent job of  incorporating the scenery into the musical flow of the  presentation.Several facets of this production are noteworthy.  The film  masterfully captures the interplay between the band and the audience, long  one of the group's touring trademarks.  It also does a wonderful job of  documenting the three generation span of Moody Blues enthusiasts, scanning  the attendees to reveal middle aged grandparents in casual clothing,  twenty-something hippee wannabees, and some fully involved pre-teens, all  lost in the rapture of a major Moodies event.Viewers with a good ear  will notice that many of the vocals have a slightly strained quality, not  sounding quite as good as one might expect from the likes of Hayward, Lodge  and Thomas.  This is because Justin was fighting a nasty case of laryngitis  the night the video was filmed.  Even with that disadvantage, the music  still manages to be far beyond ordinary.So far as the music, the normal  repertoire is here.  Standard stage versions of classics like Nights in  White Satin, Lovely to See You, Story in Your Eyes and their traditional  closer, Ride My SeeSaw are included.  A true highlight is a magnificent  version of New Horizons, powerfully enhanced by a dynamic orchestral  background score.When all is considered, A Night at Red Rocks is a true  five-star experience.

421733,"Film director Lucio Fulci is an intersting case. On the one hand, his work is often very sloppy and slapdash. On the other hand, his films often boast  individual scenes, shots and ideas that prove the man was not without  talent. City of the Living Dead contains a goodly number of such moments,  and is therefore well worth the time of Horror film aficiandos. All the  usual objections apply: bad script, bad dubbing, no characterization to  speak of, etc. But the film works as a collection of hallucinogenic moments  (a supernatural burst of flame in an apartment, an apparition that causes  people to weep blood, gusts of wind-swept maggots) of disturbing, dreamlike  horror. He also manages to create and sustain an odd, nightmarish  atmosphere throughout. And I love the fact that Fulci had the nerve to tack  on a puzzling denouement that probably made no sense even to him.

317713,"A sad ending to Roger Moore's mostly distinquished career as the World's Greatest Spy. Pointless and void of any real drama,&quot;View to a Kill&quot; joins &quot;Moonraker&quot; and &quot;Tomorrow Never Dies&quot; in the dubious category of all-time 007 stinkers. Moore should've called it quits after &quot;Octopussy&quot;, his highly enjoyable romp from 1983. To blame the aging Moore for &quot;View's&quot; many pratfalls, however, is missing the point. The plot to destroy Silicon Valley with an earthquake seems implausible. The usually creepy Christopher Walken scares absolutely no one as arch-villain Max Zorin. Walken and Grace Jones (May Day) commit the ultimate sin of Bond villainy --- they're flat out boring. Even worse, however, is Tanya Roberts' inept Bond Girl Stacey Sutton. Her performance is sadly laughable. In fact, if not for Denise Richards in &quot;The World is Not Enough&quot;, Roberts would be sole possessor of the Worst Bond Girl Award. On the bright side the stunts are top-notch, especially the jump from the Eiffel Tower. The fight atop the Golden Gate Bridge is very well staged. However, the fire-truck chase through the streets of San Francisco is ludicrous. It's almost as if the producers, obviously blank on ideas, intentionally chose the most cliched of locations (the overused San Francisco)and decided to appeal to the lowest common demoninator by staging yet another &quot;Bullit&quot;-like race up and down that city's hilly streets. That stuff belongs on an episode of &quot;Nash Bridges&quot;, not a Bond flick. Ugh! And as a final point of contention, there's the truly awful title song courtesy of Duran Duran.(Of course, it topped the charts! Go figure...)The saving grace of &quot;View&quot; is the DVD package itself. As always, MGM is to be commended for a job well done. Included is the highly informative documentary &quot;Inside View to a Kill&quot;, which I found to be far more interesting than the movie itself. Another worthwhile documentary included with &quot;View&quot; is &quot;The Music of James Bond&quot;. Also of interest are director John Glen's audio commentary and the original theatrical trailers. &quot;View To a Kill&quot; will satisfy only over-zealous Bond fanatics, such as myself, who just have to have all the extra goodies that come with the DVD. Overall, a one star movie presented in a four star package.",N/A

It might as well be a series of still frames with talking  dubbed over it.  There's a scene near the end where the captain is talking  with an ex-terrorist, and he has his back to the camera the whole time so  they didn't even have to animate that.  I'm not saying that I expect  destruction and gore, but they could at least move around a little.  They  could at least go for a walk or something while they talk, instead of just  showing one frame of animation for ten minutes while two people talk about  war.

484802,"Much like Grosse Pointe Blank (a film by the same team as High Fidelity), this film takes advantage of John Cusack's skills.Cusack is the everyman. In the 80s he appeared in a slew of teen love comedy's that a whole generation learned to identify with. In High Fidelity he does it again for Gen-Xers.The movie has a certain poignancy that I think many late-20 to early 30-somethings of today can easily understand. One might almost call it a chick flick for guys. The tone of the movie is prefectly set by a complimentary mix of humor and subject matter. The characterization is strong for the most part, however there are some plot holes and slow points that keep this from being a five star film. Still, the film is too enjoyable to vote it at a 3 or lower.The DVD contains several deleted scenes. Generally this is a mixed blessing. I will watch these scenes and then drop to my knees and praise the editor for doing his job correctly. However in the case of High Fidelity, there were several scenes that I actually wish had remained included. This miht have added some cohesiveness to the plot. Still, as I said above, there were points that the film did move slowly, particularly towards the end. So perhaps, adding more minutes to the film would have been the wrong idea. One might imagine that the movie could have been cut better to include the key points of some of these scenes while still keeping the film at a length where there was no attention drain.All in all, I do recommend this movie. Particularly for anyone who has a love of counterculture or has found themselves feeling as though their life, and especially their love-life, was ever in a point where they felt lost or hopeless and they have enough masochism in their hearts to want to relive that.

What they were trying to do is to combine Marlowe's &quot;Faustus&quot; and Leroux's &quot;Phantom of the Opera.&quot; Now on the positive side, the music is memorable. Williams is really captivating as the devil's representative. Finley is memorable as the poor man who has his music stolen, becomes disfigured, unknowingly makes an unholy deal, and rises to save the naive Phoenix from Williams' evil. The story is well knit, and the events do seem to flow well. There is even dramatic irony in that Finley wrote his music about &quot;Faustus,&quot; and he himself will take on the role of Faustus. It is even nice that they have Finley visibly play the end credits so we don't feel too depressed in the end. Images are done well, and the general acting is pretty good. I am not sure the speeded up scenes really belong, and I think some of the humor is too low class. (Like when Finley goes to jail and has to have his teeth removed.)

The Godzilla suit  that they used in the film is probobly the &quot;cutest&quot; of all of the  series. He has a puppy like face with huge cute light brown eyes. His  dorsal spines that made him look scary in the original 1956 Godzilla movie  is all but lost here. They were sharp, jaggad, and uneven but 17 years  later they look soft, light, and puffy. Another character that made the  film intresting was the robot Jet Jaguar made by the inventor Goro. Who  thought by the end of the film that Jet Jaguar would grow abot 200 feet to  help Godzilla battle Megalon. Then all of a sudden Gigan appears. Its an  all out slugfest as Godzilla and Jet Jaguar battle against Megalon and  Gigan! Its a full 10 minutes of nothing but pure monster battle! It is very  fake, but it is a really cool ending, one of the best of the Godzilla  series.

Maggie Smith is awsome  (and look who plays the young Wendy). Cameos abound to make the viewing  fun, and the performers do well. The visual effects are awsome, flying is  so well done you wonder how he does it, and the first view of NeverLand  demands that you have a Widescreen version of this film... if you choose to  buy it.The plot, briefly, is about an adult Peter living in contemporary  society (just ignore the fact that he would be about 100 years old at this  point... IT'S A FANTASY!). He is a corporate lawyer who is fast losing  touch with his family and himself. A trip to London to see family  brings  back old enemies. Peter must go to NeverLand, fight Hook, and get his  children back. The pirates are suitably grungy and aged, but the Lost Boys  are the biggest letdown. Rather than the collection of late 19th and  turn-of-the-century children you would expect, you get a bunch of  streetwise urchins from any time period up to present day. And, hey, they  don't fly! The movie boils down to the final Pan vs Hook  confrontation.Those claiming the movie is over-violent should look more  carefully. Only ONE person dies. All of the Lost Boys' weapons are the most  non-violent weapons seen. With all the sword-play, no one is even  scratched. It might have been better had there been more loss for the  audience to care about. The movie seems to dwell too long on some parts,  not long enough in others. You watch the movie to get to the moments of  revelation; Peter finding out who he is, seeing NeverLand for the first  time, Peter finding his Happy Thought and what that thought is, him finally  becoming Pan again...The John Williams score is, per usual, top-notch.  The music adds emotional impact at moments when needed, heightening the  mood in others. All of his music is a great ride.If you liked the movie  enough to want to buy it at all, get a clean copy that allows you to see  EVERYTHING.

Those looking for a little bit of substance in their film need not apply to this one, audiences who want to grab a bag of popcorn and have some fun, will certainly get their money's worth out of this fast paced 'cartoon.'Calling this film a cartoon may sound like an insult, but with this film, that's not the case.  With this movie, we get loads of colorful characters and some crazy stunt work.  The story is one that you've seen a ton of times previously, and if you haven't it's still predictable.  Randall &quot;Memphis&quot; Reins (Nicolas Cage) is an ex-car thief who once was 'the best' in the business.  Reins is lured back into the business when his dopey brother (Giovanni Ribisi) gets on the bad side of a notorious criminal called 'The Carpenter'.  Reins comes rushing, reluctantly at first, to little brother's aid and in order to have the little man's life spared, Reins, along with his brother, must steal 50 cars in 24 hours for 'The Carpenter' or both of them will be killed.  There's some bits of Reins assembling the old gang he used to steal cars with including the sexy Angelina Jole-an ex-girlfriend with an attitude.  Master actor Robert Duvall is also on hand as the theif's mechanic.  Reins back on his old turf even makes a local gang very unhappy and just for good meausre, we get to see the car thieves dealing with these dopes in a few very amusing scenes.  Another main character is a cop (Delroy Lindo) who sees Reins back in town and vows to catch him this time out.  To this cop, Reins is like Moby Dick, and although this is nothing original, the cat and mouse, hide and seek game played between these two guys is also very fun.Gone in 60 Seconds is concerned less about plot and characters and more about cars and style.  The thing about this movie though, is that for a movie about cars, we only get one car chase.  Granted it is a long and exciting one toward the film's finish, but those expecting this one to be all chase will probably be disappointed.  But, if you're just looking for two hours of escapist fun, this is a really great movie.  There's nothing too special about any of it, but if you know what you're getting into, there's just a general aura of fun about the whole thing.This movie won't appeal to prudish viewers who believe themselves above a silly good time, fans of The Rock and Con Air should have a pretty decent idea of what they're getting into.

180967,"I admit to not liking this film when I saw it in the theater all those years ago.  I thought it trite and that it suffered from multiple personality disorder, since it started out as standard Quentin Tarantino crime-fare and wound up a vamp splatter fest.  I'm pleased to say that repeated viewings have increased my appreciation for &quot;From Dusk Till Dawn&quot;.The Gecko Brothers, George Clooney (in his best role yet) and Quentin himself, are bank robbers and complete badasses.  Seth is the cool, collected one, self-assured and able to control his inner rage.  Richard, on the other hand, is dimensia on two legs, giving in to his blood lust as though it were a heroin high.  The two are on their way to a rendezvous with a man who can make them &quot;disappear&quot; until the heat dies down.For reasons we don't need to get into, the pair kidnap Harvey Keitel, faith-lapsed preacher, and his two children and force them to help them across the border.  The rendezvous takes place at ... a biker bar cum strip club built on the ruins of an old temple.  The kicker?  The temple/bar houses gazillions of vampires who feed on the truckers and bikers who frequent the place and, presumably, keep the bar going by selling  the cargo in their pirated trucks.The shift from crime to horror is not as abrupt as it sounds.  In several instances, director Rodriguez suggests that the carnage exacted on the bar's patrons is no more horrible than that Richie Gecko inflicts on the people with whom he comes in contact.  In a way, Richie is a vampire already, an opportunist who feeds on adrenaline and power.Keitel seems horribly miscast in his role, but comes off believably and even sympathetically.  Juliette Lewis is annoying, as usual, but that at least gives us some pleasure hoping she gets fang-fu'ed by one of the vamps.  The kid who plays Keitel's son is acceptable.  But the person who really shines is woodface Clooney; for once, his underacting really pays off.  He even comes across as sympathetic toward the end.The extras and vampires are wonderful.  Other bar patrons who (mostly) survive are funny, macho cartoon characters.  Salma Hayek, in her too brief appearance, is absolutely electric.This is a goofy film that requires very little from the viewer beyond a strong stomach and a sense of humor.

It was something allright!  the perfect kind of exploration of human mind and the unresistably intersting and hilarious charecters make this movie one of  the best films I've ever seen!

99349,"One day, Randall Patrick McMurphy (Nicholson) has a great idea. His prison sentence has a couple of months left to run and he gets himself assigned to a psychiatric hospital for evaluation. It means no more work detail in prison and he sees it as an amusing break.In the hospital he runs up against his ward's boss, nurse Mildred Ratched (Fletcher). She appears nice but dominates, bullies and humiliates the men and sadistically crushes any initiative. When the doctors feel that McMurphy is swinging the lead and should be passed back to the prison service, Ratched views him as unfinished business and angles to keep him in the hospital.For McMurphy, his holiday in the hospital seems to be going well. Despite occasional frustrations and disciplinary issues, he is enjoying himself and, from the viewer's perspective, he appears to be making a difference to the lives of some of the other patients. Nurse Ratched does not view this difference as a benefit.Finally, McMurphy's &quot;holiday&quot; is interrupted when he learns that there is a big difference between the hospital and prison. He can on longer expect automatic release when his sentence is up. Far from it, he discovers that he faces a much longer stay than he expected.Jack Nicholson is absolutely brilliant in this film. His portrayal of McMurphy is the best piece of acting that I have ever seen. The viewer is totally immersed in this character and it makes the hospital environment completely convincing. The rest of the cast do a fine job as assorted other patients. Playing a mentally ill character is never easy but they are convincing as they swing from being a collection of disturbed individuals to a bunch of guys under the influence of McMurphy.",One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest

Hey, the big bear was just cranky from being hungry and wanted a little snack.Yes, I know I sound like a  moron. He was so cute, though. I know if I were ever confronted with a real  bear when I was not at the zoo or Northwest Trek I would either soil  myself, run like hell, or pass out, but I rented this movie to see the  bear. Seriously, I thought I would be rooting for the bear the whole movie,  but I did start to really feel sorry for the characters (though it was  funny when they were trying to climb along that log and the bear  thoughtfully decided to start jumping up and down on it trying to make them  fall off) because the script and director did such a good job of making  them likeable. Well, Alec Baldwin played a jerk, but I felt so sorry for  Anthony Hopkins' character who was trying to hold it together, and I REALLY  felt sorry for the poor injured man who got cornered by the bear and shook  around by it like he was a Beanie  baby (tm) being shook around by a  hyper-active child. Yikes!Overall, this movie was quite a bit better  than I thought it would be though, and I thought it would be predictable  but it wasn't. A few twists and turns actually surprised me.

526803,"""Road Trip"" is sometimes funny, occasionally hilarious, but mostly puerile and sophomoric.  It is yet another boorish lampoon of college life that relies on heavy doses of outrageousness, crassness and crudely sexual jokes to lure its audience.  It was successful in this regard, grossing (no pun intended) close to $70 million on a meager $15 million budget.  The film clearly targets MTV males and it knows its audience, offering plenty of gratuitous female nudity and chauvinistic aphorisms like, ""It's not cheating if you're not in the same area code.""  I really don't have a problem with nudity, but having half a dozen scenes that linger gapingly on topless women who don't contribute anything to the story is nothing more than tasteless voyeurism used to pump up the testosterone factor.The story itself is a flimsy and predictable excuse for a sitcom.  Writer/Director Todd Phillips throws so much outlandish foolishness at the audience that he can't help but get a laugh every few minutes.  In this regard, I have to give him credit for a job well done.  He manages the actors and the comedy bits well and keeps the pace up.The acting is probably the best part of the film.  Breckin Meyer is excellent as the tortured hero trying to beat the videotape of his indiscretion to his girlfriend's dorm room.  Meyer has a dry and deadpan wit that works well with all the inanity around him.  MTV veteran Tom Green is so far around the bend in this film that he can see his own derriere.  Green is a master of shock comedy and will do or say anything to get a reaction, including eating a live mouse.  My favorite newcomer was DJ Qualls who played Kyle, the bashful geek whose looks alone provide continual physical comedy.I usually enjoy lowbrow slapstick comedy but this was zanier than even I could handle.  I rated it a 6/10.  Add two points if you are in college and another two points if you are a male 25 or under.

We  meet them at birth, watch them grow, be adopted, and rejected, perpetually  waiting to be selected by a &quot;family.&quot;  We're given a closeup view  of one gifted child &quot;Homer&quot; (Tobey Maguire) as he grows up, and  goes out into the world, or at least as far as an apple picking farm and  fishing community by the sea to meet his destiny and love (Charlize  Theron).

Released at the same time as the Beatles' 'Help', this is closer in tone to  the unstructured 'Magical Mystery Tour', but whereas the latter Beatles  movie was curiously joyless and forced, 'Head' is actually pretty funny, in  both senses of the word.

Forged by the awesome vision of both John Milius and [director] Francis  Coppola, the film is set during the Vietnam War where Captain Willard  (Martin Sheen) is ordered by the Army to take a navy patrol boat into  Cambodia and kill the renegade Colonel Kurtz. The journey of Captain  Willard not only becomes a lesson about the horror of war, but also about  the very nature of humanity. While most films are lucky if they contain one  or two great sequences, Apocalypse Now is nothing but a series of great  sequences tied together by the river, the river that takes Captain Willard  straight to Colonel Kurtz and the films misunderstood ending. Confusing to  some, the end is perfect as fails to answer any questions about 'right' and  'wrong' - Questions easily lost during the Vietnam War.Apocalypse Now is  better that Platoon, Full Metal Jacket or even the overrated 'Saving  Private Ryan' because it simply goes beyond those films.

In his place, juggling four insane relatives (three of them killers),  a handful of cops, and two dead bodies, we'd all feel the worse for wear.

81283,"This film from director Gus Van Sant is more to die for than was his previous film, To Die For. I'm speaking of course about the one and only Good Will Hunting.  Matt Damon is Will Hunting. A janitor at MIT, he is a  man of brains, brawn and misdirection. One day while mopping the floors of  this &quot;bastion of knowledge&quot;, he discovers a contest in which a  student is required to proof a formula of finite mathematics. The story  takes a serious turn when this well- kept- secret of a genius is discovered  by one of the top professors in the university. The trouble with Will, is  that he has no desire to go around boasting  genius as do many of his  counterparts at the university. One day however, Hunting is forced to face  himself, for as he is thrown in jail, his only way out is through the  caring of the professor who discovered him. Now, Will has to make decisions  and think about painful subjects he never dared to face. As a condition of  his release, he must attend therapy in order to satisfy the requests of the  state. This would in the most unlikely way, change his life forever. Meet  Dr. Sean Maguire, a congenial but very direct shrink whom Will is assigned  to fulfill his therapy requirements with. But beyond the psychobabble and  bureaucratic intricacies of the state, the relationship between Hunting and  Maguire is one of pivotal proportions. It turns out Will Hunting and Sean  Maguire are both men holding back many a bottles full of anger and fistfuls  of pain. As the film progresses, the messages of life's challenges and  hurtles become crystal clear. There are more important things in life than  the everyday jumbles of feelings we get caught up in. And the only way to  discover them is to let go and take a chance. This is a genuine film about  release from our personal demons. In the end, Dr. Maguire and Mr. Hunting  help each other tear the other's walls of fear. Take it from me folks,  there is nothing more refreshing than seeing a film about battle-scarred  individuals venting their frustrations on one another in order to rise to a  higher lever of peace. This is a penetrating and lighthearted film which  surprises the viewer with its hilariously touching humor around every  corner. With a script that sounds so naturally spoken by the characters,  you would think this film was more about two ordinary people just sitting  around talking rather than delivering a written and rehearsed dialogue.  With its buffoonery, sensitivity and healing of the mind, Good Will Hunting  reinforces the idea that an uncommon story about an everyday hero is the  best way to evoke an audience response. This film is not only one of the  most effective I have ever seen, but it is one that should let us all know  that the things that are most common among the educated and uneducated  classes is,  we are all people with great capacities and with geniuses  hidden in both of our societies. Matt Damon is no doubt another addition to  the short but illustrious list of actors who are not just pretty faces, but  can also render a character at awe-inspiring levels.

Maybe it's because it's not an original  screenplay.  I found the whole thing rather long, drawn out and tedious.

Can't wait for the DVD so I'll actually own  this . . .",N/A

I must  admite that if you are looking for a similar type of movie, Stir of echoes  is better.",The Sixth Sense VHS
38543,"The movie is so energetic that it keeps you on your feet. Especially if you're a real salesperson, such as myself, you can relate closely to the movie. I'm not a big fan of Giovanni Ribisi, because of his emotionless  roles like in The Mod Squad, and others. Ribisi surely has proved me wrong  in this movie. He  &quot;kicks it up a notch&quot; as Seth. A self  entrepreneur, card room owner turned stock broker. It also stars Nia Long,  Vin Diesel and Ben &quot;where's my buddy Matt Damon in this movie&quot;  Affleck. Just think young, energetic, vulger, &quot;top of the world&quot;,  f--k everyone attitude and you got Boiler Room. A lot of the focus was  between Seth and his father. Throughout his life, Seth has been trying to  prove himself to his father (an emotional aspect of the movie that most of  us can relate to). His father is a well known and respected judge. Seth  gets a job as a stock broker, where he gains a little respect from his  father. All of a sudden, Seth is getting a taste of success as a broker,  gains a beautiful girlfriend (played by Nia Long) and has been accepted by  his father. Then everything starts crashing in! A cool part of the movie  was when the group of brokers were watching the movie Wall Street, and one  of the guys was narrating the movie word for word. I thought it was a great  movie overall, but it left a lot of loose ends. Like what's going to happen  to Seth, his father, and especially his relationship with his girlfriend?  It left you hanging! It also makes you want to go with an on-line broker  then a real one! If you like/liked this movie, I also recommend Glengarry  Glenn Ross, starring Al Pacino, Kevin Spacey, Alec Baldwin, Jack Lemmon, Ed  Harris and Alan Arkin.",N/A

These make for Mike Nelson what Manos: The Hands o'Fate was for Joel. Pointless dialogue, bizarre (to say the least) editing, goofily blocked shots are all unmistakeable signs of this auteur.

352022,"DETOUR is the ultimate work of art on human fate. &quot;Wherever you go, fate is stretching his feet to trip you&quot; says the doomed hero.  Unlike many film noirs and crime movies, the hero is an &quot;ordinary healthy guy&quot; as he describes himself, trapped in an extraordinary unhealthy series of situation. In another word, the film is truly chilling because it evokes the frightening sensation that this might happen to myself.This film has inspired generations of filmmakers from the French new wave to Quentin Tarantino, because it is a masterpiece of low budget esthetics. It is indeed one of the most influential film in film history.Produced with a next-to-nothing budget and a production schedule of a mere week of shooting, the precision of and ingenuity of Edgar G. Ulmer's direction realized a rich cinematic universe filled with extremely expressive details. Take for instance the way the lighting changes from naturalistic style to a haunting spot-lighting effect on Tom Neal's eyes as he goes into a flashback of his doomed story (a technic that, by the way, Scorsese has stolen so effectively in THE AGE OF INNOCENCE) . Or the cleverness of expressing his nightmarish state of mind simply by shifting the focus of his point of view shot in and out.Even though it is a low budget film in which it was impossible to hire known actors, the performance is incredible. Tom Neil's haunting voice-over sets up the entire mood so effectively,  and Ann Savage is... well, she is the ultimate femme fatale, so savage and brutal.Before the DVD release, I had been  able to see the film only with dupy grainy prints and low quality video. But now we have the DVD which is TRANSFERRED FROM THE ORIGINAL CAMERA NEGATIVE. Overall, the image is incredible, so crisp sharp and full of nuances it is difficult to imagine that they shot the film in only a week. But even the original is not in the best shape. A few scenes shows severe deteriorations of the film elements; some shots are distorted and some frames are missing (so it looks like a jump cut). I hope some serious restoration works will be done in the future to correct those flaws, then I'm sure I'll be the first one to buy it.",Detour VHS

However, it should be fair to warn American viewers  that the sound quality is very poor in this film and, coupled with the  thick working-class accents of the characters, leads to much confusion  about what, exactly, is going on.  The film gains strength as it reaches  the midway point (the scene with the &quot;restaurant to which nobody  comes&quot; is funny and poignant), and it seems a shame that the film ends  just as you seem to be getting a fix on the characters.  There are few  recent American films that I can think of that are comparable to this  one--more's the pity.",N/A

There are many sequences here that make you realize what a talent he truly is, and makes you wonder why he is not a bigger star. Owen Wilson is also fit for his part, playing somewhat of a nieve cowboy, with a good heart and his mind in the right direction. Anyone who has seen this or is interested should know that the film was not made to be taken seriously.

483413,"Every review so far has noted the plot to this movie so I'll skip that and move onto my thoughts of the movie which is an excellent movie for kids and Tiggers of all ages. Simply put, Disney once again has given the world a movie that is clean and fun for everyone and is very well done. Sure the animation is a few notches down from their typical theater run movie but its still effective enough and is a bit above the typical Pooh fare. I was very stunned to see how well Jim Cummings did replacing Paul Winchel as the voice of Tigger - while still doing Pooh on top of it. The movie itself is wonderful and once again I stress that its perfect!On DVD itself however, its a tad far from perfect. The Dolby Digital 5.1 mix is mostly front and center based with very very little activity on the rear channels at all - very disappointing considering the amount of things that could of been placed there. Another thing is Disney lied about the aspect ratio of the movie itself - on the box it states 1.66:1 (as that's the ratio its supposed to be) but anyone with enough knowledge of ratios can easily tell its 1.83:1. While I can understand Disney reframing the matting for viewing on HDTV, at least be honest to the public about what ratio it runs at.Beyond those two complaints which is the main reason why I gave the movie only 4 out of 5 stars, the DVD is excellent. Picture is very clean as it should be for a very recent Disney film with no compression artifacts, dust, or edge enhancement noticed. The audio, despite not being a great surround mix, is very clear - sound effects are bright, dialog is very understandable, and the movie's music score and songs sound sweet on the DVD. Plus the extras on the disc are also nice - the Kenny Loggins video is very well done and is worth at least one viewing as the song fits wonderfully in with the films themes of family, not to mention a nice song all around.Overall, The Tigger Movie is a wonderful movie and is great for Kids and T-I-DoubleGER-ERs of all ages!",N/A

100457,"Ok, before I review this film lets have a little history lesson.  First Batman, directed by Tim Burton, came out and was a big hit.  It was well-done and dark.  Then Batman Returns came out and it was even darker  and still was a great film.  Then for some reason, Warner Bros. hired Joel  Schumacher to direct Batman Forever and it was pretty bad.This brings us  to Batman and Robin.  I didn't think the series could get much worse after  Batman Forever but I was wrong.As in Batman Forever, the characters  are all dull and boring and the script is just plain awful.  At times the  dialogue is so bad it's funny.  The actors are all do pretty terrible jobs  but it's hard to blame it on them with such a bad script and lousy  director.  I don't know what Schumacher was thinking when he casted Arnold  Schwarzenegger as Mr. Freeze instead of Patrick Steuart.  Also George  Clooney is an even worse Batman than Val Kilmer.  The only way to discribe  him is &quot;wooden&quot;.The worst aspect of the film is it is so  incredibly campy.

522399,"Let's get one thing straight right away: &quot;MI:2&quot; is NOT &quot;Citizen Kane.&quot; In fact, it isn't even &quot;Die Hard.&quot;But it is one heck of a fun, entertaining movie, and I wholeheartedly recommend it. It's worth the price of admission for the trademark John Woo flourishes (doves, flapping capes, hyperkinetic action, etc.) alone, not to mention the stunning action sequences.Tom Cruise returns as superspy Ethan Hunt, whose rock-climbing vacation (an eye-popping set piece if ever there was one) is rudely interrupted by his new unnamed boss (played nicely by Anthony Hopkins).Hunt's mission is to stop a renegade former IM spy Sean Ambrose (Dougray Scott) from selling a lethal virus on the black market. To get to Ambrose, Hopkins tells Hunt to find the renegade spy's ex-girlfriend, Nyah (played by a radiant Thandie Newton). Of course, Hunt and Nyah fall for each other but not before they try to run each other off a winding mountain road (it's a John Woo flick, folks...deal with it). And of course, Ambrose infects Nyah with the virus, making Hunt's mission two-fold: to save the world AND Nyah.Unlike the original &quot;MI,&quot; which featured so many strange plot twists that it was often difficult to follow, the plot of &quot;MI:2&quot; is so transparent that you can see what'll happen about a half hour before it actually happens.But the point of this film is not plot or characters, though it gamely tries to beef up both; this film is about action. And &quot;MI:2&quot; delivers in droves on this count, with about a half-dozen of the best action set pieces you'll ever see.The only set piece that doesn't succeed grandly is one in which Hunt is dropped into a biotech company's heavily defended high-rise laboratory. The scene works, but it tries too hard to one-up the now-classic scene from the first &quot;MI&quot; film in which Hunt is suspended over a CIA computer.The principal actors all turn in solid action-style performances (especially Cruise and Newton, whose chemistry is tangible), and the requisite summer-movie lines (&quot;That's why it's 'Mission Impossible,' Mr. Hunt,&quot; Hopkins tells Hunt) are all present and accounted for.Overall, if you put your brain on autopilot for a couple of hours, &quot;MI:2&quot; will reward you with a superior action experience.",N/A

127590,"Well, Well, Well, where do I begin.  Lets start with James Cameron.  I admired the guy until now.  What can I say, he did some great work, TRUE LIES, THE TERMINATOR SERIES, THE ABYSS, not bad films at all.  But there is little good to be said about his latest pile of trash, &quot;TITANIC&quot;.  (what an original title by the way).  Its not exactly the most original  concept either, I mean come on, they've been making movies about her for  eighty years!  Most of which are several times better than this...  Leonardo DeCraprio was brought into the picture simply for teen chic  appeal...not a very professional descision on Cameron's part.  I felt  absolutely no simpethy when Leo bit the big one...infact, I was even a bit  releived.  What upsets me most about this picture is the fact that Cameron  simply ignores the many other types of people who lost their lives in the  disaster...sure, a few snid bits here and there, but unfortunetly, he fails  to go in depth...and do you know why?  Because if he doesn't show you how  horrific it was, he might even con you into seeing this film again as a  repeat audience; anyone who has seen this film more than once should be  dragged out into the street and...the makers of this film seem even  colder than the waters Titanic sailed in herself.  Not one screening was  issued for charity, unlike EPISODE ONE, which would remain the number one  box office hit, had they not engaged in doing so.  The most convincing  character was BILLY ZANE, although I liked him much better as a punk in  BACK TO THE FUTURE.  Kate Winslet's bra size is larger than her I.Q., and  is the only reason she was picked for this role, I'm sure.  Notice how I  refer to the characters as the actors who played them; this is only to  prove how unconvincing they were, and that i never once believed they were  the characters they played.  Titanic should not have garnered the  impressive amount of academy awards that it did.  Best picture, film  editing, director, and screenplay should have gone directly to AS GOOD AS  IT GETS, and I'm not just saying that because I happen to be an Opsessive  compulsive.  It clearly was the better picture.  It may not of had the  impressive sets or production design, but it had something TITANIC could  never have, the ability to convince an audience.  What I'm trying to say is  simple.  Why it appealed to so many  people is simply astounishing, and just go's to show you how shallow are  society really is.  I've had bowl movements more meaningful than this  movie!  Come on, folks!  Anyone mature enough nows this movie is a pile of  trash.  Titanic got it right on two accounts; one, hiring James Horner  (THE MASK OF ZORRO) to compose the score; (even though the award still  should of gone to JOHN WILLIAMS for his score to THE LOST WORLD) and for  the production design.  The only thing convincing in TITANIC was the boat  itself!  I especially love the fact that the entire plot of the movie  revolves around two teenagers jumping and running thru the ship just to  make out...simply astounishing...now that is oscar material!  A very, very, disappointing film indeed.  CAMERON! YOU  SHOULD BE ASHAMED OF YOURSELF!",Titanic VHS

With all this going  for it, how could I give this movie anything less than 4 stars?  The  funniest part of this movie is a fight scene between this &quot;macho&quot;  man and one of the nazis in which the hero's stunt double looks nothing  like the actor he is replacing.  The stunt double is about 6 inches shorter  and his hair isn't even the right color!  You notice it right away when you  see it, and it's hilarious.

76210,"Written and directed by Steve Kloves, ""The Fabulous Baker Boys"" is a tale of music and brotherly love set in Seattle.  The Baker boys are Jack and Frank (real life brothers Jeff and Beau Bridges), who eke out a living  playing piano together at various venues throughout the Emerald City, a  basic lounge act they've been doing for fifteen years.  Frank is the  responsible one, because he has to be; he has a wife, kids and a home in  the suburbs.  He manages their business, secures the bookings and is  content to stick with a formula that works.  For him, it's not about the  music, it's about keeping food on the table for those who depend on him.  Jack, on the other hand, is unattached and could care less about the  business end of the partnership.  As long as it affords him a modicum of  security as well as dignity, he is more than willing to just go along for  the ride.  For Jack, though, underneath it all, it is about the  music; it's about jazz.  On off nights he will steal away alone to some  small club to play, and deep down inside he knows that this is not only  what he really wants, but needs.  And he knows he could be great, if only  he'd let himself go.  The trouble is, he's been with Frank his whole life,  and as long as the act is working he just can't make the break.  Unless  something happens, his dreams are destined to remain suppressed and  unrealized.  It is only when one of their regular clubs balks at  rescheduling them that the brothers begin to realize that perhaps their act  is getting a bit stale.  So they decide to try adding a singer to the act.  After a memorable scene in which a number of young hopefuls are auditioned,  Suzie Diamond (Michelle Pfeiffer) enters their life.  She joins the act on  a trial basis, and after an amusing and somewhat tentative beginning,  infuses it with new life, though Frank continues to adamantly resist too  much of a departure from their original show.  (""Does anyone really want to  hear `Feelings' again?"" she asks him at one point).  Ultimately, however,  Suzie becomes the impetus for change that Jack has needed all along, and  the stage is set for the decisive moment, which comes when the dignity of  the brothers is compromised due to an incident on Frank's part of  uncharacteristic carelessness.  When Jack tells Frank, ""We've never been  clowns before-"" you know exactly how deep it has cut.  Kloves has  fashioned an entertaining study of relationships, change, and the effects  of complacent loyalty and self-denial; and the importance of following your  own heart.  When Jack sits down alone at the piano in that smoke-filled  club, we know that this is where he is meant to be.

46851,"More exotic kitsch from the Dietrich-von Sternberg collaborations of the thirties. It's not as good as Shanghai Express but it provides its own pleasures. The operatic plot (shades of Carmen!) features Dietrich as an  icy femme fatale who leads her admirers to ruin. Marlene acts as though  she's having a lot of fun which is great. With equisite photography  by Von  Sternberg himself, Edward Everett Horton (non-comic performance) as a  frustrated magistrate, Lionel Atwill and Cesar Romero as her deliriously  entranced victims.

140974,"&quot;Invasion of the Body Snatchers&quot; is one of the earliest science fiction films I remember seeing. A superior remake of the 1956 original, it's both chilling and funny.In San Francisco, people are beginning to  &quot;change&quot;. They seem to lack feeling. This is because they are not  human, they are replicas, grown from seeds that came to Earth from space.  Donald Sutherland plays a health inspector. His friend and co-worker  (Brooke Adams) tells him that her husband seems different. Over time more  and more people are becoming unlike themselves. It feels like some sort of  conspiracy is afoot. Sure enough, an alien invasion is slowly  unfolding.This film is about four people's fight to preserve their  humanity. The basic message is, if you are not an individual, your own  person, you are virtually dead. Love, hate, fear, and anger are what colour  our lives.There are certain things in the film that suggest dark  humour. Whenever you see the rubbish truck, you know another person has  been &quot;replaced&quot;. If you listen carefully, you sometimes hear that  alien shriek among the  everyday noises of traffic and city crowds. Kevin  McCarthy, who starred in the 1956 version, has a cameo, again trying to  warn people what is happening (to no avail). The film's ending is  completely unexpected.",N/A
378114,"I started watching these videos in Japan on my arrival there long ago. I had run headlong not only into culture shock but also the fact that, for a non-Christian country, the Japanese seemed to be embodying Christian ideals far better than the West.In walked Campbell. Amazing. I have watched these videos over the years literally hundreds of times and have always enjoyed them. Campbell's story-telling is elegant and always a balm for the day-tired soul seeking solace in the living room reclined before a television.I really cannot commend the tapes highly enough. They are preferable to the other videotapes in which Campbell flies solo, usually before a crowd which is either mildly hostile or hasn't done its homework. The cordial and informed interaction with Bill Moyers in George Lucas' elegant private library, and the frequent segues to cinema, artwork, and beautiful clips of foreign locales, make the programs a delight again and again.The first program deals with the hero's  adventure, and is liberally laced with Star Wars' scenes. The second discusses the significance of denotation versus connotation in Christian theology, and includes one Star Wars scene (Vader's death). The remaining episodes range all over the world and hammer home Campbell's (and Moyers') thesis that all religions are true in this sense: They are true as metaphorical of the inner spiritual potentialities of men and women. This is more or less identical to J.R.R. Tolkien's view of mythology, of course.Particularly fascinating is the footage of a South Pacific cannibalistic ""horror society"" re-enacting THE myth and Campbell's interpretation of it - the death and eating of the god. The male-female pair to be consumed engage in a public, ritual sexual intercourse, are slain in flagrante dilicto, and are immediately cooked and eaten. ""That's the sacrifice of the Mass"", Campbell points out.""There [in Roman Catholic ritual] you are taught that this IS the body and blood of the Saviour."" One is reminded of Campbell's elsewhere quoting St. Paul: ""Those forms which were merely mythological forms are now incarnate in our Saviour.""Is there a proviso to my bubbling over about this fascinating six-hour master class in Humanities? Yes. Definitely. My personal opinion is Campbell never received instruction in the Aristotelian-Thomist tradition of the Roman Catholic religion he forsook, as his thinking is not so much clear as agnostic, Modernist, and idiosyncratic. He knows less theology than the cat. But if you are willing to ignore Campbell's unsurpassed non-comprehension of theology and his conviction that all religions are true and no religion is true, and can content yourself with focusing on his expertise in Humanities, he's a stellar teacher.",Joseph Campbell and The Power of Myth with Bill Moyers Six Pack  VHS

That's not to say that I didn't enjoy  it, but it seems like the story is too small for a movie. The whole premise  seems a little weak and then there's all the usual &quot;save the day&quot;  tactics with no surprises.It's not so much that this is a bad Star Trek  movie, but that I was hoping for a lot more. If they took this back to the  cutting room and remove 40 minutes they could make one of the all time best  TV shows. Instead, you have a movie which lies somewhere in the middle of  all Trek films.If you're just going to buy one, I'd get the Wrath of  Khan.

6834,"I read Heinleins book years ago and was impressed by the writing but disturbed by the opinions he voiced. However this film manages to turn the neofacistical vision of Heinlein into something far greater.The acting  is ok, actors like Clancy Brown are typcasted (but good at it), Ironside is  always good, Dina Meyer was a positive surprise and so on. However there  are a few (no names) you feel got the role becouse of looks rather then  their skill at acting.If you turn your brain of this is an amusing  action movie that sometimes leans towards splatter. When you turn your  brain on the film is much more. Paul Verhoven manages to make everybody  sound so sincere when they describe there way of life as the best possible,  but the words they say and the newsreels (if you have an interest in  history you will recognise the style) gives a different picture. In the  same way he manages to, in the middle of the &quot;heroism&quot; of the  soldiers, to show how like the bugs and men realy are. The pictures of  milling soldiers could easily be compared to the milling bugs, both subtly  directed by a &quot;brain&quot; who spends lives without a second thought  in the pursuit of a greater goal (the Gestapo uniforms are a little to  obvious but a nice touch). Another interesting part is when you compare how  Rico and Dizzy are treated. Who was the person realy responsible for Ricos  first promotion? In this manner Verhoven also manages to turn the end into  a sad event (read &quot;Enders Game&quot; to find another way to look at  the same situation) even though everybody is cheering.This is a film  directed at those who will march when they are told to march and who wave  their flags when they are told to, never thinking about where they march,  who they are marching for and for what they are waving. As such it is  worthy of thought. And if this is not your style it is still a movie with  big explosions and lots of action.",N/A
210908,"Well, I was not born an English Major, and in younger days I was bitten by the Friday the 13th bug pretty bad. Now I can rate it as an English Major. In this specific episode in the series, the events DO NOT pass plausibility. (That is one plus.) Two, even if we ignore the pre initial credit scene, the start of the movie is done well. An innocent girl is going for her summer job, people in town get upset when she mentions the name of the place, and finally a friendly trucker explains why the people got upset, and the strange events at the camp. Wonderful! (If I were making this movie, I probably would have deleted the 1st murder scene for purpose of suspense.) The scenery is well done, and the counselors at the camp also have heard  some of the bad rumors. The tension is then released, and we get to know the eventual victims. (Another plus!) Then the murders start (as we probably guessed they would) but we don't know who is doing it. (Another plus!) They lead us to suspect the owner, but he is killed and thus cut off the suspect list. (Another plus!) Then things continue to get worse and we even see the murderer and get to know her a little before we realize she is the killer. (Another plus!) Then the final hunt and chase begin.

420408,"Along with Star Trek IV: The Voyage Home, this is the Star Trek film with the most &quot;mass audience appeal.&quot; A thrilling action-adventure suspense ride, Patrick Stewart and Jonathan Frakes deliver a one-two punch  with a great story and fantastic acting by this ensemble cast. In  particular, Patrick Stewart is at his very best here. In a film filled with  stunning, suspenseful action scenes and breathtaking visuals, Stewart's  portrayal of Cpt. Picard shines above all. The best scene in the film is  not an action or f/x sequence, but one played between Stewart and Alfre  Woodward near the conclusion. It's worth the price of the whole movie.  Jonathan Frakes does a fantastic job creating suspense, action, humor, and  fun in just the right balance. There is a storyline being played out on two  fronts, and director Frakes does a great job moving between the two and  keeping the viewer interested in both.To date, this is &quot;The Next  Generation's&quot; finest moment, and my second favorite of them all behind  &quot;Wrath of Khan&quot;",Star Trek - First Contact VHS
223884,"The more Ridley Scott films I seek out, the more the masterfully ambiguous Blade Runner seems like an aberration. His 1977 debut The Duellists is  perhaps the best looking bad movie ever made. It is probably also the first  screen epic ever to be wholly constructed around the &quot;scaredy  cat&quot; concept usually associated with the world's primary school  playgrounds.Joseph Conrad, whose Heart of Darkness(along with drugs  and madness) was the source material for the monumental Apocalypse Now,  wrote The Duel, the novella from which The Duellists was adapted. His  novella, like the film, chronicles the fifteen year rivalry between two  officers in Napolean's army where the origins of their conflict are lost in  legend. Conrad may have been contrasting this meaningless fued to the  seemingly meaningful wars their army was engaged in. Was their inexplicable  private fued really less meaningful then Napolean's wars, which like their  fued had origins that were also lost in legend? Perhaps. But whatever  psychological subtext Conrad's story may have had is absent from Scott's  finished film.As D'Hubert, the officer who is ordered to arrest Feraud  for engaging in an illegal duel and thus starting their own fifteen year  series of duels, Keith Carradine is more apologetic then upstanding. He is  a weak man fighting to LOOK honorable then to actually BE honorable. His  nemesis Feraud (the great Harvey Kietel looking constipated) is a bigot who  inexplicably wants to kill or be killed. What we're left with is a retard  virtually embarrassing a spineless social climber into fighting him. Who  will win? I couldn't possibly care less.Had Scott not made such an  arresting visual experience out of the film, it would have been easier to  dismiss. The Duellists is as staggeringly beautiful as it is staggeringly  stupid. A scene in the frozen winter of Russia is a particular standout.  Scott also introduces two women. One is D'Hubert's guilt ridden mistress  early on, the other his young intelligent wife in his later years. Both  interesting characters. Both almost completely ignored after their  introduction. Not content with that dis-appointment Scott teases us with a  fascinating sub-plot involving the still loyal Imeperialist generals after  Napolean's demise versus the new Royalists of Louis XVIII. Then he tops the  whole thing off with an ending of astounding power. Alas, these flashes of  greatness only hint at what the film might have been.There is no  question the Ridley Scott is a gifted director, but he is also one that  seems to actively seek shallow material. Even his most risible films  Someone To Watch Over Me and Black Rain have moments of visual splendor.  After The Duellists he went on to direct the gripping Alien and followed  that with his masterpiece Blade Runner. After a string of forgettable  films, many pegged Thelma and Louise as his comeback, an opinion I do not  share. I would have to say that the solid White Squall was a step in the  right direction, and Gladiator was a film so grand it obscured its  simplicity.The Duellists is what critics howl about when they cry  &quot;style over substance&quot;. A carefully posed tableaux of beautiful  images that never illuminates the humanity of its central characters. It  took me two tries to finally sit through The Duellists. The first time I  tried, the rich, comforting and ethereal images were so effective, they put  me to sleep. I dreamt of a Unicorn.",N/A

The story is not entirely original, but the &quot;Milennium Hype&quot; is  capitalized on very well here.&quot;End Of Days&quot; is a  roller-coaster ride with twists and turns, great action scenes, and enough  chills to make an esquimo uncomfortable.  The special effects are  top-notch.  Overall, it's more enjoyable than the standard &quot;end of the  world&quot; fare because, while it remains serious and dark, it also does  not take itself too seriously.  The result is some witty humor (although  don't be fooled, there's not alot of it!) and great action scenes.I was  very impressed with the DVD itself as well.

161616,"When you hear the phrase uttered ""they don't make'em like they used to,"" films like It Happened One Night come immediately to mind.  This 1934 classic has it all:  great writing, direction, stars, character actors, cinematography, you name it.  If Clark Gable hadn't made Gone With The Wind five years later, this may have been the performance he'd be most remembered by.  As down-on-his-luck newspaperman Peter Warren, Gable is at his best.  As the spoiled, rich heiress Ellie Andrews, Claudette Colbert is his equal.  Her character is tough, yet vulnerable, spoiled, but lovable, sexy and innocent, and incredibly appealing.  Filled with classics scenes that are laugh-out-loud funny, this film is balanced by many poignant (Capraesque) scenes as well.  The dialogue, direction, and pacing are first-rate (there's never a dull moment), and the chemistry between the two leads is wonderful.  Both Gable and Colbert appear to be having the time of their lives.  The most famous scene is probably where Colbert stops a car with her beautiful legs when Gable's thumb doesn't get the job done, but there are many more to savor.  When Gable and Colbert pretend to be a feuding married couple, it's hard to keep a straight face and admire the ease at which they pull off this ruse.  Other memorable scenes include Alan Hale singing ""young people in love are very seldom hungry,"" Colbert's fiancee arriving at the wedding in the ""Autogyro,"" and Gable pretending to be a gangster to scare away an amorous traveling salesman (trying to snag Colbert).  And who can forget the Walls of Jericho?  But my favorite has to be the bus ride sing-a-long where everyone joins in to sing ""The Man on the Flying Trapeze""; it's an absolute gem.  There isn't enough to say about this wonderful picture.  After almost 70 years, It Happened One Night is as fresh as ever.  Of all the screwball comedies to come out of Hollywood in the 1930s, this one is in a league of its own.  And how many of today's movies have women's roles the equal of Colbert's?  She is more than set decoration; she's an essential part of the film.  Without her cool, sophisticated performance, Gable's everyman would seem less than it is.  A film that truly deserved every Academy Award it received, It Happened One Night is a movie that will live on forever.",N/A
59946,"This is not my usual genre of film, but I bought it as I did &quot;Diary of a Serial Killer&quot; because Arnold Vosloo is a part of the cast, and I in common with many others have become an AV admirer. Although the premise  of the film is somewhat far fetched, it is still inherently plausible and  might have passed scutiny but for the unfortunate tendency of the villians  to kill off as many of their clients as their victims.  (Possibly the fault  of the editing done for individual markets.) This made it almost  funny--violent funny perhaps, but still amusing.  At the film's attrition  rate of millionaires, there couldn't be many of them left! As usual, Mr.  Van Damme approached his character with an affect expressionless enough to  have done Darth Vader proud.  Mr. Hendriksen's character was almost as  2-dimensional as Snidely Whiplash, though not nearly as entertaining.  The  effort to give him depth was limited to a passion for the piano.  Mr.  Vosloo's character was quite well done.  He seems to have the ability to  imply depth to and a &quot;story&quot; behind each character he plays.  Van  Kleef is not so much a man with a history (although one can certainly  envision a small boy, possibly from a good home, with the unfortunate habit  of torturing local cats and pulling the wings off of butterflies) so much  as a man with a definite destiny.  If one could actually replay his life  over and over again (other than on the video) one would always find that he  ended the same way:  perhaps not by the same means, or in the same place,  or even by the same hands, but always young and violently.  I had occasion  to met people like him (and like some of his victims) while working in a  trauma center in Manhattan, so I know such people actually exist.

16929,"In 1821, Spain's three hundred year domination of Mexico was about to come to end. A people's rebellion, led by General Santa Anna, spread from the arid mountains of the south to the rich and fertile northern province known as California. Peasants gathered in the streets, calling for the blood of the last Spanish governor, Don Rafael Montero. Although under orders to return to Spain, Montero refused to relinquish power without one final reckoning.Don Rafael Montero has arrested three peasants chosen randomly from the crowd and plans to execute them in one last attempt to capture Zorro. The crowd protests vehmently. Two boys, Alejandro and Joaquin Murrieta look on and eagerly await for Zorro to appear. Zorro does indeed appear and rescues the three peasants just as the fatal shots are fired. Zorro scuffles with the soldiers; at one point, the Murrieta brothers save Zorro's life by causing a statue to fall down where some soldiers were about to attack him. Zorro gives Joaquin a medallion and thanks. Zorro confronts Montero and cuts a ""Z"" on Montero's neck just before he takes his leave.After returning home, Don Diego tells his infant daughter Elena about that day's adventure. Diego's wife, Esperanza, remarks that their daughter never tires of hearing his voice. Esperanza sees that Diego is wounded and begs him not to ride anymore as Zorro. Diego replies that with the Spaniards returning to Spain that Zorro will have no need to ride anymore. Diego and Esperanza kiss but are interrupted by the arrival of Montero and his soldiers. Montero openly accuses Diego of being Zorro and places him under arrest. He notices Diego's injury and tells him that blood never lies. Diego fights with Montero and the soldiers. During the fight, Esperanza rushes to Diego's aid and is shot and killed by one of the soldiers. Montero kills the soldier and is quite shaken that Esperanza is dead as he had always loved her. Montero takes Diego's baby as his own to raise and has Diego imprisoned.TWENTY YEARS LATER:Three-Fingered Jack pretends to have captured the bandit brothers Alejandro and Joaquin Murrieta. The three men approach a group of soldiers, who come out to meet them. The Murrieta brothers pull guns on the soldiers, thereby overpowering them. The three men ride off on a wagon which contains a strong box. Unfortunately, the men ride right up to a division of soldiers led by Captain Love. Joaquin tells Alejandro to hide. The soldiers surround Joaquin. As Captain Love prepares to kill him, Joaquin shoots himself. Captain Love cuts off Joaquin's head and tells his men to keep the head and bury the body. Joaquin's medallion flies off his neck when his head is cut off. Alejandro keeps the medallion.An older Don Rafael Montero arrives at the prison. Montero searches the prisoners for Diego, looking carefully at Diego in particular, but fails to recognize him. Diego and the other prisoners are returned to their cells. The prisoner in the cell adjacent to Diego's cell dies, and his body is to be removed and buried. Diego manages to overpower the soldier who is guarding his cell, takes his key, and frees himself. Diego uses the soldier's gunpowder to free himself of his chains. Diego trades clothes with the dead man, places the dead man in his cell, and lies down, pretending to be dead. The soldiers carry Diego out of the prison and bury him, thinking him to be the dead man. Diego bursts out of the grave and is present when Governor Montero comes ashore from his boat.Montero greets the people, who are not pleased to see him arrive. Montero quickly wins them over, however, when he tells them that no one has ever tried to help them, but that he will help them fight not for Spain or for Mexico, but for California as Californians. Diego prepares to lunge at Montero to kill him when Elena appears, calling Montero ""Father"". Elena is now a beautiful young woman.Alejandro Murrieta is drinking at a cantina. He wants more whisky, but he doesn't have any money. He tries to trade his medallion for a glass of whisky when Diego grabs him and asks where he got the medallion. Alejandro tells him that it belonged to his brother. Alejandro sees Captain Love and tries to run out to kill him. Diego prevents him; Diego and Alejandro fight, and Diego easily bests Alejandro. Diego tells Alejandro that he can teach Alejandro how to fight Captain Love, but that it will take time and patience. Alejandro asks Diego why he would go to that much trouble for him, and Diego tells him that it is because Alejandro once saved his life. Alejandro realizes that Diego is Zorro, and Diego takes Alejandro to his secret cave.Diego puts Alejandro through a rigorous training program, teaching him how to fence and helping him build his strength. One day, while the two men are in the plaza, they see the perfect horse for Zorro. Alejandro goes to steal the horse that night. On his way to the stables, Alejandro briefly meets Elena, who is attracted to him. As Alejandro tries to steal the horse, he is discovered by the soldiers. All of the soldiers jump on top of him, and he is able to crawl out from underneath them. Alejandro swings from the chandelier and performs many other stunts in his attempts to escape. Finally, he sees refuge in the mission where he his hidden by the priest in the confessional. Elena is in there and begins confessing Alejandro, thinking that he is the priest. She tells him that she has impure thoughts about a man, a bandit that she met that night. Alejandro tells her that there is nothing wrong with how she feels. The soldiers enter the church, but Alejandro is able to escape and leaves with the horse.Diego tells Alejandro of a feast that Montero is giving. Alejandro appears at the feast, masquerading as a caballero so that he can spy on Montero. Diego accompanies Alejandro as his servant, Bernardo. Alejandro presents himself to Montero and his reception is favorable enough to win himself a place at Montero's table during dinner. The subject turns to Zorro; Alejandro makes fun of Zorro, irking Elena.Alejandro dances with Elena and after the dance is over, suggests something more energetic. They dance very spiritedly and suggestively. Don Rafael sees them and walks up to them as the dance ends. Alejandro says that he needs to catch his breath as Elena is a very spirited dancer. Rafael thanks him for putting it so delicately. Elena leaves, irritated. Rafael invites Alejandro to join him in the courtyard to hear of his vision for California, which turns out to be a free and independent California. Montero says that they will buy California from Santa Anna. When the dons protest that they don't have enough money, Rafael displays a gold bar and tells them to meet him tomorrow morning and he will show them something very interesting.The next morning, Montero takes the dons to a gold mine and shows them hundreds of gold bars that have been marked with the Spanish seal. Montero will buy California from Santa Anna with gold that technically belongs to Santa Anna. The laborers are people who are being forced to work the mine; some of the laborers are children and one of them is the priest who helped Zorro hide. Alejandro sees Three-Fingered Jack, who accosts the dons. Jack says that he stole money, but that the dons steal people's lives. Jack attacks the men and is shot dead by Captian Love. Alejandro goes over to Jack's body and turns him over. Alejandro next walks over to Captain Love and aks him what is so amusing. Love says that it is the second time he has shot Jack while he has been flying through the air. As Alejandro leaves, Captain Love says that he must speak to him at the hacienda.Diego, as Bernado, is grooming Alejandro's horse in the stables when Elena stops to speak to him. She tells Diego that Alejandro confuses her and seems to like two different people. Diego tells Elena that she is like her mother. Elena aks him what he means, and he replies that she isn't like her father, Rafael. Elena asks Diego if they have ever met before because his voice seems so familiar. Diego says no.Captain Love meets Alejandro in his office. Lover offers him something to drink; he brings out a jar which contains Joaquin's head and a smaller jar which contains Three-Fingered Jack's hand. Alejandro at first refuses to drink. Love remarks that whether Alejandro is Murrieta's brother or not, there is more to Alejandro than meets the eye. Alejandro dips his cup into the jar containing Joaquin's head, takes a sip, and leaves.In the plaza, Elena's old nurse from when she was a baby sees her gives her a gift. Elena asks her about it and the woman tells her that she was her nurse. Elena tells her that she must be mistaken. The woman says that there can be no mistake, that Elena must be the daughter of Esperanza and Diego de la Vega. Elena does not know what to think.Diego lights a flaming ""Z"" outside Montero's hacienda. Alejandro breaks in as Zorro and steals the map of the gold mine. Captain Love discovers that the map is missing, and Zorro confronts him. Montero enters and Zorro fights both of them at once. Zorro escapes and seeks refuge in the barn, only to be confronted by Elena. Elena is clad scantily in her nightgown and fights him. Zorro cuts her nightgown so that it falls off of her. Zorro makes his escape, and Montero enters the barn. Elena tells him that Zorro was there, and it is obvious that she likes Zorro.Back in Zorro's cave, Alejandro learns that Elena is Diego's daughter. Diego plans to soon settle his score with Montero. Alejandro is irritated that Diego does not intend to help him save the people who are being forced to work the gold mine.Diego confronts Montero in his home and forces him to call Elena. In her presence, he tells Montero to reveal the truth. Montero never actually reveals the truth, but in what is said, Elena realizes that Diego is her real father. Montero's men arrive with guns pointed at Diego. Montero tells him to drop his sword and he does. Diego is placed in jail. Later, Elena comes and frees him.Captain Love has men wire explosives to blow up the mine and the workers in it.  The soldiers lock up all of the workers in the mine. Captain Love lights the fuse, but later extinguishes it when he sees Zorro in the mine. Diego arrives and fights Montero. Montero sees that Elena is with him. Captain Love and Alejandro come face to face and begin to fight. Diego corners Montero and prepares to kill him, but Elena intervenes. The fight temporarily ceases but then begins anew. Diego orders Elena to free the captives as there is now a fire raging in the mine. Meanwhile, Alejandro carves an ""M"" for Murrieta on Captain Loves cheek. After more fighting, Alejandro impales Captain Love with his sword and pulls of his mask. Montero is dragged off he edge of the platform with the cart loaded with gold bars. Montero and the loaded cart crash down on top of Captain Love, killing both men. Elena races to free all of the people. She is having trouble with a lock when Alejandro rushes up. Elena is surprised to see that Alejandro is Zorro. The people are freed just before the mine blows up. Unfortunately, Diego recieved a fatal injury in his battle with Montero. Elena and Alejandro sit with him in his final moments before he dies. Elena and Alejandro marry and have a son whom they name Joaquin.",N/A

36935,"As a genre still virtually in its infancy, the `gay romantic comedy' (a term that sure doesn't mean what it used to) unquestionably has a long way  to go to catch up to its heterosexual equivalent. With `Trick,' this  process takes a few giant steps forward. This may not be the crossover film  many right-minded people might wish it to be, but it goes a long way  towards showing that there is actually a benefit to making gay-themed  romantic films. Viewing romance from a gay perspective, in and of itself,  helps to refresh some of the staleness that has inevitably seeped into the  genre over decades of straight variants on the subject. Even though the  particulars may be different, the universals remain the same - yet,  somehow, it is those very differences that make us take a second look at  the conventions in fresh and exciting ways. For instance, I defy anyone to  come up with a more purely romantic and emotionally uplifting scene than  the final extended tracking shot of this film. No film in recent memory has  more beautifully captured the pure, life-transforming moment of dawning  love better than this one does in that special extended moment at the end.  It reminds us of just how intensely straight love stories used to move us,  long before they became tired and we became cynical.As in most movie  comedy romances, the plot of the film is a very simple one. Gabe is a shy,  almost socially backward young musical comedy composer, living in Greenwich  Village with a straight roommate who makes Gabe sleep outside while he,  himself, entertains, seemingly on a nightly basis, a parade of willing  young ladies. Though Gabe frequents gay bars, he seems unable to find a  comfortable niche in the high-speed gay world he finds there. Then, one  night, Gabe meets on the subway his virtual opposite, a muscular hunk named  Mark who works as a `go-go boy' at a local bar and who exudes the kind of  raw sexuality and high-stepping confidence that makes him attractive to  many of the area's men including, not so incidentally, Gabe as well. The  hook of the film is that Gabe and Mark, once they acknowledge their mutual  attraction to each other, are constantly thwarted in their attempts at  finding a place to consummate their one-night-stand - and, that, as the  night wears on and a new day dawns, they both discover that their feelings  for each other have deepened considerably beyond mere casual physical  attraction and immediate sexual need.One of the factors that lends  depth to this film and makes it more than just mere romantic puffery is  that it does not deny the reality of its context. It deals head-on with the  issue of casual sex vs. committed relationships while remaining  lighthearted and non-judgmental in the process. Moreover, writer Jason  Schafer and director Jim Fall demonstrate an ear for naturalistic speech,  often finding humor and poignancy in the very same line of dialogue. They  have surrounded the two main figures with a bevy of offbeat, slightly  quirky characters who make up Gabe and Mark's worlds in the form of best  friends, roommates, former lovers, business associates etc. Tori Spelling  does a delightful turn as Gabe's ditzy ex-girlfriend and current best  friend who feels conflicted over her own romantic feelings for this man she  knows will never love her as she would like him to. The women are not brain  surgeons in this film (Gabe's roommate's girlfriend is another case in  point), but they sure are likeable.In fact, likeability is probably  `Trick's biggest selling point and in no area of the film is this quality  more beautifully captured than in the performances of Christian Campbell  and J.P. Pitoc as Gabe and Mark, respectively. Campbell conveys the  goodnatured shyness and sexual awkwardness of Gabe with a warmhearted  subtlety that is truly infectious. Pitoc also manifests the sweetness and  intelligence that initially lie hidden beneath the veneer of his  sexually-assured, almost dumb-jock exterior. It is the ever emerging depth  in Mark's character that wins Gabe over to his side - and us as well.And  then we have that great closing scene! It reminds us all - gay, straight or  whatever - just how transcendent that moment of burgeoning true love can  be. As Gabe walks towards the camera, smiling and peering out at his world  with that look that tells us that the objects in it have suddenly been  transformed into magical sources of wonder, our hearts go with him. We care  about how this relationship will turn out - and, if that is not the mark of  a successful movie romance, I don't know what is.",N/A

This is one of those movies, and for some reason, it didn't feel overlong like the shorter version. Also, the final battle is a lot better in widescreen than non widescreen. The movie has brilliantly handled action scenes, and it is a shame John Wayne didn't direct more action movies like this. The final battle and the ending are heartbreaking, especially when the last survivors, a woman her daughter and a black slave, are spared and the little girl, played by one of John Wayne's daughters, asks her mother &quot;Where's Daddy, Mommy?&quot; It still brings tears to my eyes when I hear that.

214337,"That the series took a comedic turn with Star Trek IV is well known, though the 80s-style humor seems a bit forced and dated now (punk rocker, Russians, etc.). Nimoy's second turn at directing is more imaginative than his first Trek, even if this one suffers occasionally from stock characters and a case of the ""cutes."" Star Trek IV delivers on most fronts--good dialogue, decent special effects, competent acting. The plot is recycled sci-fi: Kirk and crew timewarp to save Earth from a menace that's never quite explained or explored. Along the way, they deliver a heavy-handed message about ecology and have some misadventures. Leonard Rosenman's asymetric score will make you pine for Goldsmith and Horner, and Catherine Hicks is at times grating and juvenile, but there's some genuine warmth here. Widescreen also makes this look like a movie, rather than a big TV show. Basically completes a story that took three films and five years to finish.",N/A

I also love John Leguizamo's stylish Tybalt and Claire  Danes' beautiful Juliet.

304540,"This film is a series of reality inversions.  As fugitive on the run Steve Railsback blunders into a movie set, he sets off a chain of events that leads...well, no one seems to know where.  Director Eli Cross takes him  under his wing, or seems to.  The Barbara Hershey character falls in love  with him, or seems to.  And someone wants him dead, or seems to, or maybe  doesn't.  It all comes to light in the final Duesenberg plunge off the  bridge.  Scattered throughout are many acidic comments on the movie  business--one scene has O'Toole wishing that the script writer could see  the daily rushes, as the director had kept a line or two of his dialog  intact.  Peter O'Toole's performance is a gem, worthy to be set at the  other end of the stylistic spectrum of _Lawrence of Arabia_.  His cynical  grimace could curdle milk at fifty paces.

483038,"As a longtime fan of Yes, I am pleased that after 30+ years we finally have a superb concert video of the band. Taped originally in HDTV format, this DVD is a special treat for those viewers who have a progressive-scan  (480p) DVD player and an HD-ready television. The video is brilliant and  sharp, and the Dolby Digital 5.1-channel sound mix is exquisite. Each  instrument can be heard in detail, which, considering the prodigious  musical skills of each band member, is a real listening pleasure.Yes  fans will especially appreciate the excellent performances of Yours Is No  Disgrace (the opening number), Homeworld (from the most recent CD), and  Awaken. Standards like Roundabout, And You And I, and Your Move/I've Seen  All Good People are done competently if cursorily, and the technical  quality of the sound and picture is hands above any other Yes footage to  date.Guitarist Steve Howe is in great form, as good as he has ever been.  He and bassist Chris Squire play a variety of beautiful and unusual  instruments, which fellow musicians will enjoy seeing (Squire even has a  3-necked bass on Awaken; the top neck is basically the bottom 3 strings of  a standard electric guitar. Perhaps this instrument was built just for this  song!). Squire and vocalist Jon Anderson seem to really enjoy the  performance, and their positive attitude adds to the viewer's enjoyment. In  addition to his vocal duties, Anderson plays a variety of interesting  incidental instruments, including a miniature harp he hangs on his chest  with a shoulder strap. Unfortunately, the younger generation of Yes-men,  guitarist-vocalist Billy Sherwood and keyboardist Ivan Khoroshev, don't get  enough air time. Both are incredible musicians, and it would have been nice  to see more of them (sadly, Sherwood has since left the group). Yes is not  a big drum band, but longtime drummer Alan White gets his share of shots,  and he also seems to be having a good time.Several DVD extras are worth  mentioning. The best is a DD 5.1 channel mix of Homeworld, which is a  totally different experience from hearing it on audio CD. The video that  plays during Homeworld consists of shots of the video game of the same  name; this is also fairly interesting. There are also interviews with all  band members (except White) and a few shots of them playing in the  studio.Considering progressive-scan video source, DD 5.1 sound mix, and  overall performance quality, this DVD is a must-have for the home theater  enthusiast, and of course for any Yes fan.",N/A

Harlan  Ellison's legendary feud over script revision with Gene Roddenberry is well  known, and supposedly the original script is even better than the one used.  Nevertheless I've not seen any other TV script that approaches the  profundity of this.  Kirk and Spock track Bones through a time/space portal  to 1930 and meet Edith Keeler, a person who changed history after being  saved by Bones.  Kirk falls in love with her, but has to decide between  love and the Allied WWII victory.  This whole episode is thought  provoking, the characters are believable, the fact that this was done in  1967 shines through in its creativity and emotional intensity.

Sounds too  tasteless to be bearable? Well, actually no. If you can retain your sense  of humour, you can find this film thoroughly enjoyable. It's mainly down to  the hilarious camp acting of Thorn in the title role, whether she is  strutting around the camp, spitting insults in a thick hammy accent at all  the inmates, or seducing male prisoners in her boudoir using her famous  chest to maximum effect. Still, the various scenes of torture are  surprisingly convincing, and very realistic, especially those carried out  by Ilsa in her secret torture chamber on a prize female subject, so this is  definitely not a film for the squeamish. Theres even room for suspense  during the climax when Ilsa's cruel reign is finally overturned. Overall,  an enjoyable romp for people who have seen everything the mainstream has to  offer.

Though Heston plays his character, Judah Ben-Hur, very wooden-like, the film stays afloat with vibrant performances by Stephen Boyd as Messala, the Roman Tribune; Hugh Griffith as Sheik Ilderim; and Haya Harareet as Esther, Judah's love interest (though Wyler regretted putting her in the film).

71552,"This is an independent documentary about pro-wrestling which goes beyond the hype of the spectacle.  The producer/director, Barry Blaustein, spent  two years traveling around the country and making this film.  The president  of the World Wrestling Federation, Vince McMahon is in it, but has refused  to advertise it on TV and has tried to suppress it.  This has only added to  the interest I had in the film.The audience is told from the beginning  that this is not a sport, but a spectacle, with choreographed excitement  and no doubt of the outcome of each match.  And perhaps that is why there  are no regulations to protect the wrestlers.  They wrestle 25-27 days per  month, are constantly traveling, and are usually in pain.  Because even  though it is a staged performance, the blows are often real;  these men are  just willing to absorb it.We see the wannabe's learning to wrestle in a  gym;  we see the staging of the big shows; we see the sumptuous office of  WWF and a young wrestler discussing his promotion with McMahon.  And then  we also see the very real people behind the hype as Blaustein does in-depth  interviews and spends time with three very different wrestlers.We see  the blood, the injuries, the very real pain.

From anti-war to anti-government to anti-media, he exposes the overlooked consequences of what makes us 'proud to be an American.'  In this movie, however, he seems to have lost something. 'Any Given Sunday' begins to reveal the violence and life threatening effects football can have on its players, but a Hollywood ending defeats any point.  Dennis Quaid plays an aging QB, whose body has been through so much his body can hardly function properly.  He doubts his ability to still perform, but thanks to his wife, who is more concerned with her own prestige than her husband's heath, he gives it one more go.  Is it worth risking your health and wellbeing after you've already accomplished so much?  But the really terrible part takes place between the coach, the team doctor, and an injured player.  After the coach fires the doc for not telling an injured player he's unfit to play, he tells the player, with a straight face, he can still play.  The coach has everything to gain (money, victory, prestige...) and only to lose a player's health.  Kind of sick how they think.  It's too bad the player doesn't get paralyzed.  At least then it would show that there are limitations that not even money can patch up.  Look at Muhammad Ali, one of the revolutionary thinkers of the 20th century whose full potential as a leader was cut short, or any retired pro-football player over 60- if you can find any seeing as that exceeds their life expectancy.

Even if the double jeopardy law allowed Libby  (Ashley Judd) to kill her husband without penalty after serving her time  (which it doesn't), she would still go back to jail for parole violations  (possession of a weapon among other things).  The plot line is threadbare  from overuse.  This is a cross between ""The Fugitive"" and ""The Pelican  Brief"";  innocent girl chasing after the bad guy while everyone is chasing  after her.This film asks the viewer to leap chasm after chasm of  incredulity.  Let's examine some of the malarkey they ask us to swallow.  Do they expect us to believe that Libby wakes up covered with blood, sees a  knife on the deck and doesn't expect foul play?  Is there anyone on the  planet stupid enough to pick up the knife and make themselves the prime  murder suspect?  When she's in jail and suspects that her husband is alive,  why isn't she calling her lawyer, the prosecutor, the press and anyone else  she knows who could hire a private investigator to find him?  When Travis  (Tommy Lee Jones) caught her, are we really supposed to believe that he  would leave his keys in the car with her inside?  And after she crashed  four times into other cars and knocked one off the back of the ferry, no  one noticed?  And my favorite; why didn't Nick (Bruce Greenwood) strangle  her before stuffing her in the coffin with her knapsack with the gun in it?  Even if he had forgotten that Travis told him that Libby had a gun, don't  tell me he couldn't feel the weight of a handgun in the knapsack.Tommy  Lee Jones was out of gas in this film.  Between ""The Fugitive"", ""US  Marshals"", and this, he has played the same character in the same situation  so many times in succession that he has grown flaccid from boredom. Ashley  Judd was actually excellent, and was the only reason to see the film.  Her  athleticism as well as her intensity impressed me.  It is seldom that you  will see a female actress agree to do her own stunts, especially one that  involves escaping from a submerged vehicle.Acclaimed director Bruce  Beresford proves that a big budget, bankable stars and talented filming  cannot save a trashy script.  The filming of this movie was technically  excellent, containing good suspense, thrilling stunt work, great chase  scenes and plenty of plot twists.  But Beresford must have decided that all  the plot holes didn't matter, since he didn't demand rewrites.

406758,"I first saw this movie in the early 70s on TV and have rented it numerous times since the advent of VHS. It is an eye-opening portrayal of Richard Daddiere, an eager navy veteran who giddily wins his first teachng assignment at a hopelessly urban hellhole of a school. Right from the start though, one can immediately sense that his altruistic belief in the nobility of teaching will be reduced that of a desperate corrections officer doing his best to quell a daily uprising. And this does become the case very early into the film and serves as the film's central conflict. His first day of class begins with one of the punks hurling a baseball within inches of his head the first moment he turns his back on them, blasting a cracked hole into the blacboard. Daddiere wryly retorts with, &quot;Well...whoever threw that will never play centerfield for the Yankees.&quot; This is our introduction to the likes of Artie West, more than convincingly played by the late Vic Morrow, a vicious punk whose demeanor instantaneously reveals that it is lkely that he'll not live a day beyond his twenty-first birthday. Then there is Gregory Miller, smoothly played by Sidney Poitier-a cool black cat who knows the score and is inherently decent. Daddiere smells this in him and encourages him to put his keenness to good use rather than waste his potential by being a lowlife like West and the rest of hs ilk. But Miller's race justifies his roguery, and he remains a sympathetic character for the duration. Then there is Bilozzi, a frightened punk and who takes sides with West because he's too afraid to be his own man and think for himself. I really admired this film, as it credibly depicted one man's quest to teach the unteachable, even though he well realizes that it is an unwinnable battle. Glenn Ford's performance is astonishingly good. His character seethes with a relentless desire to achieve his goal despite whatever these delinquents do to deter him. Louis Calhern also turns in a wonderful performance as a jaded, veteran history teacher who serves as a type of Greek chorus for Daddiere, constantly reminding him from the start that all that is does not glitter. When Daddiere insists to him at one point that &quot;If only I could just reach them...get inside their minds!&quot;, Calhern wittily replies, &quot;Mind?

150683,"For me, the highlight of this terrific comedy is the perfect performance by Barbara Stanwyck.  Although not a conventional beauty by Hollywood standards, she is very sexy and funny as nightclub singer Sugarpuss O'Shea,  who ends up hiding out with eight stuffy professors writing up a new  encyclopaedia.  She needs to hide to protect her crook boyfriend Dana  Andrews, and the professors want her there because she can explain to them  the meanings behind modern slang, since the professors are anything but hip  and modern.  Gary Cooper plays the professor responsible for the language  sections of the encyclopaedia, and he quickly falls in love with her.  Of  course, numerous complications arise.  Stanwyck, one of classic film's most  versatile actresses, is terrific, and all of the professors (including  Cooper) deliver warm, affectionate performances.  The scene where Stanwyck  gets them dancing is hilarious.  This is classic comedy has been somewhat  overlooked, but don't miss a chance to watch it.",N/A
166571,"I have heard people say that they do not understand why this film was seventh on the A.F.I 100 Greatest American Film Movies list so perhaps I can tell you what I think.  When this movie came out the Committee for Un-American Activities had just completed their search of Hollywood for communists.  In the 50's this was a big deal and people in the business were blacklisted form working in Holywood as a result.  The director of this film, Elia Kazan, and it's producer, Lee Strasburg, both reportly gave names to the committee.  This upset many people.  After Kazan made On the Waterfront Terry Malloy's struggle became a metaphor for this time in Hollywood.  It was a very bold statement at the time.That being said, this is also a fantastic movie even if taken out of that context.  Marlon Brando plays Terry Malloy, a longshoreman, who does a favor for teamster boss Johnny Friendly which leads to a neighborhood friend, Joey Doyle, getting murdered.  Joey was going to testify against the union that controls the docks.  Terry will soon face a similar dilema when he is approached about testifying.  Terry has become interested in Joey's sister(Eva Marie Saint), but his brother(Rod Steiger) works closely for the Union leader.  Eventually his struggle will come to a head.This movie is great I don't really want to reveal too much about the plot.  The story is timeless and very compelling.  The performance from Brando is one of the greatest of all time(he won best actor).  This film has stood the test of time and should be seen by any fan of cinema because it is quite an achievement.",N/A

256010,"First of all, let me make it clear that I would love to give this DVD five stars, however, small flaws prevent me from doing so.Features:  The content included on the double disc pack is absolutely incredible.  The  inclusion of both the directors and editors cuts along with the documentary  and storyboards shows a real attention to detail on behalf of the producers  of the DVD.  The documentary is both entertaining and informative, worth a  couple of viewings alone, and puts other &quot;featurettes&quot; to  shame.Picture:  My only gripe is with aspects of the picture quality.  The dark tones and subtle contrast of the underwater scenes do exhibit a  digital &quot;feel&quot; at times.  Although the effect is quite subtle, it  is far more apparent than what you would expect from a production of this  calibre.  I watched the film on a 21&quot; Sony TV, and, given a larger  widescreen model, I do think there is a distinct possibility of the  digitization being distracting at times.Overall, although I have only  given this DVD 4 stars, I do have to recommend it strongly. The design and  content of the disc illustrate exactly what the DVD medium should always  offer.  In terms of production, it puts the additional features of most  DVD's to shame.  Having said this, I cannot ignore the small flaws in  picture quality, which have marred and otherwise perfect production.  -Richard Shaw",N/A

His spirits renewed, he decides to attend a revival meeting at the temple with his landlady.......... This 1931 feature was a well-directed slam at commercial evangelism with a personal sock at Aimee Semple McPherson and her Los Angeles tabernacle.

It's beautifully lighted and photographed and Barbara is mesmorizing in the lead as Florence &quot;Faith&quot; Fallon. An expensive film in it's day, every penny shows on the screen.

It has been depicted in numerous comics and games since the movie was released. A very original and creative character. This a very entertaining movie, and a great one to own.

89489,"Okay, I'll admit it.  I watch just about every Arnold Schwarzenegger movie that comes out.  I've even bought his Encyclopedia of Bodybuilding. With  truly Olympian fortitude, I even sat through &quot;Jingle All the Way&quot;  with my kid.  I'm a fan.  There, I've said it.That's why it grieves me  to pan this movie.  This flick asks you to suspend disbelief just a little  too much.  Well, A LOT too much, truth be told.Arnold plays a U.S.  Marshall, who works alone.  His job description is more that of a special  operations soldier, who seems to leave very few laws unbroken.At the  very beginning of the movie, for instance, Arnold whooshes into the house  of a mobster in the Witness Protection Program who is about to have his  tongue cut off by bad guys. Arnold is alone, dressed in black, and  well-armed.  He kills two bad guys in self-defense, and executes another on  the front lawn. Prior to arriving here, he has stopped by the morgue and  stolen two corpses.What else does he do?  He hides the heroine, played  by Vanessa Williams, in New York City, and as he's leaving, casually hands  her pistol and says, &quot;All you have to do is pull the trigger.&quot;  Yeah, right!  NO COP would EVER do this!  I don't know how many laws he  broke there, but it had to be at least a few.Throughout the movie, he  shoots first and asks questions later, if he asks them at all.  He is  mistaken for &quot;mole,&quot; and has hordes of federal agents pursuing  him.  He never questions whether they are all genuinely corrupt, or if are  following orders, believing him to be a bona fide suspect; he happily blows  them all away.  And at the end of the movie...well, I'll let you see that  and judge the believability of it for yourself.This movie does have some  funny lines, and the scene in the zoo with the marauding alligators is  great.  How much you enjoy this movie will depend largely on how easy it is  for you to overlook the fact that a federal agent commits felony after  felony after felony, apparently oblivious to the law.",N/A
377298,"If you want to see what makes a great anime film, you don't have to go beyond Ninja Scroll - It's ultraviolent, fun-to-watch, and inventive  movie. Set in Feudal Japan, the film follows the character of Jubei, a  masterless ninja for hire, as  he finds himself in the middle of a  conflict he wants nothing to do with. A mysterious disease has wiped out  the town of Shimota. A band of ninjas sets out to  investigate reports of  a band of men who fled the town shortly before everyone died. As they  approach the town, a rock-like creature slices the entire band apart, save  for Kagero, a female  warrior, whom he captures and rapes. Jubei saves her  and finds himself attracted to her. Alas,  she cannot be his as she is  literally poisonous.Jubei strikes out on his own again and his  approached by Dakuwan, a elderly ninja spy.  Dakuwan explains that the  rock monster that attacked the ninjas was a Devil of Kimon, of which  there are seven more. Dakuwan poisons Jubei and promises to give him the  antidote only after  he helps Dakuwan find and kill the remaining Devils  of Kimon.The fight scenes are absolutely top-notch. The video's  boxcover promises a &quot;bloodbath&quot; and  that's no exaggeration at  all. Arterial spray is present in virutally every fight scene. As is the  case of most anime I've seen, this isn't for kids. Along with the blood,  there's quite a bit of sexual  content too. The film's not rated, but it  would probably earn an R rating. The screenplay is the work of Yoshiaki  Kawajiri, who also directed. He succeeds in bringing a  fair amount of  emotional backdrop to the story, as these characters have more feelings and  motivation than many Hollywood big-budget movies' characters ever do.

474270,"First of all....I really liked it. While many of you may be turned off imediately by a film with a title like &quot;Stigmata&quot;, this is a great film. Stigmata is about persons with a deep religious faith who take  on the outward signs of crusifixtion as Christ did. These people develop  thorn cuts on their heads, bleed from the hands and feet, and wounds in  their side. This is a film that brings elements of possible demonic  possessions with the response of the Catholic Church. At times the audience  may wince at the gore but also be entertained at how it is presented. As I  sat watching this film, I wondered what I would do if I encountered a  person floating in the air hanging on an imaginary cross....would calling  911 bring the relief or help I seek? I could just imagine a Milwaukee cop  showing up and quickly leaving (but still having enough time to stop and  give me a parking ticket first.) This film will cause you to wonder....do  these things really happen? Do other religions other than Catholics have  stigmatas, and how come they don't make movies with non-Catholic priests  responding....here comes Jim or Tammy Faye to take care of a demon, now  that might sell. The film is well done, it keeps your attention, it  challenges you, and is well acted and filmed. Bottom line...if you are  looking for a thriller that leaves you questioning a few components of your  personal faith, then this film is for you.",Stigmata VHS
116387,"I went to see this movie with very high expectations, and found it failed to live up to most of the hype.  The fan hysteria over this flick is  completely incomprehensible to me -- I don't understand why this  outperformed the comparable Pitch Black or the superior Dark  City.Although there were some pretty computer effects and some exciting  fight sequences, the movie wore out its welcome quickly.  How many  explosions/actors fighting in flight harnesses/slow-mo gunplay does one  movie need?The plot and the visuals are recycled from better movies --  Blade Runner, Akira, Alien, even old Star Trek.  This movie doesn't have an  original thought in it -- it's just a blended puree of Anime, Kung Fu  movies, and old sci-fi.  I always giggle when I read about the &quot;deep  allegory&quot; of the film.  It's just a little Christ-figure with a little  Eastern Philosophy, and it serves as no more than window-dressing to an  essentially mindless movie.The weakest link by far is Keanu Reeves in  the lead role.  He has all the charisma and acting talent of a piece of  celery.  He's also got the wrong build for a hero -- when he starts  martial-arts posing he looks like a 98-pound weakling flexing in front of a  mirror.  I found myself laughing through most of his &quot;serious&quot;  scenes.Maybe the rabid fandom for this mediocre movie pushes me from  indifference to dislike, but the more people gush about this flick, the  less I like it.  It plays like some corporation's idea of cool, a  calculated attempt to make teens go &quot;Wow.&quot;  For that reason, it  occupies the same entertainment strata as N'Sync and Britney Spears.",N/A
473850,"I'll admit that I was one of the skeptics who groaned when HHH issued the challenge of a 60 Minute Iron Man Match to The Rock for JUDGMENT DAY 2000.  Now I have enormous admiration and hell, even favoritism, towards HHH and reserve just as much praise for The Rock.  In terms of athleticism, stamina, and ability to entertain the fans, they never fail to disappoint.  Yet was this a match they were ready to handle?  More importantly, was this a match that could hold the audience's attention?  I'm glad to say that the night of JUDGMENT DAY, I was left in about as much awestruck as I have been ever left in this whole year after any PPV.  I said this the second the Pay-Per-View finished, and I'll say it again: THIS PAY-PER-VIEW KICKED MAJOR @$$.As we know, Stone Cold Steve Austin was instrumental in costing HHH the WWF title to The Rock at Backlash.  About a week later, a pissed off HHH challenges The Rock to the match everybody in the locker room is afraid to do, and while most people are thinking of the Hell in a Cell, we're all in for a surprise when he reveals that it's a 60 Minute Iron Man Match.  So the match is set, right, and we have about two weeks left til the Pay Per View.  But wait ... in another shocker, the Heartbreak Kid Shawn Michaels comes back the week or so after HHH's announcement and declares that he is retiring from his position as WWF Commissioner, but not before guest refereeing the Iron Man Match.  On a personal note, I thought if the writers were going to bring HBK back at a certain point following his anti-climactic appearance at the first ever Smackdown!, this was an excellent time to do it.  And if you don't know the significance of HBK and him refeering the Iron Man Match, then you need to brush up on your WWF knowledge.  And no, it has nothing to do with HBK and HHH being two of the original D-Generation X members.  But anyhow, the match is set.... and whether or not the match is anybody's cup of tea, it's gonna happen ....The Pay-Per-View's opener of Kurt Angle and Edge &amp; Christian vs. Too Cool and Rikishi is some awesome entertainment, not to mention some hilarity from the heels before the match starts as they crack on the Kentucky folks.  The European Title Match between Eddie Guerrero, Perry Saturn, and Dean Malenko is also enjoyable, in terms of wrestling.  Dudleys vs. DX in a Tables Match was surprisingly good, too, even though I wonder just why in the hell DX had to go over, seeing as how they were on life support as it is.  X-Pac and Road Dogg are seriously awful heels, and their lack of crowd heat, not to mention overshadowing from the new major talent, would nil the future of these two men.  Shane McMahon vs. The Big Slow isn't really much of anything, but hey, Shane O Mac got to win over The Big Slow, and this kept the no-talent Slow out of the WWF scene for a couple months!  Yeah, Shane O!  The Benoit/Jericho submission match is not WrestleMania XIII's Austin/Bret, but hey, Canadian wrestlers kick @$$ and while HHH and The Rock headline the Pay-Per-View, I wouldn't be surprised if these two were the next superstars to helm the Iron Man Match.  Bravo for that match.Now the main event.  In a match where the number of falls have to be measured, and spots have to be made in strong accordance with the time, this one pulls all those with attitude.  The Rock and HHH pull off what is, in my opinion, their strongest match together ever.  I was completely on the edge of my seat that night, and remember with fondness how these guys just DESTROYED each other.  While many argue that this Iron Man Match can't touch the original, I heartily disagree.  The Rock and HHH proved why they were the top performers in the business, and did it with style.  This match had just as much intensity and excitement as the original, with an expected WWF Attitude sort of ending, which I might add features the return of the Undertaker.  And he has a new gimmick, too.As with WRESTLEMANIA XII's Iron Man Match, I'd say that if you didn't have the attention span or patience to see wrestlers at it for 60 minutes, I doubt you'll find much more interest in this.  However, I still maintain that this is one of the best Pay-Per-Views the WWF has ever pulled off, and hope that they have shows like this all the time.",WWF: Judgment Day 2000 VHS

Al Pacino gives an unforgettable performance in this movie as does Robert De Niro.  Francis Ford Coppola's use of the two story lines going at the same time is wonderful.The Robert De Niro (Young Vito Corleone) story line is the only part of the Godfather novel that was left out of the first film and it shows the rise of the Godfather.

528751,"Despite the fact that this film is a totally unoriginal and predictable retread of a dozen ""losers to winners"" sports stories, it is so hysterically funny that I didn't even care.  The story is thin at best.  The NFL is having a players strike and scabs are called in to finish the season.  Our heroes are low on ability but high on desire and peculiarity.  The quarterback, Shane Falco (Keanu Reeves), once had a promising career, but he fell apart psychologically when his team was pummeled in a college bowl game and he was labeled a player that folds in the big game.  Of course, while visiting the NFL, Shane falls in love with the head cheerleader (Brooke Langton) who never dates players (except of course this once).All this is merely a mundane excuse for a raucous and silly comedy that has some sidesplitting moments.  To enjoy this film you really need two things.  You need to love football and you need to enjoy slapstick, banana peel comedy.  I realize that this limits the audience considerably, but for those who qualify (and I am one), this movie is a scream.Director Howard Deutch (Pretty in Pink, Grumpier Old Men) did a great job on the football sequences.  He hired 45 professional football players (Former NFL players, Canadian Football League, etc.) to do the football scenes and sent the actors to a three-week football camp.  The action looked real because it was real.  The players were told to play and hit the way they normally would.  Of course, the plays were choreographed, but they were real football plays.The comedy was lowbrow, outrageous and crass, with a great deal of physical comedy.  The cheerleader scenes were a riot, especially the cheerleader tryouts.  The scene where they started pantomiming sex acts to distract the opposing team was priceless.  There was also sharp-witted football humor that required more than just a passing knowledge of the game.There isn't much serious that can be said about the acting.  Keanu Reeves tried to play an earnest comeback and romantic role amidst all the foolishness and it really didn't fit with the rest of the film.  However, he was an excellent athlete.  He did most of his own on-field shots and looked very believable as the quarterback.  Gene Hackman was good when he was making snappy wisecracks, but his inspirational ""Hoosiers"" imitation was misplaced.This film really belonged to the supporting actors like Orlando Jones (Clifford Franklin), Michael Taliferro and Faizon Love (The Jackson Twins), Ace Yonamine (Jumbo Fumiko), Rhys Ifans (Nigel ""The Leg"" Gruff) and all the cheerleaders who made the comedy work.  Jon Favreau gets a special mention as the crazy S.W.A.T. officer turned linebacker who took the wild man role to the next level.  The scenes with an incredulous Pat Summerall and John Madden were also fabulous.This film won't be fun for everyone, but it will have certain people falling off their chairs.  I rated it an 8/10.  Subtract two points if you aren't amused by slapstick and boorish behavior, and another two if you aren't a football fan.  For the rest of you, be prepared to split a gut.",N/A

482288,"&quot;Scream&quot; and &quot;Scream 2&quot; shamelessly satirized the horror movie genre in a stylish and popular fashion, but the same cannot be said for &quot;Scream 3,&quot; the final chapter in the trilogy of films. The same style and humorous fashion of the first two films is present in &quot;3,&quot; but the movie doesn't have the same element of satire. What it does have is an impressively suspenseful story with a likeable cast, even if its not as involving.The plot is basically the same with a few new characters and situations thrown in: someone is out to find the location of Sidney Prescott, who has been in hiding for quite some time. Cotton Weary's brutal murder is a message to the fearful Sidney, who is quick to disregard it as having anything to do with her, but when people begin disappearing off the set of &quot;Stab 3,&quot; the third in a trilogy of movies about the Woodsboro murders, she begins to take notice.And so does Gale Weathers, the news reporter who stops at nothing to get her story. She meets up with Detective Kinkaid, who uses her as a source for information. With her new legal loophole of investigation, Gale begins her investigation, running into Dewey, who is now working on the set of the now-suspicious slasher movie, as well as many other zany actors.The mystery surrounding the murders? Photographs of Sidney's mother are being left at the scene of each crime, photos that lead our group to believe that she may have been an actress. As the clues become more clearer, Sidney will have to face her past, and an unlikely opponent who has some close ties to her.Some pretty good material here, with fingers pointing every which way at each character. The movie ups the ante by involving more people in the plot, so that the identity of the killer will be a secret until the climax. It places Dewey on the set of the movie, along with the obviously suspicious actors, and even some of the police force come into play as possible murderers.But, as the movie starts knocking off people one by one, the possibilities become numbered, and that's when the puzzles begin to get harder. The movie throws clues and evidence our way so many times that when the final answer hits us, it's like a brick wall because its was so blatantly obvious. It's one of those mysteries that keeps us thinking, and then has us kicking ourselves for being so blind.But, for all its well-crafted mysteries, &quot;Scream 3&quot; doesn't have the same play on the horror genre as its sister films. The two previous outings played on all the old-school teen horror tactics used in films like &quot;Halloween&quot; and &quot;Friday the 13th,&quot; with characters spouting off dialogue about the rules of horror movies and sequels. Here, all we get is a videotape of Randy, who gives us a few rules that never leave a lasting impression. They just don't have the same effect on us here as they did before.Even still, the closing film in the &quot;Scream&quot; trilogy is an admirable achievement, a well-crafted thriller that takes some very nice twists and turns before revealing its true colors. It doesn't live up to the first two films, but it's quite a ride!",Scream 3

Howard Hawks was so impressed with James Caan who played his &quot;Mississippi&quot; role with absolute solemnity, saying that it made his character even more believable during the films many humorous moments. Robert Mitchum is superb, as are Christopher George and Ed Asner, but make no mistake this film belongs to John Wayne. His trademark laconic tough guy style oozes throughout the picture, and as predictable as the movie is, it is an absolute joy to watch over and over again.

227412,"This is such a great, yet highly under-rated sci-fi drama. Louis Gossett, Jr. is excellent as the alien and Dennis Quaid's performance is moving and extremely convincing. Sworn enemies, humans and this strange and highly  mis-understood race of aliens (Draconians) are at constant war. When Quaid  &amp; Gossett end up shooting each other out of the sky and falling onto an  uninhabited planet, they are forced to find common ground in order to  survive. While they first attempt to kill one another, they gradually  become reluctant friends and eventually blood brothers.  Draconians are a  very different species and there are no gender differences, so all  Draconians experience child birth. When Gossett's character finds himself  with child, a new dynamic is thrown into the story that shows the extent to  which Quaid will go for his new best friend. The scenes to follow are  moving and tender. Still sci-fi, but not a Terminator meets the Alien type  of film. Not your typical sci-fi, but fabulous nonetheless.  Why this isn't  available on DVD is beyond me.",Enemy Mine VHS
68393,"The framework is a major league baseball game. The memories are those of an aging pitcher, Billy Chapel, whose day is not going well at all. His team, the Detroit Tigers are out of the pennant race and expected to lie down like a dog at the behest of the New York Yankees. Moreover, the team has been sold and Chapel is expected to be traded to San Francisco when the sale is announced. His lover, Jane Aubrey, has told him that she &quot;can't do this anymore&quot; and she's headed to London and out of his life. As his catcher, Gus Osinski, told him, it's just not his day.We're often told that baseball is like life; it meanders and goes along paths we may not expect. And so it is with Billy Chapel, who is pitching his heart out while he relives his life, especially after a chance meeting with Aubrey on a bridge over the Harlem River. Her car has broken down and Chapel stops, ostensibly to help her fix it. Jane, being the cynical New Yorker she is, waves Billy off, but he's intrigued and he prevails on Jane to let him take a look under her hood. Aubrey gets behind the wheel, turns the key; nothing happens. Chapel reaches in, jiggles a wire or two and, to his fortune, the car starts. Jane is pleased and thanks Billy who admits he didn't really do anything. Of course, in a typical New York moment, the tow truck shows up and the operator more or less demands that Aubrey let her car be towed. Chapel uses the opportunity to invite her to a game he's pitching and dinner afterwards.Now, it might be thought that Billy Chapel is setting himself up for a groupie situation. After a night of passionate sex, that's exactly what Aubrey thinks as well and she wants no part of it. What follows is a recounting of how Billy and Jane come together and fall apart more than once.This is an excellent baseball movie, with wonderful dramatic stretches and also lots of humor. Kevin Costner, who's done a baseball movie or two in his career, is totally believable as Billy Chapel, a character who seem somewhat modeled after Steve Carlton in that he only wants to pitch to his longtime battery-mate, Osinski (John C. Reilly). Osinski knows Chapel's abilities well and he needles and cajoles Chapel to get the most out of him, not only on the diamond, but in life as well. Vin Scully and Steve Lyons of Fox Sports appear as themselves doing the play-by-play of the game we see unfolding before our eyes. Scully's dialogue sounds as if it sprang right from his mouth, the way he normally speaks. I'd be interested in whether his dialogue was written (most likely) or ad lib.If there's a disappointment among the entire production, it is the performance of Kelly Preston as Jane Aubrey. Aubrey, we discover along the way, has a past which would seem to explain her on-again / off-again relationship with Chapel. Not all of this is Preston's fault; some of it has to belong to screenwriter Dana Stevens who adapted a novel by Michael Shaara. The baseball scenario is near-perfection, but the treatment of the romance leaves something to be desired. Regardless, Sam Raimi's near-flawless direction of material we don't normally see him do, makes the entire film one to enjoy. It has excellent comic timing, yet marvelous dramatic sequence both surrounding the game and external to it. Basil Poledouris' original score heightened the drama and never detracted from the film.If you like baseball, you'll love this movie. Costner, who co-produced, must bring something extra to movies about baseball because of his love of the game. This film is one of those that truly has something for everyone and almost completely pulls it off. I heartily recommend it.[Originally reviewed on 18 September 1999]",N/A

Russell Crowe exudes strength, and intelligence, with a winning ability to lead men as empires fall at his feet.Maximus (Crowe), a general in the Roman army, has been slated by the reigning Emperor to lead Rome and return it to the people, removing it from the hands of the senate, which has ruled with duplicity. He finds himself betrayed by a pathetic, power hungry man. No longer a favored soldier, he is sold into slavery, where as a gladiator, his need for revenge grows strong, keeping him alive as he wins over the crowds in the gladiator's arena.The schemes and intrigue that takes place in the darkness of the night, along with the subtle threats that initiate the treachery among family members keeps you craving that justice which is robustly delivered by director Ridley Scott. The final showdown takes our hero to the infamous coliseum, where he faces an array of weapons and opponents. What a satisfying pleasure it will be to witness justice at its finest hour.This Academy Award nominated film is certainly a 5 star production and a movie that will stand the test of time.

I don't see how else the  performance could be played. It has to be that low-key, because Faye  Dunaway is taking up so much space, with her virtuouso turn as Joan  Crawford. Also, as Pauline Kael noted in her excellent review of the film,  &quot;Scarwid has good low tones in her voice which suggest the ordeals  Tina has been through, and she brings the role a twinkle, a gleam of rude  humor, that seems to sustain Tina through her mother's most fiendish  persecutions.&quot; At the end of the film, her character's unresolved  anger and sorrow is especially pungent to me. And all of you who feel that  doesn't ring true aren't being entirely honest about your relationships  with your own parents! Maybe viewers who appreciate the film only as a  &quot;camp classic&quot;, don't really want to acknowledge the tragic  realism of the material?

483373,"Originally, I have been against Direct-to-video(or dtv for short).  I watched the first &quot;Aladdin sequels,&quot; and those didn't quite gel for me.  Since then, I have turned away from them, but curiousity got the better of me and I rented Little Mermaid 2 (this would probably seem ordinary, but the fact is that I am a 20 year old guy who is working on an animation career).  I saw the first one when I was 9, and this one looks like it will carry a good load of fans.  In our story, the arrival of Ursula the sea witch's sister Morgana prompts Ariel and Eric to sever ties with King Triton and the sea to protect their daughter Melody.  But after entering her early teens, Melody begins to take on her mother's rebellious nature and venture out into the sea.  Melody is probably the most welcome new DTV character, inheriting her father's jet-black hair and her mother's expressive eyes.  She is also voiced by the incredible Tara Charendoff (who also voices Bubbles on &quot;The Powerpuff Girls,&quot; but don't worry, Melody doesn't sound quite as peppy), a 27 year old voice actress who convincingly makes us believe in Melody's adventures.  After finding a locket meant for her, Melody runs away, and Morgana (voicd by Ursula's villainous voice Pat Carroll) decides that Melody will be the &quot;perfect tool for Triton's undoing.&quot;  Probably most of the original's fans will find a big change in Ariel.  While Ariel was a somewhat rebellious 16 year old in the first one, here she's become a more responsible 28 year old mother (though she doesn't really look 28!).  Jodi Benson returns to voice her.  On the downside, the sidekicks who once made the original magical have grown up and lost their charm.  Scuttle (Buddy Hackett) feels like he was written in as an afterthought, and Flounder has an even smaller part where he tries to help as well.  Only Samuel E Wright as Sebastian is given a part that best befits his voice-acting. Two new sidekicks are Tip and Dash, a penguin and walrus duo who befriend Melody, but end up being carbon copies of most comic duos (ie Timon and Pumbaa).  Morgana's lackeys are even less pronounced, except for Undertow, a shark that got turned into a pipsqueak by Triton.  He provides a few funny moments.  The animation is choppy in some places, but does try to keep pace, looking much better than the &quot;Aladdin&quot; TV-style animation.  The soundtrack has a couple notable song tracks,(one a duet between Ariel and Melody) but in the end the background music is used.",The Little Mermaid II: Return to the Sea VHS

Spacek's role as the slow daughter who speaks in halting,  awkward speech rhythms is a masterstroke of character work, while  Farnsworth gives the signature performance of his career.

The film moves through different periods  of the families' life, and brings us to almost 200 years later, and Andrew  is still trying to become more human.  he even falls in love with a human,  and she, although she knows it could never really work, falls in love with  him too.  well, she never really declares her love.  but they spend time  together, and this is where the film starts to disturb me, a machine and a  woman are just happily in love?  and people are watching this with their  children?  i would never watch this with children, or recommend it to  families.  This is just a strange story, with some real philosophical  questions being asked. I really wouldn't call this movie Science Fiction.  It's kind of a comedy in the beginning, and then it just turns to mush.  The acting couldn't even save this movie.  Robin Williams is the only star  in this waste of film. I wouldn't recommend this movie to anyone.",Bicentennial Man

258639,"it's hard for me to drum up a 5 star rating for a movie about a bunch of spoiled, pampered prep school boys who have nothing but opportunity laid at their feet.  That's not to say that the rich and sheltered don't have  problems like the rest of us but I don't think that they compare, by and  large.That notwithstanding, it is a marvelous film with great  performances from all the players.  I was particularly impressed with both  Robert Sean Leonard and Ethan Hawke who really brought life to their  characters.  And all I can say about Robin Williams is that he is as fine a  dramatic actor as he is a comedian.I guess I also think the film angered  me because Mr. Keating (Robin Williams) was such a fabulous teacher but as  is so often the case anyone outside of the traditional faces tremendous  challenges.

Harlow is beautiful, Grant is handsome and both are hugely talented,able to play light comedy in one scene and affecting drama in the next.The story is not particularly well-str uctured - it tries a little too hard to please every kind of viewer in every kind of way - but George Fitzmaurice's direction is disciplined enough to drive the movie on in a brisk and and engaging manner.If you are an admirer of Harlow or Grant,then this is simply unavoidable.If you want to find out why either star is so fondly remembered,then try this (along with,say,Platinum Blonde and Dinner at Eight) for Harlow,but look elsewhere (at those movies from a year or so later,like The Awful Truth or Bringing Up Baby,or any others up to 1966) for Grant.If you just want to see an entertaining, unpretentious black-and-white movie from the mid-thirties,then this is well worth giving a try.",Suzy VHS

The acting was wooden and amateurish; particularly Jake Lloyd as Anakin who was insufferable to look at on screen (sorry kid!).  The rest of the cast obviously found it very difficult to rise above a  mediocre script with childish dialogue.  The directing and pacing were  uneven and showed Lucas' long time away from the chair.  The vaunted  computer special effects looked as if they were computer special effects,  which did nothing to suspend my disbelief.  Lucas' hackneyed use of cliches  have become extremely tiring, as well as his elitism.  And, yes, Jar Jar  was especially annoying.  The only cool thing was the three-way fight scene  but even that cannot pick the movie up from one star.  I guess Jedi Knights  do not bleed after being hit in the gut with a light saber... how  convenient indeed!Finally, the lack of a DVD release until 2005 just  shows Lucas' contempt for his audience and his worship of money.

486660,"Usually I'm a sap for romantic comedies and I give them a lot of latitude.  It is hard to come up with much that is fresh in a genre that has been so thoroughly plowed.  However, this charming and schmaltzy film was too corny even for me.  Romantic films are normally pretty predictable, but this was ridiculous.  Writer/director Bonnie Hunt gives these characters the depth of a rain puddle.  The plot was so scant that she had to employ excessive filler with farcical skits involving Jim Belushi, and the seniors led by Carroll O'Connor and Robert Loggia.  The fact that the filler was the most entertaining part of the film speaks volumes about the weakness of the main storyline.Bonnie Hunt's directorial debut was a mixed bag.  She captured some endearing moments and her choice for Chicago locations was wonderful.  However, the film's pacing was poor, with numerous dull scenes and a bumpy flow.  The character development of Bob (David Duchovny) and Grace (Minnie Driver) was good, and the romance was enchanting, but there really wasn't that much of an impediment to the relationship.  A truly great romance requires an insurmountable obstacle or irreconcilable differences to be overcome to test the awesome power of love.  The heart transplant device, while novel, really wasn't much of a reason for them to break up.  Hunt also should have made greater use of the device examining its implications more explicitly with Duchovny's character.  She was content to dance around the fact that the two loves of his life had the same heart, a wonderful metaphor that she left in the background rather than developing it.The acting was excellent.  David Duchovny proved to be quite affable in this retreat from the heavy-handed X-Files roles.  This may be the most he has been allowed to smile in any project he has ever taken.  It was enjoyable to see another side of him.  Minnie Driver gave a marvelous performance, probably her best to date.  She was very human; she was insecure about her surgery, but warm and full of hope.  Carroll O'Connor was priceless as Grace's grandfather.  He and Robert Loggia delivered some of the funniest moments in the film.  James Belushi was also hilarious as the overwrought dad and middle class stud muffin.Though it proved to be a crowd pleaser, this film was a sweet but lightweight addition to an overcrowded genre.  I rated it a 6/10.  It's a good date movie but not much more.",N/A

456641,"It is a shame this movie wasn't a bigger hit--largely because it deprived moviegoers of more cinematic pairings of Dennis Quaid and Ellen Barkin, a couple whose on-screen chemistry approached that of William Powell and Myrna Loy. The sex scenes here are truly steamy, yet used as much to establish character and advance the story as to titillate the audience. Quaid portrays a casually corrupt homicide cop on the New Orleans PD who is forced to rethink his life when (a) Barkin, a DA he's seriously attracted to, refuses to have anything to do with him, and (b) he discovers that the corruption in the department vastly exceeds anything he ever imagined. The movie may be &quot;Show Me the Money&quot; at the beginning, but at the end, it's &quot;Show Me the Remorse.&quot; The plot of a man reformed by the love of a good woman lost popularity as the 20th century progressed, but Quaid, Barkin and director Jim McBride deserve credit for updating it in a fresh, surprising and sexy way.",The Big Easy VHS

The sound and the realism of the u boat was amazing!  I felt  like I was right their in the boat.  At times I was even starting to feel  claustrophobic!The characters of the movie were very likable.  I could  really emphasize with their fear, intense panic, restlessnes, desperation  and hope for survival.  I cannot imagine living with the fear of being  attacked and dieing 24 hours a day, the way they had to.This film really  showed me how senseless and crazy war is.  It was very clear that the  Germans in this ship killed only because they had to.  They were certainly  not ruthless, mechanical killers.  They were human beings, with wives and  girlfriends.  It was not their fault that they were fighting for the wrong  side.  They were only obeying orders.About half way through the movie  they were given orders to go on what amounted to a 'suicide mission'.  The  sailors knew this too, but they had no choice.  I cannot begin to imagine  how it would feel to be sent on a mission that was probably going to kill  you.There is a real surprise ending to this movie.I watched the  'Directors Cut' version, dubbed in English and I highly reccomend that you  see it.

205593,"Most of the peculiar piquancy of this film comes from seeing two unfamiliar figures among all the good old stock types-Marlene Dietrich doing a parody of herself in THE BLUE ANGEL and Jimmy Stewart, a Mr. Smith going to a rough old-time Bret Harte town instead of to Washington. Marlene flounces around with great gusto and sings in that whiskey sublimation of contralto that's more fun than any metropolitan songbird. Stewart is drawly and slow-motioned, and always being bamboozeled, but you know that in the end, he is sure to unleash a streak of cunning and quick action and confound everyone. One of the most unusual pairings in the history of the screen worked like a charm for Dietrich and Stewart. As Frenchy, 38 year-old Dietrich is painted, tough and brazen the role revived Marlene's fading career (the public was tiring of her suffering glamour-puss roles) and it holds up as one her finest moments on film. As Tom Destry, Jr., Steward is polite, shy and awkward and their personalities contrast beautifully. The fight between Frenchy and Lily Belle (Una Merkel) is good fun and there's her classic ""See What the Boys in Backroom Will Have"" bit - Frenchy's death scene is truly affecting-something which is an attribute to Dietrich's acting ability.",Destry Rides Again VHS

477929,"When I first heard of the rumors that 'Remington Steele' actor Pierce Brosnan was tapped to play James Bond I felt that the series was in for a good dose of adrenaline it had been lacking in for about half of the Roger Moore films.  But the producers of 'Steele' wouldn't let Brosnan out of his contract, and sorry for us Bond fans, but we had to wait an agonizing 2 more films before they got around to FINALLY securing Brosnan.  This is the role he was BORN to play, and 'The World Is Not Enough' stands side-by-side (in MY opinion) with any of the Bond films of old.The opening scene alone is just about the BEST of ALL the Bond films and for that matter pretty much ANY film I have ever seen. Ever hear of Sprint Boats?  Well they are miniature speed boats that can actually turn on a dime and the opening scene is a chase (what else?) on the river Thames in London which raps up at the Millinnium Dome and it'll leave you breathless.  While I had a hard time imagining one of the two leading ladies as an honest-to-goodness nuclear physicist, I STILL managed to find a LOT to enjoy in this, I believe the 19th outing for the super-spy.  Let's be honest: We DON'T see a Bond film hoping to stretch our intellect, now DO we?  We go 'cuz we KNOW we're gonna be in for a visual roller coaster ride with a pinch of adrenaline thrown in for good measure--shaken not stirred, please.  This film does NOT disappoint in THIS particular arena.

I've watched this one at least 20 times  and I never get tired of it (the film's comedy routines move at such a  frantic pace, it'll seem like, every time you view it, you'll hear a joke  you missed beforehand).  One low point: the song by Lillian Roth, directly  followed by a harp solo by Harpo - it bogs the movie down a bit (maybe if  they'd split them apart, it would've helped a bit).  But any film with the  Marxes and Margaret DuMont is worth owning - to me it's reasonable to say  she was as important to the brothers's films as they themselves were.  This  is the film which features Groucho's famous African monologue, and one of  the things I noticed about this was how risque some of his statements were,  knowing what was considered censorable in Hollywood in those days (his  &quot;native girls&quot; line stands out to me as an example of this).  Also of note is the hilarious scene where the valuable piece of art,  &quot;Ze Bogard!&quot; is stolen and Groucho plays the detective - how  DuMont ever kept that poker face of hers is a mystery to me (it'd have  taken me several hundred takes, at least).

514788,"Summer of Sam, for a guy like me, is a movie I really look forward to seeing, but then when I sit down and actually watch it, it is nothing at all what I expected.  This movie was definitely a mixed bag from my point  of view, despite the first-rate direction of Spike Lee, the great pop/disco  soundtrack, and the way the Summer of 1977 is caught on film.  The dancing  sequences are a definite plus (Sorvino had to have some sort of  appreciation for her moves).  Nonetheless, the length and constant  vulgarity (both of which usually don't bother me) catch up with all things  rendered and only pass for a mediocre movie experience.  Two more negative  reactions from the movie is the film's all-too-strong violence (point-blank  shootings) and sex scenes (shooting in a more-than-I-wanna-know style).The movie surrounds a group of friends in the Bronx, centering on the  main character, Vinny, whose constant cheating and lackluster lifestyle has  him thinking the Gods are working against him, and that he very well may be  the Son of Sam's next victim.  Mira Sorvino does her best with her role as  Dionna, Vinny's wife, but only succeeds to a certain level.  Adrien Brody  plays the bisexual (or homosexual--we never really find out) friend of  Vinny who returns from Manhattan as a punk-rocker that displeases his  friends he grew up with.  Long story longer, this movie tries to please but  comes short.  I myself tend to like films like this where it captures a  time frame well and is presenting a story of flawed people, but all things  apparent still do not make this a very good or excellent movie.  It is  Spike Lee's best film since Malcolm X, but still, he could do a lot better  and could have done a lot better with this movie.I watched the film on  TV and was glad I punished myself to see it on TV so I would have to sit  and watch the whole thing.  Had I rented it I would stop it every fifteen  minutes and really lose the story's momentum and just wait for it to get  over, getting an even more ugly rendition of the film.

348447,"Until George Lucas cited this movie as one of the main influences for ""Star Wars"", it probably would have been remembered as one of Kurosawa's forgotten masterpieces--not as revolutionary as  ""Roshomon"", not as edgy as ""Throne Of Blood"", not as  epic as ""Ran"".  Fortunately, we have this film in public  consciousness today and we are better off for it.  The movie is remarkably  restrained for all the action that goes on in it.  Toshiro Mifune is at the  top of his game as the samurai who must protect his princess during  precarious situations.  Kurosawa's direction is quite honestly sublime,  particularly in his direction of Mifune (as usual), the two bumbling  thieves who must assist him more out of desperation than devotion to his  princess, and in particular his handling of the sword-fighting scene about 2/3 into the picture.  It is striking due to the flashy action  that does NOT happen--everything is in the body language of the actors, and it is great stuff.

There is no other comedian on the planet (Eddie Murphy is Hot on Jims tail) that can be as hysterically funny as Jim. He is a true geneous.

13547,"While the film is not particularly frightening, it is well done and should please most who enjoy a decent tale of the undead.The story centers around a high school student who discovers that a vampire and his personal aide have moved in the house next door. A series of murders leads the lad to initially investigate the goings-on himself, then later seek the assistance of his friends, then finally Peter Vincent (Roddy McDowel), fearless vampire killer -- hero and host of a local television show. One thing leads to another and eventually the vampire is killed -- the neighborhood saved. (ho-hum *yawn*)The film is humorous at times but the effects are well done and the story is about as unique as can be accomplished with a vampire tale. The DVD is clean and clear. &quot;Fright Night 2&quot;, an even better movie with the same general theme (our hero is now in college), has not yet made the DVD scene; but when it does you'll surely want to add it to your collection if you enjoy this one.Light enjoyment.

440508,"I first saw this film many years ago when it was a movie of the week on network TV.  Like any kid, I was interested in the battle scenes, and by the time I'd graduated with a Communications degree, I dismissed this movie out of hand as a faithful, but unexceptional telling of the Battle of Pearl Harbor.Mea Culpa!!  I finally saw this film in widescreen format, and this movie's artistic value magnified ten-fold.  The idea for this film was inspired: an American director would shoot the American scenes telling the USA side of the battle, and a Japanese director would tell the Japanese side of the story.  Originally the legendary Akira Kurasowa was hired to direct the Japanese side of the story, but after a falling out, Toshio Masuda ended up directing the Japanese side of the film.  Richard Fleischer directed the American sequences.Fleischer does a fine job, but Masuda is absolutely brilliant.  The Japanese side of the story is the more compelling side of the story, but Masuda truly does a masterful job of setting forth scenes of eloquence and power in telling the story of highly motivated people whose actions will doom their country.Despite truth being stranger than fiction, Hollywood all too often needlessly flushes historical truth down the toilet (&quot;JFK&quot; anyone?).  Fortunately, this powerful story is meticulous in its historical accuracy.  With a compelling muscial score and great special effects, especially considering the age of this film, this is a film which should appeal to movie lovers and history buffs both.IMPORTANT!! This is a film which can ONLY be appreciated in widescreen/DVD format.  The dogfight sequences, the impressive sets and much of the drama is lost in the version formatted for TV, resulting in the butchering of a masterpiece.",N/A
95430,"Barcelona is not really a comedy, but the dialouge sounds similar to Woody Allen anyway. Its sorta of nuerosis comedy/political drama/growing up film. What makes it special though is the two leads whom I've never seen before.  Ted is a romantic who talks like he's reading from a romantic novel, while  Fred is light hearted on the romantic front but enourmously sensitive when  it comes to anti-Americanisms by the locals. Its funny that Ted and Fred  are as ignorant about the local women as the locals are of America. The US  OF A has always been an easy target for critisism abroad for its meddling,  some are true and some aren't. That the film manages to include such  politics and remain relatively light hearted and free of anger is quite an  achievement.Although a development near the end threatens to indulge in  melodrama, Stillman stil manages to make it real and even funny. However,  to counter all the negativity about Americans the film sometimes (seems) to  stereotype Spanish women as promiscious/cold/leftists as personified by  MARTA(Mira Sorvino). I say &quot;seems&quot; becuase I've only been to  Spain once and never to Barcelona, if its true however, then that is  definitly the place to go next summer.",N/A
180383,"I sincerely don't know why people didn't like this movie.  Back in 1982, apparently almost nobody went to see what happened to be a breakthrough in CG imagery.  Without TRON, I think the possibilities of having computer-generated effects would have been remote.In spite of having certain flaws, the story of TRON presented some religious matters, like the programs wanting to communicate with their users -as if they were gods.  The light-cycle confrontation is one of its kind, with impressive angle shots never before seen on film.  Maybe Steven Lisberger's direction seemed a bit slow that the movie felt itself tiresome sometimes, bit it was a good effort.TRON was probably an underrated film.  However I consider it a very good movie and, on DVD, even better.",N/A

It is a  nearly three hour movie that goes by in an instant.Obviously, this was a  DVD that everyone was waiting for, and it was worth the wait.

527171,"Ahhh yes. Rocky &amp; Bulwinkle. Two wonderful cartoon characters from my  youth. I took my family to this movie the first day of release. As usual, I  wasn't expecting a whole lot from it, mostly because I figured it wouldn't  stand up well to the original series. Of couse it doesn't compare to the  series, and never could. However, I did end up enjoying the movie. The  reason is because they made a strong effort to stay with the style of the  series. Using a narrator who tended to stray all over the plot, using  immaginatative wordplay between Rocky and Bulwinkle, and of course the  wonderful characterizations of Boris and Natasha (played by Jason Alexander  and Rene Russo) kept me interested in what was happening on the screen.  This made up for a plot that was just a tad too silly, even for R &amp; B  standards. The most fun I had was listening to both my 7 &amp; 9 year olds  giggling throughout the movie.There are a few weak points though. One is  there is precious little of Jay Ward's wonderful humor that was directed at  the adult. This IS primarily a kids movie. Also, one thing I was extremely  disappointed in was the inclusion of two &quot;questionable&quot; words  that had absolutely no reason to be there except to display the actors  command of inappropriate language. The words aren't horrible, but they were  also not necessary either. What a shame!All-in-all I wouldn't hesitate  to recommend this movie to families looking for some semi-mindless  entertainment. Just remember, if you're a BIG &quot;Moose &amp;  Squirrel&quot; fan like I am, please don't expect miracles. Nothing will  compare to the original. As long as you remember that, then you should  enjoy the movie.",N/A

Nevertheless  the transfer is excellent and the sound is excellent.What can I say  about the episodes on the DVD? &quot;Mudd's Women&quot; is a very light,  simplistic story which does little for the series. Its watchable but is not  particularly good.&quot;The Enemy Within&quot;, on the other hand, is an  excellent variation on the Jekyll and Hyde story as a transporter problem  splits Kirk in two, unleashing a savage double on the ship.

67980,"In this story of American angst and family degeneration, Kevin Spacey plays Lester Burnham, father and husband, who hates his job, is getting fed up with his wife, and dislikes his life in general. One day, he snaps. He realizes how empty his life is, quits his job, and ceases to care about anything. He becomes free.First, the acting is among the best dramatic work you'll ever see in a film. Kevin Spacey (one of the best actors in film right now) and Annette Bening have some excellent performances. By now, we know that characters like Lester are the perfect roles for Spacey- cynical, attitudinal, sarcastic. The way he delivers his lines and acts is very impressive: managing to drop the subtlest notes of sarcasm and irony into his voice, being cool yet so acidic at the same time, and injecting his attitude with such cynicism and repressed emotion, he shows in this film why he's one of our best. Likewise, Annette Bening shines and is almost scary in how deeply she seems involved in her character, projecting her hyper uneasiness and the sense that she knows how pointless her life is, yet still tries to hide it.American Beauty discuss the image of the perfect American middle-class family, and the reality of it. In Lester's family and marriage, there is no American beauty. The film makes the case that true &quot;American beauty&quot; is probably not what you think it is- namely, not the seemingly happy family or guy with a nice job. But rather, real Beauty is to be found everywhere in life, if one simply looks for it. Lester snaps because he's intelligent: he realizes that his life holds no meaning for him, he hates his job, and his marriage is fake. Therefore, he quits, not just literally (his job), but figuratively (his former dull life), and tries to reinvigorate his life. He looks for Beauty.Likewise, Wes Bentley's neighbor, who falls in love with Lester's daughter, is an interesting and ironic character- he always looks depressed and dark, and spends his day simply recording mundane events, like a plastic bag floating in the wind. He shows footage of this meek, pathetic bag being tossed around in the wind, to Lester's daughter, because in this he finds Beauty. He is comforted by the idea that all of us, like the bag, are being tossed around in life, but that it's all in God's hands.I must mention how skillfully the film/script handles its teenage characters- they aren't stupid or caricatured, and they don't just mindly hate their parents for no reason, or anything like that. They are given personalities, and credibility (for we see, looking at Lester and his wife, that there may be a very good reason they don't want to be like them).This is part dark comedy and part drama, and I'm glad that, at the point when Lester decides to quit and do whatever he wants to do, it doesn't become a full-blown, cheesy comedy about a guy &quot;letting it all go.&quot; The film could've easily done that and turned into a series of comedy sketches involving Lester doing silly and wacky things with his freedom, but it didn't. (There are some times when it comes close, though.) Instead, it decides to create great drama out of it.This film makes a statement about American life and what it could turn into in extreme cases. It's about gaining freedom from an ugly, empty life, about appearances and the reality behind them. Take Mrs. Burnham. She's a real-estate agent, and she spends days tidying up a house in order to get a sale from someone; and when she doesn't, she breaks down. She's always busy doing something- cleaning, dusting, trimming the flowers, etc.- to keep herself occupied so that she doesn't realize the truth: that her life is empty. She never stops denying it to herself until the exciting climax. Lester, her husband, realizes it sooner; he comes to the conclusion that their marriage is simply an advertisement, a message to the world saying &quot;Hey, look at us, we're married, we're happy!&quot; And ironically, Lester's job (before he quit) was in advertising. Even his neighbor, the homophobic, strict, angry ex-colonel, has something repressed inside him.I must mention the excellent direction and cinematography for this film, which are impressive, from the sweeping pans of the camera to the surreal dream sequences Lester has when fantasizing about his daughter's cheerleader friend (rose petals, which come to symbolize the passion that has left Lester's life, swirl around her whenever he thinks of her).In short, the central theme of this film is &quot;look closer.&quot; If you think you see American beauty in our culture today, or if you think there is no real beauty left in the world today, look closer. Behind the advertisements, behind all the ugliness in this culture and life, look closer to find real American Beauty.",Belleza Americana American Beauty  VHS
243417,"One thing you've got to hand to Gerry and Sylvia Anderson. Not only were they on the forefront in terms of creating excellent science fiction with wonderous costumes, sets, and the like, they also create science fiction with an excellent, if not bizarre twist to it. Much like 2001 and Planet Of The Apes. They would go on later to create Space:1999(another science fiction classic).I first saw Journey To the Far Side Of The Sun at my grandmother's on a Saturday afternoon, watching it on the Saturday afternoon movies portion on one of the local television stations, and I must say that I was totally blown away by its plot twist. A mirror-Earth on the far side of the sun. And the explosive ending where astronaut and U.S. Air Force Colonel Glenn Ross(played by the great Roy Thinnes)tries to make an emergency landing in his spacecraft. The film was definately a quantum leap in science fiction. Especially with a plot twist that would have made a good Twilight Zone episode. Everything about this movie was great. From the plot to subplot, to the acting, etc. It is truly a cult classic among fans, especially those of the Andersons.Roy Thinnes, as always, does an excellent job with the material he is given. From an astronaut that has marital problems, to being in a weird and bizarre situation, he does an excellent job of playing someone who is in the most strangest of circumstances. The other actors also do an excellent job as well. The soundtrack by the late Barry Gray, very powerful and moving. Especially in the scene where Thinnes is in front of a mirror in the space center administrator's office, putting the pieces of the puzzle together.If you enjoy science fiction with a twist, be sure to check out this film.

After succeeding in training Banderas, Hopkins ventures to find his stolen  daughter, Elena, played by Catherine Zeta-Jones.

It's a work showing great promise and brilliance with a cop-out ending! It's a  floor wax! It's a breakfast cereal! Just scan through a few of the reviews  and you'll see these and many other opinions and interpretations of this  movie, all of them strong in their conviction that they are right. Some of  the greatest works of art inspire this sort of reaction.I am willing to  weigh in on the side of this being a great work. I found it captivating,  inspiring, and chock full of personal significance. For me it was a movie  about beating complacency and finding how you are most alive, not sweating  irrelevancies and getting to the heart of what you find fulfilling. It  makes a case for breaking free of what could be called a &quot;comfort  zone&quot; and scraping off the barnacles of a meaningless existence. It  did not promote total revolution, nihilism, or anarchy, but did speak to me  to encourage focus and &quot;letting slide that which does not truly  matter.&quot; I found personal significance because I had been letting my  life get pointless for the past few years, aimlessly stagnating in a dumb  office job and going through a series of predictably limited relationships.  My latest girlfriend had been getting on my case to clear out my room and  get a better job. So my next gig was with a show that toured for three  months, and while on the road I saw this. Meanwhile, she moved into my  building and then broke up with me and soon was dating one of my roomates.  This really helped me relate to the message that no one's just gonna give  you something, you gotta do something yourself. Live to the fullest. I  contemplated this as I lived a life of &quot;single-serving&quot; homes (a  different motel every night) and sought meaning in a life where my love had  left me for a so-called friend.To me, the story was about someone who  had fallen into an unsatisfyingly complacent existence and then discovered  something new that intrigued him. When his old life is irreparably  shattered, he turns to that intriguing new thing and finds that it empowers  him to take what he wants, even if he doesn't realize it. Of course there  are many levels to this, and many interpretations, but this is what it said  to me.I didn't get an urge to tear down society, but the movie did give  me a look at living life more fully and going for what you deserve,  whatever it is.",N/A

I don't  believe that the youngest boy had a crush on the older, as a previous  review said. He just looked up to him. Their nomadic lifestyle makes them  quirky. The funniest scenes are the infamous vibrator one and the one with  Uncle Mickey. It's a coming of age story mixed with wit and sexual  experimentation.",Slums of Beverly Hills VHS
67664,"It's hard to describe this movie to the uninitiated...but I'll do my best. It is the story of Lester Burnham, a middle aged suburbanite, and the neighborhood he lives in. Lester's wife is a relentlessly self-improving  real estate agent who is both envious of and lusts after her competition  (with results so hilarious her's could be counted as one of the greatest  lines in all of movie history.) Lester has no real relationship with his  daughter any longer and secretly lusts after her &quot;best&quot; friend  Angela...and this is just the beginning. From the introverted boy next door  who films everything and his militant father to the two Jims living on the  other side of the Burnham residence, this movie rarely goes where you  expect it to and provides scenes and speaches that are both heartwrenching  and hilarious. Look closer, and perhaps by the end of the movie you'll  agree with the boy next door: There is so much beauty in the world. Whether  the beauty is in the joyous or the tragic, it is there. And in this movie.  As I've stated, this movie defies description...So take from this feeble  attempt what you will.",Belleza Americana American Beauty  VHS

523289,"Gladiator is everything that a modern epic film should be. This film is a towering triumph that will not soon be forgotten. It features a very well-written script, amazing visuals, incredible moments of both action and drama, as well as absolutely stellar acting performances from the entire cast. Russell Crowe established himself as one of the best actors in the world today, with his commanding and emotionally powerful portrayal of Maximus, who is a hero in every sense of the term. Crowe deserves every accolade that he gets for his marvelous performance, which was by far one of the most commanding and heartfelt performances I have ever seen in a movie. Crowe's work in The Insider and L.A. Confidential made him a legitimate star, while his role in Gladiator cemented his position as one of the most prominent leading actors in Hollywood today. Crowe, an avid horseback rider, even did many of his own stunts in the movie. Joaquin Phoenix delivers a breakthrough performance as Commodus, the emotionally conflicted son of Emperor Marcus Aurelius, played by veteran actor Richard Harris. Phoenix's performance demands sympathy as well as hatred from the viewer, with gripping emotions as well as an ever-present sense of jealousy and spite. The late, great Oliver Reed(who died shortly before filming wrapped), put the finishing touch on a storied career with his performance as Proximo, the slave ower who helps Maximus regain his freedom. Connie Nielsen, a relative newcomer, also delivers an excellent performance as Commodus' older and wiser sister, who has had previous involvement with Maximus. The visuals in this movie are absolutely stunning, as ancient Rome is brought to life like never before with some absolutely amazing computer-generated visuals, as well as painstakingly crafted sets. Scenes of battle in this movie are graphic but never overindulgent, and convey a sense of the brutality that must have existed during this time. This movie is grand in both story and scale, and visuals serve to reinforce the strong acting by providing an unbelievable backdrop for the story. Ridley Scott, who is a master of skillful character filming, does not disappoint in what many people consider his finest film to date, as his skillful camera work gives a deep insight into the emotions of every character in the film. Gladiator is truly an epic achievement. Dreamworks did an excellent job with the Gladiator DVD, with some of the cleanest audio and video transfers I have seen on the DVD format. This movie was meant to be watched on DVD as the enhanced picture and sound really serve to heighten the experience of watching this movie. The DVD also contains nearly 4 (yes, four) hours of bonus materials including 30 minutes of deleted scenes, an HBO first look special, several commentaries, as well as a 50 minute documentary from the Learning Channel called: Bloodsport of a Gladiator, which examines the lives of actual Gladiators in ancient Rome. The inclusion of a journal by young actor Spencer Treat Williams, (who plays Lucius, the eventual heir to the throne of Rome)is n especially welcome addition. The DVD actually devotes a second disc solely to the special features.  The Bottom Line is this: Gladiator is a true modern epic, one of the best films ever made. It features incredible acting, a gripping storyline, and absolutlely stunning visuals. This movie is a must-have for any DVD collection. Movies just don't get much better than this.",Gladiator VHS
60124,"During the American civil war, wounded Yankee soldier, John McBurney is rescued on the verge of death by a teenage girl from a Confederate boarding school. She manages to get him back to the school, and at first the  all-female staff and pupils are scared. As he starts to recover, one by one  he seduces the sexually repressed women and the atmosphere becomes filled  with jealousy, deceit and brutal revenge.Eccentric, offbeat melodrama  combining the conventions of both Western and Grand Guignol chiller, and  directed as if it were an art movie, this is one of Eastwood and Siegel's  strangest collaborations. Beautifully shot (especially the nightmarishly  skewed first person camera perspective of that famous amputation scene, and  chiaroscuro lighting effects [such deep, dark shadows]}, carefully paced,  this is a haunting, elegant work that seems to have influenced the much  later - and inferior - Misery.No disc extras as such, but excellent  production notes, and a crystal-clear transfer with well-preserved colour  separation make this an essential DVD purchase.Now pass the mushrooms...",The Beguiled (1971)

Tommy Lee Jones looks as though he might be on the verge of firing his agent &amp; getting him someone who wouldn't keep casting him in these  roles.  Ashley Judd, beautiful to look at, had more to go with in terms of  character in the tiny part she had in Michael Mann's Heat. Even with all of  the plot holes and contrivances in the script, another, more savvy director  like Brian DePalma, Sam Raimi, the Coen brothers or Ridley Scott could have  delivered a movie with thrills.  At the very least these directors would  experiment with camera angles and different ways to try to get into the  character's psyche.  In fact, the rainy chase scene looked like Bruce  Beresford was trying to imitate Ridley Scott's eerie rainy chase scene in  Blade Runner.  What if, instead of Ashley Judd's character waking up in bed  covered wioth blood, she was awakened by the Coast Gaurd on the deck of the  boat, still covered with blood &amp; the knife in already in her hand.  This would allow the character &amp; the audience to question her sanity.  Shift the personal training &quot;Rocky&quot; rip-off montage to when  Ashley Judd first arrives in jail, as opposed to when she finally learns  that her husband is still alive, and you have a woman out to survive a  rough stay in prison, someone more likely to seek revenge when she learns  of her hubby's evil deeds. Mr. Beresford fails at this miserably, directing  the film with as much style and flair as a lesser made for TV movie.  One  that would be broadcast opposite the Superbowl.",N/A

These final few chapters bring  together all the past elements of the series, including some of the events,  which at the time may have seemed a little strange or unrelated, but now  can be explained, plus this DVD includes the pivotal final battle between  Tenchi and Yugi. If like me, you bought the first Tenchi in Tokyo chapters,  then simply had to buy the rest to follow the unravelling story, this final  addition will not disappoint. The quality of the animation, like the entire  Tokyo series, being TV derived is not quite up to the quality seen in the  OAV series, however it has a unique style and in some ways is more real and  the characters more expressive than seen in the OAV box set. I recommend  this Tokyo series to anyone who has the OVA set and wants more. The quality  may not be as good but the overall story, being slightly less fluffy makes  up for any other short fallings.

Is it a U.F.O. or is this country  bumpkin seeing things?

The bad guy did not seem all that bad, and you  just never really got all that emotionaly attached to any of the  characters. For instance, I think we were supposed to feel bad when Terri  Hatcher died, but I just wasn't...she just hadn't contributed anything to  the movie before she was erased.That said, there were some pretty  entertaining action scenes.

284858,"In the small but intriguing field of surrealistic musical films (which includes LADY IN THE DARK and ZIEGFELD FOLLIES), perhaps the most bizarre is director Vincente Minnelli's YOLANDA AND THE THIEF.The film tells the story of Yolanda (played by Lucille Bremer), a fabulously wealthy heiress in a fictional South American country. Having just left the convent school where she grew to adulthood, Yolanda is overwhelmed at the prospect of managing her vast estate. She prays for guidance to her guardian angel, but her prayer is overheard by a sly con-man (Fred Astaire) who decides to pose as the angel himself.The film's script--based on a story by Ludwig Bemelmens, author of the famous children's story MADELINE--is a strange blend of zany comedy and mystical fantasy. The most interesting (and, depending on the audience, perhaps scandalous) element has Yolanda falling romantically and erotically in love with the man she believes to be a heavenly messenger. During a moment of prayer, she tries to deny her feelings: &quot;Oh my angel. You know I could never even think of marrying you. . .&quot; Then she stops, realizing that an angel can read her thoughts, and that marriage is EXACTLY what she's thinking of!YOLANDA AND THE THIEF is photographed in breathtaking Technicolor. Its musical elements are fine, with choreography by the ballet world's famed Eugene Loring and songs by Harry Warren and the film's producer, Arthur Freed. Best tunes are &quot;Angel&quot; and &quot;Coffee Time.&quot; But the most striking musical moment is the 15 minute surrealistic ballet sequence depicting the thief's conflicted feelings for his &quot;prey,&quot; Yolanda. The ballet features huge, Dali-like sets, impressive costumes, bizarre effects, and an attractive but somewhat out-of-place song, &quot;Will You Marry Me?&quot;This film was intended to make Lucille Bremer a big star. It didn't happen. She and Astaire partner well, and she is strikingly beautiful. (She looks something like Bette Davis, if Bette Davis had been a tall, auburn-haired, glamorous show girl.) But she seems defeated by her role's acting requirements (granted, this role would have stumped anybody!). She seems most realxed and at home during her dance numbers, particularly &quot;Coffee Time,&quot; in which she and Astaire appear to be having great fun.You definitely have to be in the mood for something different to enjoy YOLANDA AND THE THIEF. But the movie is a fun reminder of 1940s pop surrealism, as well as of how strange commercial Hollywood used to get on occasion.",N/A
352542,"This excellent series was first broadcast on Masterpiece Theater back in 1975 and is based on the novels by Winston Graham.  It plays out much like an 18th Century soap opera.  Ross Poldark (Robin Ellis) is the story's  central character; after being injured during the Revolutionary War, he  returns to his home in England (Cornwall).  What he discovers ignites a  chain of events that is brilliantly designed to grab and hold the viewer's  attention until the very end.  You do not need an elaborate understanding  of England's history during this time-period to follow or enjoy the Poldark  series...it is no more than an countless string of captivating subplots  complete with daring rescues and dangerous liaisons, each carefully woven  to support but never overshadow the story's crux: a complex, intricate love  triangle that would stupefy Pythagoras himself.Overall, I found the  series to be more entertaining than Graham's books, which at times were  slow and uninvolving.  However, the story does not end with Poldark 2:  Graham continues the saga with several more books (including ""The Loving  Cup,"" which is currently out of print), but alas, except for ""Stranger from  the Sea,"" these were never adapted to the small screen.

Having said that, kung fu films relying on fantastical acrobatics and pervasive wire effects are an acquired taste, and I haven't quite fully acquired that taste.  Also, in a few fight scenes, the film has been &quot;speeded up&quot; ever so slightly, for effect... (to a purist- a no-no!)

Romeo must die has an ok plot, good acting and great fight scenes.Romeo must die is a martial arts version of, as if the title wasn't a dead give away, Romeo and Juliet.  In this movie, Han (Jet Li) escapes from prison in Hong Kong and comes to the US only to find his brother murdered.  While searching for his brothers murderer, he accidentally bumps into Trish (Aaliyah), who just happens to be the daughter of his father's primary rival.Jet Li plays an excellent little tough guy.  He is neither as wooden as Chou Yun Fat or as goofy as Jackie Chan.  He is, however, an excellent martial artist and a pleasure to watch in action.  Beyond being a great entertainer, Aaliyah's acting is also credible and she is absolutely beautiful.  There is obvious on screen chemistry between the two, however, it is never developed in the film.The supporting cast also make solid contributions to the movie.  In particular Anthony Anderson makes a great funny man as Maurice.  Russel Wong is an accomplished martial artist that helps Jet Li to showcase his talents.The DVD is a good buy.

120372,"I'm going to start out by saying that for the most part I did enjoy this movie.  There is entertainment here, and a fair part of the movie moves  along pretty good, but you feel as you watch it that it could be better.  And one way it could have been better, at least in my opinion, would have  been to have had more of Jet Li and Aaliyah in the movie.  A movie that has  a title Romeo Must Die, even though that's not Li's name in the movie,  still should have more of the stars in it.  It's when the two of them are  together that we get the best scenes in the movie.The two main  characters never actually generate a love interest, too much else is going  on for that to happen, but they are interesting in the way they interact  with one another.  Two of my favorite scenes are the ones where Han(Li)  used Trish(Aaliyah) as a weapon to battle a woman because he won't hit her  himself, and the one where he gets talked into playing football with some  of Trish's fathers henchmen.The main problem of the movie is that it  gets bogged down when Han and Trish aren't in it.  That's not to say that  some of the other actors don't do a fair job in their roles, but the plot  doesn't really support them.  The plot seems to swim in and out of focus a  lot, leaving you confused by exactly who's doing what and why.I have to  finish by stating that I haven't seen that many of Li's movies yet.  Before  this one the only other one I had seen was The Black Mask.  Just by  watching these two movies, I can tell Li can fight, and want to see more of  him.  I just wish they had let him open up a little more in this movie.  There were some decent fight scenes, one of the better ones in my book  being the one where he is strung up by one leg while fighting, but I was  still wishing for more.  Maybe next time.",N/A
366365,"I rented this movie one night based on a great multitude of great reviews it had received online.  As I popped the tape in my VCR, I wasn't sure what to expect.  Imagine my surprise as I began to watch one of the single greatest horror/suspense films ever made.  Everything in this film works, including the &quot;controversial&quot; appearance of the demon at the  beginning and end of the film.  The performances are quite noteworthy,  especially that of the actor who portrayed Karswell.  Niall MacGinnis does  a great job in humanizing his character and makes sure that Karswell is  leaps and bounds beyond the average evil villain in most horror films.  Probably my favorite aspect is the fact the film has a film noir quality to  it, which suits it fine, since it is a cross between a detective film and a  supernatural thriller.  It's one of the few films I've seen recently that  has made me yell at the characters when they do things  that may be  understandable, however they are a bit on the unintelligent side.  By the way, if you are a fan of  this movie, be sure to check out Hammer's The Devil Rides Out, recently  released in a widescreen edition by Anchor Bay Entertainment.  It contains  a similar occult theme, as well as the same level of sheer intensity.

47849,"The movie Apollo 13 is a wonderful look into a disaster that became a triumph. Based on astronaut Jim Lovells book &quot;Lost Moon&quot; and directed by Ron Howard this movie takes you within the first 10 minutes from the tradegy of Apollo 1, and the deaths of astronauts Grissom, White, and Chaffee, right into the Landing on the moon by Apollo 11. With that as a setting it will focus on the events leading to the disaster and through the heroics efforts of both the astronauts and the ground crew.Based on a time when America had become somewhat bored with Moon landings (although this was only the third scheduled) Apollo 13 takes you step-by-step through the story. Starting with the 3 astronuats (Lovell, Haise. and Mattingly) training for their mission and displaying the type of teamwork that is so essential to a successful mission, it then leads you to the last minute replacement of Mattingly by Swaggart due to potential health concerns. From there it shows the concern of Haise and Lovell as Swaggart tries to fit into their style. Swaggart never quite accomplishes this which would lead to a confrontation with Haise during the flight. The personnel of Mission Control are the real heros here though, from the leadership of Flight Director Gene Krantz to the efforts of every single person.The cast of Apollo 13 actually made the movie come alive. Yes, the special effects were great, but without the perfect acting jobs by the strong cast this could have fallen into documentry standards. Tom Hanks as Jim Lovell displays the confidence that you would expect from the mission leader. Gary Sinise as Ken Mattingly is wonderful, going from the excitment of pre-flight to the disappointment of being scatched from the mission to the results-driven savior. Bill Paxton, Ed Harris, Kevin Bacon, and Kathleen Quinlan round out a great cast.Having read the book before seeing the movie it's interesting to note that while the movie is about a 50/50 mix of action between the astronauts and Mission Control, the book is about a 75/25 split in favor of Houston. Both approaches are correct. In book form the author can take the time to go into detail of all the heroic actions and efforts that the personel of Mission Control had to do to bring these men home safely. In the movie it's best to cover the essentials. However if this movie was interesting to you I would HIGHLY recommend the book. It gives you great insight into all that transpired.",N/A

When Warner Bros. released &quot;Goodfellas&quot; on DVD it was one of the very first  titles released thats why the DVD is weak, after an hour you have to get up  and turn the disc over, very annoying.

81756,"The Wings of the Dove has a great scene towards the end where the two lover make love. Its sex without love or even lust but soaked in guilt and self loathing. It is a morosely erotic scene. Unfortunatley the rest of the  film doesn't match that level of intensity, but is a rather mechanical  exercise in love-triangle drama. This is strange as director (Iain Sofetly)  of Backbeat tries to break all genre conventions with kinetic camera work  and Helena Bonham Carter gives a wonderful performance rich with lust,  selfishness and guilt. Its rather inexplicapable then that the film never  truly reaches a take off point or a level of emotional involvment as for  example a slow burner like Merchant Ivory's Howards End and certainly not  even in the vicinity of their masterful The Remains of The Day. No this is  more similar to MerchantIvory's 1986 film A Room With  A View, also an  elegant film, also starring Carter that similarly fails to engage on an  emotional level.",N/A

The beginning starts off slow because they have to go into the  background stuuf and show u what's what. Once the action gets started it's  over because you wil be laughing from beginning to end. The part that had  me rolling is when Chris was talking to the terrorist and he told chris how  much he wanted for the girl. He said 50 million and chris said &quot;50  MIllion! ...who you think this is? ..Chelsea Clinton? &quot;..LOL. Don't  think that it's all jokes alone because they bring up some serious things  in the movie like how easy it is to smuggle certain stuff over to the U.S.  with the right connections. They also show how people judge you just  because you look or speak a certain way..til they see what your about(ex.  chris and jackie) If you didn't go to the movies for this then you won't  regret seeing this on video..or paying for it too.

The film is self-conscious and artificial, and unlike the director at his best, has absolutely no sense of humor. The fact is that Hitchcock played with &quot;Big Themes&quot; and his own obsessions in many, many of his films, without laying it on with a trowel. Here, there's not only a trowel, but a steamroller. Of course, even 2nd rate Hitchcock has its joys. But there's definitely &quot;less here than meets the eye&quot;.

473467,"I am such a huge fan of the film Braveheart, that my friend recommended this film to me. I was quite skeptic at first, because I was continually  compairing the two. However, I was soon lost in the dark, and nightmarish  world that John McTiernan had placed before my eyes. The action was very  fast paced, and there were plenty of sword fights and beheading. Of course  this film was not made on par with Braveheart, but so what! This film is  not Braveheart! I found this to be more of a Conan movie, which is fine by  me, because those are great films. Antonio Banderas was really well cast as  Ahmed, and the men who played the Norsemen were really great as well. I  heard the name of the king to be Hrothgar. And, if my literature memory  serves me correctly, then this tale could be said to be loosely based upon  the tale of the great Dane Beowulf. Although Beowulf was a good tale it was  boring at times and not an easy read. &quot;The 13th Warrior&quot;, on the  otherhand was a great movie, and a fine entry to the swordsmen epics. This  is a must see for fans of Conan films, and those who liked Braveheart's  action scenes. &quot;The 13th Warrior&quot; can be really gruesome at  times, but for the most part most of the fighting takes place at night so  not alot of blood could be seen. Anyhoo, this is a very fun film to watch,  and I promise that when the Wendol's begin their nocturnal assualts on the  small band of heroes, you will completely forget about Braveheart.....I  did!",The 13th Warrior
523142,"When Roman emperor Marcus Aurelius (Richard Harris) admits to favoring the general Maximus (Russell Crowe) as his successor, instead of his dishonest son Commodus (Joaquin Phoenix), Commodus takes steps to ensure that his father's wishes are never realized, to the detriment of Aurelius, Maximus, their families and to Rome herself.This beautifully executed, gorgeously photographed and wonderfully acted film is also (unfortunately) almost totally unoriginal. Avid filmgoers have already seen this again and again, even down to the tiresome clich&eacute;s like the perplexing convention that all nefarious despots seem be a tad effeminate. There will be few surprises for those who have seen such films as the two versions of Ben-Hur (1926, 1959), The Robe (1953), Demetrius and the Gladiators (1954) and Spartacus (1960), not to mention Anthony Mann's equally sprawling The Fall of the Roman Empire (1964) of which this is very close to being a remake.Ridley Scott makes it all palatable to modern audiences who have come to expect large doses of snazzy computer graphics and frenetic action scenes (with the concomitant sprinklings of realistic gore). Here Scott brilliantly employs the &quot;strobe effect&quot; photography which Spielberg put to good use recently in his Saving Private Ryan. Alas, some of these scenes are completely over-the-top, with Crowe easily disposing of five or six heavily armed opponents without even breaking a sweat -- glaring incongruities, and often unintentionally laughable, in an otherwise beautifully detailed and painstakingly accurate treatment.If you haven't seen the aforementioned films, this film may delight you from beginning to end. If you have seen those films, there is still lots here to recommend this film, though don't expect any surprises.",Gladiator VHS

116643,"&quot;The Matrix&quot; is a movie about the well worn science fiction concept of virtual reality. Morpheus(Laurence Fishburne) plays a leader of a rebellion in search of someone he calls &quot;The One&quot;.(This person  possesses the knowledge necessary to understand how to crack the  programming code for The Matrix) Reality as we know it is depicted as a  machine controlled artificial world where all that is experienced is  controlled and programmed by living machines that have human beings in pods  that are all connected to the central mainframe by a series of  interconnected materials.(What ever might be capable of sending  information) Life is an illusion that is presented by the Matrix. Morpheus  and a group of rebels that have escaped the Matrix, in a ship of some kind,  have pinpointed the location of Neo(Keanu Reeves) whom they believe is  &quot;The One&quot; with the knowledge. They eject him from The Matrix and  bring him aboard their ship. Morpheus begins to train Neo as to how to  fight The Matrix. While the concept for &quot;The Matrix&quot; is  interesting to an extent there are logical flaws that hurt the thought  provoking aspect of the film. One aspect has me completely stumped. In  order for virtual reality to really work wouldn't a subject(a person) need  to be unaware that they were in a &quot;virtual&quot; world. In &quot;The  Matrix&quot; there are members of the group of rebels killed while they are  in The Matrix when they voluntarily return to The Matrix. The problem is  that they are aware that they are in The Matrix. How can computer  controlled bullets and such harm you if you are aware that everything  around you is all just artificially created? As purely entertainment  &quot;The Matrix&quot; is pretty excellent but to provoke any kind of  thought process it doesn't make much sense. For entertainment value there  is a pretty great antagonistic cat and mouse battle between Neo and Agent  Smith, a virus in The Matrix out to kill Neo and steal the mainframe access  code from Morpheus for the last human city outside of the clutches of The  Matrix. Agent Smith says his life is empty and that secret information  would let him cease to exist.(Its worth the price of admission to watch  them battle it out) All in all &quot;The Matrix&quot; needs its harddrive  to be defragmented. The various pieces don't fit that well together and  should have at least been coherent enough to fit together. The ending is  very disappointing. Watch out for the &quot;I love you&quot; so you can now  wake from the dead Neo and Trinity moment.(Trinity, an important part of  the rebel squad, a take charge woman, falls in love with Neo for no  particular reason than it was destined by the Oracle, and pulls off a  reverse &quot;Snow White&quot;) What the heck was that?(I thought when I  saw it)Ask yourself, what is &quot;The Matrix&quot;?

Berkeley's lines were often delivered  in the same jerky, uneven, frenetic way everything else was choreographed.  Clearly not her fault.

68466,"Barnes' quest in his novel does not necessarily revolve around &quot;sexual boredom&quot; as Marion puts it, or a trite middle-class, mid-life &quot;self-crisis&quot;. It is a touching evaluation of a past,  with its odds and ends, an appreciation of reminiscences that leads us to  where we stand, where we exist and how we interact with others as well as  ourselves. On the other hand, Saville's depiction appears rather  judgemental. His view, unlike Barnes, polishes Chris' choice &quot;to eat  at the Ritz&quot;. We all feel, maybe sometimes desperately, the need to  belong to someone, that warm intimacy,  the comfort of loving safety.  However, what Saville does not answer is the point that whether we have to  be like Chris to admit this need, whether we constantly have to remember  our &quot;glorious&quot;(!), youthful past to realize that life's slipping  off our hands or whether being a &quot;rolling stone&quot; is always an  alternative for the petite bourgeoisie attitude. But in overall, if you can  keep yourself distant from Saville's perspective, the film is witty,  entertaining &amp; interestingly enjoyable. Maybe the only quote that  really exceeds the novel's cynicism is that when Marion tells Chris  &quot;You're not that original&quot;. Watson is great as the  &quot;sterile&quot; wife, always measured, very British. Zylberstein is  purely awesome! . Do not expect the novel as it is, for it is deformed.

There are some very amusing, poignant and tender bits in this film but as an  ensemble it lacks that bit of punch which is needed for this type of movie.  Hwever it is not at all melodramatic or over-sentimental thanks to writer  and director Mike Leigh's sharp observations on society and human  relationships not to mention a twist of tragedy.The characters are  well-written displaying flaws and strengths which make them so human and  Andy Serkis is very good as the yuppie owner of a flat the girls go to view  as is Mark Benton as their former flatmate.In regards to the lack of  sparkle, I think that comes from Leigh's inclination to produce tragic  dramas and this change of theme takes a bit of getting used to and is not  entirely successful.But don't worry if, like me, you love Leigh's work,  you won't be disappointed as his echoes of tragedy are still sharply  apparent and it is certainly entertaining.The more times I watched this  flick the more I grew to like it.

The game show host is like a satanic vesion of Hughie Green, Arnold is himself, and the ""stalkers"" are so completely crazy you think, my gosh, whatever I'm up to now can't posibly be so bad as this.I am intrigued by the fact that this movie appears as very much a family and friends production. Almost all of Arnolds friends are present, including the irreplacable Jesse Ventura. All the other big fellas have very strong mid - German accents and chances are they all trained together  a few years ago.The part that Jesse plays is very funny and quite self  effacing. He allows the game show host to humiliate him on several occasions and the character development for Cap. Freedom as a rather ageing crazy who is seriously beginning to doubt his current worth... this is part of the rather silly aspect of the whole affair. You can't be too upset by  any of it. Ventura has a tremendous capacity for comedy and I'm surprised he hasn't explored this more.There are many very distinguished members of the cast, such as Mick Fleet (from Fleetwood Mac), and even Dweezil Zappa, son of Frank, who got just one real line out of the whole movie -  but what a line! And I bet his dad was so damn proud, I can just see them both just killing themselves laughing over the whole thing.But, sadly, it is violent and sometimes quite crude. It has more nastiness than was really necessary, but in those days probably - I'm speculating - probably someone from on high required this.Since this movie cheered me up, I have a fondness for it that is probably out of proportion to it's real worth.Characters that could have been developed more - the ridiculously and well acted camp hairdresser that gets in the way of Captain Freedom and almost anyone else - the innocent floorcleaner - Dweezil and Mick, the old lady... several  others too.As far as I know, this also contains the first ""I'll be  back"".

Lee portrays a wonderful mummy, with a hint of Lon Chaney and Arnold Vosloo. The bandages are pretty  fake, but the mummy is very scary. Cushing delivers a fine performance as  John Banning. My only problem is the story, which is a slightly altered  version of Universal's THE MUMMY'S TOMB. The plot is a bit rushed and does  not give adequete time to make any of the characters really stick in our  minds( with the exception of Lee).Every main character's name was borrowed  from the Universal movies. The flashbacks to Egypt are very good. The  ending was an altered version of THE MUMMY'S GHOST. A more creative death  for the mummy would've helped. The makeup and score were effective and  chilling. Unlike many of Hammer's monster movies, there is no blood or gore  in this one at all!  That makes this enjoyable and a spooky, fun movie!",N/A

118556,"As with almost all of Kubrick's films, Eyes Wide Shut is a piece that is ahead of its time.  The reaction to this film is just what I had expected.  Time and time again, during the initial release of a new Kubrick film,  reaction is ALWAYS sharply divided.  The reviews are mainly negative and  the public does'nt seem to know what to make of the film.  Just go back and  look at the original reviews for &quot;2001&quot; when it first came out  back in 1968.  They're devestating.  Now the film continually makes many 10  best lists.  This goes for most of his films.  I think that the film will  stand the test of time (in fact some film critics who panned the film are  coming around already).  Today's moviegoing public just does'nt seem to  have the patience to stay with a film such as this.  Kubrick's multilayed  film requires one to &quot;think&quot; and work for its rewards.  There is  no question he intended to capture a dream state on film, hence the  unreality of the sets, the stylized lighting, the surreal masked ball, ect.  As with all Kubrick films, the atmosphere is tightly controlled, the  pacing deliberate and at times even langourous, the dialogue intentionally  repetitive, and the direction, so stylized and instantly recognizable that  there is no question who made this film.  The media had built up  expectations to the point of insane frenzy, no movie could have lived up to  that.  If you're expecting to see first class porn with A list stars and  very kinky hardcore sex scenes, you my friend are sadly mistaken and will  be disappointed.  But is you go in knowing this is a very surreal art film  you may like it.  Lastly, I feel the need to &quot;join in with the rest of  the chorus&quot;, I wish the unedited version would have been presented on  DVD. It's an absolute shameful decision on WB's part regardless of  &quot;Kubrick's final wishes&quot;.  An alternate version MUST be  presented.",N/A

Don't cut corners out of respect for him, this movie was an insult to the original.  I wish Hollywood would declare a moratorium on lousy computer generated effects.

While its origin in 1983 prevents it from being sonically 100%, the performances are simply fabulous! You'll see  why the ""three tenors"", Pavarotti, Carrerras and Domingo, deserve  the fame that they enjoy. You'll see and hear why Dame Joan Sutherland was  called ""La Stupenda"" by her fans. You will see and hear the most  ravishing singing of two scenes from Der Rosenkavalier, which will convert  even the most ardent operaphobe. You will marvel, as I did, how  sensitive  and youthful the late Alfredo Krause sounds in the love duet  with the  simply splendid Catherine Malfitano) from Romeo et Juliette. With nearly  four hours of marvellous singing, with arias, overtures, duets, trios and  ensembles, this disc will be replayed over and over at our house -- and  yours, too. My usually objective wife was clapping and exclaiming  ""bravo"" as the performances progressed, and properly so. Don't  miss this one; and its perfect as a gift for any opera lover or anyone who  is curious about what opera is all about.ADDENDUM: When I initially reviewed this disc, it was a release on Pioneer Classics, not the re-mastered DGG edition featured here. I just added the DGG edition and can update this review accordingly. The picture is cleaner; the colors are more intense. The DTS surround sound is the biggest plus for me because it provides some ambience that suggests a sense of ""being there"". It is not as dramatic an effect as is the case with the new HD technology, but it is a significant upgrade that amply justified the expenditure for the 2 disc set. My earlier comments on the quality of the performances is unchanged. It's a chance to see some of the Golden Age singers of the second half of the 20th Century.",Metropolitan Opera: Centennial Gala
68121,"An odd little sequel that really isn't a sequel at all.  The original  DRAGONHEART was a surprisingly sweet film Staring Dennis Quaid as a  reluctant, down on his luck knight of old, at first battling, then  eventually joining forces with a real live dragon (voiced by Sean Connery).  This movie keeps the name and the dragon concept but loses everything  else.  Made for kids, this is the story of Geoffrey (Chris Masterson), a  young stable boy, who dreams of being a knight.  By chance, he discovers  and befriends a scaly, rascally dragon named Drake (voiced by Robby  Benson).  Together, with some help from a mysterious Asian man and his  feisty kung-fu fighting ward, they seek to free their kingdom from the evil  influence of a ne'er do well advisor hell-bent on destroying Drake and  taking over the realm.I can't honestly see why this film was made  except maybe to capitalize on the kid popularity of the original film, but  it's a second rate movie at best with some lighthearted moments thrown in  here and there.  It's not that this is a bad film - it's just a bit  redundant.  I'd stick with the original to show your kids.

This disc, however, laid all fears to  rest.  From the opening moments of &quot;Green Earrings&quot;, I knew this  one was a true winner.  This disc features &quot;bang-on&quot; performances  from the entire ensemble...no slackers in this crew.  Where do they find  these guys, anyway?  Is there some top-secret underground facility that  cultivates and raises top-notch session musicians for Becker and Fagan's  private stock?  Hmmm..... Sound-wise, there are three choices of mix: Dolby  Digital 5.1, which seems to be the most balanced; DTS 5.1, which features  far better separation of channels, but typical &quot;overdone&quot; bass;  and 2- channel PCM Dolby Stereo.  The folks at Digital Theatre Systems  (DTS) seem hell-bent on demonstrating the extended headroom DTS is touted  to offer over Dolby Digital by trying to blast viewers out of the room with  bottom end.  While it works wonders for movies such as &quot;Saving Private  Ryan&quot;, it really is overkill here.  The Dolby Digital 5.1 mix is  well-balanced, and just about as good as it can get for a live performance.  Highly recommended for Dan Fans!",N/A

With the exception of Greenstreet and Lorre, the acting was pretty poor, especially Mary Astor's nauseating interpretation of Ms. O'Shaughnessy.  Maybe they just look bad in comparison to Bogart, or their performances are just a tad unworthy to do justice to the amazingly intricate screenplay and the highly original cinematography - but this certainly didn't pose a problem in Casablanca.

14801,"Films like this really annoy me. 'Urban Legend' had a great premise, had  an infinite store of ideas to play upon, and yet the execution was so  diabolical that it has ruined what could have been a decent film had  someone else written it. It's a real shame that it takes itself completely  seriously, because if it had been played as a camp comedy-horror it would  have been hysterical; instead, it's such a poor imitation of all the  reasonably good teen slasher flicks of the latter end of the 90's  ('Scream', 'I Know What You Did Last Summer', etc., etc.) that it's not  even funny. When something is so bad that it's not funny, then you know  something is seriously wrong. And it's strange that none of the cast and  crew (including horror veteran Robert Englund) realised what a duff movie  it was. Only Joshua Jackson seemed to grasp that it wasn't supposed to be  played straight, and he isn't exactly in it for very long. When the talent  is killed off early on, you know it can only get worse. And believe me, it  does.The acting is plastic in the 'hey Barbie, meet Ken' variety. But  that could be glossed over if only the story had been coherent. Tragically,  it's even worse, ripping off scenes left, right and centre and hoping that  nobody notices. So maybe the direction could save it? Think again. You  watch it and spend the whole time thinking: was that the scary bit, or is  this the scary bit? But that said, it is a whole lot of fun. Yep, me and my  girlfriend spent the whole car journey home from the cinema having great  fun discussing the various holes in the plot, some so big you can drive a  lorry through them. We got up to nineteen serious breaches of rationality  before we gave up, and that is the honest to God truth. Now, not giving too  much away, I feel I have to reveal one major irrationality that underlays  the whole film: the reason for the killings is that there was a car  accident and a young man died. So the vengeful killer, rather than  torturing the driver whose fault it was by killing off all her friends,  kills her and proceeds to subject the innocent passenger of this car to all  sorts of mental suffering. Does that make sense? More to the point, who  cares? By the time this is revealed, you're just gagging to watch the poor  unfortunate star strung up for her 'Barbie's plastic inanimate car' acting  abilities. Oh, and the killer overpowers several young, powerful men, an  old man, a security guard, and survives a fall from a third story window,  despite being somewhat lacking in both the size and muscles departments.  Odd that...I liked the way the events of this film become an urban legend  at the end, but even the execution of that scene is dire. If you want to  see a decent film on a Saturday night, don't see this. If you want to see a  hysterically bad film on a Saturday night, don't see this. Quite frankly,  don't see this on any day of the week, at any time, for any reason other  than as a step-by-step guide on how not to make a movie. But I have an  urban legend for you: did you hear the story about six youths who rented a  'scary' movie late one winter's night...they all slept really well and in the  morning demanded their money back.

11826,"&quot;When was the last time you saw a movie with an overture?&quot; I asked my friend, as the lights went down in the theatre.  We shared a nervous laugh, hoping that what followed could live up to this grandiose introduction, not to mention its reputation.  It does.David Lean managed to make a tight three and a half hour movie.  There are no wasted moments, no superfluous scenes.  The story moves forward with impeccable thrust, never offering a dull moment.  The greatest testament I can offer is that I didn't look at my watch once; and for someone with an attention span as short as mine, that's a major accomplishment.I was awed by this movie's epic beauty.  That sounds like an odd statement to make about a David Lean movie, but I was still surprised at how beautiful it managed to be.  The man really knew how to use a horizon.  The shots of the slow sunrise, of the Howitat and Bedouin caravan crossing the Nefud desert, of the fallen train, and especially of Sherif Ali's entrance riding his camel in from the distance, are all magical in their composition.  Not to mention the way he photographs Lawrence's piercing blue eyes and shiny blonde hair.  He looks the part of an angel.Besides being a skilled visual director, Lean also manages to be a great storyteller as well.  In a movie so full of drama, sometimes the evils of melodrama set in.  Lean manages to avoid this.  Even in the tensest of scenes, such as the ironic killing of Gasim or Lawrence's torture, he is very economic in what he chooses to show, never forcing the drama.  It is a very effective narrative.What surprised me most about the movie is its perfect use of comedic relief.  This comes from both the wit of Robert Bolt's script (&quot;You're a clown, Lawrence,&quot; he is told early on by a superior officer.  &quot;Ah well, we can't all be lion-tamers,&quot; he glibly replies.  A great line, that), and the foolish actions of some of the characters (such as Audar's perfect over-the-top buffoonery, and Allenby's gross military pomposity).  The humour is paced perfectly.  It never gets in the way of the narrative, and provides opportunity for further character development.All that being said, the greatest aspect of this movie is its impressive cast of actors.  What a great group of legendary actors we have here.  Omar Sharif is cool and majestic; Alec Guinness offers his wit and dignity; Anthony Quinn (almost unrecognizable) brings brutishness and charisma.  Even Jose Ferrer and Claude Rains in supporting roles add key elements to the picture.  And of course, Peter O'Toole is perfect as Lawrence, capturing all of his boyish charm, beauty, and British snobbery.  And eventually, he manages to capture his courage as well.For all of these reasons and more, this film manages to live up to its reputation as a great and entertaining work.",N/A

The dated presentation and production design really is quite distracting in the present day.Anne Heche and the wooden David Schwimmer play a couple in love who take a quick vacation to the South Pacific. Harrison Ford plays the grouchy pilot who flies them to their island resort. But a mishap leads to a plane crash leaving Ford and Heche stranded while Schwimmer has to mourn his lost love, leading to the not-so-shocking revelation that he the experience had revealed no character to him whatsoever. A fact that the writer tries to cover-up by not-so-cleverly working it into the dialogue.The dialogue and humor is cheap, simply, and easy. The music generic and dated. All this film really has going for it is some pretty scenery. They try to liven things up by introducing pirates 30 minutes from the end, but they seem unnaturally shoehorned in. None of them are given names, have barely 5 minutes screen time, and hardly any dialogue.The trailers promised an old-fashioned island adventure movie. What they actually gave us was more of a romantic comedy. There were action scenes featured in the trailer that are not in the movie. The running time of 101 minutes and the very abrupt resolution gives the impression that there was more action and plot before someone ordered it to be cut out.What's left is just an okay movie. It is neither original nor clever and has no spark, no edge, and no bite.

In this film, Woody is kidnapped by an evil toy collector voiced by the-always-evil Wayne Knight (&quot;Seinfeld&quot;). Woody discovers not only his roots, but also the true meaning of family. A lot of people like the yodeling Jessie voiced by Joan Cusack, but I'd have to say that the best scenes involve Tim Allen and his duels with his nemesis Zurg. Pop culture references allow adults to get some jokes that kids might miss, but the kids will have a blast watching this animated adventure. This movie is more plot-oriented than the first--which kids will love--and is hence more fun. Josh Bob says check this out. Four stars.  END",N/A
469676,I went to see this movie and I couldn't believe I wasted $ 4.50 and about 90mins to 2hrs of my time on this movie. I thought it would be great  but I was let down. The movie was so borrring I fought to keep from leaveing the  theater. The movie almost put me to sleep it was that dull. I can't believe  some people actualy liked the movie and for the life of me I don't  understand it. Please I beg of you don't see this movie you will be sorry.,Curse of the Blair Witch VHS

65752,"_Forces of Nature_ is an exploration into the nature of happiness.  It posits the somewhat controversial notion that personal truth can be discovered through infidelity, and that life's answers are to be found in  random acts of nature.  Some may well find these suppositions difficult to  swallow, and may discover nothing redeeming in the ultimate conclusions of  the piece.I, however, found the film charming and plausible.  I very  much like the weather metaphors, and the fact that, for the brief time the  movie charts,  the characters seem to have no power over what's happening  to them.  It is that surrender to the uncontrollable which, in satisfying  irony, ultimately brings stability and genuine change to the characters'  lives.  The director amplifies the meaning of this metaphor through the  clever use of special effects in a way usually reserved to science fiction  films.  It's a very interesting technique to find in a romantic comedy.  Unfortunately, to speak specifically about it would be to give away the  ending,  Suffice it to say that it's a great example of how special effects  can be used to bring emotional impact to a film, not just to create worlds.If there is a fault to the film, it is that the chemistry between  Affleck and Bullock works so very well, that it is emotionally difficult to  understand why Affleck would find his bride-to-be, played by Maura Tierney,  worthy of marriage. It is as if the filmmakers would have us simply believe  that if Tierney and Affleck got to the point of a wedding, the relationship  must necessarily be a strong one.  Of course, we can accept that, but  somehow the strength of that relationship is never quite *shown*.  Without  a demonstration of the Tierney's attractive qualities, some of the film's  conclusions don't make emotional sense to us-even if they're perfectly  sensible.Still, the film is a great date movie, and may well have  special meaning to couples who met in random ways.  Its well-crafted enough  that it could be on some people's `favorite romance' list, and I doubt many  would find it unenjoyable.  It's definitely one of the top 20 romantic  comedies I've seen.(DVD notes: A somewhat bland collection of extra  features is made disappointing by uninteresting deleted scenes and  the  absence of director's commentary.  Luckily, the behind-the-scenes  featurette is worth a gander.)",Forces of Nature

So much anticipation and expectation, to  experience again the wonder of your first time, like being a virgin  again!  It was however not to be.I gave this movie 5 stars because of  what I had originally hoped it would be, but wasnt, I found instead an  appreciating for what it is meant to be, which is a thoroughly enjoyable  tale, a begining of the original Star Wars classic!There are instances  within the movie that people have found disappointing, certain characters  like Jar Jar binks, our young anakin (could you imagine a child less like  Darth Vada! ) and Queen Amidala, or the lack of Darth Maul scenes that had  so whetted our appetites from previews (WHY DID HE HAVE TO ..... SO  SOON! ) and I must admit I aggreed with some of it. But I have discovered  that I can enjoy this movie on a different level, and perhaps it is best  not to have such high expectations but go with the flow of the movie!All  that aside, I feel that you may find in this first installment something  worthwhile. This is our view of the universe before the Empire before Darth  Vada, one whose story I will eagerly be following!

In 1961, Maya  Plisetskaya was considered by many to be the greatest ballerina of her  time; Vladimir Vasiliev (now Gen'l &amp; Artistic Director of the Bolshoi)  was a rising young star of the Bolshoi.

The beginning is great, with the freaky bloodbath dance  club of lowly suckheads.  The best part there is when the kid that was  brought there by some vampire chick drags himself across the blood-soaked  floor to find the impeccable black-swathed form of Blade standing in his  path.  He makes short work of all the vampires in the whole place in a very  cool slaying scene, but unfortunately does not kill the sidekick vampire  Quinn, who wakes up at the hospital and bites the heroine doctor.  It has  many great scenes, and some awesome charcters.  Deacon Frost, played by  Stephen Dorff, is the coolest vampire ever, and in the finale he makes for  a worthy opponent in the great sword fight between good and evil.  The  whole movie is packed with action and vampire history.  I think everyone  should see this movie and enjoy it.

206927,"I did not like this film very much, but I credit it for being the best adaption  of Oscar Wilde's story so far...  This film takes the story and places it in 70's with all of their vices (non-stop sex with coke and  booze,etc.). Dorian Gray is still young and beautiful Enlgish aristocrat  (so that has not changed).  Helmut Berger seems to be the most suitable for  this role, for he WAS VERY BEAUTIFUL, INDEED.  The plot has changed a  little...which  did not spoil the story, either. But, I gave this film 3,  instead of 4 or even 5, because  despite a basically good script, a  wonderful cast, and  a very original idea, this film neither captured the  depth of Wilde's story nor provided viewers with much entertaiment. While  being a very beautiful Dorian Gray, Helmut Berger is also the dullest one,  and that brings the film down. Basically, this film is a well-thought idea  (placing the story in 70's), executed very badly by the filmmakers.",N/A

The 3 central characters are thrown together by fate and each has their own strengths and weaknesses. We see  them suffer through good times and bad and how each responds in their own  unique way. A tremendous study of the human psyche. They don't make movies  like this anymore because how can you even come close to this fine effort!  Today's jaded audience may not even have the patience to sit through this  film because there is no mind blowing special effects, cussing, sex, or  graphic violence. This is a gem from the classic era when films centered  around powerful acting performances playing out a great story line that  made an audience think and follow along. I can't praise this movie highly  enough, see it at any cost.",N/A
502692,"You can either feel envious or pity for Tenchi Masaki. Envious, because Tenchi is surrounded by five beautiful women every hour of every day. Or pity, because most of the trouble that Tenchi faces is usually the result  of one or all of these girls. But then again, if they didn't get up to the  antics that they do, this series wouldn't be as funny as it is. First off,  we have Ryoko, a resurrected demon with a knack for rash and mischevous  behaviour, with a very soft centre for Tenchi, which often results in her  and Ayeka going at it hammer and tong. A juraian princess, Ayeka, who is  prim, proper, and lady like. That is until Ryoko gets her hackles up when  concerning her feelings for Tenchi. Ayeka's younger sister, Sasaami, whose  seems to be the only normal one of the bunch(not if you know her little  secret), who is always in the companionship of a creature that appears to  be a cross between a cat and a rabbit, named Ryo-ohkie. Ryo-Ohkie has a  real taste for carrots(that's an understatement), and can he ever  fly(you'll just have to watch to find out). Next is a ditsy galaxy police  detective named Mihoshi, who would never get a job as an airline pilot. And  last but not least(little actually), Washu, a mad scientist with the most  brains, but just as much eccentricities as the rest.There are other  assorted characters which contribute to the action(such as Kagato and Dr.  Clay) and to the humour(Ayeka and Sasaami's mother in the final episode is  just classic).  Tenchi is just a quiet school kid, whose life would be  pretty boring (as would the show) if they weren't in it. An hilarious, slap  stick adventure series. Highly recommended.",N/A

116625,"When I saw this film some while back, I was pleasantly surprised. I didn't expect nearly what I got. I thought Keanu would be doing the &quot;Bill and Ted&quot; thing, and I expected the plot to be nothing more than two hours of music video montage. I was wrong.Keanu was good. He didn't play a typical role for him. Usually he's either the clear-cut razor-sharp hero or the mushy romantic. In this film he is the reluctant hero, which he played very well. He lost some weight for the role and is quite skinny. Overall I was very pleased with Keanu's performance and I look forward to him coming out with some other good films. Otherwise, the acting was superb from Fishbourne and others.The story is wonderful. It's well thought out, intriguing, timely, original, and is not the least bit porous. It has left me waiting impatiently for the next in the series.This movie broke all paradigms with special effects. They actually invented new technology to meet the needs of filming. You will see things that you have never seen before.The DVD itself is remarkable. There are numerous bonus features contained on the disk, making it a very worthwhile purchase.Lastly, I called this film the &quot;Star Wars&quot; of our generation. I believe this for several reasons. Like &quot;Star Wars&quot;, &quot;The Matrix&quot; wowed us with new technology and a complex storyline that makes you believe that these characters and their world are real. The trilogy aspect is also recognizant of SW, and of course the religious undertones of both films are there if you look. Finally, SW was released when America was excited about space travel and exploration - it was timely. Similarly, &quot;The Matrix&quot; is released during a time of interest in the computer age, specifically artificial intelligence.This is a DVD that you must buy. It will be a classic twenty years from now.",N/A
471047,"I have most of the Buster Keaton DVDs and this is one of the most fun. &quot;Steamboat Bill Jr&quot; is the typical Buster Keaton plot, with twice the stuntwork. The hurricane scene is one of his most famous and shows the  talent, genius and dexterity of this man. Incredibly fun and entertaining  for the whole family.The first short, &quot;Convict 13&quot; is not a  very high quality print, and some parts of it get very hard to decipher,  but you must remember that 1 complete reel of this film was considered lost  forever until recently. At least we get to see the short in it's entirety.  &quot;Convict 13&quot; was one of Keaton's first starring movies for Metro  studios and shows him in a very slapstick-ish role; His trademark dean-pan  expressionism and personality have not quite evolved at the time of this  film. It's still very fun, but not as sophisticated as his later  work.The final short on this DVD &quot;Daydreams&quot;, is another  'nearly lost' classic. The DVD states that some of the footage is  unavailable and they took the liberty to piece a few extra stills and title  cards to make the movie flow with a comprehensible storyline. Once again,  the transfer quality is not high, but better than &quot;Convict 13&quot;.  &quot;Daydreams&quot; is classic Keaton, complete with the chase scene of  20-30 police officers, ala &quot;Cops&quot; (See 'The General' DVD). There  is an implied attempted suicide in &quot;Daydreams&quot;, but it's all  completely off screen.Once again, I have yet to be disappointed by a  Buster Keaton DVD from Kino International.

Gene Tierney stars as a young widow who moves into a haunted house by the sea once owned by dead sea captain Rex Harrison.  Tierney is a stubborn woman and she won't leave, even after a few encounters with the rough seaman.  He quickly falls in love with her beauty and her spirit, and relents in his demands that she should leave.  What develops is an unlikely relationship between the real widow and the unreal captain.  Joseph Mankiewicz wrote and/or directed a lot of smart, mature films in the Forties and Fifties, and this is one of the best of them.  Harrison comes on strong as the captain, and plays the character with much charisma and bravado.  Tierney is as ethereal as ever, and brings out the independence and loneliness of her character very well.  The music and photography add to the mood, and touches of comedy compliment the story.  This romantic ghost story is the kind of movie that even people who don't like romances will end up liking a lot.",N/A

But the talent seems to  run in the family, he is the son of Lawrence Kasdan. Kasdan senior made  'Body Heat', 'The Accidental Tourist' and 'The Big Chill' all great films.  It's basically a very intelligent script filled with sharp dialogue and a  twisting plot brought to life by an extremely likable cast. Bill Pullman  was an odd choice but he makes a compelling Darryl Zero. Pullman has made  some good films in his limited career, namely a small part in 'The Last  Seduction' which is his best performance yet, but is an actor of limited  range. As likable as he may be, one can't help but imagine a more versatile  actor in that crucial role. Ben Stiller on the other hand is perfectly cast  as Steve Arlo, Zero's sidekick and representative. The plot itself has more  twists than a pretzel but it's surprisingly not hard to follow and it's  very involving which heightens the suspense. Ryan O'Neal who will always be  remembered for his role in 'Love Story' makes for a compelling unlikable  character. The basic premise of the script which deals with Zero's  smoothness on the job but social ineptitude in real life is very well  handled until he meats the blackmailer herself (Kim Dickens) and becomes  romantically involved with her. The cornyness of that subplot is what bogs  down the film a little. But still this is one of the most original  mystery-comedies since 'Blood Simple', a much darker and better film of  course but it can be considered a mystery-comedy.

""Drowning Mona"" is a really bad  film that went wrong well before filming ever began. The premise is a good  one, but the script is awful. Bette Midler plays an evil woman hated by  everyone in the small town she lives in, including her own family. After  she meets an untimely demise, the good-hearted sheriff, played by Danny  Devito, must try and figure out who had the best motive to kill her.  This  film is supposed to be a dark comedy, and never delivers on either point.  The bit about everyone in town driving a Yugo gets old about 30 minutes in,  and from there you will find very little to laugh at. Every character in  the film, with the exception of Devito is an absolute idiot, and some of  the jokes about Midlers one armed son are down right offensive.

So, all I will do is give my own ten short and punchy (pun intended) reasons why ""Fight Club"" is a must-see DVD:1) The complex characters. I loved the way viewers can look on the actions of our heroes as maybe a little strange (and even feel outright revulsion as the ""fight club"" concept flowers among their hundreds of followers), yet we can still identify and sympathize with the cultural pressures that drove them to develop their unusual outlet.2) The bizarre, jaw-dropping scenes. Swiping discarded human fat from the dumpsters at the liposuction clinic so that our heroes can make designer soap from it and sell it back to fat-cat women blissfully unaware that they contributed the main ingredient for its manufacture? I was on the floor!3) David Fincher's direction. Never over-directed, never under-directed. Just right.4) The ""Sixth Sense"" style revelation about four-fifths of the way in. It was clever and surprising, and provided yet another reason to watch the film a second time, to catch all the subtle clues planted early on.5)All the extras in the DVD edition. It takes a second disc to fit them all. Nuff said.6) The amazingly funny scenes. Even the throw-away lines had me rolling, like when we learned Tyler was the defendent in a class-action suit filed as a result of the high urine content in the soup he was serving at the hotel restaurant where he worked!7) The crystal-clear DVD transfer. What a picture!8) The great packaging, colorful and eye-catching. And I loved that the booklet with the DVDs proudly included as many negative reviews of the film as positive ones. So subversive!9) The great acting. Edward Norton, Brad Pitt, Helena Bonham Carter, and-- yes!-- Meat Loaf were all perfectly in tune with the material and made us totally believe in them, despite the crazy situations in which they found themselves. And Meat Loaf accomplished that while wearing large female breasts for the duration of the film!10) The closing moments. What vision! We see tender words exchanged in the foreground between two of the major characters (I don't want to give too much away here) while outside the window behind them unfolds the strangest, most apocalyptic vision seen in a movie in recent years. I didn't know whether to laugh or stare in amazement, so I did both.I made the mistake of missing this film during its theatrical run (temporary insanity on my part), but had a ball discovering it on DVD....",N/A
523380,"This is probably one of the best movies I have seen lately. After seeing it, it lets you wondering, full of wishful thinking and wanting for more. Although &quot;Gladiator&quot; is a movie where no expenditure was cut short, the true heart of it is the way it projects the timeless values of the betrayed, incredibly charismatic hero who fights until the end to avenge the death of his loved ones, with a past, unforgotten love lurking around all the time. We get a taste of life in Ancient Rome as well, with its vices and abuses and, above all, its &quot;grandeur&quot;. The animations of Rome are so accurate, one almost regrets having missed it for 1800 years. Russell Crowe in the role of Maximus gives an award winning performance for which he will be remembered forever as the &quot;actor of Gladiator&quot;. He gets deep into the emotions of Maximus, his character, showing us not only his bravery but also - and this is very important - his vulnerability. Moreover he has the gift of a fantastic, deep voice, which adds to the drama of the story and wraps it up spectacularly with a soundtrack that is both glorious at times as well as morose.The scenes are shot with great care and realism. The one with the tigers is fantastic; but I find the one where Maximus' rage has no limits and kills everyone in the arena by himself the most intense.After Russell Crowe's marvel of a performance I second Oliver Reed's and Richard Harris'. Both masters of their task, they also give award winning performances; Reed as the wise ex-gladiator who helps Maximus with his tactics; and Harris as the last Great Roman Emperor Marcus Aurelius. Sadly, Oliver Reed passed away close to the end of the movie and the last scene in which he appears is an animation of his character.I commend everyone in this film, especially the director, Ridley Scott, for giving us the opportunity to enjoy an epic of timeless values in our modern world, so much devoid of them.",Gladiator VHS

202781,"When watching THE WOLF MAN it's just amazing to think that this movie is a mere 70 mins long.  By comparison, PLAN NINE FROM OUTER SPACE runs eight mins longer... and each is a classic, although not for the same reasons.  THE WOLF MAN is a great movie.  Well scripted, acted and performed all  around, there isn't a moment when something is not happening on the  screen... which is good, because there is no time to waste in this movie.  UNIVERSAL has done their usual fantastic job of presenting not only one of  their classic films, but have added the usual bells and whistles to go  along with it.  The best thing I can say about this DVD is the commentary  by Tom Weaver... it's fast, funny, and speaks to the audience on a street  level (which is to say, he dosen't mind sharing the same confusion, humour  and wonder at what is happening both on and off the screen).  For the mere  70 mins of running time Weaver packs it in... by the roll of the closing  credits you know who everyone is... where all the props came from, what was  just PR and what was real, what was cut out, left out, or just left around.

130094,"After Jaws and Close Encounters of the Third Kind, Steven Spielburg cmea back with another huge box-office success in Raiders of the Lost Ark. Harrison Ford is very good as archaeologist Indiana Jones, who goes looking  for the Ark of the Covenant and get it before the Nazis do. The year is  1936. Raiders really never lets you down. It has a frisky pace and great  action. After plundering an idol from a South American tomb, Jones must  escape giant boulders and traps to get out alive, only to give up the idol  to a rival archaeologist outside the tomb. Some other great action is an  exciting car chase through the desert and a big fight in his  ex-girlfriend's bar. The film concludes with horrifying yet spectacular  scene in which the Ark of the Covenant kills the Nazis. Some memorable  scenes are the legendary snake pit scene and where a man with a huge sword  is ready to fight Jones. When the scene was being filmed, the script had a  long fight between the man and Jones, sword against whip. However, Fordwas  feeling ill when the scene was was being filmed, so he asked if it could be  shortened. Spielburg suggested he just pull out his gun and shoot the guy.  The result was a memorable scene. At the Academy Awards Raiders was  nominated for 8 awards including Best Picture, Best Director, Best  Cinematography, and Best Original Score. It won four of them, Best Sound,  Best Visual Effects,  Best Film Editing, Best Art-Set Direction, and a  Special Achievement Award for Sound Effects Editing, making it the most  single Oscared film of the night. Though I like the original Star Wars  better, Raiders is worth many viewings and I suggest you rent or buy it.",N/A

235240,"I first saw DEATHTRAP on television well over ten years ago and it has stuck with me ever since.  I finally purchased the DVD to give it another  go and came away almost as pleased.Caine gives his usual  wonderful performance as a playwright who has run out of hits and Reeve is  better than I've ever seen him, before or since, as an aspiring playwright  seeking Caine's guidance.  Cannon is irritating as Caine's wife, but she's  supposed to be, so I do not feel that her performance weakens the piece at  all.The Plot: Reeve approaches Caine with his first attempt at a  play, seeking his idol's criticism.  Caine finds the play to be incredible,  a surefire hit, and, desperate for such a hit for himself, begins scheming  (as only Michael Caine can scheme) ways to get Reeve out of the picture and  claim the play, DEATHTRAP, as his own.  From this point the picture starts  on a rollercoaster ride that doesn't let up until the end.  Fiction and  reality cross and blur again and again making for a delightfully dark  comedic thriller.My only real criticism of DEATHTRAP is its  similarity to SLEUTH, another great twisted thriller also starring Michael  Caine.  While both films on their own are incredible, fans of SLEUTH may  find DEATHTRAP a bit less satisfying - there simply aren't as many  surprises.  But this is certainly not a reason to avoid this film, as it is  a genuine treasure.The DVD has a minimum of features - no  trailer, just a chapter search selection (which is more than SLEUTH had!)  and, unfortunately, the film is presented full-screen as opposed to  widescreen.  This did not bother me as the entire film has a claustrophobic  feel to it as the action generally occurs in close quarters.  Still, if the  film was originally widescreen, I'd rather see the director's original  vision.  And speaking of direction, Lumet was marvelous as usual.  After  all, in the film itself, DEATHTRAP is described as a play &quot;so good,  even a gifted director couldn't hurt it.&quot;  And at the bargain price  this is one DVD you should snatch up right away.",N/A

The other monsters had their moments, but there was nothing as all-out frightening as Lawrence Talbot's hairy, snarling, fanged late-night alter  ego.  Some decades later, it may not terrify me anymore but it is still fun  to watch.  This movie is brimming with more good points than can be listed;  among them a stellar cast featuring a fantastic performance by Lon Chaney  Jr. (a quality performance which you could tell he cared about; we would  not always see out of Lon in later years) as likable, good humored Larry;  his performance really evokes sympathy as he realizes his cruel fate.  Other fine performances come from Claude Rains as Larry's gruff  conservative father;  the lovely Evelyn Ankers, Ms. '40s Horror Movie  Heroine, as our token love interest (the centerpiece to a love triangle  that actually somewhat holds interest for a change);  and a cameo from Bela  Lugosi as the original werewolf who starts ALL this trouble for poor Larry.  The story and script by legendary Curt Siodmak is well paced and  slick(especially considering the era this film was made in), and there is  an underlying psychological edge to all the werewolfry (it sounds as if the  film was originally intended to be more of a psychological thriller than an  all out monster film). Competently directed by George Waggner, who sets up  scenes that have more flash than substance (but never lacks either one).  A  great moody musical score keeps fresh throughout the entire movie.  WIth  all these good points, in the end probably the best thing this movie has to  offer is that great outdoor set of the gloomy woods;  you know the one,  where it is perpetually midnight, the trees are lifeless and shadowy, and  there is always about a foot of fog over the ground;  in other words, the  perfect setting to which one could imagine that a werewolf might actually  be on the prowl......perfect viewing for late October.",N/A
463558,"Well-intentioned, intially warm and funny film that never quite pulls the two halves of itself together.  The comic fairy tale romance of pre-WWII Italy at the film's beginning, and the (sanitized) nightmare of a father and his young son being held in a Nazi camp in the second half, work like oil and water; though Benigni tries--valiantly--he can't quite pull it off.  (One wonders if the film  might have worked better had the son known the father was faking his desperate cheerfulness, and was going along with the act to indulge him; then, the subtext might have gelled into something stronger and more poignant.)  And the ""happy"" ending will strike a discordant note with many viewers.  Still, it's almost impossible to criticize a  film which so many have clutched to their hearts as a life-altering  experience--you go with it, or you don't, period.  Many adored Begnini's clowning, whereas others found it as subtle and endearing as a jackhammer to the skull. As it stands, ""Life"" is a brave attempt to offer a different perspective on the war, but in no way does it belong in the same breath as contemporary Holocaust milestones such as ""Schindler's List"" ""Bent"" or ""The Pianist""--or even witty, quality fluff like ""Shakespeare in Love,"" which snatched up some of ""Life's"" Oscars (deservedly so).",Life Is Beautiful La Vita E Bella  VHS

Get  Real touches the theme of gay love's challenges in a straight world, where  assumptions are &quot;reality.&quot;  It addresses the tension that exists  between a person with a strong character who is nevertheless bound up by  society's expectations of what is &quot;right.&quot;  Get Real poignantly  addresses the extremes we humans go to in order to conform, but happily, it  also shows us that bravery of spirit and true courage can break away those  shackles that keep us down, and by doing so we gain our independence and  true happiness.

286063,"The Official Companion tells us that this was written for the actress Joanna Frank whom Joseph Stephano had seen and wanted to fashion an episode around, because of her unusual look - with &quot;those strange big-almond kind of eyes&quot;. This look is perfect for her to play a queen bee who has been transformed into human form by her superintelligent hive in order to mate and produce hybrid offspring. Since we are told that the queen bee can produce hundreds of fertilised eggs from one mating, the hive clearly has world domination as their agenda. One might wonder how it is that entomologist Phillip abbott happened to come across the very colony of bees with a plan, as the ones whom he uses with a computer translator to study the language of bees. But then that allows the queen to communicate with the bees and for us to understand the translation. Frank is always seen with her hair over her face, sometimes with only one eye visible, which is suggestive of both her other-worldliness and her sensuality. Director John Brahm gives Frank a wonderfully erotic and gothic close-up with bees in flight superimposed over her face, though the evening gown she is transformed into is odd, particularly the way it provides her with huge falsies. No wonder Abbott is slightly distracted and his wife (Marsha Hunt - who poses like a manniquin) is unnerved. Frank sets her colony onto Hunt to turn the triangle into a couple, but we are told it wasn't the stings that killed her! The Companion tells us that the original draft had Abbott falling in love with Frank, which is the reverse of the filmed version, which would seem a better treatment since as it is, the age difference between them effects the plausibility. And in spite of Conrad Hall giving Abbott twinkly eyes, his entomologist is not a candidate to fall in love with, or to be a stud. The ending too is a worry. The Companion tells us that there were 2 versions and even the one that remains is ambiguous.  This episode is also noteworthy for being made when President Kennedy was assassinated. Perhaps this gives the image of Frank in the deceased Hunt's wedding veil an added irony.",N/A

292912,"Exceptional film virtuoso Sam Raimi (Evil Dead, Army of Darkness, Darkman, and a Simple Plan) dared to rethink his concept on (the Ultimate Exercise in Cinematic Terror) Evil Dead, which had already become a huge cult classic favorite worldwide, by continuing the story of girlish wimp Ashley Williams (Bruce Campbell) after his initial bloody escapade at the infamous log cabin but with a surprising atmospheric twist in presentation.Beginning with a brief recap minus Ash's sister and the other couple from ED 1, Evil Dead 2: Dead by Dawn commences with Ash again becoming prey to all types of Deadite pranks, practical jokes, attempts of bodily possession, unholy possession of his girlfriend Linda, and becoming the butt of all the undead's jokes. Ash is again left to fend for himself against the evil undead denizens sprung from the unholy Necronomicon (Book of Dead) by accident. Unfortunately for Ash, his journey into hell is just starting, and this was just a description of the film's first five minutes. Due to ED 2's unparalleled storytelling zeal and zany sensibilities, it would a criminal offense to give any more away on this goofy classic's plot. Suffice to say it is an indescribable descent into an inconceivable realm where comedy and horror merge into one blissful concoction of hilarity that single-handedly redefined the borders of horror film from then on.Evil Dead 2: Dead By Dawn should be seen all those who enjoy insanely creative movies that push the boundaries of cinema. Even those who think this film may be too violent or disturbing should at least take a brief gander at this. Unlike its predecessor, Evil Dead 2 mixes the sensibilities of a Three Stooges picture with the formula of Evil Dead to conceive an illogical yet supremely entertaining spoof on the horror film.

417766,"I was so disappointed with this - I should declare my interest right from the start - I am a Janeite and I don't like to see people fiddling around with the divine Austen - and that is the main reason why I really don't like this movie. Bearing in mind that other's don't mind things being fiddled around with then I have to say that this movie is exceptionally pretty - the costumes and cinematography are undeniably beautiful. It is also paced well and I have probably thought it quite funny if didn't know that Austen was actually both a lot more subtle and a hell of a lot funnier.Also, try as I might I just can't see Paltrow is right in the lead role of Emma. She is too skinny, and pouty - not at all the vision of Regency beauty depicted in contemporary portraits. Paltrow does do a fine job with the accent being America's favourite faux Brit-girl. But her role isn't helped by they script writers who have messed with book too much in my opinon and thus changed Emma to someone a lot more mean-minded..On the plus side I just loved the two actors who played Mr and Mrs Elton (Juliet Stevenson and Alan Cummings). They have hit the characters off to a T. Mr Weston is also pretty good as is Frank Churchill (played by Ewan McGregor)  - but couldn't they have given him a more convincing haircut?Perhaps it is the nature of the script but I found Mr Woodhouse completely out of character. The subtlety of Austen's portrayal of this character in the novel is completely lost to the script writers. In her book Mr Woodhouse is an ailing invalidish sort with poor understanding - by all acccounts he should fade into the background, yet Austen allows him to dominate many scenes, with his lack of understanding, repeated comments. The ultimate in overwhelming sickness. In this filmed version Mr Woodhouse strides around manfully full of ruddy good health, but little influence - a complete turn around and he lacks the influence he holds in the book over Emma and Mr Knightley.Emma is also changed in character. In the novel the subtelty of how Emma interprets events around her - and how they actually appear is almost lost. In the novel, Emma never completes anything - except the portrait of Harriet - and that is quite important to the plot.The gradual build up in her frustration and that she is led astray by Frank Churchill's lack of social graces is also a necessary plot element in the novel. In this film we see quite a petulant and not particularly nice Emma right from the start - someone who is prepared to gossip meanly to Harriet about the Miss Bateses. I just didn't think a pouty, truculent portrayal of Emma was necessary - nor a rather sulky portrayal of Mr KnightlyAs to Harriet Smith she is supposed to be stunningly beautiful. Not taking anything away from Toni Collette who I do think is very pretty - they didn't do a good job in fitting her out with flattering costumes - or hairstyles, and I don't think she rates as stunningly beautiful at all. Its quite a key point to the book really - and it was something that would have been pretty easy to do.I realise, in the interest of the length of the film it is necessary to cut down scenes, and cut out elements, but very often they completely rewrote lines which altered the scene's meaning completely (Mr Elton's comments on Emma's portrait of Harriet, The first meeting of Frank Churchill and Emma, even the opening wedding scene) All unnecessary. The fact that Austen's perfect words have been read with great enjoyment for hundreds of years leaves me wondering why script writers are so determined to improve them to so little evident result.If you want to see movies where Austen characters are allowed (for the most part) to speak and Look as they should I felt the Colin Firth 'Pride and Prejudice' or Amanda Root's 'Persuasion' were wonderful",Emma VHS
67769,"&quot;American Beauty&quot; is the story of people who've given up their dreams, their very inner selves, for a lifestyle.To a certain extent, my fellow readers, that describes each and every one of us, and that's what makes this film so haunting and effective. There's a little of each of us in these characters.Anyone who lives in a fairly affluent suburban neighborhood knows people like the Annette Bening character, who prunes red roses with matching red shoes and gardening tools, and who is so uptight about her Martha Stewart-wannabe lifestyle that she won't fool around on the couch (God forbid they stain it).And, yes, I see a lot of Lester Burnham (Kevin Spacey) in just about all of my neighbors, and in myself. How often have we wanted to shuck our jobs, smoke dope all day, buy a red 1971 Firebird, and chase cute young thangs? We all have, folks...fess up. The difference is that most of us never act on it; Lester does, and though it's a pure, adolescent prank at first, it eventually becomes something of a trip of self-discovery that leads indirectly to Lester's undoing.It takes guts to do what you want to do, folks, and sometimes you pay the price, which Lester does...with his life. And although Lester reconnects with himself by the end of his life, he never reconnects with his wife (I suspect he doesn't want to), or his daughter, a girl so desperate for meaning and guidance that it's painful to watch.&quot;American Beauty&quot; is hypnotic for a reason - to one extent or another, it shows us OUR lives. How can one not fail to be hypnotized by our lives on the big screen? How can you not wish you had the guts to do what Lester does?Some have criticized this film for its cynical view of suburbia, but I see it as a challenge to move beyond typical concepts of happiness - all of which revolve around money and belongings in our culture - and decide what's really important for you.I find that message uplifting.",Belleza Americana American Beauty  VHS
42160,"This film is really great. It's about three young, cocky Dutch guys whose lives revolve around Motorcross racing and their encounters with a cute, ambitious, smart working-class girl who lives in a trailer and is a short order cook around the Motorcross site.It is ultra-realistic and true to life and at the same time over-the-top and absurd to satirize the equally ridiculous but more fleeting absurdities of everyday life; in fact, 'real life' is much more absurd than anything that happens in this movie, but 'toned down,' and harder to notice, except upon reflection. With 'over the top' movies like &quot;Spetters&quot; the absurdities we all notice (and are often a part of) are turned 'way up high' for instant and easier identification and reflection. Other great movies of this type I've seen are Verhoeven's American version of &quot;Spetters,&quot; &quot;Showgirls,&quot; Sam Fuller's &quot;Shock Corridor,&quot; Ken Russell's fantastic uncut version of &quot;Crimes of Passion,&quot; and Mathew Bright's first &quot;Freeway,&quot; but &quot;Spetters&quot; tops them all. It is the ultimate masterpiece of 'over-the-top' satire.Try to find a well-stocked video store that carries the uncensored, subtitled Director's cut for rent (it's got some very graphic sex scenes in it with full fronal nudity, and a homosexual gang rape that makes anything in &quot;American Me&quot; look tame); it's a well transferred version which came out on HBO video a few years ago, and is now unavailable for sale for some reason; I'd buy it in a second if it was available.",N/A

Five years after Mrs. Voorhees went on her murder spree, a  counselor training center has opened up right across from the now shut-down  Camp Crystal Lake. The new counselors have heard the legend of Jason, but  they don't exactly believe it so he appears and hacks several of them to  death just like his mommy a few years earlier.

308106,"An excellent coming to age comedy with a bit of drama, &quot;Hangin With the Homeboys&quot; chronicles a night in the life of four friends in the  Bronx as they discover that people are often different from what they  appear like.Featuring the talents of John Leguizamo (&quot;To Wong Foo,  Thanks for Everything, Julie Newmar&quot;), Doug E. Doug (&quot;Cool  Runnings&quot;), Mario Joyner (&quot;The Chris Rock Show&quot;) and Nestor  Serrano, the film provided the audience with four fresh characters and  places them in a series of occurrences that make them realize how different  they real are from one another. From Fernando's (Serrano) scam of  impersonating an Italian in order to attract girls (he is Puerto Rican) to  the final scene beneath the Metro North bridge in Manhattan, the  character's all accept change at the end. The most memorable part of this  film has to be when John Leguizamo discovers that the girl he is in love  with is a totally different person, which makes him accept reality and  inspires him to find a way out of the social state he currently is  in.The film is an excellent tribute to anyone who has grown up in New  York City. Director Joseph Vasquez did an excellent job of writing and  producing this small-budget film. Sadly, Vasquez, who at the time was using  heroin, died from complications of AIDS a few years after the film's  release. The film serves as a wonderful legacy for a genius that gave the  world an excellent story with touches of humanism sprinkled throughout.If you liked &quot;American Graffiti&quot; then give this film a chance.

558918,"This highly imaginative science fiction thriller is an entertaining mind bender of a film.  Toby Emmerich's story takes a fresh approach to the time travel angle.  Rather than having people traveling through time, Emmerich has them communicating through time using a Ham Radio that has been augmented by an Aurora Borealis.  Ok, there aren't many Aurora Borealis events as far south as New York City, but there isn't any trans-time communication noted in the scientific literature either, so we need to allow the story a little latitude.After we accept the premise, this ingenious plot incorporates many different elements to entice the viewer.  There is the human angle of a son speaking to his dead father, the many twists resulting from altering the ribbon of time, and the solving of a thirty-year-old serial murder case.  The various elements are combined effectively by director Gregory Hoblit (Primal Fear, Fallen) to produce a fast paced action thriller with sufficient character development to bind us emotionally to the characters.  The fascinating thing about the detective story is that the facts of the crime keep changing in unexpected ways each time John (James Caviezel) imparts something to his father (Dennis Quaid) that causes him to change history.  In addition, the action sequences are well done and the visual effects, especially the digitized Aurora are nicely rendered.  The aging makeup is also realistic.The acting was excellent as well, though the New York accents were pretty bad.  Dennis Quaid alternated between the goofy and endearing dad and the action hero, and managed to keep it from seeming incongruous.  This was a breakout performance by James Caviezel, who heretofore has been confined to minor roles.  His was a very emotional and tense role and he handled it extremely well.  I was also impressed with Elizabeth Mitchell who gave a vivacious performance as John's mother.I enjoy a good intelligent science fiction thriller.  Lately, science fiction has been subsumed into the horror category, since you seldom see a science fiction story that isn't an excuse to hack up some cast members.  This film was more in the tradition of Twilight Zone, relying more on an inventive story than grisly effects to capture the audience.  That's why I rated this film a 9/10.  With luck, this will inspire a return to more creative science fiction.",Frequency (DVD)

I knew that it would be different from the book, but felt that since it was not one of my favorite Austen efforts I would be able to  survive the inaccuracies without exploding with indignation. Happily, my  concerns were unnecessary! I very much enjoyed the film. Fanny, who in the  novel is quite insipid, in the movie very much resembles her creator (Miss  Austen), and, in fact, much of the character's literary endeavors are taken  from Austen's juvenalia. Frances O'Connor does a great job of portraying a  woman who is happier in the background, yet fiercely resists being pushed  into actions that violate her inner values. Another underrated plus for  this film is Jonny Lee Miller's performance as Edmund. He is perfectly  restrained and yet affectionate!

120515,"Some comedies have universal appeal.  This isn't one of them.  That is not to say it isn't funny and entertaining, because it is.  However, it takes a certain sense of humor to enjoy it.  There are two facets to the humor.  The first is the physical comedy of Matthew Perry, which is mostly pratfall  humor.  I enjoy such slapstick if it doesn't go overboard (like when he  bangs his head on the steering wheel; the first time was funny the second  time was overkill) but mostly Perry stays on the funny side of  fatuous.The second facet was situational comedy where everyone was put  in peculiar situations and forced to make decisions about how to behave.  This was the stronger element of the film and though the dialogue was often  weak, the situations were droll and often produced hysterical  results.The directing by Jonathan Lynn was straightforward, giving Perry  wide latitude on shaping his character and much of the comedy.  From what I  understand, Perry was improvising about half the time, which clearly gave  the film a comedic boost.The acting was generally good.  Bruce Willis  plays the straight man as a contract killer with a sense of humor.  Willis  is always understated in his comedy roles, which was perfect considering  Perry's antics.  Mostly Bruce just looked tough and smirked a lot.  Matthew  Perry was full of energy and spontaneity.  He tended to go overboard at  times, but he produced a lot of great sight gags and frenetic humor, which  more than compensated for his excesses.Michael Clarke Duncan once  again makes a tough guy affable.  I always enjoy his work.  Natasha  Henstridge took her role far too seriously, playing it more like a gangland  drama than the comedy it was.  Amanda Peet's main purpose in this film was  to take her top off and create a distraction.  In that regard, she  succeeded nicely.  Rounding out the cast was Rosanna Arquette, whose French  accent was terrible, but she was amusingly nasty in the villain  role.Overall, this was a good comedy for people who enjoy inane low brow  humor.  I am one of those people so I gave it a 7/10.  However, for those  looking for a snappy plot and intelligent dialogue, this film will probably  disappoint.",The Whole Nine Yards VHS

If ever a film was deserving of a remastered DVD transfer this is it - current rumours have an  DVD ETA for end of year 2000.From the rousing opening credits which  features, in my humble opinion, the best movie theme ever written - sorry  Mr. Lucas, but I'm afraid Mr. Williams out-scored himself for this one -  through to it's cliffhanging climax this motion picture has it all. Great  cinematography, superb performances - special mention must go to  Christopher Reeve who played both roles to perfection -, a top notch script  courtesy of Mario 'Godfather' Puzo and confident direction from the, at  times uneven, Richard 'The Omen/Lethal Weapon 1/2/3/4' Donner.

In fact if you  compare the flying sequences from this movie to the subsequent sequels you  will notice a dramatic deterioration from 1st to 4th - this in itself is a  testament to the amount of work put into the original.So there you have  it, whether you are a sceptical first-time viewer, a fan of the whole  Superman mythology or just an ardent movie lover this is one film that more  than holds it's own against today's inferior plagiarists.Sit back and  enjoy.

183418,"'Poltergeist Report' follows a group of young 'spirit investigators' as they become the last hope for the world when the Netherworld threatens to rise and take the place of the mortal world. Sounds pretty neat, I think.  Too bad the execution of 'Poltergeist Report' doesn't live up to its  promise.The film has two fatal flaws, both of which relate to its  script.First, the film assumes *way* too much knowledge on the part of  the viewers, namely that we are familiar with the comic book upon which it  is based. We are never properly introduced to the cast of characters--all  we learn is that they, for some reason, have 'spirit powers' are are in  league with the powers-that-be in the Spirit World. (For most of the film,  I thought they were somehow spirits that were walking the mortal world, but  toward the end, references seem to imply they are mortals.) We also never  learn what their relationships to each other are, and there's never even a  sliver of infomation provided about *why* these kids lead the dangerous  lives they do. The only one that makes a small amount of sense is the  Shrine Maiden, but that's because she's a stock character. Everyone else  remains total enigmas for the entire film, something which I assume is not  the case to anyone who's read the comic book. It would have been nice if  the unitiated could have been granted some insight, too. I suppose that if  that insight had been provided by the film, the title might even make  sense, too. ('Poltergeist Report'? What Poltergeist? What Report?  Huh?)Second, the film probably resembles too much the comic books upon  which it is based in its pacing and execution... which, judgeing by the  film, are probably quite awful. It's a string of fight scenes, with what  passes for the plot serving as an excuse to get from fight scene to fight  scene. And like all bad comic books, the fights seem completely  unmotivated. In fact, on more than one occassion, the heroes behave in a  mystifyingly stupid fashion just so the fight scene can take place. (I  imagine that if I understood why some of the characters behave the way they  do, *maybe* their behavior would make more sense. Somehow, I doubt it,  though.)There isn't much about 'Poltergeist Report' that I can be  positive about. It features average animation and average voice acting (  have the dubbed version). The near complete lack of craft present in the  screenplay, however, more than outweighs the average craftmanship in the  animation and voice acting.I advise taking a pass on this one... unless,  of course, you are a fan of the comic book series upon which it is based.  Then it might well come across as a masterpiece.",Poltergeist Report VHS

466439,"One can't help feeling like a heel for dissing, however slightly, a story about sweet and gutsy mentally challenged people.  However, I came away from &quot;The Other Sister&quot; with the vague feeling the Garry  Marshall, however unintentionally, has exploited the very subjects he means  to elevate, all in the name of popular entertainment.  I applaud the  standout leads, Juliette Lewis and Giovanni Ribisi, who both give  convincing and humanizing performances as Carla and Danny, a pair of  mentally-challenged young people who fall in love.  The bubbly soundtrack  and lovely exterior shots of San Francisco complement the story well.  However, it seems that Marshall is uncertain whether he is making a  uplifting romantic comedy or a treatise on family dysfunction in the 90s.  The movie veers uncomfortably between these two extremes, sometimes with  jarring results.  Because of the subject matter, Marshall seems to feel  that he must present a socially &quot;significant&quot; piece, and throws  in enough family trauma to fuel an entire season of both &quot;Jenny  Jones&quot; AND &quot;Montell&quot;.  I don't deny that a disabled child is  a source of great strain on a family, but the characters Marshall presents  us with are little more than a set of cardboard, ultimately insulting  stereotypes.  Diane Keaton, teetering on the edge of self-parody, plays  Carla's overbearing and high-strung socialite mother, a clothes horse who  cannot come to terms with the fact that her youngest daughter will never be  Deb of the Year.  Tom Skerritt is more sympathetic as Carla's loving but  ineffectual father, a recovering alcoholic who is wracked by guilt over his  daughter and his inability to stand up to his domineering wife.  Throw in  two spoiled and self-involved &quot;normal&quot; sisters, one of whom  further overloads the already over-burdened storyline by insisting that her  family accept her lesbian companion, the disintigrating marriage of Carla's  parents, and Danny's burgeoning alcohol problem and own family troubles,  and you have one colossal stewpot of pain and misery.The film really  shines in its lighter moments. When Carla gets a disasterous makeover at  the mall, or when she and Danny discuss initiating a sexual relationship,  Marshall displays the light touch that made &quot;Pretty Woman&quot; such a  hit.  But too much of &quot;The Other Sister&quot; feels like a failed  attempt at family therapy.  Imagine if Marshall had let us see the dark  side of his hooker heroine Vivian Ward's life in &quot;Pretty  Woman&quot;--beatings by her pimp, nights in the county lockup, visits to  the STD clinic and so on.  You get the idea.  Somewhere in this unfocused  heap of pain, &quot;Other Sister&quot; houses a comedy gem.  It's just  really hard to find.  I'm not suggesting that the plight of people like  Carla and Danny is laughable, far from it.  Just that Marshall tries to  show us too much, and would have done better to err on the side of humor.  All too often, I felt I was watching a glorified TV Movie of the Week,  albeit with outstanding production values.  By the time Carla has her dream  wedding at the end, we are past caring, since it all rings so false and  overwrought.  However, Lewis and Ribisi keep you watching.  Despite all the  Sturm and Drang going on around them, Carla and Danny transcend their  handicaps, and come off as more grounded than the so-called  &quot;normal&quot; people in their lives.  Look for Marshall favorite  Hector Elizondo in a small role as a musician that befriends the beleagered  couple.&quot;The Other Sister&quot; is a pleasant enough video  evening.  Pop plenty of popcorn, so the crunching will distract you from  the story's many implausibilities.

The DVD menus are absolutely outstanding.  They aren't technologically groundbreaking, but they convey the atmosphere  of the movie perfectly.  I was, and still am, extremely impressed with  them.  My only complaint, and it's not really a complaint, is that this is  the Special Edition.  I still have a soft spot for the original... but you  can always jump the colony scene (which I find corny) as it is conveniently  placed in it's own chapter.  Nevertheless, I am happy this movie got such a  great treatment on DVD, and from Fox too, whom had previously given DVD  lackluster support at best.",N/A
71180,"Like so many apocalyptic movies spawned by the demonseed *Omen* in the early seventies, the plot of this poorly written film is discernable once those ubiquitous &quot;occult&quot; symbols appear in the opening sequence.  The movie begins promising enough (and I cannot fail to mention that the  opening menu sequence on the DVD is quite impressive), but quickly delves  into tried territory once we are introduced to an alcoholic Jerico (Arnold  has difficulty playing a suicidal drunk -- you don't get buff on booze,  that's for sure) with a gun to his head.  Having established the character  of the lead in what seems like three mintues, action is introduced in a  very &quot;incidental&quot; way (helicopter chase)--as if to force the  movie into the &quot;action genre.&quot;  Even with the brain turned off to  enjoy the &quot;fun,&quot; bad acting and predictable scenarios (of course  Satan's chosen bride is weak, young, and needing) makes this action movie  fan sleepy.  Essentially, the film attempts to appeal to our own sense of  &quot;evil&quot; as it is related to various insignia and iconography by  simply stringing these items together with little narrative depth (e.g.,  we're shown shots of Satanic symbols scrawled on walls, tongue-less priests  ramble on in mumbo-jumbo before crucified on ceilings, etc.).  THe problem  is that we're so saturated and familiar with this sort of stuff these days  that the ominous connotations don't seem to work as well any more (witness  Polanski's *Ninth Gate*--the film suffers similarly).  Because this film  doesn't develop any sense suspense or attempt to deepen the apocalyptic  narrative, it looks like a collection of urban explosions with a weak  &quot;occult&quot; narrative layered on top.  Hence, this movie is pretty  bad by most standards.  Even action movies lead you up (tease you) to the  explosions.  I like things-blowing-up, but I also like there to be reasons.  If you are content with things-blowing-up just because it's cool, you may  like this.  If you demand a bit more plot/story . . . don't buy this.  Rent  it.",N/A

The lesbian aspect of the film is still a bit of a shocker with she and the ever bonish Mia Farrow rolling in a bed naked or sharing a tub. She overacts outrageously just as she does in her other ccult classic with director Losey, &quot;BOOM!&quot; which John Waters has called the best worst film of all time. It too is a cult camp classic. So Liz is puffy but beautiful and Farrow does her spaced out skeleton number with the most sumptuous interiors ever. Beautifully phtographed but a real  mind twister.

408253,"The Ruling Class remains a unique film in many ways. Totally iconoclastic, brilliantly concieved and executed, original in style and tone from start to finish, it is both hilarious and touching in its story of the 14th Earl  of Gurney (played by Peter O'Toole) who believes himself to be Jesus  Christ. The picture painted of the British upper classes is mercilessly  biased but the comedy that is mined from their shallowness and greed is as  funny as when the film was made. O'Toole's performance is delightful. He  gets to do a little bit of everything in this film, including sing and  dance. The cast of supporting players is brilliant, especially Alister Sim  as a tongue tied Bishop trying to perform a wedding between 'Christ' and  the bride picked for him by his family so they can control his fortune.  Other standouts include such characters as 'The Master in Lunacy', who  decides that the Earl is sane because he has the right school pretensions.  The pivotal twist of the plot comes in the 'healing' sequence when the Earl  is transformed from 'Christ' into 'Jack'. Unfortunately, the Jack in  question is Jack the Ripper. This new persona seems so much more sane, but  violently less so.This is a strange concoction but never fails to  amuse. Everything about it continues to be fresh because nothing about it  has ever been copied. It is a one of a kind film that deserves a place in  any serious video collection of great, original movies.",Ruling Class VHS
21648,"Gosh, this film disagreed with me. Overlong, extremely shallow and with a tone that varies from comical slapstick to brutal fight sequences, watching  this film at that cinema was a mind, heart and buttock-numbing exercise.  Confirming the suspicion that Luc Besson is essentially a grown-up man with  a child's understanding of cinema, it's stylish, inconsistent, and with no  depth of any kind. The film seems like a terrible waste of talent -  Jovovich's edgy, verging-on-madness portrayal of the title character,  whilst never particularly subtle, nonetheless explodes with gusto, and the  battle sequences are highly entertaining in a grim and gritty,  post-'Excalibur' style. The rest of the film is a mess, though. Jeanne's  heavenly visions contain the worst kind of cliched mid-80's pop video  imagery imaginable, not a single line of dialogue stands out (except for  the well-known transcriptions of Jeanne's trial, taken from court records  of the time), and Eric Serra's music sounds rooted in the 1930's, when it  isn't using a 'Fifth Element'-style breathy 'thrum' noise. The tone veers  alarmingly - the opening sequence features Asterix-style comic English  soldiers, pantomime crooked teeth and all, brutally raping and murdering  Jeanne's sister. Later on, Jeanne's expedition to attack Paris is reduced  to a 'Monty Python and the Holy Grail'-style 'attack the castle' fiasco,  whilst the ending tries a stab at indie art, with Dustin Hoffman as  Jeanne's 'conscience'.

STAND BY ME is a glorious look  into the lives of four adolescents who don't leave such glorious lives.  Gordy Lunchance is a kid living in the shadow of his dead brother and  ignored almost completely by his parents; Chris Chambers is an abused kid  with a bad reputation around town; Teddy Duchamp's abusive father is in a  mental institution but Teddy keeps the idea that his father was a terrific  war hero alive; and Vern . . . well, he's a pudgy kid.  What keeps them  going is each other:  their days hanging out in their treehouse, card  games, cursing, normal guy stuff.  They don't have much to do, since the  town they live in (Castle Rock) is pretty boring . . . up until Vern asks  them if they want to see a dead body.  From there, the boys embark on a  little journey to find the body and find out a little bit more about  themselves than they thought they would expect.Is it the music that  makes people feel terribly sad at the end?

The casting, the acting, the script and especially the cinematography, are, I feel, just how one would envision in  reading the book.Some are disappointed that is not that  &quot;scary&quot;, or that it is slow. You may as well level this criticism  against Shirley Jackson's novel. This is not really a horror story as such,  but a subtle psychological tale of an unstable woman, who is seduced and  destroyed by an evil house.

I think if you understand this, you will less likely to be  disappointed. (Having said that, there are some scenes I still would not  watch alone in a dark room!).My only real criticism of the movie, is  that it leaves out some great material in the book that could easily have  been incorporated, and the made the movie a bit fuller. Also I wish the  screenwrtier had not bothered to add so much dialogue that's not in the  book. You can always tell which are the best lines - they are the  author's.As for the new 1999 version, it is nothing but a rip off a  classic book and movie.

474174,"Make no mistake, Stigmata will not challenge your gray matter on any level. Another in a long series of movies apparently put together by music-video directors, Stigmata attempts to cover up its hole-ridden plot with a lot of jump-cuts, cross-fades, and tiresome montages. There are a few interesting visual ideas, but you get the feeling that's the only thing the director brought to the movie, since the screenplay has no real meat. The characters are typically one-dimensional and live only to serve the plot. Many times during the movie, you can see them jump up and walk angrily out of the shot, or deliver a dramatic one-liner and exit (usually to another jump-cut), precisely when the dialogue would force them to say something substantive, or force the screenplay to tip its hand and reveal that there's no real meat to the story. The actors do fine with the roles they're given, but frankly, those roles don't amount to much. Every time this movie comes close to doing something genuine, it hides behind another blaring music-video montage, and ultimately, that's all it has going for it. It gets 2 stars for the mere virtue of being better than the utterly worthless End of Days.",Stigmata VHS

Able support is provided by the underappreciated Christopher Plummer.

The cinematography, music, sound, and direction are all in fact very good.  Shatner shows deft skill at movement and tone in a scene. There are scenes in this film between Shatner, Nimoy and DeForest Kelley that are sublime. Now what's not good... The plot, some of the performances, visual effects and the entire last twenty minutes.The plot is a noble intention; Star Trek crew meets God.  It's problem is it's execution.  In all Trek adventures, Kirk and the crew are the most active participants in the adventure.  Here, they almost stumble upon God.  And that's another problem.  The concept of God can't be adequetly addressed in a Star Trek film.  How can ANY director deal with this subject matter in a tidy 105 minutes while still adhering to demands of Star Trek?Now while Shatner provides good direction, his perfomance here seems rushed and even a little tired.  Kirk looks like he's been up all night studying for mid-terms.  The other performances seem so-so.  Nimoy does a walk through and the other Trek actors look like their trying to steal the scenes from each other.  Perhaps they felt a little competion from Next Generation?The visual effects here are the worst in the entire series.  We all know that ILM lost the effects contract on this movie but there are plenty of effects houses that can offer good effects.  I don't understand how a big franchise film like &quot;Star Trek&quot; couldn't afford another leading effects company.

It is also a sardonic look at the American society and the mechanical agendas we  keep day in and day out, working towards our ultimate goal which is the  immortal sin: materialism. Fight Club not only scoffs at our civilization,  but it forces us to envision a totalitarian society in which we live only  for self-destruction and elimination of order. Pure anarchy and  unadulterated rage. What could be more fun?Even though I'm a woman and  this film literally slanders the female counterpart, I was able to look  past that to see that the story does make a significant and amusing point  in all its glorified madness.&quot;The things you own end up owning  you&quot; is a pitiful but inevitable statement made by the prime minister  of chaos himself, Tyler Durden (Brad Pitt). He explains in so many words  throughout the scattered scenes that we are but mindless consumers drowning  in the money-minded occupancy of our twisted souls, and that in truth we  are nothing more than living, breathing shells all bound by the same  animalistic natures. Soon after the foundation of Fight Club is created, a  nationwide following ensues and Tyler's steadfast minions devise a plan to  annihilate all major credit card companies and all records pertaining,  setting the world's infinite circle of debt back to zero.Following two  steps behind is a soft-spoken victim of society, nameless and  impressionable. He appears to be Tyler's right-hand man and develops his  killer instinct for rebellion and rage. You soon learn that this  &quot;Jack&quot; is the one behind it all, Tyler Durden the resulting  fabrication of his sudden and inexplicable epiphany.The camera work is  creative, flashy and strewn all over the place, the story moving with the  emotional adrenalin of its characters. This could be classified as an  action flick, but it doesn't contain even half the eye-candy car  crash/fire/explosion exhibitions that normal action movies are saturated  in. Fight Club packs the punch with its corrupt ideals and frenzied  motivation, making it a unique classification for the action genre.None  other than David Fincher could have done the movie justice with its dark,  surrealistic mood and spectacular performances from its leading men. He  seems to get the best out of Brad Pitt, whom I, for quite some time,  considered a very mediocre actor and at best just another pretty face.  Edward Norton barely needs guidance here, the perfect picture of the  unassuming and compliant citizen turned masochistic and vengeful mutineer.  As for Helena Bonham Carter, she's an endearing attachment, but more than  anything she's a fifth wheel. The movie could've been done without her and  not much would've changed except for the exaggerated sex scenes, which were  mostly added for humor anyway.If you're looking for a movie that has an  acerbic approach and a wild streak like you've never seen, a movie that  makes you question the way you live and how you think, then head in the  direction of Chuck Palaniuhk's convulted tale.

305525,"Only Angels Have Wings is one of those many hidden treasures, one that was  never really discovered... but will always be remembered.  Taking  place in a South American port of call for local Bananna Boats-Barranca- in  which a Dutchman, John van Rider (The Dutchman) who runs almost everything  in town, owns an air mail service that-despite hazardous and blinding  weather- always sends its mail (and pilots) out on time, so that new planes  can be bought, which will help weather conditions.  As I have  mentioned, the weather is harmful, and many who are emplyed by the Dutchman  are killed at one point or another.  Out of the small gang of pilots  (including John Carrol as Jent Shelton, in a minor but excellent role), one  stands out; Cary Grant, who plays Jeff Carter, a once sensitive and caring  man who was turned into a cynical, unhappy chappy after a harsh breakup.  Running the airline, Jeff only goes out when he thinks it might be too hard  for anyone else.  Bonnie Lee (Jean Arthur, in one of her first large  roles)has just gotten of a Northbound boat to cool off for a couple of  hours before the ship has loaded some bannanas and is ready  to set out to  sea. On the shore, she is met by two pilots who (after some trouble) manage  to &quot;get&quot; her.  Heartless Jeff sends one out for a  delivery, contrary to a deal made between the two. Bonnie is shocked by  Jeff's behavior. After deciding to come back when the fog is too much to  bare, the pilot attepts a dangerous landing resulting in his death.  Bonnie is shocked by how easily and rudely the bunch takes it. However,  she is explained to by two members of the band, including Jeff's veteran  flier best friend Kidd (played by Thomas Mitchell in perhaps one of his  best roles) that they must do that or te feelings balled up inside them  would be too much to bare. So Bonnie cheers up and joins the group.  The next day, when Jeff gtes back from a delivery, he is surprised to find  that Bonnie purposely missed her boat ride. He informs her in a rather  cruel manner that she has to go on the next boat.  Just when  everything seems perfect, a new pilot, McPherson (a great role for Richard  Bartelmess) and his wife Judy arrive, (Rita Hayworth, in her career  starting film) and two rather astonsihing revalations are made.  After, the pilots try again to lead a happy life, though, as they discover,  it may be rather difficult.ONLY ANGELS HAVE WINGS is perhaps  one of the ten best films to this day, although widely ignored. The  performances, direction, and sharp dialougue are equivalent to a solid five  of today's so-called best films.  Cary Grant is amazing, and as  always, was ignored by the Acadamey Awards, as was everything about the  film.Even among other films such as Gone With the Wind, The Wizard of  Oz, Gunga Din, Mr. Smith Goes to Washington, and other outstanding films,  Only Angels Have Wings is this viewers favourite.

326996,"OK, I will come clean at the very beginning. In 1984 I was not enamored with Colin Baker as Doctor Who. But before all you sixth Doctor fans click that you find this review unhelpful, let me assure you all that in recent  years I have warmed to him and appreciate his portrayal much more. But that  does not alter the fact that his debut story is an absolute travesty.  &quot;The Twin Dilemma&quot; is a shockingly bad production, with  disgusting giant slugs, dreadful costumes (although the Doctor's character  justifies his atrocious get-up), irritating music and awful acting  (especially from the twins Romulus and Remus, who could go down as the most  annoying characters in the show's history). The character of the newly  regenerated Doctor is also questionable. True, Colin Baker's Doctor is  irascible and arrogant, geared to make him more of an anti-hero, but  attempting to strangle Peri goes beyond the bounds of what should be  acceptable in Doctor Who. Even William Hartnell's Doctor, who was the  ultimate anti-hero (placing his companions' lives in danger so he could  satisfy his curiosity), was never as violent. The strangling scene is an  indication of the downward spiral into bad taste and unpleasantness that  John Nathan-Turner saw fit to inflict upon the series. But I digress.  &quot;The Twin Dilemma&quot; has no redeeming features. It has all the  hallmarks of a story that should never have been made. It is hardly a tale  that should introduce a new Doctor.

482059,"I am a great fan of Jane Austen's and I have enjoyed reading many of her  works, although I had never heard of this one before seeing this film.  Those who profess to be experts about such things say that this early work  was not one of her best.  However, I found the film to be delightful and  very much in keeping with Austen's penchant for conjuring up romantic  intrigue in 19th century English society.This is the story of Fanny  Price (Frances O'Connor), who is taken out of poverty by her aunt and  benefactress to live in high society.  Though she is given every benefit  afforded her cousins, she is constantly reminded of her second-class status  in the household.  As the story revs up, we are treated to a typical Austen  maelstrom of misplaced romantic affections.  Mariah Bertram (Victoria  Hamilton) is engaged to Mr. Rushworth (Hugh Bonneville), but she is  infatuated with Henry Crawford (Allesandro Nivola) as is her sister Julia.  Though Henry enjoys flirting with Mariah, his true affections lie with  Fanny.  Fanny shuns his attentions because she loves her cousin Edmund  (Jonny Lee Miller) who is smitten by Henry's sister Mary (Embeth Davitz).  This is a classically delicious Austenian romantic conundrum.  The  remainder of the story goes about reconciling all the unrequited love with  more than a few interesting twists.Patricia Rozema adapted and directed  this film, which was very nicely done.  The choice of locations was  excellent and she used the countryside effectively, giving us numerous  lovely outdoor scenes.  The period rendering was very good as well,  presenting very realistic 19th century sets and costumes.  There has been a  lot of controversy about Rozema's insertion of the slave issue, which was  notably absent from Austen's novel.  To a point, I have to defend Rozema,  but ultimately I felt she went too far.A director has a responsibility  to make the film believable by providing details not in the script.  For  instance, Austen doesn't specifically describe the actual dress and  furniture of the time, so the director must find suitable props and  costumes of the period to give the film a genuine look and feel.  Slavery  was a dominant issue of the time and so the insertion of the topic was a  realistic detail, as long as it remained in the background.  However, the  introduction of the sketch pad (those who have seen the film will  understand) took slavery out of the background and made it a plot element.  This was tantamount to rewriting Austen's story, and I felt it was a  preachy and presumptuous abuse of artistic license.Frances O'Connor was  outstanding as Fanny.  She was enchanting and effervescent and passed  credibly for a teenager despite being almost 30 years old.  Fanny was a  multifaceted character.  She was a combination of youthful ebullience,  fierce independence and stubborn determination.  O'Connor handled all these  aspects of her character like a pro.  Embeth Davitz was also excellent as  Henry's conniving sister.This delightful and well-crafted film is very  entertaining and enjoyable.  I rated it 9/10.  With the possible exception  of the slavery issue, lovers of Jane Austen will not be disappointed.",Mansfield Park VHS

20755,"I HATE untidy or ambiguous endings.  Check that...I LOATHE untidy or ambiguous endings.  Whenever I see an untidy/ambiguous ending, I think that either: 1) the writer/director didn't know how to end the movie, so figured  he'd just stop filming somewhere along the way; or 2) that the  writer/director is going for some deep meaningful ending that is supposed  to make us think he/she is a &quot;powerful&quot; director willing to  &quot;take risks&quot; to &quot;make a statement&quot;.Well, let's just  say that I found the ending to Limbo to be one of the most satisfyingly  ambiguous endings I've ever seen.

I wasn't all that looking forward to watching it, but when I finally did, I thought it was wonderful. The casting is  terrific, the singing is heavenly, the costumes and sets are gorgeous, the  chereography could NOT have been better and the script itself was amusing.  Brandy makes a really good Cinderella, although she is not the star of the  show by far. Whoopi Goldberg was a really amusing Queen, and Victor Garber  made a terrific King. Whitney Huston was a really cool Fairy God Mother,  but she certainly didn't steal the show, as much as she thought she would.  The step sisters were hillarious too. But Bernadette Peters as the Step  Mother and Paolo M. as the Prince are the ones who stole the show. Paolo  has such a gorgeous singing voice and extremely good looks. He IS as  charming as a prince could EVER be. I thought the songs were splendid, and  I really liked 'Falling in Love with Love' which was an addition, sung by  the step mother and the step sisters. I don't much care for the finale  'There's Music In You', which was written just because Whitney Huston  wanted to do a solo. The Stepsisters Lament is superb, and 'Do I Love You  Because Your Beautiful' is so romantic.  Overrall, this movie has  everything a family entertainment film needs : romance, enchantment,  humour, a good pace and a terrific score too.

Next to the Grinch trying to steal Christmas, this is the most uproarious  funny send up of Christmas I've ever seen, yet after watching it you still  feel good and miraculously it extends the good cheer. Leary plays a master  thief, who robs and then takes hostages, Kevin Spacey and Judy Davis, and  if he knew what trouble they would be, he would have run faster from them  than the police. These two yuppies take arguments to high art, with Leary  only barely having control because he has a gun, but that does not stop  their tirades. Add to this wild mix is the family coming over for dinner,  gourmet-cooked by Judy Davis, and they hate it. The great Glinnis Johns, as  Kevin Spacey's mother, is wonderful, as is all the supporting cast. Only a  super-animated character like Leary can keep up with this wildly funny,  fuming couple and try(barely) to sort things out. From start to finish, the  film rocks with verbal velocity, sight gags(the Swedish candle headpieces  were my favorite, with mother saying &quot;my head is getting hot,&quot;)  and a drunken neighborhood Santa turning quite Scrooge-like and whacky when  inebriated. The laughs never stop but like most movies there is a short  time to try to stop all this nonsense, draw some moral conclusions(after  all this is a Christmas movie-kind of) and find an ending. The ending isn't  very clear, for we have seen and heard so much. It would be difficult to  draw just one conclusion. Suffice it to say that The Ref is the funiest  movie I've watched in years.

409200,"""Giant"" This film is a masterpiece. I have always been an admirer of James  Dean. This film let's us see him come full circle from a youthful rascally  critter to an old man stubborn to the end clutching to some unrealized and  unshared dream of acceptance by his fellow man. As Jett Rink, Dean knew  exactly his own feelings in regard to the social economic classes that  society had conveniently categorized individuals, especially those germane  to Texas. He feels no guilt toward his own prejudices and only strives to  be accepted by the upper class (his fellow man) from which he literally  rose up to from the ground and enters into its ranks. Rock Hudson's Bick  Benedict, from his perspective, was born into the upper class and sees  himself as a great benefactor to the lower classes that are employed by  him. Unlike Dean's character, he is unaware of his own prejudices. The  Elizabeth Taylor character, Leslie Benedict, stands away from the canvas  and represents the unprejudiced point of view of the unflawed human spirit.  She stands as a mirror to reflect back the personifications that both Dean  and Hudson exhibit. She is direct and to the point with Hudson, her husband  in the film. He is just too blinded by his own upbringing to even make some  sense of what she is trying to point out in his flawed but self-noble  character. With Dean she is subtle in her assessment of his human  qualities, just as subtle as he is in the revelation of his prejudices.  Hudson does finally confront his flawed character very nobly and very  unaware of his own motivations. Dean does come full circle and ends up  where he started - still a scoundrel, but old and used up. I think that the  Hudson and Dean characters were a reflection of Texas society from both  ends of the spectrum set in the mid-twentieth century. As noble as the  Hudson character was in his attempt at redemption, Texas was not ready for  change at that time in History, but the seeds were planted (also  represented by Hudson and Taylor's offspring in the film) and it was just a  matter of time. I was born and raised in New England, but visited Texas  many times where half of my family resides. I have seen Texas first hand  from the early 60's to the present. This film has a special meaning for me.  The characters and the performances ring true. George Stevens' attention to  detail is seen and heard in every frame of this film. The performances of  its three stars are flawless, as are those of its many supporting players.  The Dimitri Tiomkin score is a great asset to the feel of this film. He  thematically represents the characters and their backgrounds to  dramatically drive the narrative. One scene that made you want to stand up  and cheer was the fight in the roadside diner. This scene was just as  moving and exciting as the bar room brawl in George Stevens' ""Shane"" and it  has his directorial fingerprint all over it. I highly recommend that people  get a chance to see this film and place themselves in the not too distant  past and view it from the perspective of when its characters lived and  thrived. This VHS widescreen version is excellent within the constraints of  the format. I was very pleased with it and it is the best version that  Warner Brothers has put on VHS in my opinion. I was also very much pleased  with the supplemental material included.",Giant Special VHS
552545,"This highly recommended June 28, 1985 Montreal concert--previously issued in Japan--helps reopen the case for recognizing much of the music of Miles' final years as a reiteration of his trademark strengths, albeit perhaps  without a stunning creative landmark on the order of KIND OF BLUE or  BITCHES BREW.  Maybe LIVE IN MONTREAL is that mid-80's signpost--if not,  it's very close! The level of inspiration, commitment to excellence, and  turning the future into the present is what you would expect of Miles at  any point in his career!Davis' acumen for picking talented,  individualistic sidepersons is glaringly evident on this Montreal date.  John Scofield is of course a premier electric guitarist who makes very  distinctive contributions, while reedman Bob Berg is a similiarly inspired  soloist.  Synthman Robert Irving III is the playmaker who doesn't shoot the  ball much (i.e., no solos) but dishes out assist after assist to the  overall group sound, via subtle textures that sometimes achieve the spirit  if not the letter of the orchestrated Gil Evans sound that Miles seemed to  desire after 1983.  Darryl Jones puts those ping-ponging, thumb-popping  notes in just a little bit better place than most other bassists.  Vincent  Wilburn Jr. provides a full sound and solid beats, thankfully without  forgetting that his is a supporting role, and percussionist Steve Thornton  also plays what is needed, where it is needed.Included are expansive  versions of the two most notable ballads of this era (HUMAN NATURE, TIME  AFTER TIME), while the funk/r&amp;b/soul idiom is covered via D-Train's  SOMETHING'S ON YOUR MIND.  Don't be concerned if you're not a fan of the  then-current YOU'RE UNDER ARREST or DECOY albums which provded the bulk of  the material for this tour: they were merely blueprints for the passionate  live renditions heard here.By TIME AFTER TIME, CODE M.D., and a  Spain-sketched reworking of JEAN PIERRE, Miles Davis' playing is in a ZONE,  absolutely burning with a passion he rarely surpassed--before or after!  Davis' solos are marked by extended length, great endurance, and confidence  in all ranges of his horn.

However, after reading Loung ung's chilling memoir &quot;First they killed my father&quot; I thought I would give this video another  try.If Dith pran's experience was one tenth as bad as ung's (and I am  sure it was ) This movie failed terribly in portraying that. In fact if  your not wacthing the dates on the bottom of the screen you might be  forgiving for thinking Dith Pran was only in the fields for four months as  opposed to the nearly four years he actualy spent there.The documantery  style also was a problem in that it has little room for emotionaly  connecting with the main charecters, Dith Pran and Sidney Schanberg.  Schanberg's blame America first attitude also wore thin Quickly, yes  America's bombing of Cambodia was wrong headed and yes we should have done  more sooner to prevent the atrocities from happening but blaming America  for Pol Pot wipping out nearly half of Cambodia's population in four years  is a bit like blaming Britian for the holocaust becase of it's policy of  appeasement in the late 1930's.As for the ending with Dith Pran and  Schanberg being reunited to the tune of John lenon's Imagine I found this  more insulting then tearfully happy.

52992,"This new Collector's Edition of CONAN is a joy; I give it five stars for a film of its type (heroic fantasy); those not in the mood for such fare will rate it lower, but director Milius and his crew have captured to a T the spirit of the Conan books and the requirements of large-scale Sword &amp; Sorcery adventure.The score alone is majestic, and John Milius is the best action director since Kurosawa (one of his role models).  This film  BREATHES its mythic, savage ethos.  Because Milius is such a  believer (the alternate audio track featuring Milius and Arnold is both hilarious and revealing of the careful thought that went into this production), the film always rings true.  It is not a product of some paint-by-numbers Hollywood hack going through the motions.  The script is amazingly free of excess verbosity -- the lead character doesn't even say a word until 25 minutes into the film!  (How many other films can get away with that?)  Yet it is all done so gracefully and organically that the effect is completely natural. Milius is not a man to clutter a scene or shot with dialogue  when the camera work or an actor's expression are sufficient.  The stunningly choreographed battles are fluid, dramatic, and ballet-like in their grace (Sandahl Bergman is particularly impressive as Conan's Xena-esque companion), not clumsy hackfests as they might have been in lesser hands.  There might have been more wizardry (this isn't one of Milius' real interests, as demonstrated by the subpar giant snake effects), but the action and pacing are impeccable and the overall effect is very genuine -- this film WILL take you back to a legendary, alien time.  This is as good as Sword &amp; Sorcery gets on film, and shines all the brighter when held next to the woefully inferior sequel (Conan the Destroyer) or spinoffs (Red Sonja)One technical complaint I have is that the theatrical trailers mentioned on the package don't really seem to be on this disk, and the soundtrack seems to be in less-than-full stereo -- otherwise, the digital transfer is impressive, with restored footage and an illuminating commentary track.  The &quot;Making Of&quot; featurette is also a cut above the norm.",N/A
209129,"&quot;The Wrath of Khan&quot;, which was made for a fraction of what its' predecessor (&quot;The Motion Picture&quot;) cost, is a far better film in every respect.

His over-the-top  turn as the genetically-enhanced, Melville-quoting, super-intelligent,  certifiably loony Khan is terrific - so good, in fact, that Khan remains a  touchstone sci-fi villain to this day.The film does have flaws. While  the &quot;exterior&quot; special effects are outstanding, some of the  interior sets are incredibly cheesy - particularly the &quot;chamber&quot;  where Spock dies, which features multi-colored disco lights in the ceiling  and floor.

The training scenes at the Shaolin temple in the 35 Chambers are amazing.  Liu truly does a fantastic job.  However, the final fight between Liu and the Manchu general is rather short especially the ending.  The transfer is not good but you can deal with it.

75245,"I can't decide whether or not Dolph did not apply himself to this role in the slightest and ended up turning in a monotone performance or because the character is supposed to be dull and depressed. Either way it's slightly depressing to watch. The plot concerns Frank Castle AKA The Punisher and his effort to rid Washington DC (actually Melbourne, Australia) of criminal scum. He's wiped out a million guys in a couple of years and the cops want to send him to prison. Frank Castle used to be a cop and since the Mob killed his family he's lived in the sewer. As you do...This film has been cut to shreds. I know there was more story and action filmed than what was actually shown in the film. It's criminally short but seems to go on for an eternity.The director is Mark Goldblatt. He edited ""Total Recall"", ""Starship Troopers"" and ""Hollow Man"". The action is quite dull and Dolph has no one-liners and no emotion. Dolph can usually be relied upon to deliver the goods but not here. I guess in 1989 he couldn't pick and choose his roles. This film followed the abysmal ""Red Scorpion"", his clout wasn't as such so he could so ""no"".Dolph has enjoyed some decent roles but in recent years he has been offered some really bad scripts. I think it's time he realized he should be getting back into A-List films. This is not his best.

Pierce Brosnan has done an incredible job in the role and &quot;The World Is Not Enough&quot;  is probably his best Bond film to date.

In this film Bond  is sent to protect Electra King, the daughter of a wealthy businessman from  a probably his most dangerous villian to date.

524152,"She get's 20 million dollars a picture. Does she deserve it? Yep. This movie is great.Julia was superb in the movie - no question about it. She's always great - but this isn't the sweet role she usually plays. I think I heard someone compare her performance to Sally Field in Norma Rae, and I'd second that. She, as Field often does, nails the hard, rough exterior that holds back a tender, caring inside. Roberts is truly excellent in this movie - funny, quick, strong... just brilliant. Albert Finney is excellent as her 'sidekick' in this one - watching them together is truly a joy. You can see in their eyes they're enjoying their jobs, and I swear there were a few times when I caught Finney laughing, almost shocked about Roberts' performance. Regardless, it was an incredible duo. This kind of age difference is hard to accomplish, (see Catherine Zeta-Jones and Sean Connery in Entrapment) - but this one works well.The script is also great - although there are many points when you can feel the fact the writers were trying to squeeze too much in. But - it does it well. John Travolta starred in A Civil Action, a very similar movie, but one which I was ready to leave after a half an hour - Brockovich, despite running about the same time, seems to go by much quicker.Overall - you gotta see this movie.

440263,"This is a superb film in every way. George C. Scott did more than act. He was Patton! Right down to the look, mannerisms and speech. This movie was drawn from the book by Ladislas Farago and is pretty accurate given the  timeframe of the movie. Patton was one of the most brilliant, eccentric,  and egotistical generals ever. He was a pure warrior and didn't seem to fit  in with the politcal aspects and complexities of the Allied alliance. A  devout historian, he was noted for using the same strategies used by past  military greats. The soldier slapping incident was a real tragedy in the  sense that how many more lives could've been saved had the Allies not  sidelined their best general and allowed him to run rampant to bring the  war to a quick end. Karl Malden does an excellent job as Omar Bradley and  is a fine compliment to Scott's Patton. This is one of the greatest movies  ever made, five stars does not do it justice.",N/A

His father is cold and unloving and the family constantly recalls  the dead young man that could do no wrong, while neglecting the son that  they have in their midsts... preventing Gordie from being able to mourn the  brother he looked up to and misses dearly.A group of local teenage thugs  with names like &quot;Ace&quot; (Kiefer Sutherland) and &quot;Eyeball&quot;  are switch-blade wielding punks who happen upon the body of a mentally  challenged boy who has been missing for a few days.  As they make plans to  return to the site to recover the body for a reward, Eyeball's younger  brother (the late River Phoenix) and friend of Gordie's overhears the  details.Gordie and 3 of his closest pals embark on an adventure to  recover the body before the thugs do and have experiences that change their  lives in the process.  The story is far less about the body, and far more  about the relationships the boys have with their fathers and each  other.They camp out in the middle of woods during their adventure and  tell stories and share their hearts with one another. Sometimes tender,  sometimes drop dead funny, the story will give you a glimpse into the  tender side of boys they rarely feel comfortable in sharing in our culture.  Deep, caring guys who have been supressing their self-doubts, fears and  anger and sometimes manifesting the emotions in humor, delinquent behavior  or just overeating.The acting is superb and you feel less like you're  watching a film and more like you're one of these guys, joining them on  their adventure.It's amazing to see the chubby little Jerry O'Connell  who grew up to be the buff chick-magnet on &quot;Sliders&quot; and  bittersweet to see the late River Phoenix in his screen debut at a time in  his life when there were no drinking binges or illicit drugs.The film  is rich, tender and bittersweet.

However, I distinctly remember laughing out loud at how stupid the plot was and how unrealistic some scenes were.  Samuel Jackson could have been great in this film if the script had been there (that is why I went to see it in the first place).  Unfortunately, the script is WRETCHED.  They could have come up with a more realistic and believable crime at the start of the movie to set the wheels of injustice rolling.  Do people really bludgeon other people to death on the street right outside a crowded bar because they are dissed in front of their friends?  When the first shooting/car chase takes place, you have to suspend your belief because it seems ridiculous.  The gangsters seem fake, and the relationship between Bale and the drug dealer rings as false as the &quot;count every vote&quot; mantra of good old Al G.

397201,"I used to be annoyed with Woody Allen, but I think you just need to watch more than just a couple of his films. I had wanted to see this film for a long time. It was much different than I ever thought it would be. Very different, very funny and very well acted.Of course Woody Allen is Woody Allen, which I've come to expect in ALL of his films. Allen and his wife, played by Helena Bonham Carter are thinking about adopting a baby. Of course Allen doesn't want to. So...they do. After years of having this child, they are great parents and are living a good life. But when Allen starts to become obsessed about finding out who his son's real mother is, it takes him to the edge. That's where he meets a quirky prostitute, who goes by the name of Judy Cum (played wonderfully by Mira Sorvino). This is his son's mother. He wants to change her life, make her life a better one so when, and if his son ever finds out this is his mother he won't be ashamed. As Allen and Carter's relationship grows apart, a romance begins with Sorvino and of course Woody Allen tragic comedy insues.The film is built around a Greek play that is happening. These players in the Greek play are advisors to Allen's life. They help him make choices and give him advice, which he rarely takes. It was a very nice, original and unique spin which made the movie that much better. All in all it's a pretty much relaxed, semi-funny, comedy-drama about second changes, marital issues, children, and living up to your dreams. Wonderful piece of film here.",Mighty Aphrodite VHS

510835,"Back on September 8, 1966, television was forever changed when the first broadcast episode of Star Trek hit the air waves.  No one at that time knew that the series would endure for over thirty years, building up a strong,  loyal fan base that would serve as the spring board for three new series  and a string of successful films.Looking back, it's interesting to  think that Trek started with the rather so-so episode, &quot;The Man  Trap.&quot;  It's the story of McCoy's old love who happens to turn out be  a salt vampire.  Along the way, we meet several members of the crew and get  exposed to what could be described as a day in the life of the starship  Enterprise.  We also get a snippet of time with all the major players who  inhabit the first 12 episodes of the original series.On the far more  enjoyable side is the classic episode (that Next Generation blatantly  ripped off in only their second episode) &quot;The Naked Time.&quot;  The  crew is infected by a virus that makes them act  as if drunk and brings to  the surface emotions and characteristics the crew usually leaves buried.  In addition, the ship is spiralling down toward a dying planet and is  forced to race against time.  &quot;The Naked Time&quot; has it all from  character development and moments to a taut, danger ridden plotline to some  super music by the master of Trek music, Alexander Courage.  It's simply a  masterpiece of Star Trek and one that deserves another look.  It also  features what many consider some of the best acting of the original  series--namely in the conflict between Kirk and Spock in the briefing room.  And really, it's hard to argue...My only major complaint with the DVD  (and thus what keeps it from five stars) is that Paramount decided to  package the episode as the special edition which was shown on the Sci-Fi  channel.  Paramount decided to mess with the original credits for the  first couple of episodes until fan outcry forced them to restore the  original version we know and love.  However, instead of spending the time  to replace the credit, Paramount used the Special Edition opening for  &quot;The Man Trap.&quot;  I know it's nitpicky, but this small  &quot;correction&quot; mars an otherwise flawless DVD and takes a bit away  from the viewing experience.",N/A

Big Daddy IS a bit cliched (immature guy wants to  prove to his girlfriend that he is responsible, so he manages to trick  social services into allowing him to adopt a five year old boy.

519589,"This movie changed the way I look at life.  We all take so much for granted and it could all end at any moment.  This is one of the main ideas  of Jesus' Son.  The main character, FH, stumbles through life while many of  his friends die, yet he remains unharmed and only gradually begins to  change his ways.  This movie may be about death and pain, but it is  optimistic and hopeful; as long as life continues, something good can  happen.  There is a surprising amount of humor in the film, all of it  compassionate, it doesn't result to mocking the characters or the  situations as so many movies these days do.Some people have complained  that Jesus' Son imitates Pulp Fiction in its narrative.  This is untrue -  the story unfolds as FH tells it, sometimes he doubles back to give more  detail or fill in gaps, but for the most part it is linear.  FH's narration  gives the movie much of its personality.The acting is astoundingly  realistic throughout.  Of all the movies I've seen this year, Billy  Crudup's performance is the best.  Hopefully he will soon achieve the  widespread recognition he deserves.  The entire cast performs admirably,  every actor gets at least one scene to shine, with Crudup providing the  link from one to the next.  My favorite scene was Dennis Hopper's - his  final line speaks volumes about life and death and the human condition.The direction is self assured and impressive.  There is not much self  conscious camera trickery, and when it is used, it is to good effect.  The  soundtrack is another stong point, all of the songs enhance the mood of the  scene perfectly.Jesus' Son reminds me of last year's Bringing Out the  Dead in the way it subtly reveals so much about the nature of redemption  and the beauty that can be found in life if you just allow yourself to see  it.

562208,"For the uninitiated, &quot;Secret Garden&quot; is the fantastic duo of Rolf Lovland, (composer, keyboards), and Fionnuala Sherry (violin). He's Norwegian, she's Irish, and together, they have created some of the most remarkably heartfelt and melodic music of recent years.  Combining elements of celtic, classical, new age, and pop, this is music for the romantic visionary.  That said, let it be known that this DVD is an extraordinary look at the group, on and off stage.  In addition to the hour and a half concert, (which I believe is 30 minutes longer than the VHS version of the same show), you also get 2 different thirty-minute documentaries, a complete discography with brief audio samples of every track on the albums, 2 music videos, biographies, photo gallery, an optional running narrative for the concert, and a really cool 3-D animated intro before any of the above comes on the screen.  The concert itself is nothing short of phenomenal.  If you are a fan of their albums, rest assured that nothing is lost in the transition of these songs to a &quot;live&quot; setting. (Yes, the original CDs made use of a full orchestra, but the smaller one used in the concert is equally effective. Choral group, &quot;Anuna&quot;, makes an appearance, as well.)  I love to see an artist become totally &quot;lost in the moment&quot; during a performance, and that's what you are treated to, here.  It's obvious that Rolf and Fionnuala love what they do.  With a complete concert, and so many &quot;extras&quot; included, this is truly a bargain.  I can't recommend it highly enough.

Furthernore, the triple separation - between dream, Mima's first role in the television thriller &quot;Double Bind,&quot; and the real-world events of Mima's life surrounding her shift to an acting career - is so fuzzy that the spectator becomes just as confused as Mima, which is itself a superb and refreshing facet of the film.Those who do now know Japanese are are not habituated to watching films with subtitles should see the dubbed version first, as the necessity of literally &quot;reading&quot; a film would detract from the overall experience due to the spectator's wavering attention between the subtitles and the almost non-stop on-screen action. Perfect Blue is, in my opinion, a perfect film (except that the characters - all Japanese - appear to be &quot;white&quot;) - or as close to perfection as is possible in animation.However, MINORS SHOULD NOT SEE THIS FILM due to some highly adult scenes.

439891,This movie only lasts for barely 89 minutes. This makes me wonder if anything was cut out of the movie in the editing room. I think there was when I watch the film. It could have been so much more. What's left is a very brief and entertaining movie about a prison break. With very little Firestorm.Many people have said that Howie Long's performance in this film is quite poor. I think that he did a fine job. I can honestly say his performance is totally adequate. William Forsythe is quite a decent villain too. Neither hammy nor campy. I'm glad he was in the movie.But I'm not glad the film was a flop. It would have been a big hit if it was longer and had more plot. You can't call a film FIRESTORM and have only a few seconds worth of fire in it. I don't know what has been cut from this film but it has damaged it severely. Chris Soth is the only person credited with writing this film but rumor has it that Graeme Yost actually wrote the first draft but used his affiliation with the of the WGA to take if off after they hashed his script around too much.Although it is bare-boned and anorexic it is still a cool film to watch.It really would benefit from a Blu Ray release though.,Firestorm VHS
131511,"Okay, this is my second attempt to comment on this movie. So here goes. This movie really captures the true talent of Johnny Depp. Johnny Who? You know, the guy who can't act and makes lousy movies. But the makers of this yawn-a-thon went one step further and put a munching in as leading lady. So what do you have? Dorky-looking guy and spooky-looking girly (who's idea was it to dye that mop?).This movie was dull almost from the beginning. And as with many recent Hollywood movies, when you don't have a decent script, throw in special effects. But even decent special effects can't save this thing.Now you might be thinking, &quot;Hey, this is a movie for kids.&quot; Hmmm, I thought so too, but I played it for an 8-year-old, and a bit into the movie she's asking me if there's anything on TV.But the scariest part in this movie isn't the Headless Horseman. It's wondering what kind of arrangement these two &quot;actors&quot; made with Satan in order to get paid the money they do to star in this highly flushable movie.But there is something positive to say about this movie: I managed to get a good nap. It was like taking a sedative. I was in and out of this thing, so I couldn't really tell you how the entire story was going.

190615,"Storm of the Century is an entertaining story with many of the basic Stephen King elements that we have grown to love over the years. The medium does have its problems, but the story is well worth the wait.First the  length: yes, yes, yes, the story does drag a little. This four hour movie  could have been easily edited to three and a half or less hours with little  loss. But I suspect that the story would never have been produced unless it  could be formatted for a mini-series, hence the length.As for the story,  I was struck by the obvious parallelism with Nathaniel Hawthorne's Young  Goodman Brown. In each story the protagonist is confronted by the devil and  the community's sins are revealed one person at a time. Young Goodman  Brown's wife, Faith, is eventually shown to be a potential follower of the  devil, while Molly Anderson betrays her husband near the story's end.Apart from this parallelism, I don't see a lot of common ground between  these two stories. Storm of the Century appears to have a different theme:  can a community, so compromised by personal wrongs, be expected to make  sound moral decisions.One has to give Stephen King credit, he didn't  flinch from this issue. The response is realistic down to the  rationalizations, excuses, and even the community's behavior when the  crisis passes.",N/A

478741,"&quot;Being John Malkovich&quot; is some sort of weird movie experience. You look in awe at the ideas the film has and how it executes them. I admired it more than I liked it for it's skillfull blend of dark humor,  originality and sweetness. It's daredevil fun, but it has the potential for  more. Though I enjoyed and do recommend it, I sort of expected more from a  movie about going into someone else's head. A tour of Malkovich's mind  would have been more entertaining than just looking out through his eyes  sockets. Still, it's a fun movie and sometimes thrilling in it's own  special way. &quot;Being John Malkovich&quot; is in a sense, some sort of  achievement.

121384,"I am a big fan of Clint Eastwood as a director. He is one of the few directors working today who has mastered the use of subtlety. In two of my favorites (Unforgiven and Absolute Power) he commands ensembles of actors  with ease and still maintains his use of small camera movements and letting  the characters small moments tell the story. However I think he out does  himself with A Perfect World. The slow and sure pacing of a master director  combined with a moving story and three of the best performances around. The  young boy, Costner, and Eastwood are all fabulous. This is a powerfully  moving story of missed chances and father/son regret. However I won't lie,  the film has one fatal flaw: Laura Dern is awful. If only they had simply  written her out completely this would have been a perfect film. But if you  can put her minor role aside this a great film worthy of your viewing.",N/A

If they were to watch it alone, late at night they would experience a whole new experience.  If you  let it, this film can involve you like no other.  I consider myself a  hardened horror fan desensitised by excessive dark viewing.  However, this  film resensitised (does that word exist?) me and invoked feelings of fear  and impending dread that i never thought possible for a film.  By the end  my chest felt bruised from the onslaught of my breath holding.  Many people  have criticised the ending of this film but maybe that's because they  didn't pay attention at the beginning to understand it, as has been the  case with many of the people that i've confronted.  In my opinion the  ending is one of the best and most disturbing i've ever seen and will haunt  you for weeks afterwards.  The low budget of this film is what makes It so  great. It achieves using no special effects what other movies spend  millions (and still fail) on trying to achieve.

470025,"I hadn't heard anything about this movie before I saw it so I didn't expect anything other than the usual Hollywood silliness. I was absolutely delighted to find it a winner. I thought the basic depiction of the ATC's was accurate enough, keeping in mind that it was all exaggerated to make dramatic, humorous, and at times, farcical, points. I do agree that in real life there would have been an awful lot of `say again's in response to Falzone's super-efficient instruction, and my suspension-of-disbelief ability got a bit strained at times. However, it's not a documentary. The ATC background is a set-up for the character-driven plot, and all the characters are multi-dimensional and wonderful, including all the supporting players, and I understood and loved them all. John Cusack is terrific as the tightly-controlled controller Falzone, and Billy Bob Thornton is hilariously morbid as the completely-in-control Russell Bell who gets on, and frays, Falzone's last nerve. Angelina Jolie is perfect as the spiraling-out-of-control tarty lush, as is Cate Blanchett as the housewife who's trying to retain control with her `life of the mind' evening classes. I didn't love the hokey ending, and I'm not saying it was the best movie I've ever seen, but as a comedy that managed to capture human strengths and frailties, not to mention paranoia, it was great.",Pushing Tin VHS
26208,"There's a lot to like and a lot not to like in this Monty Python cumCitizen Kane Orwellian Kafkaesque Luddite comedic satire of a RubeGoldberg bureaucracy in a retro-future.  Throw in a little sword andsorcery, a remembrance of some bad video games from eighties, a bit ofStar Wars, perhaps the sci-fi novels Level 7 and We, sprinkled withHitlerian mustaches on underdeveloped characters and you get thepicture.What's good is a script full of witty one-liners findingthe right target, the corporate and governmental bureaucracies, ourpreoccupation with petty power in the pecking order, and our fear ofageing (face lifts) or looking irregular (braces).  What's bad is thatDirector Terry Gilliam never got it under control.  I'm reminded ofwhat Mark Twain said about his magnum opus, ""Anyone attempting tofind a plot here will be shot."" The story is slight, lacking anytension and the sets are dark and cluttered to a point past annoyance.I would say the film needed editing for focus, but that would onlyhave spotlighted the poverty of the plot.Here's the problem in anutshell: recall the line of billboards on both sides of the road mileafter mile without a break.  Now that's a nice satire of where we'reheaded as corporate interests increasingly dominate the environment;however like a Rube Goldberg contraption, they don't work since thebillboards are too close for anybody to read them as the cars fly by!In a way the world depicted here is like a parallel universe in whicheverything is essentially the same but differs in a thousand details:the weird little cars, the ridiculous maze of ducts and cables for airconditioning, the oversized bills on the baseball caps, the singledesk sliding between two cubicle rooms, etc.We can see how Gilliamhas grown as a film maker by comparing this to 12 Monkeys, produced adecade later.  In 12 Monkeys there is not only an interesting storyand a subplot, but the characters are developed into flesh and blood.What I think Gilliam has realized is that no director, regardless ofhow brilliant, can long survive without catering in some way to themass audience.  Although Brazil ranks in IMDb's top 250 that is onlybecause movie enthusiasts naturally reward creativity.  Poll the massaudience however and you'll find a significant percentage thatcouldn't even sit through this film.  Notice too that while Gilliamwasted the talented Robert De Niro in Brazil he wised up and used starBruce Willis to the maximum in12 Monkeys.It will be interesting tosee what Gilliam does next.",N/A

130866,"For anyone who read the novel by Frank McCourt, ""Angela's Ashes"" would've been one of the most anticipated movies of the year.  The book, which is terrific, takes  you on an emotional roller coaster ride without cessation;  there are passages so gripping it becomes almost unbearable at times.  The  movie, however, directed by Alan Parker and starring Robert Carlyle and  Emily Watson, unfortunately doesn't come close to capturing the  desperation, hopelessness and pathos of the book.  McCourt's  autobiographical account of growing up in extreme poverty in Limerick,  Ireland, is a gut-wrenching experience; that he even survived his childhood  under such conditions as he recounts is a minor miracle in itself.  His  father, Malachy McCourt Sr., (played by Carlyle in the movie), wasn't a bad  man, in an evil sense; he was just no good.  He loved his family, but was  too weak, prideful and irresponsible to even begin to look after them at  all.  Though reasonably intelligent, apparently, he was nevertheless lazy  to the point of slothfulness, couldn't keep a job even if he lucked into  one, and most of the time didn't bother looking.  He never had money to  keep bread on the table, but somehow always managed to have enough for  tobacco and for a ""pint"" at one of the local pubs.  Carlyle, a fine actor  (great in ""The Full Monty""), never seems to get to the core of this  admittedly complex character; the ability to mine the depths of what really  made Malachy tick somehow eludes him.  His performance is passable, but  it's all on the surface.  Emily Watson fares little better with her  Angela.  A Gifted actress (Breaking the Waves"" and ""Hilary and Jackie""),  she handles what she is given to work with aptly enough, but there is so  much more that simply goes untapped.  She, too, never really seems to get  to the soul of Angela, whose whole life was nothing less than tragic.  And  with such rich source material from which to draw, it's puzzling as to how  this movie failed to deliver the emotional impact promised by the story.  That Parker chose to use the same voice as the novel to tell it is one  reason, possibly.  The matter-of-fact, stoic narrative that worked to great  advantage in the novel simply doesn't translate well to film, at least not  in this case.  Here, it merely falls flat; somehow it gives an ambivalence  to the proceedings that keeps the young McCourt, his family and their  circumstances, at arms length throughout.  Visually, the movie is stunning,  though; the cinematography successfully captures the bleakness of Limerick  and the surrounding countryside. Parker, however, fails to blend it all in  sufficiently enough with the actual story to make it effective.  Using the  same approach for visual content as he does for the emotional, he succeeds  only in presenting an image without enticement.  He asks his audience to  bring more to this than they can, given what they are being offered; it  simply isn't enough.  Still, it in no way diminishes the artistic merit of  the photography, which is, in fact, the high mark of this whole endeavor.  The young McCourt is portrayed in three successive stages of his youth by  Joe Breen, Ciaran Owens and Michael Legge; all able performances.  The  supporting cast includes Ronnie Masterson (Grandma Sheehan Keating),  Pauline McLynn (Aunt Aggie Keating), Liam Carney (Uncle Pa Keating) and  Eanna MacLiam (Uncle Pat Keating).  For those who haven't read the novel,  ""Angela's Ashes"" will provide some touching moments, though nothing  particularly memorable.  This should have been a ten-hanky movie; instead,  it leaves the tear ducts dry and the heart just a little empty.  This is an  unfulfilling rendering of McCourt's acclaimed account of his childhood and,  on a larger scale, the failure of society and of the Church to truly  minister to all it's members.  The humor, which is laced throughout the  novel, is lost here as well, which is nothing less than negligence on the  part of the filmmakers, because they have excluded what was undoubtedly one  of young McCourt's basic tools of survival.  In the end, then, this film,  which should have been remarkable, was one of the biggest disappointments  of the year.  And it's a pity, yes.  `Tis.",N/A

557055,"The filming and realism is fantastic in this movies. You must see the Battle scenes and the costumes. This story takes place in 1776, Benjamin Martin (Mel Gibson), a hero of the Fort Wilderness campaign, now a widower living in South Carolina with seven children to raise on his own, is once again confronted with war in ""The Patriot."" Mr. Martin believes in the cause, but has had enough of war and killing in his life, and is troubled by the prospect of leaving his children orphans if he must fight again; but as in real life, things happen that change your mind despite your beliefs and he soon realizes that he has no choice other than to join in the conflict. Mr. Gibson does a great job of capturing the inner conflict of a man torn between principle and necessity. He imbues him with the stoicism needed to shoulder responsibility, but also with the human touch required of fatherhood.Historically, whether or not ""The Patriot"" is accurate in detail is not really important. It is, after all, one man's story, a dramatization set against the backdrop of this particular conflict. That it conveys a sense of time, place and importance is what matters, and that it does.

They're just kids, mostly pretty wild kids at that.  Seriously, there are scenes in here that I can think of no other reason for their being included, beyond showing a good side to &quot;bad guys&quot; or showing a bad side to &quot;good guys&quot;.  This is very unusual in Hollywood, of course, and is probably a healthy, or at least thoughtful, approach.Beyond that, watch for all the up-and-comers in here.  Ben Affleck, Jason London, Joey Lauren Adams, and many others.  Oh, that reminds me. Watch Joey Lauran Adams' character, &quot;Simone&quot;.  She has the most lethal glances at her casual boyfriend, Jason London (&quot;Floyd&quot;, the quarterback) when she walks past him and sees him with other girls.

But the main reason it stands out is that it has a cast of experience and depth, including Michael Caine at his peak, Donald Sutherland, Robert Duvall and Donald Pleasance.

72992,"When I saw the first &quot;Terminator,&quot; I was hooked. I thought that it was one of the most fantastic combinations of sci-fi, action and drama I had ever seen.  I was reluctant about the sequel at first; I'd already been  exposed to insipid sequels to many films that couldn't hold a candle to the  original.  But then, I saw it, and I have loved it ever since.  This sequel  to James Cameron's 1984 movie adds to the story without diluting or  drastically changing the storyline, which is a great thing. It picks up  where the last one left off, albeit 10 years later. Another Terminator is  sent back in time to destroy the hope for all mankind.  This time, instead  of Sarah Connor (whose son is the future salvation for mankind in a  post-apocolyptic universe) being the target, it is her son John (who is  still a child) who becomes the subject of termination.  Rather than have  Schwarzenegger play the dreaded evil Terminator of the first film, Cameron  instead has him play a Terminator who has been reprogrammed to protect  young John from the dreaded T-1000 (Robert Patrick), who is a Terminator  with very advanced characteristics.  Sarah Connor herself has been  separated from her son, declared legally insane, and spent the years since  her first Terminator experience building herself up physically and  emotionally, becoming very military-like, to prepare for what she knows  will come.  It is up to John and his Terminator protector to save both her  and try to change the course of history as it will come to be known. But  can they do it?  Can they really alter the past in order to preserve  humanity?  And will they be able to avoid the T-1000 long enough to do it?  I was on the edge of my seat while these questions were being answered.  This film is the perfect blend of special effects and storyline, a great  sci-fi/action film with a very human heart.  It is great, and I love to  watch it whenever I get a chance.",N/A

224136,"The most successful Australian movie of all time, it became the most successful foreign movie of all time in the USA and the second highest grossing movie in the USA in 1986 (beaten only by Top Gun). Paul Hogan's  movie debut and his first serious acting role - his only previous acting  experience was in comedy sketches in his Australian TV show.  This was the  movie which sparked the Aussie craze of the late 1980s in the US.  It is a  fairly innocuous fish out of water tale featuring a knockabout bushman and  a savvy American newspaper reporter.  The first half of the movie shows  reporter Sue Charlton (Linda Kozlowski) in the Australian outback while in  the second half the tables are turned and Mick Dundee (Hogan) finds himself  coming to grips with life in New York.  The film suffers in the  transformation to video - the spectacular scenes shot in Australia's Kakadu  National Park and the breathtaking vista of New York City are but a pale  whimper on the small screen and some of the continuity problems are  magnified, specifically the scene in the back seat of the taxi.  But they  are small beer when you consider the feel good impact of this film and its  achievement in raising the profile of Australia in the US.  Hogan became  Australian of the Year in 1987 as a result of this film and his  &quot;shrimp on the barbie&quot; tourism commercials.

421116,"An effective blend of professionalism, courage in adversity, and the heroism of common people distinguish this classic Western.  There is a subtle irony in this film that elevates it above the typical  action-adventure movie.  The wise old man of the village is right when he  asserts, after the gunfire subsides and the dead are buried, that only the  farmers won.  The farmers symbolize the timeless struggle of daily life.  The commitment to domestic responsibility and the work ethic of parents as  they strive to provide for a family is recognized as heroic and enduring.  The vaunted freedom and machismo of the wandering gunfighter is exposed as  myth.  To each perceived advantage of living by the gunman's code there is  a counter-point of a lonely life with no focal point.  The gunfighters are  compared to a great wind that rids the farmers of a locust plague, but is  unwelcome when its task is done.  Violence is anathema to raising crops,  increasing herds, and nurturing children.Subtlety aside, the surface  appeal of the movie is its exciting tale of the seven hired guns that help  a Mexican village battle a ruthless bandit gang.  Yul Brynner does well as  the stoic leader of the Seven.  His &quot;gunfighter in black&quot; image  has become a minor icon of American film lore.  At the time, the casting of  obscure young actors as the rest of the Seven was brilliantly done.  Steve  McQueen's too cool performance is especially effective.  James Coburn,  Robert Vaughn, and Charles Bronson are great as the smooth professionals  calmly confronting arrogant amateurs.  Eli Wallach as the strutting bandit  chief is simultaneously sinister and comic.  His pontificating on the  decline of religion and the shameless women's fashions of the day while his  gang openly steal from the village is hiliarious dark comedy.The film is  ably directed by John Sturges.  The movie mixes the familiar Western  elements with a dash of Ernest Hemingway's concept of courage in adversity  and Howard Hawks' philosophy of professionalism.  Its quiet tribute to the  daily heroism of common people is unusual and commendable for its insight.  A legendary film score adds to the excitement.  The enjoyment of this movie  increases with each viewing.  Highly recommended.",The Magnificent Seven VHS

True, there was a climax, but there was no building towards it.  It just sort of happened.What saved this movie, in my eyes, was the fact that the characters were so well developed and so engaging, that I didn't mind the fact that the story was missing a plot.  Michael Caine, Tobey Maguire, Charlize Theron, and Delroy Lindo all give brilliant performances.  Erykah Badu does an excellent job as the daughter of Delroy Lindo's character.

I was surprised at this since, normally, when a movie doesn't have a plot, I lose interest.  That was definitely not the case here.

Did you miss that Michael just did not want to be legitimate,  he wanted to essentially take over the world? Even if it meant buying off  and/or getting rid of the Vatican? That's pretty powerful stuff. And he  would have done so, it if wasn't for the night of his son's Sicilian opera  debut... The scene of an aged Michael (who looked almost exactly like the  older Vito) dying alone in his chair speaks volumes, too.Friends,  friends, friends--this is a great movie...the overall pacing, the acting,  the cinematography, the dialog, the story, the colors make this a great,  though imperfect, film which only improves with repeat viewing.

The only things I can recommend about this DVD are the nice widescreen presentation, Dean Cundy is an excellent cinematographer, and Carpenter's wonderful music score.

66963,"This is a mixture of Sir Alfred Hitchcock's directorial productions from both the Silver and Television screens. Hitchcock directed several episodes from his half-hour TV series. ""Lamb to the Slaughter"" is one of the best. Barbara Bel Geddes was excellently cast. In ""PSYCHO"" and ""VERTIGO"" we see characters tormented by their own uncontrollable obsessions. In ""PSYCHO"" Hitchcock attempts to metaphorically unveil some hidden episode in his life that has driven him as a film director. In his masterpiece ""VERTIGO,"" Hitchcock unveils the character within the director to his public in attendance, embodying, in James Stewart's character his own obsessions and desire to physically reconstruct women in an unobtainable image created by his own psyche. This is also peripherally evident in ""MARNIE.""  Kim Novak's character in ""VERTIGO"" is an actress of disposition, a woman whose role-playing supports one man (Gavin Elster and Hitchcock) in captivating another (&quot;Scottie&quot; Ferguson and the viewer). In ""PSYCHO"" we see Norman Bates physically alter his own appearance driven by a distorted obsession to satisfy his mother against his own desires for the touch of women. By becoming his mother he frees himself of his own guilt and his failures as a man and simultaneously satisfies his mother's wishes for him by carrying those wishes to fruition. Scottie, the main character of ""VERTIGO,"" and Novak's in the role of a woman who feels compelled to deny her own identity and allow herself to be degraded in order to satisfy the men who ask her to act their schemes and fantasies, is equally intriguing. This is similar in ""MARNIE"" but with a twist. Marnie satisfies her own hidden passions as she degrades men, in her eyes, by stealing from them. What both Scottie and Hitchcock look for in their perfect woman is the erotic, carnal female disguised within the gray suit and pinned-back hair. Again, this was very evident with Sean Connery as Mark Rutland in ""MARNIE."" Strutt tells an interested Mark Rutland that ""she (Marnie) hides her legs like some national treasure."" Scottie (and Hitchcock) are unattracted to Barbara Bel Geddes' candid and thus uninteresting Midge, who clearly lacks feminine mystique. Madeleine, by contrast, is never as forthcoming remaining distant and enigmatic and is all the more alluring because of it. When she tries to reveal something of her true self, Judy Barton to Scottie, he resists her, becoming all the more determined in his obsessive confusion of illusion and reality. Equally, Mark Rutland wants to hear none of Marnie's pleas to release her when she attempts to tell him that she is not what he thinks. ""I've got hold of something really wild this time and I don't intend to let go."" In ""PSYCHO"" Norman Bates really has something wild, several things in fact. His stuffs birds in response to a repressed sexual state that his mother has subjugated him to. Bates does have something wild and he equally will never be able to consummate his desires just as Scottie ultimately never will. Hitchcock gives himself an escape route in the character of Mark Rutland, but that is left to the imagination of the audience. By revealing the murder plot midway through ""VERTIGO,"" Hitchcock deepens our psychological understanding of the characters and their romantic dynamics.  Freeing us from Scottie's point of view, Hitchcock allows us to study his romantically idealized fixation in an objective light that reveals its hopelessness, at the same time letting us sympathize with Judy, who becomes the victim of his quixotic fixation. As Hitchcock pointed out, Scottie's relentless pursuit of the image becomes a &quot;form of necrophilia.&quot; It also makes him a voyeur who observes and imagines rather than acts in the real world. In ""PSYCHO"" Norman Bates literally acts out his &quot;form of necrophilia.&quot; However, Bates does not have actual sexual consummation. His sexual release is symbolic in the form of slashing, cutting and bloodletting. Afterward he is at peace with his mother until the urges of his passions overcome in. His mother remains ever present. In ""VERTIGO,"" when Scottie really does lose his ideal image, Madeleine, to death, he can no longer function and must re-create her in the new Judy. The person under the disguise means nothing to him, however; all that matters is that she looks and act like the ideal woman. His love is in fact not love at all but a romanticized fetish, a yearning for an unobtainable image that is forever lost. A happy ending to his dilemma is not possible. Unlike Scottie, Mark Rutland is able unravel the enigma that is Marnie and in doing so he is released from his own fetish and is given the possibility to pursue real love with her. Norman Bates remains trapped by the fixation of his mother's hold on him. Norman Bates like Scottie is reaching out and trying to obtain the unobtainable. Scottie can not return the love lost. Bates can never satisfy the whims of his mother, which prevents him from love he was never even permitted to explore.",N/A

519402,"This is a dramatic triumph; a gripping story of the battle between truth and corruption in the sacred halls of mass media news. Based on the true story of Jeffrey Wigand, the research scientist from Brown and Williamson  Tobacco who blows the whistle on the industry's attempts to chemically  enhance the addictive effects of nicotine, this story grabs you like an  anaconda and slowly squeezes you until you are out of breath.The plot  follows Lowell Bergman, a producer for 60 Minutes, as he first stumbles  across Wigand (Russell Crowe), convinces him to do an interview and then  battles to get the interview aired after Brown and Williamson threatens CBS  with a lawsuit. This is reality based drama at its finest. For once, we  have a real story that is not rendered dubious by  over-dramatization.Michael Mann directs his third consecutive triumph.  He only does one project every three or four years, but what he lacks in  frequency he more than delivers in quality. I liked all aspects of his  direction, but I was particularly impressed with his use of the camera.  Mann has all the various camera techniques honed to perfection, but what is  most impressive is his appropriateness in using technique in a scene to  maximize effect. If he gives us an extreme close-up or a foreground blur,  it is exactly what is needed for maximum impact in the scene. He uses  technique to enhance the scene rather than using the scene as an excuse to  show off technique, a disease that seems to have become epidemic,  especially among hip young directors.Mann brings us taut drama with a  relevant message. He provides well defined characters that hook the  audience emotionally. His pace is always appropriate with moments of  frenetic action augmented by dramatic buildup and suspense.The acting in  this film was uniformly excellent. Pacino is at his finest in this role. It  is clear that he had a real passion for the part unlike his stilted and  phony performance in `The Devil's Advocate'. As in `Heat', I believe that  Mann has again brought forth Pacino's maximum dynamism and squeezed out of  him every bit of his brilliance.Russell Crowe elevated his game to a new  level with this film. Though I found his performance a bit uneven, he  brought great power to the role (perhaps a bit too much), and transcended  his previous best performance in `LA Confidential' by a wide margin. This  was a complex and difficult character, reserved and intellectual yet highly  emotional and explosive. This is a combination that doesn't usually come in  the same package. Crowe nailed the reserved intellectual part, but was  overwrought in the angry scenes, coming across more like an action hero  than the incensed nerd he was supposed to be playing. However, this is a  picayune criticism of what was on the whole a fabulous performance.This  is one of the better dramas I have seen in a while. I rated it a 9/10. It  is well written, well acted and well directed. What more can you ask?",N/A
76613,"It is now accepted that &quot;The Terminator&quot;, the predecessor of Terminator 2: Judgment Day, is a classic science fiction film. This was not immediately obvious to a lot of people who only gave T1 the nod after the  success of T2. I am happy to lavish praise on both movies.  Consider though  that T1 had a production budget of less than one fifth of T2 and you may  start to get a feel for what an outstanding job was done on it.Terminator is the story of a young woman, (Sarah Connor), being  stalked. When you get down to it, that is the essence of the film and also  the source of the suspense and empathy we feel for that character. We can  all imagine what it would be like to have your life placed at risk at the  hands of a persistent murderer.Where this film pushes the envelope  is that the stalker is a cyborg, (part mechanical, part organic), killing  machine, (Terminator), from the future. Everyone else has said it so I may  as well. Schwartzenegger was perfectly cast in the role of an emotionless  machine of destruction. It's mission to assassinate the mother of John  Connor, who was to later in time become the leader of an army that opposed  the terminator's creator, Skynet.  Said creator being a self aware computer  that had taken control of the world by using the automated nuclear defence  grid.Sarah has an ally in the form of a soldier who volunteered to  travel from the future to protect the mother of his commander against the  Terminator. Played by Michael Biehn, Kyle Reese is determined to save the  woman that he loves. He managed to fall for Sarah before he had even met  her, through a faded Polaroid that John Connor gave him some years earlier.  In my opinion, it is Biehn that shines in this picture. Yes, the rest of  the actors were excellent but this was the first major film that Bein was  in and he was nothing short of brilliant. I think that a large part of the  horror we feel towards the terminator is a reflection of Reese's attitude  and reactions to it. If this obviously tough and battle scarred veteran is  brought nearly to the edge of hopelessness then you just know the bad guy  is a serious problem.Terminator was a fast paced film with a  relentless series of suspenseful chases and terrifying action sequences.  I  could not at the time imagine a film that could be as gripping, that is  until I saw Judgment Day, otherwise known as T2. Same plot only with the  roles exchanged. This time the victim is John Connor a twelve year old boy,  the original terminator, still played by Schwartzenegger, is the protector,  (reprogrammed in the future). The bad guy is also a terminator, but this  time it is an advanced prototype, (T-1000). No longer a Cyborg but a living  metal organism that can flow into any shape it desires.If I  thought the first terminator was relentless then the T-1000 is unstoppable.  Well, at least until he faced the newly buffed Sarah Conner in the dramatic  finale. The special effects in T2 were ground braking and the attention to  detail was flawless in every part of the movie. I have never met anyone who  didn't walk out of the cinema after T2 with a look of stunned awe on their  face.",N/A
204551,"The first Marx Bros. film that was written directed for the scream is also one of their best. One of their most energetic yet still feels a little stagy. A fast paced zany riot that has the 4 brothers creating havoc as  bumbling stowaways. Filled with memorable routines like the one that has  the 4 brothers trying to pass off as Maurice Chevalier. Madness, sight gags  and puns abound but as always Groucho gets the most laughs and the best  jokes. The ending in the barn is a knockout. Nonstop laughs in this  memorable and hilarious Marx Bros. films. Along with Buster Keaton, W.C.  Fields and Laurel &amp; Hardy, The Marx Bros. are American comic landmarks  and this is one of their best films. I would also recommend 'Duck Soup'  (their best), 'A Night At The Opera' (their second best) and 'Horse  Feathers'. From a scale of 1-10 I give this film a 7!",N/A

The crisp b&amp;w photography has been restored to the original  pristine quality and one can easily see why this film took home the Oscar  for best cinematography. The sound is also superb. The DVD is loaded with  extra features such as the original opening monologue to the British  release (voiced by director Carol Reed), a reading of the novel by author  Graham Greene, archival footage of the sewer system &quot;police&quot; in  Vienna (which plays a significant part in the film), and numerous stills  with tantalizing behind the scenes information (like the fact that Orson  Welles was so put off by working in the actual sewers that he refused to  return and the crew had to build a sewer set at Shepperton Studios).

For both actors, it's a definite change of pace. Boris chews the scenery as the radiation-poisoned scientist, while Bela effectively underplays his part as the sympathetic colleague. The film might have been stronger if Karloff and Lugosi had switched roles. Still, ""The Invisible Ray"" survives as a memorable chiller and John Fulton's special effects are excellent.",Invisible Ray VHS

Michael Caine in a move to shed off his &quot;lovable&quot; Cockney 60s persona's (eg. Alfie, The Italian Job etc)stars as Jack Carter, a mid-level London criminal who decides to go back to his hometown in Newcastle to find out the real reasons behind his brother's recent death.Upon arrival he cuts a path through the local crims and con men to find out &quot;...what really happened&quot;. This film is just so entertaining. Caine has never been better. He's icy cool and malevolent, has the right quip for any occaision and will stop at nothing to reach his goal. The Tyneside locations are absolutely perfect in reflecting both the urban and moral decay that seems to prevail, Hodges' direction is tight and well paced, Roy Budd's music is eerie and loaded with 70s cool, all the supporting characters have their own moments, the dialogue is great and the action setpieces are gritty and realistic, and above all (as was the late 60s - mid 70s practice) no charcter comes out of this film a winner.I have been burning for the DVD release of this film for some time now and I cannot wait to see the film remastered and with a bunch of extras. Having finally got to see it at the cinema recently has only fanned the flames further.This is a wonderful, wonderful film (especially if you like crime films) and the recent news of Sly Stallone's remake fills me with horror.

I could easily put myself in the position of the  woman in the film, and it was a position where I definitely would want to  be!

319780,"I hate made-for-tv-movies.  Ninety-nine percent of these movies are unadulterated trash, and I can count the good ones without taking my shoes off.  After reading all the reviews, I decided (very hesitantly) to take a  chance with ""Gettysburg"", and I'll tell you now that I'm glad I did.I'm  no civil war buff, but if there was one thing that could coerce me to go  out and research the civil war it was this movie (along with a multi-part  PBS special on that war).  Matter-of-fact, I intend to seek out and  purchase the book ""Killer Angels"" as well as the PBS special.Obviously,  not everything in this movie was done to perfection.  There are scenes that  don't quite work.  The mass attacks that showed hand-to-hand combat are  extremely difficult to pull off in any movie.  It's almost impossible to  find a film that can handle these scenes with the realism and ferocity that  is required, and this film was no exception.  One could easily tell that  these were only actors and extras rolling about (sometimes doing a credible  job, often times not).  However, this is a minor quibble.  As for the fake  beards, most people of that era wore mustaches and beards that were  outlandish by today's standards, so this did not bother me at all.  Indeed,  I thought they portrayed the facial hair pretty accurately.  As far as the  portrayal of General Lee, I don't know that much about him to comment with  any authority.  However, this film didn't portray him as the military  genius I thought he must have been.  But then again, he did lose this  battle...probably the most important battle of the war, so I guess nobody  is perfect.I agree heartily with the Amazon review, in that the climax  of the film occurred at the end of the first tape--Chamberlain's defence of  Little Round Top.  This was brilliant film making, and nothing prior to, or  after, had near as much impact.  This part alone is worth the purchase  price of the movie.  Hats off to the director and to Daniels' heartfelt  performance.  It was truly unforgettable, and ranks among the best battle  scenes ever filmed.""Gettysburg"" was a film that detailed the great  battle with uncanny insight, not only about the heroic men who fought and  died, but also the terrible mistakes that were made.  In three days of  battle, there were more American lives lost than in the ten years of  Vietnam.  All-in-all, I found this to be a rewarding film and a real eye  opener.  Between 1 and 10, I give ""Gettysburg"" a solid 8, and I'm very  happy to have it in my movie collection.",Gettysburg VHS
446125,"Rarely has a legitimate theatre musical been so carefully and lovingly transferred to the big, wide screen.  The creators researched their  material meticulously and while certain liberties were taken for dramatic  enhancement, many of the historical events portrayed were authentic and  consistent in spirit with Grieg's life.This was originally a  broadway production from the operetta venue and while some of the original  numbers were dropped, many new numbers were added which enriched the  story.But most of all, this is a glorious musical.  The scenery is  breathtaking, filmed in many of the original locations where the events  took place.  The choreography and music set a new standard in support of  the musical numbers.  The singing is glorious.  Florence Henderson is  wonderful as Nina Grieg.  Her voice is a pure, heartwarming soprano.  Remember that she was a musical-comedy star of considerable stature long  before the Brady Bunch.  Frank Poretta is charismatic as Richard Nordraak,  Grieg's long time friend and gives us a rich, powerful voice to boot.  Torav Maurstad is Norwegian and portrays Grieg with meaning and affection.  He is not a professional singer but his voice suffices as a composer  singing his own songs.The other supporting players add depth to  the story line and the choreography is spectacular.  The sound track, not  available as yet on CD, is beautifully transferred from the film and is a  colector's item in itself.There is a marvelous Christmas sequence  filmed high in a snow-packed retreat and an animated troll number set to  Peer Gynt's Suite that is delightful at any age.What a rare treat  for music lovers. This movie would be a most welcome addition to collectors  and lovers of truly memorable movie musicals--one of the two or three best  in my memory.

524960,"A writer/director can take only so much artistic license before a story that is supposedly truth-based turns into a sham.  Jonathan Mostow runs dangerously close to that line.  The list of inaccuracies and improbabilities in this film is lengthy.  As has been noted numerous times, the British and not the Americans cracked the enigma code.  There were no blacks serving with whites on submarines, due to the segregation policy of the U.S. military before 1946.  The Germans were not evil, cold-blooded killers who strafed unarmed survivors.  The likelihood of a single torpedo hitting a ship showing only a bow profile is astronomically low, etc., etc., etc..If you put aside the fact that this was pure fantasy rather than fact-based fiction, this film was great entertainment.  The story was engrossing, the action was non-stop and the suspense was extremely well done.  Mostow uses every submarine film device ever invented and gives the crew a continual flow of crises to solve.  Yes, it smacked of U.S. nationalism to a fault and the music was so insipidly patriotic it became corny.  However, though this was a shamelessly derivative work, it was intense and twisty with great special effects, and that made it worth watching.Many people have compared this film with ""Das Boot"", concluding that this film pales by comparison to that classic.  ""Das Boot"" is one of my all time favorite films, but I really don't think you can compare the two.  They were really telling completely different types of stories.  ""Das Boot"" was a highly realistic character study and ""U-571"" was a fantasy action/adventure flick.  The only thing that they had in common was the fact that they each took place inside a German submarine.The acting was nothing special, but in defense of the cast, the film wasn't really about the characters so they didn't have much to do except look tense.  The best performance was delivered by Harvey Keitel as Chief Klough, the old sea dog who held the crew together.  Matthew McConaughey was hollow and wooden.  This was not one of his better performances.Despite a long list of grievances, this film still delivers high power entertainment and rises above its many flaws.  I rated it a 7/10.  Be prepared to suspend a ton of disbelief and then enjoy the ride.",U-571
329777,"Too tired of Hollywood's overdone coming-of-age fused + love themes? Well, Flirting, despite its superfluous title which almost misled me, is a complex film with a heavy touch of sincerity and authenticity.  One of  those rare films which really give the audience a creepy sensation of  gaping at characters' on-going lives as if peeping from the small window of  a dark room, the main &quot;flirting&quot; grows between 2 misfits from 2  worlds as distant as an all-boy school and an all-girl school sitting  across a lake.Wonderful acting here by Noah Taylor who breathes the  air of a stuttering outsider--Danny Embling, a much teased &quot;geek&quot;  who finds solace in mental superiority in a conformitist boarding school  setting. Also, before moving onto bigger things such as Beloved, Thandie  Newton portrays a fiery Ugandan beauty very much ostracised by her racist  surroundings. What nourishes the feeble threat that first hold the two  lonely hearts together is their shared vision of intellectual, political,  as well as sexual freedom. An odd romance springs between the two as they  carry on subtle flirting on debate teams, across the lake as DAnny rows to  another midnite rendezvous, and eventually an exploration of the body that  is by no means marred by its intensity.Certainly without the banal  lightheartedness of jovial teen movies made too frequently in the U.S.,  director John Duigan masters the art of manipulating an audience in this  1991 film, also featuring a young Nicole Kidman, brilliant in her pivotal  role of a supressed head girl carefully protecting the fragile young love  she senses Danny and Thandiwe. Dark and deep into youthful souls, Flirting  brings to mind serious matters such as Uganda's Idi Amin years.  Our  star-crossed young lovers never whisper the sweet word &quot;love&quot;  into each other's ears, yet through every touch and every glimpse, the  audience is led into a sweet realm of love in its purest form w/out being  tainted by physical emphasis, but rather decorated with lavish strokes of  reality--Danny and Thandiwe's compromise between lust and respect.",N/A

199034,"My favorite Marx Brothers movie is &quot;A Night at the Opera,&quot; but this political satire, which was banned in Italy by Mussolini, is a very close second.  It is definitely the best (and last) Marx Brothers movie with Zeppo, for what that is worth.  As Groucho later pointed out, Zeppo's roles as the group's straight man were thankless.  It was not that Zeppo lacked talent, but rather that he had three older brothers.&quot;In Duck Soup,&quot; the mythical nation of Freedonia is in trouble and Mrs. Teasdale (Margaret Dumont) insists that the reigns of power be turned over to Rufus T. Firefly (Groucho).  Ambassador Trentino (Louis Calhern) of the neighboring country of Sylvania employs a couple of spies, Chicolini (Chico) and Pinky (Harpo), to shadow Firefly.  Oh, and Firefly has a secretary, Bob Rolland (Zeppo).  Many of the most famous sequences by the Brothers Marx are found in this film: (1) The mirror sequence between Groucho and Harpo (if it had been Groucho and Chico instead Groucho would have asked &quot;Are you my reflection&quot; and Chico would have answered &quot;Sure&quot;); (2) Harpo's encounter with street vendor Edgar Kennedy, master of the slow-burn (&quot;  &quot;); (3) The &quot;We're Going to War&quot; take off on 1930s musicals (&quot;They've got guns, we've got guns, all God's chil'en got guns&quot;); (4) Groucho offering Chico the position of Secretary of War (&quot;Sold!&quot;); (5) Harpo offering Grouch a ride in the sidecar of his motorcyle (&quot;This is the third trip I've taken today and I still haven't gone anywhere&quot;); (6) Zeppo introducing the new leader of Freedonia, Rufus T. Fireflay (&quot;Whatever it is, I'm against it.&quot;); and much, much more, including the lovely Rachel Torres as the lovely Vera Marcal!&quot;Duck Soup&quot; was helped by several factors. With director Leo McCarey the Marx Brothers finally had a first rate director who understood how to stage and shoot the action.  The Bert Kalmar and Harry Ruby screenplay does one of the better jobs of integrating the various comic routines into the overall story.  After an absence of two films Margaret Dumont was back where she belonged, trying to stay above the insanity with no success whatsoever.  Louis Calhern is arguably the ideal villain for the Marx Brothers because in scene after scene he plays it absolutely straight, without losing his dignity or becoming laughable (similar to the marvelous job by Kitty Carlisle in &quot;A Night at the Opera&quot;).Final tidbit: When the town of Fredonia, New York complained about its name being used in the film (the extra &quot;e&quot; did not matter for some reason,&quot; Groucho shot back: &quot;Change the name of your town, it's hurting our picture.&quot;  And, as always, please remember that the correct pronunciation of Leonard's stage name is &quot;Chick-o&quot; not &quot;Cheek-o.&quot;  The man liked the ladies and was not a young Hispanic male.",N/A

Unfortunately, that included this filmBack in college, Parker did a play about some guy in Colorado history called Alfred Packer. Later, he made a movie out of it. No one would publish it until he became famous, at which point the great Troma team published itThis is a musical. Like most Parker films, this one is about Mormons. About half dialog, half singing. Standard cast (Matt Stone, Screech, other UColorado alumni). Surprisingly, there are almost no jokes here - this isn't really a comedy. Well, maybe it is since all the characters act odd (stone is a liar, parker loves his horse, Screech wants to have sex, another guy is always happy), but no one really tells jokes or does anything really unrealistic. Despite supposedly being a cannibal movie, it's not really shocking or antisocial. It's just sort of a historical pic with some really bad songs (the reporter's love song, the schpedoinkle day song). Oh yeah, the plot - Parker (Alfred Packer) leads a bunch of mormons to colorado in the winter.

Here, Hitomi is a girl on a track team who has visions of the future and is drawn into the world of Gaea with Van, prince of Fanel, who somehow reached our world while battling a dragon.  Van, by defeating the dragon, earns the right to be king and be bonded with a magical suit of giant armor (essentially, the magical equivalent of the gundams in Gundam Wing) called Escaflowne.  War soon reaches Fanel, and the story proceeds with massive battles between the robots, political intrigue, and the mysteries of Gaea being slowly peeled away.This series hits the ground running and has everything you could ask for.  The designs of the giant robots are wonderful.  The score is a fabulous mix of classical music and something like a Gregorian chant.  The animation is rather fluid for a television series.  The character designs are unusual, especially for their long, pointy noses.  One interesting feature is that Hitomi is obviously not meant to be the usual beautiful heroine with whom all the men are madly falling in love.  Finally, the English dub is fine; the voices are done by the same studio which voiced the Gundam Wing dub.

At the end of '77s the Spy Who Loved Me, it had said, &quot;JAMES BOND WILL  RETURN IN FOR YOUR EYES ONLY.&quot;  Only after the success of Star Wars,  as the DVD's documentary will tell you, did they decide to go with Ian  Fleming's 1950-something novel based on that success.  Right on to Cubby  because he was right, the Bond series hit the peak with this absolute dud,  &quot;raking&quot; (haha) in the most money ever.  The problem is that the  wit of Fleming was taken out from its book and used for pure sensationalism  because of what was popular at the moment.I am a James Bond enthusiast.

It actually offends me to see people complimenting this film because this  movie goes against every thing that is about the series.

I'm glad that the series bounced  back in '81 with For Your Eyes Only, otherwise who knows where the series  would be today.The reason I gave this movie two stars instead of one is  because the film has two really good things about it, all in the first  fifteen minutes:  the parachute chase before the credits and the theme  song.  After then turn the film off because you aren't missing anything and  then watch the extras because no matter how dumb the movie is the extras  are always interesting, despite the fact that this film is the least  features-laden disc of the 5-DVD set.",N/A
475162,"Do not expect a twisted and mangled complicated plot or mellodramatic characters; There are none. For 90 minutes the viewer is treated to an out of order (whether the sequences are imagined or will become real remain to  be seen) story. The plot is of a man released from prison who wants answers  from a multi-millionaire music producer regarding the truth behind his  daughter's suspicious death.Terence Stamp's performance as the Limey is  what will keep the viewer's attention; He turns in one helluva performance  as a semi-rough around the edges yet-sophisticated English/Cockney gent  released from prison. The Limey almost comes across as a Charles Bronson  character, who despite his older man physical attributes, is still able to  do major damage control to those who cross his path and try to hinder his  &quot;investigation&quot;. He uses his somewhat subtle Cockney charm and  accent to accomplish his mission ( check out the scene where he is  explaining his actions in his thick accent to an interrogating police  detective; it's both critical and yet humorous).Is The Limey a sleep  inducer? No. Is it an action flick? No. However, when the scenes with the  Limey going in for the kill, what little action, are worth it with a  bang!The dvd transfer is clear and right on target with regards to color  and sharp images. The 5.1 Dolby Surround track delivers quite a punch (pun  intended). As a viewer with center channel capability I felt like I was  receiving the wallops in the bar scene !For anyone who thinks they  recognize Terence Stamp from a previous current film, they're right. He  appeared in Lucas' Phantom Menace as Chancellor Vallorum who was ousted  from his seat by Queen Amidala and the senate.I recommend this video for  it's strong characters and 90 minute length.

36429,"The Green Mile had so much potential it's unbelievable. A Frank Darabont (Shawshank Redemption)prison drama starring Tom Hanks based on a Stephen King novel. If that is not a sure fire Hollywood recipe for success then I  don't know what is.Unfortunately the results are more mixed than you  might expect. There are a great many things that are done badly with The  Green Mile and no matter what anyone will tell you The Green Mile did not  deserve its Oscar nomination. Not in a million years.First of all the  Green Mile is incessantly long. With a movie like Magnolia, Braveheart or  Casino I don't mind investing three hours of my time watching something  great. The Green Mile is not one of those movies however but is, in fact, a  melodramatic bore could have been at least 30-45 minutes shorter.The  story is, like the Shawshank Redemption, a very uplifting tale. The  Shawshank Redemption however was far more clever and avoided the usual  Hollywood cliches when tugging on the heart strings. The Green Mile  embraces every single little cliche known to man and beats them to death.  If you really love movies then you will be able to see everything coming  ten miles down the road. The Green Mile manipulates the viewer again and  again in the most predictable fashion. I think we all knew the stupid cute  little mouse would be involved somewhere didn't we? That mouse is perhaps  the most offensively obvious attempt at manipulation I have ever seen in a  film. Why not throw Old Yeller in there as well just for the cheap  sympathy. I remember when the mouse first entered the movie screen I heard  a collective &quot;Ohhhhhh&quot; from the crowd followed by even a few  people saying &quot;he's so cute.&quot; I thought to myself, you saps.  Don't get me wrong, there is nothing wrong with a movie having some emotion  but come on, if you fall for this old trick then you do have  problems.Tom Hanks does his usual &quot;good&quot; role like we have all  seen at least 5 times before. This one is kind of a Saving Private Ryan  meets Apollo 13 role with a Forrest Gump accent thrown in for good measure.  I don't think there's an actor alive in more need to play a villain than  Tom Hanks, just to add a little assortment to his know stupefyingly boring  roles. Michael Clarke Duncan plays the big teddy bear prisoner on death  row, he got an Oscar nod but he's boring too. David Morse is the best thing  acting wise ont he screen, he's restricted to small parts however and  cannot flex his talent enough here.Overall the Green Mile is long, dull  and extremely overated. I can see why a lot of people did like this film  but I've seen this plenty of times before and done far better.",N/A

285029,"If I could give one film more than 5 stars this film would be it.  ""Twelve Angry Men"" is an atmospheric, hard-hitting film about the life or death decision that twelve jurors have to make in seemingly cut and dried case of  patricide.  On the surface, the nameless accused seems guilty but one  juror, played magnificently by Henry Fonda isn't so sure.  Forcing his  companions to reevaluate the case opens a can of worms as the prejudice,  indifference, and ignorance of his fellow jurors become all too apparent.  There are many stereotypes in this film, such as the angry father played  J.Cobb, and Jack Klugman of Quincy fames is excellent as the young man who  has pulled himself out of the slums and knows more than his fair share  about switch-blades and how to use them.  Fonda, however is the King-Pin in  this film, drawing the many characters together, from the gentle, quiet  immigrant watchmaker, to the handsome but stupid Advertising Executive.  At  first the film moves slowly, almost sedately, but it quickly gathers  momentum, giving you tense moments such as the secret ballot at the  beginning, to the power struggle between Fonda and the enraged spurned  father in the guise of Cobb.  Fonda's stand against his fellow jurors is  bittersweet as he strives to convince them the case might not be as cut and  dried as they think.  Full of tense moments, quality acting, and  surprisingly good male bonding scenes as temporary friendships and  alliances are set up as more and more of the jurors become aware that the  boy on trial just might be innocent.  The steamy heat in the jury room is  not just from the stifling heat wave that the city is going through rather  it is symbolic of the tension between the men, and the breaking of the  weather is also the breaking of the group into two factions; those who  still think the boy is guilty and those who have reasonable doubt.  The  1997 remake of this film was instantly forgettable, lacking the atmosphere  and chemistry of the 1957 version.  Sidney Lumet's""12 Angry Men"" is  testament to brilliant acting, a superb script and suspenseful directing.  Quite simply the best film ever made in my opinion.",N/A

I think Universal has done a great job in both of these areas.  I hate it when studios use a bad print to make the DVD -- THE LOST WORLD looks crisp and the colors are fine.The bonus stuff is pretty cool.  The storyboards and preproduction paintings are very attractive and very interesting.  The cut scenes are fun to see -- the more I watch cut scenes on DVDs, the more I realize WHY scenes get cut.  Included on THE LOST WORLD disc is a 3 minute scene of an IMAGIN Board Meeting where the members vote Hammond (Richard Attenborough) out of the company.  Yawn.  The plot point is handled in a later scene where, with one line (&quot;They're voting me out of the company&quot;), the information is relayed simply and quickly.  Movie-making is so interesting!Anyway, like others have said, THE LOST WORLD is no JURASSIC PARK, but it is fun in its own ways.

It  incorporates all sorts of adult themes that I was not expecting...  his  domination fantasies where he dreams of having sex with his student instead  of with his wife, his affair, and then in the end he still loses and she  wins, and the cycle continues in its inherent truth.

Yes it is all those  things, and others have said plenty along those lines.  But it really makes  the film sound a lot more boring than it actually is, for this is one of  those rare films where you actually become interested in, and sometimes are  even moved by, the fate of the characters.At 170 minutes the film is  long, but never tedious.  Those of you who really hate long films can watch  this in 2 sittings - the sequence dealing with the Soviet invasion of  Prague is the natural divider.  (BTW I was quite impressed by how  seamlessly the main characters were weaved into actual documentary  footages.)  The story is intense, but not ponderous.  The plot unfolds at a  leisurely pace allowing the viewer to soak in the stunning imageries, while  the story was engrossing enough to make you forget the passage of time.  The acting, btw, was superb.  Juliet Binoche really shines in this one  though I didn't find her  other roles that memorable.  Daniel Day-Lewis  allegedly suffered a nervous breakdown after making this film, although you  can't tell from his stolidly understated performance.This is a deep  film, and not just because somebody compared Brezhnev to Oedipus Rex.  Charges of &quot;shallowness&quot; really say more about the viewer than  the film.  It does not wear its depth on its sleeves and does not pound its  &quot;message&quot; into you with a 2X4.  But it lingers in the back of  your mind and makes you think twice at the odd moment.Finally, labels  such as &quot;pseudo-intellectual&quot; shouldn't be chugged around like a  grenade.

Here in this movie, General Gogul has James Bond and  Anya Amasova working together to recover the microfilm.

No more would film makers depict war as an opportunity for John Wayne types to be heroes in an environment where blood was never seen and death was quick, non graphic and usually off camera.With Saving Private Ryan, director Spielberg sets out to take the depiction of the horrors of war to new heights. The opening section showing the first bloody minutes of the Normandy landings in 1945 must be the most blood drippingly violent sequence in mainstream cinema. It is also, by repute, the most accurate depiction of the landings ever on the screen.The explicit violence and special effects are wrapped around a plot that would have done John Wayne proud in the pre Vietnam era. Three brothers, serving in different parts of the world are coincidentally killed at the same time. The fourth brother, Private James Ryan (Matt Damon) is lost somewhere behind enemy lines in France in the immediate aftermath of the Normandy landings. Captain John H. Miller (Tom Hanks)  is sent, with a small group of men to find Ryan and bring him out of France so that he may be sent home.Don't expect the plot to bring you any surprises or any real suspense. Don't expect to be moved by memorable acting. It's not that kind of film. The cast are competent and the script is slick but the film really stands on its special effects, action and pace. These are all spot on, it was these aspects of the film that won Oscars and they combine to produce a film that is well worth watching.It's not for the squeamish and its concentration on effects and action mean that the character building necessary to carry any real message just does not happen.

41067,"I really thought (as is so often the case) that the content added by the director's cut really makes this a much better movie. Ideas which one had  to guess at are explained or can be inferred from the extra footage. Too  bad the idiot American editors out there can't figure out that much of the  audiences they are trying to &quot;protect&quot; are probably far more  discerning then they are. (i.e. stop trying to help us!)  The audio  track commentary from the producer/director cast was great too. It provided  interesting insights and thoughts behind things. They also discuss many of  the differences between the American and the Eurpoean(=Director's) cut. One  example I got a kick out of: originally they wanted the pro wrestling scene  to be Ice Hockey -- they were trying to portray that modern society is  still violent. Get this - the hockey association (no, I don't remember the  name, I'm not a fan) wouldn't allow it. They didn't want to be portrayed as  a VIOLENT SPORT! Gee, I guess all those fights are really hugs where  someone slipped...  Anyway, to me, often the behind the scenes  commentary and extra features like this are really BIG bonuses one gets  with the DVD versions, which can enrich the thoughtful viewer's expeience  of the film -- and these seem to be often overlooked.  So all things  considered, a very nice value for under ten bucks, and a great story for  certain.A thought on the commonly cited audio/video  &quot;quality&quot; problems:  I just have a &quot;normal&quot; TV with  coaxial input. On this 19&quot; TV (fed  from the standard audio/video out  through an RF modulator), the video and audio seems as good or better than  a VHS videotape. I wonder if this is a big part of the problem with the  wide discrepency reported in the quality in the reviews - the final viewing  &quot;hardware setup&quot;. So, just a thought, maybe a direct TV hookup  will make this DVD more enjoyable, masking some of the  &quot;blemishes&quot;? Might be worth trying for the disappointed fans.

If one wants to know what's beneath the psychedelic surface of  F&amp;L, however, Where the Buffalo Roam is the place to look.The film  is impeccably well acted, directed, and written, and it captures the  wierdness of the Gonzo lifestyle fairly well. It takes place in those years  between the freedom of the sixties and the greed of the eigties; those  years Dr. Thompson calls &quot;the Nixon Years,&quot; a time where people  stopped asking questions and discovered apathy, a time where the creative  and free individuals among us had to go underground, turn wierd, or sell  out to survive.It is the way in which this film tells the story of this  era and the accuracy of it's portrayal of the Gozo way of life(thanks to an  amazing performance by Bill Murray and Peter Sellers) that makes it  entertaining, but it is the way in which the film captures the deadly air  of seriousness that hung over all the bizzare trials and tirbulations that  makes it great.Where the Buffalo Roam is one of those rare movies that  cuts out all the BS and tells it like it is.Anyone who knows Hunter S.

First of all it has an all-star cast in which everyone is beautifully casted.  This is a true story about one of the greatest prison camp escapes (WWII) of all times.  It is dedicated to the &quot;fifty&quot; who escaped from this camp.  The movie moves at a good pace, definitely not slow, and each scene holds the audiences attention.  James Garner as Hendley (the scrounger) and Steve McQueen as Virgil Hilts (the cooler king), make things light with their subtle levity.

485422,"The audiences of Shakespeare's time didn't just enjoy his plays.  Theyalso were rather partial to cock-fighting, brutal bare-knuckle boxing-- and public whippings, pillories, hangings, beheadings, andburnings.  Large crowds turned out (with picnic lunches) to enjoy theaverage public execution.Shakespeare was no fool; trying to buildup his career he had to write some shock-schlock to appeal to thepeople who these days like to slow down and take a good, long, lovinglook at major car accidents.Unfortunately, Taymor has quiteauthentically crafted a _Titus_ that appeals to that same regrettabletaste.  There's some good acting (notably the Moorish villain,beautifully played!) but the appalling violence is the star of theshow -- this is just &quot;Nightmare on Elm Street&quot; in fancydress and with more melodious dialogue.Of all Shakespeare's playsthis is perhaps the one best adaptible to our current nadir incinematic and dramatic values. Redemption there is none; Taymor had towrite in a kitschy, wordless end-sequence to spread a little positiveicing onto the relentless despair of the script. Taymor in herobligatory interview congratulates audiences of the early 21st centuryon their ability to find humour in violence and brutality.  I am notinclined to congratulation; barbarism doesn't become more attractivejust because it's contemporary.  If contemporary audiences findmurder, rape, cannibalism and insanity amusing, then I suggest we needlook no further for reasons for most of our social ills.Brutalityand psychotic selfishness have been fashionable in American culturefor a couple of decades now, and somehow we are all wailing andtut-tutting about the inevitable consequences (like Littleton) yetpatting ourselves on the back for our &quot;sophistication&quot; andour admiration for evil.  We can't have it both ways. When we admireand vicariously snigger at evil, we teach our kids what to admire andhow to be.  When they learn what we teach them, we have no one toblame but ourselves.There is some fine location filming here, somederivative but pleasing surrealism (mostly cribbed from Fellini andhis followers), and of course Hopkins is always worth watching (thesole reason I bothered with the film, actually).  What was tedious andat times quite appalling was the &quot;see how shocking we canbe&quot; self-conscious nastiness of the directing.I'm not sayingit's inauthentic; updated, yes, but I think true to the same spiritthat led our beloved William to spill fake blood and dismemberedbodies all over the stage for his finale.The question that troublesme is, how much farther is there to go in the shock/schlock genre?Personally I am not only bored by now, I'm more disgusted (not less)with each insult to my intelligence, each director who thinks the onlyway to entertain me is to show me a newer and fancier car wreck, amore protracted hanging, a heretic screaming more loudly in theflames.  At what point do we decide that perhaps human misery andsuffering are not all that entertaining after all?Or shall we justkiss off the idea of a civil and democratic society, open up a fewarenas, and start selling tickets for the new gladiatorial games?  Arewe all that far from doing so now?  This latest &quot;Titus&quot;makes me wonder.",N/A
258173,"I tend to shy away from WWII movies made from the 40's till the early 60's, because they lack a certain realism.  This film is one of the first, however, to break out of that ultra-patriotic, propaganda ridden era that  Hollywood defined as World War II.  Within the censorship limits of the  time, this movie shows warfare at it's ugliest.  The film follows a squad  from the 95th Infantry Division as they face the Siegfried Line in the fall  of 1944.  The filmakers have researched the technical aspects of the film  fairly well.  The G.I.s are correctly uniformed and equiped, which is  somewhat of a rarity from Hollywood at the time.  ( Unfortunatly the  Germans in the film are not so lucky. They could have used a better tech  advisor.)  Overall a good movie.  Someone must have gained inspiration from  it when they made the movie WHEN TRUMPETS FADE in 1998.  Very similar story  line and just as well done.",Hell Is for Heroes VHS

155654,"Almost every reviewer, and many buyers, are compelled to compare Branagh's HENRY V with Olivier's 1944 masterpiece.  Give Olivier the win for imagination (starting the film onstage, and slowly moving to a more panoramic atmosphere) and for the battle scenes (Olivier's opening sequence of the French horses coming to a gallop across the fields, followed by the incredible black cloud of arrows into the French ranks is far more visceral than anything Branagh put together).  But in every other aspect, Branagh beats Olivier hands down.  His cast is uniformly superb (Derek Jacobi's Chorus is far more compelling than the bland Leslie Banks, while Ian Holm gets far more out of Captain Fluellan than Olivier's actor).  Although both directors were stage veterans who cast their film with stage actors, it's Branagh's cast that takes the honors, and makes the play's language real and human, while Olivier's actors tend to remain in the reverence-for-the-Bard syndrome that undermines so many filmed versions of Shakespeare.It IS a shame that there are no extras on this DVD (Criterion's HENRY V has lots of fascinating extras), but until a more thorough version of Branagh's first film comes along (and surely it will -- it's a modern masterpiece), this is definitely THE HENRY V to own.

429791,"The first film was an eye-opener as far as the transition from comics to big screen was concerned. Being a true take on the then new Dark Knight series of comics that treated its readers to a more mature and brooding Batman, giving them strong, well thought out stories with a more adult theme.  This was (in my opinion) due to the influence of the up and coming Manga trend surfacing in the west with the hugely popular Akira film.  Burton and Keaton created, on the screen, a Dark hero for the 90's that the fans of the comics could relate to and it worked BIG time marrying stark visuals with a music score as rich as you could fit on any film. For a home cinema owner there is little better out there to show off your systems capability than with than this film.  As with most sequels the second, Batman Returns, was less than the original, in this case suffering from too many characters/stars all demanding a piece of the screen time, why on earth the studios think that more is better is beyond me. Quality is ALWAYS better than quantity in a film as born out in many sequels vs. originals. That is not to say that this was a poor film, far from it, just not as good as the first. There were too many character origins to make the main plot anything other than passable.  Now, onto the third in the series. A new director will always bring with them a new vision of a character and story and Schumacher is no different, I believe another reviewer had the same thoughts as me on this one 'The Dark Knight in Technicolor'. For fans of the first two films this had to be a bit of a shock, new Batman and a real glossy comic book feel to the film. This was good escapism but lacked the mature approach of the first two films.  Oh dear, with the final outing, Batman Forever, we see where Schumacher got his inspiration, not from the comics, not from the first films, oh no, anyone remember the campy, hammy Batman TV series with Burt Ward I believe?? Yup the only thing missing from this film were tights and the visual sound affects. POW BASH KA-BLAMMY.  I strongly feel that the stars were wasted on this film, which is a great pity as there is far more potential to this series than has been shown thus far.  In summery, the first two films are ideal teen upward viewing, the second two are in my opinion squarely aimed at kids. A good all round family package I guess.",The Batman Legacy Four Film Giftset  VHS
408334,"This is one of those films where words of praise seem to be almost always inadequate.  I think LONE STAR may turn out to be a classic.  It is certainly one of the best films Sayles has yet given us.  The story is richly textured and wonderfully complex in it's characters, it's social  themes and it's who-done-it mystery.This film covers a potpourri of  subjects: racial strife, national identity, interfamily relationships,  political corruption and political correctness, among others.  That Sayles  is able to contain all these tumultuous matters in one film and make them  work naturally within the structure of that film is nothing short of  miraculuous.The performances are uniformly excellent, with Chris Cooper  and Elizabeth Pena standouts as former high school sweethearts who were  torn apart by their parents. The reason for their separation is not what it  at first seems to be and it is one of the &quot;kickers&quot; of this  movie.  Francis McDormand is featured as Cooper's bipolar ex-wife in a  wonderful cameo.  McConaughey is fine in flashbacks as Cooper's legendary  lawman father.  Kristofferson is all snake venom as a corrupt and murderous  sheriff. Joe Morton is properly reserved as the commander of a local  military installation, a man who has worked his way up in a formally  structured institution, coming to terms with his estranged father, a former  numbers runner and gambler who is now the owner of the only local bar that  caters to the Afican American community.This film is gorgeously shot in  Super 35 by Stuart Dryburgh, who has captured the modern American Southwest  in a way that few other cinematographers have.

399251,"Even though the 50's had its share of big-budgeted, all-star cast productions (""The Ten Commandments,"" ""Giant,"" and ""Around the World in 80  Days,"" to cite just three), it was not until the 1960's that Hollywood  brought out its ""big guns"" to do battle with that fledging upstart,  television.  The decade had its share of hits (""Ben-Hur,"" ""The Longest  Day,"" ""How the West Was Won"" and ""Spartacus""), monumental financial  disasters (""Cleopatra"" ""Mutiny on the Bounty"" and ""The Great Race""),  Biblical opuses (""King of Kings"" and ""The Greatest Story Ever Told""), and  outlandishly weird productions (""It's a Mad, Mad, Mad, Mad World"" and  ""Casino Royale"").""Hawaii"" is one of the last of these and remains one of  the best.  The film boasts great performances from Max Von Sydow as  overzealous Rev. Abner Hale who is obsessed with transforming the  ""heathens"" of the islands to Christianity.  So determined is he in his  efforts that he arrogantly condemns the lifestyle that had been in  existence for hundreds of years in the area.Julie Andrews is wonderfully  strong as Sydow's wife Jerusha.  Although there are times when her  subservience to her mate is a little too much to take, there are moments of  strength her character shows when confronting her spouse about his actions.Manu Tupou is brilliant as Keoki, a native Hawaiian torn between his  desire for Christian priesthood and his faithfulness to the customs of his  people.Richard Harris, although briefly utilized in the effort, is good  as Rafer Hoxworth, Jerusha's former love, who still carries a strong torch  for Mrs. Hale.Rising stars Gene Hackman and Carroll O'Conner round out  the great cast.The real acting ""find"" is Jocelyne LaGarde, a first-time  performer who shines in her role of Queen Malama.  Whenever she is on  screen, her imposing physical presence is balanced by her very emotive face  and vocal intonation.  A deserving Academy Award nomination was given to  the actress.Elmer Bernstein composed a score befitting the expanse of  the story and the grandeur of the islands.The film does have its  drawbacks.  Both Von Sydow and Andrews are significantly older than their  characters' ages at the start of the film.  The then-acceptable showing of  the bare breasts of non-white females shows how prejudicial Hollywood was  at the time.However, the overall production shows how ""primitive""  peoples of the world have fallen as a result of the ""advancement"" of  Christianity.  The movie may have glossed over the subject in a way that  only Hollywood could, but it still is a rousing good entertainment.",Hawaii VHS

(and &quot;Christian Sands&quot; is one of my faves, too...)Another  movie I'm split on, but in this case I know why: while Nicholas Cage shone  in this film in a way I've never seen before, John Travolta couldn't hold  up his end of it at all.Cage was brilliant. Best I've ever seen him  do. Bounces from complete fanatic to distraught cop with no problems at  all, and plays both roles so convincingly you can actually believe they  could suck a face off person A and deposit it on person B. On the other  hand, Cage walked into Travolta's role halfway through this film, with  Travolta having set him up badly. And that was the role Travolta played  _well_. I don't know why he was so off here, but he just wasn't up to  snuff, especially after the switch. He just didn't work as a psycho (odd,  considering he worked so well as an antisocial murderer in Pulp Fiction).  Go figger.So ultimately, the movie has to stand or fall on the  ensemble cast, since Travolta's given it two strikes. And it stands.  Alessandro Nivola, especially, is wonderful as Nicholas Cage's brainy,  sociopathic brother, and Nick Cassavetes makes a fine, fine bad guy. Add in  the patented John Woo action sequences, and this becomes a couple of hours  of good escapist fluff, if you can get past John Travolta as Mr. Wooden  Personality.",N/A

480212,"I guess everyone has to start somewhere.  This 1990 film, released direct to video in 1993, and re-released this year, harkens back to the beginning of Sandra Bullock's film career when she was probably thrilled to get a B  movie script.  Actually, to call this a B movie would be the kindest of  prevarications.  It was nowhere near that good.  A mediocre plot was marred  by dreadful directing, wretched cinematography and awful acting.The film  starts out like a recruiting film for the protest arm of the Sierra Club,  with people locked in human chains to keep loggers from cutting down the  rainforest.  The leader is assassinated and then our heroine (Sandra  Bullock), teams up with a whacked out photo journalist (Craig Sheffer) to  find the killer and expose corruption.  At this point it tries to convert  to an action adventure thriller in the jungles of the Amazon.It  fails.There are so many things to criticize in this film, I hardly know  where to begin.  Let's try cinematography.  The color quality was awful,  scenes were constantly out of focus and the lighting was poor.  We had  overexposures, and underexposures with no regard to effect.  How about  audio? The sound was muddy, the music was poor.  And acting?  The acting  was amateurish, bumbling and shrill.Directing?  Luis Llosa must have  been on a tight budget.  It seems like he did the whole film in one take.  Actors were flubbing lines all over the place, but the cameras kept  rolling.Okay, but what about Sandra?  She was a raw talent at this point  (in more ways than one).  This film provides us with her one and only nude  scene, which may be its only claim to fame.  But don't rush to the movie  store to rent it because of this.  Though it is clear she is fully unclad,  you really see nothing, which is probably a blessing.  I love Sandra  Bullock, but let's face it, she has a body only Popeye could love, and adds  nothing to a film by appearing in the buff.  Actually, her acting here  showed promise, especially in one scene where she is trying to revive a  child just rescued from a fire.

While certain things simply cannot be adapted (they are too abstract to be visually  substantiated), the atmosphere and general aura weren't very different.  They both deepen the effect of the other, a clear sign that Anthony  Minghella wrote a superbly adapted screenplay.  As for the  cinematography--much of the film's fluidity owes to its brilliance and its  visual metaphors. Ralph Fiennes makes it impossible for us to imagine  anyone else in the role--he takes us through the narrative with wounded  pathos and real charisma--and Kristin Scott Thomas is luminous (a shop-worn  word, I see)in a difficult role.  She plays a woman who is terribly open  with nothing to hide (except for the affair, of course), and while other  actresses may fall into the pit of being bland with such a seemingly  one-dimensional character, Scott Thomas adds countless layers and nuances.  Fiennes and Scott Thomas  make the characters real people with real  feelings.  All other actors, especially  Willem Dafoe (he nearly steals the  movie), are superb and felt.

206094,"Good Grade B spook spectacular that combines two classic horror characters  of Universal Studio.  A resurrected Wolfman, Larry Talbot (Lon Chaney,  Jr.), seeks release from his cursed life.  Maleva, the old gypsy woman,  suggests he consult the infamous Dr. Frankenstein.  In Vasaria, Talbot  discovers the Frankenstein monster within the ruins of the defunct  mad-doctor's gloomy castle.  The complicated plot involves Frankenstein's  human granddaughter (Ilona Massey), a psychiatrist named Dr. Mannering  (Patrick Knowles), and the usual irate villagers.  Mannering evolves into a  low-key version of the mad-doctor.  After poring over Frankenstein's  records describing &quot;the secrets of life and death,&quot; Mannering  decides to drain the energy forces from both Talbot and the monster.  The  two title characters find themselves strapped to tables in the laboratory  on a night of metamorphosis and terror.  Dr. Mannering has the urge to  crank the monster up to its full strength before undoing Frankenstein's  creation.  When the full moon shines in the lab window, all hell breaks  loose in explosive fashion as the super-charged monster and the Wolfman  tear into each other.Although Bela Lugosi had previously declined the  role, he plays Frankenstein's monster.  By this stage of his career, Lugosi  suffered from advancing age and other physical ailments that no doubt  contributed to his uninspired performance.  The monster is relegated to a  secondary role, and spends his time hanging around the ruins.  Instead of  terrorizing the countryside, he watches Talbot pace and fume.  The movie  works better as a &quot;Wolfman&quot; story.  The opening segment of the  two grave robbers that desecrate the Talbot crypt is one of the scariest  scenes in all of Universal's horror flicks.  Chaney's  &quot;man-into-werewolf&quot; transformation is the stuff of troubled  dreams, enhanced by Jack Pierce's classic makeup.  After the action shifts  to Vasaria, a young woman is brutally murdered, and the bewildered  villagers question what animal kills that savagely? On cue, something howls  in distance.  Classic horror fans will recognize Dwight Frye as one of the  respectable villagers.  This is an inside joke because the character actor  previously appeared as the hunchbacked dwarf in the original  &quot;Frankenstein,&quot; and played an insane procurer of  &quot;fresh&quot; dead bodies in &quot;Bride of Frankenstein.&quot;  Maria  Ouspenskaya returns as the enigmatic Maleva.

The film is a spectacularly successful blend of action, emotion, music, and mythic imagery.Although the film is intended towards a family audience--two of the main characters are children, and graphic scenes of human carnage are avoided--there is plenty in here for adult fans of the genre to enjoy. The film is full of stunningly beautiful images that are charged with the power of myth and the elegance of poetry. The opening sequence, for example, sends chills down my spine. And the fight sequences rival a heavyweight boxing match in intensity.The human actors give fine performances, but the real stars, of course, are the fantastic creatures. The special effects team has done a miraculous job of truly bringing these creatures to life. Mothra, her gargantuan larval offspring, the miniature &quot;fairy Mothra,&quot; and the other creatures are fully developed characters who really engage the viewers' emotions. Toshiyuki Watanabe's stirring score is a powerful complement to the epic drama of creation, destruction, and metamorphosis which is enacted by these mythic creatures.As I noted before, this is a film for all ages. After falling in love with it, I watched the video with my four year old nephew. I don't think I've ever seen a child get so emotionally involved in a film before; he insisted on borrowing the tape and watching it over and over!Like many film lovers, I am wary of remakes and retreads of the classic films which I loved as a child.

But fear not, classic Mothra fans: Toho company has produced a new classic which remains true to the spirit of the original while adding to the Mothra mythos. This film is essential viewing for giant monster fans.",N/A
38544,"This film seems to cover all of the bases-fast-paced action, peerless performances, and hysterical dialogue (but a warning, they are all saturated with the vernacular of stressed-out, potty-mouthed stock  brokers). Although some reviews have said the script is convoluted and  lacks direction, I entirely disagree. The script contains scenes that  reveal the many dilemmas that plague Seth (Giovanni Ribisi) - his struggle  to gain the approval of his inhibited father, a federal judge; his fight to  live with himself; and his need for redemption. It is obvious that it is  quite difficult to find films that are so tightly and expertly woven these  days, but overlooked films like `The Boiler Room' confirm that there are  still writers and directors out there who know how to do their job  competently.Ben Affleck has a memorable cameo as the guy who motivates  the young brokers-to-be. Vin Diesel's role is small but he most definitely  makes the most of all of his scenes. Nia Long plays Abby, whose role (if I  must nitpick) I felt could have been developed a bit more and contained  more connecting scenes with  Seth. The kudos really goes to Giovanni  Ribisi, who is proving that he is fast becoming one of Hollywood's hottest  and most talented stars. Enigmatic in appearance and disquieting in  demeanor, he takes command of every scene and delivers his lines with  emotion and bite. I cannot think of another actor who could play the role  of Seth as well as he did. His performance in the role of a young man  struggling to come to terms with himself keeps you nailed to your seat for  the entire duration of the film.The rap music and slightly annoying  cinematography chiefly in the beginning of the film can be easily forgotten  once all the primary elements are established. Don't miss this film!",N/A
396386,"Birth of a Nation is the quintessential masterpiece that puts D.W. Griffith in his place in American history as the true genius behind filmmaking as an art form.  Birth of a Nation is an astonishing film which  carries Griffith's heart-felt messages about trust, national pride, and  racial tension, which hold up pretty well even  85 years after the fact.  Nothing has so effectively symbolized a country torn apart by racism and  hate so well as Birth of a Nation.Birth of a Nation always has  received lots of negative press for its portrayal of the Ku Klux Klan.  Many claim the film exists as merely racist propaganda against blacks.  In  fact, Griffith was not a racist and directed the whole film as a view of  the Civil War from the Southern perspective.  Griffith, not-so-ironically,  followed this film up with the equally mesmerizing, yet critically panned  epic Intolerance.Birth of a Nation deserves to be brought on DVD, as  video tape just doesn't do justice to this scratchy silent classic.",N/A

457390,"Usually I enjoy high school hijinks movies, but this one was vapid.  The story revolves around five girls at an all girls prep school, four of whom have the IQ's of one of Tiger Woods' better rounds of golf.  As usual in  these movies, we are treated to the escapades and mischief cooked up by  bored teens, this time female style.  Unfortunately, most of the skits were  woefully unfunny and stereotyped.As the movie progresses, we learn  that, out of financial need, the school intends to merge with a local boys'  school and go coed.  The girls try to sabotage the plan with a plot at the  next mixer to make the boys look like drunks and perverts.  When that  fails, the film starts taking itself very seriously and the girls organize  a student strike and lock themselves in the dorm demanding the right to  vote against the merger.The direction of this film by writer/director  Sarah Kernochan was uninspiring.  Other than some decent sixties props it  was pretty insipid.  Kernochan made a splash as the co-writer of `9   Weeks' and `Sommersby', but as a solo writer/director she just doesn't cut  it.The acting; well, there really wasn't any acting.  Other than Lynn  Redgrave, who was far too melodramatic for this film, all we had here was a  bunch of pubescent teens behaving sillily.  The only serious teenage  character in the film was Odette (Gaby Hoffman) and she was far too dour  and condescending.This movie is pretty much a disaster.  It had a couple  of funny moments but they were far too sparse.  I gave it a 3/10.  I would  only recommend it to girls 10 to 18 years old, or to anyone else who needs  a 90 minute nap.",All I Wanna Do VHS

Leatherface is back again wielding the chainy chainsaw and going bonkers! The film is praised and bashed by many, but its an entertaining horror film.

Anyway...The packaging, remastering, and inclusions of the theatrical trailers were all great, granted, but this is not all of Hitchcock's best work. Alfred  Hitchcock is my favorite director, and I was shocked to see all the great  movies that were omitted (REAR WINDOW, NORTH BY NORTHWEST, THE 39 STEPS,  NOTORIOUS, STRANGERS ON A TRAIN, REBECCA, and THE LADY VANISHES) that are  much better than many of these mostly mediocre movies (TORN CURTAIN, TOPAZ,  THE TROUBLE WITH HARRY, THE MAN WHO KNEW TOO MUCH, and ROPE).

Another twenty something female teamed with an  over forty something male would have been would have been too predictable  and boring. The psychological undertone which ran through out the movie,  was the issue of trust.

227204,"ROMANCING THE STONE could be seen as the poor man's Indiana Jones movie. It's short on snappy dialogue, coherent plot and memorable characters.Essentially this is a vehicle for Douglas as rough and ready  Jack Colton, and Turner to show her versatility as Joan Wilder, the  novelist who sheds her loner image and eventually becomes a heroine. Danny  DeVito crops up as a slimy rival to the duo's quest, but his part is  overplayed and underwritten.The story as it is revolves around Wilder  going to Columbia to rescue her kidnapped sister. This leads her into a  journey of adventure to recover a fabled jewel with adventurer Colton. An  almost sinister kidnapping becomes a farcical adventure comedy: I found the  switching in tone of this movie at times confusing, and at other times far  too blunt.Whilst ROMANCING THE STONE is not a movie that will leave any  lasting impression on you, it is passable as entertainment - saved as it is  by the one thing that causes it so many problems: the reliance on the  Turner-Douglas on-screen relationship to carry it through.",Romancing the Stone VHS

Great work by a number of veteran character actors (most notably, Sam  Jaffee and James Whitmore) and a dynamite lead performance by Sterling  Hayden as a man of simple needs who just wants to get enough money to  retire to the farm where he was raised.

I had seen, i'm sure like most others who found this  movie, as a preview before a rented movie and the only reason i got it was  because of the talking cat , which i thought looked hilarious, and also the  fact that U2 was in it seemed to give it some credibility, even though i  knew in the back of my head that Stephen Dorff isn't the greatest actor.  Phil Joanou (director of the film...i think that's how you spell it) should  stick to music videos because he defintely has a knack for cool shots, and  visuals (the reason i gave this two stars), but unfortunately forgot that  no matter how much style and flash you put on, its a good story that sells  a movie, not visual effects.

John Coffey is, at the same time, Jesus Christ (&quot;J.C.&quot; converting Hanks' &quot;Paul&quot; along the &quot;mile&quot;), Steinbeck's Lenny  (&quot;Of Mice and Men&quot;), and Uncle Tom. The result, apparently by  accident, is an oddly offensive racial stereotype:  a huge, black man  accused of raping 2 white children [the stereotypical white fear of  &quot;the black man&quot;] who at first intimidates the white prison  guards, but soon captures their hearts (and those of the audience) by being  scared of the dark, mentally imbecilic, and living only to &quot;help&quot;  the white folk and &quot;the bossman.&quot;  I think of myself as hating  the whole P.C. nonsense, but I really think anyone who fell in love with  this story must ask themselves why they are attracted to a self-sacrificing  Christ figure who just happens to represent the wishes and fears of the  white representation of the black man.  Were I black, I'd at least want to  be treated as a Christ figure for what I am and have sacrificed, and not  what white culture has so often stereotyped me as:  the noble savage.Add  to this an unnecessary hour of easily cut scenes, two dimensional  characters [played by brilliant actors, admittedly], and a highly offensive  -- not to say illogical and unnecessary-- moral decision by  &quot;Paul&quot; at the end, and you have just what you'd expect when  Stephen King tries to do Shakespeare meets New Testament meets Walt Disney.",N/A

Peter Sellers gives the performance of a lifetime as Chance the gardener, a low-key performance that is essential to the film's purpose,  and Sellers doesn't fumble for a second. Also with an excellent supporting  cast, Shirley MacLaine and Jack Warden are excellent but Melvyn Douglas is  the one who delivers an excellent performance as the millionaire who takes  Chance in and presents him to the most powerful people in the country. The  film starts out as Chance's employer dies, the film insinuates but never  really affirms that he might be his father, it also tries to insinuate that  he might be God, by making him walk on water near the end. Then he meets  Shirley MacLaine by chance and his bumbling gardening ignorance is  misinterpreted as quiet wisdom and he is soon influencing the most powerful  people in the country, to the point where he is considered to be a  presidential candidate. The plot itself is a satire on the modern media and  the effect of constant bombardment of television and radio.

It is beyond any doubt the worst looking film in my DVD collection at this moment.  I even have a Madacy DVD  which looks better than this!  Where to begin....the picture quality is  extremely blocky, I see compression artifacts left and right and up and  down.  The grain of the film is too prominent.  On and on...bottom line: I  think the VHS version of a non-director's cut of Highlander looks better  than this DVD.  And the sound!  Groan.  Sometimes I could barely hear the  dialogue which sounds thin and reedy, and in the next scene the sound  effects come blaring out the speakers.  The sound quality is very uneven;  it almost seems like the producers of this DVD took a monophonic soundtrack  and attempted to make it into 5.1.  Who knows?  As for the extras...HAH!  It is totally disorganized, almost as if someone took a stack of  papers/photos off the desk, scanned them randomly into a computer and  transfered them onto the DVD.  Furthermore, the photo gallery repeats a lot  of the photos (duh) and zips right by at 24 photos a second (duh).  By the  time you realize it, probably 200 pages have gone by before you can hit the  pause button.So, is there anything to like about this DVD?  Well, it  does show the uncut widescreen version of Highlander as seen in Europe, so  Americans may see a few extra enlightening scenes.  There is a commentary  by the makers of the film, which is of some interest (and which I found to  be more listenable than the actual &quot;THX-certifed&quot; soundtrack).  And the price is quite affordable.

Though lacking in any new creativity or innovation, Scream 2 is still an  excellent slasher film that continues Scream's homage and paroding of  horror movie cliches and patterns. Beginning with a clever opening sequence  thats about as provocative as Drew Barrymore's death in 1, Scream 2 settles  down and composes a jazzy, uneasy, and edgy story that builds upon audience  awareness of Scream's story to create a more fullfilling storytelling style  than Scream Though weakened by an overly dramatic and inferior conclusion,  Scream 2 is still a much better sequal than I could have possiably hoped  for.

453983,"This film is not available in wide screen. Why? Because wide screen technology was not available in Russia in 1927, therefore it is unable to be translated to this current DVD (we are all becoming so spoiled by this wide screen thing!). What was available was academy format, which, while having a significantly narrower ratio than wide screen, served to get the job done. I think it is amazing that a piece of film shot 75 years ago has survived into the next century, mostly intact, for us to watch and analyze while all around us bright shiny new pieces of wide screen film seem hardly worth the effort. I digress... Now, this particular offering of Eisentien also features a bit of history some film majors and industry people (because really, who else knows about this? Sad but true..) may not know. The storming of the winter palace DOES take place within the winter palace. Why is this strange? Because a lot of the props in the movie, and the sets themselves were either rescued from destruction or pilfering by Stalin, just so Sergei could benefit from a wealth of ""accurate"" material to move his camera through and over. Therefore this film is known for having an ""accurate"" portrayal of what the winter palace, sans about 75% of it's original glory (and inhabitants), appeared like during czarist Russia. Neat huh? Now as for the historic validity of ""October"".....no. Sorry. This is a propaganda film, and one of the world's finest by far, but this is most definitely, without exception, Stalin's view of the ""glorious"" revolution as portrayed by Sergei Eisenstien. Did Sergei support the revolution? If he wanted to get a film made he sure did, and Stalin could be counted on to be Sergei's WORST critic if something did not agree with Stalin's personal ""version of history"". I like Eisenstein.

432801,"At the very beginning of Halloween, A young child murders his older sister.And so begins the thrilling tale of &quot;Halloween&quot;, a flat out horror classic and one of my personal favorite films. Many people consider this to be one of the greatest horror films ever made, and it deserves the distinction.The story tells the disturbing tale of Micheal Myers, who, at the tender age of eight, downed a clown outfit and killed his sister with a butcher knife. Years later, he returns to his birthplace and terrorizes three teens on the same night he killed his sister: Halloween.Mike Myers is scary with his pale mask and black outfit. The rarity of seeing his face adds a element of mystery to his character, which is what makes him so terrifying. Micheal displays no emotion and never speaks a word. He seems to mock his victims, playing dead and then jumping at them. He never seems to die, as the ending demonstrates. A merciless killer for a merciless horror film.&quot;Halloween&quot; is subtle in terms of blood and gore. We never see any gore or blood. Instead, Carpenter uses camera angles and such to hide the slash marks.  It is, however, suggestivly brutal as demonstrated in scenes in which victims moan in pain as the knife makes contact with their flesh. The worst scene being when Micheal holds up one of his victims with nothing but his knife.While &quot;Psycho&quot; has wonderfully painful tension in its own right, &quot;Halloween&quot; is my preference. &quot;Halloween&quot; has tension equal to the famed shower scene, repeated over and over again in every scene involving an innocent teen and Micheal. During the film, I was wondering if I could bear the suspense. &quot;Halloween&quot; is perhaps the most suspenseful film I have ever seen.How fully appreciate that masterfully high level of suspense, however, one must dedicate themselves fully to Halloween. This is not the kind of film that one watches while doing something completely different, such as exercising or putting away the dishes. It requires your full attention.Both &quot;Psycho&quot; and &quot;Halloween&quot; have terrific musical scores.  But the winner is, in my opinion, &quot;Halloween&quot;. Upon watching the film and listening to the songs, our minds conjure up images of pain, choas, relentless evil, and chaotic terror.I know what your thinking, &quot;That's great, but will I like it?&quot;. Well, I believe the terror spread by &quot;Halloween&quot; will be enjoyed universally, but I offer a opinion of one of my friends. He told me to never see &quot;Halloween&quot;. To quote his words, &quot;It gave me nightmares for four weeks! DO NOT SEE IT!&quot;. I did. I hope you do too.",N/A
164071,"When this film came out in 1992, I was very apprehensive about it, so I avoided seeing it. Last year I decided to give it a chance and finally watch it. This film does the best job of following the events as they take  place in the book of any film adaption of Stoker's story. The film also  keeps the characters straight because the other film versions tended to  eliminate a character altogether (Quincy) or change a character's role (Dr.  Seward). There are some incredible visuals in this film, the beginnig  sequence, the transformation of Dracula into the rats and the chase to the  castle are the ones that really stand out. The costumes, sets and special  effects are overall spectactular.  However, I just cannot overlook the  problems of this film.  I tried to keep in mind the fact that other film  versions of Dracula are far off from the book like Universals and Hammers  versions and I love them, but I keep coming back to the unavoidable fact  that they stuck Stroker's name on the film which insinuates this film will  stick to the book. They did get events right and who the characters were,  but the mood and how the characters behave is where this film fouled out.  Dracula was not a love story, you simply cannot get around that, the final  scene with Mina helping  Dracula off to die just destroys any good the  chase scene did. Stoker's Dracula was a monster, not the suave, hip, tragic  figure that this film tries to portray him as. I normally like Anthony  Hopkins, but his portrayl of Van Helsing was further off than any other  character in this film. Van Helsing was eccentric  to a point, but not a  raving lunatic and that is how Hopkins comes across. I think this was the  Batman approach, in that in Tim Burton's  Batman Michael Keaton played the  title character very low-key and Nicholson (the bigger name actor) played  an in your face type role because he was the bigger name. In Dracula,  Oldman plays a low-key lead character and Hopkins plays a loud, over the  top performance. The problem is Batman was right on target and this film is  way off kilter with the way in which they portrayed these charters. The  overemphasis on sex added nothing to this film, totally unnecessary. This  film hits on a few levels, but the way the characters are portrayed and the  whole mood of the film is just very sub-par. I know a lot people will  disagre with me, but anyone who gave this film five stars is looking at  with a different pair of eyes than I was.",N/A

Well photgraphed, crafted, and cast; everything about this film works well, especially the interaction between Robert DeNiro and Jean Reno.  The car chases are unmatched, as are many of the gun fights.  Callous disregard for innocent bystanders not withstanding, the ""shoot-em"" up sequences hold a degree of realism, from the ordnance selected by the operators, to the much of the weapons handling by the cast.  The scenes under the Alexandre III Bridge and ambush in Nice are outstanding.  The director also make great uses of the French locations, as the photography is superior.

228065,"I remember 'Predator' from many years ago when I was younger and remember enjoying it. Watching it again recently on DVD made me re-examine it. For a  start, there's no plot at all, at least with Alien for example there were  some decent twists. Secondly, the almost 100% male cast hardly say anything  let alone have any decent characterisation. Thirdly, it's quite boring! The  Arnie / Predator fight sequence at the end tends to go on for about a third  of the film!The DVD isn't very hot either - no special features at all  and the picture quality is reasonable to poor (probably from a bad print).  Sound quality is okay, some of the surround effects are good but nothing  stands out.In summary, it's okay - it's a must-have if you're an Arnie  fan but looking back on 'Predator' it's not much of a classic!",N/A

This verison has been updated to take place in the present time, rather than the 50s.For the first 45 minutes I didn't think the filmmakers had understood the theme of the book at all. They were focusing on bitter anti-American talk, rioting in the streets, that sort of thing, whereas the original story is about people meeting the end of their lives--of _all_ lives--with quiet, if somewhat desperately insane, dignity. After the beginning, however, the movie got on track and thereafter did a very good job of drawing one into the characters and their stories.The casting was very good with fine performances all the way around. The story moved along rather slowly and quietly, but with the overlying tension of the end nearing enhancing everything they said and did. Their struggle to grasp any tiny fragment of hope was done well. Updating the 1950's technological scenarios to present technology turned out quite well.The movie is long and I could have done with a bit of tightening here and there, but I could not stop watching it at any point and was quite misted up at the end. They made a strong film and a very credible adaptation of the original book.",N/A

163886,"This movie had a lot going for it - it starred the excellent Gary Oldman  and Anthony Hopkins, was directed by the creator of 'Apocalypse Now' and  generally promised to be a beautiful, engaging movie.  Perhaps  unsurprisingly, it couldn't live up to all this!Allegedly based closely  on Bram Stoker's novel, Coppola actually takes breathtaking liberties with  the story - the original novel never suggests that the Count had any sort  of lost love or that he had any identity other than Dracula.  Coppola  replaces Victorian reserve with overt erotic symbolism - lots of blood, sex  and nudity, in other words.  So he's strayed from the original story (not  unusual these days) and has created a picture where the visuals (which are  very impressive, particularly on this DVD release) are far more important  than the story.The film does have its good points - Oldman makes an  excellent vampire (even though, in his old-Dracula make-up, he reminds me  of Glenn Close), his living-shadow effect is truly chilling, and the  absinth-hallucination scene is great.

255981,"&quot;The Abyss&quot; seems like Cameron's &quot;I'm a Great Director&quot; turn. The trademark Cameron stuff - great stunts, stunning set design and visual effects, appealing characters - is all there, and  much of it works as it should.In particular, the &quot;drowning&quot;  sequence, the fight between the underwater submarines, the trip to the  downed Navy sub, and the visually stunning &quot;trip to the bottom of the  sea&quot; sequence, all work exceptionally well, and are quite  memorable.But other things don't work so well. Witness the preachy,  silly sequence in which the undersea creatures are going to destroy the  world because us silly humans can't get along. Cameron doesn't answer a  simple question: why would they care? Humans are no threat to them, and  quite frankly, any race that threatens genocide against another isn't much  of a race to be admired in my book.And while Cameron is to be admired  for putting so much character development into what is essentially a summer  blockbuster, the characters are actually OVER-developed. The relationship  between Ed Harris' and Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio's characters, for  example, is shown in such painful detail up front that you just KNOW  they'll get back together. Personally, I thought it would have been more  satisfying for them to learn to get along before they fell back in love.  And instead of having Harris and Mastrantonio hook up at the end, why not  have the aliens give us a clue as to why they saved us from  destruction?Overall, &quot;The Abyss&quot; is worth watching for the  brilliant, groundbreaking visuals, but ultimately, the preachy, kissy-kissy  ending and overdeveloped Harris/Mastrantonio relationship really detract  from what could have been a VERY wondrous film experience.Note on the  DVD: because of the excellent sound/picture quality, and all the extras  that come with it, this is a good choice if you're starting your  collection.",N/A

Either way, this movie shows what can be done with a great script and just under 30k dollars.To me, some of the greatest things in the movie are the little errors were people might trip on a word for a second. That's so real, that it give the movie a sense of reality that is missing in so many other movies. People have complained that Randall sounds like he's reading from cue cards. So what! Haven't you ever met anyone like that? I have.Jay and Silent Bob are the kings of loitering. What class they possess. Dante and Randall are a shining example of what can happen to you after working too long in a convience and rental store, respectively.There is nothing far fetched about the story of a guy having a bad day at work. I had many days almost that bad when I did retail. The dialogue is brilliant. Nice little insights about life and your place in it.After hearing a little of the story you forget that the movie is in black and white, and you don't care because it's so good.

What makes this film something a little special is the narration of Orson Welles and the  first-rate production values.The cinematography is nearly flawless.  Very effective use is made of interweaving historical film, often black and  white, with original footage.  Most of the actors used are convincing, and  the scenarios presented are both thought-provoking and chilling.  These  effects are enhanced by a sparce but appropriate soundtrack.The  producers choose to take a very dark approach to the famed prophet's  writings (quatraines, if you prefer).  This morose perspective is balanced  somewhat by the final visions included in the picture.The accuracy of  the interpretations or of the prophecies themselves is problematic, and the  viewer will come to his or her own conclusions.

The picture on the DVD is quite good and sharp most of the time, especially the outdoor-scenes at daytime.

Jason Scott Lee does a great job imitating Bruce's style and mannerisms.  It also accurately showed us the racism involved at the time directed at the Chinese.  Although Bruce Lee was a great man with great ambitions and accomplishments, he wasn't as friendly as the film depicts him to be.  At times Bruce Lee was a bit arrogant and very strong minded and the movie fails to show us that, except when he seemingly temporarily loses his mind argueing with Linda Lee played by Lauren Holly.  Anyway, I love this movie and I love the legend of Bruce Lee, so I reccommend this to any one interested in action movies, Bruce Lee, and inspirational movies.

All in all,  &quot;Phantom Menace&quot; was just a bit weaker than the others.For  example, the characters weren't quirky enough for you to really get to love  them. The two Jedi's were both quite serious, the queen wasn't all that  interesting, and the bad guys really didn't terrify me the same way Darth  Vader could.  There needed to be someone like Han to liven things up  (though I do have to say that Anakin was a strength of this movie).I  know that was supposed to be JarJar's role, but please...I couldn't laugh  at him because he got so annoying by the middle of the movie. Add that to  the fact that it was very difficult to understand him, and one wonders if  Lucas is having any second thoughts about the huge role JarJar  got.However, much so ink has already been spilled about JarJar that I  won't belabor the point.The big battle scene at the end kept reminding  me of the strikingly similar scene in &quot;Jedi.&quot; The feeling of  dejavu was so strong that it left me wondering if the writers could have  made this one a little fresher.All that said, the special effects and  animation was excellent.

It's about lessons learned, about past experiences and how one  chooses to deal with one's past experiences. It makes you think and it  makes you feel something almost indescribable. You can't take the movie for  what it's worth. You have to look deep within the picture, listen deep  between the lines and dialogue and you will know and feel what each  character knows and feels. It's about real people who experienced real  ordeals and found their own way (whether good or bad) to deal with what  they experienced. I am so glad this movie was made. Kudos to P.T. for a  wonderful film that touched me so much. It's (indirect or some may say  direct)reference to the Bible and how the story itself leads to the strange  but plausible ending was most powerful. What more can I say? Wonderful  actors in wonderful performances. A study on human relations. Excellent.  Absolutely excellent.",N/A
137793,"&quot;Some like it hot&quot; is the funniest film of all-time, and the american film institute did a good job at recognizing it, both in their top 100 movies, and funniest film. Tough I think it is worth more than the  fourteenth position in the list of the best american films of all-time, it  still ranks high, so I won,t say a thing. Billy Wilder is something else.  And this comedy is not only funny, but it is overstuffed with great  inventions, and ideas. The movie follows a line through it all, always  respecting it, so that everything that happened in it is there for a  reason. The Dialogue is quick and clever. Though it is famous that it took  hours to Monroe to have a good take, it was worthwile, and never was she  more credible, or sensual. Behind all this sexuality, you know she is a  great actress, worth looking at. Everything coming out of her mouth seems  fresh and new, and as if she means it. but hte fun doesn't stop there.

This movie however has strong performances and a decent script. Kirk Cameron is a lot better than I had expected as Buck. The suspense is there and I think they did a good job of setting up the storyline. I had not read the series prior to the movie and I thought it was very easy to follow. Viewing the film actually inspired me to read all the other Left Behind series books. Though they have their faults, I do believe that future films would be great!

209476,"Since MADIGAN and ESCAPE FROM ALCATRAZ, two movies directed by Donald Siegel, have been presented these last months in the DVD standard, it would be a good occasion to rediscover this director who gave us such  masterpieces as INVASION OF THE BODY SNATCHERS and THE KILLERS.The plot  of ESCAPE FROM ALCATRAZ isn't the most original story on the subject but  contains a certain number of interesting ideas. Firstly, Richard Tuggle,  the screenwriter, and Donald Siegel have chosen to compare Alcatraz to a  zoo and the prisoners to animals trying to escape from their cages. The  leader of the coloured prisoners compares himself to the king of the apes  and the only newspapers permitted in Alcatraz are of the wildlife  documentary kind.So you will be amazed by the number of animals a prison  like Alcatraz can hide in his walls : mouses, cockroaches, rats and birds.  They're all here, in front of Siegel's camera, to make us understand the  condition of the prisoners. OK, it's a little bit heavy, symbolically  speaking, but unusual in this kind of movie.Since the prisoners are  constantly observed, the only way to escape from this prison is to be  present and away in the same time. How ? by imitating the reality with  walls in paper patiently built during the night or by putting mannequins  under their blankets. Another way to escape from Alcatraz is to become mad  . Believe me or not, It's not Clint's choice.As bonus features, you will  only have a scene access (thank you, thank you, thank you). Sound,  surprisingly, is not as good as images.A DVD for the beast in you.",Escape from Alcatraz VHS

Finally, after Ron Howard's wonderful 'Apollo  13', we have this extraordinary series. We get to see the Astronauts, their  families and Nasa management as something other than two-dimensional  history book figures. Myself and many others cannot express our gratitude  enough for the existence of 'From The Earth To The Moon'. The series gives  good coverage of the Gemini program which often tends to be overlooked,  although a portrayal of the remarkable events of Gemini 6 and 7 would have  been welcome. I know that there was only limited running time and budget to  show certain missions. But more details of the near-mutiny of Apollo 7, the  white-knuckle events of Apollo 10 and the problem solving of Apollo 16  could have been important additions to the series. Perhaps one day someone  will make a long-overdue movie or series about Yuri Gagarin and the  eventful Russian space program, Skylab and the Apollo-Soyuz mission. And  one day, someone could tell the tales of the early Shuttle program and the  Challenger tragedy. Manned spaceflight has many tales left to tell.

From a technical point of view, Pitch Black has many original ideas to pull it away from the cheap slasher type. Sometimes it seems kind of  hard to catch up, for it is somewhat bumpy in storytelling but not full of mistakes. The quick cuts to different scenes make the film quite short-wave. Action is always an difficult element and though it's not the quintessence of the movie, it's perfectly realized and even comes up with a few surprises.

Alexandro Jodorowsky (El Topo, the Holy Mountain) and Ridley Scott (Alien, Blade Runner) both tried, but  failed, to make the movie, unable to raise the massive budgets needed.  David Lynch succeeded.  Unfortunately.Lynch's Dune is bedecked with  problems.  It becomes overwhelmed by the sheer volume of information and  the size of the narrative, and Lynch's attempts to overcome these obstacles  are disastrous.  He chooses to do FAR too much exposition and character  thought &quot;out loud,&quot; and the movie feels like a checklist of  important plot events from the novel.  Lynch fails to characterize anyone  but Paul, mistakes Paul for a great hero (instead of a great leader), and  apparently kills all the sandworms.  (Water, especially in the massive  rainfall at the ending, would do that.)  The love story with Chani and  Paul, for instance, is botched into a typical Hollywood auto-love, and  characters like Duncan Idaho and Liet Kynes are introduced, seemingly, just  to put in an appearance.  Paul, and only Paul, is a fairly well-rounded  character here.Read the book.  This movie's not worth your time.",N/A

So many claim Austen's sensibilities for their own that it becomes more interesting to see these interesting ideas.As for me, I like my Austen a little grotty (my favorite Austen-flick being &quot;Persuarsion&quot;), so the grim and disturbing looking characters at Mansfield Park as well as the Price residence are magic. The director's choice to place the story in socio-economic context (wealth earned through slave-powered plantations) as well as the author's gendered/economic context both works and fails.Where the movie lets down is in the underplayed and jerky character development, which seems to be less the fault of the actors and more the result of scripting decisions.

A worthy successor to the aged and abandoned Mrs  Haversham. I just loved her...and pitied her. What a tragic  sight.Director Cuaron transfers his story from the misty and fog bound  moors to the sunny ambience of 1997-Miami. Funnily it works. Ethan Hawke as  Finn the central character and whos acting skills I had serious doubts  about manages to age effortlessly here from inadequate teenager to  confident but lovelorn adult. So maybe the man can act!. Chris Cooper also  does a wonderful portrayal as Joe, Finn's kindly brother-in-law, abandoned  by Finn's faithless sister he captures an image of pathos when he finds  himself out of place at Finns first gallery opening. A first rate actor who  is in no danger of being typecast. In the end Gwyneth carries the movie as  the distantly cold and enigmatic Estelle. She gives new meaning to  aloofness.

Anyone who finds this scene touching will crack their sides at the scene in this movie where Peter Boyle's  monster has the misfortune to encounter Gene Hackman's soup spilling,  cigar-smoking, expresso-drinking blind man.This is no simple parody.  Mel Brooks and Gene Wilder are paying tribute to the old Frankenstein  films. The atmosphere of the original is lovingly recreated and the  charcters and script also reveal an extremely detailed knowledge. It is  obvious that both Brooks and Wilder are big fans of the original movies, as  I am. Mel Brooks's Star Wars parody, Spaceballs, by comparison is pathetic  because there is no real love or familiarity with the original material.Gene Wilder is perfect as the manic Doctor, Peter Boyle impressive as  the monster, but perhaps the two funniest performances are by Marty  Feldmann, whose physiognomy perfectly combines horror and comedy, and  Kenneth Mars as the heel-clicking Inspector Kemp, probably the funniest  German accent ever.I recommend watching the original Frankenstein  movies before this, as this will greatly enhance your enjoyment.",N/A

An action film director, he simply  hasn't the skill to capture one of history's greatest enigmas on film -  even with a large budget and an international cast.  And he is clearly  besotted with Milla Jovovich - else why would he cast her in The Fifth  Element as 'the perfect human?'  She is so out of her depth in this role  that she's embarrassing to watch - turning poor Joan into a complete  neurotic.  The film suggests that the real puzzle of history is not that  Joan of Arc led a French army into battle - and won - but that the Dauphin  and his ministers actually permitted this apparent nut case to do so.  She  obviously hadn't the imagination - neither did Besson - to look deeply into  this young woman's soul and find something authentic - like a 15th-century  peasant girl made so ecstatic by her visions and voices (made ridiculous in  the movie) that she convinced enough of her countrymen that she was sent to  liberate them.  I can think of maybe two or three living actresses who  could pull it off, but they're far too old to play a 19-year-old.

This is a film closely related to the Pygmalion (sp?) story.  I have learned that fact from a teacher at the college I now attend.  I was once like Rita...common, confused, complacent in the ordinary ways of my limited existence, but my intelligence and desire to refine it slowly bubbled to the top.  This movie is an inspiration to anyone who loves to learn, and to anyone who loves to live.  And it's a beautiful depiction of the life we all find as we venture away from our common surroundings into a world filled with geniuses, charlatans, drunks, dreamers, and institutionalized philistines.  I also love the way Dr. Bryant is influenced and inspired by his pupil, Rita....he moves past his mid life crisis with help from a person who is attempting to overcome the urge to have an early one.  Rita's vibrant and positive attitude drives Dr. Bryant to explore his bottomless pit of despair and alcoholism deeper than ever before(he cannot handle the fact that life is leaving him behind).

351033,"Following the death of her mother, a young Chinese-American woman June (Wen), takes her place in the routine game of mahjongg - a tradition maintained by her late mother and her friends, who all came to America  seeking escape from the incredibly harsh life in turbulent China. She  learns what they went through not only there, but what they had to face in  adjusting to life in the U.S. And as each mother has had daughters, so we  also learn how they grew up as first-generation Americans - caught between  two wildly-different cultures, never quite fitting into either. There are  some six stories in all, with a linking subplot. You don't have to have  lived a similar life to enjoy this film, but it's not everyone's cup of  tea, being one of those movies that pulls more than once at your  heartstrings. And at times, it does tend to give the Chinese female  stereotype that you would only get in a Hollywood production.

Starting off in a mafia-controlled seafood restaurant, we find Fletch in drag and the object of desire of a near-sighted Greek man.Inheriting a Louisiana mansion, Fletch flies down next to an obnoxious but friendly nasal-surgery candidate.  Yet another classic dream sequence, and this one is not to be missed, as &quot;Old White Joe&quot;, Fletch fantasizes that his ex-wife's lawyer, his boss and the cute gal from the office all fall at his feet.  The imagery from Disney's &quot;Song of the South&quot; is pure genius and you might notice &quot;Ted Underhill&quot; making a cameo appearance at the end of the dream sequence (there must have been 300 extras here or a *whole* lot of CGI ... check out the *very end* of the dream sequence closely).I love it.  Again beautiful women involved here including the lovely Julianne Phillips.

468413,"Cookie's Fortune is about a murder, the investigation that ensues and the long covert secrets that are revealed. The setting is Mississippi, where everybody knows everybody else, and more often then not, everybody is everybody else's cousin. It's the same place where Gene Hackman and Willem Dafoe once hunted down some inbred racist good ol' boys and the ku kux klan in Alan Parker's Mississippi Burning. Even if a black man is taken in for the murder of his white landlady/friend/confidant (or is she?), Altman's peculiar little slice of some very distinct lives is as far away as you can get from that sensationalist film. For starters, the old lady, Cookie Orcutt (Patricia Neal) has, quiet happily, committed suicide to join her departed husband. There has been no murder. The ""investigation"" involves friendly chats with the local witnesses where the police clerk, a cute wide eyed young woman ponders complex questions in the vein of ""How can I strike Eddie's statement from the record. I'm recording this, not writing it"". Meanwhile, the ""suspect"", the immensely amiable Willis (Charles Dutton) sits in an open cell, playing scrabble with the police chief Lester Boyle, who believes Willis to be innocent because he has ""fished with him"". The suspect's stay is so relaxed that he complains that he may die from the lavish prison food, incidentally cooked by the Police chief's wife, before he gets anywhere near an electric chair.In an Altman film, the setting is almost as important as his numerous characters. In this case, it is Holly Springs, with its staples and archetypes. The camera wonders around town, lazily observing them, slowly revealing the plot, which is obvious and serves only to highlight those archetypes. The story, which, despite a couple of twists near the end is just an excuse to observe this inbred, particular architecture of inter-locking relationships. There is Camille (Glen Close), Cookie's niece who discovers Cookie's body and eats the suicide note because ""no one commits suicide in this family"". This is her contribution to the plot, more important to Altman is the fact that she is a pompous, elitist eccentric who is currently directing a ""revised"" Oscar Wilde's version of Salome for which she shares a writing credit. Her sister, a ravishing moron, Cora(Julianne Moore)is the star who could hypnotize a bull in heat with her ""performance"". Cora's daughter is Emma (Liv Tyler), a free spirit who rejects her family, and is in love with a local doofus cop, Jason Brown (Chris O'Donnell) who in turn is acting her deranged aunt's play. And so goes the circle.The town of course is comically under prepared for a murder investigation. Much of the humor comes from the way these people's child-like reactions to what other more cynical movie characters would react with requisite formality. In truth the film is difficult to classify. Partly a comedy of manners or a gentle farce or a tour of a deep fried utopia even a tale of one man's camaraderie with his town. It has a lightness of touch, that would make those frenzied, desperate young directors jealous. After the useless, Grishamed, plot-driven Gingerbread Man, I think the best classification for this little gem would simply be ""A Robert Altman film"".",Cookie's Fortune VHS
476991,"I would have rated this one three stars, were it not for the acting brilliance of William H. Macy, who is fast becoming a legend in his own time.  He makes an average 'We're No Angels' knockoff above average.  Overall the movie is entertaining, but the female cast was grossly  underutilized.  Each of the scenes containing children, with the exception  of the final, redemptive frame, played out like afterthoughts, thrown in to  provide perfunctory embellishment.  And the joe who played the Texas  Marshall with 'a secret of his own'--didn't he play opposite Linda Hamilton  in the 'Beauty and the Beast' series some years back?

178124,"Spike once said that this is a film about a genius battling his inner demons.  Like every great musician, the one thing he loves most can not love him back, and he can only hope to hold on to it forever.  When he  loses it, he must come to grips with his isolation.  Viewed in that light,  I think Spike did an OK job.  Not great, just OK.I think Spike tried to  hide Bleek's bad side until after he lost his music.  He made Bleek look  like a virtuoso that had it all - talent, success and women.  I think that  as far as the story, Spike overlooked many of the details in character  development that could have made the movie more dramatic and would have  given the viewer more insight into the pain Bleek experienced.  We had to  rely on Denzel's acting (which was excellent) to understand the heartache.  And Spike perhaps spent too much time on Giant's development.  Giant was a  supporting character, but oft times seemed to be the star.  (Was it Spike's  own ego that caused him to do this?)  And I think because of the lack of  character development, Bleek's return to Indigo, albiet emotional and  heartfeeling, was just not truly believable.This is a film with  excellent acting, cinematography, dialogue, music and sound, but the story,  unfortunately, does not hold up to tight scrutiny.

10059,"Look, Van Damme films will never be in a class that I consider good fare.  His stuff is usually thin on plot, full of laughable dialogue, and  fist-thick on martial arts.  Does that mean that I don't watch his stuff?  No it doesn't.  I've watched his movies because there are times that I  don't want to think, just escape, and he provides just that in ""Maximum  Risk"".  Out of his movies that I have seen, this one turned out to be one  of his best, if not the best (but honestly, he doesn't give us a lot to  choose from).""Maximum Risk"" is an extremely violent movie with a very  high body count.  I lost track of the dead early on.  While the plot is as  thin as always (Russian mafia, twin brother, beautiful girl), Ringo Lam  pumps it up with some nifty car chases (if you like that sort of thing) and  provides the viewer with one heck of a ride as we step over the bodies.  This is non-stop action from the get-go, and the fight scenes (yes, there  are many) are hard-hitting and brutal, yet believable (almost a  first).For those that like Van Damme, this movie should be high on your  list.

362493,"There is a very real sense in which Star Trek: The Next Generation stars over with this episode.  After all, we are back to the beginning of the series with Q's sudden arrival.  Q is bored and wants to join the crew.  Picard gives this serious consideration (really, he does) before refusing the offer.  We are then back to first episode with Q again insisting that humanity is not prepared for &quot;what's out there.&quot;  Instead of heading to Farpoint Station, this time the mountain comes to Mohammed, as Q snaps his fingers and transports the Enterprise to the far side of the galaxy where they encounter a Borg cube. Of course, Picard refuses to surrender and spurns Q's offer to join the crew and help.  But that is before Picard's people start dying at the hands of the unstoppable Borg.Very little of the previous forty-one episodes matters to what happens from this point on, except to establish specifics about the characters: Riker does not want to leave the Enterprise (&quot;The Icarus Factor&quot;), Data has a brother android (&quot;Datalore&quot;), Worf is alienated from his Klingon heritage (&quot;Heart of Glory&quot;), Deanna has a mother (&quot;Haven&quot;), Wesley is not yet ready for Starfleet Academy (&quot;Coming of Age&quot;), Tasha died (&quot;Skin of Evil&quot;), Dr. Crusher is gone for this season (&quot;The Child&quot;), Q likes to cause trouble (&quot;Hide and Q&quot;) and Picard likes Dixon Hill novels (&quot;The Big Good-bye&quot;).  Now that the characters are all established, it is as if the producers and writers decided to draft a new mission statement.  After this comes the classic &quot;Best of Both World,&quot; as well as &quot;I Borg&quot; and &quot;Descent.&quot;It is said that it is the quality of the villain that makes or breaks a heroic tale, in which case Next Generation struck pay dirt with the Borg, who are a vast improvement over the Klingons and Romulans.  In the cosmology of the original series those two empires supposedly represented the Soviets and the Chinese (which makes Vulcans the Japanese is you want to keep working out this analogy), but they were not particularly worthy adversaries.  The Borg, as well as the Cardassians, are both vast improvements on their predecessors, perhaps because they do not have 20th century counterparts.  Suddenly the Federation faces an eminently credible threat and the ante is upped considerably.  The Borg are coming and so are the really good episodes of this series.

68329,"This is hardly the movie one would expect from the man who brought us the likes of ""Zena: Warrior Princess"", but it is a pretty good movie. Sam Raimi  (Evil Dead, Evil Dead II, Army of Darkness) directs and Kevin Costner (  Bull Durham, The Bodyguard) stars in this story of an aging baseball star  struggling over the future of his career and his love life.The entire  movie takes place in one afternoon, as Costner stands on the pitchers mound  in the middle of Yankee Stadium. As he pitches in what could be his last  game, he begins to look back on his life in a series of flashbacks. He  begins to remember his often stormy romance with his long time ""on again,  off again"" girlfriend, played by Kelly Preston (Jerry McGuire, Jack Frost).  As the movie plays on we are given little bits of insight as to the events  the have played out between Costner and Preston. While he stands in  reflection of his life, he must pitch against the Bronx Bombers in what is  essentially a meaningless game. But as the game wears on, everyone with the  exception of Costner realizes that he is pitching a perfect game, perhaps  the rarest of pitching achievements. The drama builds at the end when you  begin to wonder if he will indeed finish the perfect game, and if he and  Preston will end up together.Costner does a very good job of playing the  veteran pitcher (he played a veteran catcher in much the same position in  ""Bull Durham"" several years earlier) trying to come to grips with the end  of his career and the possible end of a relationship. Costner is a good fit  in an athletic role, and makes the character believable. I still think all  of his movies spend too much time in a close up of his face, but all things  considered it goes over well. Preston is very likable as his long time  girlfriend, tiring of playing second fiddle to the game, and there are  several strong supporting performances, but the voice of legendary baseball  man Vin Scully brings a feeling of true reality to the film.I am not a  big fan of a movie told almost entirely in flashback, but once I got used  to it, I did enjoy it. It does seem to be a little disjointed at times, but  it makes its point. I liked the plot and the cast, but at times Costner  becomes too philosophical, and I could do without all the up close shots of  Kevin's face. At this point in his career, if people haven't noticed that  he's handsome they never will. That's why I gave it a four.

He worked (still does) in the basement level of our school building.  ...  The same, I feel, can be said of the protagonist, Sweet William.  The story surrounds the utter isolation of William from his family and friends.  Unhappy, confused, haunted by his adolescence, trying to kill all links to his family, he is always at an emotional distance from others.  This isn't simply a film about homosexuality, but one that addresses the most fundamental issues of how overwhelming our problems can become.  Those problems can force us into a world of our own until others come chasing after us, or we after them; in this respect, the distinction in 'Garden' is never made clear of who pursues whom, and in the surrealistic atmosphere of the film, the interchange of pain between William and others is at once seamless and profound.",N/A

Actually, upon watching it, it might perhaps be the subversive nature of the script which could explain its failure in America,  because it damns politics and the media within that country, and never  panders to the audience, delivering the ending it ultimately deserves. Of  course, Mamet is a first-class writer, and beyond all the clever barbed  swipes and witty asides, this is very funny story-telling which rather  perversely does make you feel happy afterwards, if only because it at least  shows that not all writers these days have to resort to jokes centred  around bodily parts. the commentary from Hoffman and Levinson is  informative but not very captivating (hear the worst De Niro impression  ever from Hoffman), and the essays and other such notes are extensive but  quite dull. The trailer also rather stupidly summarises the entire film in  a couple of minutes, so leave that until after the film, but the moving  menus are nice with some great guitar music from Mark Knopfler acompanying  them (he did the score for the film too). All in all, a worthy yet bland  package for a great film whose title is cleverer than a lot of movies'  entire scripts.",N/A

Anyway, this movie is sort of odd when you start to see  it.  We meet up with 5 people who are all in this giant cube area and must  move from cube to cube to find there way out, however, they need to find  this out first.  On there way to find it out, they encounter traps of  somewhat gory endings and also find another person on the way.

Where is the rest? So much  ado about nothing. This movie is not misunderstood. It's just not finished.  Large portions are missing, like plot, substance and cohesiveness. There  were many rambling conversations reminiscent of Woody Allen but not half as  good. Dark and eerie - yes. Thought provoking - no. Lots of questions - but  few answers. Up till the end I was wondering how Cruise and Kidman could  star in this cinematic, clearly expensive, excuse of a B movie.",N/A

191842,"I was originally given the book Lonesome Dove by Larry McMurtry when it first came out. Being a big fan of westerns I fell in love with the  characters and the action-packed story. As the mini-series was announced I  was both excited and skeptical at the same time. How could you take as  detailed a plot as Lonesome Dove is and give it justice? Very well it  seems.The series, starring Robert Duval and Tommy Lee Jones as retired  Texas Rangers, follows the book almost to the letter. As good as the stars  are (and Duval &amp; Jones ARE good) the series doesn't make it without the  VERY strong supporting cast. Danny Glover as Deets (the scout) Robert  Urlich as Jake Spoon (the gambler) Diane Lane as Lori (the good-hearted  whore) and Ricky Schroeder as Newt (the teen-age orphan) are all as good as  it gets. The action is non-stop and the twist and problems that befall  everyone throughout the story all seem true to life.I would strongly  recommend this mini-series to anyone looking for good story telling, great  casting, and exciting action.",N/A

357204,"This is a great movie if you would like to know the real story of Wyatt Earp. It's facts are ninety-percent accurate. Russel looks eighty-percent  like Earp. And the movie is seventy-percent enjoyable. Unless you have a  headache. Then it is fifty-percent. Russell has plently of chances to cock  his eyebrows and look tough. He declines and gives a superb performance. As  does Val Kilmer as Doc Holiday. Unfortanately, after an hour, it's as if  the director left town and they put Peewee Herman in charge. With gloomy  music from a B movie, we are suddenly cast into a twilight zone episode  where the good guys are surrounded by the bad guys. So we wait it out  tensely. Then we wait it out until we get tired. Then we wait it out until  we go into the kithchen and get some graham crakers. Then we have a splurge  of violence which is supposed make up for all the boredom we entailed. It  doesn't. Then the movie comes back from the bad direction. The last thirty  minutes are great. The writing never departs from being incredible.  Actually, many of the words are taken from historical fact. Earp did say  about Doc Holiday, &quot;I like him. He makes me laugh.&quot; Kilmer does a  tremendous job as the dying Doc Holiday. Russell is under-rated. He is  Wyatt Earp. Sam Elliot as Virgil Earp is Sam Elliot. A fine actor, but his  personality as Virgil Earp is abit over-shadowed by Sam Elliot. There are  some ridiculous moments. Like Russel going out into the rain and having a  screaming constest with Zeus. The best part of the film is the friendship  with Earp and Holiday. Thank God we have now have a good display of how  friendships are between two men. Nothing much is said but they do things  for one another. Once again, the director is terrific for capturing this on  film. Oh! Before you order the movie from Amazon.com, I would like to brag  and state that I sat next to Kurt Russel in high school! We never said a  word to each other. And after viewing the film, I think perhaps it was  better that way. Now purchase the most accurate portrayal of Earps and  Holiday's life availble on film.

But I still couldn't get my head around  this movie. Vincent Gallo just isn't credible as a revenge-plotting ex-con,  though the movie other major plot (dealing with the dysfunctional family)  works pretty well. The cast backing him up, with the exception of Christina  Ricci (she plays it as well as she can, but her role is just written  badly), injects some truly fine moments into this film, but a collection of  fine moments held together in an awful pit of celluloid does not a good  film make. Maybe someone will release an outtakes version (and cut out the  hideous soundtrack, which is basically the guitar solos from Yes songs redone badly).",N/A
387575,"The second-best crime film ever made, a completely original idea and  fabulous dircting makes The Usual Suspects what it is.  The characters  include five criminals, Dean Keton, a retired criminal who now is  romantically involved with a criminal lawyer, and they have gone into the  restaurant business together.  keton is played by Gabriel Byrne, who is  well-cast, but not as well-cast as he is in End of Days, where he plays the  devil.  Stephen Baldwin plays McManus, a loud, crazy, but effective entry  man.  He plays this sort of role to a T, but he has been type-cast for his  career thanks to his role.  Kevin Pollak plays Todd Hockney, the explosives  expert, who doesn't care about anyone.  Pollak is great at this kind of  role, and he has some great lines.  Benicio del Toro, in his breakthrough  role, is hilarious as a wisecracking criminal with a speech impediment.  The speech impediment, where he mumbles constantly, makes him hard to  understand, but it's very, very funny.  And finally, to round out the  criminals, Verbal Kint, a cripple, played by the not yet so famous Kevin  Spacey.  Kevin Spacey is awesome in this movie.  This is his best acting  job ever.  He won the Best Supporting Actor Academy Award for his work, and  it is well deserved.  The opening lineup scene is a classic, and is  possibly the greatest opener ever, second only to the Diner Scene, from  Reservoir Dogs.  The story is told by Kevin Spacey, who is the sole  survivor of a mass slaughter in the San Pedro harbor, involving a ship.  The five men were sent to destroy coke on a boat by the mysteriously shifty  Keyzer Soze, who has never been seen by anyone, that has lived to tell the  tale.  Spacey is telling his account to U.S. Customs Agent David Cuyan, who  has a personal vendetta against Keton.  The movie jumps around a little,  but by the second viewing it is easy to follow.  The chilling climax will  leave you speechless, and will put your head in a whirl.  Enjoy!","The Usual Suspects, Letterbox Edition VHS"

From the  opening shots of a city torn by gang warfare, through to the captivating  romance between Romeo (Leonardo DiCaprio) and Juliet (Clare Danes), to the  effective ending, this is entralling. The acting is good, and the fresh  approach gives a new edge to what may otherwise have been a tired story.

303278,"The French Connection is considered groundbreaking because of its  hard-boiled and gritty style, virtually unseen in crime dramas at the time,  and the elements that compose the film have now probably become something  of a cliche.  If anything, the film should be noted for being the first to  claim that piece of originality.  But the film isn't perfect or as great as  critics said because it does have its fair share of problems.I'll go  with the flaws first.  My main complaint is the musical score.  It took me  a while to figure out that banging sound in the background was supposed to  be the score, and boy is it annoying.  It really distracts and gave the  film a less riveting feel than it probably should have.There's also the  strange pacing, which goes from slow to fast at a moment's notice.  There  are also some confusing camera angles that give the film a semi-documentary  feel, which sometimes feels appropriate and at other time inappropriate.  The ending is also a little awkward, though my complaint about that is  actually minor.It may sound like I'm letting the film have it, but there  are a lot of redeeming qualities the film features.  Gene Hackman and Roy  Scheider are absolutely superb and they create characters more likeable  than I thought possible.  There's also the famous car chase, with Hackman  chasing after an assassin on board an elevated train above the streets of  Brooklyn.  It's an exhilarating 6 minute setpiece that ranks as one of the  top ten best car chases in film history (The tops belong to The Road  Warrior, Raiders of the Lost Ark, and Ronin).William Friedkin can create  riveting tales, and while The French Connection may not be his best work  (I'll save that for The Exorcist), there's no denying the occasionally  audacious successes the film makes.",The French Connection VHS

With a delivery in pure fun and entertainment. It brings up good  points about the flaws in things we have been spoon fed since childhood.  This film begs the question, why do we believe all this stuff set by man?  It does not abandon God, it shows us true faith (or an idea) is in us. We  can't have faith in the many beliefs that cause war and animocity. That  can't be what was intended.  As with all Kevin Smiths scripts all issues  are presented in a brilliant humourous light.

264257,"This is certainly one of the best musicals of all time. I know the motion picture is a little slow and drags at times, and may not be all that developed at some points, but I still rate it as one of my all-time fav.  movies. To start with, Yul Brynner was born to play the arrogant,  self-righteous King of Siam, and Deborah Kerr gives such a charming  performance as Anna Leonowens, the British School Teacher, that both actors  are perfect in every aspect and it's hard to imagine ANYONE else doing both  roles better than they did. But when it comes to Anna, part of the credit  goes to the ever-spectacular Marni Nixon who dubbed Kerr's singing voice.  She is my fav. singer by far, and I know for certain that no other singer  could have sung Anna's songs better than she did. That's a fact. Her  smoothe, gentle voice has probably NEVER sounded better. Just listen to her  'Hello, Young Lovers' 'Getting to Know You' and 'Shall We Dance'. You will  know what I mean. Plus, it's almost impossible to tell the difference  between Kerr and Nixon as they're voices are so alike.  Rita Moreno plays  Tuptim, the King's Burmese Concubine who runs away with her lover, Lun Tha,  the Emissary from the Court of Burma(Carlos Rivas). Moreno is undoubtedly  the ultimate Tuptim, since she captures the character's characteristics  very well. Terry Saunders made a pretty effective Lady Thiang, the  head-wife, Rex Thompson made an amusing Louis Leonowens, and Martin Benson  was splendid as the King's Prime Minister, the Kralahome, who is equally  arrogant and self-righetous as the King himself. The only problem I have  with the casting is Rueben Fuentes who dubbed Carlos Riva's singing voice.  He is awful and sounds old.  The direction by Robert Wise and the  screenplay by Eernest Lehman are also superb. I think the way the musical  was adapted into a motion picture was perfect. I know they had to cut off  many wonderful songs such as MY LORD AND MASTER(Tuptim's solo), SHALL I  TELL YOU WHAT I THINK OF YOU(Anna's soliquoly), THE ROYAL BANGKOK  ACADEMY(School Song), I HAVE DREAMED(Tuptim and Lun Tha's second song) and  WESTERN PEOPLE FUNNY(The Royal Wives' song), but the musical is adapted in  such a way that one can hardly ever miss the songs, despite how grand they  were. THE SMALL HOUSE OF UNCLE THOMAS - BALLET is also another highlight,  and in any case, the whole story concerning a British Widow and an Asian  Monarch falling in love is unique. I know that the ending is very sad and  very emotional, but the truth is, it could NOT have been better, and I for  one think it's one of the best 'endings' of all-time. In any case, the  songs in THE KING AND I were considered the best songs Rodgers and  Hammertsein ever wrote, and the musical is probably the most cherished of  all-time. You've simply GOT to see this. It will stay in your head for a  long, long time, and make you think alot too. It's well worth four stars,  and even five stars wouldn't be too much depending on one's opinion. I  think this is much, much better than THE SOUND OF MUSIC...",The King and I VHS

Mantan Moreland (billed second)  is a plus, Marianne Quon (as Chan's daughter) is a minus, because she  doesn't deliver dialogue convincingly. The underscoring is laughable, with  much-too-dramatic music blaring when nothing exciting is happening. The  tape's picture and sound are excellent.

But the story really never was the attractive feature of the  film. The mood and the emotional rhythm are uniquely wonderful, it is also  a film rich with multi-layered meanings. Monica Vitti is ravishing as the  complicated Claudia, she is truly a sight to behold, the most fascinating  face and profile since Garbo. A subtle study of the idle decay of the rich  and bored. The scenes on the island are unforgettably beautiful, mostly  because of the haunting cinematography.

This movie offers such an opportunity. All of the cast memebers,  but especially Meryl Streep and William Hurt, do an outstanding job in  presenting this tale of a family in crisis, and the hidden secrets,  weaknesses and strengths of its members and their enduring bonds to each  other. The photography is well done, and the sound is excellent as well.This is a worthwhile and serious movie, involving some interesting  intellectual issues about how the needs of a family of strong but loving  individuals and quite strong and needy personalities clash and interact  with each other over an increasingly critical stage of terminal illness for  the matriarchal mother of this modern American family. Overall, then, I  recommend this as an absorbing examination of an intellectual family with a  range of family issues such as rilvary, and a number of hidden dimensions  to the relationships within the family itself.

521913,"Yes its a masterpiece, but it has its flaws.  The storyline doesn't flow as coherently as I had hoped, its a little disjointed in places, with a few moments which were a bit slow and tedious, but the brilliant animation was enough to make up for it.  The themes of nature vs. human progress (on the brink of an industrial revolution here) is frighteningly similiar to reality, only our forests on earth do not have animal spirit-gods to protect them.  Their leader is a girl who believes herself to be a wolf - who is of course Princess Mononoke, raised by wolves and befriended by the wolfgods, she is the link between the human race and the mysteries of the forest.  There is the bad guy (in this case a woman), Lady Eboshi, who is spookily similiar to the antagonist in Hayao Miyazaki's other work, the spectacular &quot;Nausicaa&quot; (or &quot;Warriors of the Wind&quot; as was its title in the US). In fact, the whole movie is like a modern (or less modern) retelling of Nausicaa with a few new trappings.  The enviromentalist themes are all intact only this time there's no demon summoning, although a few boars get turned into them.Which leads me to a point.  I know ALOT of people in the United States especially are not familiar with anime tend to believe that animation = children fare.  Well this is not the case, anime is generally slanted for an adult audience, most often in very extreme cases, with R rated themes.  They are basically hard core sci fi or fantasy but set with moving drawings instead of live action.  The PG-13 rating is there for a reason.  This movie is violent, it is bloody, there are boars with their flesh rotting off, beheadings and other acts of violence.  But its not gratitious, there is reason behind it, this movie attempts to make many points on many levels and instead of just talking about it often gives us the visual images to go along with the message. It's entirely necessary and even made me a little queasy at times, but was more than worth it.  Children 12+ should be able to handle it if they are mature enough, although just the ideas of animals turning into demons by their inner hatred can be confusing, again its making a point that violence is not the way to go and that problems can be solved with other ways than falling back on the savage core of the living - which is hate.Of special note is Ashitaka's steed, a gazelle, who moves with such fluidity and grace, that everytime they take the screen together, I can't take my eyes off of them.  It's gorgeous watching it leap and bound across the screen, very well done.Overall &quot;Princess Mononoke&quot; comes highly recommended as a landmark in Japanese animation, however falls under the bar that was set by &quot;Nausicaa&quot; back in the 1980s.  Few movies have managed to eclipse that one in general but it still stands as the best of Miyazaki's work.  Anime fans have probably already seen it and loved it but parents beware that start to reach for the film based on Miyazaki's kid's fare like the often annoying &quot;Totoro&quot; and the sweet witch's fantasy &quot;Kiki's Delivery Service&quot;, that this is particular flick takes a much more mature direction and the real anime fans are thankful for it.",Princess Mononoke

474189,"Within minutes, I had decided I would like this movie.  The photography, acting, and sense of mystery were vivid and palpable.  I enjoyed the shift between sacred ritual and gritty lower-class dialogue.  The plot,  initially, pulled me in without telegraphing all its secrets.  Arquette in  particular continues a career of great performances; this lady can act!  But, as I reached the conclusion, I couldn't help but wonder if the  screenwriters got confused on which direction they were headed.  At some  points, Arquette's character is clearly antagonistic toward priests and  nuns--ala &quot;The Exorcist&quot; in a few scenes--but later we're told  she's the messenger for Jesus's words as revealed through the departed  spirit of a Brazilian Catholic priest.  The messenger premise would've  worked without the apparent presence of a demonic force.  The use of the  stigmata to validate her message was gripping and effective--if only the  end hadn't muddied their purpose.  I must, however, give a nod to the final  message itself...No, Jesus doesn't only inhabit buildings of stone and  wood; he wants to live within us.  That, at least, deserves an Amen.",Stigmata VHS

38969,"Final Destinations trump card is it plays off a devloped urban fear of accidents. Half of them frankly ludicruous they may be, but you can relate  to them having read about them in the papers which makes it hit home. There  in lies it's secret that the god aweful let down Scream 3 didn't have.  Though there is the occaissional bit of gore, Final Destination plays off  suspense more (especially during the opening which will put you off flying  for a few weeks). OK so it's not exactly primal fear and yeah i know that  films like The Omen and amityville tried a few years ago, but you can  relate to some of the deaths in this one much more.This isn't the usual  rip off or 'homagised' style suspense as some like to call it either. There  is a 'shock horror !' shred of originality in Final Destinations concept  and the way it's pulled off. No stupid thumping pop soundtrack either, in  fact thank god there is not one ironic refference or pop culture related  iconography in the picture at all. Final Destination gets back to what  horror is about before it turned to audience friendly trash - scares. Not  jumps, but scares. It may not be Texas Chainsaw Massacre, Last House On The  Left or The Evil Dead btu it's certainly better than most recent offerings  and at least tries to hurt the audience rather than just make them giggle.I saw this movie at the cinema thinking 'pop cultre scream clone',  thakfully it wasn't. Sure it's not like last years brilliance - Blair  Witch, but i thank all involved in the making of this picture for trying  something vaguely original. A class act !The DVD contains interesting  documentaries and and two commentary tracks.

But even as small as they do, I still felt as if I got to know them.The  music is not the standard with a latin flavor. Now I am not a fan of this  type of music, but it fit great into the pace and action of the  movie.Overall, it was a movie about killers killing each other, and  there was a ton of gun fights &lt;and other close range weapons&gt;, but  off hand I dont remeber a gorry or over graphic scene.

Problem is I did'nt expect the same as the previous trilogy to live up to expectation's but felt despite the wonderful although tell-tale CGI effect's there's still something to be said for more organic looking FX however these were on a grander-scale the story itself is fine but somewhat hollow even though it's setting it up for another trilogy the beginning it fall's rather flat all the same. Naturally previous character's Yoda the droid's and Palpatine are great welcoming re-addition's but something sorely lack's with the newly-seen one's like Qui Gon,Amidala and the like that seem devoid of any personality let alone real character although young Obi Wan Kenobi IS VERY GOOD though Ewan McGregor coul'dve been given more than what was presented. Production values were high but even the music score does'nt compare to the other's in the series. Enjoyable for light-weight entertainment but lack's nesscesary dramatic-pull power and involement. Liked the new addition characters Watto,Sebulba and Anakin's mum Shmi Skywalker but agree with most some reviewrs that the casting of Anakin as played by Jake Lyod was an error now forever committed to celluloid. Liam Neeson, Nat Portman were fine, Jar Jar Bink's may have irritated many other's except small kid's but I found him to be more vulnerable,sympathetic and human than the human cast.

We are plunged into the movie. No explanations. No motives are  outlined.

That does not ring true.Yes, it's a fairy tale, but  there is nothing magical about the discrepansies of the film - and it has  many. The script lacks integrity and all too often offends the common  sense. I was not surprised to see that Shayamalan person of Sixth Sense  fame as a co-writer.

The mouse suffers from some kind of guilty conscience and trying too hard  to please everyone. Every time he fails to do so the mouse succumbs to  depresion.

436163,"In the style of wacky runaway heiress or road buddies on the lam films a la Frank Capra, A Life Less Ordinary is a dark comedy that stretches the  definition of funny.  Director Danny Boyle's previous hits, e.g. Shallow  Grave, Trainspotting,  were morality tales with wit and style that defined  the British cinema of the 90s.  ALLO is not up to either wit or style in a  rambling odd story of frustrated love.  Ewan McGregor, an actor who is  lively and dynamic in his two previous Boyle pictures never seems to find  his character as Robert, a nebbish Scottish janitor in Salt Lake City, Utah  who goes ballistic when he is fired and replaced by a bad R2D2 imitation.  Camerion Diaz is lovely in the role of a spoiled brat kidnapped by Robert,  but the chemistry between the two actors never heats up the screen.  Wacky  heiress Celine can't sing or dance while the kidnapper sings and dances  rings around her.  Charming Robert can't threaten or write a convincing  ransom letter, but Celine is so condesending and  chrulish toward him that  sympathy transfers to the kidnapper instead of the victim.  Adding to the  muddle are two bumbling angels (Holly Hunter and Delroy Lindo) whose divine  task is to assure the mismatched pair fall in love.  It is a subplot that  distracts rather than adds to the story.  If the plot sounds confused it is  because Boyle never seems to make up his mind what the kind of film he  wants to direct.  The stellar cast attempt to save their roles but are  handicapped by a screenplay that never quite follows a recognizable genre.  The American film debut of director Boyle and producer Andrew MacDonald  flounders under so many problems that ALLO is comedic,  but it is a comedy  of error, misdirection, and ambiguity that fails to entertain.",N/A

30549,"You either like Woody Allen films or you don't, in exactly the same way as different personalities either attract or repel. With the same person  writing, directing, acting, and selecting  the music, Woody's films are  definitely &quot;up close and personal.&quot; So, the basic question is do  you like this &quot;double-talking, wise-cracking, pill-popping,  beaver-banging liar&quot; as he is variously termed by the other characters  in this film?Once again we have Woody's obsession with the interaction  between art and reality (see also 'The Purple Rose of Cairo'). The story is  about a writer who cannibalizes his own life and also feeds off those of  the people around him to achieve his success. This mirrors Allen's own  habits of 'narcissistic narrative' that is making films about himself and  constantly recycling his life on screen. We know that it is not Harry Block  who is hypochondriac, psycho-analyzed, sex-obsessed, guilt-ridden and  spiritually bankrupt. It is, of course, Woody himself. The characters he  creates, even the orthodox Jewish psychoanalyst played by Demi Moore, are  merely aspects of himself.Robin Williams plays a character who becomes  blurred so that the people around him have to get glasses to see him  properly. Woody wants people to see things his way, or, even better, use  this misplaced desire itself as artistic fodder.Allen seems  particularly interested in the contradiction that artistic success brings  wealth and fame and therefore desirability, but at the same time feeds on  those closest, on those attracted by the artist's genius. Moths to the  flame! This is explored to its limits as Harry becomes increasingly  isolated. His ex-mistress tries to kill him, his ex-wife (Kirstie Alley)  demonizes him, and even his girlfriend is more interested in Larry (Billy  Crystal) a man who puts his art into his life instead of the other way  round. His low point is reached when he is arrested for kidnapping his own  son. This seems symbolic. Perhaps Woody feels his critics don't want him to  keep using his own life as material!Harry Block/Woody Allen  internalizes his whole life and experience through the characters he  creates, and at the end where they hold a gala for him, they help him reach  a sense of wholeness. This is a complex, multi-layered, yet fast-moving,  and visually stimulating movie. The editing and flights into fantasy keep  boredom well at bay.

222891,"For being a S.T. fan since the late sixties, I'm ashamed to admit that I've only just watched this feature -- somehow it slipped through the cracks. Despite all the negative fan press I've read about it through the  years, however, I must admit that the bulk of this film is compelling and  works on a rather high level.Sure, there's little action, and the big  problem here is that the human interaction is limited and rather cold. But  the overall story is very well constructed, and manages to capture a sense  of adventure quite well. There are some odd dangling sub plots -- the film  starts out with someone being killed in a transporter accident, only to  have the crew beaming up the ship's doctor only minutes later as if nothing  happened. It would have also been nice if there had been the addition of  two additional scenes to more 'humnaize' this picture: a scene of dialogue  between Decker and Ilia; and a scene of the big three getting reacquainted  in the Captain's quarters. All in all though, the direction by Robert Wise,  combined with Dykstra's and Trumbell's special effects, give this film an  expansive, cold eerieness that hasn't been seen in the Star Trek universe  in a long time. All this film essentially needed was for a final edit, to  delete about 20 minutes of unnecessary reaction shots, and it would be  easily moved up a notch on most critic's lists. All in all, a solid effort  that was worthy of the franchise. Now I want to see a followup explaining  whatever happened to Decker.

320491,"One of the greatest satires ever filmed and Chaplin's most fully realized comedy.  A beautiful blend of the usual Chaplin slapstick and pathos along with a very effective social and political commentary.  Charlie is Adenoid  Hynckle, dictator of an only slightly fictional country of Tomania.  He  also plays a Jewish ghetto barber.  Both are played with such impeccable  accuracy that to distinguish between them is extremely easy.Names are  changed but this film is still the most effective film of Nazi Germany and  Hitler's thankfully aborted attempt to take over the world.  Chaplin's  script never gets too preachy at least without an equal dose of satire.  His approach is to make people laugh while teaching them at the same time.  Nowhere is this more apparent than in his final monologue.  After a  predictable mistaken identity episode, Chaplin as the unnamed Jewish barber  speaks of the horrors of Nazism.  This climazes what may be the greatest  performance in the history of comedy films.  The greatest because it does  more than simply make us laugh-it makes us think.  The film earned Chaplin  well deserved Oscar nominations for Best  Picture, Screenplay and  Actor.  This is a film you must see.",N/A

First of all, the ground-based subplot with Glenn Close as the vice president is boring and just detracts from the movie's momentum.  Also, it's kind of interesting that the evil Secret Service agent tries to kill Harrison Ford at the end, even though none of the other villains are left to expose him and he could walk away without ever being suspected.  There was some scene that actually explained WHY that guy was betraying the president, but thanks to some boneheaded editing it was cut out of the movie and that character was reduced to just another stock villain.  In addition, almost all of the action sequences are sick mockeries of reality.  Granted, I can sort of go along with having that much random automatic gunfire on an airplane without losing cabin pressure.  But it's just ridiculous when the characters stand next to a big open hatch without getting sucked out into the sky and their hair just blows in the wind like they're standing in front of a movie studio fan.  And the most unintentionally funny moment has to be when the plane crashes-- the whole shot, one of the most awful CG effects I've seen in a big studio movie, is pathetic and kind of sad.  I don't understand why this film has been so successful and popular, especially since we've all seen MUCH better action movies from directors like James Cameron and John McTiernan.

131021,"I think there reaches a point in the lives of many a movie star, where they get too big for their britches and decide, ""Gee, I'm so famous.  Everyone loves me.  My movies are always the best.  I get paid millions per picture.""  I have had it about up to here (imagine my hand at eye level) with Julia Roberts.  I am of the firm belief that beauty and charm do not an actor make.Allow me to expound on some of the sickeningly contrived plotline for you.  We first meet Ike Graham (Richard Gere), a columnist for USA Today, whose inspirations for his column come very last minute, and often as a result of an interesting conversation with a tavern drunk.  The audience tags along on just such a day when Ike learns from a barstool companion about a girl from his hometown who has left somewhere in the neighborhood of seven or eight men at the alter.Fast forward, Ike writes a woman-bashing article about the hometown girl, Maggie Carpenter (Julia Roberts) which is nothing short of slanderous.  She takes umbrage with this bit of irresponsible journalism and fires off a letter, stating she has left three men at the alter and is planning to wed soon, attempt number four.  She also attacks other aspects of his article, point by point.One must ask....wouldn't this person have people above him in the chain of command at USA Today who would never have allowed such reckless journalism to go unchecked?  Never fear, justice prevails!  Per the recommendation of legal counsel, USA Today kicks blasphemer Graham out on his can.  Although, his editor probably deserved some kind of reprimand as well.  Even big shot columnists need to remember, sticks and stones may break your bones, but WORDS can hurt just as badly.  So, licking his wounds, Graham goes after the REAL story about Maggie Carpenter, black widow of brides.  He is seeking to redeem his good name when he makes the trek to Hale, Maryland.Idiotic premise number one: since when does rural America mimic a Norman Rockwell painting?  As a denizen of rural Iowa, I am disgusted with the Hollywood stereotype of small towns.  Not everyone drives a tractor around town, not everyone knows everyone else, and not every small business owner hangs a cute little homemade sign in their shop window that says, ""Be back in five minutes"" so they can go see Earl at the corner barbershop for a quick shave and a haircut.  A good example of Hollywood's rural misconception is another Julia Roberts flick, Sleeping With The Enemy.  This story took place in Cedar Falls, Iowa.  A town I know and love, having been born there and having finished my elementary school years there.  Cedar Falls is a town of about thirty-five thousand, in addition to being home to the University of Northern Iowa, which boasts a student body of nearly fifteen thousand.  Yet, in that lame movie, there are bright smiling people standing around with their cows watching the American flag being raised in the town square.  Gimme a break.  Last time I checked, many towns have a leash law for dogs.  Taking your favorite bovine for a stroll downtown is not in the cards folks. Idiotic premise number two: a woman who repeatedly leaves men at the alter is still loveable and cute, just a little mixed up.  Hello?  I thought about going to [...] to find out what a psychologist might have to say about such a person.  But, I thought the better of it and asked a psychologist friend, actual real live guy, and asked him.Is a woman who repeatedly leaves men standing at the alter screwed up in the head?  YES!  He didn't use the phrase ""screwed up in the head"", that's what I said, he said some doctor stuff that I'm not smart enough to recall, but he basically concurred with my observation that Julia Roberts' character is cuckoo for cocoa puffs (this, also, is not a technical term according) and in need of some therapy.Idiotic premise number three: Julia Roberts and Richard Gere only make great movies.  Those two together in a film doesn't necessarily mean the movie is going to be any good.  It might make a lot of money, sure, but as for artistic integrity, not one iota.You may be hoping to see an updated, slightly different version of their first go-round Pretty Woman.  While Pretty Woman was a stretch story-wise and basically cornball, it was well-thought out and endearing anyway.  The mega stars seemed to put a little more stock in that one, with well-rounded characters and following the story through to the end.  Runaway Bride seems to have been an ant at a picnic for Gere and Roberts.  Annoying, but not much they can do about it, so continue on with the picnic.  Their acting is without conviction and about as multi-dimensional as a piece of paper.  In a nutshell, Runaway Bride is a predictable, blah movie.  There are some nice moments but they don't come often enough to pick things up.",N/A
417288,"Claude Sautet Nelly and Mr.Arnaud is a sumptous film to look at. Every frame in this film has bright and varied colors that look like pictures from an interior decorating magazine. It is at its most complling in its  early scenes between Nelly and Mr.Arnaud, he is somewhat overbearing in his  need to start conversation, or perhaps confess to past short comings. Yet  he never beats around the bush so to speak because as one character in the  film observes abot him &quot;He has lived two lives.&quot; Emmanuelle Beart  who is wonderful in this movie(and wonderful to look at) is quiet,  observant and in an offhand way suggest a deep intelligence behind these  eyes. She constantly handles herself in an relaxed manner, and only in the  end when she learns of Mr.Arnauds leaving that she is slighly shaken. She  like Mr.Arnaud has been through enough of life to have an understated  reaction to what goes on around her. The film is best enjoyed on a quiet  lonely afternoon where you can savour its decor and the almost to subtle  character revelations. The trouble is that its almost too understated  emotionally, the only music on the score that I recall is in the final  minute. The characters are too seasoned for us to enjoy their self  discovery. Perhaps the American equivelant of this film would be Martin  Brest's Scent of A Woman, both feature the regretfull confessions of an  older man to a seemingly distracted youthful companion. And although this  film is more subtle, I was dying for the emotional release, the operatic  splendor of that film. Nelly and Mr.Arnaud is intellectually satisfying but  emotionally underwhelming.

461215,"Taking the complex reign of Queen Elizabeth, a woman whose power rested in being underestimated by everyone (including many people who would have had her killed if they knew her mind) and turning it into a Godfather ripoff,  this movie does a bit of a disservice to most of the people in it. The  villains are simply evil. The heroes are pretty nasty too, and Queen  Elizabeth is more of a woman who needs rescuing by men.Geoffrey Rush's  Walsingham is like Robert Deniro from teh Godfather movies but more so. YOu  think that everything he's doing is without Elizabeth's consent. Another  historical figure who was nominally loyal but had to be executed because he  was stupid enough to think that he could marry the imprisoned Mary, Queen  of Scots without consequence, is here portrayed as a snarling surly  Catholic who would do anything to get rid of teh protestant queen. Slightly  insulting is the scene in which Elizabeth is having trouble at the court  and she runs off to be alone and sees a picture of Henry VIII and decides  that she is her father's daughter after all. Her transformation from a  maiden to a matron with white make-up and wig (historically more due to  fashion and smallpox than a virgin mary complex) is kind of ridiculous.What's good about this movie is the acting. Cate Blanchett and Geoffrey  RUsh are amazing and while Joseph Fiennes is little more than window  dressing, the rest of the ministers have their ticks. The story is  intriguing and even though it patterns itself after the Godfather  (including a &quot;everyone gets killed at once while our hero is in a  religious setting&quot; scene) it did pattern itself after something  great.The main problems I have is that Queen Elizabeth from Shakespeare  in Love captured the queen more. This woman was considered &quot;the silly  queen&quot; because she would cultivate a dippy personae that kept her from  getting killed by her Catholic sister. SHe had some Catholics killed and  some Catholics wanted to kill her but she certainly wasn't trying to co-opt  Catholicism and she managed to neither swing too far to the protestant or  the Catholic side of the spectrum and England prospered because of her. She  could be a vain and petty woman surrounding herself with sycophants but she  still knew how to see through the games and intrigues and played her own  very well (especially the marriage game in which her goal was to be single  her life with an entire country expecting a king at any moment.)So great  movie on its own. THe only reason why I'm taking off a star is becase the  historical facts had so much more potential for storytelling than this  movie would suggest.If you are interested in other Elizabeth stuff read  Alison Weir's books includnig The Children of Henry VII which goes from  Henry VIII's death to Elizabeth's acension to the throne with all the court  intrigues swirling around her. It's one of the best books written about  English history.",N/A

From the opening scenes of the beautiful Indiana countryside to the hollowed halls of Hinkle Fieldhouse at Butler University where the state finals were filmed, this movie is a  winner! I was actually in the film and spent 3 days filming in Lebanon,  Indiana (the semi-state game in the Jasper gym) and i must say it was a  treat watching Mr. Anspaugh, Hackman, Hershey, the ballplayers and entire  cast perform. The film has fantastic music, beautiful color and a wonderful  cast. If you hav'nt seen this future classic yet, head to the stores to  rent or buy it. You won't be disappointed.",N/A
509714,"**This review covers the 5.1 surround version, NOT the DTS version**I was anxious to receive this DVD, since I heard amazing things about its sound quality.  The DVD comes in an attractive case, with well-made graphic design on both the package and the disc itself.  A small pamphlet comes inside the package, with an interesting read about Spielberg and the film.  Not too impressive, but a good read overall.  I popped the DVD into my player and was very impressed with the simple, yet beautiful menu design.  Navigation is easy and the menu design couldn't be more simple, without lacking attractive graphical design.  In the menu, you have the choice of picking certain scenes with a very impressive moving scene index, and you can choose to have English subtitles.  The special features are put together very well.  You have a special message from Steven Spielberg, a behind the scenes featurette titled &quot;Into The Beach&quot;, the theatrical and re-release trailers, cast &amp; crew info and production notes. (Into The Beach is NOT on the DTS version because of space limitations.  DTS audio takes up much more disc space then other audio formats.  If you prefer DTS audio and don't mind the lack of the &quot;Into The Beach&quot; featurette, then make sure you order the DTS version.)  The audio choices you have are 5.1 digital surround and 2.0 Dolby surround.  Whatever type of system you have, be prepared for an audio experience that will overwhelm the senses.  Saving Private Ryan is an incredible film, a real tribute to those that put their lives on the line over 50 years ago.  Spielberg has created a film with top notch production values.  The cinematography and sound design, as well as the production design are incredible.  The picture quality of this DVD is superb.  It is very clean with beautiful detail and a look and style that is amazing, especially during the battle scenes.  The cinematographer Janusz Kamisnki, who I had the pleasure of working with once, did an exceptional job of bringing the viewer right into the extreme chaos of war, and creating a visual experience unlike any previous war movie ever seen.  The sound of this DVD is another story in itself.  The sound design of this film is just about flawless.  Incredibly realistic, unbelievably clean with beautifully recorded music and crisp, clear dialogue.  If you have a surround system, the war sequences will be nothing less then spectacular.  Even those with 2 speaker set-ups, the sound is amazing.  On 5.1 systems, gunshots and bullets will surround your head with such clarity, you may find yourself ducking for cover.  Sound design is ground-breaking, and the people responsible for it on this film should be applauded.  Deep bass is well used throughout the battle scenes, so your subwoofer will have an extreme workout.  The ambiance and atmospheric qualities of the entire film, along with the surround and effects elements, will give the viewer an unbelievable listening experience.  Add this to an incredibly visual film, and you have the stage set for about 3 hours of DVD pleasure.  I highly recommend this DVD to any fan of Spielberg, or to anyone who really wants to hear audio that is simply groundbreaking.  In conclusion, Saving Private Ryan is an excellent, well produced film.  A real tribute to those who risked their lives in World War II.  This DVD is excellent....buy it and enjoy it...an amazing treat for the eyes and ears.",Saving Private Ryan VHS

Playing this transfer side-by-side with a &quot;fullsceen&quot; VHS tape reveals, however, that the producers have done what my mother always complains of in letterboxing: &quot;They've chopped the top and bottom off!&quot; Usually, of course, she is wrong: they have simply restored the sides of the picture to view. Here, they have indeed not only left the Vistavision off the sides but reduced the top and bottom as well, giving a completely false &quot;widescreen&quot; impression. So we're getting a better picture but one which is, as my mother often quite mistakenly complains, actually smaller in scope than the &quot;fullscreen&quot; image. Boo hiss to the transfer guys.

This movie is all about perfectly  choreographed action scenes, plenty of sex, drinks (the immortal phrase,  shaken but not stirred), dry English joke.  In summary, this is a VERY  macho movie.  Under the guidance of the director, Michael Apted who's more  well-known directing dramas, Pierce Brosnan is given the opportunity to  play a more wholesome human character.  James Bond is always potrayed as  this super-spy who's able to save the world in the nick of time but never  are we shown his lonely side.  He's this man who's so good in his job that  his heart has been turned stone cold.  I couldn't agree more with other  fellow reviewers that Denise Richards is too pretty, too busty, too leggy,  too Californian to be this nuclear scientist.  But Sophie Marceau, she's  Sexy in capital letter. I wish the movie could concentrate more in  expanding the character of James Bond's nemesis in the movie, who's devoid  of any feelings.

394735,"This 1990 film by writer-director Whit Stillman is wonderfully refreshing and intelligent.  It is sure to please audiences with a taste for the avant-garde or those just looking for something a little different.The  story follows a group of upper-crust New York preppies during the Christmas  debutante season.  These are kids for whom black-tie balls at the Plaza  Hotel and charming little soirees in Park Avenue apartments are serious  matters.  They are the UHB-&quot;urban haute bourgeoisie&quot;-a social  circle carrying out traditions so anachronistic as to seem alien;  traditions, in fact, which were outdated before these characters were even  born.A middle class outsider and budding socialist named Tom Townsend  (Edward Clements) happens into this elite group and briefly livens things  up.  He shocks them with his leftist rhetoric (he is a devotee of Fourier)  and anti-deb outlook, but they nonetheless find themselves drawn to him.  Tom finds a kindred spirit in the cynically fatalistic Nick (Christopher  Eigeman).  Nick is the most self-aware member of the inner circle and he  provides comic relief with his devastating ongoing critique of their lives  and behavior.Stillman's characters seem to have everything going for  them.  They are bright and educated and come from very wealthy families.  We learn, though, that privilege is both their blessing and their curse.  These children of status are destined to always remain in the shadow of  their very successful parents.  As one of them puts it, &quot;We're doomed  to failure.&quot;  We come to realize that even though they are well-off in  many ways, they still must struggle with the same insecurities and fears as  the rest of us.The characters in &quot;Metropolitan&quot; are the kind  of people that F. Scott Fitzgerald knew so well.  Indeed, if Fitzgerald had  been a director rather than a writer, this is the type of film he might  have made.  It is intelligent and literate with dialogue that almost  crackles with its liveliness and wit.  &quot;Metropolitan&quot; gives us a  rare glimpse into a world that scarcely exists anymore, if it ever really  did.

If it were as broad as the latest slapstick from a Hollywood dream  factory, it might be more widely accepted, but it simply wouldn't be as  GOOD.That said, one important point I feel I need to make is that the  depiction of depression and anti-depressants in this movie is almost TOO  accurate.  Anyone who's ever gone through the throes of chronic despair --  not just moodiness, but the actual disorder called depression -- knows  where the characters in this movie are coming from. I don't know whether  they intended to make a philosophical point or not, but one has to debate  with herself or himself: would I risk being one of the five percent if it  would get me off this morose jag?Fans of the Kids In the Hall TV series  will appreciate the in-references peppered throughout this movie -- Mrs.  Hurdicure, or the guy whose name escapes me who can't bring himself to  admit he's gay.

449820,"David Selznick's Civil War blockbuster justifiably earned the &quot;classic&quot; that usually precedes any review of it.  This movie shows off its considerable budget, imagination and wealth of detail in  virtually every frame, and to top it all off, features an electrifying  ensemble of superb performers, all of whom chew into their roles with  relish.  What continues to surprise me about this movie is its freshness --  it never dates. The sexual tension that exists in every frame between  Vivien Leigh and Clark Gable feels every bit -- if not more so -- as sparky  and enjoyable today as it ever was.  The Margaret Mitchell story is  whittled down, eliminating some extraneous characters (some of Scarlett's  children for starters), but the streamlining does nothing but improve upon  the essentials of this big, sprawling epic, which manages to be both  intimate and satisfying as a melodrama of the highest order, and also as a  quaint, if skewed, look back at the most vicious battle ever fought on our  soil.  The production values continue to have your eyes popping out of your  head -- costumes, sets, sunsets -- all that COLOR drenches every inch of  the screen.  And the Max Steiner score still engenders goosebumps with  every viewing.  Vivien Leigh is so -- so -- SCARLETT it is impossible not  to envision her perfectly beautiful arched eyebrows whenever you hear the  name Scarlett O'Hara.  And the ending is one of the best in Hollywood  history -- it caps off the whole saga with humanity and more than a hint of  suspense.  Perfect.",N/A

24231,"I'm not sure where I'm going with this review because, frankly, I don't quite know what to make of this truly odd movie.  I like it, but I don't know why.  The first time I saw this film, I was certain I had wasted the  good part of $25 on a piece of stupid incomprehensible garbage.  But I  watched it a second time (hey, I might not have liked it, but I wanted to  get my money's worth), and it all suddenly fell into place.  The whole  thing kinda sorta made sense, and the overall &quot;look&quot; and mood of  the picture sunk in.  The plot is fairly simple, although there is some  confusion in a couple of scenes concerning the location of certain  characters and how they got there, as well as some surreal scenes that  simply defy logic.  These scenes don't affect the overall plot per se, but  they will have you tilt your head to one side and say, &quot;huh?&quot;.  The action is certainly over-the-top, with some of the strangest gun fights  on film.  How they manage to shoot at each other through windshields  (without breaking them, mind you) is quite a mystery.Other reviewers  have compared director Seijun Suzuki to other contemporary directors.  What  I find interesting about this film is its apparent influence on one of  Japan's biggest anime exports, &quot;The Castle Of Cagliostro&quot;.  From  Killer #3's clothing style to the bad guys' castle hideaway to the comical  gun-evading dance of his temporary sidekick, the influences are easy to  spot.  Given how the Japanese studio system worked in the 1960's, it's easy  to understand why Suzuki was fired for making this film.  It's so radically  different in every way from the typical Japanese potboilers that were  mass-produced.The Criterion edition provides a clean crisp widescreen  transfer with remastered sound.  The optional English subtitles sometimes  appear to have been greatly condensed, so you get the feeling during some  scenes that you're missing something.  There is an interview with Suzuki  which is, as are almost all Criterion interviews, very interesting.  One of  the disc extras includes a gallery of movie posters (Branded To Kill and  others) featuring the actor Jo Shishido and his famous collagen-enhanced  cheeks.  What's missing, in my opinion, is a commentary track for this  film.  How enlightening it would have been to get more background on the  actors, production, or script.  Oh well, you can't have everything.  But it  still doesn't detract from this fun and interesting film.And check out  the burning castle scene.  A stone castle gets tranformed into a blazing  inferno in mere seconds after the gasoline is lit.  It's a hoot!",N/A

When something blows up, or jets  fly, the sound is QUIETER than when people are talking.  These effects  should be louder.  If you turn up your system to hear the effects the way  you would like to, the next scene in which people are just talking ends up  being way too loud.  I guess the movie was mixed this way to prevent TV  speakers from popping, but I have a mid-to-high-end system, and this just  really bites.

463946,"When a new screenwriter is trying to get his script made, the best way to draw attention (nee money) is to attach a star, someone with visibility, someone bankable. Surprisingly, I don't think stars really read a lot of  scripts, certainly not all the way through, certainly not with a mindset  toward how to make this into a good, completed film.At the time this  film was made, Kevin Spacey was hot, very hot. His performances in Seven,  Swimming with Sharks, and The Usual Suspects had brought him not only rave  reviews, but an Academy Award. His want to direct, this inherent heat, plus  his ability to attract additional star power, namely Faye Dunaway, Matt  Dillon,  and Gary Sinise, and a spec script from a first time writer had  the financial backing it needed.Maybe Albino Alligator would have been a  weak film in even the most accomplished hands, it certainly is a weak film  in this first time director's.

The cameos,  supporting roles, and stars all shone equally. This film is a triumph on  Branagh's part, even better than his masterful Henry V. He's followed in  Olivier's footsteps and even superseded him in many respects. I didn't for  a moment doubt any of his choices, either as actor or director. For me,  this is the definitive Shakespeare recording of the modern era. Enough  said.",N/A

186046,"&quot;Swept Away&quot; is, first and foremost, about Italians! The class and political conflicts portrayed are rooted in Italian life and culture. To be sure, the basic male-female rich-poor antagonism is universal, but  the specifics of their struggles and their very personalities are as  Italian as, well, pasta! Those politically-correct types who would focus  solely upon the scenes of Giancarlo Giannini smacking around Mariangela  Melato seem also not to notice that, leading up to it, he is subjected to  the worst kind of verbal cruelty and less-than-human treatment from  Melato's character. They also come away with the notion that the film  propagates the idea that a woman can only be happy if a man cruelly  dominates her. I would think this superficial understanding is innately  absurd, since a woman directed the film! Of course, this is not at all what  the film is about. Both characters are deeply flawed, but their conflicts  with each other and within themselves are wonderfully funny and sweet and  sad. I would say that Wertm&uuml;uller ultimately wants us to believe that  Melato's character (and women) are the more moral (and less hypocritical)  by having her recognize that, in spite of her newly developed (and I think  genuine) feelings for Giannini's character, she must ultimately let him go  - quite simply because he (and she) are married to other people!

This one goes into the straight-mystery genre, and many  elements of Profondo Ross can be found here, even down to similar scenery.  The plot, also, is a familiar one-- a serial killer stalking the streets of  Italy and an American citizen staying in Italy who gets himself involved in  the investigation. It seems almost as if Argento were cutting his teeth  here, preparing himself and getting his symbolism in line for the real  work; as such, The Bird with the Crystal Plumage is for Argento fans only;  others would be much better served finding a copy of Profondo Rosso.",N/A

I can't think of any other reason that &quot;Contact&quot; wasn't resoundingly laughed out of bookstores, much less theaters. I know my friends and I were reduced to helpless tears halfway through.The very notion that Jodie Foster is listening to the various frequencies that SETI is scanning for signs of extraterrestrial life is foolish enough, but then the flaws are compounded by repeated improbable meetings with priest Matthew McConaughey. Apparently, his character's dialogue with Foster's is supposed to be thought-provoking and challenging. Apparently, the screenwriters have never actually had a thought-provoking or challenging conversation.The payoff to all this foolish mumbo-jumbo is a machine the alien message provides for communicating with them, followed by actual contact. Sagan boldly goes where few esteemed figures have gone before, and rips off John Varley's novel &quot;The Ophiuchi Hotline&quot; for the idea of the aliens giving out plans for an interstellar communication device. Then we get the note-for-note theft of the climax of &quot;2001: A Space Odyssey.&quot; Space turns out to be Heaven, where lonely little girls can meet aliens-shaped-like-Daddy.

463367,"A Simple Plan is a beautiful movie, one which plays it low-key throughout, never resorting to shock tactics to create horror in the viewer. All it needs to do this is show the events as they come, as there's nothing more  terrifying than, as the tagline for the film says,  good people doing evil  things. This is one of the only films where the sheer banality of evil has  been portrayed properly, and the acting is superb. Even Paxton who is  normally rather dull manages to create a believable character - just watch  the moment where he suffocates someone with his bare hands, an instance of  very good acting. The photography is excellent, showing that Raimi is a  talented director in any genre. The portents of the awful events to come  are marvellous, like the use of the crows who act as some kind of silent  narrators. The book was much more bloody, but I feel that it is for the  better that this is not carried through to the movie (the original author  wrote the screnplay, so who am I to argue). The picture quality is very  good, picking out single snow flakes, and the trailer is suitably  foreboding. A commentary from Raimi and the cast and crew would have been  nice, but hopefully that will come in the future when this is re-released  as the classic that it surely will become.

The dialogue is corny, and there are some of the worst wigs and fake beards you will ever see (Maximillian Schell plays Lenin, and his head looks like a domed stadium.)

This film, following an outcall prostitute from client to client, unflinchingly looking at the abuse to which she is subject to, is very much in line with these concerns, and is beautiful, ugly, and by the end, vaguely hysterical, even surreal. It's fascinating to watch and disturbing at the same time.

Taking place during a period when all of Europe was competing for the riches of the world, the story starts off with the last  ship of a lost fleet, down to a skeleton crew (in size as well as health)  trying to find &quot;the Japans&quot;. Pilot-Major John Blackthorn, played  well by Richard Chamberlain, wakes up on shore in Japan after barely making  to land. Used to being in control, he is swept up in all the politics and  violence that this period of Japan could offer. In just the first day alone  he sees a beheading, is forced to listen to one of his crew boiled to  death, and must endure the shame of having a Samurai &quot;relieve  himself&quot; on his back. He then becomes a pawn between two lords, the  brutal Ishido, and the cunning Toranaga. As Blackthorn begins to understand  the culture, he also begins to build his own power and worth, causing  Toranaga to realize the value of the Englishman.Throughout this  mini-series the photography is stunning, the action impressive, and the  romance steamy. The acting here is also probably the best overall of any  epic film. The film follows closely to the book with minor exceptions, and  keeps the viewer riveted throughout the entire series. Also the continual  battle between Blackthorn and the Jesuit Priest, Father Alvito, seems to  have been written to match the feud between Ishido and Toranaga. Both feuds  are intense and gut-wrenching, leading though to different types of  endings.This series is a great story, told well, and captures the  imagination quickly. I would recommend this to any viewer who likes an  action-packed and entertaining adventure. Just be prepared: There are some  scenes that are a little violent. This was necessary to get the feel for  how violent this period was in Japan, however it can still be a wee bit  disturbing. This is probably not for the pre-teen crowd.",N/A

Knightriders falls into the latter  category.  It is pointless, unwatchable, and incredibly, unbearably long.  I mean, with most bad movies you can at least sit there and make fun of  them to ease your suffering, but Knightriders doesn't let you off that  easily.

22042,"Six out of ten directors these days use music-video techniques in narrative film, and most of them in a hackneyed way, but in Bandits Katja  von Garnier shows them how it should be done.  Utilizing the kinetic energy  of music-video techniques but blending them seamlessly with charged  cinematic storytelling, a crackling script, and uniformly good acting, von  Garnier's film is a playful and satisfying journey, one of the few  rock-band stories to have held my gaze.The movie's first asset is its  diverse lead characters:  Jasmin Tabatabai is electrifying as loose cannon  Luna, while also having penned most of the songs on the soundtrack.  During  the music-video sequences, which are so expertly edited and nicely timed in  the film so they don't seem jarring at all, she becomes a rock goddess,  while also holding her own with comic timing and during the more sensitive  sequences.  Katja Riemann is great as brainy, middle-aged drummer Emma, and  when Emma and Luna share their heart-to-heart on the street after Luna's  drunken binge, it's the most beautiful moment in the film, where von  Garnier reins in her  camera and lets the actors breathe.  Not-too-bright,  vulnerable bassist Angel (Nicolette Krebitz) and melancholy keyboardist  Marie (Jutta Hoffman) round out the band, helping to provide shades,  diversity and tension.The music itself isn't for everybody, but the  sheer diversity of styles incorporated in this movie is refreshing:  From  hard rock to riot-grrl punk, from girl pop to acoustic folk, from blues to  a lounge act (destined to go bad, L7 style) -- though it's not perfect  music, it fits the tone of the movie perfectly, augmented by the fact that  it *is* written and performed by the Bandits of the movie (aside from  covers).In the end, like Run Lola Run, Bandits negotiates its stylistic  innovations such as disrupted time (absolutely brilliant editing by Hans  Funck), dramatic ellipses and &quot;invisible&quot; payoffs with a sense of  fun and moments of true catharsis to make a grandly enjoyable whole.",N/A

430025,"John Woo's &quot;Face/Off&quot; is one of the best of all action films because it isn't just driven by great action sequences and style, its true force is behind the great performances by Nicolas Cage and John Travolta.  What's amazing here is how we are completely convinced that one character  is suddenly playing another with the other's face on. This isn't just a  showcase of superb, hyper action, but also of great acting. Travolta  incredibly seems to have Cage's first role and Cage seems to perfectly be  Travolta's first role. Now about the action, it's also superbly done. No  one films violence like John Woo, who gives gunfights here an artistic  quality in the moves, the guns, the clothes, the way the camera moves.  There is a shoot-out near the end inside a chapel and Woo let's us see the  bullets in slow motion blast out from the barrels. He doesn't make action  boring as do some other action filmmakers, he gives it tremendous art  potential. &quot;Face/Off&quot; is never boring, always active and has  enough plot for an entire series. The screenplay is full of imagination and  the entire film is rich in detail. I have seen few action films done so  well. Many of that kind are rare like &quot;The Rock.&quot; Woo has a great  eye for style that vibrates off the screen. &quot;Face/Off&quot; is a  fantastic action piece because it's driven more by it's actors and  performances than by it's action sequences.

Too bad 2000 isn't shaping up as good, let's just hope it gets better.I think that it is a great shame that the DVD version does not offer the alternate ending. This 'alternate ending' was completely different and is said to hold the best bits of Conrad Hall's brilliant cinematography.

16266,"After their teaming just 5 months prior, in the Hitchcock masterpiece VERTIGO,  this movie may seem small potatoes, but it's a little charmer with fun performances from all.  An entertaining film which offers the exquisite beauty of Kim Novak and the droll talents of the likes of Jack Lemmon, Ernie Kovacs, Elsa Lanchester (as Gillian's delightfully giddy Aunt Queenie) and Hermoine Gingold. On stage, the Van Druten play had served the then-married Rex Harrison and Lilli Palmer well, and, while granted, Novak was no Palmer, she nonetheless offers her own style in this very nice little comedy about witches, magic and spells.  For Stewart, it must have been a pleasant and relatively easy assignment, and in the listing of his films, it's interesting as the point  where he ceased to be a romantic leading man; in his movies, he would court no more.  With the exception of THE MAN WHO SHOT LIBERTY VALANCE, in which he would win and marry Vera Miles, Stewart would either be a married man or a loner.  Jimmy was now 50, and he agreed with the critics that it was a little off-putting for actors of that age to be cast opposite much - obviously - younger actresses.

Not that they didn't try, but they were both absurdly miscast since neither of them has done in real life the sort of comedy their characters do. And it shows: their supossedly hilarious TV sketch looks so forced, the child actor in it has to fake his laughs. They all do, actually. The entire thing feels forced and embarrassed.Besides, Falk is shown much too old and meaner than the part requires and Allen looks like a fish out of water in every routine; he's a great comedian but no vaudeville sidekick, and one just can't buy these guys were ever partners, let alone successful ones.Still, I hope they had much more fun doing this half-baked TV remake than I had watching it.

108712,"&quot;Caddyshack&quot; has to be among the top ten funniest films of all time for a number of reasons. #1) The supporting cast. Although not overtly funny, both Chevy Chase and Ted Knight play straight men to two funny comedians: Chase's character to Bill Murray's wacky, doped-out greenskeeper character. An example here is during the scene when Chase is visiting Murray's residential quarters, and Murray offers Chase a place to sit and relax, and Chase says: &quot;No thanks, I don't want to stick to anything&quot;. Knight and Rodney &quot;I get no respect&quot; Dangerfield have some classic exchanges throughout the movie as well. You'll have to hear them for yourself.  #2) Dangerfield is a class act all by himself in &quot;Caddyshack&quot;. With comical lines like &quot;Last time I saw a mouth like that, it had a hook in it&quot;, &quot;Now I know why tigers eat their young&quot;, &quot;Hey toots, how'd you like to earn ten dollars the hard way&quot; and many others, it's easy to see why Dangerfield became a mega-superstar soon after &quot;Caddyshack&quot; was released. #3) There's also the Baby Ruth bar in the swimming pool bit, which is a must see. If you ask me, the Rodney Dangerfield barbs are alone worth the price of this classic film. Kenny Loggins' smash hit &quot;I'm Alright&quot; is a perfect mini-soundtrack for the movie. As an added bonus, there is a trailer before the movie. You'll hear from the stars themselves talk about the making of &quot;Caddyshack&quot; as well as personal moments and their memories in making this comedy masterpiece. This movie shows no sign of wear and tear, and doesn't appear to be dated, even after a little more than twenty years!

James ""I am king of the world!"" Cameron vs Curtis Hanson. The parallels are striking.To me, its loss of the Oscar to Titanic reflects not on L. A. Confidential, but on the Academy.

The musical score and songs aren't as good, but some songs  stand out (Back To School, We're Gonna Score Tonight, Cool Rider, Who's  That Guy?, Prowlin, Cherades, A Girl For All Seasons, and We'll Be  Together). Character wise it's not as good. The dialoge seemed a little  more real. The movie was a little more fun, and not as serious, but some of  the songs are completely ridiculous (Reproduction, Do It For Our Country).

She is hassled initially by the children of the family until they grow up. The  husband is rarely home - far too busy drinking, gambling and womanising to  tend to his family, and as she grows older, she watches the family lose its  wealth until the point where they can no longer afford to keep servants,  and she becomes a live-in servant of a wealthy pianist. Although he  initially has a girlfriend, he becomes taken with his new hired-hand, and  they marry. This film is excellent, and relies often on the ample  soundtrack and facial expressions of the girl, whose delight in all that is  simple (she spends ages watching the insects go about their business at one  stage) is a sheer delight. And although we see more of her at this stage of  her life, the actress who plays her when she has reached her twenties in  the last third of the film is no less capable.

Large  rooms filled with frothing fanboys dressed as Vulcans or Klingons, and  those are the guys who run the dealer tables, over priced merchandise that  you could have found at your local comic shop for half the price, crammed  into too small lecture halls watching 9th generation copy of Urutskodoji,  or a chance to meet the guy who almost played the stand in for Patrick  Stewart in episode 406 of Star Trek: The Next Humiliation. And perhaps  worst of all, the fans themselves, who care more about how warp drive works  than personal hygiene.The horror. The horror.`Galaxy Quest'  is a good-natured poke at science fiction fandom, which is good, because  there are a lot of good things about fandom, having met many good friends  at conventions, seen wonderful costumes by very passionate and talented  people, and engaged in some very good discussions and debates with some  very smart people. In `Galaxy Quest', Tim Allen place Jason Nesbet, the  star of a long since cancelled TV series of the same name that has a very  loyal following of fans, and like Stat Trek, just can't let the series die.  Allen is joined by Sigourney Weaver in a grey and red jump suit with blonde  hair...the single best part of the film, as burnt out actors who attend  these conventions, sometimes as their only means of making money. (Not  really a joke, check to see how much James Doohan makes for appearing at a  World Con.)All of the actors are upset at Nesbet as his ego spirals  out of control and he ends up alienating most of his fellow cast members  (are we paying attention Mr. Shatner?). they gripe about him always getting  the girl, always getting to take his shirt off, that is until they find  themselves aboard a very real working replica vessel of the one they used  in the TV series and fighting a very real war. Built by aliens who received  transmissions of the show and believed them to be historical documents,  they rebuilt everything they saw on the show, even the massive starship  Protector (incidentally, the `NTE' in `NTE-3120' stands for `Not The  Enterprise'), against a race of reptilian alien uglies who want to destroy  this nice alien race who built all of this great stuff because,...well,  that's not important. Strangely, the film actually pulls itself together as  a friendship piece. Did I just write that?Sometimes I got the  feeling that they writers really wanted to take some gut shots at fandom,  other times the jabs were well meaning and flattering. It also becomes  apparent that the series endures because of the fans (something Paramount  has never learned about Star Trek. How many web sites have they closed?).  `Galaxy Quest' has some honestly funny moments, but where it falls apart is  the editing, which comes across as very unprofessional with one bad take  leading into another. The special effects, (ILM again), are first rate,  even the stuff they did as out takes from the old series had a nice period  look to them. The NTE-Protector is actually quite beautiful, with just a  hint of Enterprise for inspiration. A great film? No. A good one? Yes. Mel  Brooks' `Spaceballs' did it first and did it better.",N/A

He is  misunderstood though, as he is ridiculed throughout the film for trying to  be a success with the art form that he loves. Not until he is able to use  the notoriety of Malkovich, is he able to show the world what the artistry  of puppeteering is really about. I think this is true in the real world as  well. With all the different talents out there that people possess, I think  it's a shame that only a few are accepted and promoted by a mass audience.

For example, I  noticed that the French version had better visual quality than the English  version, like during the intro, when the title &quot;The Shadow&quot;  appears.  I think this DVD is a direct-from-VHS copy.  Not the best of all  methods!The features are quite limited.  It is not even widescreen.

144830,"This movie could also have been called The Daughter From Hell.  Joan Crawford plays a very giving mother who wants her children to have the best of everything (especially Veda).  To accomplish this, she starts her own  business which becomes incredibly successful and she  sacrifices herself.  Her reward is the most selfish, uncaring, self-centred daughter you'll ever  see on the screen.  I have certain problems with this film.  First of all,  I'm not a Crawford fan, although I will admit she's good in the movie.  Secondly, I have hard time believing this mother-daughter relationship  (it's too extreme).  And thirdly, the movie leans more closely to melodrama  than film noir (which is what I wanted to see).  Having said all this, I  would still recommend the movie because there is a pretty good mystery in  the way the plot is constructed, Eve Arden is great as Joan's wisecracking  assistant, and Ann Blyth is excellent (you'll hate her) as Veda, the  daughter no one would want.  It's a well made movie, and it will probably  appeal to a lot of people.",N/A

377181,"I will not say something amazingly original if I use that &quot;if you are going to see one anime in your lifetime see that one&quot; phrase. But it fits perfectly.I've tried to enjoy a lot of anime afterwards but in  vain. The genre seems to be mostly unaccessible to a middle-brow Western  viewer - it puzzles me, irritates and I push the STOP button long before  the credits appear, accompanied by a sweet-voiced Japanese song. Then I  tell my son it's all hopeless and I don't wanna see the stuff made by  robots for robots any more.It's strange, because I am not ignorant of  the workings of Japanese mind. I've read and enjoyed immensely The Tale Of  Genji, The Pillow Book(see the review), Heike monogatari and lots more.Still the 95% of anime is beyond me.Ninja Scroll is a classic quest  with the fearless hero and the very lovely heroine condemned by fate - the  characters you can care about. There is a mystery to solve, the adversaries  with a very different fighting style that make all the action scenes  captivating. The film overflows with emotion - love in it's gay and  straight varieties,the sense of duty, betrayal, resolve, revenge, fierce  glee, lust and devotion. The magic is not as weird and outlandish as we are  used to expect from Japanese produce.The graphics are great - I do not  want them any better. English language track is 5.1, but my son and nephew  always insist on the Japanese stereo - it provides them with the phrases to  memorize and cry out while having their try at the flying kicks.Yes,  there is some gore and sexually explicit scenes but a much more horrible  things are readily accessible by pushing a few buttons in the home  computer. So I try to minimize the damage by dealing with these scenes  jockingly - there is no sense in sitting through them in embarassed stupor,  you have to react somehow, to comment. But of course all that is very far  from the conventional notion of the family entertainment.I consider that  disc a must-have in any DVD library.

479525,"A lot of people have David Lynch pegged as a filmmaker obsessed with darkness, depravity, grotesquerie, perversion and weirdness for its own sake.  Not to sound too ....., but these people are immune to visual poetry and should stick with Adam Sandler or Schwarzeneggar movies.  Yes, there are some elements of all of the above in Lynch's work, but always too there is a sense of humanity, a certain skewed grace.  With The Straight Story, the spirituality that has always been present in Lynch's films comes more prominently to the fore than it ever has before (with the possible exception of The Elephant Man).  The Straight Story lacks much in the way of outright strangeness in terms of content, but the general oddness of Lynch's style, his unique sense of composition and editing rhythms, his whole way of seeing, is very much in evidence here.  Based on the true story of Alvin Straight, an old man who made a 300-mile journey by riding mower to see his estranged brother, The Straight Story is so, well, straightforward and simple that it achieves a kind of purity.  By all accounts, on a personal level Lynch is an unusually warm, sweet guy and I can believe it. This film couldn't have been made by someone who wasn't a fundamentally clear-eyed, good man, and the deep-down decency of Straight is accordingly made palpable by the deep-down decency of the director.  When Alvin finally meets up with his ailing brother, the film ends with an exchange between the two that is so understated and eloquent that it's almost startling in its power.  Eschewing any trace of cheesey sentimentality, Lynch makes a statement about the importance of love and forgiveness that even the most hardened cynic would be moved by.  If you missed this in the theater, the widescreen DVD is the only way to go.  Don't miss this remarkable film.",The Straight Story VHS
524582,"Tommy Lee Jones and Samuel L. Jackson are excellent as usual in their roles:  two old friends from Vietnam whose careers took different courses  after a firefight that badly injured Jones.  Jackson's Marines rescue a  cowardly ambassador and his family from an embassy pelted with rocks,  insults and the occasional sniper's bullet.  In return for this service,  the ambassador will testify that Jackson lost control and opened fire on a  crowd full of unarmed civilians, because his superior at the Department of  State thinks he should to save the American reputation in the Middle  East.The basic story is good and the actors have amazing presence, but  there are a number of amusing inconsistencies in the script, like:1)  Dale Dye, as Samuel L. Jackson's commanding officer, asks him whether he  wants private counsel or the base legal office to represent him (if you  watch this in a theater full of military personnel, expect this line to be  among the funniest in the film).  This occurs right in the middle of him  briefing the man whose court-martial he will convene, which happens  absolutely never.2) Why didn't anyone analyze the bullet holes in the  embassy wall to establish trajectory?3) How the hell do you find a  Vietnamese company captain from an action that occurred thirty years ago  with no sort of attention at any previous time?  (This probably makes no  sense to you if you haven't seen it, and it really won't in the film,  except to make the point that even officers on opposing sides have the  common trait of valuing their troops' lives more than anything else on the  field of battle.)The conflict between functions of state and defense  isn't as implausible as the reviewers appear to think, particularly in a  time when we deploy our soldiers and Marines to the world's least desirable  corners as beat cops.  Whether you set this story in Yemen or Kosovo or  somewhere else, it can happen, it has happened and will probably continue  to happen.  State wants its wars to resolve neatly into ends comfortably  discussed in meetings over tea, and gets annoyed when Defense reminds them  that rules of engagement always make room for an exception necessary for  saving lives.Rent it before you buy it.",N/A

474198,"Stigmata is by far one of the best movies I've seen- it is really incredible in comparison with other movies that try to achieve its success.This movie is strange, and sometimes even slightly sinister in  its portrayal of a woman named Frankie Paige in New York (Patricia  Arquette) who is afflicted with the Stigmata, or the wounds of Christ. An  open minded priest (Gabriel Byrne) ends up meeting with her, and is  extremely surprised to find that this claim of Stigmata occurences is true,  despite the fact that Frankie doesn't go to church. In fact, Frankie isn't  very religious at all, and lives the shallow, hip life of a partying  hairstylist. The contrast between the Church and the life of this young  woman is brilliant and stunningly effective.The rest of the movie is  spent discovering more about the situation that Frankie is in, and the  possible implications it could have to the church, and to the religion  itself. In the end this movie is a deeply thought provoking exploration of  religion itself, how everything that is accepted by the church may not be  the truth, and how what many of us follow could be completely backwards. It  really makes you think.This already strong movie is further enhanced  with the visual effects- so much so that you could buy this movie just for  the incredible scenes. All of the wounds of Christ shown in the film are  very realistically, enough so that many squeamish people may have to turn  away from the screen during these moments. The the way the wounds are shown  to occur (chaotically, and in sudden flashses) is incredible, adding to the  suspense. Also, in the climax of the film there is one particularly  rewarding scene which you might just have to watch over and over (it's too  cool!)This movie is definitely and incredible achievment in filmaking,  with a great and intellectual plot expressed with beauty. Some people may  not like it as much if they are sensitive to graphic scenes, or if they  don't like content that has to do with religion.

58058,"First of all...I loved it. This is another one of those emotional films by Steven Spielberg, but like the others, he does a great job with a difficult story line. This is not a feel good movie, nor does it make you feel like  you want to go out there and change the world; what it does do, is make you  sit back and reflect upon an incident in our nation's history that will  disappoint you. The story line centers around the capture, detainment,  transportation and murder of men, women and children who are being brought  to the United States to be slaves in 1839. The Africans on the ship  &quot;Amistad&quot; rebel, take control of the ship, and attempt to go back  to Africa to be free. Their dream for freedom is short-lived as their ship  is captured by an American Naval ship and brought to the United States. The  Africans (led by Djimon Hounsou) are placed on trial, they are fighting for  their freedom, but their lawyers and the politicians have turned it into a  fight over the issue of slavery. The Africans win the first few rounds only  to have their freedom appealed to the U.S. Supreme Court, where former  President John Quincy Adams (Anthony Hopkins) is recruited to defend them.  I was saddened by the role that politics played in this freedom fight and  how President Martin Van Buren fought not to do what was right, but fought  instead to save his re-election. Earlier I said this film won't make you  want to go out and change the world...I think it's because after seeing  this film you realize that these political games have been played for the  past 160 years by Presidents and you are just fed up. The sad part is to  those who are the victims in these political games...don't consider it a  game nor do they have a fair chance to win.

229228,"This problem was impossible to surpass.  Calling it exploitative of Lee's death and legacy would be stretching it, seeing as Lee himself committed to the role (not like they slapped together footage of him, as with so many  other &quot;Bruce Lee clone&quot; movies and posthumous releases).  But in  terms of quality, this movie certain has some insurmountable  problems.First, of course, the conspicuous absence of the hero from  about half the scenes.  Impossible problem to get around, but they  compounded it by using a dubbed voice and body doubles for pathetic  stand-in scenes.  I suspect it would have been much more feasible to simply  use what they had and write a new script around the footage.  Marks to  Colleen Camp (who appeared in Die Hard with a Vengeance 20 years later),  gamely playing a love interest without the lead around, and Bob Wall and  Samo Hung, who present a pretty nicely choreographed fight  scene.Cinematically director Robert Clouse is no genius, but his shot  selection is considerably better than Lo Wei's and even Lee himself (Return  of the Dragon was directed by Lee and, despite tremendous fight  choreography, was poorly shot and acted).The climactic showdowns in this  movie are overrated -- the nunchaku dual could have been staged much  tighter, and the use of those limp-looking, coloured weapons was a  mind-bogglingly tasteless choice.  Everytime the nunchaku strike flesh, you  could almost hear the &quot;splat&quot; of the soft-looking sticks hitting  a face.  The second fight (the white-robed master) is much better.  The  third fight was a huge letdown, the Kareem Abdul-Jabbar/Bruce Lee showdown  being heralded to the stars, but in fact a slow-moving, uninteresting,  unconvincing brawl.  Bruce Lee isn't known for his wrestling techniques  (fluidity being one of his principles), and in this fight he's relegated  mostly to grappling and gritting his teeth.There are definitely better  Bruce Lee movies.  Still, I'd take this one over any of Van Damme's  kickboxing movies.",Game of Death VHS
481330,"""Dreamscape"" is one of those often overlooked cinematic gems, which came on the vanguard of the mid-80's resurgence of lower budget SF which included  ""Real Genius"" and ""Wierd Science"", among others.Here we have Dennis Quaid exercising every charsima cell possible as a  washed-up psychic, who is enlisted by former mentor Max Von Sydow into a  top secret program to enter and control people's dreams.  Overseeing the  project is shady government spook played by Christopher Plummer, with plans of  permanently correcting US President Eddie Albert's apocolyptic nightmares.  Of course, some of the more fantastical SFX that seemed cool in theatres in  1984 show their matte lines now on video,  but the movie does harbour some  truly impressive tricks and unsettling dream sequences.  The story itself  is compelling, and the fine cast helps matters along by selling it  brilliantly, and it is a complete treat to see old scenery chewers Von  Sydow and Plummer acting against each other.  Another fine performance  comes from perennial 80's sleazebag David Patrick Kelly as Plummer's dream  assassin, but a weak link is Kate Capshaw's typically wooden performance as  Von Sydow's assistant.For some reason, I had a hard time hunting down  this film, eventually settling for a well-worn rental at the local Mom  & Pop videostore.  But this entertaining SF yarn is well worth the  search, if you can find it possible to see through the shamelessly obvious  Raiders rip-off box cover design.  Interestingly, Capshaw herself would end  up appearing in the second Raiders of the Lost Ark movie, and eventually  become Mrs. Steven Spielberg.  Good thing too, because she really wouldn't  have lasted long as an actress with her painfully stilted acting presence.  But don't lose any sleep over that, ""Dreamscape"" has enough  charm, momentum and surprise to overcome even the worst acting nightmare.",N/A
332597,"I have read a thousand reviews of this work, and the majority of them miss the point. &quot;2001&quot; is, to be sure, a visual and aural banquet, but we should strive to put aside the magnificent special effects and the  hypnotic soundtrack. At the risk of disorienting a worldwide community of  SF buffs, it must be said that this is not a science fiction movie. It is  just a movie about us. Let's calm down and try to discern something of the  true essence of Kubrick's beautiful pictorial essay.A dry, stripped  bone becomes the first murder weapon in the paws of an early hominid. It is  also, of course, the first tool. Pain, and development. Rejoicing, our  ancestor hurls the bone into the air. It soars and then falls, tumbling. We  progress four million years as the rotating bone blends smoothly into the  image of a spacecraft orbiting our planet. Mankind's technological and  cultural advances are astounding. But how far have we really come, what  prices have we paid, and where are we all headed?  Kubrick signals his  intent when we see our first example of modern man, aboard the spacecraft.  The man is asleep. He is detached, and indifferent. What is at the end of  our journey?  A featureless and monolithic slab serves as punctuation in  Kubrick's essay. It is not God, nor is it an alien, and nor is it an alien  artifact. It is just a period placed by Kubrick at the ends of four  chapters. At each fleeting apparition, we witness an ostensibly progressive  transition, typically accompanied by pain. Pain, and development. In the  world of 2001, the distracted energies expended upon increasingly complex  technology have drained our ever-shallow pool of humanity into the very  machines we have made. We have not come very far, even as the essay  persistently takes us further in space, away from the earthly cradle. Dr.  Heywood Floyd, modern man's representative, caresses the monolith on the  lunar surface with a bewilderment reminiscent of that displayed by the  primitive hominids on earth four million years earlier.The culmination  of all our efforts is HAL, a sentient and talkative computer aboard a  (bone-shaped) spaceship en route to the planet Jupiter. HAL has not one  strand of our DNA in his circuits, yet he is the most human of all the  characters inhabiting the landscape of 2001.  During a long and transfixing  sequence in which his CPU is slowly disabled by vacuous astronaut David  Bowman, HAL gently declares &quot;I can feel it...I can feel it&quot;, over  and over again.  At this point in the story we face the prospect of a world  in which humanity (or, at least, human-ness) has been extinguished,  ironically in HAL's red and womb-like CPU chamber. The monolith appears and  completes another chapter.Watch carefully during the wordless final  reel of this unique and superb movie. The conclusion is deliberately vague,  and purposely and endlessly fluid. Perhaps we finish right where we  started, and begin again. It's up to you. Do not look to Clarke's book for  explanation. The novel was written during and after the making of the film  and, as told by Clarke, the movie is 90% Kubrick and 10% Clarke, and vice  versa for the book. By its nature, there is no definitive explanation of  the ending to the movie. For a very long double bill, I would recommend  pairing the film with Tarkovsky's mesmerizing &quot;Solaris&quot; (1971). I  would not recommend &quot;2010&quot; by Hyams (1984), which is a literal,  weak and wooden-headed attempt to extend Kubrick's work. Why meddle with  perfection?",N/A

446320,"The curious thing about this series is that the quality of the movies (i.e. image, cinematography, art direction)as the series progresses gets  steadily worse -- this is clearly a result of the diminishing budget as  pointed out in the behind the scenes documentary.  The ideas, conflict and  philosophy however, grow more and more interesting and profound as the  series progresses.  To put it another way:  The physical quality of the  movies (visuals) is inversely related to the philisophical quality (social  commentaries, issues).  Some of the sets in the later episodes are quite  bad -- sometimes they look like sets from the 60's Batman series...and the  acting isn't much better, however the concepts are nonetheless intriguing  enough that it hold's ones interest.As far as the DVD release of the  transfer is concerned, its clarity and vibrancy is the finest as I have  ever seen this film.  As far as &quot;extras&quot; are concerned the  LIMITED EDITION bonus disc is nice to have. The individual discs don't have  any extras, so if you want behind the scenes footage and anecdotes, you'll  have to get the boxed set of 5 discs plus the bonus disc.  As a bonus it is  fairly substantial in that it is a full length documentary.",Planet of the Apes Collection VHS
429991,"This is the most novel premise for an action movie I've ever seen. Admittedly it may lack something in plausibilty, and a lot of people have vocally complained about this, but I don't really see the problem. This is a great movie, full of inspired acting, brilliant scripting and, more importantly, action. Lots and lots of action. The amount and quality of action only Hong Kong director John Woo could manage. The magnificently choreographed gunfights and artistic use of slow motion make for some of the greatest scenes I've ever seen. Probably the only weak link in the movie is that Nicholas Cage is a much more compelling villain than John Travolta, so it kind of stings to have Castor Troy build up so much momentum that then gets lost once he starts wearing Sean Archer's face. Still, don't be fooled by all the philistines out there. See this movie, you won't regret it.",N/A
524329,"In its story, `Erin Brockovich' breaks little new ground. Essentially, it joins the ranks of earlier films such as `Silkwood,' `The Insider,' `A  Civil Action,' `The Rainmaker,' among others, each of which tells the tale  of a common `David' (be it in the form of a whistleblowing employee or  compassionate, righteous lawyer) who, against all odds, mounts a seemingly  quixotic crusade against a corporate Goliath. All the above five films  expose the shoddy and often malevolent business practices of companies that  have resulted in major health care crises for both their own employees as  well as the residents who live near the companies' facilities. In the case  of `Erin Brockovich,' the villain is the PG&amp;E electrical plant located  in the desert community of Hinckley, near Barstow, California. It seems  that the residents of this small town have been experiencing a  mind-bogglingly high number of serious illnesses and miscarriages that  PG&amp;E has assured them are not in any way related to the activities at  their site. The company has even brought in medical professionals and  toxicologists to assuage the residents' growing fears. Almost by chance,  Erin Brockovich stumbles onto this information and takes up the challenge  of fighting for the rights of these victims and exposing PG&amp;E's gross  malfeasance in the process.Looking at its bare-boned plotting, one must  concede that there really isn't much that is new here. However, thanks to a  pair of utterly smashing performances by Julia Roberts and Albert Finney  and a beautifully well-rounded portrait of a real-life heroine, this Steven  Soderbergh film emerges as a true crowd-pleasing triumph. This may, in  fact, be not only Roberts' best performance, but her finest role as well.  Erin is not a conventional do-gooder heroine. First of all, she is often  abrasive and off-putting in her demeanor. Dressed more like a fashion  devotee of Roberts' `Pretty Woman' call girl character than a serious legal  executive, Erin often launches into unrestrained, obscenity-laced tirades  at her boss, her loving boyfriend, even the corporate lawyer bigwigs sent  to help her when the case she is making comes close to completion. Yet, it  is just this no-nonsense directness that earns her the confidence of the  people she is trying so desperately to help. A twice-divorced mother of  three, she is as passionate in the defense of her own children as she is in  the defense of her case. Yet, she is a woman made up of any number of  internal contradictions. Much as she loves her children, she has made a  shambles of her life in recent years. Rootless and lacking the skills  necessary to procure a well-paying job, she practically has to beg to get  hired in the office of a lawyer who has failed to win her a settlement in a  traffic accident case. Staunchly individualistic, she refuses to tone down  her rhetoric or her temper - or to adopt the more `professional' attire of  the business world - even if it might mean that she would be taken more  seriously by those around her. She assumes that no man would be willing to  consider having a serious relationship with her because of her children and  marital track record, yet, when a man enters her life doing just that, her  insecurities and her intense commitment to the cause for which she is  fighting begin to drive him away - and her children as well. Most  fascinatingly, perhaps, we are led to wonder whether it is really the  suffering people who motivate her obsessive commitment or rather, as she  herself admits, the personal recognition she receives now when she walks  into a room and people clamor desperately to know what she thinks on an  issue. All credit to Susannah Grant for writing a character so full of  believable paradoxes. Obnoxious as Erin is at times, her innate vitality,  wisdom and warm-hearted compassion consistently shine forth. Grant, by  making her such a three-dimensional figure, mitigates much of the  incredibility that lies at the root of this story, true though it may  be.And, given this juicy role, Roberts is nothing short of a revelation.  She conveys each conflicting mood and character trait perfectly. Never  before has this actress brought such a breezy assurance to her every action  and statement. She literally holds this rich film together, forcing us to  focus intently on the storm of emotions taking place deep inside this  complex woman. This is definitely Oscar-caliber work. Equally brilliant is  Albert Finney as Ed Masry, the lawyer for whom Erin works, a jovial,  easygoing man who watches with a bemused appreciation as Erin hurls  colorful invective at him, rages against the system and dresses down with  withering sarcasm not only the legal representatives from PG&amp;E but the  seasoned lawyers Masry himself has hired to help bring home the case. One  of Erin's most endearing traits is that she is an equal opportunity  harridan - a fact that wins Masry over every bit as much as it does  us.If `Erin Brockovich' has a weakness, it comes in the form of Erin's  romantic relationship with the unemployed motorcycle rider next door. He  seems simply too good to be true, and, although we know that it is  necessary to fill in this particular part of Erin's life to make her  portrait a well-rounded and complete one, it is still the least interesting  and believable part of the tale. We feel we are being too often distracted  from the meaty center of the story.Still, this is a minor quibble about  a film that works so beautifully on so many levels. As Erin Brockovich,  Julia Roberts has finally found the role uniquely suited to her enormous  talents and she blazes forth more brightly than she has ever done before.  I, for one, will be roundly rooting for her come Oscar night.",Erin Brockovich VHS
356754,"I'd seen a bunch of Bresson films before I ever heard of Mouchette, and had always regarded him as the director who, while I wouldn't necessarily want to watch his films to the exclusion of anyone else's, speaks to what's  best in me; Bresson's work has an uncompromising directness that no other  film-maker has ever matched, in my experience.  Watching his films, you  feel that something is being imparted to you that you needed to know; in  this respect, he's utterly unlike the vast majority of directors, who seek  merely to provide diversion and laffs.  His influence on Scorsese,  Fassbinder and Kaurismaki is undeniable, and Paul Schrader has blatantly  ripped him off on more than one occasion (though we forgive Schrader  because he is himself such a good director).Mouchette is not the most  famous of Bresson's films but it's one of the best I've seen - though  admittedly this is misleading, as most of Bresson's films after the late  40s are masterpieces.  Mouchette's life is almost unrelentingly awful; her  mother is dying, and most of her verbal contact with Mouchette consists of  orders to look after the baby and get her some more gin; her father takes  whatever money she earns, and her brother never says anything at all.  She  lives in a grotty village in a totally unattractive-looking part of  Provence, where the local boys have nothing better to do than drop their  pants in her direction, and where her sole recreation is throwing mud at  her schoolmates.  Nadine Nortier, one of a string of non-professional  actors to be burdened with carrying a Bresson movie, is stunning as the  teenaged Mouchette.  Few cinematic leading ladies have been so utterly  unglamorous.  Her hair is straggly and greasy-looking, her clothes are  outsized hand-me-downs and her shoes are enormous clogs that clack loudly  as she walks, yet Nortier never loses contact with Mouchette's livid anger  and spiritual dignity.  When professional actresses cry, they tend to  crease up their faces and emote; Nortier stares blankly into the middle  distance as the tears stream down her face.Mouchette is an  extraordinary film, not one to be watched as part of a night of videos,  unless the other videos also happen to be directed by Bresson.  It's one of  Bresson's most unrelentingly sombre films, but the outcome, although  tragic, is not nihilistic (as, arguably, was the director's later study of  disaffected youth, &quot;Le Diable probablement&quot;).  Not a feelgood  movie, but by no means a nothing-means-anything movie, either, which is a  considerable achievement by anyone's standards, and by the standards of  contemporary movies, an outright miracle.",Mouchette VHS

465692,"Perhaps it is a great movie for those who actually know very little about Shakespeare, literature, history and art in general.  I am sure it won the Oscar becuase it's so revoltingly simple and unsophisticated, but  unfortunately, it profanes a serious subject of art and lets an ordinary  person think that now he is familiar with something more subliminal than  his everydy chores.  I guess it has an appeal to masses, otherwise it's  hard to explain why it wins these rave reviewes.  All in all, it's a soap  opera at best, and even the sonnet they selected is the most beaten up  Shakespeare's piece.  The film shows what happens when a theory that art's  purpose is to entertain working people is implemented live...

387977,"I've been watching movies for quite some years now, but it's only been recently, within the last year of so, that I've decided to try to broaden my horizons a bit, and take chances on movies I usually wouldn't watch.  With that in mind, I've started renting some foreign movies, and began picking up movies I had never heard anything about, or starred actors I had never heard of before.  That's how I came to pick up this movie, and I have to admit that overall, I was pleasantly surprised that I enjoyed it as much as I did.  I'm going to try to break the movie down into component parts, the cast, story, and things like that, and what I liked and didn't like about each.To start with, the cast.  As I mentioned, I had never heard of any of the people that starred in this movie, and to be honest, probably will never see them again, or recognize them.  The two lead characters, the two girls who fall in love, did a very credible job with their roles.  Watching them, I have to say I enjoyed watching their performances, and could believe that the two of them could possibly meet one another, find a spark of attraction there, and grow to be lovers.  Some of the supporting characters were a bit weakly played, but not all that bad, except for one in particular who fortunately, only appeared in two very short scenes.  This was the boyfriend of Evie, the African-American girl, who was very stilted in his acting, and never seemed at ease in his role, but then again maybe he was supposed to play him that way.  I don't really know, but I didn't really care for his acting ability.As for the story itself, it unfolded in a very natural way, and the script didn't seem to downplay towards the two girls, or force them to act before they were really ready, which too many teenage lover stories seem to like to do.  As a matter of fact, it's a good half way through the movie before Randy even tells Evie that she would like to hold her hand, and the awkwardness she displays there seems real to life, and further deepened my involvement in the characters lives.  Neither girl is portrayed as being stupid, as a matter of fact, they spend some time reading Walt Whitman's &quot;The Leaves of Grass&quot; to one another, and enjoy it.  By the time they do consummate their relationship, we know the two girls as well as they know each other, and fell glad for them.My main disappointment with the movie was the ending, which seemed kind of slapped on, and changed the mood of the movie.  Prior to it, I was enjoying the burgeoning love relationship the two girls were experiencing, and the end turns into a sort of slapstick farce where everyone introduced earlier in the story are brought together to a hotel where the girls have gone into hiding after having been found out.  It seemed a bit anticlimatic after the story I was enjoying, but not enough so to completely diminish the good feeling raised by the rest of the film.So, all things considered, I would have to recommend this movie to anyone who is looking for something just a little bit different from what you usually watch.  If you are like me, I don't think you will be disappointed.",The Incredibly True Adventures of Two Girls in Love VHS

Last night when I put  the new DVD version in the player I was transfixed from the first scene. I  was seeing this work of cinematic art for the first time. It took hours to  watch the entire film because I kept rewinding to view certain scenes over  and over. The film is simply stunning in ways that the old transfers never  hinted at.

Absolutely amazing since the hero of THE POSTMAN is undoubtedly a brother  of the leading character depicted in DANCES WITH WOLVES, a movie that was a  huge critical success.Kevin Costner is one of the only american  directors who is able to direct an epic nowadays. And THE POSTMAN has it  all : the humble man destined to become a hero, the villain who is very,  very bad, the landscapes, the musical score, the slow-motions at the right  moment, etc. etc...During the projection of THE POSTMAN, I couldn't  refrain myself to think of certain movies of director Howard Hawks. Perhaps  a certain resemblance between Gary Cooper and Kevin Costner or was it  because both directors have given to women important and interesting roles  ? Anyway, there are far worse references than this one, aren't they ?To  make it short, I sincerely think that THE POSTMAN will become a classic in  a few years.

Those of you who have read it, or have seen this movie, will &quot;get&quot; the joke I just made.John Cusack, in my opinion, is not underrated, by the way--he just chooses to do his own thing. Always.  And in this movie, he comes through, as always.  With his sister, the hysterically funny Joan, backing him up, once again.What we have here is a film that is able to stand on its own without the viewer reading the book first, however. It IS slightly darker in style, I think, but the humor that leavened this tale of a hopelessly lost man groping for some sort of anchor in life through his endless reinvestigation of his past, in women and music, still stands as a classic symbol of the type of male who cannot commit to much, and therefore cannot find much happiness in life.Whenever a woman dumps Rob, he rearranges his vast record collection.  Sometimes it will be alphabetical, sometimes it will be genres of music, and once, astoundingly, he  manages to rearrange his collection autobiographically...eg: what he was listening to at different points in different time periods.  hahaha. This is a typical example from the movie of how absurd this &quot;lost soul&quot; is.John Cusack, standing in the rain, looking like a lost dog... wanting an old lover. John Cusack, directly facing the screen, making remarks to us, the viewers, with more energy and insight than he would seem to be capable of, about how he REALLY feels.

They are perfectly portrayed nerds, and yet even they leave him in the dust, ultimately, and find their places in life.As a woman?  I have certainly known guys like &quot;Rob&quot;.  Guys who seem more interested in music, or in loves that eventually dwindle because of no paticular reason.  But as a person, watching this, I certainly held no malice toward Rob.  He hurts only himself as he wends his way through his past and stops short of getting on with growing up.Sort of a funny and sweet feeling to this  movie.  Very little bitterness.  A poignant movie, well directed, well acted.  A loving look ultimately at those guys you gotta love but who can't give you much back except, in Rob's case, a really great tape mix of your affair when it's over.See it for yourself and you will understand the mix of humor and pain that is at the bottom of this gentle obsevation on &quot;guyness&quot;.best,Jean",High Fidelity VHS

The scenery that was at least sort of interesting in Batman Forever now looks silly and stupid (as if people would build highways  around 300 story statues in the middle of a crowded city). The acting is  surprisingly terrible, considering there are some good actors in this  movie. George Clooney makes it obvious that he really doesn't want to be in  any of his scenes (and who would want to, what with the bad dialogue!). Uma  Thurman somehow misfires her wannabe-camp portrayal of the vampy Poison  Ivy; Chris O'Donnell only annoys with his constant whining of cliched lines  like &quot;you're just jealous!&quot;; and Ah-nuld merely spouts  mesmerizingly unfunny one-liners that will just give you a headache. And  poor Alicia Silverstone spends the entire movie trying to look cute with  puppy-dog eyes on overdrive, but it just seems like she's trying too hard  in the end. As for the rest of the movie, the plot is stupid, the villains  mesmerizingly annoying and lacking in the camp value they strive for, and  the movie doesn't even follow up on it's sub-plots!  Elle Macpherson's  here-then-gone character of Bruce Wayne's girlfriend is last seen halfway  through the movie (if you make it that far) presenting Bruce with the marry  me or I'm leaving you ultimatum - and we never see or hear about that  again!  The only resolution you'll get is on the main struggle, after the  overblown final battle - and even that resolution feels stupid.

THE RUSSIANS ARE COMING, THE RUSSIANS ARE COMING, released in 1966.The captain of a Soviet submarine cruising off New England wants a close-up view of forbidden Amerika, so he heads closer and closer inshore despite the frantic warnings from his crew about a rising sea bottom, and he soon finds himself hard aground on an off-shore island. Early the next morning, he orders a landing party ashore under the command of his long-suffering First Officer, Lt. Rozanov, played by Alan Arkin in his first big screen appearance. Their mission, to find a motorboat powerful enough to drag the sub off the shoal. After stealing a car from an isolated beach house, they head off to the island's population center, such as it is,  to look for their tow.Of course, the submariners' quest must be accomplished on the sly since they don't want to be captured and imprisoned as spies. Observed by an early rising old biddy, she manages to get off an agitated report to an incredulous Chief of Police before the phone line is cut. This one warning, overheard by a gossipy switchboard operator, results in a torrent of escalating rumors and frantic running-about as the hastily armed locals become convinced that their island is the beachhead of a full scale Russian invasion of America. As the hysteria mounts, the Russians scurry from one hiding place to the next in an effort to reach the island's main boat anchorage undetected.The cast is superb. Brian Keith plays the level-headed and exasperated Chief of Police, who is fully occupied keeping the local, trigger-happy citizenry under control. Jonathan Winters is his hyperexcitable deputy. Carl Reiner is the head of the family from whom the sailors initially commandeered the car. The film was nominated for Best Picture and Best Actor (Arkin) Oscars, and won two Golden Globes: Best Film (Musical/Comedy) and Best Actor (Musical/Comedy). Arkin won the latter.The final confrontation between the Soviet vessel, its foolish captain, played by Theodore Bikel, and the aroused islanders is a lesson on brinkmanship that deserves to be studied by the world at large. It's also serves as the pi&egrave;ce-de-r&eacute;sistance ending of the funniest movie I've seen ... ever.",N/A
238023,"&quot;Who's That Girl&quot; is one of Madonna's most entertaining pictures to date. Unfortunately, the film was ignored by critics and audiences alike upon its release in the summer of 1987. This was one of Madonna's best  periods. She wrote four outstanding songs for the soundtrack that would  also be ignored by Madonna, herself, in later years. &quot;Who's That  Girl&quot; and &quot;Causing a Commotion&quot; reached No.1 and No.2,  respectively, but they weren't to be found on THE IMMACULATE COLLECTION.  &quot;The Look of Love,&quot; meanwhile, has stood the test of time as one  of her most achingly beautiful ballads, yet she FORGOT to include it on her  ballads collection, SOMETHING TO REMEMBER. Go figure. The picture itself is  a noisy screwball comedy that is hysterically funny. One of the best lines  in the film (and there are many great ones) is &quot;What's the patient's  name?&quot;  &quot;Loudon.&quot;  &quot;Loudon what?&quot;  &quot;Clear.&quot; LOL. It makes me giddy just thinking about it. I should  note, however, that, while WHO'S THAT GIRL is funnier than DESPERATELY  SEEKING SUSAN, it is not a better movie. DSS is still Madonna's best  performance and she is not playing herself in either movie. The only  pictures where Madonna is playing herself are VISION QUEST and TRUTH OR  DARE. Got it?",N/A

When he broke down, so did I. I like the relationship between Brian and Gale. It's not only competitive, but loving. Brian helps Gale back to 100% not only because he wants some competition, but also out of friendship and respect. The two become closer and eventually stand by one another.

527727,"Throughout much of &quot;Hollow Man&quot;, I was reminded of Christopher Marlowe's &quot;Doctor Faustus&quot;, in which the eponymous character  sells his soul to Mephistopholes, only to turn invisible and play practical  jokes on his unsuspecting contemporaries.In &quot;Hollow Man&quot;,  Sebastian Cole (Kevin Bacon) sells his soul to...well, himself...and uses  his newfound power to play practical jokes on his coworkers, albeit  practical jokes of a slightly evil nature.  Instead of robbing a bank, he  tweaks the nipples of the project veterinarian.  Rather than murder Saddam  Hussein, he rapes the woman in the apartment across the hall.  Like Doctor  Faustus before him Cole is as limited in imagination as he is powerful.  This is a profound statement about human greed, in my opinion, but that's  not really what this review is about.At first visually and  Technologically stunning, &quot;Hollow Man&quot; bogs down with what I  think of as &quot;3D Syndrome&quot; - Paul Verhoeven, having the ability to  amaze you with the many different ways to make Cole visible spends the  entire film...making Cole visible.  We see him in water, smoke, fog, mist,  blood.  We see his invisible frame coated with burnt flesh.  By the end of  the film, reason is tossed out the window, exchanged for pure eye candy.Don't get me wrong.  I like eye-candy.  But like any kind of candy, too  much can make you sick.  In the end I felt myself craving substance, a  statement about the tenuous hold we have on morality, something that made  me feel like I was actually watching a movie instead of viewing images in a  particularly gory art gallery.Supporting roles are adequately  played, though the talented cast is given little to do.  Kevin Bacon chews  a lot of scenery as Cole, but inexplicably chooses to play him as a jerk  all the way through, so we feel nothing but relief when he gets his  comeuppance.",N/A
69470,"""Galaxy Quest"" is good goofy fun for anyone and especially for the trekkie or trekker.  Plot:  it's the end of the century and the cast of a 1970s TV show called ""Galaxy Quest"" is so typecast that it has  been reduced to making public appearances like mall openings.  Needless to  say, lots of the fans dress up like aliens.  Turns out one group of fans  are REAL aliens and spirit the crew up to a REAL spaceship that was  designed to mimic the Galaxy Quest spaceship in all (and I mean all)  respects.Don't worry too much about plot loopholes here; just buckle  your belt and enjoy the ride.  Tim Allen is terrific here as the  Shatneresque commander and Sigourney Weaver more than holds her own as the  buxom blonde mate.  Look for Tony Shaloob (of TV's ""Monk"") in a supporting role.  This is definitely a movie to save for  when you're feeling silly, in which case it will really hit the spot.",N/A
471368,"Unfortunatly, this film wasn't quite what I expected. Connery is classically associated with 007, in other words 'the good guy'. Playing a professional thief, didn't really suit his style, having said this, he made the best of it.Catherine Zeta Jones fitted the role of an insurance investigater leading a double life, very well indeed being subtle and athletic thoughout, she breathed life into the film. Having talked about the actors, the film seemed to wallow too much with many of the scenes taking place in some castle in scotland. They ought to have dotted around a bit to keep things interesting. Still, there some scenes (not enough) which contained real suspense and thrilling action. The ending was entirly unconvincing and unrealistic. Although i didn't see it coming, it wasn't in the least bit likely, considing the complete lack of chemistry between the lead actors throughout the film.This, in my opinion is what killed the film, the lack of relationship other than profesional. Mac even put Gin down when she suggested it. In a way it would have been difficult having a romantic intrest because Connery is old enough to be Zeta Jones' grandfather.In conclusion I would say that if you are a die-hard Connery or Zeta jones fan, then it is worth a rent for a mediocre performance by good actors and a topical story line, watch it once then make up your own mind.",Entrapment VHS

495304,"What was I expecting?When I picked up this title, I noticed two things: the words &quot;I spit on your grave&quot; in blood-shot red; and a  scantilly clad lady with a knife in her hand.  I thought, &quot;Well, this  is just one more slasher film.  Probably so bad you'll have to  laugh.&quot;Boy, was I dead wrong.I Spit on Your Grave is one of the  most disturbing, terrifying and thought-provoking movies I have ever seen.  It begins quite peacefully when Jenny (Camille Keaton) arrives in the  country to write a book.  She's rented a cottage by the river.  Pretty,  slender, and from the big city, she catches the eye of four locals.  They  try to catch her attention, but appropriately, she ignores them.Unhappy  that she has refused them, the four decide to teach her a lesson.  One day,  while she is in her little canoe sunning, they come by in a motor boat and  take her away, against her will, to a hidden part of the woods.  I can't  even begin to describe what happens in this movie's next chapter.  All I  will say is that I was horrified, petrified and practically moved to tears.  If you cannot imagine what it is like to be helpless and at other people's  mercy, just watch this movie.One of the four guys orders one of the  others to kill her so she won't witness against them.  Unbeknownst to the  other three, the supposed killer is unable to complete his task.  Presumed  dead by the three, she slowly recovers from her injuries.  Once recovered,  she only has one purpose in her mind and heart.One by one, she plots the  death of her four attackers.  What is amazing in this movie, is that during  each act of revenge, you wonder whether or not she will  succeed.Brilliantly directed and acted, I Spit on Your Grave is a  classic.  Camille Keaton's performance is so stunning the whole thing seems  like it is actually happening.  You just don't get performances like this  from Meryl Streep or Sally Field.  This is raw and real.

119989,"&quot;The Big Sleep&quot; is the second Warner Brothers feature that pairs Humphrey Bogart and Lauren Bacall under the direction of Howard Hawkes. The screenplay of &quot;The Big Sleep&quot; is based on the Raymond Chandler novel and written by William Faulkner (who collaborated with Hawkes in &quot;To Have And Have Not&quot;) and Leigh Brackett. The combination of these artists produced one of the most distinctive motion pictures of the 1940s. Its twisting, non-linear storyline, the fine cast of supporting characters, and its rapid-fire witty dialogue will lead many viewers to watch &quot;The Big Sleep&quot; again and again, discovering something new after each time. Even individual scenes that might have been mere connective elements in other movies are wonderfully embellished. The meeting between Bogart's Philip Marlowe and General Sternwood is pure Faulkner and the witty flirtation between Bogart and the bookseller played by Dorothy Malone is a pure delight. But it is the complicated relationship that develops between Bogart and Bacall and the journey that the viewer travels with Bogart as he untangles the webs of intrigue and deceit that will one will remember most and will want to experience again.The DVD contains the 1946 general release and the 1944/45 prerelease seen mostly by servicemen overseas. If one has never seen &quot;The Big Sleep&quot; before, watch the documentary first, then the prerelease version, and then the 1946 version. In this way, one can see how and why the film evolved into its final form. If you are a fan of film noir, detective stories, Bogey and Bacall, or just great movies in general, make sure this DVD gets into your video library.",N/A
474905,"This kind of subject is fascinating for anyone - for each individual on this Earth there isn't a more important question than 'what happens when you die' - whatever the answer is, its eternal.  If you truly aren't  interested in this question, you're either very young, or have missed the  point of life altogether! :-)If you're hoping for a blood-and-guts  horror film, or have come to see it because you've been pulled in by some  hype-machine, you'll probably be disappointed - its not a horror film, its  a thoughtful, suspenseful story - and there are few films ever made that  can live up to their marketing hype, so don't listen to it!  You'll nearly  always go away feeling ripped-off.&quot;The Sixth Sense&quot; features a  boy, Cole Sear, who is being terrified by visions of the dead, and a child  psychologist, Malcolm Crowe, who tries to help him - in part to exorcise a  failure in his past.  There was another boy that the psycologist had  treated who was haunted, but he failed to help him.We see this boy at  the beginning of the film, now grown into a young man - tortured and  terrified, the boy blames the psychologist for his years of torment... he  had been promised help by the doctor, and had been left to his demons by a  mis-diagnosis of emotional problems by a man who couldn't bring himself to  believe what his child patient was telling him.  The man, standing shaking  in his underwear, pulls out a gun (don't know where he was hiding that!)  and shoots Crowe in the stomach, then puts the gun to his own head and  fires.The next autumn/fall history begins to repeat itself with Crowes  new patient, Cole.  At first he can see no further than the rational,  believing him to be emotionally disturbed because of his parent's  separation - but just as he's about to give up on him, he reviews an audio  recording of an old session (with the boy who would later shoot him), and  comes across a faint voice that couldn't possibly have been there - a  Spanish voice, pleading and begging - &quot;I don't want to die!&quot;  Then begins Crowes attempts to really help the boy, by finding out what  these visitors want - and if there ever can be a way to make them  leave.If this film has one major flaw its that it skips over its subject  too fast.  The boy is supposed to be tortured, but we only ever see a  couple of ghosts - my sister has seen more ghosts than that!  And if  anything, there's no search for the answer to how to make them go away -  Crowe puts his finger on the solution immediately - and then the doctor's  theory is considered proved by just one ghost.That point aside, this is  one of the better films I've seen, simply for its thoughtful speculation of  the nature of ghosts, and the story's clever twists.  This is the kind of  film Twilight Zone fans will love, but maximum-body-count horror film fans  will probably find weak and slow...Be that as it may, the line &quot;I  can see dead people&quot; has got to be a film line destined to be in the  future books of world's greatest film lines!One last thing - to really  see this film  you'll need to watch it twice!",The Sixth Sense VHS

This is a breathtaking movie from beginning to end. Daniel Day-Lewis  portrays the legendary Hawkeye so well, that I think James Fenmore Cooper  would give his approval.  Lewis gives Hawkeye courage and strength, yet  sensitivity when it matters most. Russel Means does a fantastic part as  Chingachgook, and Wes Means as the evil Magua, yet in this story as in the  book, you find out why Magua has turned vicious and cruel.  It is about  time that the background of Magua be told, and not just portrayed as being  evil for no reason. Madeleine Stowe is beautiful in this movie and I don't  blame Hawkeye for falling in love with her so quickly, I would to fall in  love with a woman like that.  The location is fantastic and beautiful, the  music is haunting and well placed, the dress and uniforms of the times are  right on target and the battle scenes are accurate as well. Both the French  and British viewpoints are well received as noble but dangerous enemies,  each trying to get more power in North America.

The presence and charisma of Sean Connery, of course, has always  transformed mediocre films into true spectacles.  Now, delicately introduce the tender and multi-talented Zeta-Jones, and you enjoy a relationship that combines the eloquence of James Stewart and Donna Reed (&quot;It's A Wonderful Life&quot;) with the mesmorizing qualities of Elvis Presley and Ann Margaret (&quot;Viva Las Vegas&quot;).

In  this version, Doc's gotten stuck in the past and tells Marty to leave him  alone - he's content to be inventing things back in the past, though he  must find it frustrating to invent things he can't show anyone - his rule  has always been that when you time-travel, you mustn't do anything to  change the future.Marty ends up back in the wild west in the Delorean,  the very time-machine that needs plutonium to get it moving fast enough to  warp into another time. When he lands, he manages to gouge a hole in the  fuel tank, and eventually he realizes he's not going to find much plutonium  in the Old West.Oh, no!  Are they stuck in the past forever?

The menus, sound quality and other features are also top-notch.While the first two films are by far the best, it's nice to get the whole set and therefore the whole story. Alien 3 is the weakest of the set, abysmal and dark without any shred of hope to it. Aliens is still the strongest film in my opinion with great action, characters and story. The first film still captures that sense of horror and fear better than any other in the series, however. Alien Resurrection is better than most of the critics rated it in my opinion, but it's really a distant third in overall quality.The Aliens universe is a dark, unsympathetic shell in which corporate behemoths hold sway over the masses and human life holds little value. In this dismal setting, the heroism of the series main characters, Ellen Ripley above all, is all the more moving when you consider the odds stacked against them.The Aliens series is great and influential science fiction, a precursor to Bladerunner, taking the shining chrome and bright lasers out of the genre and replacing them with dank, greasy and cramped starship hulls and flamethrowers.

I know I would love this film if I was a very young kid (4-8 years old, maybe). There are plenty of  things to keep children of that age group enthralled.  This film also had a  task of keeping the millions of Star Wars fans who have since grown  up(physically, anyway)interested. This could have been the case but, and I  know that so many fans will never admit this-it didn't succeed. Compare it  to the other episodes all you want.  Sure, all of them have bad acting and  questionable plots but the characters in episodes IV, V, and VI had some  chemistry and you actually cared about them, even after just the first  movie. This movie doesn't have that.  I would have forgiven the  mind-numbingly idiotic Jar Jar Binks (Kids hate him too, don't be fooled),  if there were characters that made you care for them and root for them. At  this point I wouldn't have cared if Darth Maul had miracled himself back to  life at the end and cut everyone in half(the queen, Obi-wan, C3PO, Anakin,  and especially Jar Jar-Off with their heads! ), making for  Highlander-esque continuity. There is a reason that this film competed for  the dubious Rasberry Award for the worst film of the year. That is how the  grown-up world rates this film, but let the kids enjoy their film for now.

The costumes are wonderful, the acting is  wonderful, the special effects are wonderful, and the props, which were  exact replicas of the items which were found on the real Titanic, are  wonderful. The maiden voyage of the doomed Titanic is the setting for the  touching love story about Rose DeWitt Bukator, an unhappily engaged society  girl (Winslet) and Jack Dawson, a poor as a church mouse artistically  gifted drifter (DiCaprio).  It is a story that will touch your heart,  inspire you, move you to tears, and make you ponder over one thought in  particular - the thought that perhaps there was a real life Jack and Rose  aboard the real Titanic.  Perhaps romance blossomed between 2 passengers  during the 4 days prior to the sinking of the vessel, a romance that was  destined never to come to fruitition.  It's a sad thought, isn't it?  And  it is wonderful to see that in such a cynical age, a glorious and beautiful  movie such as this can emerge from the cash for trash rota of Hollywood,  depicting the sinking itself and the loss of so many lives in such a  sensitive, non exploitive way.  For that is really what the story of  Titanic is about - the death of over 1500 passengers and crew, but through  the many books and movies which have documented this tragedy so well for  the past 88 years, they, and the ship itself, have achieved the status of  immortality and will never and should never be forgotten.",Titanic VHS

321908,"Though it doesnt achieve the dramatic heights of &quot;Harlan County, USA&quot; this film is nonetheless a moving and disturbing document of workers and unions in battle with management, organized labor, and themselves.  I have to believe that the person below who cheered the  &quot;crushing victory&quot; of management over people who want &quot;to  earn more for doing less&quot;  was joking.  This is a film about meat  packers, a thoroughly disgusting job if there ever was one, who try to  organize against the Hormel company, which is trying to slash their wages  by $2 (It seems to me like management wants to pay the workers less for  doing more).  Unlike Harlan County, USA, though, the conflict of  this film is mostly within the ranks of labor.  The battle between  international and local unions and between different strategies is what  ultimately undermines the the worker's chances for success.  A cheery film  this is not, but an important one that anyone who cares about our American  system of labor and corporate culture should see, along with Harlan County,  Roger and Me, and Matewan.  Be warned that there are many shots inside the  met packing plant, complete with the evisceration and decapitation of many  many pigs.  It made me very glad I don't eat pork...",N/A
380795,"There were three films centering on the perky, fun-loving beach bunny, Gidget. This was the first and by far the best!!!!!  Pert and pretty Sandra Dee was seventeen and at her liveliest and most appealing when she made this cute little flick. She is absolutely irresistable in the title role, a cute, fun-loving American teenage girl who would rather hit the beach than chase after boys like her other girlfriends. However, when she meets two handsome beachbums, Gidget goes a little boy-crazy herself and experiences first love in the process. This is a warm, charming, and funny movie. I have no doubt that this is the film that made Sandra Dee such a popular star. It's easy to see why she became the idol of so many American girls and boys alike. If you're looking for good, clean and solid fun, then GIDGET is the movie for you!!!!!",Gidget VHS

Anyways while visting her at her work, the Nakatomi Tower a group of terrorits take over the tower, holding the 30 or so workers there hostage. McClane isn't taken bu the hostages and sneaks around throughout the rest of the movie to try and stop the terrorits.

First off let me say that this movie is not very realistic, some of the relationships are, but the comedy is way out of place.  Some of the things  that are meant to be funny are just plain stupid.  I went through all this  teenage stuff just like everyone else, but the stuff here is not realistic,  and the comedy is just not funny.  What's so funny about a someone having  &quot;fun&quot; with a pie or body fluids in a glass of beer (it wasn't  pee).  Another thing is the inconsistant plot.  First off their whole goal  is to have sex and that is the goal of the movie (if you haven't seen it,  stop reading here), then at the end they realise they have morals and  having sex this early would be a mistake, but then they just do it anyway!

This one was definately not at the  top of my list.Despite obvious attempts to make this opus as  heart-pounding as possible, Director Oliver Stone created arguably the most  boring football movie ever made. The opening sequence takes us to the field  during a late-season football game which starts out ok, but after about 30  minutes of jagged film mixed with grunts and crunch sounds I found myself  thinking &quot;get to the point Ollie.&quot; This movie spends WAY too much  time on style. We are presented with montage after montage of football  images past and present during important expositional scenes which are few  and far between. There are more of these excruciating collages during  character introspection which occurs way too often. All the game sequences  are long, drawn out and predictable (I counted at least three slow-motion  spiral passes floating magestically into the air. Please.) And for me to  actually care about the outcome it might to throw at least one likable  character in the mix. It turned out that Stone took two and a half hours to  get to the point.

479178,"Not necessarily Hammer's finest production, Four-Sided Triangle is interesting for its central concept, but a stale plot makes for a mostly dated and anemic film. The writer couldn't seem to make up his mind whether  he wanted to emphasize the Frankenstein elements or be cloying and  sympathetic to the plight of the scientist. The indecision costs the film  dearly, as we end up mostly being bored stiff. Still, it wins a few stars  for being novel for the era. Hammer fans will find little here that  connects to the classics, as this film was produced in 1953, well before  even the earliest hit, The Quatermass Experiment in 1955. There was one  other upshot though, it was directed by Terence Fisher.",Four Sided Triangle

550516,"Words cannot express the thanks I have to the people who made this &quot;Directors Cut&quot; happen.  I have waited a long 12 years for this.  When this film first came out in 1988 I believe I saw it 7 times on the big  screen having fallen in love with everything about it.  As a writer and  actor my own imagination was brought forth ten fold by beautiful visuals  and characterizations and I felt displaced into another world visually,  emotionally and also spiritually. Which to me is the way a film should make  one feel.  Luc Besson has created his masterpiece and should be seen as it  was originally created.  I hope he is still as happy with his film as I am  with it 12 years later.  Jean-Marc Barr is perfect in this defining lead  role.  I have always felt him an under appreciated actor and wish there was  more of him on film. He is exciting to watch. His eyes tell more than any  words can say and I think the director realized this and used it to the  max.  Rosanna Arquette is a little miscast (but fun) and the rest of the  cast is perfect and keeps the story on line.  I don't like to give away the  story so I will not talk about it.  I just want to say to anyone who has  not seen this film. SEE IT! You'll love it and if you do not understand it  or like it then I'm sorry for those who don't. This is a story that goes  deep into the heart and soul of a man and reveals to us the beauty that can  come from those who see beyond our own world.  It also reminds us how  precious and beautiful the sea is and that it should be respected and  protected always. A week before this special directors cut was released on  DVD the film was shown on the big screen in Los Angeles and I was there.  Feeling the same emotional feelings I remembered from the first time I saw  this film.  BRAVO to Luc Besson!...",N/A
127456,"I anxiously awaited this movie's opening in the theaters because since I was in high school I have had a great interest in the horrible tragedy that  took place in the North Atlantic in April 1912.  Being very familiar with  the true story, I was afraid that when this movie came out I would be  seeing a 1997 version of the Poseidon Adventure.  I couldn't have been more  wrong.  First of all, I would like to thank the makers of this film for  going to the actual wreck of the Titanic and filming scenes of areas within  the wreck that hadn't been seen before.  The scenes early in the movie of  this great ship lying on the bottom of the ocean were heart wrenching.  Gloria Stuart was just beautiful as a survivor of the wreck who returned 85  years later to take care of some unfinished business.  The romance, which I  believe was included to basically hold the story together, was pretty much  according to formula and predictable, but you still grow to care about  these people and what happens to them.  But it is more important to  remember this--Jack and Rose were fictional characters who may or may not  have had experiences like those portrayed in the movie.  There were more  than 1500 real people who died when the Titanic sank.  This is especially  poignant in the scene in the movie where we look across the ocean and see  all of the dead, frozen in the icy cold water.  Only one lifeboat went back  to try to help anyone.  And they were too late.  The ending, when Rose  drops the necklace into the ocean, sending it back to the Titanic is a nice  finish.  And I think the treasure hunters/grave robbers in this movie have  learned something in the end.  Maybe more people will learn some day.  Lets  hope.",Titanic VHS
36400,"At first, I was very weary of this movie.  After reading the serial, I felt that Paul Edgecomb should be played by someone very gruff and stern and that John Coffey should be played by someone with a almost mystical  look to them like Djimon Hounsou.  I am also usually skeptical of movies  made from books that I have really enjoyed because usually the movie does  not do the book justice. Upon seeing the movie, I realized that all my  fears were unfounded.  Tom Hanks was perfect casting because though he was  not the gruff man I had invisioned, he could play all the tender parts  really well.  Likewise, Michael Duncan was the perfect Coffey because he  not only physically looked the part, but he could just sap you dry of tears  when he talked.  All in all, this is a great movie, satisfying to those who  have read the book and a good see to those who haven't.  Just remember to  bring tissues, you will need them.",N/A

Non-stop all out from the moment you hit the  play button, a dark rollercoaster ride of guns, violence, shocks and tears.  A kids movie?The highlight is the stunning battle sequence which opens  the movie. Childhood memories literally engraved on my mind were relived as  heroes fall in battle, quite shocking now nevermind when I was 6. The movie  is fantastically paced, its very fast and the soundtrack (a jolly rock  based affair mainly from Stan Bush) will have your adrenalin in overdrive.  It is brutal battle sequences which make this movie more than just a childs  film, the same being true of cartoon films like Watership Down.

448357,"What can you say about &quot;SUMMERTIME&quot; without gushing? It's my favorite film of the 1950's, and probably in my favorite Top 5 films of all time. The scenery is captured with so brilliantly. The plot is so intricate yet simple. The acting runs the range from achingly tender to intensely cathartic. Words just can't do justice to this film---you simply HAVE to experience it. No other way will do...As Katherine Hepburn's character, Jane Hudson*, (*NOTE: NOT &quot;BABY JANE HUDSON&quot;--THAT'S ANOTHER STORY), rolls into Venice on the train, she sums up the way she's put all her dreams in one basket. &quot;Do you think I won't like Venice? But I HAVE to. I've waited and saved up for such a long time to come here. I JUST HAVE TO LIKE IT.&quot; Many people will be able to identify with the feeling of really NEEDING to enjoy the reality of a place they've dreamed of going, when they actually get to their vacation destination.Jane's evolution from an organized, uptight, cautious, bewildered American tourist to a slightly more-relaxed, enlightened, tolerant, fanciful &quot;girl&quot; is the core of the plot, and a delight to follow. Rossano Brazzi, fresh from 1954's &quot;Three Coins In The Fountain&quot; (shot in Rome), is quietly and smolderingly sensual as the lonely, broadminded married man, Renaldo, who appeals to Jane for warmth, togetherness, and understanding.True, some of the lines were risque for the 1950's. When arguing about how she's not just another tourist out for a quick fling abroad, Jane is rebutted by one of the screen's all-time greatest double-entendres. Renaldo defends his perspective of ethics, and his gift of caring, with the classic line, &quot;you [American] tourists...you talk so much of &quot;love&quot;...well, take it--don't &quot;talk&quot; it!Especially wonderful (and notable) is the scene in which Jane accidentally falls into a canal. Unfortunately, Katherine Hepburn did not completely close one of her eyes during the shooting of this scene, and she developed an optical infection, from the polluted water, which has affected the eye ever since.Some comic relief is provided in the form of Mauro, a school-age street urchin, wise WAY beyond his years. When not trying to sell Jane nudie postcards or hustle her for cigarettes, his sensitivity and insight mirrors Renaldo's. In a way, Mauro's presence helps Jane understand both men are not inherently &quot;bad,&quot; just a product of their current-day culture and exposure. Mauro is right when he notes, &quot;...you nice la-dee, but, inside, I think you cry...&quot;The final scene, when Mauro gives Jane a pen he bought with HIS OWN MONEY gets to me every time....AND I WILL NEVER BE ABLE TO THINK OF A GARDENIA ANY OTHER WAY...",N/A

508699,"A powerful biography of the brilliant but doomed night-club comedian Lenny Bruce. Taking the form of a pseudo documentary, an unseen interviewer questions Bruce's wife, mother, and agent about his life. We are shown  Bruce's early 50's beginnings as an unremarkable comic performing hackneyed  material. He then meets Honey Harlow, the stripper who becomes his wife.  Their marriage is happy at first. Then they get involved with drugs and  swinging, which cause problems and they eventually divorce. This first half  of the film uses the effective technique of frequently cutting to one of  Bruce's later performances to illustrate how these experiences inspired  some of his routines. Meanwhile, during a period working as an MC in strip  joints, Bruce develops the improvisational style for which he became  famous. He moves back to the nigh-clubs, wher his daring satire brings him  acclaim and (initially) fortune. Eventually the authorities take notice,  and he is subjected to a string of busts for obscenity and drugs, which  make it increasingly difficult to get work. Bruce's legal and money  problems pile up, and he finally dies of a drugs overdose. In some ways  then, Lenny is a typical Hollywood rags-to-riches-to-rags biopic, but here  spiced up with a liberal dose of 70's permissiveness. Its sparse Black and  white photography effectively compliments Bruce's increasing despair. The  supporting cast are all good, and Valerie Perrine is particularly strong as  Bruce's wife. But it is Dustin Hoffman who dominates the film. His  performance as Bruce is compelling, especially in the night-club scenes.  Precious little film exists of the real Lenny Bruce in live performance.  Watching Hoffman recreate his routines is the next best thing. For that  alone, this film is to be commended.",Lenny VHS

A smart, tightly woven plot centering on the investigation of a Satanist's quest for revenge against doubters and his detractors, is at the core of this timeless B&amp;W film.

The real truth is that Reeves does not make a great villian. He may be torturing these women, but all you can help to think is that you saw him in Bill and Teds Excellent Adventure. You do not want to see Bill, or was he Ted, strangling a woman. You do not want to see anyone doing that. We, the movie going public, have seen these formulaic acts of violence committed numerous times, by now they just lose any merit and originality. This film should have tried to be original. Instead it is just a retread of many films we have seen before.",The Watcher
306522,"Given its setting of sundry characters en route to Germany from Mexico, this film could have easily degenerated into something predictable, mawkish and trite. Instead, it is a truly fabulous cinematic work, with  flesh-and-blood characers whose various predicaments, interwoven against  the burgeoning Nazi sentiment of the early 1930s, grab the viewer from the  very start. As Glocken, the &quot;little person&quot; who delivers a  welcoming narrative, said: there's a ball player, a doctor, dog lovers,  emancipated ladies and others whose assorted problems unravel themselves  and somehow get resolved through the weeks of the sea journey. Simone  Signoret and Oskar Werner deliver bravura performances as doomed lovers,  while middle-aged disillusioned socialite Vivien Leigh turns in a  wonderfully tart portrayal of a  closet romantic hidden beneath a sarcastic  facade. Lee Marvin is also good as a rough, contemptible athlete whose  unmannerly words and actions manage to alienate just about everone on  board. The film's theme music, while limited to a few scenes, is also  hauntingly poignant. Don't miss this one!",N/A

313179,"Director/writer Mike Leigh's working methods are, by now, legendary.  He customarily gathers his hand-chosen cast well before filming begins to flesh out characters on their own based on his outline of events and then  encourages improvisation to allow the performer to inhabit the character,  rather than a stock, lifeless portrayal.  The actors aren't the only ones  to benefit from this theatre-like approach to filmmaking; Leigh's core  audiences eagerly await each entry to his already estimable canon with  great anticipation.  While SECRETS AND LIES is more dramatic and TOPSY  TURVY more cinematic, for me LIFE IS SWEET is the most memorable of his  films.  Perhaps its the sweet, world-weary musical score from the wonderful  Rachel Portman.  Or the concentration on just a few days in the lives of a  working-class British family and their small circle of friends.  Not to  mention the miraculous performances of Jane Horrocks as the anguished  Nicola--half of a twin sister set (the sublimely droll Claire Skinner is  her offset) and the triumphant, life-affirming work of Alison Steadman  (Leigh's real-life spouse) as Wendy, the earth-mother with seemingly  limitless patience.  Since this film, Jim Broadbent, Timothy Spall, David  Thewlis, and Stephen Rea have gone on to great successes in films like  ENCHANTED APRIL, THE CRYING GAME, NAKED, SHOOTING THE PAST, BULLETS OVER  BROADWAY, and TOPSY-TURVY, establishing themselves as invaluable players in  modern cinema, whether in lead or supporting roles.LIFE IS SWEET may  seem to not &quot;go anywhere&quot; in modern terms, but look closely and  the delightful, profoundly moving rewards will suprise you and no doubt  lead to repeated viewings, even if just to enjoy Ms Steadman's infectious  laugh.

68028,"If your idea of an entertaining evening is spending two hours with an obnoxious, self-absorbed pair of dolts, you might consider this inexcusable film from Rob Reiner. Overacted, overbaked, and not for one moment  convincing (the two are married only out of the script's necessity, not  because they could ever realistically be in love), the film presents scene  after scene of awkward dialogue and situations that literally go nowhere.  It might be a portrait of modern marriage in that the participants are  childish boors with little on their minds but &quot;esteem&quot; and  &quot;fulfillment,&quot; but Reiner fails to present their dilemma in an  interesting way. And what about that final scene? Yes, here is another case  of a spectacle that has to be seen to be believed. Both phony and  over-the-top in its sentimentality, the closing speech rambles on for what  seems like hours. The only saving grace? The lyrics to an Eric Clapton song  that plays during the film: &quot;I'm sorry, I hurt you,&quot; he says.  Thank you Mr. Reiner, we accept your apology.",N/A

67920,"I was prepared to like this film before I saw it, given the extraordinary critical acclaim it drew. But I was unprepared for the emotional wallop of the characterizations: Kevin Spacey and Annette Bening give two of the most  brilliant performances I've ever seen, as the severely dysfunctional couple  whose marriage is unravelling. The lesser roles are played to perfection:  Thora Birch as their angry and confused daughter; Mena Suvari as her  seductive and self-absorbed girlfriend, for whom Spacey develops a driving  obsession; Wes Bentley as her next door neighbor, who maintains a lucrative  business in illicit drugs to support his obsession with filming everything  around him, including the daughter, who becomes his lover. Chris Cooper  plays the boyfriend's brutal Marine father, oblivious to what is going on  around him. It would be a shame to discuss the plot and spoil its many  unexpected twists and turns, but this film draws you in deeper and deeper  into the growing tension and alienation of Spacey and Bening's marriage, as  the teenagers struggle to find the &quot;beauty in life&quot; that gives  the film its title, and Bentley attempts to capture with his camera. You  may have some trouble accepting the fact that a drug-dealer is the sanest  character in this film, but that's an indication of how severely alienated  the characters are. Spacey's announcement in the first few minutes that  &quot;In less than a year, I'll be dead,&quot; makes his character's  gradually evolving self-acceptance all the more emotionally  heart-wrenching.. This is the kind of film that should be seen several  times, to pick up the subtleties you miss while being riveted by the  performances at first viewing. Definitely one of the most original and  unforgettable films of recent years.",Belleza Americana American Beauty  VHS
30904,"The 2 factors contributing to this movie's greatness are: 1) A dynamite script and 2) Superb direction of the actors.  P.T. Anderson brings performances of a lifetime out of such otherwise fairly limited actors as  Burt Reynolds and Mark Wahlberg.Throughout the movie, Anderson also  manages to squeeze in poetic vignettes that take the viewer out of the  mad-dash-to-get-to-the-third-act method that is so prevalent in Hollywood  narratives.  These moments he provides include Philip Seymour Hoffman's  self-hatred, Julianne Moore's distress, and Don Cheadle's moment in the  donut shop.  Please note that although the Hollywood Reporter classified  this film as a 'comedy', to me it's more of a tragedy, but it's definitely  an all-round drama, comparable in tone to a Goodfellas or Casino.",N/A
46853,"The really great movies evoke different reactions with each new viewing, as if somehow absorbing our intervening life experiences and sharing insights we'd not noticed before. &quot;The Devil Is A Woman&quot; is one  of those films. Ten, or even five years ago, I might have admired it's  &quot;camp&quot; stylized value, and let it go at that, but this 1935  classic offers much beyond the surface glitter (although you could spend  ten years just wallowing in that). Sternberg took the well-worn formula of  a hundred pre-code sex dramas (many of them generated at his own Paramount  studio) and replayed it against the never-never land of his own creation  --- a grown-up fairy tale where he could explore modern day relationship  wars (including his own with Dietrich) in such a way as was never before  attempted, and certainly has not been since. The setting is gloriously  unreal, but the dramatic situation is a universal one, and time has not  diminished it's power --- never has the theme of romantic obsession been so  compellingly depicted --- and who but Sternberg could bring such visual  magic to it's telling? To laugh at a film such as this is to miss the point  entirely --- Sternberg and his incomparable cast of players knew exactly  what they were doing --- and it's the sheer boldness of his unique approach  that makes Sterberg an artist for the ages --- not only in his direction,  but also in the fact that he is the credited cinematographer. You could  blow up any frame of this movie and hang it on the wall. This video is an  absolute must --- you'll revisit it often --- and each time come away with  something new.",The Devil Is a Woman VHS
68844,"Do you know how you come across those people who are so graceful, so exuberant, &amp; so amzing that they make most people seem like zombies? Well that's what this movie does to other films. This is a film desperately  in love with being alive. Every camera shot, every sound effect, every  close-up seems to give the viewer a new perspective, a new take on life.  For me it's one of those life-changing things.The story is somewhat  heavy-handed in parts: the director never really gives you a realistic  Japanese perspective on the horror of being ripped from their homes &amp;  being sent to relocation camps (and, frankly, given that 40 million people  died in WWII &amp; tens of millions more lost everything they owned, it  seems almost miniscule). And while the prosecution's closing argument  basically amounts to 'convict him because he's Japanese', the defense's  closing argument seems equally inept: 'acquit him because he's  Japanese.'But these are minor issues indeed. The story moves past these  quickly and makes a far better argument against prejudice in the  protagonist's personal story. And IT IS an amazing story.",N/A
130208,"I saw this movie in the theater.  You must be either a Star Trek fan, or someone that can appreciate those who have enthusiasm towards what they believe in.  The movie does a great job at not poking fun at any of the characters, and some are extreme.  My favorite moment was when the Dentist and his Wife were being interviewed, and he stated he wanted to have plastic surgery to have Vulcan ears.  This was the first time his wife heard this, and she was not amused.While the movie isn't high on budget it is high on compassion for Star Trek fans, and their expression of their love of the show.  Many of us are closet Star Trek fans, who do not realize our dept of the love of the show.

Where are the goodies that seem to come standard with other films on DVD?  Where's the interviews, behind-the-scenes trivia, edited scenes?  This movie is 15 years old and still being played all over cable channels day in and day out, and its popularity hasn't waned a bit!  I got my copy for Christmas and couldn't wait to get it into my DVD player, figuring the music would sound amazing and there would be plenty of extras.  WRONG!The sound is weak; I can't understand why Universal didn't repackage this with stereo sound.  Because of the way this was shot, the movie retains a TV-look about it, but the images are clear and sharp.  You'll still enjoy the movie, but if you were drooling over the DVD for the possibility of bonuses, you'll be sorry.I'm so disappointed with the DVD release...

453144,"Since I first saw the original movie, I have been a diehard fan of The Parent Trap.  When I heard Disney was remaking the film, I thought why mess with a classic.  I must say, though, that this Parent Trap is a classic as  well.  Yes, some things from the original did not survive (such as the  wonderful chemistry between the parents, the entire &quot;Let's Get  Together&quot; sequence, and the lovable Reverend Mosby); however, some  aspects were greatly improved upon (the accents, the perfectly evil fiance,  and the relationships between the twins and their butlers).  Most  importantly, the later version maintains the essence of the original story,  that of twin girls scheming to reunite their divorced parents.  Besides  these pluses, the movie is perfectly cast, the music is wonderful, and the  scenery is lovely.My four-year-old would watch this movie everyday, if I  allowed her too.  It is a great movie for the entire family.  Even though  it is about girls, boys (my husband included) enjoy watching the movie as  much as girls do.  The only bad thing about this movie and the original,  too, is that it gives hope to many divorced children that their parents  will be reunited.  For some children though, they need that hope.My  advice is to buy this movie as well as the original.  If you can pick a  favorite of the two, you must be a more decisive person than I am.",The Parent Trap Walt Disney Pictures Presents  VHS

165066,"Stanley Kubrick's acclaimed dark comedy about nuclear holocaust is among  the greatest film satires ever produced.  To truly appreciate this film it  is necessary to remember its historical context.  It was produced right  after President Kennedy was assassinated and just two years after the Cuban  Missile Crisis.  The whole world was gripped with a profound paranoia about  nuclear annihilation.  Average Americans were spending their life savings  to build bomb shelters in their basements.A strong anti nuke sentiment  was building in the U.S. and anti-nuke protests abounded.  This film was  one of two anti-nuke movies made in 1964.  The other was ""Fail Safe""  starring Henry Fonda and Walter Matthau which was a heavy handed drama that  depicted an accidental breakdown of the Fail Safe system that resulted in a  nuclear attack on Russia.  ""Fail Safe"" conveyed its anti war message  through a realistic dramatization of an accidental war that frightened the  most cavalier of viewers.  ""Strangelove"" accomplished its purpose through  brilliant satire, turning strident generals and politicians into absurd  caricatures.  The dire nature of the topic at a time when real fear was at  its height produced a catharsis that made this film even funnier when it  was first released than it is today.Kubrick's direction was nothing  short of genius.  The film is laced with so many subtle innuendoes and  ironies; one could see it twenty times and still not find them all.  For  instance, most of the names had sexual connotations.  Strangelove  (perversion), Mandrake (a root to used to promote conception), Merkin  (slang for female genitalia) Muffley (same), Buck (stud) Turgidson  (distended with swelling).  The battle to take over the air force complex  took place with a sign that said, ""Peace Is Our Profession"" in the  background.  Then there is President Muffley's great line, ""You can't fight  in here, this is the War Room!""The entire ensemble gave superlative  performances.  Peter Sellers was marvelous playing three parts.  As the  President, he was deadpan and serious while delivering one hilarious line  after another.  As Mandrake, he was the gentlemanly Brit trying nervously  to reason with a madman.  Finally, his best performance was as Dr.  Strangelove, a crippled immigrant German scientist who kept inadvertently  calling the President, ""Mein Fuhrer"".  This was Sellers at his zaniest, and  it was some of the best physical comedy I've ever seen.George C. Scott  was perfect as the gung ho war hawk.  He brayed, strutted, and played the  butt kicking military man to the hilt and beyond.  This part was a  harbinger of his most famous role as Patton, where he played essentially  the same character without the tongue in cheek embellishments.  And who can  forget Slim Pickens, who is shown on the cover of the video box riding the  nuke to ground zero in one of the funniest and most famous scenes in the  history of film.This is one of the most creative, witty and effective  lampoons ever done.  It makes its point effectively by poking fun at people  who take themselves all too seriously, and by making us laugh at that of  which we are most afraid.  I rated it a perfect 10.

SENSE is compelling and spooky, but it's Osment that  makes the film fly.  The film leaves one with a haunting poignancy, thanks  to M. Night's restrained direction, the ensemble's acting, and Newton  Howard's score.  Films such as SIESTA (1987), AN OCCURRENCE AT OWL CREEK  BRIDGE (1959?) and JACOB'S LADDER (1986) have explored this territory with  different results, and more than a smidgen has been borrowed from Roeg's  DON'T LOOK NOW (1973).",The Sixth Sense VHS

452476,"Because I'm a collector of the Criterion DVD series, I felt  &quot;obligated&quot; to buy this release.  Even after watching both discs  (the film disc + the supplement disc), I still cannot understand why  Criterion would pick this particular film out of the thousands of classic  movies that are available worldwide and which are infinitely better than  this drivel.  I will admit that the movie does have some suspense and the  special effects are fantastic.  But the movie is bogged down by glaring  script errors, predictable plot, unnecessary vulgarity, and some downright  terrible acting (and in Liv Tyler's case, complete lack of acting talent).  The added footage doesn't help...it just makes the whole miserable thing  longer!  The commentary tracks are interesting, but not spectacular or  particularly eye-opening.  The booklet that is enclosed with the DVD  contains an essay by Jeanine Basinger, director Michael Bay's former Film  Studies Professor at Wesleyan Univerasity.  How she gushes on about the  film is a definite sign that she probably hasn't seen the movie herself and  that she must have been paid a hefty sum for writing that saccharine.  As  far as the Criterion &quot;extras&quot; are concerned, you shouldn't really  bother unless you're an ardent film buff whose life is dedicated to movies  in every way or a Criterion series collector.  The material is very good  and interesting (with a couple of exceptions), but once you've seen it,  it's enough.  The famous gag reel earns its name well: not only is it  unfunny, but it's outrageously vulgar (I'm no prude, but must one be so  filthy so much of the time?!), and reinforces the fact that many of today's  movie &quot;stars&quot; don't know the meaning of the word.  One look at  the compilation of deleted scenes and you'll clearly know why they were  deleted.  The segments on visual effects, storyboards, and production  design are excellent and definitely up to usual first-rate Criterion  standards.  Movie theater trailers and TV ads are included, and they're an  interesting diversion but nothing more.  The Aerosmith music video &quot;I  Don't Want To Miss A Thing&quot; is included, and is definitely better  heard than seen.  In summary, if you *must* have Armageddon on DVD, I'd  suggest the standard edition:  it's shorter (you can thank me later) and it  costs a lot less.  But if you think long enough, you'll easily come up with  dozens of movies that are much worthier of your time and money.",Armageddon VHS
535138,guy ritchie is very talented and can make a quick pound on the multiplex market but the aim of this game after breaking the ice is to leave us with something that can linger. and riggle into a classic spot. sure for the moment he is setting the pace but if this is the pace then the film industry is going to speed up hollywood already churns out more crap then a elephant with diahorrea.  we all saw the explosion that almost devoured tarrantino crime thrillers with strange subplots conversation and sickly humour almost killing the market. this month alone i have seen four ritchie inspired gore fests involving a lot of old british television and film actors dressed in italian suits and using excessive violence and unfunny dialogue the worst being gangster no 1 and i dont think that there can be a second best the other ray winstone filled thrillers hold no weight. this is a great movie if only ritchie exposed this to the world first it appears as though he has just altered the major points and characters in the script and the fact that he has used the cast from lock stock just to show his love of familiar faces too woo the audience just represents the shadow that the first film has cast. guy has been whirled into a world of bright lights and movie premieres but the best work produced in the majority of art be it film paint or the even the written word is when you try to break new ground and try other directions. financially a sucess it keeps the young men happy but if ritchie wants the mountain he cant use a plane he has got to use the pathway.,Snatch

378111,"Joseph Campbell is a man that I often look to as one of my mentors and I have very few persons that I put in this category.  A man of vision, unpretentious, strong in his convictions but compassionate in our journey into the unconscious.In Joseph Campbell's association with George Lucas in the ""Star Wars Trilogy"", we can experience the plight of our humanity, birth, death and resurrection.  We are all heroes if we can experience this transformation.  This is not an easy journey and we can choose to go through these stages or at times we are forced to take these steps.  It is more painful to be unprepared for a change in our lives and Joseph Campbell helps us to focus on the small things so that we can be prepared for the larger changes.Sooner or later we have to face up to our unconscious.  We have to detach ourselves from ourselves and not take things at face value.  There is so much more that needs to be experienced and dealt with so that we can transcend to our next life.  We have to die to our ego and look inward in our deepest self because this is where and what we are made of;  not our successes in our jobs, not the way we look on the outside, not our money, our prestigious homes and cars, these things shall pass away but our soul/spirit shall live forever.We need to find the courage to change the things we can and let go and accept the things that we cannot change and ask God to give us the wisdom to know the difference.Other books that I would recommend are Morton Kelsey's ""The Other Side of Silence: Meditation for the Twenty-First Century (Revised)"" and Carl Jung's ""Memories, Dreams, Reflections"".

329223,"&quot;...we gotta get this country off of welfare. Back our boys in Vietnam. Show the world we'll fight for freedom. But does anybody give a good goddamn?...&quot;  -Title Song from  &quot;Joe&quot;Peter Boyle's debut as the bigoted hard-hat Joe Curran  should send a message that is as pivotal now as it was back in 1970- racism  and hatred of counterculture are simply signs of confusion of the times we  live in. His emotional depth that he puts in his role was more than  Oscar-worthy, simply because he was a man of limited emotion and limited  feeling. Joe Curran, one of cinema's first anti-heroes, is a lovable and  favored character trapped in the walls of his frustrations. He was a man  who needed an escape from his blue-collar existence. This is why we  empathize with his flag-waving, freedom-loving persona.&quot;Joe,&quot; adapted from Norman's Wexler's worthy script, was a  sleeper hit back in its initial release and a personal triumph to all  involved (specifically director, John G. Avildsen, and actress, Susan  Sarandon) and rocketed them all to stardom. To put it simple, the film is a  swan song in waiting about the complex blue collar view of the hippie  generation of the 1960's, actually being a film suitable for any  counterculture generation. It shows how often confused past generations are  with new lifestyles and fads, etc. This is an excellent film that is worthy  of being a favorite of mine for years to come. It is a shame that it is has  long since faded from memory. Although I somewhat differ from his opinions  and idiosyncrasies, I love Joe Curran in my own way that is different from  any character-audience relationship-- simply because he doesn't force the  charm on his audience... and this is helped by John G. Avildsen's  thoughtful connection. His charcter is what part of makes the final image  haunting.The story is of wealthy advertising executive William  Compton (Dennis Patrick) who murders his daughter's hippie-druggie  boyfriend (Patrick MacDermot)for turning her onto drugs and overdoses her  on speed- resulting in her hospitalization. Leaving from their hip,  low-class apartment (disgraceful for their bourgeoise existence), he meets  Joe Curran (Peter Boyle) in a bar. He listens to Joe preach to a bored  bartender about his racist and anti-hippie views. He identifies with it and  catches Joe's ear. When Joe finds that Bill actually murdered someone, he  takes him under his wing and they become unlikely friends. When Bill's  daughter (Susan Sarandon) finds out that her father murdered her boyfriend,  she goes missing in Greenwich Village. Joe now becomes obsessed with  helping him find her (after a rather humorous dinner sequence involving  Joe, Bill, and their wives). Their search takes them to a marijuana party  that later results in violence.This is a movie that our golden boy,  Oscar, totally and unfairly ignored and underrated. These performances in  &quot;Joe&quot; are top notch and tour de force and the direction is just  as effective, even more than the 1970 winner &quot;Patton.&quot; It was  terribly and brutally underrated at the Academy Awards which is a shame.  This is a beautiful film. Simply and lovingly accomplished. I loved it. It  boils over in its humor (&quot;Stop it, for Chrissake, you'd think the Pope  was comin'&quot;) and steaming social commentary. It would be a noble  gesture to restore it and release it to DVD. Putting it bluntly, it needs  more attention and more of a following. 1970 was awarded with this fine  gem.This is the #2 film on my Top Ten list and Amazon.com has an asset  with this sprawling &quot;epic.&quot; A 10!&quot;Hey Joe!

524215,"Julia Roberts and Albert Finney bring a nonsexual chemistry to the screen that crackles with humor, grit, and raw determination.  The effortless  acting drew me into this David and Goliath-type story as Brockovich takes  on PG&amp;E.Brockovich, a single mother, starts off in a survival  mode, trying to pay the bills and provide for her kids, but when her  straight forward personality lands her in the thick of ethical violations  by PG&amp;E, she can't help but fight for the victims.  Her ability to  relate to these people is the axis on which the impending lawsuit turns;  her ability to weasel her way into her boss's fatherly heart enables her to  continue in a fight many would've deemed hopeless.The humor was  effective throughout, softening me for the emotional scenes--directed with  subtlety by Steven Soderburgh.  The up and down relationship between  George, a neighboring biker, and Brockovich adds depth to her struggles and  emotions.Sure, the movie has a lot of foul language, but it's an honest  depiction of a real woman, and it's hard to imagine her pushing her way to  the top of this dog-heap without just such grittiness.  She pulls no  punches, and neither does this movie. Don't miss it!",Erin Brockovich VHS

479364,"I have been playing organized ice hockey for 13 of the 17 years that I have been alive.  Of all the hockey initiated films that I have seen, Mystery, Alaska is the most accurate.  The lives of the hockey players in the movie are just like my true life and my life is sad.  At about the age of 14, hockey becomes very vicious, brutal and intimidating.  A lot of my teammates were dirty goons who only played the sport for it's open violence and, off the ice were sex obsessed.  This is just how the movie is portrayed and that's just what hockey is like.  It isn't a topic that should have been made into a movie unless it was proving a point. It doesn't tell in any way, tell that the greatness at all levels of hockey is diminishing, but it is.  Soon enough, it won't even be a sport anymore. This movie just repeats the sad truth.  It is damned sad that most players either don't care about anything but hockey, or don't give enough respect to the sport. Mystery, Alaska reinstates this and by making this movie, they worsened the chance of hockey shaping up.  As for the plot, the pond game was boring and having the heroes lose didn't give it any kind of original cleverness or genius ending.  This movie is a shame.",Mystery Alaska VHS

410111,"This is my second favorite action film ever next to The Matrix. I agree with the two other people who said this. The Rock has many excelllent things abut it. One is acting. Nicolas Cage is at his best here. He plays  chemical weapons expert Stanley Goodspeed who goes along with a group of  Navy SEALS to neutralize several VX poison gas rockets and take over  Alcatraz a.k.a The Rock. Sean Connery does an excellent job also and in my  opinion, does the best job of acting in this movie. He is British spy John  Mason whom the Americans have held illegally in a prison for over 3O years.  He is the only man to have ever escaped from Alcatraz. He goes along with  Cage and the SEALS. However, if you want to see better slightly Sean  Connery, check out Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade or some of his OO7  films such as Thunderball, Goldfinger, From Russia with Love, or You Only  Live Twice. Ed Harris does a great job as mentally disgruntled General  Hummel. He holds San Francisco  hostage and if the U.S. government does not  pay money to his dead soldiers' families, he will fire the rockets.  However, he ends up messing up the launch coordinates so the rocket goes  into the sea. He gets killed by one his own men. The action is very  spectacular in this film. There are several hand-to-hand fights and  gunfights at Alcatraz and a great car chase through San Francisco. Another  great thing is music. I loved the background music in this. This is a great  action movie. If you want to see other great action films, check out The  Matrix, Con Air, Air Force One, Crimson Tide, or Face/Off.",The Rock VHS

It's the stare, the leathery skin, the level tone of voice that could reassure a tax  cheat. In Volcano, the guy not only gets to save a city, but he also finds  the time to be one helluva dad. As city official Mike Roark, Jones evokes  the kind of serenity and persuasiveness that turns catastrophes into  miracles. I wonder if he'd consider adopting me.A metropolis gone mad  confronts the head of the O.E.M. (Office of Emergency Management). Roark is  a St. Louis boy and looks rather at out of his element when the La Brea tar  pits begin billowing buckets of steam. Geologist Amy Barnes (Anne Heche)  plays nothing but concern, particularly after a fellow scientist is  virtually swallowed by red gunk pouring from the earth's core. Naturally,  Roark and Barnes team up to try and curb the lethal liquid, but Roark's  teenage daughter is in peril and the career man must quickly decide which  responsibility he'll deal with first.This latest lava-charged  disaster flick proves once and for all that L.A. is no place for sane  people. Forget the flash floods, mud slides, forest fires and occasional  race riots. You ain't seen nothin' until you watch a fire truck melt into  the molten surf on Wilshire Boulevard.Volcano's special effects are  fab--a combo of model work and computer imaging; the story is unremarkable  but solid.

479509,"From ELEPHANT MAN to SAILOR AND LULA and from ERASERHEAD to TWIN PEAKS, director David Lynch has written some of the most intriguing pages of modern cinema. So I was a little puzzled after having seen THE STRAIGHT STORY, a movie David Lynch shot in the autumn of 1998 in Iowa and Wisconsin. Apart of the first travelling of the movie and an accident scene shot in a subjective manner through Alvin's eyes, the movie adopts a very classic form. Obviously, David Lynch didn't want us to be distracted from the story he chose to film.Now, is there any substance in this story of an old man deciding to visit his brother by driving an unusually slow vehicle ? Of course, yes. The theme of the redemptive trip can been found in thousand of books and naturally in most of the road movies shot since the sixties. But, in my opinion, what makes THE STRAIGHT STORY strange and truly original is Alvin's idea that if he can make it, his brother will be still alive on his arrival. The trip is not only redemptive for Alvin and his conscience, it is also magic. And I'm intimately convinced that this is the theme which has seduced David Lynch, mystic among the mystics.Sissy Spacek proves once more that she is a very talented actress in THE STRAIGHT STORY and the only reason I give only three stars to this movie is that I would have liked a little more madness in the treatment of this unusual story.Be advised that this review is about the DVD zone 2 I've bought at Amazon.fr.

179421,"This, I have to say is one of the most realistic, exciting movies I have ever seen! The entire movie fits together like a puzzle. It would not fit so perfectly if the stories weren't out of order.  Travolta and Jackson play two hitmen, Vincent and Jules, Vincent takes Mia, their boss' wife on a date that goes horribly wrong. While on the other hand, jules decides to stop doing hits and live his life pure.  Then thurman plays Mia, Marcellus Wallace's wife, their boss. Bruce Willis plays Butch a boxer that was payed to throw a fight by Marcellus Wallace, but doesn't.  Harvey Keitel is the wolf an expert on disposing of dirty little secrets. Confused? Don't be. Quentin Terrantino did a great job of writing as well as directing. The directing although unorthodox is superb.

460337,"&quot;A Bug's Life&quot; is a fantastic movie, full of comedy, drama, and charm.  You feel for those poor ants and you can't help but cheer them on.  But, wait a minute...the Disney plagiarism machine is at work yet again!  After all the flak that Disney endured because its movie &quot;The Lion  King&quot; was so similar to the Japanese animation classic &quot;Leo The  Lion&quot;, you'd think they'd have learned their lesson.  Well, they  haven't.This time, Disney &amp; Friends have decided to rip off  ANOTHER Japanese classic movie, albeit a rather obscure one to the average  modern American movie audience.  Their plagiaristic target?  The 1957  classic &quot;Seven Samurai&quot; --later remade into the American film  &quot;The Magnificent Seven&quot;.  In this movie, a village of farmers  (Disney's ants) is under threat of pillage from the countryside-roaming  bandits (Disney's grasshoppers).  So the village dispatches a few of its  residents (Disney's Flik) to the nearest town to enlist the help of brave  samurai (Disney's big bugs).  Although there are a few plot changes,  probably just so Disney can stay one step ahead of a copyright infringement  lawsuit, the big bugs eventually help defend the village from the attackers  and all ends well.Despite all the story-stealing, Disney has managed  to produce a visually stunning movie.  The DVD image is unbelievably clear,  crisp, and super sharp.  With a large screen TV, you will swear you're  there with the ants sharing in their adventure.  The audio is excellent,  with neither the dialog nor the music being too soft nor too loud (DVD  producers, take note: there's nothing more irritating than having to crank  up the volume because the dialog's barely audible, only to have the house  rattle when the music or sound effects kick in!).  I have the standard  edition of the DVD, so there aren't many extras.  There is an alternate  French audio track.  AND there are the much-loved outtakes during the end  credits, both sets in fact!  These are hilarious and, in my opinion, are  actually funnier than the movie.  I'd pay to watch a whole DVD of such  outtakes.  If there's ever the possibility of a DVD wearing out, mine will  be at the outtakes, for I often pop the DVD in the player just to watch  those.  They are truly funny.So, despite my beef about the plagiarism, I  must give Disney kudos for cranking out a top-quality product.  But you  still owe it to yourself to check out the original film from which this was  taken, the Japanese classic &quot;Seven Samurai&quot;.  It's a wonderful  movie that's suitable for the whole family.",N/A

I'm maybe two years younger than the freshmen depicted in the movie, and the first time I saw the movie, was struck by what a time capsule it was. Granted,  the hazing was pure invention (who knows, maybe it did occur in Linklater's  town), but the demeanor, the pent-up energy, the fashions (using that term  very loosely as it applies to Seventies clothing), the sense of longing,  and the polysubstance abuse are all very accurate to the period. I watch it  sometimes to remember that period of time, which, compared to the  ultra-post-modern times we live in (including the very means by which we  are communicating right now) seems so innocent and full of hope.

He can't escape and the film's denoument doesn't definitively resolve the mystery.  No one other than David Lynch could have made this film.  The viewer's only escape from the tension is appalling, graphic violence.  Robert Blake's character will positively give you the 'willies'.

Nick Park (also known for Chicken Run and Creature Comforts) uses the Claymation technique (simmilar to The Nightmare Before Christmas) and I was reading 1 review which said his 1st movie, A Grand Day Out took 6 years to perfect.  That explains why he has only made 3 films at this writing.The 1st movie, A Grand Day Out, introduces Wallace, clever crackpot inventor in England who loves cheese, and his dog Gromit, the brains behind the two.  Wallace invents a rocketship to take himself and Gromit to the moon (after all, the moon IS made out of cheese, isn't it?).  They find out quickly that the &quot;oven&quot; they've been using to heat Wallace's moon-cheese is really a crater-skiing robot who doesn't take too kindly to their visit!In the 1993 Academy Award winning The Wrong Trousers, Wallace gives Gromit a pair of walking trousers (designed to walk Gromit when Wallace has better inventions to think up!).  Gromit feels ignored, especially after Wallace takes in a boarder, a mysterious penguin.  Later, Gromit discovers the penguin is a notorious thief and makes plans to save himself and Wallace!In the 1995 Academy Award winning A Close Shave, Wallace and Gromit go into the window washing business.  When Wallace meets the sweet Wendoline (who owns a knitting business) and her evil dog Preston, Wallace invents the Knit-O-Matic, a yarn making machine which strips the wool of a whole flock of sheep as fast as you can say &quot;Confound it, Gromit!&quot;.

I absolutely love this bombastic and funny movie, and I've been looking forward to getting it on DVD for quite a while so I could give it the 5 stars it deserves. So, was all the waiting worth it ?. Yes and no. -Mostly no, if I have to be completely honest. I disagree with some of the other reviewers when they claim it's &quot;a brilliant transfer&quot;, and that it's &quot;never looked better&quot;. Yes, it has more picture information on the sides than the old letterboxed MGM Laserdisc had, but that old disc was much brighter and therefore more pleasing to look at. The DVD is darker and the colors are a little faded, but generally the picture is ok. Actually, what irritates me the most about it is its aspect ratio. Like I said, it's wider than the Laserdisc, but not as wide as the version shown on TCM (once TNT). -That version was the one I was hoping Warner would've used; it's brighter, the colors are more satisfying, it adds more picture to both sides and it's just as sharp. I hope Warner will fix it and be more considerate next time they release it, but I somehow doubt it. (-I'd hate to prefer a tape over a DVD.)

Like the old Warner Brothers cartoons, it works at different levels for adults and children and can be enjoyed through multiple  viewings.  Children will appreciate Pee Wee Herman's manic style of comedy.  Adults, while enjoying this as well, are also likely to notice that the  movie swirls with images from the filmgoer's collective unconscious, all  delightfully twisted for comic effect.  Pee-Wee's Big Adventure is a giddy  kaleidescope of parodies on '70s road pictures, Hitchcock films, James  Bond, the Bicycle Thief, the Petrified Forest, and about a dozen other  films or genres.  Danny Elfman's score is perfect for the movie, full of  ironic references to classical film composers like Bernard Herrmann  (&quot;Psycho&quot;, &quot;Vertigo&quot;) and Ennio Morricone (&quot;The  Good, the Bad and the Ugly&quot;).Pee Wee's adventures out on the road  seem larger than life, drawn from deeply ingrained archetypes of the  American film.  At the end, the movie's focus contracts and we see that  Hollywood is actually smaller than life, full of banal falsehood.  The  irony is almost unbearable: it is this same Hollywood that brings us the  bigger-than-life images on which Pee Wee's adventures are based!  In the  final irony, James Brolin and Morgan Fairchild provide a patently phony  &quot;Hollywood version&quot; of Pee Wee's story.  Tim Burton seems to be  telling us &quot;don't look for your dream in Hollywood; it isn't  there--the beauty lies within, in the world of your own imagination.&quot;  It is a world in which something of the child lives on in the mind of every  adult.",N/A

Many people have criticized the cinematography and pace of this film, but I  found these to be all the m ore intriguing. Many times, the lack of light  adds suspense and in my opinion, added much to this movie. While I don't  think this movie was the best picture of 1999 (American Beauty clearly  deserved this honor), it was the 2nd best. This is the kind of film that,  with most, is either loved or hated. I hadn't been a particular fan of  Michael Mann before, but this totally changed that. Mann's incredible  interest to detail almost makes the film, and Pacino's performance, that  some even consider lackluster, in my opinion nearly outshines others.  Russell Crowe as Jeffrey Wigand probably deserved best actor, but Spacey in  Beauty showed those same qualities as Pacino in this film; Pacino should  have been up for, if not won, bestsupporting actor. Another  award-caliber performance was Diane Venora's role as Crowe's wife, Liane  Wigand-it was like she was real. This might be the feeling of the entire  film-like it's real. Panoramic views and intense close ups make you feel  like you're in there with Wigand and Bergman. With two of my top 5 choices  in the Academy's as well, I feel this may have been one of those years  where you can actually relate with the Academy's selections; the Insider  totally supports this. Some may find it overly long, some may find it slow,  but those with the intellectual capacity to sit still for twenty minutes  will be pleasantly rewarded with a splendid movie.

After this 1973 movie, Polanski will shoot good if not excellent movies that nevertheless won't match such references as REPULSION or CUL-DE-SAC directed in the sixties.CHINATOWN is the one-time gathering of a director, a producer and a screenwriter who joined for creating a common project. This situation would hardly happen nowadays ; cinema is becoming so dependent on economic issues that movies all look the same and hardly translate into images the genuine vision of a director. Just think that under the severe studio laws of the 30's, 40's and 50's, such talented directors as Alfred Hitchcock, Vincente Minnelli or Fritz Lang were able to create a personal cinematographic world notwithstanding the studio pressures. On the contrary, less than ten american directors in activity can be considered today as authors-directors.

213030,"Another Gene Hackman masterpiece....what if?........We sent a private military unit back into Laos or Vietnam to rescue our abandoned servicemen?The film concludes rightly that our own government would get in the way, and then there would be the Vietnamese or the Laotians...after a battle scene at a asian rice paddy with burning helicopters...the first few moments of the film shows the futility to getting accurate intelligence, but once he gets it, Hackman's character acts on it. He goes to his son's team mates who made it out of the LZ that they left him at years ago...don't get wrapped over the axle like some vets do that its unrealistic that we would leave someone in this way, we wouldn't. The beginning is a METAPHOR--a symbol of what America did in a larger sense when she refused to fight and lose more men to return the men we left behind. Real Soldiers wouldn't leave a buddy if it meant themselves getting killed, our government's leaders/bureaucrats-for-life don't feel this way. If you realize the Soldiers are running and they can't see who is shooting at them you'll realize its a metaphor.There is a Ross Perot type fellow who comes in and funds the rescue team's training and they go into action. In country they lose all their weapons/equipment and are forced to improvise with WWII/Korean-era arms bought on the black market. Fortunately Hackman's Colonel is an old Korean war vet and he mentors them and soon they are on approach march to the POW camp, they split up and Team A assaults the camp while team B steals helicopters to get away. The battle scenes are realistic in that the need to aim with marksmanship skills is portrayed in lieu of the normal Hollywood garden-hose depiction of weapons. However, as good as the vets are in their fieldcraft, the odds are stacked against them and not everyone returns from the mission, but one American POW is rescued and though its not his son, Hackman's wife reunite under a flood of media lights to confront the liars in our government who said there were no POWs left behind.Its been over 17 years now since this film came out and we are no longer talking about our POW/MIAs; perhaps we should re-watch this film? The point of this film is a reality check: IF we sent military force into Southeast Asia we would find our men being held captive. That's the message of this film, now what are we going to do about it now? If our country had honor we would have the valor to send the Vietnamese an ultimatum: send back our living POWs within x amount of time or we will declare war on you, not &quot;normalizing&quot; relations because we are scared of having to fight the Red Chinese and want Vietnam to be our counter to their drive for control of the Pacific.",N/A

Some of us may be fortunate enough to  have TV programmers who understand our insatiable desire for Buffy and will  oblige us with repeats until that wonderful day when the new season starts.  However, others are forced into a Buffy Free Zone; months of TV  hibernation.  This is why the release of Buffy videos is so important to us  fans.  By purchasing all the Buffy videos, we are able to cope with that  Hibernation period a little better.  Every week at the alloted 'Buffy' time  (Tuesday 10.30pm in Perth, Western Australia) we fans can now sit down and  get our (necessary, essential, medically-prescribed) Buffy fix.  I don't  need to tell anyone how brilliant these episodes are, because most of you  already know.  If you are one of the deprived and ignorant, &quot;These  episodes are brilliant!!!  Buy them!&quot;  I am now going to go and veg  out on the pink couch in my TV room and watch all my Buffy episodes.  I  have no self control.  Once I start watching one I have to watch them all.

36644,"I read the serial novel before I saw this movie, and I have to say that they did an excellent job converting the book into a movie.  Not everything  follows the book exactly, but it was near enough that I had nothing to  complain about.  In fact, the movie slightly changed some things about the  novel that I didn't really care about that much.  The fact that the novel  was published in serial form had King going back to Paul as an old man  between each part to continue the flow of the book, and to keep the reader  aware of what was going on.  Since the movie had a continual flow of its  own, it didn't require this device so they left it out, which I deeply  enjoyed.  The novel had another Percy like character working at the old age  home Paul resided at, and I didn't really feel he was necessary for the  story I was being told, so I'm glad the movie kept that part out.The  actors all did a magnificent job also.  After seeing Tom Hanks in the role  of Paul Edgecomb, I couldn't imagine anyone else playing the part to such  perfection.  Duncan did an excellent job as Coffey, infusing the character  with the proper touch of wonder, sadness, and his sense of isolation from  the world.  Everyone did a good job, right down to the dozen or so mice  they had that portrayed Mr. Jingle, an excellent job there.The effects  were outstanding too, from the executions, including the one that one so  horrifyingly wrong, the various miracles performed by Coffey, to the effect  of him coughing out the clouds of disease that he had taken back(as he puts  it) from each person he heals.  An outstanding job there, I just wish they  had had more on the DVD about how the effects were done, or maybe a  commentary by the director.Finally, I really enjoyed the wrap up at the  end of the movie, the punishment Paul feels he's serving for having killed  one of God's true miracles.  And it's true, we all are walking our own  green mile, and we never know when it's going to end.",N/A

151345,"Malice has a lot of twists and turns that will keep you wondering where the story is leading, and it is interesting enough to hold you to the end.  Unfortunately, the ending is more contrived than clever.  There are some  good perfomances in this film that make it work.  Nicole Kidman really  knows how to play a heartless woman.  Alec Baldwin's Jed is an egotistical  and corrupt doctor who has not completely lost his humanity.  One gets the  feeling that deep down he feels a little sorry that Andy (played by Bill  Pullman)had to get hurt in order to carry out his plan.  In the end, he  makes it clear that there is a line that he is not willing to cross.  Anne  Bancroft turns in a great cameo as the scotch drinking mother of Nicole  Kidman.  The only real weak link in the cast is Bebe Nuewirth as the  detective, I found her unconvincing.  Overall, if you like mysteries, this  is worth seeing.",N/A

119003,"First and foremost, I don't really care what I have been hearing from the  tabloids about Matthew Perry and Neve Campbell.  And when I heard this  movie is out, I was intrigued.  And when I've seen it, they were  sensational as they were paired up for the first time in this savvy  romantic comedy masterpiece. I picked this movie from Amazon the moment  Perry and Campbell were featured with Dylan McDermott (The Practice) in the  title cover of the DVD. The story is very original of its kind since  &quot;The Object of my Affection&quot; with Paul Rudd &amp; Jennifer  Aniston.  In &quot;Object of my Affection&quot;, a straight female falls in  love with an openly gay guy and were not meant for each other romantically.  While in Three to Tango, we see quite the opposite -- a straight guy, who  is accused and misunderstood of being gay, falls in love with a straight  gal, who thought that he is gay and at the end, were meant for each other.  As intrigue comes to embrace the viewers, the movie is beautifully directed  and well portrayed.  The movie kicks off with two architectural partners,  Oscar Novak and Peter Steinberg played by Perry and co-star Oliver Platt  respectively, together pursuing a job opportunity with a Forbes' tycoon,  Charles Newman played by McDermott.  With  Newman's acknowledgment of their  gay status, Steinberg &amp; Novak was awarded its big break except for  Oscar Novak, who is being misunderstood of being gay, was given additional  duties to spy on the tycoon's mistress, Amy played by Campbell for a  suspected romantic relationship between her and  a hunk football player,  Kevin Cartwright played by Clyk Cozart.  Wait what you are about to hear  later when Kevin confesses his attraction to Oscar.  And wait to see when  Oscar was selected and honored as &quot;Gay Professional of the Year&quot;.  It's chaotic fun just like the good old days.  Towards the end, Oscar  confesses his true identity during his honorary speech and his love for  Amy.  The final act is a kissing scene between Oscar and Amy, which put the  viewers to draw their conclusions.  For the movie theme, it's love conquers  all.  But for desperate fans searching about the truth, I hope that Three  to Tango is not some desperate attempt into reversing what's been said on  the tabloids.  Actually, the movie is a hit when these two were paired up  for the first time. Adding to the praise is the superb musical score.  The  swing era of the 50s and 60s is well adapted to the atmosphere of humor  around this modern story.  So if you're expanding your gay library, or if  you're just starting to build one, or if you like Friends and Beverly Hills  90210, then you'll like this one.  After all, Perry &amp; Campbell are just  among the youngest &amp; cutest stars around.",N/A

I'm getting a  bit tired of Hugh Grant's fumbling, ain't-I-a-kinda-cute airs. But  apparently his affected charm is working.

513372,"Many people have referred to 'Lola's' d&eacute;j&agrave; vu narrative structure, and compared it with such films as Sliding Doors and Groundhog Day.  I give it  more credit than that (don't get me wrong - I love Groundhog Day!).  In  those cases the character was caught in the film's mystery, unable to break  the time-warp spell and get on with their lives.  Here, time breaks,  shifts, bends, and cracks for one simple reason: because Lola wills it so.  She wills herself a second chance to get Manni the money.  She wills the  spectacular (photo-captured) futures of the people she runs into on the  street.  She wills the money from her father.  And in the final sequence at  the casino, her will is put on it's most bare, full-throated display.  Rarely have I been more satisfied with a cliched ending; it had to be that  way, because that's what Lola wanted (and whatever Lola wants, Lola gets!  Omigod!  Is it all just a thinly veiled 'Damn Yankees' reference?)It  borrows its schizophrenic style from 'Natural Born Killers', utilizing  video, film, and cartoon, quick editing, disturbed camera angles, and even  an oppressive musical soundtrack.  I'm still trying to decide if the style  added or subtracted from the narrative.  I enjoyed the cartoon; thought it  was perfectly edited; and never felt like I was watching the same scene  over again because the style was unique for each pass.  But there were  times when the style got in the way, when it didn't add a thing to the  narrative, and proved distracting.  But those times were few enough for me  to say that overall the style worked.  And it was so fun, and kinetic, and  riveting.  Like an 85-minute music video, with a cohesive (albeit  existential plot).  You can't not pay attention to Lola.",N/A

56257,"I bought this movie the other day at Suncoast because I am a big fan of  Robert De Niro and I had never seen it. I watched it later that night, and  I found it to be very good, but also very, very disturbing. It is about  this convict that has just been released from prison after 15 years, and he  decides to take revenge on his lawyer that put him there. He starts  stalking the lawyer (played by Nick Nolte) and his teenage daugter and  wife. This version of the movie is quite different from the original in  many ways. In the original, the family were so happy together. They were  like the friggin' Brady Bunch. In Martin Scorsese's new version, they are  very close to being torn apart. Sam (the lawyer) is fooling around with  another woman, and his wife suspects something is going on. Dannielle  (their daughter) is well aware that her parents are having problems and  often locks herself in her room, cuts up the television and calls a friend  to get away from her parents constant fighting. The family is in trouble  throughout the whole movie. Also, in the original, Max Cady's attacks are  not shown, just implied. In this version, however, we witness each one of  them in graphic, horrifying detail. There are alot of changes, but I guess  the director felt that it made the story more realistic. THIS IS NOT A  MOVIE FOR CHILDREN OR PRE-TEENS AT ALL! Overall, it was a good movie, but  it is definitly not for everyone, especially the squemish.",N/A

186435,"The way to enjoy Suspiria as a horror film is to put aside all consideration of logic and drama.  For above all else, Dario Argento is a weaver of visual palettes married to blatant scores, and in that area he  has no peer in the horror-film genre. Even if George A. Romero is an  infinitely better director of actors, editor and writer; even if John  Carpenter is subtler -- Argento surpasses them all in imagery, composition  and lighting, and Suspiria is his masterpiece in that regard.Much has  been made of the film's use of outdated stock and wild colour schemes and  that still stands.  Suspiria is one of the few films willing to abandon  reality almost entirely.  There's no physical reason why this room is blue  and one spot by the bed is red...but why not?  Suspiria is a horror show,  and its merits lie not in the construct as a whole (the writing is very  shaky and the narrative even worse), but in key sequences of almost  delirious power.It helps that Jessica Harper gives what may be the best  performance in an Argento film to date (Daria Nicolodi in Tenebrae and Asia  Argento in Trauma come close), saying little but expressing much with her  face and mannerisms.  The Goblin score proves the power of rhythms and  motifs within a film score (instead of the boring classical film scores  coupled with Carpenterian &quot;stingers&quot; in most '90s horror films)  and is entirely horrifying.  And the set pieces -- a room filled with  barbed wire; the famous maggot storm; the seeing-eye dog plaza sequence;  the incredibly vicious stabbing on the ceiling; the final destruction --  are breathtaking.Get past the bad performances (Harper excluded) and  terrible writing (dialogue *and* plotting), and just absorb this film with  your senses.

69274,"Another masterpiece from James Whale, the director of Frankenstein, Bride of Frankenstein and The Old Dark House.  Where the later Invisible Man sequels from Universal got campier, sillier and less scary with each film,  this first film adaptation of H.G. Wells classic sci-fi story exploits all  the fright value possible out of the character and the setting;  the story  is set in an English village during a blustery, snowy winter spell, and  Whale gets surprisingly good atmosphere out of the surroundings.  The  characters, even the minor supporting cast, are colorful and delightfully  'off-center';  this was another of Whale's trademarks.  Although the  special effects are dated by today's standards, the sight of the Invisible  Man (?  I can't think of how else to put it...) as executed by Whale is  still spooky enough to pack a punch, as helped by a masterful performance  by Claude Rains, whose wacky insane laugh and gravelly intimidating voice  are the only tools needed to pull of the characterization of the  transparent, doomed Dr. Griffin.  The rest of the cast is adequate, but for  the most part does not have a lot of familiar faces for the casual fan;  probably the most recognizable name aside from Rains is Gloria Stuart, who  60-some years later won a Supporting Actress Nomination for  &quot;Titanic&quot;.

So what does this movie have then?  The  answer to that is simply &quot;everything!&quot;It is best not to look  at it in terms of it being an animated picture because this instantly  clouds the judgment on what it is capable of.  This film really is  different to your normal animated movies. The story is far more intelligent  and involving than most others; yet it still retains  a sense of fun and  innocence, qualities which have helped to make the genre so charming. The  films characters are also great and the interaction between them provides  many great moments.  It is somehow always easier to attatch yourself to an  animated character than a human acting the part, this is definately the  case with this movie.  This story, about a boy who discovers a huge robot  and befriends it, had more of an emotional effect on me than any other  film. Films rarely make me cry but this one definately brought a tear or  two to my eyes.The dvd itself doesn't let the side down either.  It  offers amazing 5.1 digital sound which picks up the tiniest of detail in  the movies stunning soundtrack, giving an enjoyable assault on your ears.  The picture quality is equally adept, dealing admirably with the films  gorgeous colours. This is an all round great film, perfect for those  &quot;family evenings&quot;.  So well done Warner Bros; I wonder how long  it will be until the following pack are unleashing their own offerings onto  the market?  Goodluck to them.",The Iron Giant

Forest Whitaker, perfectly cast for  this role, also keeps the viewer guessing; a masterful performance.  Jarmusch sometimes appears to let his affection for hip-hop culture  overwhelm his sensibilities as a director, but Whitaker and the rest of the  excellent cast keep the film grounded in (semi-)reality.

It's the first movie I have seen in a few years that  had me smiling from ear to ear as it ended, not because it was a feel-good  movie but because it was so exhilarating to see a work so flawlessly  assembled, so marvellously written and acted, and finally one so  overflowing with the collective creative energy of the cast and crew. There  are more memorable characters and vignettes in this one two hour and 40  minute movie than in all the movies from the movies I have seen from the  year 2000. M*A*S*H and The Player are the only other two Altman films I  have ever seen, and I hesitate to see anymore as how can any of them be as  good as NASHVILLE?

427945,"This wonderful film is one of a handful that has the power to call me back to my childhood days and wrap me in warm memories of my Mom, Dad and little brother sitting around the television on Saturday night, watching the late  show.From the opening scenes of this beautifully photographed movie I  found myself caught-up in the intriguing post Civil War story of a boy and  his pet faun and their fantastic adventures on a scruffy Florida Everglades  farm. The film stars Gregory Peck, Jane Wyman and Claude Jarman in the lead  roles, with some of Hollywood's best character actors in the colorful  supporting roles.Peck gives an Oscar caliber performance as the  warmhearted father who tries his best to make a better life for his family,  with absolutely no help from the elements, which surround them. Jane Wyman  plays his wife Orry, the hardened mother and wife who is so embittered by  past tragedies in her life that she refuses to show any love for her one  remaining child for fear of losing him too. And Claude Jarman plays Jodie  the wistful young son who is just one summer away from adolescence and all  the hardships that come with growing up.This story is chock-full of  excitement and adventure sure to please the kids, and each of those  adventures is also a great lesson on life that will stay with them for  years to come. Just watching Jodie romp with his pet faun for that one  fleeting summer is a joyous site to behold and the touching scenes where  Orry finally begins letting herself love her son will bring tears to your  eyes. And of course the heart-rending scenes of Jodie trying his best to  get the yearling to run away so he won't have destroy it, all come together  to make  this movie one of the most emotional experiences of my childhood  and I must say I believe I'm a better person for the values I learned from  this timeless story.Experience this film with your children, you won't  be sorry you did.",N/A

But Tinseltown has  always cared more about what glitters and sparkles, and you can hardly say  that about ghosts, I guess. (-Unless you think &quot;The Frighteners&quot;  is a movie about ghosts and not a CGI show-off !.) Kerr is perfect as the  woman who sees the apparitions, Jenkins is wonderful as the housekeeper who  knows a thing or two, and the children are just magnificent. As a lover of  this particular genre I've always seen the spectres in this film as real,  and not just something in Kerr's head. -It's more scary that way, in my  opinion.

126754,"It's not an easy task to make a successful follow up to an already growing cult classic.  I guess being one of those few people that saw this film in  the movie theaters, it's hard to say why it was not better received.  The  remade Main Title sequence was very nice, giving us a feel for the older  film, yet making the beat faster and adding more bite to the piece with  drums and electric guitars ect.  The special effects of the original,  though commendable at the time they were made, cannot hold a candle to the  eye-popping visuals you get here, such as the holographic sequences as well  as Snakes underwater trip to L.A.  I also keep asking myself which  challenge I enjoy Snake in more?  Fighting the wrestler with bats and  trashcan lids in New York or making enough basketball shots before the time  clock expires with death following in L.A.  Personally I can't decide.  I  enjoyed them both.  But the one thing that L.A. lacks is depth, there just  isn't enough.  I can't help but think of the wonderful scene in 'New York  where Maggie (Adrienne Barbeau)  looks to the ground to see that her lover,  Brain(Harry Dean Stanton), has been killed with Snake looking at her,  saying &quot;Come on.....he's dead.&quot;, with a touch of compassion and  understanding as she looks to him with this look on her face and puts her  hand out, silently asking for a gun, to which he gives her one.  To me that  is a very powerful scene and unfortunately there really isn't anything in  the new film that comes close to this, even the scene involving actress  Valeria Golino seems forced.  People's deaths in this film seem like no big  deal whereas in 'New York it went much deeper than that with Snake asking  the President how he felt about the fact that many people died to save him  only to get a rather obtuse reply in return. Escape From L.A. is not a bad  movie.  Steve Buscemi steals many scenes as the wise cracking tour guide  and Pam Grier and Stacy Keach also add nice touches.  Plus the surfing  sequence with Peter Fonda is a lot of fun too.  But if you're expecting  another Escape From New York, you will be disappointed.  This DVD should  also include more extras than just the theatrical trailer, which is nice  though. An audio commentary with John Carpenter and Kurt Russel would go  perfect with the one they did for the original and The Thing.  And what  about the HBO First Look at Escape From L.A. featurette?  Paramount needs  to start giving us more than just trailers, especially at these prices.",N/A
73133,"I was expecting to see three versions of the film as it was advertised  earlier on when they were feeding the market frenzy to the buying public.  Don't get me wrong, this is an outstanding DVD package, it has all kinds of  extras, literally everything you would want to know about the whole  Terminator 2 film.  All the stuff that was released on the VHS edition back  in 1995 is all here!  Plus a whole lot more!  It gets kind of ridiculous  actually since there is just so much of it.  One thing I do have a  complaint about is the navigational control of the supplemental disc, when  you press a button for a certain area it either takes you to the main menu  or you have to keep pressing the desired button to get you where you want  to go.  That's kind of frustrating and those clever people at Artisan have  put a notice in the DVD package making people aware there may be  difficulties in navigating those controls.  If they knew there were  glitches, than why did they even release all of this in the first place?  Hmmmmm.  I was impressed with the Terminator 2 3D documentary, I have never  seen that attraction at Universal Studios and now I am totally stoked to go  there the next time I go to California.  Another problem with all of this  is the keep case they give you, there is too much stuff for the small  packaging they provide you.  I can't close the keep case and the cheap  aluminum cover is kinda lame.  If you put both discs and booklet in there,  it just doesn't fit.  Why didn't they do the same thing as Independence Day  with a keep case that holds everything? (By the way, Independence Day is  the greatest DVD package made yet next to Fight Club).  I am really glad I  didn't pay the full price that everyone else is having to pay.  Word of  advice, buy these DVD's before they are release, always pre-order since you  save between 10 and 15 percent everytime and you don't feel as bad in  buying your selection if isn't everything that you wanted.  If you're a  huge T2 fan, this DVD is a must have.  If you found the movie  &quot;amusing&quot; you'll probably like ID4 or Fight Club a lot better if  you don't own them already.

Three featurettes are included; one for the original version, one for the special edition and one for the Universal Studios 3D show. It would have been nice to see the whole 3D show, but I guess you have to go to Universal Studios to see it. A 50-chapter supplement composed of text notes inter-cut with interviews and special features. Design, pre-production, locations, training, weapons, sound, editing, publicity only touches the information given. You name it they covered it. I especially liked the sound chapter where they broke down the various sound elements so you can hear them isolated from each other. The audio commentary is very good coming from just about every cast and crew member involved. Subtitles are given so you know who is talking. Some of the material is reused though. For example, some of the audio commentary is from interviews used in the featurettes. Sixteen deleted scenes are added in the special version, 18 for the extended special version. To get the extended version enter the roman numbers seen to the right of the main menu; they look odd, but trust me they are roman numerals. I already had T2 on DVD, but the special edition, just for the delete scenes alone, makes it more than worth replacing it if you already have it. The extra scenes give extra depth to the story and the characters. Most bonus features become boring an initial viewing, but I think the ones on this DVD can easily be seen again and again.

One is orphaned and living with his grandfather, another is the  child of a life-long alcoholic, another the son of a rich oil man and  finally one that is the son of a rancher who intends to pass the business  off to his son.Different boys who become men, all with different  families, commitments and hopes that they must deal with. Going from a town  of 81 people to a town of 13 million seems exciting and overwhelming at the  same time and the four must face the fact that some may stay behind because  they want to and some might leave because they have to. It's nothing what  any of them had foreseen and it puts their friendship to the test.The  characters are real and if you've ever had friends that came from a small  town, these guys will remind you of their most endearing qualities. The  film doesn't put a stereotypical slant on these guys... they are educated  and plan on going to college. They've heard of the Internet and actually  know how to use a computer... they're not just riding broncos all day,  chewin' tobacco and leaning on fence posts... but they do have a different  perspective on life. They're less obsessed with &quot;things&quot; and more  interested in getting out of the small town to meet other people and see  how other folks live... and their friendship is the most important thing  they have, in or out of Dancer, TX.For those from big cities who might  read this review, I lived in Dallas for 30 years before moving to Denton, a  town of 80,000... don't be misled that only folks from tiny little towns  will be able to appreciate this film.My only negative comment would be  that the DVD is without any extras. No interviews, cast bios or behind the  scenes footage. How about interviews of some of the folks that actually  live in the town this was filmed in?  Word of mouth will continue to make  this film popular in the video market and not having extras on the DVD  makes it almost silly to have it on DVD to begin with.No nudity or foul  language, car explosions or light-sabre duels... this is a realistic  portrayal of real guys in a small town facing their families, their  friendships and their future. If you're into action-only films, this will  not satisfy, but rest assured this is not a coma-inducing film. It is  cerebral and touching and I highly recommend it.",N/A

The Nairobi Trio is, perhaps  Ernies' most famous contribution to comic lore with three band members in  long coats, hairy ape masks and derbys playing in a band to the music of  the Ray Charles Singers (why they made this recording will never be known)  but it is perfect for Ernie's motives.

One can write about this film a lot, but I will concentrate on what makes you watch it for the second, third, fourth time. It is a movie about Passion, about the time in a relationship when there is no point of return, about when love and hate are one deep feeling, which is called Passion. The story is not what is the most interesting here, the characters are. All four are brilliantly casted by Roman Polanski. Two girls show two totally different sexualities: one open, aggressive (Emmanuelle Seigner) and the other (Kristine Scott Thomas)- hidden, but it's like a volcano inside a sleeping mountain. When Seigner pours milk over herself during usual breakfast it's one of the most exciting moments in cinema, forget ""9  weeks"". Two male characters also oppose one another: Peter Coyote, a-never-will-be-Scott-Fitzgerald, who wants to reach an end in everything, whatever it will bring to him; and Hugh Grant, an emotional coward afraid of anything connected to deep feelings.

468553,"10 Things I Hate About You is a fairly basic teen love story, but with the added twist of Shakespeare and some good comedic acting.The story is based on Shakespeare's Taming of the Shrew. It is about two sisters, one very popular, Bianca Stratford (played by Larisa Oleynik) and the other, Katrina, or ""Kat"" (played by Julia Stiles) hated because of her gruff character. Their overbearing father (played by the hilarious Larry Miller), devises a scheme whereby Bianca cannot date until rebellious Katrina does, which seems an impossibility. Thereby is set up a scheme to pair Katrina off with the roguish Patrick Verona. One of the masterminds of this plot is Cameron James (played by Joseph Gordon-Levitt), a newcomer to Padua high, where the movie takes place. The other is his assistant of sorts, Michael Eckman (played by David Khumoltz).Though somewhat predictable, especially if you have read Taming of the Shrew, it is an interesting light diversion. The dialogue is quite well done, intertwining a word or phrase from Shakespeare with modern teen slang. Other odes to Shakespeare are seen in Kat's friend who idolizes him as if he is a teen heartthrob, plus reading of his works in one Kat's classes. The timing in the dialogue is also very Shakespearean (for a comedy). It's Very rapid fire. I think both David Khumoltz and Larry Miller are amazingly funny!Overall, this is not your typical shallow teen romance movie, but can appeal to anyone who enjoys witty dialogue, and many literary references.The DVD is unremarkable. It has a good DD 5.1 soundtrack driven by a nice selection of alternative rock - Letters from Clio had several cameos, but I believe they mainly played cover tunes, not their own stuff.

562228,"I was hoping for FOUNDING FATHERS to be so much more than it is.  Though touted as an examination of the personal lives of America's early leaders, and how those personal lives impacted on the formation of the country, in truth it's a very thin history of the revolution and constitutional convention.Try as it might with great voice acting and interesting featured historians, FOUNDING FATHERS can't make up its mind on how it wants to tell its story.  It follows neither individuals nor the narrative of the revolution in a coherently chronological way.  Yes, it's generally timely--each episode delves into the people and events of a particular set of years--but often the need to spin a biography of a founding father gets in the way of documenting the events themselves.  Just when it starts to make progress on explaining, say, the course of the war itself, it has to stop and give a biography of an individual.  Similarly, just when you're being made curious about Alexander Hamilton's Caribbean youth, you're thrown back into a discussion of the war's progress.With more episodes, it might have been possible to have made this schizophrenic storytelling style work.  But the problem is that there are too many founding fathers to examine, too many events to chronicle--and only four hours to do it in.  By trying to do too much, FOUNDING FATHERS can't help but do too little.  It took Ken Burns, after all, 11 hours to tell his story of the Civil War--and that covered fewer years than this series attempts.This series is thus best left in the high school classroom, or with others who haven't got a basic understanding of revolutionary America.  It works well enough as an introduction to the period.  But ultimately the series will bring up more questions than answers for most viewers.  And if you already know a bit about the formation of the country, you'd do better to turn elsewhere to further your education.",N/A

289765,"This movie received very little attention, perhaps because of the slow pacing.  It is exactly that slow pacing that allows the stories of the family, coming to America one by one, to unfold. A way of life that some of us are old enough to barely remember--gathering at Grandma's every Sunday for dinner, playing with cousins to spy on the adults--is lovingly portrayed.The pace of life and the times change, particularly for those family members who come of age and marry in the 1950s.  The families have other distractions, and the big family dinners become less and less frequent, replaced by new entertainments.We watch as the amazing new invention, television, becomes so much a part of life in this extended family, and the changes it brings to the family dynamics.  There are funny, tender and moving moments in this finely crafted and acted film.  The story of this family and the transformation it undergoes is a fascinating metaphor for the social changes we have seen in the last 50 years, shown within the history of this immigrant family.",N/A

I watched all 24 episodes before writing this review, and highly recommed this set if you like X-Files.Some reviewers have commented on poor  video quality, but mine was excellent. The picture and sound quality were  perfect--a little dark on the picture sometimes, but that's just the way  the original show and commerical videos are.  It's not anything faulty in  the DVD's.One of the benefits of having the entire first season on DVD  (in addition to the quality) is that it takes up so much less room than  videotape, you get it all at once, and it's all there in order. Plus, the  cost comes out better than buying tapes with 2 episodes each (not to  mention they didn't put them all on tape).  The case is nice and compact,  and you don't need an entire shelf to keep it on.

552215,"This bittersweet story focuses on the day-to-day lives of common folks in 1960's Ireland.  At the center of the story is its namesake, Agnes Browne (Anjelica Houston), who has just lost her husband and is struggling to support her seven children.  The film presents a slice-of-life of families struggling to stay afloat, but trivializes their plight by making its heroine's greatest ambition a trip to a Tom Jones concert.While the story has some charming and poignant moments, it is mostly mundane and lacks the ability to keep all but the most sentimental viewer engaged.  It skims the surface of the lower middle class struggle to stay above the poverty line, but lacks the depth to draw us in.  Unlike ""Angela's Ashes"" which gives a gripping account of poverty and its human cost, this film just tries to bounce merrily along and make the best of things.  The humor was low brow and the Tom Jones ending was hokey in the extreme.Two actors stand out, namely Anjelica Houston and Marion O'Dywer.  Houston carries the entire cast with a standout performance that is spontaneous and heartwarming.  O'Dwyer has a radiant smile and affability that makes her seem like she could be anyone's best bud.  The chemistry between the two was excellent.Overall, this was a human-interest story that was very human, but not very interesting.  I rated it a 6/10.",N/A

This movie is really for those of us who just need to sit and watch a cute, campy movie that's fun and entertaining.  (But, that's just my opinion.)  This movie has parts that draw you in because they're so silly.  (Jason isn't normally one of my favorite actors, but he plays his part to a &quot;t&quot; in this movie.) He has trouble communicating with his dad, they do work it out before Jason has to go off to Viet Nam. My favorite part is Jason and his father in the boxing ring &quot;working it out&quot; as a matter of fact, but only because they knew of no other way ..it was so sad, that's a plus.  The guys get a chance to go to Hollywood and stay with the rich, Hollywood type uncle of Jason's character, so they take it.

119013,"This is a forgettable film that masquerades as a romantic comedy when it is really a satire on homophobia.  Actually, the storyline is quite clever and there are a number of good sight gags, but the dialogue is uniformly  dreadful and lowbrow.  The writing is hack and sitcomesque which might  explain why they loaded this cast with TV actors.We are presented with  two architects who are vying for a contract that can revitalize their  ailing business with a roguish developer named Charles Newman (Dylan  McDermot).  Charles is married and having an affair with Amy (Neve  Campbell), but he is jealous and wants to keep tabs on her.  Thinking Oscar  (Matthew Perry) is gay and no threat, he asks him to spy on her, implying  that it might help him to get the contract.  The rest is pretty  predictable.  They fall in love, but she thinks he's gay so there is no  hope.  Eventually love prevails (no spoiler here, no-one on the planet  could watch this movie and think they wouldn't get together), but not  before numerous mistaken gender orientation gags run their course.This  film was obviously presented from a gay perspective as a satire on  homophobia.  All the gay characters are portrayed as respectable, admirable  and wise, while all the straight men are portrayed as rogues, misfits and  buffoons.  You see skit after skit where homophobia is lampooned.  Women  can't confide in a man unless they think he's gay, because straight men are  just too insensitive to understand.  Gays in the closet are bashed repeated  with snide remarks.  This probably explains why this film was more well  received by women than men, since much the comedy really mocked straight  men and their fear of homosexuality.Matthew Perry has made a career out  of playing hapless losers with the appeal being that it's funny to see  someone who is even more woefully inept than the average viewer.  While I  don't find this particularly funny, I will give him his due and say that he  is a master of the art.  He gets high marks for being able to  simultaneously evoke laughter and sympathy over his plight.  Also, I found  his chemistry good with Campbell, and his longing for her was played with a  good deal of sincerity and sensitivity.Neve Campbell is really just  window dressing here.  Her role is to smile, look cute and sexy and play  the love interest.  This is not a real stretch for her since she can  essentially do all those things by just standing there.Dylan McDermot  was pretty dreadful as the scoundrel.  In his defense, he didn't have much  to work with since the way his part was written he was portraying more of a  caricature than a character.  It is difficult for an actor to slip into the  skin of an absurdity and know exactly how to play it.The best acting in  the film came from Oliver Platt, who played Oscar Novak's business partner.  He was funny and played an excellent straight man to Perry's clown.  Platt  is a veteran and a professional and always brings substance to his  supporting roles.This film has its moments but not enough of them.  It  is effective social satire and it is mildly successful as a romantic  comedy, but it bogs down frequently with too many variations on the same  gay theme.  Though funny in parts, it is generally just silliness.  I rated  it a 5/10.",N/A

558626,"Well it seems that some people are disappointed with Disney's three disc box set, but to be honest I really can't see why.  Quite simply, this is as in-depth and as stunning as DVD can get really.Apart from the fact that both Fantasia and Fantasia 2000 are two of the best animated films ever made, the sheer quality of the discs had my jaw dropping to the floor on numerous occassions.  Not only are we presented with THX sound, Dolby Digital and DTS which will give anybody's sound system a good working out, but the clarity of the picture is in all honesty the best I've ever seen on DVD so far.For a film that's 60 years old, the quality of the print for Fantasia is especially impressive, with nearly every sequence full of lavish, deep colours that never fail to impress.  It proves that with enough work, a film even this old can still look stunning today.  Even the soundtrack comes across as powerful, although naturally the digitally recorded sound of it's successor simply blows the original out of the water.Indeed, Fantasia 2000 is just as impressive as the original, even if it's far shorter in running time.  As for the DVD, well I am being totally honest here when I say that it reduced me to tears on several occassions, particulary in the power of the quite superb classical music used.  I may only have a Dolby Pro Logic sound system, but never, and I mean never has it produced quite as startling power before.  The climax of Respighi's wonderful Pines Of Rome had my front room full of sweeping, majestic emotions, matched only by Stravinsky's awesome The Firebird, where my subwoofer exploded into the kind of life I thought it didn't possess.  Amazing.So, THE FANTASIA ANTHOLOGY is quirte possibly the finest DVD project ever produced.  Crammed full of extras which will take an age to get through, it's quite simply unmissable for any movie fan.Finally, a note to people thinking of buying the Region 2 version of this set - don't!  If you're player can play Region 1 discs, this version has extra features not on the Region 2 version.  None of the commentaries are on Region 2, and it also lacks THX or DTS!",The Fantasia Anthology

189819,"I chanced upon this movie by accident.  I rented it at Blockbuster because it starred Kevin Spacey and I think there was some comparison to Robert Altman's The Player, which I loved.  I was unprepared for what I got.  First, you have Spacey, my favorite actor currently working today in one  of his most brilliant performances ever.  I think his turn as Mel Proffit  on Wiseguy is the only job he has done that I like better.  Next,  you have Frank Whaley, a talented young actor who slips between extremes of  timid uncertainty at the beginning of his job with Buddy, to icy cool  professionalism toward the end.  He also shows a warm caring side with his  girlfriend (played very smartly by the sexy Michelle Forbes) as well as a  psychotic off the deep end side when he takes Spacey's character hostage.  I loved it on first viewing.  I found a used copy of it about a month  later and purchased it immediately.  I have watched this film about 25  times in the last 5 years, and it never gets old.  It is fresh and blackly  funny every time I watch it.  One thing that I have noticed on many  repeat viewings is that Spacey's Buddy Ackerman character is really a much  nicer guy than he appears.  It is my belief after viewing this film so many  times that Buddy actually does care for Guy.  You can see it in the little  grins that he gives after he has reamed Guy out for something, and in the  way that all of his advice is based on his own personal experience.  I  don't think that Buddy is lying when he tells Guy that after a year with  him, Guy will be ready for anything.  He is deliberately cruel in a very  educational way.  I believe that he is trying to get Guy to accept the  realism of the terrible, unfair Hollywood system, and that he really does  mean for Guy to follow in his footsteps, but is being intentionally brutal  in an attempt to quickly teach Guy the lessons that it took Buddy himself  10 years to learn.  I also think the ending is one of the most effective  twists I have ever seen on film, and proves my point that Buddy actually  does care about Guy and wants him to succeed.This movie is a must  see for anyone who is interested in the Hollywood studio system and wants  to see a viciously funny black comedy.  It is also highly recommended if  you are a Kevin Spacey fan.I'm really waiting to see a complete  review of the quality on the DVD for this film before I go out and purchase  it.  This is definitely one of my top 10 favorite films of the last 5 or 6  years.Buy it now and laugh yourself silly.",N/A
149260,"Every critic thinks terrible thoughts... many were thinking, &quot;SHAM!&quot; upon viewing the movie &quot;The Rage: Carrie 2.&quot; An utterly resistable piece of filmmaking, the movie, directed by Katt Shea and starring a semi-lucid cast of teenage actors, tries to add to the plot of the original movie with little success and much blasphemy.It's present-day, and Bates High School is bustling with the usual teenage activity: people going to class, hanging out with friends, jocks sleeping with girls as a game of who gets the most points... like I said, the usual teenage activity. Among one of these girls is Lisa, who happens to be friends with Rachel, the resident campus &quot;freak.&quot; Lisa, who has lost her virginity to one of the football jocks, jumps from the top of the building and kills herself, which brings to the attention of Rachel the knowledge of the facts surrounding Lisa's death. While the jocks are doing everything they can to keep Rachel's mouth shut about certain events, one softy jock, Jesse, becomes enticed by Rachel, befriending her and soon becoming her boyfriend. All of this storyline is accompanied by the sidestory of Rachel's telekinesis and the origins of her power: she is Carrie White's half sister.The plotline of the film does make a small amount of sense, but not by a long shot. While trying to come off as an intelligent thriller that will continue the original story, it comes off as sounding juvenile and ineffective through the execution of the story as well as most of the acting on the actors' parts. Emily Bergl gives a slightly credible performance as Rachel, and in some instances, she has her moments of sentiment and feeling. This is the extent of the acting as a whole, and the rest is left to dwell on cliche teenage one-liners and conversations that are as brainless as the filmmakers. Under the direction of Katt Shea, who came onto the project in mid-filming, the film suffers from a lack of feeling or emotion, far below the level contained in Brian de Palma's shocking and highly emotional original film. To sum it all up, this is one movie that the world could live without; a blatant waste of money and so-called talent.The DVD edition of this film is average in its design; the film is beautifully presented, but the overall lack of special features ruin the experience. Image quality is sharp with highly saturated colors and crisp edges, yet in some scenes the picture is wanting in clarity. Sound design is somewhat effective, really only able to engage in all channels during the flashback scenes and the gruesome party scene. The only special features on this disc are deleted scenes, director's commentary, and and alternate ending sequence. Where's the theatrical trailer? Where's the making-of featurette? What is happening to DVD?",N/A

Homer's fling with Candy proves that, when it's the movies, the guy gets the girl regardless of how much disbelief the audience must suspend. What did he have to offer her that she couldn't get from a guy who didn't look like her little brother?3. Until I found out Homer and Candy get together in the book version of CIDER HOUSE RULES, I thought their affair was just an excuse to exploit the attractive actress Charlize Theron.4. CIDER HOUSE RULES was the first film with Michael Caine that I was able to catch at the movies in more than ten years. Great talent always finds its way back on top. As I write this, Michael Caine has appeared in about 90 films.5. After leaving the orphanage, Homer is the only white person rooming with several black men, but no one so much as blinks?

419251,"The 1950's were a movie theater-goers dream come true, particularly if you were a kid and loved sci-fi.

But as kids, we didn't know and couldn't have  cared less. All we knew was &quot;Invaders from Mars&quot; was scary and  memorable, particularly the last sequence with the flash-backs and the  Martians' bizarre surgical procedures which turned lovable citizens into  obedient, nefarious saboteurs (anyone for a commie takeover)?

There are plenty of  celluloid carry-over scratches here and there and some segments,  particularly during the last third of the film where they're in the dark a  lot, seem a little washed-out. What's most irritating to me, however, is  that the section in the observatory where Arthur Franz and Jimmy Hunt are  reviewing models of various types of space craft which could be visiting  Earth, has been omitted. Most people probably won't miss it  though.Nevertheless, &quot;Invaders from Mars&quot; is still  quintessential sci-fi of a bygone era.

71016,"Though not a comic jewel on a par with his 1991 &quot;LA Story,&quot; Steve Martin's latest comedy, &quot;Bowfinger,&quot; stands as an inventive, high-spirited, occasionally silly, but often hilarious take on  the trials and tribulations encountered in the over-saturated world of low  budget filmmaking.Martin stars as Bowfinger, a down-on-his-luck wannabe  head of a movie production company that brings new meaning to the term  &quot;shoestring.&quot; With an equally ragtag band of idealists as his  crew, this quixotic visionary hits upon an absurd scheme to bring his  godawful action film script to fruition; after it is handily rejected by  Kit Ramsey, one of the hottest action stars in the business, Bowfinger  concocts a scheme to film his screenplay AROUND the actor, plotting the  man's every move, following him around town, and instructing his own  amateur actors (who are oblivious to Ramsey's obliviousness) to jump out  and act out their parts for the hidden cameras before an increasingly  startled and distraught Ramsey. This clever setup generates a considerable  wave of comic energy that propels the story forward even though, like most  films that rely heavily on a one-joke premise, the film does suffer a bit  from the diminishing returns of repetition. However, Martin's creative  skills as a writer keep the idea fresh for most of the film's running  time.The film is blessed with an absolutely smashing comic performance  by Eddie Murphy, who brings just the right note of both arrogance and  anxiety to his portrait of a superstar whose internal insecurities and  paranoia are hidden beneath a veneer of arrant egotism and aggressive  despotism. Murphy is less successful with his other role, that of a shy  nerdish Ramsey look alike (he actually turns out to be Ramsey's brother)  whom the crew is compelled to use as a stand in for the real star when the  latter is driven to seek a rest cure to soothe his frazzled nerves, caused,  ironically, by Bowfinger's own antics. In all fairness to Murphy, however,  in the character of Jiff, the actor has been given no solid center from  which to build an effective comic performance. As a writer,Martin has  failed to really develop Jiff's purpose in the proceedings and the  character seems tacked on mostly to give Murphy a chance to indulge in some  weak displays of slack jawed buffoonery.Where the film does triumph is  in the constant inventivenss of the situations, particularly the clever way  in which Ramsey's paranoia dovetails so nicely with the absurdity swirling  around him. Martin has also cast a company of first-rate performers as the  sharply delineated secondary characters who make up Bowfinger's  never-say-die team. Particularly wonderful are Heather Graham, whose  character stumbles off a bus a naive young kid from Ohio, idealistically in  search of quick stardom, who quickly learns to use her feminine wiles to  enhance her starmaking opportunities, and Christine Baranski, whose  over-the-hill and over-the-top method actress, determined come hell or high  water to make an impression on the blithely unaware Ramsey, provides many  of the genuine belly laughs in the film.&quot;Bowfinger&quot; lacks the  keen societal and psychological insights of Martin's greatest film,  &quot;LA Story,&quot; since it does tend to flail satirically at more  obvious and less universal targets. Nevertheless, Martin creates a tone of  utter devil-may-care silliness that sparkles throughout the often  quasi-slapstick proceedings. Like any fine comedy, it envelops the audience  in a world where just about anything can happen. And Martin is filmmaker  enough to make us want to come inside and be a part of it.",N/A
27435,"This film is is simply excellent, far superior to My Fair Lady which to be honest I have never been a huge fan of: I regard it overlong and Audrey Hepburn was a little unconvincing.  This film concentrates on the play rather than songs and visual eye candy, though the latter it still succeeds in, with the ball-room scenes and some beautiful shots near the opening of the streets of London capturing the period perfectly.  But it's the performances that carry the film mainly; Hiller is brilliant but Howard is truly fantastic, the role fitting him like a glove as he takes full advantage of the hilarious script.  But special mention must go to the DVD - the print is absoloutly GORGEOUS, the film looks as if it was made yesterday and the dialogue is as clear as a bell without a hint of noise.  Occasionaly the print slips slightly in the latter half but these tiny interludes of what seems like an unmastered print only make you see how superb the rest of it is.  And the packaging is also worth mentioning - the insert has some great photos and a replica of the original poster.  At this price especially no collector should be without this disc.",N/A
219367,"Take John Wayne off his horse and put him on the front of a pickup truck, and it's off to the races in this classic film about a group of professional big game hunters in Africa. Wonderful combination of action, comedy and the cast of characters reacting to each other as the storyline develops. The Duke is the undisputed leader of this group of international stars, who are plainly shown to be doing the capture scenes themselves. That adds so much to the film by not using stunt doubles. This is evident in the last capture scene of the rhino as Wayne is plainly shown trying to untangle ropes and move the trapped beast. He stands just mere inches from the horn of the rhino when the beast begins bucking and snorting!  Think about this also. Wayne was on the front of the truck doing the capture scenes. That truck could have easily turned over, and the Duke would have been dead 17 years before his time. Raw courage and devotion to his trade! A must see movie for the entire family!",Hatari VHS

309614,"From Russia With Love is certainly an excellent  OO7 film to date and is Connery's third best in my  opinion, I like Thunderball and Goldfinger slightly better. The plot is that SPECTRE is bent on getting the LEKTOR, a  top-secret decoding device. They plan to offer it to Bond from a young  girl. SPECTRE plans then to kill OO7 and take the LEKTOR for themselves.  The acting is excellent. sean Connery is in top form as the dashing British  agent OO7, and few Bond girls are better than Daniela Binachi's Tatiana  Romanavo. Robert Shaw and Lotte Lenya are superb villains, especially Shaw  as Rosa Klebb and Donald &quot;Red&quot; Grant. Kerim Bey is wonderful as  Pedro Armendariz. The action includes OO7 being chased by a helicopter, the  famed &quot;gypsy camp&quot; scene, an incredible and long hand-to-hand  fight aboard the Orient Express between Connery and Shaw, and a good boat  chase near the end. The gadgets include Bond's attache case, Grant's  garoutte wire watch, and Rosa Klebb's switchblade shoes. The script is very  good, the cinematography is dark and brooding, and the settings are nice.  The only problem is I didn't like the song that much but I loved the score.  Overall, everything from the acting to the dark atmosphere, to the good DVD  quality make this film a terrific OO7 film and a welcome edition to your  DVD library.",N/A

283153,"Near the end of the First World War, Charles Plumpick is dispatched to a French town that has been wired to explode by midnight.  His mission is to defuse the explosives.  Never mind that he is an expert at raising and training carrier pigeons.  He dutifully sets out on his mission, and avoids capture by the Germans by escaping into an insane asylum.By now, we're all familiar with the idea that war is itself insane.  We've all been exposed to the idea that insanity may be a higher form of sanity.  What's magical about this film is that it communicates these ideas with such charm and such finesse.  I can't imagine that anybody could avoid falling in love with the inmates as they take over the town once it's abandoned.Alan Bates is superb as the gentle yet dutiful Plumpick.  A very young Genevieve Bujold is absolutely wonderful as the innocent Coquelicot.  I rarely notice the music in a film, but in The King of Hearts it plays a pivotal role in establishing the mood, and accompanying the action.  It is also fine music in its own right.This could have been an earnest anti-war film heavy-handedly stating its moral (remember the movie made of Catch-22?).  The direction, the music, and the performances of all the actors (Alan Bates and Genevieve Bujold are the only names that I recognize, but there isn't a weak performance here), though, lift this far above that level and make it a masterpiece that has stood the test of time well.",N/A

486746,"Director and co-writer Bonnie Hunt delivers the goods in ""Return To Me,"" a touching story of two deserving people who are afforded a second chance at  love and happiness.  When we meet Grace (Minnie Driver), she is suffering  with heart disease and awaiting a donor for a transplant.  Architect-builder Bob Rueland (David Duchovny) is happily married to  Elizabeth (Joely Richardson), they are deeply in love, and Hunt quickly  establishes just how perfect their lives are together; so perfect, in fact,  it becomes somewhat unsettling because you know that tragedy of some kind  or other is imminent.  When it comes, the transition is handled succinctly  and with the skill of a seasoned professional.  When Elizabeth dies, Grace  receives her heart.  A year later, Bob, still mourning the loss of his  wife, meets Grace at the Irish-Italian restaurant owned by her grandfather  (Carroll O'Connor), where she works as a waitress.  Neither are aware of  the intimate link they share to the heart that has given Grace her life.  In the hands of a less savvy director, the story at this point could easily  go astray and become mired in coincidence and cliche.  Hunt never comes  close to allowing this to happen, however, and instead hits every note  squarely on the head so that the plot fairly resonates with precision and  timing.  A veteran character actress herself (she plays Grace's closest  friend, Meg, here), she seems to know instinctively just when to add the  right light touch to offset the drama, then fleshes it all out with an  array of great characters,especially Robert Loggia, as Angelo, the  ""Greatest Italian chef in Chicago,"" and James Belushi as Meg's husband,  Joe.  There are no wasted moments in this film; the story moves right along  and takes you with it.  The dialogue is often witty and always real; in a  scene between Grace and Meg that takes place in the hospital (prior to  their notification that a donor has been located), in which Grace can  barely draw a breath, she looks up at Meg and says one word, ""Rosebud.""  After Elizabeth dies, when Bob finds himself alone at home and finally  breaks down, Hunt gives the scene time to build and play out, so that it  rings true instead of being glossed over and simply used as a tool to move  the story along.  When it happens we, as an audience, are also afforded  that time to realize the suffering he's experiencing, and it allows us to  feel it as well.  The scene in which Grace, Meg and Joe are at home  awaiting a dinner guest (a former priest), is beyond hilarious.  Highlighting an exceptional cast, David Duchovny and Minnie Driver are  unforgettable as Bob and Grace; and the multi-talented Bonnie Hunt rises to  a whole new level of artistic merit for giving us a truly memorable and  heart-warming movie that is a joy to experience.  Written by Hunt and Don  Lake, ""Return To Me"" is a delight from beginning to end, the kind of film  one waits for to come along.  Hopefully, in the future Hunt will treat us  to even more movies of this caliber.",N/A

13715,"Howards End is a quiet yet powerful drama that tackles so many issues at so many levels. Every person that I have ever discussed the novel with has had a different interpretation of it; oddly enough, it has always seemed to  me that we were all right. There is so much going on in the fully  dimensional lives of these wonderful (and sometimes not-so wonderful)  characters. I was beyond happy to find that the film managed to capture  much of what was so important to us in the novel.I first saw the film  in 1993 and have seen it many times since. It is one of those dramas that  can leave you speechless at its end, despite a wonderful absence of  anything sensational. It manages to capture so much of what happens in the  novel.The piece is stunning to the eye from beginning to end. The  soundtrack is equally wonderful and photography, music and art all fit,  thanks to what I imagine must have been first-rate direction. Emma Thompson  brings Margaret Schlegel to life so perfectly for me, right down to the  body language and tone of voice. One has the impression that here is true  concern for other people. There is something so subtle about the character  as portrayed, especially the way in which she carries herself, often  lulling her head to one side when seemingly deep in thought, mulling over  possibilities. Helena Bonham Carter is equally perfect in the role of  Helen...brave, tempestuous, kind, impulsive...these are to amazing women,  especially considering their period in time. Anthony Hopkins is so easy to  mistake for the character he plays that at times you may despise Henry  Wilcox far more than you could ever hate Hannibal the Cannibal.This film  has left me quite happy in its adaption from one medium to the other; It  communicated what the book does and even what is most subtle for me in the  novel....that Howards End is in many ways about a mystical little genus of  justice, of people getting what is rightfully theirs and what has been  promised to them. The fact that Howards End is the hub around which these  characters dance and spin their respective lives, and is ultimately the  prize to the most noble of character, seems only just enough. This adaption  would have made Forster proud, of this I am sure.",N/A
566267,"When it first appeared on television back in 1993, I wasn't much of a fan of this popular NBC series. Maybe it was that it was because it didn't have the wise-cracking, satirical humor that I have become accustomed to after watching shows like ""The Simpsons"" and ""Married With Children"" for years. However, as the years went through, ""Friends"" became a favorite of mine via the many late-night reruns on syndication.In what has become a very popular trend in recent months, the producers of ""Friends"" have decided to release a box set of the series 10 best episodes on DVD and VHS. Much in the same manner as many series that have been released on both video formats in the past few months (e.g. ""Sex &amp; the City""; ""The Sopranos""; etc.) this box set captures the best of the show and its' great cast. Jennifer Aniston (""The Object of Affection""), Matthew Perry (""Fools Rush In""), Courtney Cox -Arquette (""Scream"" trilogy), Matt LeBlanc (""Lost in Space"" 1998 film version), Lisa Kudrow (""Hanging Up""), and David Schwimmer (""The Pallbearer) all were relatively small-role actors before being casted on this series, and now they are superstars in their own right.Among the best ten episodes, I rank ""The One With Ross's Wedding"", ""The One With All the Thanksgiving"", ""The One Where Everybody Finds Out"", ""The One With the Prom Video"" and ""The One With All The Poker"" as the top five episodes in this box set. All were great and the cast, especially Lisa Kudrow's funny antics, make this a must have for television-philes of 1990's comedy series.The ""Best of Friends"" box set will make a great gift or addition to your video library. Besides the episodes, the DVD version contains the music video by the ""Rembrandts"" playing the series title song, subtitles, and Cast biographies.

In the case of this little movie, the  subjective complaint is PLOT, PLOT, PLOT. A couple of things. First, when a  latter-day movie has the name of Twister, what do you expect? A Long Day's  Journey Into Night? Schindler's List? I think not. This movie is for  escapism and it should be judged in that context.Secondly, the movie  does have a plot. Hell, there's even sub-plot.Bill Paxton is Bill  Harding, a TV weatherman chasing his soon-to-be ex-wife Jo (Helen Hunt).  You see, Bill wants to get married to psychiatrist Melissa (Jami Gertz) but  he can't until he get Jo to sign the divorce papers. Jo, however, is  occupied. See, she is chasing something herself. Tornadoes. She hates them.  She's obsessed by them. So, she hunts them down so she can place small  sensors into them. The sensors will give her and other scientists better  information about them. While she's chasing the tornadoes, she's running  away from Bill. She's playing hard to get, or rather, hard to get rid of.  Jo is ambivalent about divorcing Bill. She's so ambivalent that she's built  his invention, named Dorothy, to launch the sensors into a funnel, if she  catches one. Maybe, in the meantime, she'll catch her man. Again.So, off  they go. Jo's chasing tornadoes with her rag-tag bunch of storm chasers.  Bill is chasing her trying to get her to sign the divorce papers, while  trying to convince the aforementioned rag-tag bunch that he's not back in  the storm-chasing game. All the while, Melissa is trying to figure out all  the things swirling all about her.Meanwhile, while Jo's group is  rag-tag, the group headed up by Dr. Jonas Miller (Cary Elwes) is not. It's  slick and para-military. Dr. Miller seems to have ripped off Bill's designs  and constructed a sensor launcher of his own to rival Dorothy. So, it's a  race to see which storm-chasing team gets their device launched first.I  went into the movie house wanting a thrill ride and I got exactly what I  wanted. It was an enjoyable experience. I can actually see Twister: The  Ride on the Universal Studios tour in the forseeable future.

You really lose track of reality, because the screenplay keeps  turning the old &quot;The character wakes up and it's all a dream&quot;  cliche on itself.

It does  necessary means it's his most IMPORTANT in term of film history, (HIS GIRL  FRIDAY and RED RIVER should be considered his highest achievement, in that  sense); many would just say it's a remake of RIO BRAVO, one of his most  popular film.But I actually enjoy EL DORADO more than RIO BRAVO because  of its playfulness. It is perhaps not the story itself is interesting, but  the way Hawks tells it and Wayne and Mitchum (two of my favorite  super-heroes, I must say) acting it. They fill the movie with a lot of  humor; not only the comic relief James Caan and Arthur Hunnicut who are  funny, but Wayne and Mitchum may get even more laugh than these  two.There's nothing fancy about Hawks's direction in this film, but  everything is done so natural, casual and indeed perfect, which is, I  think, only a great master of this trade can achieve.EL DORADO has  actually more dramatic element than RIO BRAVO, and these dramas are  actually far more carefully constructed to make the story more interesting  than in RIO BRAVO. For instance, Wayne's and Mitchum's camaraderie is  colored with a tint of old age: not only that Mitchum is a drunk alcoholic  (as Dean Martin in RIO BRAVO) but Wayne also becomes crippled. The  motivation of revenge gives the strength to this basically entertaining  plot. And these dramatic darker themes do not interfere with the enjoyment  of the story, which is amazing with Hawks, but rather reinforce the  excitement of it.The new transfer is quite brilliant. It captures the  richness and depth of the original  IB-Technicolor print.  If you have  already seen the VHS edition, panned-and-scanned and with shallow colors,  you haven't really seen this film. With this DVD, you can enjoy the  masterful direction of Hawks, the beautiful score by Nelson Riddle (I think  the song is very good), and the harmony of performances of those incredible  actors who can become those characters just by being in front of camera  repeatedly. It's really one of the most enjoyable, entertaining movie ever  coming out from Hollywood.",El Dorado VHS

132188,"I first saw the preview for this movie on the internet.  It looked great!  It never made it to a theatre near me so I've been waiting for the video.  I finally saw it last night.Deterrence is about an unelected President  (ala Gerald Ford) who must deal with another invasion of Kuwait by Iraq in  2007, by Saddam Hussein's son.  The President is stuck in a diner in  Colorado during a blizzard, so must deal with the situation there with a  few telephones and local people around, and one news cameraman.  The  president decides that issuing a threat on global TV of using a 100 megaton  bomb on Bagdad would be effective to make the Iraqis turn back.  It doesn't  turn out to be quite that easy.I won't reveal any more, but it makes for  good cinema similar to such movies as Fail Safe.My one big gripe is  that &quot;the secret&quot; revealed at the end is only known to the  President.  His top advisers, including NSA and Joint Chiefs of Staff  apparently have no clue about it, which I find to be absolutely  unbelievable given what the secret is.",N/A

And...Well, it's good.  It's always hazardous to put voices to a comic strip but veterans Michael Bell, Tress MacNeille and perennial great Frank Welker come through.  Robin Williams and Dustin Hoffman (in an ironic role as a cross-dressing cockroach) add some fun to the proceedings, but...I dunno.  It seems, well, dated and somewhat adult.  My five-year-old didn't understand why the cockroach was dressed that way (&quot;Is that a boy or a girl cockroach?&quot;) and I'm sure the reference to &quot;The other white meat&quot; is the &quot;that's a spicy meatball!&quot;--or maybe the &quot;Where's The Beef?&quot;--of the '90s.  (If you don't get the references, you should get my point.)A long and nearly unmodified excerpt from &quot;Lost Horizon&quot; made me just about ready to fast forward.

Further I was somewhat disappointed by my first viewing and taken aback by the sound quality and the shortness of it.  I may in future revise this rating upward--and it still won't be any more helpful. This movie is what it is: An aesthetic and fairly amusing mixed bag of laughs aimed at various audiences.

Hugh Jackman is ready to explode as a MAJOR film star and he does a fantasic job playing Wolverine here.  The mutant battles are easily the best scenes, with some of the dialogue straining.  I wish they just could have battled each other all movie.  Still there was ample action and fantastic FX.  This is a great looking film on DVD and has some really cool extras like Hugh Jackman's screen test and some cool stills.  The best thing about this movie is that it lays the groundwork for many sequels to come.  The next proves to be even better with Wolverine seeking out vengence on the people who mutated him.

394823,"This is my favorite Olsen Twins movie, and I'm an adult who can honestly say she enjoys it.  I grew up on Full House and have always loved watching those two.  They've done a lot of movies, and this one is my favorite.  Supported by the charming Steve Guttenberg, the extremely funny Kirstie Alley, and a supporting cast that includes Philip Bosco as the sly and smart butler and Jane Sibbett as Clarice, the snooty, evil-plotting fiance of Guttenberg's character, this movie is sure to please any fan of Mary-Kate and Ashley.  So the story goes kind of like this: look-alikes Amanda and Alyssa (Mary-Kate and Ashley, respectively) literally bump into each other while at a summer camp (that Amanda's a camper at and that Alyssa's extremely rich father happens to own).  Once the two realize how closely they resemble each other, they hatch a plan to get Alyssa's single dad and Amanda's pretty caseworker romantically involved.  Will they succeed, amidst foodfights, canoes falling over, and the interference of the conniving Clarice?  This is a fun movie from beginning to end, with lots of visual treats (Andy Tennant Films--Fools Rush In, Ever After, etc.--always seem to have beautiful scenery), funny dialogue, and fantastic characters.  There's exactly one slightly objectionable word (spoken by one of the Olsens), but I think only very conservative parents will have a problem with it.  This movie is part Parent Trap, part Three Men And A Little Lady, and . . . basically just a really cute movie.",It Takes Two VHS
22050,"I can't say I liked _The Red Dwarf_. That's not to say I strongly disliked it, either. I simply can't go so far as to say I actually enjoyed the film. To me, there was no plot and no real storytelling. As such, the film is mostly just... well, benign.I can usually only engage with a film when it is telling me an interesting (usually complex) story. _The Red Dwarf_, a novelty concept piece at best, is really only a parable constructed from a single, rather obvious, theme repeated over and over again.Parables generally show less interest in the storytelling and more in the analogy they draw between a particular instance of human behavior and human behaviour at large. The simple narrative surface of this film gives it a mysterious film noir tone, but in the end it's all just mood and does very little to paint a clear picture of the main character, Lucien L'Hotte._The Red Dwarf_ seems much more intent on teaching spiritual values than telling a good story. By the end of the film I knew of only one aspect of Lucien's personality -- Monsieur L'Hotte was a big man trapped in a little man's body. I would have liked to have known more.In the case of _The Red Dwarf_, the analogy most obviously drawn upon for the progression of the screenplay is the notion explored in _I Know Why The Caged Bird Sings_. That &quot;caged bird&quot; theme resounds throughout _The Red Dwarf_.With L'Hotte, it seems obvious that he feels isolated from freely enjoying the world around him because at work and in love he is made to feel inferior to &quot;normal&quot; people who constantly foist their prejudices upon him.I first saw the &quot;caged bird&quot; motif being played out with L'Hotte at the home of a fat, aging countess (played by the fat, aging Anita Ekberg). L'Hotte meets the countess for the first time outside her home by the pool. The little &quot;bird,&quot; excuses himself to go to the bathroom. While inside the countess' home, he takes a frenzied &quot;bird bath&quot; in her huge tub, dries off while gazing at the &quot;prison&quot; of his own encroaching body in the mirror and then goes back out to stand naked before Ekberg. Lovemaking ensues between the two with the countess' cat watching the &quot;little bird&quot; flitting all over her massive petowner.Next, there is a scene where L'Hotte is in a cab and begins whistling a bird song to himself. The driver, a black man, looks into the rearview mirror and the two of them begin chuckling in a shared complicity or understanding of what it is to be &quot;caged&quot; -- L'Hotte in his body, the black man in his.L'Hotte befriends Isis, a young girl who travels with and performs in her &quot;father's&quot; circus. Her mother died years before in a trapeze accident, so her father forbids her to perform on the trapeze even though her dream, after meeting little Mr. L'Hotte, is to do a trapeze act that incorporates his clowning. Images of Isis on the trapeze -- her &quot;perch&quot; -- serve to depict her in her own &quot;cage,&quot; unable to fly through the air because of her father's strict edict.And, if you had any questions about that &quot;caged bird&quot; theme, there's another scene toward the end of the film when L'Hotte takes the matter of his little friend, Isis, and his own future into his own hands by laying down the law to Isis' &quot;father.&quot; As he finishes threatening the man, he proceeds to release a bunch of the circus' birds from their cages, symbolically freeing himself and the little girl who has shared his experience of being &quot;caged.&quot;And so on and so on.Sadly, _The Red Dwarf_ is one-trick pony. And that pony ride gets old fast.",N/A

305035,"Here is the deceptively simple, yet mind-blowingly warped story of what happens when the lives of an average European couple cross the path of a seemingly average family man -- a guy whose mind blew a fuse at the age of six and began to bleed the thoughts of a sociopath. This film's ending is so dour, depressing, and hopeless that it made me want to vomit.But &quot;The Vanishing&quot;'s *most* disturbing aspect is that it actually carries the audience into the sociopath's mind, and invites each viewer to share the mad logic behind the heinous acts he commits -- a logic based upon principles universal and fundamental.I've read many reviews which state, &quot;This is the scariest film I've ever seen.&quot; I think it's more accurately described as &quot;disturbing&quot; instead of &quot;scary&quot;.. a subtle, yet important distinction... Whereas a film like &quot;The Changeling&quot; (arguably one of the scariest movies ever made, about a haunted house) or &quot;The Exorcist&quot; has the ability to frighten for a couple of hours, here is a little wonder (MINUS any blood or gore) that could genuinely warp a viewer's mind if he or she took it too seriously.I rated this film 4 stars instead of 5... not because it's poorly made or acted (on the contrary, the production and the performances are wonderful), but simply because it is difficult to fully enjoy a film that is this upsetting... When all is said and done, the grimness makes the viewing experience undesirable. In sum, I'll echo another viewer's sentiment: I wish I'd never seen this.Watch at your own risk.",The Vanishing VHS

466313,"So said the tv spots for this Mel Gibson crime/caper flick.  And make no doubt about it; Mel's a thieving, conniving, murderous thug, but what makes you root for him is his dogged determination to get what is rightfully his.  This film is a throwback to the old gangster dramas, along the  lines of old Cagney films, but it's much more brutal and vicious.  It's  full of great moments, and Mel never once steps out of character making his  performance that much more believable.  Even Kris Kristofferson's good in  it, and that's sayin' somethin'!  Throw in the luscious Lucy Liu and you've  got a good flick.  Still don't think Mel can pull off playing a scumbag?  See this one and be proved wrong.  As James Coburn states in the film,  &quot;Man, you're just mean!&quot;  My favorite part of the movie is the  first ten minutes, as Mel goes from being bleeding and busted to having a  good suit, a pocket full of money and a credit card, and it's all 'cause  he's a slick S.O.B.

104609,"Frankenstein Must Be Destroyed is one of the finest in Hammer Horror. This  is the fifth of the series with the master horror thespian Peter Cushing as  Dr. Frankenstein. The film starts off with a quick little beheading with a  scythe, then it's off to the lab. A drunk intruder, looking to burglarize  the good doctor, foils Frankenstein's plan forcing him to find other  accomodations. He moves into a bed n breakfast and terrorizes a young  couple, and blackmails them into doing his bidding. Frankenstein gets the  young man to murder, rapes the girl, and steals a colleagues brain, all in  the name of science. This is by far the darkest of the Hammer Frankenstein  series, and the best. We see that the doctor will stop at nothing to prove  a point . Lots of suspense, blood, and lots of the beautiful Veronica  Carlson. My only complaint is the reproduction is not the greatest.

92230,"The recent release of the director's cut of Lethal Weapon add depth to the film by the inclusion of approximately 7 minutes of new scenes.  The additions are in the beginning of the film when the characters are still  being developed.  In one scene, Gibson's character walks into the line of  fire of a sniper, and in another he has a rather violent reaction to a  commercial on TV.  In the context of this portion of the movie, it further  establishes the pain Gibson's character is going through and his mental  state...is he crazy or just not caring what happens to him?  Additional  scenes also establish Glover's character's concern at growing old...does he  still have it?The balance of the film is pretty much unchanged. Lethal  Weapon is a fun buddy action/comedy movie, but shines more than the  sequels, which emphasized comedy and cartoonish action.  Gibson and Glover  actually act here, Gibson in particular in the scenes where he is  struggling with his wife's death.  The interplay between the actors makes  this movie a cut above the standard action movie.",N/A

The story of the giant gorilla captured on an uncharted island and brought back to be displayed in New York, where  he escapes and creates havoc, has captivated generations of movie goers. No  doubt it will continue to do so for many years to come.The special  effects still look wonderful today, even in this era of computer generated  monsters. This is mainly due to Willis O'Brien, Kong's animator. O'Brien  was a master craftsman, and 'King Kong' is his finest hour. The photography  also adds much to the mood of the film. The scenes on Skull Island, in  particular, have a strange, almost dreamlike quality.'King Kong' has  variously been described as horror, science fiction, fantasy, and fairy  tale. It is all these things and more. The scenes of Kong cradling Fay Wray  (the great screamer) in his paw, fighting the Tyrannosaurus, and making his  final stand atop the Empire State Building have become part of movie  legend.

Seriously, though, I don't know why he  wasn't nominated for an Oscar. His performance as Shakespeare, the writer  who suffers in both love and writer's block, is one of the most romantic  and lovely performances I have seen in a while. His chemistry with co-star  Gwyneth Paltrow is red hot. You can just feel the way they yearn for each  other, but can never be truly together because she is promised to another.  Mix this situation in with Paltrow's desire to grace the stage (which was  illegal back then), and the hilarity that ensues as the company of men try  to rehearse for &quot;Romeo and Juliet,&quot; and you get one of the most  original films in years!  The only reason why I'm giving it four stars is  because it really wasn't completely about love.

This is an Aussie story of teen love set in 1965, heroic as only teens can play it.  It is fun to watch, authentic and original at the same time, a coming of  age flick in the English boarding school tradition of ""Dead Poet's Society""  (1989) and ""A Separate Peace"" (the novel, not the so-so movie).  Noah  Taylor stars as Danny Embling, an outsider who reads Sartre and Camus while  satirizing the school's empty traditions.  Across the lake is the girl's  school where Thandiwe Adjewa (Thandie Newton), daughter of the Ugandan  ambassador, is learning to meld with the Aussie pale faces, including a  gifted pre-Hollywood Nicole Kidman.Thandie Newton and Noah Taylor, as  beautifully directed by John Duigan, are the reasons this film is so good.  She has a fearless integrity about her that overcomes the prejudices of her  school mates.  He is wise and brave at a hundred and twenty pounds.  She  too is ultra sophisticated.  She even met Sartre.  This is a story about  the love between two outsiders who, with their strength of character win  over not only their classmates, but the audience as well.  Imagine  teenagers as witty and poised as say Eartha Kitt and Gore Vidal, and you  get a hint of how it's played.Nicole Kidman as the snobby Nicola  Radcliffe (the name says it all) manages a subtle supporting role with a  diamond-in-the-rough kind of charm and just the right touch of on-screen  growth.  The scene where she shares her stash of vodka (or perhaps a clear  fruit liquor) with Thandiwe Adjewa is beautifully turned by Director John  Duigan.  Also excellent is the hotel scene where the adults are revealed as  intrusive in the extreme.  I like Danny Embling's line as he deadpans to a  re-robing Thandiwe, ""They're all funny, aren't they?""  Yes, those adults  are a little peculiar.This is not unflawed, however.  The ending,  despite the rousing music, seemed a bland washout, leaving us with a sense  of disappointment.  And I thought the first love scene with the two  ""touching"" was a little unreal.  I mean he might have kissed her!  There's  a limit to how great a coming of age, boarding school movie can be,  especially when the adults have only scarecrow parts.

301141,"&quot;Robin Hood: Prince of Thieves&quot; is a rolicking adventure ride  that will please most people.  If ya can't get past the accents, then miss  out on a good movie.Let me clear a few things up:1.  &quot;Robin  Hood: Prince of Thieves&quot; was on a tight production schedule.  There  were three (count 'em, three) Robin Hood movies being produced at the same  time, and the one to come out finished first would be the one released in  theatres.  One production gave up and backed out.  That left two Robin Hood  movies - one with Kevin Costner, and one with Patrick Bergen.2.  Because  of the tight schedule, Kevin Costner's accent was dropped to be  &quot;dubbed over&quot; in post production.  They simply didn't have the  time to worry about accents if they wanted to get the movie finished.3.  Filming complete, the dubbing was dropped because of lack of time and the  movie was finished.  &quot;Robin Hood: Prince of Thieves&quot; was released  theatre-wide, whereas the Patrick Bergen version was slated for TV.Now  that I have the little niggling thing about accents straightened up, get  passed it and watch the movie for what it was intended:  pure  entertainment.There is plenty of humor - from Little John's river  fighting antics and his wife's bantering, to the Sheriff of Nottingham's  humorous frustrations (&quot;why a spoon, cousin, why not an ax&quot; -  &quot;Because it's dull, you twit, it will hurt more!&quot;), the viewer is  not disappointed.  The entire cast was enjoyable to watch, and the  costuming was superb.  The lush green of the forests (the movie was filmed  in the forests of Nottingham - which proved to be a problem - the airport  is nearby) is captured wonderfully on film, as well as the forest  &quot;homes&quot; Robin Hood and his Merry Men have taken refuge in.I  rather enjoyed this movie because Kevin Costner's Robin Hood was a Robin  Hood for the 90's.  He was intelligent, witty, and funny, the way we  picture him to be.  Go ahead: rent the movie and lose yourself in a great  adventure flick.",Robin Hood - Prince of Thieves VHS

118962,"What's a movie supposed to do besides entertain you? Could it be that they're supposed to make you question things about life, trust, love, sex, marriage, the American Dream? Despite the pacing, this will have you--if  you are in any sense thoughtful, or introspective--wondering a lot of  things, in the film and in life. Stunning from frame one, it never  relinquishes it's tight hold on the senses of the viewer.  But that's why  it's an misunderstood masterwork. It draws you in and teases like an  impressionist painting.  You get too close to it, you begin to see flaws.  Things never are totally what they appear to be, nothing's ever all good or  all bad, black or white, I mean, can you really trust what you think you  see? Is the image of the good life, the good life? We all do kinda take  things for face value, that's for sure.  And movies are reflective of some  of our overall views. But movies are colored light images projected on a  screen, right? Real or unreal?EWS messed with one's mind on several  levels--did you accept rich man's Sydney Pollack's explanation of the  mansion's going's on? Plenty of Freudian slips and verbal faux pas,  there--evil incarnate, there. Did Nicole have an affair with the naval  officer (even in thought) or not? Was Tom's (although we want to side with  the integrity of the main character) answer's to Nicole's questions--ie, he  never once felt enticed by a female patients body even in the clinical  setting--completely honest? Will men ever be as honest as women? Will women  ever be as dishonest as men? Or are they equally prone to being  corrupted/corruptible/incorrigible? Were you perplexed as to how  provocative those &quot;blue lust shots&quot; of Nicole with her naval  officer were--even if they were taken for the cinema, Tom &amp; Nicole are  married in real life and it must've been quite a surreal experience having  to go through it, for all parties involved. Notice how Kubrick's use of  color punctuated certain passions...particularly red. Almost like an Ingmar  Bergman film.There are little nuances in Kidman's acting (take a look at  &quot;To Die For&quot; and &quot;Malice&quot;, by the way) that makes one  believes that she &quot;knew&quot; of Tom's goings on at the mansion,  (hell, she may have even been one of the masked sex slaves), at the  hooker's apartment, even when he is confronted at Pollack's--she didn't  have to be told, but the fact that Tom DID tell, however, sets well with  the American filmgoer's desire for a linear, &quot;and they lived happily  ever after&quot; story... at last, we want to believe our certain accepted  notions will never be challenged. But they are, and they always are...and,  sadly, most of us would rather keep our eyes wide shut to these  challenges...For those of us who don't mind the challenge, the questions  and the debates, this provocative film is gonna be in our mental libraries  for years to come...",N/A
516836,"I will go see anything David Mamet does.  I love the halting, intentionally metric performances he requires of his actors.  I loved Glengarry Glen Ross and even Oleanna (despite its weak attempt to tackle  the subject of sexual harassment) due to the jazz-like dialogue.This  movie doesn't share that extremely stylistic component that says  &quot;Mamet&quot;.  It's a pretty simple story and truthfully there's not  all that much to it.  But what I liked was the sort of ambiguous posture of  the Winslow boy himself, along with an amazing, smoldering performance by  Jeremy Northam.  I don't know why this guy isn't more famous.  He was the  undisputed star of &quot;An Ideal Husband&quot; more recently and received  like fourth billing.  This is a lovely quiet movie and I recommend it both  on its own literary merits as well as because Northam is great.",The Winslow Boy VHS

The good thing about it is the fact that you can never see exactly what's scaring them (what exactly is in the package that Heather  finds outside the tent, is Josh alive or dead at the end, etc.?)  What I  don't understand is whether Heather Donahue, Josh Leonard and Mike Williams  actually know what's going on.  Are they acting, or are they really scared?  I know none of the scary parts are actually real, but do the gang think  they are?  Please E-mail me that answer on  horrorflicker@hotmail.comAnyway, the movie is something special.  The  directors have taken a risk at the film, which might not have worked, but  it did work, and they must have got loads of money from it's sucsess.

220731,"This has been a favourite of mine for many years.  I had to buy it.  It is about the imortality of youth, the mortality/morality of humanity, the frailty of relationships and life, the universe &amp; everything!!!  It is the only film I know of that I can watch in any occasion and feel something different towards every single time I view it.  Never sentimental, it treats its viewer intellegently.Ruth Gordon turns in one of the most moving performances I have ever witnessed in the cinema, but it is the young Bud Cort that steals this film as the morose, palid, mousey Harold.  He is an extremely gifted actor, even early in his career... it seems a shame that he is seemingly wasting himself on lesser films lately (Bud, if your reading this, the only good film I've seen you do recently was DOGMA... no offence...)Now that it is on DVD it can be introduced to a whole new generation; wether they cotton on to its &quot;cosmic dance&quot; is another question!!!  That said, I think it would be nice to do a special edition version with interviews with the surviving cast members, especially Bud Cort.",N/A

I just assumed it was another 90210 (this one with fangs) -- MY MISTAKE.  I  was in the UK in the Fall (where they were in the midst of airing Season  2), and after a nightly dose of Buffy, quickly became a believer.  The show  is hip, funny, witty, and very smart -- but more importantly it's also  moving, intelligent, and right up there with the best drama and writing in  TV history (yes you read that right).  The acting throughout is first-rate  -- not only do we get heroes to relate to, but villains who are sometimes  uncomfortably understandable as well (long live Spike &amp; Co).  This is a  show that deserves every accolade it gets -- and then some.  Can't  recommend it enough - and this video pack is a great way to get started.(Now I'm just counting the hours til the complete set comes out so I can  get caught up in more ways than simply reading those Season 1  synopses...!)For those of you new to the show -- you're in for a treat.

105290,"As a huge fan of David Brin, whose book &quot;The Postman&quot; served as the basis for this film, and the post-apocalyptic genre in general, I was looking forward to seeing this movie.  My friends tried to warn me away from it, and after all the negative press I read, it was hard to keep an open mind.The Postman isn't awful, but it is incredibly overlong.  It seems to crawl about as fast as a bulldozer out of gas.  Thankfully, the plot develops in that time, but The Postman lacks the sweeping, involving, intricate details that define an &quot;epic&quot; (and David Brin's books).The problem is that Costner and the editors wanted to include as much material from the novel as possible, but instead of folding plots into each other, it only half-develops different lines, or totally leaves them untouched.  The Holnists, for example, while only playing a major role in the last quarter of the book, become a variety of &quot;devolved&quot; enemies and serve as the &quot;main bad guys&quot; in the film.David Brin's works are extremely complex and intelligent, which Costner and company no doubt recognized, but The Postman was partially dumbed-down for audiences more interested in brainless action-schlock like Mission Impossible 2 or the watered-down &quot;epic&quot; Gladiator.  The dumbing-down occured in the wrong places; the editors no doubt assumed that audiences would have the attention span to sit through a three-hour movie but still wanted something substance-less - it just doesn't work.  By trying to satisfy the fans who wanted the complexity and sincerity of the book, and attempting to appeal to the wider popcorn-munching audience, Costner strove for a middle ground, the same route he found with dazzling success in Dances With Wolves, and ended up falling off the fence.The Postman is worth watching for the post-apocalyptic sets and ideas, especially if you are interested in the genre, but I can't imagine this film as much more than an artifact, appealing to the few of us who enjoy the post-nuclear, post-apocalyptic films like The Postman.DVD dirt -The transfer is OK - not great, but not terrible.  You can tell it was done in the early days of dual layer, because there is a slight hiccup at every chapter change.  Some sections of the film seem quite dirty, with obvious splotches and scratches.  The sound transfer isn't bad, but the voices and the effects aren't mixed properly; viewers with a center-channel system can simply turn that speaker up, but those without will experience very quiet dialogue with very loud music and ear-blistering explosions that seem almost out of place.The only extra worth talking about is the &quot;Postman's CGI Route&quot; featurette, which talks mostly about splicing green-screened actors onto computer-touched-up shots of landscapes, or replacing some background scenery with matte images or still frames.  Nothing terribly special, and the featurette only lasts for 15 minutes or so.",N/A

342736,"This video is great for the SNL fans and will remind you of all of Gilda's wonderful characters from the show, along with special appearances from Paul Shaeffer and Don Novello (Father Guido).  The other great thing about this taping is that it also captures all the excitement of the &quot;live&quot; show production itself. The cameras follow Gilda as she runs off for costume changes and often cuts to backstage during segway sketches. As for the material itself, Gilda is a pure student of &quot;Truth in Comedy&quot; (probably from her Second City roots). Much of the humor is in her portrayal of common characters and moments in ones' life.  This show brings fond memories and clever comedy writing. Her ending piece of &quot;touch me with our clothes on&quot; and her story of cuddling up to Carl Reiner records always brings a tear to my eye, even though the lyrics are also very funny in itself.  Although there is some &quot;dirty words&quot; to animals, the comedy is not really &quot;blue&quot;...the censored version often shown on TV is still just as funny.

Doom Generation includes songs by early-90's art-rock giants like Lush, Cocteau Twins and Jesus and Mary Chain, but the film has little else to recommend it.

124100,"What happened to our drive-in theaters? I first saw &quot;Gunfight at OK Corral&quot; at the drive-in and what an experience that was, this great western on a giant screen, the speakers blaring the rousing theme song sung  by Frankie Lane, and Burt Lancaster and Kirk Douglas, larger than  life,riding across the plains. I rank it high in the many Wyatt Earp sagas,  a little below &quot;Tombstone,&quot; but very high. Yes, on video, the  wide screen shrinks as in all epics, but the chemistry between Lancaster  and Douglas holds up amazingly well. Lancaster's laconic  but not wooden  performance as Wyatt Earp is perfectly complemented by Douglas's outgoing,  sardonic, consumtive coughing Doc Holliday. The villians are veteran  Hollywood old hands and if you look close you'll see a very very young  Dennis Hopper as Billy Clanton. The story is kind of confusing as to really  why things can't be settled more peaceably but the climactic fight at OK  Corral, much longer than depicted in other films treating the same  incident,  seems more exciting. The cinematography is wonderful, showcasing  wide vistas that even register on this video.Add to this a tremendous music  score by Dimitri Tiomkin and will have you wistling with Frankie Lane for  days. A great western, but I miss those wide screens, as we all long for  that mythical west created by Hollywood but in many parts actually existed.",N/A
59007,"Army of Darkness is an extremely rare movie in one regard: it's a silly movie that knows it's silly; it has all the gloriously pathetic one-liners that can be asked for, wonderful acting and physical comedy on Bruce Campbell's part, and battle scenes that are both fabulous and cheesy  looking at the same time.  I am, though, rather dismayed with the  &quot;R&quot; rating this movie received - it's just too silly to be seen  as offensive.  But, I'll leave my critique of the movie rating system for  another time (heh, heh)....  The Limited Edition is worth every penny.  The commentary by Campbell and the Raimi brothers is side-splittingly funny as well as informative.  The &quot;making of feature&quot; is also interesting, as are the story boards, trailer, deleted scenes and creature drawings (its obvious that everyone had a lot of fun making this DVD).  Its also interesting having the two versions of the film, but it left me wishing that there was a third cut.  The battle scenes in the Director's Cut were much better and - as pointed out in the commentary - make much more sense.  Overall, the directors cut should have been used as a base, with the theatrical version's vastly superior one-liners and ending and prudent lack of a sex scene (Raimi pointed out, and I agree, that the sex-scene was completely inappropriate - it just makes the movie WAY too serious.  Ash and Sheela's relationship really was much better left at &quot;Gimme some sugar, baby.&quot;) Overall, an extremely fun movie that stays funny with multiple viewings.",N/A
310005,"This movie does have a more realistic feel to it compared to other bond movies (count that for what it's worth). This makes for a more believable and suspenseful movie in my book.  The fight scenes are well shot and are  actually exciting!  Compare this to  dreadfullness to come in the roger  bore era.  I have a feeling Lazenby was willing to do more of his own  physical action in an attempt to establish himself.  His performance wasn't  the best, but it's better than any of Dalton's, Moore's, Brosnan's in  Tomorrow never dies, and Connery's in You only live twice, diamonds are  forever, and never say never again.  I'll take Lazenby's enthusiasm and  more realistic approach over Connery's obvious mugging and self-infatuation  in you only live twice any day of the week.  Ideally, Connery would never  have begun to wallow in lazy complacency after thunderball.  This movie is  really good, with the best chase scene (the one ski chase), the best music,  and the best bond girl.  And it's a story!  You might actually believe  this one happening!

Bill Hurt never really comes clear for me in anything, but like Brooks, he's perfectly cast here. (It's creepy that Hurt gets top billing on Amazon and the DVD box. Among the three main characters, his easily pulls the least weight. Holly Hunter's the emotional center of everything in this movie, she's making the choices and carrying every scene, and her name should go first.)After you watch this one, tell me if you think Cher, in Moonstruck, deserved the Best Actress Oscar over Holly Hunter in Broadcast News (and Meryl Streep in Out of Africa).

But after watching this abomination, it's highly unlikely that I'll be picking up one  of Lovecraft's books in the near future.  It's confusing almost from the  very beginning (stories within dreams within stories).  The gore is neither  frightening nor funny.  The framing story about Lovecraft makes no sense,  and the individual narratives aren't much better.  Worst of all is the  third tale, which follows a pregnant police officer as she becomes the  captive of a group of alien monsters that (I have to say this without  revealing too much, since I suppose there might be some people who actually  want to be surprised by this film) do some pretty terrible things to her.

Please  don't misunderstand and think I'm some sort of weak-stomached cinematic  chicken (I laughed all the way through Dead Alive); there's just something  about the third little story that really, really crosses the line.

60043,"&quot;In the Name of the Father&quot; is a brilliant and controversial movie which examines in some detail the case of the Guildford Four, and especially the case of Gerry and Giuseppe Conlon, who were wrongly convicted of bombing a pub in the town of Guildford, England, on October 5, 1974. This bombing, which took the lives of several innocent victims, was alleged to be part of an ongoing Irish Republican Army (IRA) campaign of terror that year. The convictions of the Guildford Four, it was later proved, were based on forced confessions, perjured testimony, and - at best - extremely scanty and questionable forensic evidence.&quot;In the Name of the Father&quot; is a brilliant film on all levels. Daniel Day-Lewis turns in a tough, gritty, and realistic performance as the irrepressible Gerry Conlon - perhaps one of Day-Lewis' least known, but best movie performances ever. Pete Postlethwaite is magnificent as the gentle Giuseppe Conlon, who is the film's ultimate victim. And Emma Thompson rises to her usual level of brilliant acting as the tough-minded but emotional lawyer, Gareth Peirce.This movie does not pretend at any point to be an objective examination of the Guildford Four case. It is a strong advocate for the innocence of the people involved, and an unsparing critic of the British legal and penal systems. Some of the points made in the film border on the hyperbolic - for example, the interjection of the fictional IRA terrorist &quot;Joe McAndrew,&quot; to press home the point that the British government knew of the Guildford Four's innocence, but, fearing a loss of confidence by the British public, chose to ignore evidence which exonerated them. Still, the film does not suffer any loss of credibility by so blatantly taking sides in such a politically and emotionally charged issue.This is one of those rare films which does three things very well. First: it entertains. This is a dramatic and exciting story, replete with wonderfully realistic characters that are easy to understand and relate to.  Second: &quot;In the Name of the Father&quot; educates. Very seldom have I learned more about a particular time or set of circumstances than I have from this film. (I must note at this point that I was living in England in 1989 when this case came to a head. I followed news accounts of it with great interest.)  Third: the movie persuades. It is both a scathing criticism of a legal and penal system gone awry, and an apt description of what can happen when a democratic system becomes afraid of its own people. At the same time, it's a wonderfully inspiring testimony to the ultimate strength of the human spirit in times when all seems nearly lost.",N/A

Harriet  is an optimistic character but being in strange places and unable to affect  the amicable but distanced relationship with her husband, makes life for  her far more difficult. Her attention is almost always upon her husband  while Guy's attention is focussed upon his world and everyone in it. The  Fascism that slowly creeps into their previously neutral corner of Europe  does not help the Pringles' domestic stresses as Guy becomes increasingly  inspired to do what he can to promote democracy, in Roumania, in Greece, in  Egypt.This adaption of the books by Olivia Manning is wonderful and its  length is a great advantage as the viewer is drawn into the plot and  circumstances. It is an account of the war that could not have been told in  an hour and thanks to the beautiful photography and subtle portrayals of  Manning's chracters, it makes a wonderful historical companion while  telling a captivating story.",N/A
318201,"After the excellent FRANKENSTEIN MEETS THE WOLFMAN,this one seems a bit of a letdown. Karloff and Naish are escaped criminals hoping to follow in Frankenstein's footsteps, who pose as horror show operators so that Karloff  can get revenge against those who put him in jail. Karloff releases Dracula  from limbo so the vampire can kill Karloff's enemy. Carradine delivers a  finer performance than the next movie, but Dracula gets a little too much  screen time for a movie with a title monster FRANKENSTEIN. After Dracula is  killed Karloff frees the monster and the werewolf from ice, in hopes that  they'll get Frankenstein's diary for him. Sadly, this is where it slows  down. The only problem is the love triangle with the gypsy girl that is  pointless. If she was taken out, the film would be better. We only see the  Wolfman slash one throat, and they never show it!  Glen Strange is a  perfect monster look next to Karloff, but the title monster only gets to do  two quick scenes of action. In the next film,the scenes with the monster  are mainly stock footage. That is a major rip off. Dracula existing is  rather pointless in this film and only takes up time so the real monsters  this movie's about are rushed in. Still an okay movie watch it for fun.",N/A

(Sail Away, Why Can't I?, Poor Butterfly...) She also reprises two songs from earlier in the series. (Old Man River, As Long As He Needs Me) Episode #24 is also a concert show with guest Vic Damone.

Even the presence of the artless Keanu Reeves works - there are few actors who could more genuinely express Neo's confusion and sense of being out-of-place than Reeves  (perhaps b/c he isn't acting). The superb Agent Smith should have been a  shoe-in for a Supporting Actor nomination - and doubtless would have been  had this not been an sf film.

392565,"Wonderfully made biblical epic which I caught on a late night channel. The well known story of the judean prince Judah Ben-Hur who is sold into slavery by his best friend remains a popular one in our family now going in  to the third generation.Also as an added side interest is the pivotal but  harrowing story of Christ and the crucifixtion complete with miracles &amp;  choral singing. Despite the deeply religious overtones it is replete with  human conflicts. Love, betrayal, faith... and a chariot race at the end to  upstage any car chase scene Bruce Willis ever did.I was impressed with  the supporting cast especially Jack Hawkins as Ben-Hur's adopted father and  australian actor Frank Thring as Pontius Pilate. But the acting laurels  must go to Hugh Griffith,as they certainly did at the 1963 Academy  awards,for his role as Sheikh Ilderim.  A rather uncouth big-hearted but  marvellously animated owner of a chariot racing stable who loves to  gamble,hates the romans and enjoys a good fight.He is a pleasure to watch  and at times provides some comic relief in this sombre &amp; sonorous epic.  Gore Vidal,interviewed in  &quot;the Celluloid Closet&quot; provides us  with some interesting anecdotes about the writing of the script especially  the double-edged innuendos which amazingly made it past the strict  censorship of the time. Every one seemed to have fun with it including  Stephen Boyd who plays Messala.Only Chuck Heston didnt get the joke Vidal  recalls. Perhaps his staunch republicanism would not have seen the humour  of it. Despite the sacriligious perfidy of Vidal &amp; co it is still a  very watchable film and i recommend it to all new generations.Give it a go.  Phantom Menace has nothing on this!",N/A

It is great to see a movie of this genre where all the effects are up front (and therefore out of the way)  leaving loads of space and time for character and plot development. It  reminded me of Pi and Dark City in so far as you can draw parallels with  our present world (the box says fear, paranoia, suspicion and desperation)  and you are left to draw your own conclusions rather than having someone  tell you the meaning. Great idea and convincingly acted. If you want to see  an interesting film that will have you talking about it for weeks  afterwards, watch this.",Cube

Lately, with  the release of DVD, I decided to watch it one evening when I've nothing  better to do.  My intuition about the storyline being too good to be true  was right.

Plus, it was made at a time when 'gay pride' was new, so there  are some 'man on the street' interviews form a pride celebration which have  nothing to do with the movie.The story is timeless though.  It's the  constant 'gay' struggle of sex vs love.  Our hero tried to make a  relationship with someone who isn't sure he wants love, but is our hero too  interested in a domestic life and canot see the forest for the trees?  I  think this is a subject ALL of us go through as we search for relationships  in our lives.  This movie could be made today and the storyline would be  exactly the same.

150819,"I hesitated before viewing DODSWORTH; the title can throw you off, the reprts that it is neither a tragedy nor a comedy; and even, from those who have seen it, the European settings are not interesting (you mainly see the  interior of hotel rooms).  But wait!  It turns out to be a superbly crafted  film, well-edited, beautifully paced, well acted (Ruth Chatterton on the  weak side, perhaps, but Walter Huston and Mary Astor, especially, as good  as they ever get!)  The most important thing I can say about DODSWORTH is  that it is one of those rare movies that you experience rather than see,  that you feel you're growing older and wiser even as the characters on the  screen grow older and wiser.  The ending is an absolutely perfect  realization of the story line; indeed it resolves issues that were there  all along, just like a brilliant Agatha Christie ending.  This movie is no  detective story, of course, but it is plotted and realized with the same  impeccable logic.  I'm very stingy with Amazon's allotment of stars, and  while I would give DODSWORTH four and a half stars if half-stars were  available, it doesn't have quite the impact of AN AFFAIR TO REMEMBER, a  movie which DODSWORTH calls to mind for many structural reasons (but not  directly plot-wise).  What a joy it would have been to see Walter Huston on  the Broadway stage!  But since few people alive today can have seen him  there, he is preserved for us in DODSWORTH in a role so well acted that you  never for a second think he's acting.",N/A

The plot was fascinating, an inside look of the workings of the L.A.P.D in  the 50's. The directing, cinematography, all of the designings were  astounding. Its also one of those rare films that the script pretty much  stick to the novel. The acting was flawless, Kevin Spacey, Russell Crowe  (in a powerhouse performance) and Guy Pierce were all overlooked at Oscar  time. It truly is one of the best movies of the 90's, right up there with  American Beauty, Saving Private Ryan and Schindlers List. If you havent  seen this movie yet, go out and rent it, and I doubt you'll be  dissapointed.

546501,"It has been many years since I have seen the entire first season - I've watched only a select few episodes in between. Now, with the DVD release I have watched it all again and I find that the series is as enjoyable as  ever. This time its interesting to note some of the in-jokes (eg the  appearance of the name Tom Braidwood).Most people who will buy or want  to buy this DVD know what the series is about. For those who have some idea  but perhaps are not familiar with the earlier episodes - there are great  episodes and there are not so great episodes. As someone once said, X-Files  season one at its worst is better than most other series. I agree with this  and find that even the poorer episodes (Jersey Devil, for one) are quite  watchable.The entire first season is split over six discs with TV spots  etc on a seventh disk. Sadly the missing scenes turn out to be two minor  scenes, both from the pilot episode and only serve to show us what might  have been ie Scully's boyfriend.That said, the transfer is excellent and  the sound quality is magnificent. The box set is a little flimsy (mine is  already showing signs of wear and tear and that's only because I've been  watching the episodes over the period of one week)and to be honest I would  prefer the sturdy cases used for the Star Trek releases.Transfer - 5  out of 5 Extras - 3 out of 5 Packaging - 1 out of 5Still, I can't wait  for Season Two onwards to be released.",The X-Files - The Complete First Season

424047,"Richard Attenborough's story of the relationship between Ernest Hemingway and Anges von Kurowsky (the inspiration behind the novel A Farewell to Arms) is recounted in this film.  It is truly an epic film, covering the last year of the First World War, during which time Hemingway was injured while a member of the Red Cross, to his meeting and blossoming love for Kurowsky, to the pensive, melancholy conclusion to their relationship after the war.The film has a rich, sweeping feel to it.  Attenborough does a wonderful job at direction, blending the gorgeous cinematography (from Italian battlefields to Venician waterways) with the loving, at-times heart-wrenching musical score.  However, the film is not manipulative, as most recent romance films are.  Instead, it is allowed to unfold slowly and naturally, and it has a more honest feel to the characterizations than you find in most mainstream Hollywood films.On its initial release, one of the main complaints about the film was the unusual casting of Chris O'Donnell as Hemingway and Sandra Bollock as Kurowsky.  In actuality, Bollock gives a very commendable performance, and I believe this film shows her best acting to date.  In most of her other films, she just plays Sandra Bollock with a different name, but here, she suppresses her usual idiosyncrasies and creates a true character.  While I enjoyed a lot of her other films (Speed, While You Were Sleeping), this is really her best and most underrated performance.  O'Donnell is somewhat less successful - it is hard to imagine him as a young Hemingway, and he seems like an anachronistic Boy Wonder.  His mannerisms don't seem to fit with a 1910s mentality.  However, he is not terrible, as some reviewers might have you believe.  He delivers a decent performance; in fact, if you drop any pre-conceived notions of the real Ernest Hemingway and try to view O'Donnell's character as just another spunky youth caught in the excitement of wartime, his performance works well in the context of the film.Personally, I like this film a lot.  It's gorgeous, it's romantic, and it feels like a sweeping epic.  If you enjoy films like The English Patient or A Room with a View, you'll enjoy this film.Just a few words about the DVD, which I bought....this is an essentially bare-bones DVD.  There are the usual small extras (subtitles, trailer, cast notes) but nothing else.  You can choose to view it as widescreen or full-screen.  But there is no commentary or documentary...So, if you like romantic films, give this film a chance....you may be surprised at how it slipped by your notice.  Recommended!",In Love and War 1996  VHS

13914,"I've never been able to understand the beef critics had with this movie.  Yes, it's violent.  Seeing Madeleine Stowe's character turned into a  heroin-addicted prostitute is hard to watch.  But does this make it a bad  movie?  Or is it bad because Costner's character seeks revenge, and offs  some bad guys?  I suspect that Stowe's character's fate has most to do with  why this movie was so broadly panned.  Much of this movie is brutal.  Is  this worse, though, than showing violence that doesn't seem to hurt?  Gunfights in which the heroes get shot and just shake it off?  I don't  think so.  The violence in this movie is brutal because the story demands  it.There isn't more to say, probably, than has already been said, but I  found the narrative well-paced, the characters believeable, and the story  compelling.  The final confrontation was wholly plausible, and the right  denouement for the film: both redemptive and logical given what we know  about the characters.This is a sadly underrated movie, one well-worth  seeing.",N/A
512274,"I can only thank my lucky stars that I was in a hurry when I picked up &quot;The Last Broadcast&quot; at my local rental store. I didn't read the case properly and thought I had chosen a movie about some grisly murders in  New Jersey. So,when I got home, I was surprised to be confronted with what  seemed to be a bona fide documentary. I became totally engrossed in what  became the increasingly unnerving story of an ill fated, overambitious  cable TV expedition to out the Jersey Devil. &quot;Spying in on this crime  about to happen&quot; to quote the character Clare Deforest was infinitely  more chilling than watching some chump in an anorak hacking up preening  college students. I have read at least one review which cites the  amateurish production and acting and the monotone delivery of narrator  David Beard as negative factors. This is essentially why the film works. It  had the right low budget feel of a documentary you might see on a minor  network channel. Most cable shows are amateurish affairs to say the least  and the unsure, almost unprepared delivery of Avalos and Weiler made them  seem all the more natural and real. The location video footage was grainy,  badly focussed and shaky.....exactly what you would expect! With the finest  actors Hollywood has to offer and million dollar camera equipment, the film  would have been unconvincing and much less satisfying.  As to whether  &quot;The Last Broadcast&quot; or &quot;The Blair Witch Project&quot; came  first...who cares. They are both worthwhile, ingenious movies and  infinitely more disturbing than any of the big bucks frighteners Hollywood  had to offer during the 90's.  So, accept the amateurism evident in  &quot;The Last Broadcast&quot; as vital to its success and be prepared to  be confronted by an all too real and believable murder mystery. Of course,  if you've read this far, you're not likely to be as dumbstruck as I was at  the conclusion and perhaps the best advice I can give you is not to read  the plot synopsis on the back of any horror or suspense video...the less  you know, the more scared you get!",N/A

478204,"Well, it was inevitable that anime would become the next big thing.  After creatively bankrupting traditional American animation techniques, it was only a matter of time before something bigger and better came along (not necessarily &quot;new&quot;).  If you're like me, most anime that you run across is dismal, insipid and takes a tremendous knowledge of backstory before you even watch one episode (even THAT'S hard to do considering there's so many different incarnations of every anime).  Anime has been around a long time and has only recently come to be the &quot;next big thing&quot;.  Unfortunately, much of it really isn't that interesting but once in a great while one comes along that's actually worth paying attention to.  This is where Cowboy Bebop comes in. Fairly easy to get into, the episodes move along at such a pace that each is enjoyable and most stand alone (only a handful connect to each other and even then it's not necessary to have seen the episode that preceeds it).  Full of interesting concepts, dry wit, complex characters and even a bit of slapstick, the crew of Bebop try hard to entertain and, most often, succeed.  The only downside is that the episodes tend to go from one extreme to the next (one episode is played for laughs while the next is purely drama; sometimes it's a letdown).  Also a bonus is the fact that the female characters are not reduced to vapid, irritating whiners who seem to lose their clothes at the most inopportune moments (those of you who know anime, know what I'm talking about).  They actually have brains and a personality, a rare commodity in many an anime.  The music as well deserves recognition.  Composed by Yoko Kanno, her versatility is heard throughout many of her works ranging from Bebop Jazz to Ska influence to old fashioned Bluegrass.  Her work is undeniably brilliant and is a welcome change from the usual electronica scores of most anime.  All in all a well-rounded anime that deserves the hype lamented upon it.",Cowboy Bebop - Session 1

The three principal players -- Christopher Reeve, Jane Seymour, and Christopher Plummer -- are all excellent.

400064,"An extremely stylish film with great production values, but far too abridged in movie form.  It only runs 78 minutes (a far cry from the 115 minutes listed in the specifications here as of this review!), and the  story's depth and scope suffers quite obviously in its adaptation to this  media because of its relative brevity, equally obviously due to the expense  and effort involved in developing animation of this quality.  One gets the  unavoidable sense that there's an incredible story behind Ghost in the  Shell, easily worth several hours of storytelling, but that its surface is  only barely scratched in this film.  Events happen too quickly, too little  is explained beforehand or afterward, and the final credits start scrolling  before much of real substance has taken place and before the viewer knows  what's really happening.  I consider it really unfortunate; a true  injustice to the story's potential, but unfortunately nothing new to anime  adaptations (see Battle Angel Alita, for another, even better example).  Ultimately, readers of this review will want the answer to one basic  question: is it worth owning?  Sadly, in my view it isn't; while the  audience's glimpse of its beautiful, stylish cyberpunk world is not without  its rewards, it is ultimately too brief and disjointed to have continued  viewing value, especially for those who are not intimately familiar with  the original manga (comic book).  You may, quite reasonably, disagree and  enjoy this film for whatever it does bring to the table, in which case you  would find it worth its purchase price.  If, however, like me, you find  that unfinished potential animation masterpieces like Battle Angel Alita  and Lord of the Rings are more a source of mourning than enjoyment, you'd  do best to steer clear of buying this DVD, and simply rent it.",N/A
454579,"Okay, first of all, to Masonx, Ryan Phillippe is not Canadian. Back to the point....This movie had tons of potential. I was really looking foward to seeing it.  Having been born in 1978 I did most of my growing in the 90's  so there was never a time that sex was safe and drugs were not addictive. I  find that period of freedom fascinating and 54 was where the party was.  I'm sure this movie was going somewhere very interesting before the studio  got a hold of it. Laced with sex, drugs, homosexuality and energy, as that  time was, the original cut was probably very good. But, alas, someone got  nervous and added these horrible scenes, and cut the heart out of the film.  They beefed up Neve's role, which was bad, beefed up Mike Myers role, which  he played well but it just didn't work, and just plain messed up the movie.  You can tell all the stuff that was reshot by Ryan's afro wig which looks  nothing like real hair. Watch the original trailer to see things that look  good but never made the final cut. I'm sad to see the DVD has no deleted  scenes, and no Director's Cut edition, I would like to see the real film.  And until these become available, don't waste your time.

332008,"This above statement no make no sense to many of you out there,but let me explain. This is my feelings of this film. When watching many different  movies it's important that you pay close attention to what you HEAR instead  of what you SEE. The dialogue is the most important thing in the movie.  Think of the films of Martin Scorsese or Spike Lee. If you miss certain  parts of the dialogue you'll be lost for the whole rest of the story. But  that's not the case with this masterpiece by Kubrick. There is I believe  only 40 minutes of dialogue. So basically your just looking at your screen  and watching something you'll never forget. The screenplay done here by  Kubrick and Clarke is amazing. This will turn our to be a one of a kind  movie you will never forget.Which is all due to the astonishing images  projected on screen. Kubrick really out did himself and set a very high  standard for others to try and reach. A must for movie fans!",N/A

116796,"The greatest Hong Kong action film ever made is an American film.The Matrix had been looking like an excellent film ever since the first previews of it were shown. And thankfully, it really does live up to its looks. It meets and exceeds all high hopes and expectations awaiting it. It is a gorgeous, visionary, and revolutionary film, one of the best films of 1999, indeed one of the greatest films of all time.The thing that stands out the most in The Matrix is its awesome and well-crafted action: numerous weapons, high-tech shootouts, maneuvering and dodging unlike in any other film, reality-bending moves and motion that makes other actions films' fight scenes seem slow and weak in comparison thanks to their powered-up and enhanced environment... and hand-to-hand martial-arts combat scenes that are among the most complicated, fast, clever, original, and fun fighting scenes of action films, if not simply the best. Thanks to the premise of the film the characters can move and fight in such enhanced and extraordinary ways that it makes all other action films seem slow in comparison.The excellent and sophisticated direction keeps the action alive: beautiful stop-motion and slow-motion use combined with extremely impressive 360-degree rotating and panning of the camera; wonderful cinematography, overall, which compliments and helps the action to be as great as it is.There's another thing The Matrix does right. In almost all other martial arts films, the fighting form is ruined by its dependence on props and humor sketches. I saw Romeo Must Die recently. It had a bad plot, but that wasn't its only problem. The fight scenes lost all excitement and turned into cliche when Jet Li used things such as bag string and a water hose to fight his enemies. Other times, the entire fight would be devoted to achieving a stupid sight gag, such as the enemy thugs having their pants fall down. How cute. In other words, the fights turned into cheap Jackie Chan-style theatrics. They used everything as a weapon except actual martial arts. The Matrix does not do this. It knows not to fool around with its action. It uses pure, graceful combat. Apparently, this is a new idea. How ironic it is that an American film knows how to do martial arts better than most recent Hong Kong films.The story propelling and surrounding this action and stylish camerawork goes like this: Keanu Reeves' character, Neo, finds out that he (along with the rest of humanity) is living in a fake world in a fake 1999: the world he lives in is one huge virtual reality environment pulled down over people's eyes. This virtual world is known as The Matrix. And the real world, above them, contains the humans' rulers and enslavers- a culture of robots using The Matrix to enslave humans and drain them of energy, while they are being controlled, to fuel their machines. Only a handful of people, led by Morpheus (Laurence Fishburne), know this truth. They search for &quot;The One&quot; who will be able to overthrow humanity's rulers- and they find him, seemingly, in Neo.So to go along with the thrills there is a quality story, too, unique and well-made. It's an intriguing premise and an interesting vision of the future. There are thought-out scientific and electronic scenarios, which let the action be crazy as it is. And through the themes on reality and its relativity, the power of belief, the concept of mind-over-body, Bible symbolism (from The One to to Nebuchadnezzar to Zion to Trinity, it's there), and even Cartesian philosophy the film presents its tantalizing message with cleverness: let your mind go. Take the pill.The acting is the sole dent (however small, as will be explained) of this otherwise wonderful film. Fishburne was very good, composed and only sometimes corny. Carrie-Anne Moss was good, too. But Keanu Reeves seemed dull, droll, and without enough emotion inside him. Sometimes he even recites his lines without any real inflection in his tone of voice, making him sound somewhat fake. But then again, this film isn't a drama, it's an action film, and any action film that tries to be a drama and tries to have its actors be dramatic is pointless. The Matrix doesn't fall into this trap and successfully negates Reeves' empty acting by having the focus on the action, not the dialogue/drama. The total 15 minutes or so of serious drama/exposition that Reeves is in doesn't, in the long run, diminish the quality of the film at all.The Matrix is near-perfect; it is one of, if not the, single most diverse and clever action films of all time; not many films reach this level of originality and vision, and when they do, like this one, they remind me why I love movies so clearly. It's one of the greatest films of all time. Even if it only had superb action and nothing else like plot or direction, it would still be great. Do yourself a favor and see it. And buy it.PS: This isn't directly related to the film, but I must say one thing I don't like about this film's popularity is how it seems to have spawned all this backlash against Star Wars: The Phantom Menace! Look, both are excellent films, leave TPM alone.",N/A
70810,"&quot;Mystery Men&quot; is one of my favorite movies and a delightful comedic romp through all the cliches of super-hero tales. It tells the tale of seven superheroes: the Shoveler, who must fight and shovel his way to  justice; Mr. Furious, whose power comes from his boundless rage; the Blue  Raja, my personal favorite, who is the master of cutlary and speaks with an  English accent, which really makes sense if you know your history;  Invisible Boy, who can use his powers only when no one, including himself,  is looking at him; the Bowler, my other favorite, who is the daughter of a  bowling superhero and and now controlls a bowling ball that has her  father's skull preserved inside of it (&quot;Did you put your father's  skull in that ball?&quot;  &quot;No, of course not!  The guy at the pro  shop did it.&quot;); the Spleen, otherwise known as Peewee Herman, who will  show you his power if you pull his finger; and the Sphinx, who is  mysterious, _terribly_ mysterious, and can bend iron and stuff with his  mind, and offers such pearls of wisdom like, &quot;If you do not control  your anger, your anger will control you,&quot; and &quot;If you have doubt  about your powers, your only power will be your doubt.&quot; When Champion  City's professional superhero, Captain Amazing, is put out of commission  (&quot;Don't touch _any_ more toggels!&quot;), the only thing standing  between Casanova Frankenstein, along with gangs like the Disco Boys, the  Frat Boys, and the Ladies Dressed To Kill, are seven wanna-be heroes. And  it's their own conviction, determination, and blind luck that cause them to  succeed. I personally found this movie to be hilarious. Seinfeld meets  Superheroes, in that all of their discussions are about the silly things no  one thinks about in the usual worlds of superheroes: &quot;Lance Sterling  is _not_ Captain Amazing. Lance Sterling wears glasses, Captain Amazing  _doesn't_ wear glasses.&quot;  &quot;He takes them off when he  transforms!&quot;  &quot;Now, that doesn't make any sense. How would he be  able to see?&quot; It's so silly it's funny. I love the characters,  especially Hank Azaria's Blue Raja. I adore Hank Azaria and he is wonderful  in this film. The thought of a fork-flinging super hero is hilarious. His  accent makes the character.  And The Bowler is delightful. She may be the  only girl on the team; but she never becomes a romantic interest  (finally!). Maybe it's because I've always had a love for super heroes that  I enjoy this movie so much. But the heroes with humor are always the  enjoyable ones. The Disney character &quot;Darkwing Duck&quot; continues to  be my favorite super hero out there *g*, and &quot;Mystery Men&quot;  continues in that vein. Give it a chance.

36471,"The first time the world heard this story, it left enough of an impression that we're still telling it two millenia later.  That this time the story has come from the pen of Stephen King is no surprise to those of us who  have felt before the deep spirituality that often hides within King's  writings.  The Green Mile is as disturbing a film as any  I've seen: the  script, the acting, and the cinematography are crafted to lend an air of  historical authenticity to the terrible story which unfolds, so that we  wonder if we might stumble someday upon the graves of the men we watch die.  Indeed, much of King's signature genius lies in weaving together elements  of fiction which COULD easily be fact, before injecting a story with a  supernatural tone which challenges belief.  And director Frank Darabont has  done a masterful job of using those truth-cored elements to support-almost  overshadow-the miraculous events which surround a mysterious death row  inmate.  But there's something more, something messianic, about John  Coffey; at each turn we fall deeper into a soul-rending romance with the  doomed innocent, ashamed of ourselves for the fear he inspires in  us.Coffey (&quot;like the drink, but not spelt the same&quot;), a burly  black transient in 1935 Louisiana, has been arrested and convicted for the  brutal murder of two young girls.  His tearful, sobbing defense-&quot;I  tried to take it back, but it was too late&quot;-is as enigmatic as  &quot;you have said so,&quot; and gives us reason from the outset to  believe that the &quot;jury of his peers&quot; was wrong to condemn him.  Rather, as the story unfolds, we begin to understand that John Coffey, like  another figure with similar initials, has spent his life-and in fact is  doomed to GIVE his life-seeing and feeling the pain, injury, and shame of  others.  The miracle is that Coffey is able to take in all that ugliness,  feel it and own it, and then cast it away, literally on the wind.  Coffey  feels joy just as deeply and powerfully as he feels pain.  Life to him is  exhausting; we finish the film wondering if any of the other characters on  the screen-and if we ourselves-have even begun to live life as fully as he  has.  Coffey's unearthly power infects the lives of every person he meets,  whether death row inmate, prison guard, or cancer patient.  None, having  met John Coffey, will ever be the same.King closes &quot;It,&quot;  another of his novels, with a challenge: &quot;there are so many happy  endings that the man who says he does not believe in God needs to have his  rationality called into serious question.&quot;  The Green Mile does  nothing to disprove this dictum.  In fact, this story, for all of its  gut-wrenching awfulness, for all of its sorrow and injustice, still  radiates the presence of God in the midst of, and in spite of, the shame of  humanity.  It is, in essence, a story of Grace and Redemption.",N/A

453478,"As you will know by now, this is the surrealistic movie of a man who's grown up in a controlled environment, his life broadcast on television, and with every aspect of his life planned by a corporation. It's a story with many levels of questions and interpretations, from the obvious to the existential. How far would television executives go for ratings? How much right does the public have to know all the details of someone's life? How much are we controlled by others? What is the nature of reality?However, simply as an allegory for middle-class life, it works extremely well and is deeply moving. When Truman begins to yearn to know more of the world, the people around him conspire to keep him in his claustrophobic environment, using guilt and manipulation. He has an aging mother, he has a job, he has a mortgage, he has friends, he has a wife who wants a baby - he is expected to be settled and happy. When he tries to interject a change of routine into his life despite their admonishments, he's thwarted by `acts of God'. Jim Carrey was perfectly cast as Truman, making the innocence and wistfulness of the character believable, as was Ed Harris as the god-like director who's both loving and wrathful towards his creation. The 1950's look to the controlled environment harks back to a time many people still think of as domestically ideal, a time when we had no doubts in our beliefs of what was right and proper and what wasn't.But perhaps the simplest message in it is that until we can overcome the expectations and limitations others impose on us, we will never be free.",N/A
373340,"&quot;Glen or Glenda&quot; aims to make people aware of the anguish  transvestites suffer as they try to find acceptance. It is a serious, powerful, thought-provoking  drama. Or at least, that was the idea. As things turned out, Ed Wood's opus became one of the worst films ever made.It's hard to describe a film like this. Basically it tells the story of a young man called Glen who likes the feel of women's clothes. Should he tell his fiance? While Glen is trying to decide, we see Bela Lugosi talk about nothing that makes any sense, listen to narration that is priceless, and watch a heap of stock footage interspersed with dream sequences.I wonder if the director who remade &quot;Psycho&quot;(another film with a transvestite) had seen this. He also included unrelated footage (for when the murders took place): storm clouds for the first victim and a buffalo for the second. It's quite a coincidence because Ed Wood also used buffalo footage.This film is bad. But it's worth seeing for the performance delivered by Delores Fuller, and the sentimental music as we reach the scene where Glen &quot;reveals all&quot; to his fiance. The film alternates between boredom and hilarity. There are parts where the film is just plain dull.

116960,"I am really tempted to say that I enjoyed this better than the book. It is almost unbelievable what a great job the director did in capturing the essence of this play concerning moral ambiguity in a political setting. It was a true blessing that the director managed to gather James Mason, John Gielgud, and Marlon Brando together. Mason is very convincing as the good and honest Brutus who sees a world where everyone is as honest and honorable as he. Gielgud portrays the ambitious (but not without redeeming features) Cassius well. Brando is over the top as the back stage player Antony who eventually emerges as the most powerful character in the play. The effects are simple but good. The scenery is well done (especially considering the limited resources at the time). One fine addition (not in the book) is when Antony's archers defeat Cassius. Modern special effects may have their place, but these actors showed that it takes real acting to tell the story. I can not overestimate how much Mason, Brando, and Gielgud had their fully 3 dimensional characters down to the very core of the essences created by the master of literature William Shakespeare.",N/A
431967,"Invariably, every movie reviewed here is claimed to be &quot;THE BEST MOVIE EVER&quot; by someone.  While that's an entirely subjective view, I can state that this is MY favorite nmovie.  This DVD version only enhances  my appreciation of this film.Even before it opened, this flick generated  controversy due to the overlying plot.  It garnered diametric reviews.  Very few people felt lukewarm about this movie (as seems to be the case  with all of Kevin Smith's films.)  You either loved it or hated it.  While  there's no accounting for taste, I'd venture to guess that most people who  hated it simply didn't &quot;get&quot; it.This movie is NOT, at its  heart, about a guy who falls in love with a lesbian.  It's about the  (usually male) insecurities that are brought into a relationship, and the  damage that they cause.  It's about the destruction of (again usually male)  friendships that a new relationship often brings.  It's about how lessons  are learned, usually too late.  Just about everyone I've watched this film  with is able to say, &quot;Yeah, I've done that.&quot;  Or, &quot;Yep,  that's happened to me.&quot;  Or, &quot;Ha!  I know exactly how he  feels.&quot;  Chaing Amy is the most realistic look at relationships that  I've ever seen.  I'd be willing to bet that most of the folks who didn't  &quot;get&quot; it, have never had a bad relationship or more likely never  had a relationship at all.The acting job by the leads is great.  Ben  Affleck is every guy.  A little overconfident, totally in love, willing to  do anything, and a complete and utter idiot because of it.  Joey Lauren  Adams shows that she's so much more than a disctinctive voice.  She has the  most powerful performances of the film, and it's obvious how much emotion  she put into them.The DVD is spectacular.  It's basically everything  from the previous laserdisk release, with a new intro in which Kevin Smith  explains his &quot;F@#% DVD&quot; comment on the commentary track.  The  commentary track alone is worth the price of the DVD.  It's easily the best  View Askew commentary so far.  The  banter between Smith &amp; Affleck is  hilarious.  Along the way they also explain some of the concepts behind the  film &amp; its meaning.  If the Chasing Amy detractors would watch this  commentary, it's likely that alot of them would see the movie in a new  light and change their tune.  Along with the commentary are 10 deleted  scenes.  Most are funny, but it's obvious why they were removed.  The  unused intro though, is classic and something that every Kevin Smith fan  needs to see.This is a comedic character/dialog driven movie.  If you  want an extremely intelligent witty human look at relationships, you'll  LOVE this movie.  If you're looking for gloss and effects, go elsewhere.",Chasing Amy VHS

I was ten when I first saw it and felt a little frightened  and depressed when I left the theater.  But now I appreciate Watership Down  for the wonderful film it is.  It is an autumnal movie, stark and sad, but  somehow very affirming in the end  ( in its, frankly, bleak way).  This is  animation expression at its best, and nothing has topped W Down since.  It  ain't singing animals, so be warned.  But what these animals do is far more  rewarding than a power ballad.  SEE IT!",N/A
10774,"Here is a romantic comedy which you can view more than once. Properous, successful, anti-social, and almost cripplingly obessive-compulsive, Melvin, Jack Nickolson's character falls for Carol (Helen Hunt), a waitress in the restaurant where he habitually eats in Manhatten. She, single mother, living with her mother and chronically sick son in the hinterlands of Brooklyn, by virtue of her warm but no nonsense personality, begins to draw Melvin out of his pathology and back into the land of the living. Cuba Gooding, Jr (Jerry MaGuire), Greg Kinnear (Nurse Betty) and Shirley Knight (The Group) supply some good supporting acting. The script and direction by James L. Brooks (check out his wonderful montage as Carol, unable to sleep in the middle of the night, urgently travels to Manhatten to tell Melvin something that can't wait) make this film extraordinary.  But it's Helen Hunt's performance that raises this film yet another notch. Somehow, in her long TV career, she has mastered her craft, learned a marvelous range of ways to communicate with her face, learned to stretch (sort of like rubato in music) time to increase the impact of her acting, learned an integrity of performance which will take your breath away. Don't miss it.",N/A

It will never be considered a classic but for this genre of Adam Sandler and Jim Carrey, it's a perfect comparison.  The story of a  poor guy who has been under mind-control of mormonism and then gets  transplanted out to California to actually make his own choices in life.  I  can't say I agree with adult movies, but after living the life he had to,  well, he finally gets out of Utah and that is reward enough.

Robin Hood is a sly fox who outwits the sheriff, the king, and their men  time and again, and Marian is a foxy fox.  King Richard and Prince John are  lions -- symbol of the king of beasts, and the prince's main counselor is a  snake, low creature that snakes are viewed as being.  The guards are often  rhinos, tough, strong, but not expected to think.I truly enjoy this  telling, but there are several places in the movie where it's clear that  the animation from one part of the movie was reused in another part of the  movie.  That detracts somewhat from the viewing experience.The music and  characters were fun, and you come to loathe the prince and his snake  friend, not to mention OLD BUSHELL BRITCHES the sheriff of Nottingham.A  fun show, but not quite up to snuff with more recent Disney offerings.

Suspenseful, funny, sexy, exciting, it works perfectly on so many levels that the film just gets better and better with repeated viewings!The story is really quite simple; a successful New York ad executive (Cary Grant, in superb form!) is mistaken for an American espionage agent by a group of Soviet spies (led by the ruthlessly suave James Mason, and his aide, a youthful yet sinister Martin Landau! ), and a cat-and-mouse cross-country chase begins, culminating on top of Mount Rushmore. Along the way, Grant is ridiculed by his mother (Jesse Royce Landis, who is hilarious, if actually YOUNGER than Grant!), seduced by double-agent Eva Marie Saint (in the sexiest role of her career!), chased across a cornfield by a lethal cropduster (in one of the greatest scenes in film history!), and recruited into the intelligence community (represented by future 'Man from U.N.C.L.E.' boss, Leo G. Carroll!), while Bernard Herrman's unforgettable music punctuates each scene!Yes, the film has it's faults and a few technical gaffes, but for sheer excitement and fun, you can't top 'North By Northwest'!

G.I.Joe the comic was supposed to be more realistic and the whole Cobra-La thing really got them irritated.  If one looks at the various villians, how many could have stepped over to the X-Men universe? The best part of the movie, besides introducing Lt.

Although  &quot;Showgirls&quot; has been shunned by the mainstream public, it has  gained quite a bit of fame as a cult classic, such as &quot;Plan 9&quot;.  &quot;Showgirls&quot; became infamous after being slapped with the dreaded  NC-17 rating, the scarlet &quot;A&quot;, if you will, of the rating system.

As time has passed I've grown more honest with myself, and a lot more realistic  about Diana Ross and the sad fact that she has a propensity to pick and  perform mediocre material.Mahogany is a perfect example of one of those  projects that on it's face had potential but was ruined by the hacks who  were hired to bring it to the screen. First, Berry Gordy fired Tony  Richardson the original director because he didn't know how to achieve  ""Blackness"" in his direction. Then, he (Gordy) takes over the direction and  goes for every Hollywood cliche he can pack into one film.The plot is  the tired story of a poor working class girl who makes good in the fashion  world and then throws it all away to go back to a life of failure just to  be with the man she loves. Let's face it, this story has been told so many  times before, it has become it's own genre.Ross plays Tracy Chambers,  the heroine in our story, with style and intensity, and she even manages to  win you over in a few scenes but just when you think things are getting  better, something really dumb happens.Billy Dee Williams plays a loser  politician who spouts out more BS in his speeches than any real politician  ever has in real life. If you had the chance you would definitely vote for  the other guy.  Tracy had it right when she left this jerk.Tony Perkins  plays a crazed homosexual trying to prove to himself he's not really gay by  making love to Tracy, in a scene that feels so sleezy that you'll want to  shower after viewing it.To be fair there are a few moments in this  melodrama that give you a look at the immense talent that was wasted here,  like where Brian and Tracy have a huge fight and she tells him she dosn't  need him, (Very good acting on Ross' part) and where Tracy helps Brian in  his campaign and tells him it's all just show biz. But the real high point  of this film is the beautifully filmed and edited fashion montage with  Diana being transformed into the glamorous Mahogany set to the instrumental  version of ""Do You Know Where You're Going To?""

Easily one of the greatest movies of all time, a MUST SEE. Winner  of the Best Picture Oscar, as well as Best Director and Screenplay. From a  scale of 1-10 I give this movie a 10! Masterpiece",N/A

Having been innundated with the crude and physical genres of comedy over the years, the subtle wit  of this film will escape many.  Still, for the rest of us it is a gem of  work, strikingly pertinent for today's global realities.  We laugh at  &quot;Strangelove&quot; because we feel we are on reprieve -- it's amazing  that we made it this far, given the moronic element that tends to rise to  positions of power.  Funny, yes.

But why must these cartoons be couched in such locker room humor and vile language?The movie was more of the same.  I watched the first 45 minutes and was just plain grossed out. If the *f*  word were removed from this movie, it'd cut out half the dialogue.Yes -  there are funny parts here and there - but the snatches of humor are lost  amidst the degradation of everything good and decent.It's like wading  through vast piles of sewage and trash to find a small perishable treasure.  The enjoyment of the occasional joke is lost amidst the stench of the  profanity and revilement.In 1946, censors derided &quot;It's a  Wonderful Life&quot; because Jimmy Stewart said &quot;nuts to you&quot; in  one scene.This movie should have an X-rating. How it came through with  the milder rating, I'll never understand.And to throw the protective  cloak of the first amendment over this flick (as a prior reviewer did) is  an afront to Elijah Lovejoy, the first martyr of the free press who laid  down his life for the first amendment.

462867,"Released in 1956, ""Bride of the Monster"" is an enjoyable schlock-fest from Grade-Z auteur Edward D. Wood, Jr. However, the film rises above its ultra-low budget thanks to the presence of Bela Lugosi. Regardless of personal and professional misfortunes, Bela plays Dr. Eric Vornoff as though it were the performance of his life. Sadly, it would be Lugosi's last starring and speaking role. Despite the amateurish supporting cast and obvious production flaws (who can forget that rubber octopus), ""Bride of the Monster"" has a comic-book charm that's hard to resist - definitely superior to Wood's ""Glen or Glenda"" (1953) and ""Plan 9 From Outer Space"" (1959). Hollywood has managed to surpass Ed Wood's cinematic ineptitude on a larger scale with ""Showgirls"" and ""Battlefield Earth."" For once, let's give the Master of Bad Cinema his due.",N/A
61448,"Amusing tale of a town liar (Whaley) who is down on his luck in obtaining and holding a job in a small Southern town.  When forced by his father to get a job or get lost, Whaley gets a job at the local Target store working  the midnight shift as the store janitor. There, he encounters Josie  (Connelly), the daughter of the richest man in town, who is hiding out in  the store past closing hours.The relationship between Whaley and  Connelly develops, and they discover each other's strengths and faults.  When two burglars break into the store to rob it blind, Whaley and Connelly  must play it cool in order to stop them. However, the beautiful Connelly  only leads all three guys into further trouble due to lust.Written by  the great John Hughes, &quot;Career Opportunities,&quot; is somewhat like a  &quot;Home Alone&quot; for teens. Hughes, who has written similar stories  in the past (e.g. &quot;Pretty in Pink&quot; &amp; &quot;Some Kind of  Wonderful&quot; have the same premise) does a good job in illustrating life  in a small town (suprisingly it does not take place in Shermer, Illinois,  the fictional town Hughes has used in his past films).While the film  starts to slow down after the discovery of the two burglars, the film ends  happily, justice served and all. The transfer to DVD is great. The only  NEGATIVE thing about the DVD version is the fact that there is no  theatrical trailer included on the disc, even though the packaging states  that there is. Whether an act of false advertising or a company error, this  leaves the owner short of all expectations we expect when we buy films in  this great format.If you are in the mood for a cute comedy involving a  geeky hero and a beautiful girl, this is the perfect film for you. Keep an  eye out for Dermot Mulroney (Julia Robert's &quot;best friend&quot; in  &quot;My Best Friend's Wedding&quot;) as one the scruffy burglars (the  other burglar is played by Dermot's real-life brother, Kieran).

51615,"Phantom Lady may have been overshadowed in 1944 by the release of the two classic noir films; Double Indemnity and Laura, yet Robert Siodmak's psychological thriller still maintains an acknowledged position among the  genre. Siodmak lures viewers through rain slicked streets, back alley jazz  clubs, and post midnight rendezvous.  Adapted from a Cornell Woolrich  novel, Phantom Lady is similar to Wollrich's later work Black Angel, in  that a man (Alan Curtis) is wrongfully accused of murder, sentenced to  death and can only depend on his secretary ( Ella Raines) who desperately  searches for the only alibi (the phantom lady) that can exonerate him.  Franchot Tone recieves top billing as a psychopathic socialite with  twitching hands, but it is twenty-three year old Ella Raines who deservedly  steals the spotlight .  As Carol &quot;Kansas&quot; Richman, she seduces  simple minded Elisha Cook Jr., an orchestra drummer, during one of his  performances.  In a classic cat &amp; mouse sequence, she trails an  uncooperative bartender through Siodmak's darkened urban landscape. The  sequence is highlighted with images and sounds of elevated subway cars,  city taxi cabs, and amplified footsteps against wet black-tops. Siodmak  created a five minute symphonic masterpiece that captured the essence of  urban trepidation.  The other eighty-two minutes should also please most  noir aficionados.",Phantom Lady VHS
27430,"I personally enjoy this film more than I do MY FAIR LADY. Howard and Hiller are perfectly suited to their respective roles as Professor Henry Higgins and Eliza Doolittle. While this version doesn't contain the music, colour photography and admittedly grander production values that MY FAIR LADY boasted, it's pure in form and a classic well worth viewing. Hiller is truly splendid in her impossible role and she makes an amazing transformation from the illiterate cockney guttersnipe to a wistful, charming lady. Granted Hiller was no raving beauty, yet she possessed an aristrocratic air about her which is something essential in the evolvement of her role - her performance deserves kudos galore. Jean Cadell does excellently as Higgin's stern Scottish housekeeper with a heart of gold: her playing is a joy to watch; even the actor who portrays Eliza's ne'er-do-well father is terrific. Howard does most commendable job as the determined, vainglorius Higgins and the Pascal production is nigh flawless for its representation of Shaw's masterpiece which was written for the 45 year-old Mrs. Patrick Campbell (who, despite her rather advanced age, was said to have given a superlative performance as Eliza Doolittle).",N/A

Well, it is unconceivable that &quot;The  Story of Us&quot; could be such a bad film, but it is that and more. The  movie tries to combine comedy and drama, and it does it very unsuccesfully,  and it also tries to do it in a Woody Allen kind of way (there's the scene  in the bed with both of Willis and Pfeiffer's character's parents) - of  course with less, less success. It has a theme song by Eric Clapton, a  good-romantic-acoustic-guitar song, but you hear so many times -every time  there is a &quot;family crisis&quot;- that by the end of the film you start  to really hate it...  There is this scene where Bruce Willis is in a  restaurant telling his best friends (who are by the way Rob Reiner and Rita  Wilson) about his break up, and then he starts to yell and cry... it's one  of the saddest scenes i've ever seen... but it is so sad because it is so  poorly acted it makes you nauseaus...

From the opening shot in the afternoon sun along the famous railroad the British built across Kenya to the closing sunset,  this film (three reels)is fabulous. The photography is stunning--out of  Aftica. The characters are brilliant, from Albert Tyburn (Trevor Eve) to  Ronald Burkitt (Michael Byrne) to Emma Fitzgerald (Susannah Harker). You  will love them, or love to hate them, but you will never forget any of  them.  There are many old favorite actors and new young actors previously  seen in many BBC productions.Tyburn has &quot;disgraced&quot; himself  as a police officer in London by taking the life of a pediphile killer who  was above the law because of diplomatic immunity. He is sent to Kenya in  lieu of prison, where he becomes the Kenyan version of the Canadian  Mountie. The time is that idyllic space between wars when Kenya was a  British colony filled with ne'er-do-wells and other Eurotrash, plus a few  good people who have no other home having been raised there or exiled like  Tyburn.  Tyburn solves a number of crimes, some of them horrendous, and  finally asks Ms. Fitzgerald to dance. This is a love story too.Ms.  Fitzgerald's character is loosely based on the avatrix Beryl Markham who  flew &quot;West With the Night&quot; and became the first person to cross  the Atlantic from Europe to North America--a much greater feat than that of  Lindbergh as she flew against the jet stream.",N/A
67129,"Being a fan of horror movies and having never seen the original 1963 film, I found myself eager to catch this remake, which looked interesting from  the theatrical trailer. However, I could have never been more mistaken. THE  HAUNTING, with its expensive special effects and large budget, looks more  like a 'tamed' episode from TV's Goosebumps than an actual feature film.  What's worse is that this incredibly dull chiller lacks what many of these  types of films require to work...chills! Infact, the only scary thing about  this flick is how DreamWorks managed to green-light this expensive dud into  production. The paper-thin plot finds a psychological researcher tricking a  group of people to staying a night at a haunted mansion in hopes of  studying them and their reactions. While the cast seems promising, they are  surprisingly wasted...Neeson especially, with Catherine Zeta Jones offering  a pretty face to look at, but nothing more. And surprisingly, I never  thought that director Jan DeBont could top the horrendous Speed 2: Cruise  Control, but once again I was wrong. All in all, THE HAUNTING was one of  1999's biggest Hollywood disappointments and, in my opinion, I would  seriously consider that you walk passed this one at the video store.  DROUGH!",N/A
453029,"Teens are a specialized niche in cinema. Teens in films are categorized as &quot;teen films&quot; because the film focuses around them.

This is one of the coolest films I've ever seen.The idea of discovering  a portal or gateway into an actor' s inside is interesting and  , at the same time, risky ( at least for the project investors ) too.But  when such a project is in the good hands of Spike Jonze and Charlie' s, the  results are bizarrely entertaining and somehow  thought-provoking.Synopsis: The miserable puppeteer / loser Craig  Schwartz, urged by his animal-loving wife Lotte, decides to find a job and  ends up working as a document filer for a company on a central business  district office building 7 and 1/2 th floor, which every time you get the  elavator opened, if it' s opened at all, alarms go off, where  floor-to-ceiling height is about  a little less or more 1.30 centimetres.  There, he finds himself have a huge crush on a well-dressed, shrewd and  cunning colleague Maxine who often treats him like a loser, and, above all,  also finds himself, by accident, a gateway to get into one of the  20th-century finest actors John Malkovich's inside for a big while.One  of 1999' s glorious achievements in terms of creativity, direction,  screenplay, cast performances and scores, Being John Malkovich provokes a  string of philosophical and metaphysical ideas of existence and immortality  in such a bizarrely interesting way, and in a way, is one of the most  creative stories of 1999.Spike Jonze, with this film, puts himself on  the centre stage where his future piece of work would be eagerly looked  forward to.Interesting Questions: 1) If you were offered a chance to be  inside of someone else of your interests to observe his private and  professional activities from his very own eyes for 20 minutes or so , just  for fun, would you  pretend not to give a fig about others' relished value  of privacy and go for it? ; 2) If you were offered  a chance to be able to  "" control "" his mind, would you go for it ?; and 3) If getting into his  very own mind and / or body means lingering on in this given world  for.....e-v-e-r, would you honestly do it ?

66324,"The Birds is one of the best Alfred Hitchcock's movies. When it was released, a lot of people did not understand the purpose and the meaning of the movie. When you see the movie at the first degree, you can think: oh  yeah this is another horror movie made for the sixties that can not  challenge with today horror movies, the special effects are very weak  compared with special effects of Jurassic park. But this is a wrong  approach of this masterpiece. Alfred Hitchcock did not intend only to  frightened people, for him this was also a story of the fight between  humanity and normality. I mean when the Birds decide to attack people,  there is no explanation, it occurs in a little town with ordinary people,  suddenly these people with their little world are engulfed in terror. When  the woman in the restaurant asks Melanie ""why are they doing this? she can  not answer because she does not know herself. This is the secret key of the  movie: normality can be easily reversed by an inexplicable incident. This  movie is very important in cinema history, it influenced a lot of directors  include George Romero and Steven Spielberg. In the Night of the living  dead, the plot is similar: a group of people is suddenly engulfed in  another level of reality. At the beginning they can not understand the  supernatural situation, but soon they are forced to face this reality if  they want to survive. You have to watch this movie with your imagination,  this is a true fantastic movie because there is no explanation of the  attitude of the birds, these ordinary birds become the element rooting the  horror in everyday. Some idiots people are obsessed by special effects,  they think that special effects are enough for the success of a movie. But,  do you really think that Jurassic Park could be remembered in the future as  a good movie ? There is neither acting nor plot in that demonstration of  numeric special effects. If you want to see dinosaurs, you could watch the  extraordinary TV documentary on the life of dinosaurs made by the BBC and  others European channels like France 3, the special effects were by far  superior of those of Jurassic park. So what is left to a movie like  Jurassic park?  Nothing! If you want a pop music, a lot of gore, blood,  idiots characters, and to be frightened like when you go to Disneyland, you  can watch I still know what you did last summer, today standard for horror  (horrible ?) movies for teenagers who want gratuitous violence and  unrealistic  blood and physical injuries.  For people who think that  special effects are bad in that movie : you can read the interview of  Richard Edlund in Cahiers du Cin&eacute;ma, juin 1982, where the supervisor of  Empire strike back special effects told us that he was very impressed by  the ambition and the complexity of  special effects of the Birds. People  who think that these marvellous special effects are bad are people who  don't know anything in history of special effects or who try to show that  they know something, these people should return to school for the  definition of special effects. He also told us that making some special  effects of Star Wars was even easier than those of the Birds because they  do not have to animate flying birds.  For myself I prefer think that my  opinion about these fantastic special effects is the same opinion of a  master of special effects.",N/A

Its one of the most brutally honest films about relationships I've ever seen.  Its also hilarious. No matter how often I've seen this film, I never quit  laughing.I also think this is a very misunderstood film by some of the  reviewers at Amazon who perceived it negatively.  Its a great depiction of  friendships, biases against homosexuality and the ability for two very  different people to fall in love. Alyssa was a very promiscuous girl who  had experienced a different lifestyle than Holden.  She did lie about  herself in a way I thought was very wrong, claiming virginity when she  wasn't.  I think she was confused and had very negative views on dating men  until she met him and he changed her perception on the opposite sex. It  wasn't meant to offend the gay community, it was a story about confusion.  To an extent, I think Alyssa became a lesbian due to her past. It shows how  the past always comes back to haunt you and how it can destroy the good  things in your life.

The comradery displayed by the actors who played the few  soldiers focused on in the regiment really added to the impact of the  story.

For me the outstanding  way the battle scenes looked and sounded was definitely worthy of praise  but the acting by Denzel Washington, Morgan Freeman, Matthew Broderick, and  everyone in the cast is what makes this such a great film. It was a great  team effort. Nobody really stood out as having a poor performance. Nobody  seemed disinterested in their work. Sure, it could be said that  &quot;Glory&quot; is way over the top and manipulated to make you feel  empathy for the soldiers. Isn't that the whole point? Isn't war itself a  bit extreme?",N/A
131103,"Sleepy Hollow is an excellent movie.  Johnny Depp is wonderful and charming with his light touches for comic relief - constant fainting and feeling sick to his stomach.  He is perfect as Crane.  All the actors did  great, especially Christopher Walken as the Headless Horseman.  You'll get  a kick out of him, great make-up.This movie has to be one of Tim  Burton's best. Nothing like Mars Attacks, which was pretty bad.  This is a  very sophisticated movie, with a perfect amount of suspension, action,  romance, and humor.  And the plot takes a nice twist and the mystery behind  the Headless Horseman is surprising.I definitely recommend this movie.  It's really entertaining and it appeals to all types.

285653,"The Official Companion reports that this episode ran undertime so was padded out painstakingly. This padding is noticable in the prologue and the set-up of a spaceship invaded by hitherto dormant space spores who grow into plants which emit lethal vapour. While we aren't shown how the spores managed to get inside the spaceship (one isn't likely to leave the ship door open) the naivety in which they are treated is the real surprise, probably influenced by how pretty they are and what attractive decor they make pre-vapour emittance. The spores resemble mushroom-shaped muffins, and the plants have cobra-like stems and large white petals. When a young Dabney Coleman as a botanist moves his face in for a closer inspection, we know what to expect. This episode was broadcast just after the release of the The Day of the Triffids film and the similarity (and solution to the problem) is evident, though these plants are passive-aggressive. Director Gerd Oswald provides enough suspense however to make this engaging viewing. Once the Earth base has to decide whether to allow the infected-shuttle to land or to be destroyed, the tension begins, aided by composer Dominic Frontiere's use of twittery strings to suggest both alien life and the rapid maturing of the spores into flowers with deadly stigma. This moment of decision is performed like a silent movie. Although the repair of a servomechanism of the shuttle was filmed in slow-mo to add time, the acrobatics are remarkeable, and the image of a bound corpse (the first victim of the vapour) buried in space evocatively gothic. Gail Kobe, who would later be in Keeper of the Purple Twilight, appears as the wife of one of the shuttle crew, and the only female in the cast. I suppose Oswald thought that her being in peril is more potent for the audience than the space shuttle rabbit. I rate this episode highly cos this time around, the &quot;bear&quot; is so feminine.",N/A

215387,"Ferris Bueller's Day Off in my opinion is one of the greatest comedy films ever made. Not only because the slick aand sly Matthew Broderick starred in it, but because the way you were actually able to feel for the charcters throughout the whole film which was full of jokes. In most comedies they just give you a story, some jokes, make you laugh, and it's over. Not with this.From the opening scene when Ferris is in his bedroom and faking sick, you know that this movie will be a great comedy with a pretty good story. Although the whole movie looking down on it as not as good as an Adam Sandler movie, you will still appreciate this movie for the brilliance of the whole film and the acting.So, in need of a real good movie that won't disappoint you, be sure to catch Ferris Bueller's Day Off.HAPPY VIEWING",N/A

Aside from the great performances by nearly all concerned, the story is - from start to finish -  riveting.At its core, it's the battle of one ordinary man's battle  between losing everything he holds dear, family and reputation, and what he  knows to be the right thing - exposing the tobacco industry's efforts to  chemically engineer cigarettes to be more addictive.  Along the way, watch  as 60 Minutes exec. producer Don Hewitt is seen caving to corporate  pressure to cut the story to shreds because the corporate division is  concerned the segment may lead to a lawsuit that will jeopardize an  unannounced sale of the network to Westinghouse and the resulting big  bonuses and salaries to corporate executives and a sleazy lawyer (is there  any other kind?) delisciously played by Gina Gershon.Russell Crowe, Al  Pacino and Christopher Plummer hold nothing back in their performances.

579736,"Based on the famous novel by Frances Hodgson Burnett, Shirley Temple plays the pampered daughter (Sara Crewe)of a British officer named Captain Crewe. The movie starts with scenes from 1899 and the entire movie revolves around the war going on in South Africa as seen from a British perspective. The cinematography is superb and this is Shirley's first picture in Technicolor. There are a few song and dance routines.When Sara and her father arrive in London, England, Captain Crewe is again called away to serve his country. Since they just arrived from India, Sara must find a school quickly so her father can leave for military duty.""Why are they sending so many soldiers daddy, if it is only going to be a little war?"" --Sara CreweIn Sara's mind, her father is invincible. She never imagines that he might not make it through the war. Since she has never been away from her father for any extended time, the separation is more difficult for her.After a tearful goodbye, the brave little Sara must face the unkind Miss Minchin who runs the Seminary for Young Ladies. Here, reputation is of the utmost concern and due to her wealthy status, she is treated well (at first).During her time at the school, she learns to ride the pony her father purchased for her. Goeffrey Hamilton is her riding instructor who falls in love with her school teacher Rose. Miss Minchin will have none of that and tries to break up the relationship. Sara has other ideas and is quite the little matchmaker as always.This is a completely delightful movie which also includes a wonderful ballet scene which is quite funny and you will laugh at many jokes throughout the movie. The little maid Becky is very cute and seems to be Sara's only true friend. When something happens to Sara's father we think she will never stop looking for him.The beauty of the Shirley Temple films is their ability to teach children something great about life. Sara's hope, optimism and polite spirit helps her to fulfill her social obligations. When someone shows her a kindness, she is quick to show them one in return. I related well to this movie as my own father had gone to India when I was very young and then took me to Africa. All I can say is I am happy he took me to Africa and didn't leave me all alone in England! He did take me to England later when I was a teenager. You will see what I mean after you see this movie.

Things go horribly, however, when DeNiro distrusts goofy Stiller from the beginning and only dislikes him more and more as the movie goes on.  Poor Stiller tries everything to gain his approval, but nothing works, and of course everything turns into a hilarious fiasco.  There are very original and funny moments in the movie, such as DeNiro's obession over his Persian cat, and the lengths Stiller goes to impress him and cover up all the mistakes he makes.

Both the film and the soundtrack have been tied up  with copyright problems for more than 20 years. Although Irving Berlin  wrote 'Annie', musical rights are controlled by the Rodgers and Hammerstein  estate, which stuck to Berlin's request that the film be effectively  removed from the market. Why? For no other reason, the legend goes, that he  hated Betty Hutton in the role. He wanted Ethel Merman, who was too old. He  accepted Judy Garland in the role, but she was 'unwell' and couldn't film  it, even though she did manage to record most of the songs.  So Betty got  the part, starring alongside Howard Keel, and the result is one of the most  rambunctiously joyous, energetic and downright wonderful musicals ever  made. A must-buy, even if Irving Berlin loathed it! I'll be getting the  DVD, and I might even replace my well-played CD -- a home-burnt CD taken  off a very old LP!  Now my hope is that Warners, which controls the old RKO  film library, will finally get around to releasing on DVD the greatest of  all American musicals -- the partnerships of Fred Astaire and Ginger Rogers  -- 'Top Hat', 'Swing Time', 'The Gay Divorcee' and all the rest.

484277,"....the second half of this film lets it down considerably as there are loads of things I love about it.  Winslet's performance is one of them.  She is very, very good as lost soul Ruth who, having been tricked into returning to her home in Australia by her family who fear for her when they discover she has got involved with a cult in India, finds herself having to clamber her way to back to sanity after having been brainwashed by an Indian guru and then, to make matters worse, gets too involved with her Exit Counsellor JP Waters, played by Harvey Keitel (not bad but could be better).  Although I already liked her as an actress my admiration for Kate Winslet as increased considerably after this.The film itself is clever, quirky and original and I love the fact that Jane and Anna Campion have added comedy to a potentially purely-serious story.  But when the film starts to move into darker waters it becomes slow and patchy and the intensity isn't there enough to be completely clear.  And PJ's sudden declaration in the desert supposed to be the explosion of his mounting change of attitude (you're also not that clear as to whether this is a tactic or what - could have been a clever part of the story but isn't clear enough to be certain) just isn't convincing enough and thus annoying.Still liked it on the whole though.",Holy Smoke!

My only question is the sound mastering. It is done in DD/DTS 4.0, which in this case means no center channel sound.

463025,"Ever since I read &quot;Hurlyburly&quot; about five years ago, I have been a fan of David Rabe. When I became aware that &quot;Streamers,&quot; possibly his best play, was made into a film, I wasted no time in renting it. I found the it to be true to the original script, with minor additions that do nothing to help or hinder the play's dramatic impact.  The plot concerns the interaction of six men in a desolate army barracks. It is only days (weeks?) before the men are to be shipped out to vietnam, where they will, most likely, die. This tentative, chilling circumstance is the impetus for the story's action. The central characters are Billy, a moralizing, confused college graduate, Roger, a street smart black man, Richie, who is an uninhibited homosexual and Carlyle, a lonely and paranoid psychopath. The diverse nature of these individuals makes symbiosis difficult, and their respective tensions and prejudices culminate in a nihilistic and violent explosion that metaphorically represents the conflict in vietnam, and the conflict inherent in mankind.  Streamers is an intelligent, claustrophobic and highly disturbing film that I emphatically reccommend to any who appreciate good cinema.",Streamers VHS
12451,"Alan Rudolph's Mortal Thoughts is a drama about murder, not movie murder where a hitmen shoots a guy dead with rock music on the soundtrack, but real-life murder, where the killer/killers have a crises of conscience, act  with shock, disbelief and paranoia.The film is set around two couples,  James (Bruce Willis) &amp; Joyce(Glenne Headly)and Cynthia(Demi Moore)  &amp; Arthur (John Pankow). The film starts out as a pitch black comedy,  with Bruce Willis giving an excellent performance as the loud, abusive and  downright nasty James. His wife Joyce played by the lovely Glenne Headly is  a neurotic who is constantly half kidding her best friend Cynthia about how  she would like to kill him. The whole movie is carefully framed with a  detective (Harvey Kietel) asking Cynthia questions about one or several  crimes. Slowly the flashbacks reveal the events as if they were happening  in real time, and the film's momentum builds to a point where it becomes an  unbearably tense drama.The murder or murders in Mortal Thoughts are  not commited by a movie-physcopath, but people who have lost their nerve.  Throught out the film they have to clean up after it, hide evidence and  virtually go insane in the proccess. It the documentary like portrayel of  the murders and the first rate acting that makes this film so much better  then the countless other murder mysteries you may have seen.The film  however does have one major flaw. After slowly revealing its cards with  tense intorrogation scenes the ending is a complete cop out. Without giving  anything away, I will say that after working so hard on revealing the facts  in the detective's questioning, the truth is unveiled by us seeing the  thoughts of one of the major characters. This is not only cheating, but it  also leaves a second major crime unresolved.Despite this, I highly  reccomend you see this film.

63766,"When I was in my mid-thirties, I read every book Anais Nin and Collette  wrote and enjoyed them immensely. They were sophisticated women who led  lives decidedly different and more daring than my careful existence, and  writers who told the world about their affairs. Today, their writing may  seem tame, (Colette wrote &quot;Gigi&quot;) but it was shocking a few years  ago. Nin's diaries are still pretty steamy.The film, based on Nin's  diaries, recalls the period when Anais (Anna eess') and her husband lived  in Paris and became acquainted with Henry Miller and his wife June. Henry  Miller may seem retro today, but there was a time when his steamy  &quot;Tropic of Cancer&quot; was 'Banned in Boston' (according to my mother  who had a copy hidden where my father wouldn't look). Miler was writing  &quot;The Tropic of Cancer&quot; when he knew Nin.I saw &quot;Henry  and June&quot; in the theater several years ago and bought the DVD. This is  a very well done film--and very beautiful--Paris in 1931. (I keep it  stashed with &quot;Sex, Lies, and Videotapes&quot; which is tame by  comparison.) I also wanted the film because Kevin Spacey is in it.Maria  de Mederios plays Nin to perfection. Richard Grant plays her husband who  seems willing to go along with anything that will improve her writing. Fred  Ward and Uma Thurman play Henry and June. Thurman's acting is better in  this movie than in &quot;Pulp Fiction.&quot; Spacey plays a writer who is  part of the writer's network, and has some funny scenes.The movie has a  lot of sex on screen. There is so much sex I found myself laughing after  awhile. The characters seem to live for the erotic. I say &quot;seem  to&quot; because it is never clear to me how much of their behavior is  driven by erotic desire and how much is driven by a desire to run back and  write it down in their diaries and books.  The story definitely contains a  'tongue-in-cheek' element.Nin revealed the story to the world after all  the characters were dead, so we'll never know how much was fact and how  much fiction.",N/A

179475,"Friend PricesFor all its reputation of hard-hitting action and  harder sexuality, ""Pulp Fiction"" contains some of the sweetest moments  between men and women that have ever been filmed.  In its own way, this is  one of the best of the Chick Flicks.  Not only does Travolta's  character not take advantage of a woman to whom he is deeply attracted,  when a terrible crisis arises, he stands by her. True, if he violates her  very formidable husband's trust, his only alternative is to cut and run and  hope her husband never finds him -- a lot of people are on the run from the  guy, anyway -- but Travolta's character hangs in there.  By the end of  their scenes together, Travolta's and Thurman's characters are best buds,  with the kinds of secrets that buddies keep.  Bruce Willis may rant and  rave at his own girlfriend -- the actress is obviously playing a woman who  grew up with a lot of abuse -- but he takes responsibility for his own  mistakes, and instead of blaming her, he actually apologizes to her.  He's  polite and pleasant with the bloodthirsty cab-driver.  Plenty of tension in  these relationships, but no harm.  When Thurman's character is alone  with her husband, she is obviously completely happy and at ease.  Her  husband and she never talk to one another -- but we receive the clue to  their relationship when she says,""Don't you hate those uncomfortable  silences?""  She wants a man she can be silently happy with.  Somebody she  can just sit and enjoy life with.  Maybe she is a trophy wife, maybe she  just wants her husband for his money.  Who knows?  It doesn't harm anyone.  They're both happy and comfortable and stable with each other.  Her husband  has trouble with other people, but not with her.  The pitiful little  robber couple in the restaurant obviously adore one another, and will stand  by each other, come hell or bad robberies.  Theirs is probably the sweetest  relationship in the movie.  And if we want to observe the Perfect  Couple, we have Travolta and Jackson.  They literally cannot live without  each other, at least not as long as they remain in their world.  Harvey  Keitel and his girlfriend are the picture of great pals.  Everybody should  go to breakfast like that.  When the characters do favors for each  other, they remember the favors, and reciprocate.  In a way they reflect  the natural gratitude of predators -- do something good for a predator, and  that animal will never forget.  Aesop got it right.  Nobody forgets who's  done right by him or her.  These are Friend Prices.  The only time the  Couple goes wrong is with Christopher Walken and his prison buddy.  They  hang together, but Walken's character is boiling over with resentment.  He's been handed a Fairy Tale that shines in the past, and tried to pass it  on.  But the closer you get to today, the more true and the more mean the  Fairy Tale always gets.  Could be it was because Walken and his buddy  didn't -- so to speak -- Watch Out.  The characters in ""Pulp Fiction""  are as good and honest and true as their lives allow them to be.  Hats off  to Tarantino for giving us these thoroughly sympathetic rats and runners.  We couldn't imagine ourselves, in the same situations, acting any other  way.  It's a lesson in How To Be Nice To Your Girlfriend -- or your Buddy  or Pal or Boyfriend, for that matter.",N/A
514754,"Summer of Sam is a film about the events of the last few New York summers of the seventies, and the bizzare killing spree of the .44 caliber killer. But while the portrayal of David Berkowitz is spectacular and, I immagine,  realistic, and while Spike Lee captured the intesity of these events, the  film is not really about the Son of Sam himself.In fact, this film is  probably closer to a film like The Last Days of Disco, than a work like  Silence of the Lambs. And while Son of Sam is the catalyst for much of the  film's action, the decadent freedom of the seventies is the real main  character.Spike Lee does an excelent job of paralleling the madness and  the frenzy of David Berkowitz with that of the disco age in NYC. The  complexity of a generation in the middle of a burnout is also well captured  with a fine attention to detail that is comparable to even that of the New  York kid, Martin Scorcesse, himself. The thing that really surprised me  about the direction was that it was done by Spike Lee. While I do think  Spike's &quot;Joints&quot; are masterful, they have a distinctly different  flavor to them.Overall, this is a powerfully well made film with an  amazing young cast and some of the best &quot;frenzy&quot; cinematography I  have seen in a long time. And while I can find some fault with some of the  finer points of the writing, I wholeheartedly reccoment this film. After  all, how often does the Who's &quot;We won't get fooled again&quot; appear  in a film from 40 Acres and a Mule Productions.Also, watch for Spike's  near perfect, somewhat self deprecating cameo and the one point in the film  where the audience is sudenly forced into the film's  world.MR_GFUNK@YAHOO.COM 3/3/00",N/A
553265,"Wax Mask has a lot to live up to. Not only is it a retelling of an already  classic horror story and film (House of Wax 1953), but it has the cold,  mechanical, blood drenched hands of two masters of Italian horror, Dario  Argento and Lucio Fulci, dipped in to it. Sergio Stivaletti, special  effects man on such films as Argento's Phenonena, Opera, Stendhal Syndrome,  and Demons (by Lamberto Bava), and Dellamorte/Dellamore (by Michele Soavi)  makes his feature debut as a director. Stivaletti doesn't showcase any  revelatory talent, just competent skill learned from his years of working  with great Italian horror directors. He has absorbed the style, but doesn't  add anything new to it.As far as the typical stumble in plot, occasional  flat acting (two things one accepts in Italian horror), a miscast lead  actor, and a horrible, but mercifully brief, finale, the film is average,  well paced, and thoroughly entertaining. It has modern touches in gore, CGI  effects, and some titllation, while maintaining classic horror elements  like looming shadows, mad doctor laboratories, and so on, making an  intriguing mix of old and new.The DVD looks quite good, a fine transfer  with sharp image and great color hues (Stivaletti saturates colors very  vividly throughout the film). The only extra is a short slide show of  behind the scenes photos. Fans of Italian horror should be well entertained  with this modestly priced disc. A C+. As far as this genre goes, you can  certainly find better, but most of all, you can find a whole lot worse.",N/A
93827,"One of the most disturbing thrillers ever made (forget Lambs this is truly frightening), Seven both shocks and challenges you, grips you then knocks you out, and leaves you cold with a little shortage of oxygen and a mild  headache.First the actors. Morgan Freeman showcases his patient acting  style here in a calm, knowledgable role while Brad Pitt turns up the  intensity and heat factor with hot-tempered hotshot role. Gwyneth Paltrow  does a fine job in her few minutes on screen as Pitt's wife. And the final  actor, (a well kept secret during most of the movie) Kevin Spacey, the  killer, does one of the greatest jobs for a villain I've ever witnessed. No  other actor could have got the sympathy he got with the disturbing,  offensive material he said to Freeman/Pitt, even if the sympathy was tiny,  just a little shred.As for the theme of the film I'm not quite sure  whether to think director Fincher was trying to make a horrifying homicide  thriller, a character study in the middle of a killing spree, or a  challenging, depressing, twisted message to the world (which has some  credibility when you hear Spacey explain it). If Fincher was putting in the  effort to do the latter, which is unlikely, I believe he might be quite  disturbed or even hacked off at the world. But I believe the prince of  acting's (Spacey) harrowing performance is partly the reason the movie  could get this impression/reaction.Overall this is one of the best  detective thrillers of the decade, maybe of alltime and is definitely worth  looking at, but its not for the squeamish or the deep-deep-thinkers (it  might influence..). P.S. the momentary glimpse of Gwyneth's face during the  film's final act (before Spacey/Pitt finishes the masterpiece..) gave me a  HUGE psychological shock, I couldn't sleep for a week...good work  Fincher!...",Seven

They did not do the movie justice.  And once you see the movie you'll understand why the trailer was lousy -- they couldn't really tell you much otherwise they would give the story away.  And no, it's not a movie about a bunch of guys fighting.From the first scene to the end I was hooked, especially after the first plot twist.  It was one of those &quot;what the...!&quot; moments.

420022,"Although I do not know anybody specifically like the people in this movie, I was impressed with how humanely the mentally-challenged were treated. The idea that they can (let alone have a right to)find romance is still problematic  in many sectors of society.Both Joon (Mary Stuart Mastersion)  and Sam (Johnny Depp) are slightly atypical, they are very talented people----in their own way. Their main problems stem from a society that does not  understand their artistic and free-spirited tendencies. Joon's patronizing doctor either wants to hospitalize her or put her into a group home. The housekeepers recommended by this psychiatrist did not work because they treated her as a task/object to perform, instead of an independent person.Benny (Aidian  Quinn) really tries to be a good brother, but he wants to protect Joon. He does not realize that she is much more capable of functioning than he  presumes her to be.  He has her best interests at heart, she is his  last family member and feels obligated to protect her. Coincidentally, he has a friend at the same mental hospital where Joon's doctor has admitting privileges, who says he does not want to be a housekeeper. Benny has grown up with the medical perspective of disability.Only later does he figure out that this approach is making him 'sick'. He has no life of his own and is always stressed. He also has no girlfriend to share things with..This behavior is not  atypical among parents and family with another member who has any kind of  disability. It is both inspiring and courageous for a major motion  picture to show a transformation of the characters from supporting medical to independent living that independent living perspectives.Sam and Joon end up the  perfect couple, and Benny starts to relax and finally also get a life of his own. Treating Joon as a person vs. a medical case is healthy for the entire family.The movie is charming. It capitalizes with the entertainment  world's fascination with the Pacific Northwest and the grunge scene of the early 1990's, showing a lot of great scenery and music Unlike so many movies today, the romance and intimacy scenes  are both romantic, obvious and tasteful.I did not intially appreciate how revolutionary it was to show a person with a disability having sexual activity.--but it does show this, as well as the all-to-real fall out when Benny discovers what Joon and Sam did, because he did not want to come to grips with her being an adult woman who would be interested in sexual relations.",Benny & Joon VHS

71536,"&quot;BEYOND THE MAT: UNRATED DIRECTOR'S EDITION&quot; DVD... what an awesome documentary!I was a big fan of wrestling many years ago and just  started watching again this year.  The game is more electrifying than ever  and things have changed since the 80's of WWF.  The focus on certain  wrestlers in this documentary was very fun and shocking to watch at the  same time.From Terry Funk getting the doctor's prognosis of his  battered body, Jake &quot;The Snake&quot; Roberts and the demons in his  life which was a shock to watch and most of all, the segment that really  hooked me in was Mick Foley's segment and how his family handled watching  him get beat during &quot;Royal Rumble&quot;.  Also, one of the reasons to  BUY this DVD is the comments Mick Foley had in the special features  commentary in which he comments about the Rock hitting him and boy, you can  tell Mick Foley was pissed at the Rock.  Also, you see a few features on a  few WWF and ECW stars in this documentary.Some people may want to call  this documentary perhaps &quot;The True Secrets behind wrestling&quot;.  I'm actually surprised to see the added footage of Vince McMahon...whoah!  A lot of things are in this video.  From people trying to get into the  business, the dangers of the business and the wrestler outside of the ring.As for the audio and video, the video has good colors, audio...I wasn't  expecting digital 5.1 to begin with.  As for the special features, it comes  with a trailer, production notes...not that much compared to other  movies/documentaries but if one thing truly shines in the special features  category, it's the commentaries on this DVD which are the big thing.  You  have to watch Mick Foley's commentary.  If anything, after I watched this  movie, you have more respect for Mick.  What a cool dude!So, wrestling  fans...this DVD is highly recommended.

426009,"I'd rate this film as Jet Li's best with second going to Tai Chi Master, Fong Sai Yuk 1&amp;2, and Bodyguard from Beijing. The transfer is really good which is to be expected. However, the dubbing isn't spectacular though  I found it just above the horrid dubbing done to Fong Sai Yuk 1/2. There  are some events that lost something in the translation such as when Jet  enters his kwoon for the first time again and sees his sihing(older kung fu  brother) being challenged. But still, for anyone viewing this for the first  time, it's a great picture with alot of more down to earth, bone breaking  martial arts than high flying wirework. Of course, people will compare this  to its predecessor, Bruce Lee's Chinese Connection. I think both are great  films, and they both stand on their own as their approach to the basic plot  is different. I'd recommend this film highly...if you can get the HK  version and don't mind reading subtitles(Let's face it, we don't really  watch HK martial arts films for great dialogue) I'd recommend that a bit  more than the dubbed US version.",Fist of Legend VHS
50632,"Alan Pakula, Robert Mulligan and Horton Foote have made an absolutely terrific movie of one of the greatest books in contemporary fiction.  The three years covered in the book are compressed into one year in the movie,  and almost everything of importance is kept in the film version.Shooting the movie in black and white was inspired.  It symbolizes the stark reality of black vs. white that is at the core of the novel. The acting is extraordinary across the board.  Of Gregory Peck, so much has been said that further praise is redundant; suffice to say that after Peck's performance, no one else will ever be able to play Atticus Finch.  The children are wonderful, so real that they hardly seem to be acting at all.  Mary Badham is absolutely perfect as Scout.  Phillip Alford is excellent as Jem, and John Megna is fine as Dill.  The lesser actors live up to the lead roles.  I especially liked Collin Wilcox as Mayella Ewell; James Anderson brings out all the ugliness and cowardice in Bob Ewell, and Alice Ghostley is a funny and wacky Stephanie Crawford.The three characters who didn't live up to their counterparts in the book were Miss Maudie, Calpurnia, and Tom Robinson.  Ms. Maudie is a very intriguing character in the novel, a ditzy, wise, funny woman of bedrock integrity; in the movie, she comes across as just another next door neighbor.  Calpurnia's part was far too small in the movie; in the book she plays a major role in the family, almost like a surrogate parent.  Estelle Evans is a fine actress and deserved a bigger role to give her talent more scope.  And Tom Robinson is almost too saintly to be believed in the film version, over-acted by Brock Peters.  But Robert Duvall in a non-speaking movie debut is just right as Boo Radley, and Scout's recognition of her formerly scary neighbor, with her tentative smile followed by 'Hey Boo', is one of the most affecting moments in the picture.I still remember when Peck won the Oscar for best actor; in his acceptance speech, his first words were 'Thank you, Harper  Lee.'  The movie 'To Kill A Mockingbird' is a labor of love of bringing a timeless classic to the screen, and Harper Lee must have been very gratified at the results.Judy Lind",N/A

You'll love it or you'll hate it, so rent this before you buy it. THis film is pure fantasy, it is a bunch of nonsense and ridiculous occurences strung together, if thats not your thing you won't like it. Munchausen is filled with wonderful and whimsical moments, along with stunning visuals. Air balloons made of underwear,a cast of characters with amazing powers and quirky attitudes, and strange beasts eating and killing everything in their paths. Gilliam unloaded tons of cash on the effects for this movie, and they look great considering it was made in the 80's. The dvd's image qualiity is wonderful and brings everything to vibrant life. THe sound was just fine for me and didn't drown out the actors dialogue. In order to truly view this movie you must be in the mindset that this is purely fantasy and no real logic is adheared to, even though there is a core story line.

499593,"ZULU DAWN is a superb companion film to the classic ZULU, particularly since both films were written by the same man, Cy Enfield.  ZULU DAWN climaxes with the Battle of Isandhlwana, which immediately preceded the Battle of Rorke's Drift, accurately portrayed in ZULU.  While the Battle of Isandhlana is important, the real significance of ZULU DAWN lies in its revelation of how the British governor of South Africa orchestrated the war against the Zulu.  Moreover, the British governor, Sir Henry Bartle-Frere, acted against the wishes of Queen Victoria and Parliament, resulting in the bloody defeat and near annihilation of the British 24th Regiment of Foot at Isandhlwana.  The arrogance and carelessness of the British is shocking and the humiliating defeat of the British army in South Africa strikes the viewer as completely justified. The fact that good copies of ZULU are hard to find is pitiful enough, but the unavailability of ZULU DAWN is a real tragedy.  It's extremely difficult to rent; it's been out of print so long that most recent video rental establishments have never been able to acquire it.

Nikki picks up wealthy business  men in bars, takes then back to their hotel room, then drugs them to sleep.  Al arrives, and the two are off with the booty. Only something goes wrong  this time, and the perp goes to sleep never to wake again. There stolen  treasure, and their demise, is a homemade chicken video featuring a famous  and wealthy ex-footballer (soccer player) named Zipper Doyle. Robbery is a  messy business, but blackmail would be much more clean and  profitable.Nikki and Al escape across the Australian outback pursued by  the police and Zipper. During their  travels,  the people they meet end up  dead. Not unusual for a road adventure, except that the viewer doesn't  witness the murders. Al is prone to violent outbursts, where Nikki is  shaken by the string of murders. Nikki's character is the more complex and  elusive. She witnessed a horrifying act as a child, and she also sleep  walks. Much like the relationship of a conventional couple, Nikki and Al  surmount mistrust, selfishness, greed and loathing; their trials are on the  road (surrounded by corpses), not at home. Their love is always  precariously balanced between bliss and self-destruction. And in the end,  their love is triumphant.Most interesting about Kiss Or Kill is the  supernatural aura of the outback. Only Nikki feels its magnetism.  Writer-director Bill Bennett is an excellent storyteller: revealing just  enough to satisfy the viewer's appetite, but always keeping some of the  storyline secret to hold the viewer's attention. He loves jump shoots. The  effect is unsettling, just as intended. He also shoots the lovers from  different angles. Back and forth between the two: profile, side, back. We  can't tell if they're siting or standing, moving or still. Very  disorienting. We've kept guessing as to exactly what the couple are doing.  So are the police, so is Zipper Doyle, and so are the other characters in  the film. Nikki and Al are on a trip with no destination. The only thing  that we are certain of (and proven wrong) is that they will not be  successful.",N/A

It is more like a modern melodrama with a heavy dose of religious subject matter, nice performances and some nice editing but unfortunately  not much more. The subject matter is sure to stir up some controversy but  that could easily be done be reading the basic ideas in a book, a film is  made to entertain and deliver something whether it's tears, laughs or  scares. While not a very bad film, 'Stigmata' just doesn't score in any  cinematic genre, it tries to swing violently between them but never scores.

Gabriel Byrne gives the best performance in the cast and  decided to play it mellow, which is a good thing and we never get weary of  his character. The main problem here is that explores subjects it couldn't  possibly tackle. Basically, it stirs up some intriguing and controversial  ideas but leaves you wanting. And also the filmmakers added some blood and  violence near the end so the audience would get their moneys worth but  ended up bringing the film down. It also has a heavy dose of 'The Exorcist'  on the 'scary scenes'. And also the ending is dull and unsatisfying. It  ultimately feels like a half-baked idea made into a movie. From a scale of  1-10 I give this film a 5!",Stigmata VHS
499518,"At first this movie seemed to drag a bit, but after the gangster cats came in I woke up.  They were great.  Snowbell, Stuart and the other animals were well-animated (or whatever) and Michael J.Fox was brilliant.  The parents were a little dumb but quite good, however I thought George Little was overally cutesy and unrealistic.  This film is quite good for kids, but maybe not for anyone else, though I guess it depends on the person.  Toy Story 2 is better, but this film could have been a lot worse.",Stuart Little
104691,"I had seen all the other Hammer Dracula films before finally seeing this one and I was not exactly sure what to expect, but I think it is a little better than I thought. The beginning is terrific and the ending is one of  the better demises for Dracula. The film looks very sharp, fine  photography. The film's strongest point is certainly Peter Cushing, his  performance is extremely well-done. Christopher Lee is once again used way  too little. The acting done by the group of young people ranges from  average to terrible like Scott Noame as Johnny Alucard, which is about as  clever as Ed Wood's villain Dr. Acula from Night of the Ghouls. Of course  their is too much funky music, late 20's hipsters acting like teen-agers  and cheesy humor. Still this is better that I thought and it certainly has  it's share of moments.",Dracula a.D. 1972 VHS
470092,"`Never Been Kissed' is a movie about a newspaper reporter Josie Geller (Drew Barrymore)  that has been given her first story, to go undercover as a high school student to find out what really happens to today's teens.  There is only one problem. She was a total nerd when she went to high  school. `Never Been Kissed is a hilarious, wacky movie that's shows that  you can always go back to high school.",Never Been Kissed VHS
319436,"Atkinson is again fabulous as the least (most?) likeable cynical misanthrope in history.  Wonderful flashback sequences sum up the past Black Adder incarnations perfectly.  The feudalistic-future scene is  blazingly funny! One thing to note: this is BLACK ADDER'S Christmas Carol,  not a Christmas Carol with Black Adder in it.  I'm sure Dickens understands  this perfectly well.",N/A
181371,"This film could have and should have been much better. It starts off like gangbusters! Two sisters arrive in a town that appears to be completely deserted. From there, the film takes a rocket-paced nosedive into sheer and  utter boredom. NOTHING HAPPENS, at least nothing worth reporting. The  talents of Ben Affleck and Peter O'Toole are wasted, and would have  benefited more from a script that actually gave their characters something  to do. There is, however, a monster that's worth your attention. If you  must watch, fast-forward to the end to catch a quick glimpse of it. Besides  that, you'll actually be a lot better off reading the book this mess was  based upon.",N/A
98606,"What could I say about this movie that hasn't already been said?  It's the best of its class.  It has everything; music, comedy, drama, sex, great characters, politics, terrific moments...  I could go on and on.  Liza Minnelli is the ultimate diva in this, playing the role of her life.  Joel Grey is absolutely perfect as the MC... his role is the hit of the movie -- for me -- despite that his only appearances are on the stage before an audience (I would have liked to have seen more of his character -- in a private setting, to see who he really was)...  In any case, the characters are all outrageously divine... even Michael York, who plays a mild-mannered language instructor (Liza's love interest in the movie).  Everytime I watch it (and I've watched it dozens of times so far), I walk away from it with the dialogue and music and images running through my head for some time to come.  And the music!...  If you love the music (as I do), you must buy the album.  Get the original soundtrack with Joel and Liza -- not the other versions.  It has the complete stage performances, including Joel's unforgettable &quot;Willkommen&quot; number.  This is one video that won't gather dust on your shelf.  If you watch it once, you'll be hooked... or I should say 'addicted'.",N/A
298118,"For years, THE HORN BLOWS AT MIDNIGHT was the butt of numerous jokes on Jack Benny's radio show.  Thanks to those jokes, the film has gained a terrible reputation in many circles. But in fact, while it doesn't rank as  a classic, HORN is a highly entertaining comedy fantasy that is virtually a  live action cartoon.  When radio musician Benny falls asleep on the job, he  dreams that he is an angel charged with blowing the trumpet that will  signal Earth's demise.  The well-meaning but naive angel is constantly  sidetracked from his task by various mortals and a pair of fallen angels.  The film is good natured silliness that in lesser hands could have been  dismal.  But Jack, Alexis Smith and their outstanding supporting cast  (including Guy Kibbee, Reginald Gardener, Mike Mazurki, and Margaret  Dumont) make the most of their opportunities and seem to be having a ball.  Franklin Pangborn is a standout as a prissy hotel detective.  Allan Joslyn  and John Alexander make a good team as the fallen angels; interestingly,  they had only a couple of years earlier costarred on Broadway in ARSENIC  AND OLD LACE.",The Horn Blows at Midnight VHS
131768,"What do you get when you cross a Merchant and Ivory Film with the typical hollywood serial killer flick?  You get the Talented Mr. Ripley.  The two  do not mix well.Filled with great actors and wonderful scenery the film  is too long and too talky.  I think they tried very hard to make a  &quot;sophisticated&quot; thriller and I they DID NOT pull it off  successfully.Interesting at times, the film is ultimately too long with  long streches of no real action.The DVD has some cool extra features but  in the end I do not recommend owning this one.  It is worth a rental if  nothing else is in, but certainly not worth buying and watching again.",N/A

Meg  Ryan needs to get more sleep and get rid of the undereye circles before she  can claim her cutsie status again.Not to mention, when is she going to grow  up and start doing adult movies with real characters instead of fluff  pieces.I felt like the time I spent watching this movie could have been  better spent clipping toenails for gods sake.",N/A
196359,"Here's one that'll give you goose-pimples kids.  I popped this one in the DVD tray and that's what I got for sure.  All the old-school Joes are here: Duke, Snake-Eyes, Roadblock, General Hawk, and the rest.  There's some new Joes too: Lt Falcon (as voiced by Don Johnson), Jinx, and Law &amp; Order.  The story revolves around Cobra and their pals from Cobrala trying to get their hands on an energy device under the protection of the Joes.  What follows is 90 minutes of those blue and red lasers and the resounding call of &quot;Yo Joe!&quot;  DVD is such a great medium for the Joes.  You can watch their adventures again and again with no worry of the tape giving out.  In fact, the animation is crisper than I remember it as a kid watching the Joes after school.  Let's hope that more of the episodes get released on DVD, you know there's a market for them!  In addition to the film, the DVD contains all the &quot;And knowing's half the battle!&quot; PSAs from the original run of the show.  Relive your youth and invite the neighbors over, GI Joe is here to stay!",N/A
513481,"I feel for those who had the unenviable job of marketing this movie. Who do you aim it at? Teens, most of whom know nothing about Nixon and Watergate, or adults, who will dismiss it as being another obnoxious, dumb  teen comedy? Hence the box office failure. But what true hidden gem this  film is! The writers have managed to put elements into this film that will  be able to please the entire spectrum of viewers and knowledge of the  Watergate scandal is not at all required to enjoy this hilarious film, but  if you happen to have a grasp on it's history, your enjoyment will increase  tenfold. The performances of everyone involved are top-notch with special  notice going to Dan Hedaya (Nixon dead-on)and Michelle Williams (watch her  shy expressions and mannerisms as she develops her crush on Nixon.  Priceless!). Many, many scenes left me laughing hysterically (the beach  dream scene, Haldeman's interrogation of the girls, Hello Dolly meets  Breshnev, Bernstein hovering over Woodward at the Post). Add great music,  costumes, sets and a fitting ending, and you've got a great movie  experience. Don't miss it!  (And for a treat watch this as a double bill  with ALL THE PRESIDENT'S MEN!). If you get the DVD you're in for more of a  treat with a hilarious blooper outtake reel (Nixon &amp; Kissinger praying  on the Oval Office floor (&quot;Do you want a hug?&quot;), a music-only  track, a director &amp; producer commentary track, making-of-featurette and  a deleted scene. This is a must-have!",Dick VHS
