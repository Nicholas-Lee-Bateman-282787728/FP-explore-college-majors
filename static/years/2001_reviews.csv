But when i saw it standing on the shelfs in the video store i had a feeling like i have to see it!! And i'm glad i saw it! It has not much to do with the original Blair Witch movie, but this one on it's self is a great movie! A very chilling movie and great music makes this movie for me one of the best i've seen this year. I think it's a very scary movie and the acting isn't that bad as most of the people say. If you like good horror movies this is definitly one to watch!!!",N/A

303353,"Lucille Ball and Desi Arnaz were brilliant together, but they deserved better than this film.  As Lucy says herself in her autobiography: &quot;Forever Darling&quot; has an underdeveloped plot and poor shooting.  Nothing really happens; the characters just breeze along from one irrelevant scene to the next.  However, the movie does have some pretty funny lines . . . in a mindless sort of way. If you need a good Lucy and Desi movie, let me suggest &quot;The Long, Long Trailer.&quot;",Forever Darling VHS

In one of Julia Roberts better roles, she acts straight from the heart, and her and Hugh Grant's chemistry surprisingly works quite well.  Although at times it seems a bit dreary, the feeling quickly disappears when you see the press conference, in a wonderful conclusion to a sweet and charming &quot;chick flick&quot;. All in all, this timeless tale is a heartwarming story of two people who make the perfect fit in an imperfect world.",Notting Hill VHS
261394,"Unlike so many sequels intended for family movies, this vehicle never talks down to the audience or has a too thin plot--if anything it is too thick.Fox not only must go forward in time to save his kids from a gang arrest, but must go back into 1955 to regain a book that had been lifted from him by long time nemisis Biff. If he does not retrive the Sports Almanac from Biff, his 1985 presence will also be threatened by Biff's &quot;good fortune&quot;.In an industry that has currently interpreted comedy as licence to make as many gross jokes as often as possible, the reunion of Fox and Lloyd reminds us that it is possible for people to be funny without resorting to crude humor.Fox is the usually likeable boy---and girl next door(he plays his daughter Marlene in the future segment)and even when his character does something really dumb or snaps at another character, the audience members cannot help but place themselves in his shoes.",Back to the Future 2 VHS
24215,"Perhaps Cleo, or, indeed, Corinne Marchand, is an existentialist, because she faces the prospect of a diagnosis of cancer with remarkable equanimity.  Initially it is unclear whether the diagnosis is to be made my a medical doctor or by a tarot reader.  In any case the potential illness prompts Corinne to indulge in recurrent journeys around Paris in automobiles, most notably a Citroen DS, and this provides for some marvellous footage.  She also regales us with some banal but amusing popular songs.  The minor characters, too, keep the laughs bubbling, not least the alleged love interest who is relentlessly earnest (could he be developing cancer too?) and irremediably short of stature.  Agnes Varga certainly knows her art, but it is doubtful whether she intended to dutifully explore the emotions inherent in the premiss of film.  This is a stylish and knowing entertainment, not some harrowing meditation on death and disease - enjoy with a bowl of bouillabaisse, a baguette, and a glass of semillion.",N/A

491173,"Eight traveling vacationers witness the sudden car-crash and slow final death of con-man Smiler Grogan in the hills above Palm Desert, Cal.. Grogan's dying words reveal the secret location of $350,000 hidden in Santa Rosita Park, near San Diego. This sparks a wild, hectic race for the dough. Pure greed,buried treasure, and car crashes. It's all here. &quot;It's a Mad,Mad,Mad, Mad World&quot; was the most successful movie directed by ace Stanley Kramer. All of the famous television and film comics from 1963 appear in this wild comedy. Only Bob Hope is missing. The cast includes Milton Berle, Sid Caesar, Phil Silvers, Jerry Lewis, Joe E. Brown, The Three Stooges, Buster Keaton, Jimmy Durante, Jack Benny, Jonathan Winters, and Spencer Tracy. Ernest Gold composed an original booming, wonderful soundtrack you'll be humming for days. At two hours and 41 minutes, &quot;Mad World&quot; is too long, but an incredible cast and mad-cap action propel the story along. This new MGM DVD is presented in widescreen anamorphic 2.35:1 aspect. The colors are crisp and vibrant. The &quot;Mad World&quot; DVD includes an excellent 1991 documentary with all the major surviving cast members. There's also 1 hour of &quot;out-takes&quot;, faded and damaged, from the original Cinerama 70mm release. And there's two trailers. The year 2001 produced an obvious remake of &quot;Mad World&quot; called &quot;Rat Race&quot;, a modest hit. Stanley Kramer and Spencer Tracy made 4 classic films together. The last was the inspiring &quot;Guess Who's Coming to Dinner&quot; in 1967. In ill health, sadly, Tracy died just days after shooting ended. Stanley Kramer himself died in Feb. 2001. His genius is now gone. His legacy lies before you.",N/A
481277,"Daughter of Dr. Jekyll is a competent if somewhat lacklustre little Saturday-afternoon time-waster for B-horror fans. Personally, I find little evidence of director Edgar G. Ulmer's celebrated genius on display here (sorry Ulmerophiles). The movie never really rises above it's poverty-stricken origins, yet rarely generates genuinely enjoyable Bad Film ambience either. Gloria Talbott (The Cyclops, I Married a Monster from Outer Space) is radiant as Janet Smith [Jekyll], genre icon John Agar is his usual tabula rasa self, and Arthur Shields is annoyingly Barry Fitzgerald-ish as 'kindly' Dr. Lomas. The script by no-budget producer Jack Pollexfen (Neanderthal Man, Indestructible Man, Monstrosity) is strictly pedestrian, a curious hodgepodge of the Jekyll/Hyde story and werewolf/vampire legends, incorporating such hoary devices as the secret passage behind the bookcase and the monster leering at the half-dressed cheesecake model. The embarrassingly corny &quot;are you sure?&quot; opener and closer is sure to cling to your brain like an exceptionally irritating TV commercial. The movie also suffers at times from lack of budget (exteriors of the 'mansion' are an all-too-obvious model), although it does boast some terrific-looking cobwebs and atmospheric fog scenes. Keep an eye out for the underutilized though potentially quite effective red/green filter technique employed, if less than stunningly, for the monster's climactic transformations (see Mamoulian's 1932 Jekyll &amp; Hyde, She Devil [1957], or Bava's Black Sunday for its much more effective application). Trivia note: Talbott apparently was co-featured with herself on a double-bill of this movie and The Cyclops back in 1957.Allday continues their tradition of giving first-class DVD treatment to neglected films with this release. The 1.85:1 letterboxed DVD is mastered from the original 35mm fine grain positive and looks excellent overall in terms of brightness, contrast, sharpness, grayscale, and shadow/highlight detail. There is some sporadic very light speckling and spotting, a few stretches with very minor vertical scratches, and some of the exteriors and fog scenes look a bit soft and grainy, but the source print is still far above average for a film of its type and age. Extras include an overall excellent-quality, lightly speckled trailer; isolated music and effects track; still and poster gallery; and on-camera monologues by John Agar (9 mins) and Arianne Ulmer Cipes (16 mins). Ms. Cipes discusses the preservation/legal issues involved with the movie and DVD release, recalls producer Jack Pollexfen, and compares today's indie filmmakers with Ulmer in his pioneering early years. Agar reminisces about his early John Ford films and Universal-era SF flicks, relating precious little about DoDJ; genre fans who read 'zines like Scarlet Street, Psychotronic Video, or Filmfax regularly will learn virtually nothing new in his segment. The movie is gets 3 stars, the DVD package rates 4 or 5.","Daughter of Dr. Jekyll: Edgar Ulmer Collection, Volume Three"
550334,"Bandai is one company that knows what it's doing. Instead of releasing two or three episods on one DVD, they go ahead and release 9 full episodes on a 2 DVD set, for almost half the price. Outlaw Star is the story of Gene Starwind, a gunslinging &quot;outlaw&quot; in a distant future where humanity has expanded life into all corners of the universe. He and Jim Hawking, his young sidekick, are out to just make it big when they run into a mysterious woman who says needs protection until she leaves the planet. Eager to be paid big bucks for such a simple assignment, Gene and Jim jump at the offer, but soon find out that the woman is &quot;Hot Ice&quot; Hilda, a rebel pirate who is running away from the Kai Pirates who are after her and the secret she hides. This secret turns out to be Melfina, a beautiful bioandroid Hilda had been stashing away in cryogenic sleep. Gene and Jim are caught up in more trouble than they can handle as they end up having to escape from their planet, Sentinel III, and head deep into space. These first 9 episodes of Outlaw Star are mainly just there to establish the characters, their personalities, and motivations, as well as the basis of the story... Although there are a few filler episodes here and there.These DVDs include two language tracks, Japanese and English, and optional English subtitles. Outlaw Star would be one of my favorite anime series for one reason alone: The great voice acting in the original Japanese track. Outlaw Star truly has some of the best acting in any anime series I have ever watched. Every character is brought to life by the excellent acting of the entire cast. Shigeru Shibuya's voice matches Gene's personality perfectly. There couldn't possibly be a better person to cast as Jim than Rika Matsumoto. Aisha is voiced perfectly by Yuko Miyamura, who is quite possibly the best part of the entire show. After listening only once to her portrayal of Aisha, you'll absolutely fall in love with her voice and how it GIVES her character an identity. Then there's Ayako Kawasumi as Melfina, who gives her character a gentle and innocent voice. The list could go on forever. There really isn't anything wrong with the English dub. It's well-casted, as Bandai dubs usually are, it's just that when compared side-by-side with the Japanese track, it suddenly seems very mediocre.The picture quality of these DVDs is crystal clear, sharp and just plain amazing. The menus are quite average. I never particularly liked Bandai's DVD menus. In my opinion, they're too loud and too flashy. You have to wait for a long animation to complete, and a loud clip of music each time you choose a different menu selection. The extras on these DVDs aren't anything special. You have an image gallery full of character sketches and a non-credit opening theme song. The character sketches are quite nice, but they only occupy about half the screen, with the other half belonging to the over-complicated menu. A full-screen gallery would've been a lot nicer addition.Despite a few small problems like limited extras and poor menus, the low cost, the fact that you get 9 whole episodes, and the quality of the show itself makes this is one to keep.",N/A
457139,"Ever After is an awesome movie about what might've happened with Cinderella (even though she's basically fiction).  Drew Barrymore is great as &quot;Cinderella&quot;, and Anjelica Huston superb as her wicked stepmother.  For Drama lovers, there's lot of dramatic intensity, plus romance.

205772,"There was a time when the movies were meant to be an escape from reality. Durning the 30's and 40's this was most definitely true. In the 30's we had the ""Great Depression"", so maybe older movie fans notice that movies always HAD to have a happy ending. People didn't want to see a sad, depressing movie. They wanted to be entertained. And, of course durning the 40's there was ""World War 2"". And, yet again, they're ALWAYS had to be a happy ending. It's because of this, that I take a star off and is the only fault of the movie. It all ends to ""perfectly"". Everyone is happy in the end and they all find love and they live happily ever after, how sweet! lol. Preston Sturges comedy in the beginning may make no sense to you, you'll have to wait untill the very last scene to figure out what the first scene was all about. Gerry Jeffers (Claudette Colbert) and Tom Jeffers (Joel McCrea) are a poor,I guess happy married couple. Whom will be thrown out of their appartment room unless they come some how pay their rent. Gerry (Colbert) thinks since things are going so hard for them in their marriage it's time to get a divorce. She feels it's better for the both of them to go their own way. When the room is being shown to tenants an elderly man makes his way up to Gerry's bedroom and sees that people are still living there! After Gerry gives him the story of her life. The man decides to help her by giving her rent money and some over, a lot over! When her husband finds out Tom (McCrea) he can't understand that a man would give her money without [anthing else]being involved in the picture. I was shocked to hear them use that word in this movie. I thought it would of been a bit too much for an audience in those days, of course that's child's play to what's being said in movies today. The next morning Tom finds out that Gerry is going to Palm Beach to get a divorce. This makes for a funny scene as Tom tries to stop her, it's pure slapstick. After she tries to con some men into buying her a ticket Joel meets the same man who gave his wife money and decides to give him money too! Just so he can go after his wife. Now, the whole idea of a woman going to Palm Beach to try and get a divorce so she can marry a rich man might remind some of a recent movie out now called ""Heartbreakers"". I'm sure this movie was seen as some sort of inspiration for their movie. Soon Gerry meets John D. Hackensacker the third( say that 3 times fast!) and he becomes very taken with her and she becomes very taken with his money. He's one of the richest men in the world (It's odd how she just happens to meet him isn't it. It goes back to that happy ending habit in those days). After she and Hackensacker (Rudy Vallee) send some time together she meets his sister Princess Centimillia (Mary Astor) who has one of the best characters in the movie. When Joel meets Gerry there, Gerry lies and says that Joel is not her husband but her brother, and tries to hook him up with the Princess! Now, a lot happens, and most of it is very funny, but, I don't want to spoil everything for everyone. Besides the sappy ending, ""The Palm Beach Story"" is a great movie that will make just about everyone laugh. It's a good choice to start off your collection of Sturges movies also.",Palm Beach Story VHS
361681,"John Waters is the true gross-out artist, perfecting the craft before those two obnoxious brats who created &quot;South Park&quot; learned their first dirty words. While in the past 20 years his films have not been as visually shocking as &quot;Pink Flamingos&quot; or his other early films, he's never lost his wonderfully twisted sense of humor.&quot;Serial Mom&quot; is, perhaps, his greatest achievement of his later works starting with &quot;Polyester&quot; and going from there. A brilliant twist on bland sitcom suburbia (Kathleen Turner fits the title role perfectly) mixed with biting commentary about the media hype surrounding trials (and especially since it came out shortly before the OJ Simpson trial).Waters' DVD commentary is always funny and insightful, especially herein.

Other than Callas's participation, it's  a beautiful piece of cinema, it's shot similarly to Oedipus Rex by Pasolini, so you wil enjoy it if you like Rex.

56867,"This movie is a classic and it will stand the test of time. This is the second &quot;teen coming of age&quot; installment from John Hues, and round 2 for Molly Ringwald and Anthony Michael Hall. The first installment, Sixteen Candles, was more of a sexual coming of age movie whereas The Breakfast Club is more of a coming of age for one's character and social awareness. Where they are &quot;teetering&quot; with; do they stay with the social allegiances of their perspective pack, or do they listen to that inner voice...the voice of reason, maturity and human compassion that's not bound to any &quot;click&quot;. I also like the choice of actors here; I think they all fit like pieces in a puzzle and make their characters totally believable. I am in the same age range as almost the entire cast and I was a senior in High school when this film came out. Allot of reviews seem to put this film within the Junior High crowd but I feel it's much more mature than that. The very message that it's trying to get across isn't understood in real life until we get close to 18 or so. The story is simple; 5 kids have to come into school on a Saturday for detention. At first they try to segregate themselves according to their school social standings. Inevitably they find out that they are more alike than they ever thought. The movie, in my eyes, is broken into 3 parts; the first part is pure character development. This is where you (the viewer) get to know each person they way they are supposed to be seen with their everyday face. At first, they act the way they think they should act, and stand up for what they always had, with out question or defiance. They stay true to their cause never steering away for a second. The second part of the film is where the movie itself develops. These 5 separate entities realize that they are variations of the same person. They have the same desires and anguishes. Their pressures and stresses are the same even though it's generated from very different sources.The jock (Emilio Estevez) has the pressure to be on top of his sport (wrestling). In return for this he gets attention from his dad, coaches and keeps his standing within his social group. This is his priority in life and he doesn't stray.The Princess (Molly Ringwald) has to conform and obey the rules of her social group in order to be accepted and keep her standing within the group. She keeps her eyes closed; mouth shut and goes along for the ride.The Metal Head/criminal (Judd Nelson) is an angry guy! He wears the physical and mental scars of growing up in an abusive house. He hates most people, like the ones Emilio and Molly play, because in his eyes, they have had a free ticket and earned nothing...things are handed to them because of their social and/or economical standings. On the other hand, he feels that he's on a whole other plain because his eyes have been beaten open and he was forced to grow up a little faster than he wanted too or was ready too. I feel that Judd Nelson's character is the most crucial to the movie. He is the key to this whole new self-awareness for everyone, including himself.The nerd (Anthony Michael Hall) is the quintessential geek. His every woken moment is spent learning. He hides behind his grades and in fact, he wants to be more accepted by the &quot;cooler&quot; groups. He also is a little &quot;cocky&quot; about his better grades and academically superiority to the other people in the room.The weirdo (Ally Sheedy) is a loner and an outcast. She doesn't have friends that we (the viewers) know of. Because her parents ignore her, She feels ugly and without a place in the world. She is starving for positive attention. I think her character was needed in this movie to balance off the cast. It would have left out a very critical part of teen angst!Richard Vernon (Paul Gleason) is the &quot;Villain&quot; of the movie. To the kids, he represents the out of touch older generation and the mean spirited, high testosterone adult. For Richard Vernon, these kids are the source of his anger and agony. He has lost touch with the younger generation for 1 reason, he got older...and the older you get, the harder it is to relate to youth. Youth recycles right before your eyes, but you keep getting older. His character is the key that releases these kids. He helps them to strip away the blindfolds and to take a fresh look at every thing and everyone (including themselves).This leads to the 3rd and final part of the movie. Where they cleanse themselves of all the pentad up anger and prejudices. When the kids realize that they all have the same goal, they were just taking different roads to reach it. I highly recommend The Breakfast Club and it should go down as one of the all time great teenage movie!",The Breakfast Club
247537,"&quot;Horse Feathers&quot; released in 1932, is the Marx Bros. fourth film, and the second consecutive one without the illustrious Margaret Dumont. Thelma Todd reprises her role as a suductive vamp, as she had played in &quot;Monkey Business&quot;. And all four Marx Bros. have a field day poking fun of higher education.In this film, Groucho plays Quincy Adams Wagstaff, newly elected president of Huxley College. The first indication we have that Groucho does not take the role seriously is when he lights a cigar, strictly against the rules of the college. He then breaks out in song, singing, &quot;Whatever it is, I'm Against it&quot;.Groucho's interests lie with football, rather than education itself. Hearing that two really good football players are regulars at a speakeasy, Groucho visits the establishment, hoping to sign them on before the rival college, Darwin, beats him to the punch.Chico and Harpo happen to be there as well. Chico plays Baravelli, an ice man who sells liqour on the side. Harpo plays Pinky, a dog catcher. Groucho asks them if they are regulars in the bar, and if they play football. They go along with Groucho, assenting to each question. That's all Groucho needs to hear. He immediately enrolls them in Huxley College so they can play on the team.Groucho also has another purpose. Zeppo, playing Groucho's son in this film, Frank, has been neglecting his studies by pursuing interest in the college widow, Connie Bailey, played by Thelma Todd. She is working for the rival college, Darwin, and is using Zeppo to get the football signals. Groucho is determined to break the two apart, not because she is using him, of course, but to obtain her affection for himself.There are many hilarious highlights to &quot;Horse Feather&quot;. One highlight is when Chico and Harpo attend a biology class, escorted by Groucho. &quot;Have they started sawing the woman in half yet?&quot; Groucho asks the teacher. Chico and Harpo leaves some fruit on the teachers desk before they take their seats, as though they were little children. Groucho soon takes over the class from the teacher, pointing to a chart with the human body. Harpo sneaks up and places a picture of a horse over the chart, and then a pin up calendar. After Groucho tells him he can't burn the candle at both ends, Harpro immediately produces, from his bottomless pocket, a candle that happens to be burnung at both ends. The scene ends with Chico and Harpo shooting peas at Groucho. Not wanting to be outdone, Groucho joins in, having his own pea shooter tucked away.Another highlight is when Groucho goes to Connie Bailey's room, attempting to persuade her to stop seeing his son. Before he knows it, he is sitting on her lap saying, &quot;I could sit here all day if you didn't get up.&quot; Zeppo enters, and Groucho takes the offense, angry to see his son in a disgraceful postion. Zeppo leaves, and Harpo re-enters with a block of ice. The ice is used merely as a pass, or excuse, to gain enterance, and is quickly tossed out the window. When he leaves, Chico appears with a block of ice.  They go back and forth, getting more ice so they may enter the room to &quot;show their affection&quot; to Connie, leaving Groucho with little time to make his own advances.  Groucho's reply to this is, &quot;This must be the main highway&quot;.The climax of the film is the football game, where the Marx Bros. perform more of their hilarous antics. Groucho, after realizing the two real football players he was intending to sign are playing for Darwin, plans for Chico and Harpo to kidnap them. But their scheme backfires, and it becomes Chico and Harpo who are the victims of kidnapping. The two must find a way to escape before the start of the football game. When they do, Harpo makes his grand enterance on the field riding a chariot, and throwing banana peels in front of players, who stumble over them. Even Groucho joins the team on the field.&quot;Horse Feathers&quot; follows a procession of what is considered the best and funniest of the Marx Bros. films. The material is still fresh and raw, unlike in later films. The Marx Bros. are allowed freedom to do as they please, without being constrained to remembering the correctness of their lines. Adlibs are frequent, which only seem to frustrate the director, producer and writers of the film. The audience, however, is delighted, and could care less. We are much happier to see the boys working off each other, rather than what the writers have written. And the finished product succeeds as a result.",Horse Feathers VHS
222584,"Wire-rimmed glasses and a slight stubble of beard isn't enough to make Robert Redford completely convincing as a bookish CIA researcher, though he gives a terrific &quot;movie star&quot; performance (partially the result of co screenwriter David Rayfiel being brought in to customize some of Redford's dialouge).Also, Director Sydney Pollack (&quot;Tootsie&quot;) doesn't seem to have the feel for suspense-thriller pulp (the way someone like Peckinpah had), so &quot;Three Days of the Condor&quot; is a little too monotone and flat at times to be a completely successful representative of the genre.No matter.&quot;Three Days of The Condor&quot; had all the timing in the world going for it.Released in 1975, just on the heels of Watergate and in the midst of the Church Committee hearings on CIA excesses, &quot;Condor&quot; became the only box office success of Paramount Pictures &quot;Conspiracy Trilogy&quot; (the others being &quot;The Conversation&quot; and Parallax View&quot;).It's also worth noting the cinematography (done by the great Owen Roizman) is spectacular...the rainy Manhattan streets never looked so beautifully moody....and the score by Dave Grusin avoids all the usual thriller movie stabs and sting.The transfer quality of the DVD is superb, but the special features are non existent (all that's included is the original theatrical trailer--hardly a &quot;special feature&quot; in today's DVD world).&quot;Three Days of the Condor&quot; remains essentially a stylish artifact of mid-70's paranoia, and viewed today, in light of recent events, contains some really bizarre echoes.",Three Days of the Condor VHS

16300,"Finding this movie anywhere was like searching for a needle in a haystack. I couldn't find it in any store and I really wanted to see it, so I took a drastic measure and ordered The Movie Channel from my cable company just because &quot;Apt Pupil&quot; was aired on it frequently.  A gifted high school student studying the holocaust from decades ago discovers what seems to be a Nazi war criminal and turns out to be just that. Ian McKellan really does look like that type of person, and his German accent is pretty convincing. The holocaust has always been an interesting thing to me; it was very sick and was outspoken everywhere, but engrossing. The entire idea of this movie is introduced smoothly. There are a few scenes of &quot;dreams&quot; where Todd(Brad Renfro) imagines being in the middle of it all. They are somewhat violent and very graphic and believable. It is the best work of Stephen King because it is an educational movie. The movie digs deep to modify the former Nazi, and it shows in several scenes, his cruelness to others that lets someone believe that he was who he was accused of being.  On the negative end, it doesn't really go that far into each subject when the holocaust is mentioned, but when it goes in-depth about a topic, it explains it very well. The only other complaint about this is that it seems difficult to believe that he could find the man that quick, although it shows him researching it. Overall, it is a very educational movie that isn't offensive much and the guy from &quot;Friends&quot; does all right and seemed serious.",N/A
559685,"I thought this movie ruled. Okay, maybe it strayed from the story a bit, by taking a nine-foot tall alien freak and turning him into Dean Stockwell, and by adding a very hot Sandra Dee, but they at least tried. This is the only instance of movie exploitation, I think, that wouldn't have cause H.P. Lovecraft to roll over in his grave. And maybe Wilbur's star-spawned twin brother was a little goofy, but I thought it had that kind of rubber-suit-monster Night Stalker charm. Overall, the movie had a kind of narcotic gloss that aided well in the suspension of disbelief. I recommend this movie highly---both to Lovecraft fans and to ordinary horror buffs. It's cool, and even if this movie did damage Sandra Dee's career, she was hot. After all, monsters, even the slimy ones from outer space, need love too. So come on, guys, have a heart.",N/A
334255,"Skylark makes a promise to the viewer and then fulfills it. Sarah is a mail-order bride from Maine and this is the sequel to ""Sarah, Plain and Tall."" In the first movie, Sarah and Jacob write letters, fall in love and then marry. They are now even more in love and are committed to making their way on the dusty Kansas prairie.Water is so essential to life and the scenes of the Maine coastline contrast with the dusty land in Kansas. Both the land and the sea can call your heart, but only one owns Jacob's soul. The land. It is where he lives and breathes free. His stubbornness is very apparent, yet it is only that he hopes for rain and believes his commitment to the land will be rewarded.As the drought hits, their friends and neighbors start to abandon their farms. Sarah keeps saying she won't leave, yet her heart is not with the land. Together they battle fires with wet ""feed"" sacks. I could smell the fire and feel the coarse sacks because we had to put out a fire once when I lived on a farm in Africa. It is fighting with nature and when you win there is nothing like it.This movie did remind me a bit of the movie: Out of Africa. It had the same quiet stillness and deep thoughtfulness. Glenn Close and Christopher Walken just have to look at one another for sparks to fly onscreen, yet the characters share a smoldering fire.The love between Jacob and Sarah smolders throughout the entire movie and is a tribute to marriage. Even though Sarah says: ""Sometimes what people choose to write down on paper is more important than what they say,"" there are some things that must be shared in person. Sarah leaves the best secret for last.If you have ever felt a love for the earth or inhaled the scent of a newly soaked field....or if you have ever stood in the rain... this is your movie! If you have never lived the country life, indulge your vision and poetic nature. Perhaps soon you will want to travel more or even move away from the city life.A completely enchanting, yet slow paced story focusing more on emotions and family ties. A story about love of family, love of the land and the chance people take when they marry for better or worse. The theme of families being able to stick together in life, is magical and very refreshing. There is something to be said for true love when it comes from a decision to love.The last scene is so poignant, I won't spoil it for you even thought I would love to tell you what Sarah does to solidify her commitment to her man and her country. This is a romantic movie, but is well suited for family viewing. Skylark is as refreshing to the soul as rain is to the parched earth.~The Rebecca Review",Skylark VHS
136718,"This is perhaps the most serious and socially redeeming film that Mel Gibson has done, it is up there with Braveheart on my list of favorite Gibson films would probably fall in the top 100 of my favorite all time films if I ever made such a list..  Real magic in acting is the performance given by Linda Hunt as she plays the part of a man most convincingly.  Her portrayal of an Indonesian insider is very good.  I am a big Gibson fan, and like almost all his films, but this movie is more than just a good movie well acted.Up until just recently this movie was banned in Indonesia and for good reason, well, at least  for good reason if you happen to be part of a corrupt government.  It shows the darker side of  revolution and reveals what most governments in backwards and corrupt parts of the world would like to remain hidden; their policies usually result in a huge class of very poor.Gibson plays a British reporter freshly arriving in Indonesia, he meets some other reporters doing the usual reporting but  he gets on an inside track that takes him into the seat of power and also into the country to meet the other side.  It really isn't a story about the setting and times so much as it is a story about the people, friendship, loyalty and the terrible realization that life isn't fair or kind to most of the earths inhabitants but that friendship and love between people are enduring.Even though the film is somewhat dark, I don't feel like it is a &quot;downer&quot; kind of movie, but it is definitely a &quot;thinking/feeling&quot; movie and not at all like the action/adventure/thriller type of movies that Gibson later becomes famous for.  I highly recommend this film.",N/A

120891,"Yes it's 1988 and Clint Eastwoods legendary Dirty Harry goes for sequal Number four. There could've been more. Magnum Force 1973 probably my favorite gave Harry a run for his sanity when others saw the scum of society the way he did, Only they decided to kill them. That's not legal. I think. Well this final episode goes back to the original plotline of Dirty Harry 1971 with a single wacko murderer. This time he's killing people listed on a dead pool a sick game which predicts what celeberities will die first. However the pool requires the person to die of natural causes or not be killed by the person who has the name on their list. So we can assume it's not the killers pool. Thus an intelligent plot with Jim Carrey as a stoned out rock artist singing ""Welcome to the Jungle"". Liam Neeson well plays a horror movie director and Patricia Clarkson an eventual love interest for Callahan as a tenacious and to inquiring TV news reporter. Excellent car chase scene as the killer creates a powerful toy car to chase his prey as an explosive attached to a detinator. The plotline with law officials against the killer may only be half alive today as the reigns have been handed down to Bruce Willis' Diehard flicks and Diehard 3 was back in 1995. I think The Dead Pool which is not as good as the original Dirty Harry or for that matter Magnum Force is about as good as The Enforcer 1976. Of course Clints aged a bit but it's much better than Sudden Impact 1982. A must see for Dirty Harry Fans!",N/A

226058,"I think that is the best tag-line for a movie ever! &quot;Alien&quot; is visually stunning, no doubt, and at times very scary. The plot is familiar, of course, but the characters make up for it. This movie made Sigourney Weaver a star, playing one of the great screen characters Ellen Ripley. My favorite character in this movie is Parker, who has the best lines. The pacing is slow, to be sure, but it helps build up the tension and get you to care about the characters and their situations. The sometimes slow pacing is the one thing I don't like about this movie. Not that I need action to keep my attention. I like suspense as well as action. I recommend this movie to sci-fi or Alien fans, if you don't mind the slow pacing that I mentioned. The sequel &quot;Aliens&quot; is even better and more fast-paced, and I'll tell you that I've been having dreams about it for weeks. By the way, I also want to tell you that the theatrical trailer for &quot;Alien&quot; from 1979 was scary, and my favorite scene in the movie is the baby-alien/stomach-bursting scene, which is a classic!",Alien VHS

Bruce Willis is an underestimated actor, even though he played in some pretty bad movies. Die Hard is THE perfect mix of INTENSE action, very funny jokes and one-liners and entertainment at its best. And there's even more; the acting is very good. This is one of the most entertaining films I've seen for sure, and it's the perfect one to watch when you don't want to think a lot and when your brain is tired and doesn't want to work. All I can say about this film is positive. It is long enough, there are no weak moments, and you're staying on the edge of your seat during the two big hours of fun that this film brings you. The story is conventional, but there are details that make this film more intelligent than the average action flick. And I was very surprised by how violent Die Hard was.

581348,"This neglected series, which I saw in its entirety on fansubs, might very well be the best TV series adventure drama for younger audiences produced in anime--but I'm not so familiar with anime aimed at younger audiences, so that's not something I say with total confidence.  There are still numerous flaws in the storytelling, especially in the middle episodes that were made after Director Hideaki Anno handed over production to his assitant Shinji Higuchi and the animation was farmed out to cheaper, overseas animation studios.  (I guess he came back for the final episodes, which are pure Anno indeed.)  On the whole, &quot;Nadia: The Secret of Blue Water&quot; is an age-appropriate series that doesn't fail to include compelling characters, a twisting, consistently interesting plot, and a grand finale that's logical and actually worthy of everything that came before it.  Anno didn't even manage to pull something like that in &quot;Evangelion,&quot; no matter what the greater strengths of that later show were.What's actually rather amazing in seeing this series is how many parallels the storyline and even the characters of Nadia, Captain Nemo, Electra, and the Neo-Atlantean organization were carried over into &quot;Evangelion.&quot;  Suffice to say that in the second tape, the middle episodes before the infamous &quot;Island&quot; sequence, and in the final five episodes--the echoes are undeniable.  (Biblical references abound, for example.)  Situations, lines, and themes turn out to be similar, and occasionally they even rival the brutality that &quot;Evangelion&quot; portrayed so vividly--though of course, this show was made for children and thus Anno had to pull his punches.  Reportedly, he was unhappy about this fact; I suppose &quot;Evangelion&quot; made up for that!  Even the infamous close-up montages of still objects that would be a hallmark of Anno's later work shows up from time to time in this show.The colors are bright and sharp, if a bit 80s-ish and slightly dated by today's anime standards.  The character design is also much more &quot;round&quot; and &quot;cartoonish,&quot; with the eerie exception of Nadia herself--a dead ringer for Shinji, if I ever saw one.  (Of course both &quot;Eva&quot; and &quot;Nadia&quot; shared the same character designer, so it's no surprise.)  Special note must be made about the delightfully Jules Vernes-ish mechanical devices--the Gratan, for example, or the intricately designed Nautilus, which has throwbacks to the spaceships in Anno's debut OAV, &quot;Gunbuster.&quot;  As a previous reviewer has noted, the influence of Miyazaki, especially &quot;Laputa: Castle in the Sky,&quot; is significant, though they're not specifically the flying machines that Miyazaki has a special affection for.  The alternate late 19th Century portrayed in this series is quite charming and intricate, in a Jules Verne-ish way again.What I liked about this show is that while the above-mentioned brutality and plot twists are definitely present, the strong sense of faith and vitality is never lost in the characters--especially in Jean, who never loses hope, even when the moody, introspective Nadia does.  Jean's optimism is believable, not contrived, and it is his devotion and energy that drives this show, even as many of the characters around him start to fall apart in remarkably similar ways that the &quot;Eva&quot; characters did.  I think this ultimately was the secret of this anime's true success in Japan and in the early US anime fan community, besides the humor and impressively detailed mechanical devices and plot twists.I look forward to completing this series on DVD, hopefully with the valuable, revealing, and necessary omake/extra bits released as well.",Nadia: The Secret of Blue Water - The Adventure Begins - Volume 1

299344,"This classic movie has aged very well -- even after 50 years it's still highly watchable and completely relevant.  Some of the dialogue -- such as the discussion about how difficult it would be to get all of Earth's heads of state together in the same room -- could be taken from today's headlines.  Also like today, the scientists find it easier to meet on common ground than the politicians!  (Watch out for the cigarette smoking, though --- even the doctors light up in the hospital hallways!  Oh well, that's really how it was back in the 50s.  At the same time, it's neat to see all those &quot;classic&quot; cars and other props.)This film goes to show that special effects (of which this movie has relatively few) are not necessary for effective science fiction.  With good actors performing an excellent script, it doesn't really matter that the robot is a man in a rubber costume or the flying saucer looks a bit fakey when it first comes down to earth.  You soon get so caught up in the story, that it's easy to suspend disbelief and let it be real.  (I'm very glad they didn't colorize this, because the B&amp;W lighting effects are a big part of the illusion.  Adding color would ruin it.)Precisely because the script doesn't go into much detail about how the spaceship works, it doesn't seem as dated as many other 1950s films.  The minimalist interior of the UFO simply suggests technology so far advanced,  that you can fill in explanations with your own imagination.  (Frankly, I like this approach much better than the constant technobabble in recent Star Trek episodes.)  Michael Rennie plays a highly intelligent alien who could be a forerunner of Spock (minus the pointed ears), and Sam Jaffe is just wonderful as the Einstein-like scientist whose unbridled curiousity and openess toward the unknown is a fine role model for us all.

340503,"When I first saw the title of this movie, I was intrigued. I wasn't looking for a movie about France, but any movie title with the word Provence has my attention. When I saw it was a TV comedy, I thought it might be a nice few hours escape. I also imagined it might have some Provence countryside and local flair.This movie starts out very slowly, so you have to be patient. In fact, I wasn't sure I had put in the right tape to start with, but soon I figured out what the movie was about. Peter (an advertising executive) and his wife who decide to quit their jobs in England and just run off to southern France. After buying a quaint farmhouse in Provence, they try to settle into the slow paced country life. This is a very laid back movie, and that is perhaps its charm.Food is also a theme in this movie. There are romantic restaurants and fun scenes of Peter going to the bakery to get a baguette for breakfast. There is a bit of drama with the bakery near the end of the movie.You will laugh out loud in some scenes as Peter is pulled along with a pig hunting for truffles. There is a ""truffle mystery theme"" running through the movie. The humor in this made-for-TV romantic comedy is dry English humor, which I quite enjoy. This is really more of a comedy, than a romance. Perhaps the romance is that a couple is trying to find their dream and they stick together through the good and the bad.What I loved was that Peter was a writer and he is always trying to finish his novel. His wife helps him on a writing assignment about Provence and that is when things turn more into a mystery.There is a good dose of the ""French language"" in this movie, but you always know what the actors are saying because Peter and his wife let you know. The cultural misunderstandings are very amusing, but trying in a way. Annie and Peter do attempt to fit in and learn as much French as they can.When they experience the good and the bad, it is then they appreciate France all the more. The ""mistral"" winds (strong winds) catch them off guard as they never imagined they would have to deal with a freezing cold environment. When the pipes freeze and they are expecting company, they end up starting a kitchen renovation, which takes forever to complete.To top it all off, people keep dropping in unexpectedly and expect to be entertained. While they enjoy the company of ""real friends,"" they do attempt to get rid of a summer guest only to have him make a choice they are not happy with. The situations these two characters get themselves into are quite funny. They also meet up with quite a few interesting characters, those being the local residents.I do wish they had shown more of the Provenal countryside and lifestyle, but it was entertaining. I have always thought it would be fun to live in France and be a writer. This movie was entertaining in that regard. I would also love to live in that house with a pool! What a life! If you enjoy English humor, which is very dry...you will love it! If you love Provence, France, this is a rare treat.~The Rebecca Review",N/A

484816,"There's a scene in HIGH FIDELITY that's so truthful and so real it's embarrassing to watch. Rob stands in front of Charlie's house in the pouring rain. She has just broken up with him. He screams at the top of his lungs &quot;Charlie, you f****** B****!!! Let's talk about it!!!&quot;. Oh boy. That is sad. You see, Rob Gordon (a thirty-something vinyl record store owner, played with equal parts charm and annoyance by John Cusack) is a failure when it comes to relationships. Every relationship he gets into falls apart. And he is constantly the victim... at least in his own mind. Rob is the type of guy who is never happy with a girl, never really wants them, until he can't have them anymore. When Charlie (played by Catherine Zeta-Jones) asks him out and they start a relationship together, Rob's thoughts aren't ever 'man, she's beautiful - I'm such a lucky guy'. His thoughts are 'man, she's beautiful - what the heck is she doing with me?' In it's examination of the thought process of the terminally pessimistic, HIGH FIDELITY is dead-on. I'd encourage any man who has ever felt truly screwed over by a woman to see this movie. You just might learn something. What Rob cannot get through his head is why so many women have dumped him. He has compiled a list of his top five breakups (he makes top 5 lists for EVERYTHING) and decides to see these women again in an attempt to find out why they dumped him - completely oblivious to the fact that sometimes it isn't the guy's fault and sometimes it just happens that way. It's a stream-of-consciousness movie, with Rob often breaking out of character to talk directly to the screen, and we follow him through a current breakup with Laura (played with great sensitivity by newcomer Iben Hjejle) and through his day-today misadventures at his record store. The other examination made in the film is that of obsessive music fans (you know, the ones who endlessly debate and fight over whether or not the real title of the record is &quot;THE Dark Side Of The Moon&quot; or just &quot;Dark Side Of The Moon - believe me, I work in a record store and this type of person really exists). But the object of this obsession doesn't really matter. It could be film, books, comics, television - it's just something these characters use to feel more elite then the casual fan. It's an ego-boost. The clerks at Rob's store are the outspoken, snobbish Barry (played with extreme energy and hilarity by the wonderful Jack Black) and the quietly opinionated Dick (played with shy charm by Todd Louiso) and the scene inside the store are easily the best in the film. One wishes the camera stayed in there more often. This film could have easily been another CLERKS and I for one would have been more then happy. But the film has other plans and other points to make and it handles itself with sincerity, wit, charm, and honesty. It is a great film, punctuated by some great cameos (by the likes of Bruce Springsteen, Tim Robbins, and Harold Ramis) and amazingly assured and utterly truthful writing. Director Stephen Frears handles the films gritty look with ease and Cusack's performance is top-notch. It's a film where you might not know what the record store guys are talking about (but you really wish you did) but everything else - all the painful relationship revelations - ring true.",High Fidelity VHS

They are both bought very easily. The cast is good but how much entertainment value is there in watching a father lose his daughter to drugs and then to prositution? We can see that for free on Jerry Springer. And we are supposed to care about people who are so absolutely stupid? This film, just like real life gives you no reason to care about people who choose to be morons. This film makes you wonder if the producers and writers themselves were high.

67967,"This film is so close to real life it's almost scary. The rush of emotions one feels when watching Lester Burnham (played to absolute perfection by Kevin Spacey) wander through his life like a suburban zombie is simply devastating. The film was directed by Sam Mendes is such a serene, crystal-clear and precise manner, I can't help but be reminded of the late, great Stanley Kubrick who had a way of making even the most disturbing ideas seem appealing with his use of slow rhythms, dramatic pauses and glaring white light. Annette Bening's Caroline is the perfect shrew, but that tough exterior merely masks her insecurities (witness her brilliant emotional breakdown alone in the den of horrible house she fails to sale. Slapping herself and screaming &quot;shut up you baby&quot; before slipping back into her role as the domineering control freak is fascinating!) The lucious Thora Birch also turns what could have been a one-note character (Janie) into a tour-de-force of of teen angst and isolation. When she finally succumbs to the charms of the quiet,curious and supremely secure boy next door Ricky Fitts (the superb and commanding Wes Bently) the kiss they share is the most tender and affectionate moment in the entire film. Ricky's speech about all the beauty in the world and the way it fills you up is also a classic. This film fills me up and satisfies on so many levels it's difficult to convey in a mere thousand words. I can only say that if you've ever found yourself in a rut, or felt emotionally paralyzed, &quot;American Beauty&quot; will hit close to home. This was a justified winner of the Oscar for best picture. This movie is simply about being human and saving yourself before it's too late.",Belleza Americana American Beauty  VHS
446114,"I am not sure whether an average movie viewer would like this film.  But, if you are into art, foreign, independent films, or if you are a film student, this is definitely something you cannot miss. Fallen Angel's strength lies in the character development.  It follows four main characters, all unique in their personalities and manners.  Like, other Wong Kar-Wai's (director) film, these characters' lives are intertwined eventhough they lead their own paths.  Outstanding performances come not only from the main characters but from supporting characters as well--look for amazing performances from the father, and the man who was forced to eat ice-cream.Cinematography, film direction as well as the music soundtrack also shine.  Wong Kar-Wai pays attention to details, imagery and symbolism. It's shot in a very artistic way--a sort of Hong Kong, nouveau graphic art style combined with somewhat weird soundtrack.

479313,"One of Terry Fisher's finest films as director, The Devil Rides Out also features one of Richard Matheson's best screenplays. Matheson has great material to work with  from author Dennis Wheatly. The writing is, like most of Matheson's work, crisp and powerful.Casting Christopher Lee against type (for a change)was a bright move. Lee makes the most out of his character and it's nice to see him be the good guy for once (although he does play bad sooo well). Charles Gray also gives a tremendous performance as the head of the Devil worshipping cult.Terry Fisher directed a lot of fine films during his career at Hammer but none equalled Devil. Although this wasn't his swan song, it could have been since everything is just about perfect. The production values are terrific. A pity that the special effects weren't as sophisticated then as they are now. Then again they would probably sacrifice everything else just for the effects (a problem with so many current supernatural films).The audio commentary is very informative and Lee is a delight throughout. He's full of interesting information about everything from the title sequence to the production design. A pity that Warner Brothers chose not to hire him for the audio commentary for The Mummy. Maybe they'll realize their mistake and hire him for Curse of Frankenstein and Horror of Dracula when they make them available (better get cracking guys Chris is getting up there a bit in age).The extras are up to the usual standard we've come to expect from Anchor and Bay--great! I've always loved their reproduction of the lobby cards that they've included in the packaging. It makes each DVD a unique collectible. A pity Warner won't license Curse of Frankenstein and Horror of Dracula (they really should--they have so many titles to reissue that I'm afraid these two will get lost in the shuffle). Anchor and Bay could do a terrific job with these two titles as they have with all the Hammer titles they've licensed.",N/A

Only 1 person can find out.. Jennifer Lopez!  She does this by entering his mind.The serial killer side of the movie is pretty uncreative and highly unmotivated. If you've ever read about or seen a movie about serial killers, you've seen it all before. You also get the idea that this guy is the guy all the other serial killers would make fun of and pick on, should all of the serial killers hang out together.  Too much time spent on why he is the way he is, which was lame and pointless.  Generic bleeding heart abused child story, where if it was true, 45% of us would be drowning and bleaching women like this guy is.Vince Vaughn's character actually says so much in the movie.  I think they probably cut out the one interesting part of the movie:  Why Vince Vaughn wasn't a  serial killer.Jennifer Lopez, as always, shouldn't really be acting in this movie.  The whole cyber-reality mind meld thing was pretty lame and unmotivated. Better examples of this can be found in older movies like Dreamscape and Brain Storm. Even Nightmare on Elm Street!Visual effects were OK, if you're into antiques, the color red, or Tool videos.

588784,"For a three hour movie, this movie had remarkably little content. Althought biographical, it only covered a few years of his life, not even his complete boxing career. There were many unnecessary scenes that had nothing to do with the rest of the movie. For example, there was about 20 minutes of Ali jogging (around two hours into the movie) in preparation for the famous &quot;Rumble in the Jungle&quot; fight. During these 15 -20 minutes, the only dialouge is some Africans chanting something which translated to (I think) &quot;fear Ali.&quot; This scene has no point, and I think it was just put there because they wanted to make the movie longer. There were many other examples, but that one was the worst.Also, the movie was poorly directed during the boxing scenes. I often found myself wondering who was punching who. The camera angles were often poor. Also, some characters just materialized without introduction. For example, (I don't want to give away  too much) but Ali's second wife just comes out of nowhere. The audience is never told that he even got a divorce, let alone that he remarried. This happened a couple of times in the movie.On the positive side, Will Smith did an excellent job, as did most of the cast. Smith captured the arrogance, and hypocritical idealogy of Ali very well. Also, that Smith was actually made to look like Muhammed Ali is a miracle of film making.Overall, an OK movie marred by trying to be more epic than it was, and poor direction.",Ali
227905,"Okay, so we hate sequels, right?  Uh uh....Director James Cameron's best idea was not to even make a true seuqel of 1979's &quot;Alien&quot; - though repairing Sigourney Weaver with the acid spewing, chestbursting, drool-challenged reptilian-insectoid and vaguely canine alien of the first film, and using the first story as a base, Cameron has created a sequel more original than films that don't purport to be sequels.  In the original film, Ellen Ripley is one of seven crewmembers of a spacegoing freighter owned by the mysterious (though apparently all-powerful &quot;company&quot;).  When the crew lands on a remote planet in response to what may be a distress call, they unknowingly pick up a bug that systematically picks off the crew before being dispatched by Ripley.In the opening minutes of the sequel, we find that Ripley's narrow survival has a bitter edge - escaping her freighter, she's found drifting in space for nearly 60 years.  Thawed out of &quot;coldsleep&quot;, her memories of the alien terror are fresh while she lacks any friends or family with which to lean against.  Though eager to tell her story, nobody believes a word about acid-spewing, chestbursting aliens, and Ripley is written off as a nutcase.  Bolstering the case for insanity is the fact that the mysterious planet from whence the alien came has long been settled without so much as a complaint.  Certainly, if Ripley's tale of woe and acid had had the slightest amount of truth, somebody would have heard something.  And then nobody hears anything from the colony.  Far from convinced, the compamny nevertheless sends out a survey team of US Marines at the disposal of the company's amoral corporate rep (Paul Reiser).  Gung-Ho at first, the Marines land on the dark and remote planet to find it overrun almsot entirely with aliens.  Firefights ensue, arrogance is destroyed and the marines find themselves cut-off and alone.  Ripley, once thought a nut, is now the only hope the surviving marines have of getting off the planet.Aliens excels because it doesn't really try to be a sequel to the first one - mostly because Cameron uses a completely different style.  Where the first film was slow and brooding, the first one takes the speed-is-life approach.  Cameron's aliens fly off the ceilings, jump from floors, almost ooze out of every crack and crevice.  These guys don't hide - they jump on cars, run into flame-throwers, beg for grenades.  Cameron goes for the adrenaline route, but there's a method to his madness - the camera stays smooth, and the action is choreographed so that we always know what's going on (assuming we can bear to look at the screen).  The aliens get a lot more screen-time, but Cameron skillfully sets the scene that reveals the aliens and keeps them shrouded at the same time, so we never think we're looking at guys in rubber suits (at least not guys we want to ever meet in a dark alley).  Though the pace takes a big dip midway through the film (that happens in every Cameron movie) it picks up again in time to head for a major climax (followed by another major climax) at the film's end, in which we get a final claimx, just so we can finish the film feeling jolted and bolted.Aliens is also a human story - the marines come off as amoral lifers, but they go down as heroes, even Bill Paxton as the ceaselessly pessimistic Hudson and Jeannette Goldstein as the fearsome Vazquez.  Between the awesome visual effects and the speed of the action, you'll need to see this widescreen - don't settle for the cropped and edited version they air on FX.",N/A

538527,"** 1/2 I can certainly understand why ""Spy Kids"" has been such an enormous hit with children.  What is childhood fantasy, after all, but an attempt by essentially powerless youngsters to bring a little order to their world, to show themselves and the adults around them that they too are good for something - even if it's only saving the world from the forces of evil before it's time to come in to face chores, homework and bedtime.  Of course, children merely mimic the fantasies adults themselves indulge in - utilizing the same set of conventions that serve as the template for virtually all action/adventure films that have featured heroes on the order of James Bond, Rambo, and Arnold Schwarzenegger in his various fictional guises.  In many ways, the films featuring those characters demonstrate that many of us have still not outgrown the simplistic view of the world that fuels our earliest fantasies.  By making the heroes of this film specifically children, ""Spy Kids"" fulfills that need children have to feel that they too can be an active part of a power-conferring fantasy rather than just the passive observers they usually end up being in a real world controlled by adult concepts and adult rules.Fair enough.  What I don't understand, though, is why adults seem to be so enamored of ""Spy Kids,"" which, for all its hullabaloo and hubbub, is really little more than a juvenile version of the same spy spoof nonsense that has been a staple of filmmaking since the 1960's (nicely resurrected by the ""Austin Powers"" films a few years back).  Antonio Banderas and Carla Gugino star as Gregorio and Ingrid Cortez, two dashing former spies who have traded in the exciting world of field espionage for less glamorous ""desk jobs"" in the spy organization so that they can raise their two children, Carmen and Juni, in a more normal, less hectic and less dangerous environment.  Carmen and Juni, unaware of their parents' past, look upon them as two hopelessly nerdy representatives of an ""uncool"" older generation.  When Gregorio and Ingrid decide, after nine years out of commission, to get back into the secret agent business, they discover that some of their espionage skills have become a little rusty and they are instantly caught and imprisoned by a mad children's show producer bent on creating a race of indestructible children robots.  When Carmen and Juni discover the truth of their parents' identities and predicament, the two youngsters set off on a mission to singlehandedly rescue them from a fate worse than death.One of the problems with ""Spy Kids"" is that it seems to mistake frenetic activity for humor and wit.  Through long stretches of the film, we are being hurtled through space in one imaginary vehicle after another as the children search desperately for their kidnapped parents.  There is, moreover, an awful lot of frantic running around by the various characters, but the result is, oddly, not excitement but rather tedium.  Because writer/director Robert Rodriguez has failed to provide any truly clever dialogue, he has been forced to rely far too heavily on the special effects to carry the day.  The result is that we are never particularly captivated by the antics either of the children or of the parents, who, I hasten to note, actually spend most of their time off screen.  When they are on screen, they often come across as arch, self conscious and cutesy, rather than smooth, suave and witty.  Alexa Vega and Daryl Sabara, as the two children, are unremarkable but relatively likable screen presences.  At least they are not as cloying as their parents.The art director, set decorator and production designer deserve mention for their superb work in creating a never-never land world caught somewhere between reality and fantasy, perfectly suitable for a film built on childhood imaginings.  It's too bad that the screenplay fails to consistently match that level of creativity.  Stand by for the inevitable sequel!",N/A

493278,"Suddenly, in the increasingly right-of-center autumn of 2001, this 1992 film seems timely all over again. In it, Tim Robbins plays a folk-singing uber-conservative Senatorial candidate (?!?!), running in Pennsylvania. The film follows his campaign's completely successful efforts to cajole, seduce, and flat-out dupe the media into slavishly following his every move. He gets ten times the coverage, as a &quot;media phenomenon,&quot; as he might have as a simple candidate. His followers love him as though he were a rock star.Sadly, we may never know whether writer/director/star Tim Robbins consulted the Psychic Friends Network to get the idea for his film. No, wait -- he's still alive. I'll have to ask him about it. Be that as it may, the fact is that two years after the film, in 1994, the Republicans steamrolled their way into Congress fueled by rhetoric that, as often as not, could have been direct quotes from this film... Some of the political issues raised are dated now, such as the savings and loans scandals and the contras. Nevertheless, the basic spirit of an arch-conservative remains the same today, and comes through very clearly. I was bothered by the total vacuousness of Bob's supporters (actually, &quot;disciples&quot; might be a better word), who generally seem to come from less monied, less educated families than the supporters of Bob's opponent. Bob's supporters love him because he's a self-made rich man and he's not ashamed of it... it's true, it is all too easy to dismiss money as unimportant when you have plenty of it. I think, in a nutshell, Bob Roberts' supporters in the film are people who think of America as a &quot;land of opportunity,&quot; not as a &quot;society.&quot; After all -- many of our ancestors DID originally come here to get rich, which they could never do in most other lands. What his supporters miss is the absolute emptiness behind Bob Roberts' smile, and his arctic, ruthless willingness to do anything to get ahead and stay there. His supporters value hard work and success, which is fine, but they don't see that their idol values these things only insofar as they further his own insane dreams of glory.Today, some of the humorous touches may seem a little obscure for younger audiences. For example -- when BR was made, in 1992, cell phones were much more unusual than today. The fact that Bob's staffers constantly monitor media and stock market information on cell phones is intended to satirize yuppy consultants of the time. Today, it would strike no one as odd that staffers do this. Also, a lot of the music videos for the conservative folk songs are spoofs of particular music videos from the late 80s and early 90s. Another comedic touch that younger audiences might miss, for different reasons, is the way Merilee Dale portrays Bob's wife Polly.  A pinker, more precious, perfect, beaming Republican daddy's girl one could never imagine. Watching this film, I imagined frequent catfights breaking out on the set between Dale and Susan Sarandon, Tim Robbins' real-life partner and co-star in the film, who is an extremely vocal and opinionated &quot;feminist's feminist.&quot;This movie is a lot of fun, and it makes you think about things we should all worry about more. The only reason I'm not giving it five stars is that it felt a little thin for some reason -- maybe it could have used one more subplot. Still absolutely worth owning, however, and seeing again and again. Two thumbs up.",Bob Roberts VHS
531701,"Meet the Parents and There's Something About Mary were stupid movies because they were funny.  Zoolander is just stupid and perhaps the worst Ben Stiller movie ever.Stiller stars at Derek Zoolander, vaucous male model who is recruited by fashion industry thugs to kill the prime minter of Malaysia, because he plans to end child labor.  Helping him in this effort is an equally vapid model, Hansel (Owen Wilson who usually gets much better roles than this) and Matilda, a crusading reporter (Stiller's wife Christine Taylor who will make you yearn for her Brady Bunch movie roles).  Of the supporting players,  Jerry Stiller is absolutley horrible, badly acting as the owner of a modleing agency.  Stiller's mom Ann Meara is even in this, throwing an egg at a fashion desinger.  If only we had the same opportunity.The story really isan't about anything, it is a collection of jokes and bits that are mostly unfunny.  One scene in Hansel's pad, is excrutiatingly long.  There are cameos galore. David Bowie, Gwen Stefani, Fabio, and other Hollywood luminaries, here as window dressing or perhaps to pick up that much needed check.  Hope they were paid scale.Reviewers have compared this movie to Austin Powers.  I would too. Austin Powers 2 that is.  It is as equally unfunny as this mess.

Simply a deranged psychopath (well played by a very intimidating Snider).I can't praise this film as much as some others have, but the reviewer who hated this film really missed the point, and probably dislikes most all films of this genre. Virtually no one is killed in this film, any nudity shown is in a cursory manner, not for exploitation.

I agree with the previous reviews in that this was the best season of the X-Files, prior to it being all consumed with the &quot;mythology&quot; episodes and sheer stupdity at times. On average, season 3 had a good balance between these types of episodes and the one-off 'monster of the week' episodes (which are much more fun if you ask me). By the time this season was playing here in Australia, The X Files had reached the mega-hype level, and deservedly so. It is a shame that the X-Files has almost become a mockery of the great show that this set clearly proves it once was.

The movie's setup of these relationships between different characters is well-done, keeping its focus on the children's actions and their feelings on the situations they are put into.As most ex-wives will do, Jackie is condescending of Isabel, looking down on her as a self-centered woman who cares more for her work and personal life than for the children under her care. They have many sparring sessions and heated arguments, but it's clear that they cannot argue forever, and as the children begin to warm to Isabel, so does the friendship between Jackie and Isabel begin to form. Soon, they are helping each other through tough times, trading tips on caring for the children, but still maintaining that small spark of conflict which will surface time and again as Jackie realizes her children are no longer solely under her influence.The movie deals with a lot of real-to-life family issues that will hit home with most viewers and is sure to strike an emotional chord in audiences everywhere. One of those issues is the fact that a divorce is more about how to deal with the children than about getting on with life. The movie does not take away the focus from the childrens' feelings towards their situation. At one point, Anna stands up and shouts, &quot;You didn't ask me if I wanted a new mother!&quot; The story is still about the feud between Jackie and Isabel, but this feud centers around what each of them feels is best for the children, keeping with the fact that in a divorce, they are the ones who are most affected.Actors Jena Malone and Liam Aiken, Anna and Ben, do a terrific job in bringing out all of that emotion and feeling in their characters. Aiken's character is not required to be as emotional as Malone's: he is only eight years old in the movie, and does not clearly understand what his parents are going through. He is merely along for the ride, going with what his parents say and what his sister wants, and Aiken brings all of that childhood innocence out perfectly and with believability. Malone must provide a much more involved role: her character is older, and lashes out against her father for leaving his mother and preparing to be with a woman half his age. Malone is full of tears, anger, and laughs, and her performance is heartwrenching and convincing.Another issue is embedded in the relationship between Jackie and Isabel. Jackie has the maternal instinct where Isabel is trying her best, and the story is intensified emotionally by the clashes in how they feel the children should be raised. When Jackie realizes that Isabel is going to be a permanent part of her children's lives, she also comes to the realization that she cannot keep arguing with her about how to raise the children. As they come to an understanding of one another, it's intriguing to watch the two actresses interact onscreen.Susan Sarandon is plays Jackie, who is stubborn and becomes quite disturbed when Isabel steps onto her turf. She brings out all this emotion and feeling, as well as her actions and reactions, convincingly, matching the performance of Roberts, her opposite. Roberts is Isabel, and she brings all the brightness and charm of her own person into the role while also maintaining a short emotional fuse. It is easy to see that the two actresses are having fun in their roles, and their pairing for this movie is outstanding. Their performances make this one of the best movies of the year. Ed Harris plays the part of Luke, who knows how Jackie feels but wishes that she and Isabel would be able to come to an understanding of one another. His performance is earnest and warming, and like his costars, he makes his role believable and interesting.&quot;Stepmom&quot; is one of those feel-good movies that was able to keep my interest throughout. There is a twist in the plot that I dare not even mention, because the filmmakers and producers have done a pretty good job of not giving it away in the promotional material. There is a lot of love between the characters, brought out by the stellar cast and a director whose films in this field have excelled. Based on emotional depth and connectivity, &quot;Stepmom&quot; is a nice piece of heart that is filled with true human feeling.",Stepmom VHS
559441,"Overall, this movie left me disappointed. The acting left something to be desired (to put it lightly), it didn't really have a plot, and it was unsatisfying in general. There's a slight love storyline between two of the characters, but it's underdeveloped, and was probably just added to give the movie more mass appeal. The highlight of the movie by far was John Digweed's cameo, in a scene where he has a conversation with an aspiring DJ after performing a set. Sure, it gave some insight into the whole rave-underground world, and the whole party set is really cool (they have a chill room, a dance floor, a living room, a fruit and water stand, a massage room... they have an entire warehouse to work with!). &quot;Groove&quot; is worth a try, and can be entertaining at points - but if you're looking to  experience a rave vicariously by watching this, that's not the way to do it--  just GO to one.

Although the two main actors in this film are hardly unknown (this must be their debut film), they are very good actors.

Such as her friend/protecter Lava who wears a really cool mask that reminds me a little bit of the Phantom of the Opera. She also has a psychotic little bunny thing with a really creepy looking right eye. The DVD has three episodes on it the first being ...THE FANG KNOWS..In this episode Miyu must find out who or what is murding people had the school she has just enrolled in....episode 2 AT THE NEXT STATION...advances the plot a bit as Miyu makes friends and must dicover who is kidnapping beautiful women riding the subway...THE FOREST CALLS...Miyu's guardian Lava steps up and must deal with a magical mask which controls the one who wears it...All in all VPM is a great series and I cannot wait for the next dvd in the series. I will post my review of that one as soon as it is released. Enjoy!,Vampire Princess Miyu: Initiation
447848,"This movie is one of my favorites. Yes, it's little known, and yes, the DVD does nothing to improve the sound or image, but this is a great movie. Inevitably, this movie will be compared to Saving Private Ryan. Suprisingly, it holds up extremely favorably. The story, the plot of this movie is much much better. In this movie, death stalks soldiers all of the time, and you die a slow, agonizing, bloody death. Gone are the Saving Private Ryan's cliches (Such as the wimpy medic, the New Yorker, the Heroic Captain, the Jew, and so forth) and it's patriotism. This is war, war in it's most brutal tone. Sergeant Steiner, played by James Coburn, is a tough but disallusioned Sergeant who despises officers and simply wants to keep his men alive. His squad mates are instantly loveable, and they actually have real character. They are not flat cliches, these are real men. There is no way to call this movie a salute to Nazism or anything like that, in fact, it is extremely anti-nazi. The men in the squad are not thinking about Nazism or their great leader, they're trying to keep themselves and their friends alive, as was the actual case. In fact, the SS Special Squad reinforcement that the squad gets is eventually offered to the Russian women to kill. Since you grow so close to the characters, you really get emotional when you see them blown away in Peckinpah's typical balletic slow motion violence. The villan, Captain Stransky, is played brilliantly by Maximillian Schell. Although the slow motion violence is less realistic than Saving Private Ryan, it never the less evokes more emotions. This is one of the best movies about WWII and war in general, and is a must see even for people who think falsely that every German soldier was a horrible Nazi.",Cross of Iron VHS

540594,"JP3 is nothing more than an action filled, edge of your seat, nail biting, heart pounding, jump out of your seat action thriller with `oh my god, do those Dinos look real' special effects.  With that said, why wouldn't anyone want to see this movie?  I can't think of one reason.  This movie was great.  It was such an improvement over the second one that I am now hoping they make a fourth one, and let Joe Johnston direct it, PLEASE!  I know that Spielberg was happy with what he saw. Which tells me one thing, Spielberg has outgrown these movies.  He's moved on to bigger things, like A.I. and Saving Private Ryan.  So let the reigns of his more meager works be taken over by lesser known talented directors.  Johnston does a superb job of handling the legacy of Jurassic Park.  He takes it back to the roots.  The movie is more of an action adventure.  It does tend to touch more on the themes of messing with nature and whether it is right or wrong as they did in the first one, but not as much.  Alan Grant, played very well again by Sam Neil, is hired to play aerial tour guide for a rich couple who want to see Isla Sorna from a plane.  A crash ensues and of course, people become snacks for the Dinos.  There are some cheesier themes of family togetherness as Grant finds out that his rich thrill seekers are really poor saps looking for their lost son on the island.  But the action that ensues from this is entertaining and pulse pounding.  There are many more types of dinosaurs to be seen, and the new big baddie, the Spinasauras is absolutely nasty.  the fight between him and the T-Rex is worth the cost of admission alone.  Improvements in Computer animation since the first movie allow us to see spectacular aerial shots of so many Dinos that you want to believe there is an Island out there with these creatures to be seen.  As I said beore, don't look for heavy themes of whether we should be tampering with nature as they did in the first movie, but you can count on something much more thrilling and fun to watch then the second movie.  Highly recommended.",Jurassic Park III VHS

459188,"With so many reviews given before me, I will then go straight to the point about this movie.For me, I admit that I am bias when movies are concern, bias in a sense that, no matter if the movie is from USA, China, Japan or Russia, aside from good script, good story line ,good characterization and free of unwanted prejudices and bashings, it must have GREAT CINEMATOGRAPHY! And to me,at least, Dances with the Wolves can be consider a buffet. Pick of your choice, its all there and eat all you can. It is this sumptuous.Another thing, me personally at least, as an Asian viewer, who not only love and live along with different ethnicities, horse herders, nomads , farmers and aborigines along with modern cities and ancient villages, the main interesting point in watching Dances with the wolve is like watching a beautiful live documentary about the history of various Indian tribes and the Western Frontier period drama. Historical figures. Also,it is like putting me with its various people on the other side of the planet in the historical past.Then , this movie to me , is very special in that sense.I realized that the story of the movie may be fictatious, but the scenery and panoramas of the great frontier, the prairie , the buffalo hunts are visually stunning and the lifestyle and the costume of the Indians are amazingly beautiful, complicated and yet very very human,I dont know how accurate this movie is in term of  costumes and language and all, perhaps my American counterparts can tell me. But knowing Spielberg, the highly acclaimed director and his reputation, I can safely said I believe the authenticities he put into his movies.Some of my most favourite scenes are vista and the surrounding, so peaceful and quiet, when Kevin Costner in that long bouts of silent comtemplation, the Indians on the horizon line on horses, the stray lonely wolf that followed the lone soldier everywhere and the frustration and barrier of communication as well as the exchanging of gifts are inspiring, comical as well as touching.Genghiz Tanghe",N/A
698796,"Certainly this years' best, &quot;Amelie&quot; delivers what you expect from the word &quot;cinema.&quot;  Anyone who thinks life is worth living would agree with me.The greatest achievement &quot;Amelie&quot; displays during its non-stop 2 hours joyful ride through Paris is, ultimately, celebration of life.  What is more important is, it tells also dark side of life.  &quot;Amelie&quot; is sweet, indeed, but it is the film's subtle way of implying that life is not actually all made of sugar; (look how Amelie comes to be detached from her own father).  Not forgetting that fact, the film firmly convinces us that life is sweet.  In that respect, &quot;Amelie&quot; shares its viewpoint with &quot;Life Is Beautiful.&quot;Unlike the latter film, which is also a great masterpiece, &quot;Amelie&quot; reaches something very unique.  The narrative skills are full of amazing items; you can see &quot;a suicidal goldfish,&quot; &quot;a falling tourist,&quot; and &quot;a travelling gnome&quot; that really goes to NYC and Moscow!  Or picture yourself with Amelie how many couples are experiencing orgasm right now ... the film literally &quot;picture&quot; the answer (15) !!Besides these amusing scenes, you will be fascinated with colorful characters (one of them is Dominique Pinon as a very nervous guy with a handy recorder, who previously appeared in Jeunet's third sequel of &quot;Alien&quot; series in a wheelchair).  However, it is cute Audrey Tautau who steals every scene in the film.  It is now an incredible fact, but the director was first thinking of Emily Watson as a leading lady (hence Amelie, got it?) but, though I love Emily Watson, the result turned out probably better with Tautou.Finally, &quot;Amelie&quot; proves what a good cinema can do.  It is funny, it is lovely, but most of all, it celebrates life.  And that makes the film a must for everyone living at this age full of troubles.And, really, finally.

So what does the ''greatest generations'' youth do to honor them? Make a horrible movie like this. Pearl Harbor is one of the most overhyped, and overplayed movies ever. Instead of having the great and powerful war plot in Saving Private Ryan, Pearl Harbor was more like Armageddon. It was all about the action. Maybe 1/3 of the movie was focused on the characters. But all they focused on were the two best buds and their love interest. At first it seemed okay, but the rivalry and the acting got old very quick. Ben Affleck is one of my favorites, but I dont know what got in his mind to make a movie like this. It tried way too hard to have everything for everybody (romance, action, humor).

And Osment's performance as the disturbed child Cole who has &quot;the sixth sense&quot; is astonishing--in my opinion, it's the best performance by a child actor in film since Patty Duke in &quot;The Miracle Worker&quot;. The wonderful relationship that evolves between Malcolm and Cole is worth the price of admission alone. Also kudos to Toni Collette as Cole's ever-loving, always supportive Mom; to Olivia Williams as Malcolm's wife (in hindsight, one realizes that Williams pulls off an incredibly difficult technical piece of acting), and Donnie Wahlberg as Vincent, the anguished, tortured young man whom Malcolm could not save.

237126,"During the Christmas season of 1978, my uncle and aunt took me to a movie theater to see a double-bill of two holiday-based horror films: John Carpenter's &quot;Halloween&quot; and Bob Clark's &quot;Black Christmas.&quot;  We absolutely loved &quot;Halloween,&quot; but found &quot;Black Christmas&quot; to be so dull that we walked out in the middle of the picture.  Twenty-two years later, I reviewed the WHOLE movie on video and now have a different impression of this film.During the Christmas season, sorority girl Olivia Hussey is pregnant and wants to have an abortion but her boyfriend Keir Dullea doesn't want her to have the procedure.  Meanwhile, Hussey and her sorority sisters(Including a pre-&quot;Superman&quot; Margot Kidder) are also receiving obscene phone calls from a cackling pervert.  The obscene phone caller later sneaks into the attic of the sorority house and starts killing the girls one by one.&quot;Black Christmas&quot; has some major weak points.  The film is slow-moving and monotonous at times.  The movie also lacks the thrills and suspense of Carpenter's &quot;Halloween.&quot;  John Saxon is given a thankless role as a police detective.Nevertheless, every horror fan should sit through all of &quot;Black Christmas&quot; at least once.  Kidder is great as Barb, a drunken and foul-mouthed sorority sister.  We also develop a great concern for the characters in this film.  If anything, Bob Clark's film definitely succeeds in one area where John Carpenter largely failed in &quot;Halloween&quot;: Realism.  The forever unidentified villain of &quot;Black Christmas&quot; is much more frightening than the Michael Myers character of &quot;Halloween.&quot;  The Michael Myers character is so superhuman that viewers know they would never actually encounter such a character in real life.  The hysterically shrieking and giggling obscene phone caller in &quot;Black Christmas,&quot; however, is VERY real.  Such psychotics and perverts exist in the real world.  In this respect, &quot;Black Christmas&quot; is far creepier than &quot;Halloween.&quot;  Today, in an era of DNA-based criminal evidence as well as Caller ID and other efficient phone number-tracing systems, this movie is probably not quite as scary, but definitely SHOULD HAVE sent a chill up the spine of any 1970s-viewer who received an obscene phone call at some point in their lives.Despite its weaknesses, every horror fan should see &quot;Black Christmas&quot; in its entirety at least once.  This film is a lost horror classic.  Well-recommended.",N/A
255048,"From just about anyone's standpoint, this is not a good film.  But the problem isn't the directing.  William Shatner clearly knows how to handle a camera and draws fine performances from the cast (especially DeForest Kelley).The problem with Star Trek V centers on the script.  There is an old Broadway saying, &quot;If it ain't on the page, it ain't on the stage.&quot;  The failure of this movie proves the validity of that truism.  Since Shatner is listed as one of the persons behind the story here, he must bear his fair share of the responsibility for the problems with this story.  Creating a script about the search for a tangible God, even if it winds up  being a false God, sets the viewer up for disappointment.  No matter how spectacularly the Almighty is presented on film, it can't live up to the real thing.  In this film, He comes across as a latter day Wizard of Oz.  Compounded with that are the problems with continuity within the Trek &quot;universe,&quot; and overall tone: introducing Sybok as Spock's half-brother, and the use of the cast for slapstick humor, do not help an already implausible story.  Small wonder Gene Roddenberry did not consider this film to be canonical Trek.The special effects, which are crude and amateurish, do not help matters.  However, the special effects during the original series were often sub-par, yet the old shows continue to satisfy even in today's CGI era.  (Anyone with any doubts about that should simply check how well the Original Series DVDs have been selling on Amazon.) The anemic visuals merely add to the problems here because they are coupled to a weak script.About the most charitable thing one can say about this film is that it features a wonderful score from Trek veteran Jerry Goldsmith. But that is not enough to save this uninspiring quest.No complaints about the sound &amp; picture, although more extras would have been welcome.",N/A
675528,"Great movie! Very accurate, well-made, and entertaining for anyone who wishes to relive those adorable Shirley Temple days from when she was young. Ashley Rose Orr does a great acting job here, although I don't think she looked much like the real Shirley Temple. Sure, she had those same dimples and the curls, but I didn't see as much of a resemblance as I thought I would. But that doesn't matter, because it's Ashley Rose Orr's energy and adorable smile that made her believable as Shirley Temple, the little girl who stole the hearts of people worldwide during the Great Depression. The song and dance numbers were performed extremely well by Orr, and she was well supported by Connie Britton and Colin Friels, who portrayed Shirley's parents in the movie. I just found this to be a really sweet movie which gives viewers a good background on Shirley's younger life in the moviemaking business. Like Cherie Hapney, I'm also disappointed that Shirley Temple didn't get the part of Dorothy in ""The Wizard of Oz,"" although Judy Garland did play the part well. But we're not talking about Judy Garland here, we're talking about Shirley Temple. And I definitely recommend this autobiographical account on the talented young woman's life from ages 5 to 12.",N/A
676517,"To those of you who were reading the other rviews, the review titled, &quot;PR dept. hard work.....&quot; is completely wrong.  They were not testing for alternate endings.  The whole story is based upon the greek myth of Orpheus.  You can tell by watching the movie that that story is loosely parallel.  Secondly, before I talk about the movie as a whole I will tell you why, I believe there are pop songs in a movie based in Paris during 1900.  In the movie it talks about the Bohemian Revolution.  People that participated in the revolution were called bohemians.  Bohemians wrote in the style, going in the whole idea of the revolution, of reminiscing about youth experiences, making things that were unique and groundbreaking, they tested the edges of acceptability, and rarely, if ever, gave credit to things of the future.  The writers picked Moulin Rouge as the place where the story was set because it was in the past and didn't give them any reason to give credit to a place of the future.  The pop songs are in it because the writers are reminiscing of songs from their youth, even some of its audience's youth.  This combination of pop songs in 1900 tests the edges of acceptability, and it is so well put together that it is unique and groundbreaking.  Now, this movie is so wonderful!  I went and saw this movie even without knowing anything about the plot except Nicole Kidman is a hooker in a nightclub and falls for a penniless writer (Ewan MacGregor).  I think it was much better that way.  The musical numbers are terrific, especially Tango de Roxanne(in which the tension bulids every layer of the song, I had no idea that music could add so much to a movie), and the rendition of Come What May at the end of the movie.  Many people say that the way Nicole and Ewan fall in love is stupid.  They have barely met and Ewan sings Your Song and Nicole falls straight in love with him.  Yeah it's kind of dumb, but hey, all musicals are like that, if you were expecting Silence of the Lambs you're out of luck, but if you were expecting an amazing love story you're in for a treat.  Once you get past when they first fall in love, this movie is a gem!  Those of you who are still skeptical, it is a knid of melodrama, and it's a romance, and it's a tragedy, it's so many things!

But the movie ended up surprisingly well-recieved. Kubrick had spanwed a comedy that could only be summed up in one word... INSANE!!!The story begins with Gen. Ripper ordering a nuclear attack on Russia which, in effect would cause a massive retaliation back at the U.S. Now it's a race against time to prevent a nuclear holocaust, and still keep good relations with Russia. &quot;Dimitri, I understand how you feel. How do you think I feel?&quot;After all these years &quot;Strangelove&quot; is still one one the funniest films to ever be made. It's also one of the more pure comedies ever made. It's rare you come across a comedy without the use of perverted jokes consisting of rude bodily functions and dirty sex. &quot;Dr. Strangelove&quot; possesses a wonderful balance of verbal and physical comedy. An example being a hilarious scene where Strangelove is promoting an absurd notion of reproducing the human race in bunkers while dueling with his malignant right hand. It doesn't get better than that.The special edition DVD pays an excellent tribute to both Staney Kubrick and The film with two highly in-depth behind the scenes featurettes, and along with an also humorus theatrical trailer. This is one of the most influential films ever made so please watch it and see what I mean.","Dr. Strangelove: Or, How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Bomb"
18385,"The movie begins with the suicide of a government official.  Next it shows a young woman who spends time playing computer games for profit, and dines on pizza and chocolate candy.  Her life is solitary, communicating mainly thru telephone lines.  (An earlier incident in Angela's life made her withdrawn.)  A package is delivered, and she runs the enclosed diskette.  Because of the diskette's secret, great danger enters her life.The story tells how her identity can be stolen, and official records created, to make her a wanted criminal.  She survives many attempts to kill her, but her close friends do not.  All because of that diskette, whose secret is slowly revealed.The secret of the diskette is how a &quot;bug&quot; was installed into protection software to create a 'trap door' that can be used to allow a person to access any computer, and then browse, create, or modify the data.  This is NOT fiction - some software does come with defaults to allow access.  (I once heard a person boast that his former firm had a tradition of doing this.)Angela discovers that a deliberately incorrect medical diagnosis was created to induce the suicide of that government official. After escaping dangers, she succeeds in sending the information to the FBI, and the plot is uncovered.  (Did you note the resemblance of 'Jeff Gregg' to the fictional 'Will Styles'?)The movie's style and scenes reminds me of Alfred Hitchcock: an innocent on the run due to a mistaken identity, or stumbling into a secret plot.  The parade scene recalls &quot;Blowout&quot;, the ending on the catwalk recalls &quot;The Parallax View&quot;.  Some criticize this for copying, but I would call it &quot;best practices&quot;.

218117,"I'm a sap for a good romantic comedy and this has to be included among my all time favorites.  It is sweet, romantic, schmaltzy, enchanting and funny.  Princess Ann (Audrey Hepburn) is feeling overwrought by her royal obligations and tight schedule.  She longs to be free of the burden of privilege, so one night in Rome she slips out of the royal accommodations late at night to see the city.  The trouble is she has just been given a sedative, which has a similar effect to that which alcohol has on a lush on a bender.  She is discovered sleeping near a fountain by Joe Bradley (Gregory Peck), who takes her to his apartment to sleep it off despite his better judgment.  Joe is a reporter who is supposed to interview the princess the next day, though he doesn't recognize her (extremely implausible, but alright, it is a necessary plot device and this was before TV was ubiquitous).When he realizes who she is, he plots to conduct a surreptitious personal interview with her by showing her around the town and not telling her that he is a reporter.  What results is a charming jaunt about historic Rome that turns into instant love.  There are numerous zany scenes and lots of slapstick humor, but it all works because Hepburn and Peck are so fabulous together.This film was directed by legendary director William Wyler (Ben Hur, The Best Years of Our Lives, Wuthering Heights), who chose wonderful locations throughout Rome to give the romance a storybook flavor.  Audrey Hepburn won a best actress Oscar for her performance as the lovely and impetuous princess.  It was a rich and adorable performance, which that was both captivating and amusing.  The scenes where she was intoxicated were precious and her nave view of the world was endearing.  Gregory Peck was dashing as the knave, with his understated flair for ironic and physical comedy.  Eddie Albert (most famous for TV's Green Acres) adds to the fun as Joe's scheming photographer who spends much of the film getting drenched and falling down.This film was nominated for ten Academy Awards, including best picture, director, actress, costumes and story.  It won only three (actress, story and costumes) in a year dominated by ""From Here to Eternity""(Eleven Nominations, Eight Oscars).  It is a delightfully entertaining story that is as enjoyable today as it was in 1953.  I rated it a 10/10.  If you enjoy romantic comedies, you can't go wrong with this film.",N/A

South American's accents been mocked. It all sounded like heaven. And it was. Everyone got more out of Dr. Strangelove or: How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Bomb than anyone had the right to expect for an independent film of 1964.U.S. Air Force General Jack Ripper (Sterling Hayden) goes completely and utterly mad, and sends his bomber wing to destroy the U.S.S.R. He suspects that the communists are conspiring to pollute the &quot;precious bodily fluids&quot; of the American people. The U.S. president meets with his advisors, where the Soviet ambassador tells him that if the U.S.S.R. is hit by nuclear weapons, it will trigger a &quot;Doomsday Device&quot; which will destroy all plant and animal life on Earth. Peter Sellers portrays the three men who might avert this tragedy: British Group Captain Lionel Mandrake, the only person with access to the demented Gen. Ripper; U.S. President Merkin Muffley, whose best attempts to divert disaster depend on placating a drunken Soviet Permier; and the former Nazi genius Dr. Strangelove, who concludes that &quot;such a device would not be a practical deterrent for reasons which at this moment must be all too obvious&quot;. Will the bombers be stopped in time, or will General Jack Ripper succeed in destroying the world?George C. Scott, Sterling Hayden, Slim Pickens and James Earl Jones are all excellent in memorable scenes, but this is clearly Sellers' show, even over Stanley Kubrick's never-better directing detail. Sellers' performance is one of the most stunning, extraordinary and utterly brilliant performances ever put to screen. He always gives the film its comedy and he'll put a smile on your face, and volcanically erupts the comic humour deep down in his intriguing characters. There are many classical scenes; the phone conversation between a woman in a bikini who argues with her bosses' boss; the hilarious quote ""Gentleman - you can't fight in here, this is the war room"" and of course that ending, a final shot in a film that is one of the finest to memory.Dr. Strangelove or: How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Bomb has one of the longest titles in film history, but damn, it's all over too quickly! But, since there is not a film by Stanley Kubrick that matches this one, it's a must-buy, and you'll be staring at Dr. Strangelove or: How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Bomb all day after you've spent your money. It's quite simply the best, most classical dark comedy ever made.","Dr. Strangelove: Or, How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Bomb"

93271,"First off, I will state that this is a fabulous piece of film-making.  The direction is strong, the period recreation is amazing, the editing is mind-blowing, and the cast is phenomenal...particularly Gary Oldman as Lee Harvey Oswald.  His performance is right on key and he looks incredibly similar to Oswald...just as he looked like Sid Vicious in &quot;Sid and Nancy&quot; and Ludwig Van Beethoven in &quot;Immortal Beloved.&quot;  Oldman is a chameleon who can seemingly look like anyone.  He becomes the characters that he plays, and his turn as Oswald is no exception.  Now...on to the substance of the film.  This film is not 100% accurate, nor does it purport to be anything other than an educated guess as to what MAY have happened in Dallas on November 22, 1963.  It is, however, leaps and bounds ahead of the Warren Commission Report, which isn't even believable in the slightest.  I may not be convinced that this film's vision of the truth (based on books by Jim Garrison and Jim Marrs) is the whole truth and nothing but the truth, but I've done my own research and I find it to be far closer to a believable theory than that proposed by the Warren Commission, whose report was...let's face facts, America...pure fiction.  Anyone who believes that lone nut Lee Harvey Oswald killed JFK needs to take his or her blinders off and start living in the real world.  Still, one cannot say that Oswald (one of the most fascinating characters in American history) was not capable of amazing feats...like simultaneously being active in the Soviet Union and the United States...though that's easily explained when one takes the time to find a copy of the memo sent from J. Edgar Hoover himself to the Department of State on June 3, 1960, which reads in part &quot;Since there is the possibility that an imposter is using Oswald's birth certificate, any current information the Department of State may have concerning the subject will be appreciated.&quot;  There you have it...as far back as 1960, there were at least two Lee Harvey Oswalds running around.  Not to mention that the LHO who was treated for tonsillitis twice during his stint with the Marines was obviously not the LHO who had his tonsils removed at the age of six.  Nor was the LHO who had a 3-inch mastoidectomy scar behind his ear and a gunshot scar on his elbow the same LHO who was autopsied after being gunned down by Jack Ruby.  There were AT LEAST two Oswalds active at the time of JFK's assassination...and many eyewitnesses have stated that they saw the police escorting Lee Harvey Oswald out of the rear exit of the Texas Theatre at the very same time that the Lee Harvey Oswald who was charged with JFK's murder was being led out the front.  It is, therefore, possible that while Oswald's double (who is said to have resembled the real Oswald a great deal) may have been involved in the assassination and killed officer J.D. Tippitt, the real Oswald was taken into custody, while his double was led out the back of the very same theatre and set free.  At any rate, there is a wealth of information out there, waiting to be discovered.  My advice is to watch this brilliant film, but not to take it at face value.  While you're at it, read up on the assassination.  Start with &quot;Crossfire&quot; by Jim Marrs, and once you've made it through that lengthy volume, move onto other independent research.  Much can even be found on the internet, including Armstrong's detailed outlines of the existence and movements of the two Oswalds...up to and including the day of the assassination.  Gather all of the information and decide for yourself.  But don't swallow the answers that are being force-fed to you...because almost invariably, they're lies.",JFK Director's Cut
676414,"I have to agree with most `Techies that the `Southern Cross' chapter of the ROBOTECH saga is probably the weakest of the bunch. I found it a bit too cutesy at times, and the storyline often took severe leaps in logic that make some of the more implausible moments in other 80s `toonage seem down-to-earth. Also, due partly to the abrupt cancellation of the Southern Cross when it was originally broadcast in Japan, it ended without really developing most of the characters to the fullest. And whoever cast the voice actor who did the dub for Zor shoulda been made to suffer a slow and painful death! Still, it does have its moments. And when it comes to my fave shows on video, I'm a completist-- I just gotta have `em all!Much like the previous ROBOTECH eppies put on disc, the picture &amp; sound quality of this batch ain't that much better than what I used to see &amp; hear on VHS. But, at least the DVDs have more eppies per plateer than any of the VHS videos had per tape, making this series an amazing shelf-space saver. That, and I don't have to worry about degradation after endless viewings. So, at least there's a bright side to the situation.The bonus disc in this particular set contained a surprising addition: the first episode of the English-language rendition of `Macross' before it was incorporated into the Robotech saga and re-dubbed! Until now, the only way to get this rare piece of anime history was eBay for a legitimate VHS tape (VERY expensive!)  or the bootleg market. This pilot has the same voice actors in the same roles, and most of the original dialogue spoken here remained intact in the Robotech re-do. Also included are a few scenes that were eventually trimmed from the Robotech rendition. Unless you're a really observant viewer of the show, the restored parts may pass you by without a second thought!Also included are a few bits of media regarding the unreleased and largely-unseen `Robotech: The Movie', most of which didn't impress me all that much. Both the teaser trailer and music video (3 Dog Night's ""In My Heart"") weren't all that spectacular, and contained only `Southern Cross' footage that was cannibalized and stuck into the film. None of the cannibalized `Megazone 23' scenes are present. The Robotech movie animatic is basically the dialogue &amp; sound track from the end of the movie, with shots of the corresponding rough storyboard sketches. This little bit of anime proto-cinema is probably one of the only moments from the movie that'll ever see a legitimate video release. Don't feel too bad about this revelation, though-I've actually viewed `Robotech: The Movie', and believe you me, you're not missing out on much.Also included on the bonus platter are several sketches of various Southern Cross body armor &amp; transports that never made it into the finished series. Most of the body armor designs are reminiscent of Samurai uniforms &amp; the robots of M.S. Gundam. And, like the previous bonus platters, this one includes a few clips dubbed in French, Italian, Portuguese, and Spanish.`Late",Robotech - Masters - Legacy Collection 5
214260,"STAR TREK IV: THE VOYAGE HOME(USA - 1986)Aspect ratio: 2.39:1 (Panavision)Theatrical soundtrack: 6-track Dolby StereoThe fourth instalment in a series initiated by STAR TREK: THE MOTION PICTURE in 1979, this glorious confection opens with joyous, celebratory theme music by veteran composer Leonard Rosenman, setting an appropriate tone for the entire film. In the words of director Leonard Nimoy, ""Trek IV"" is a 'caper', an old-fashioned fish-out-of-water scenario in which the crew of the 'Enterprise' travel backwards in time to 1986 to capture a pair of humpbacked whales (extinct in their own era), the only creatures capable of answering the signal from a monstrous, towering probe which is orbiting 23rd century Earth and causing havoc on a worldwide scale. The ecological message may simply be a by-product of the clever script, but it underlines the narrative at every turn, making serious what might otherwise have been little more than a lightweight, throwaway entry in the long-running franchise.Though Kirk, Spock and McCoy necessarily hog the limelight, as usual, all of the secondary characters - Scotty, Uhura, Chekov and Sulu - play a vital role in the development of the story, and each one contributes a substantial element to the overall structure. It's good to see these hugely talented (and frankly under-appreciated) supporting players finally given an opportunity to strut their stuff on the big screen, and the results are by turns funny, dramatic and quietly moving. Favorite bits: Scotty's hilarious 'interaction' with a 20th century computer; and something which happens in the closing minutes before the end titles, surely one of the most rapturous, spine-tingling moments in the entire history of the Trek phenomenon. Poignantly, and without any trace of irony, this otherwise joyful movie is dedicated to the crew of the space shuttle Challenger which met with disaster in 1986.By the way, UK prints of this movie open with a brief recap of events in Trek II and III (running 3m 30s) which is completely absent from the American version.Followed by STAR TREK V: THE FINAL FRONTIER (1989).",N/A

Anyway, Braveheart is nothing short of spectacular. The battle sequences are breathtaking, epic, and completely convincing. Mel Gibson does an excellent job directing such a large scale project and Braveheart succeeds on multiple levels. The character development is excellent and the viewer comes to deeply care about the Wallace character and his motley crew. At it's core, Braveheart is a love story.

527828,"Nobody watching ""Nutty Professor II:  The Klumps"" could ever doubt either Eddie Murphy's extraordinary talent for comic impersonation nor the ingenious skill of the special effects team that has managed to bring the actor's many characters to fruition on film.  The utterly seamless merging of all Murphy's personas into a single shot is indeed something wondrous to behold.  Unfortunately, no amount of acting or technical expertise can compensate for a weak script - for a comedy is, after all, only as good as its writing.  In the case of ""NP II,"" the writing leaves a great deal to be desired.In many ways, the film's greatest strength turns out, ultimately, to be its greatest weakness.  Murphy is so good at delineating and inhabiting his characters that it is quite understandable that the filmmakers would want to apportion virtually equal time to each and every one of them.  This turns out to be a problem.  For one thing, it manages to dilute the focus of the film's storyline quite frequently.  Time and again, we find the narrative wandering back and forth between unrelated situations.  Just as we become involved in the affairs of one character, we shift over to the quandaries of another.Still, this would be acceptable if the film at least managed to be funny.  It does offer a few laughs along the way, but the film's script rarely rises above the waistline in its humor.  If a joke doesn't deal with a specific body part (and we're not talking about hands, feet and noses here), it probably deals with a bodily function either sexual or scatological in nature.  I have no personal objection to dirty jokes, but when an entire film consists of nothing BUT such jokes, the whole enterprise ultimately becomes tasteless, tedious and unpleasant.  Take heed if you plan on watching this film with your young children (and note that this isn't even the UNCENSORED version!).In terms of acting, Murphy proves once again his phenomenal ability to create characters who are offbeat, individualized and likable.  What a shame that the filmmakers were not able to craft a vehicle commensurate with his talent.",N/A

350405,"A young man is torn between being a violinist and a prizefighter. Lifelong friends since this 1939 film, Bill Holden always gave credit to Stanwyck for helping him with his rather difficult role of Joe Bonaparte, the Golden Boy of the title. Very green as an actor, Holden had a tough battle to succeed in the role; Stanwyck spent time giving him acting advice(she had acted in films a dozen years already) and her coaching was in no small part of an amazing performance coming from such a novice. Barbara is in typical excellent form; her Lorna Moon is blunt and without illusions (she usually was, wasn't she?) - clearly a woman who ""knows the score"". Much of the film seems oversimplified today with unneccesary sentiment with Lee J. Cobb in a rather overwrought performance as Joe's ""You-a-gooda-boy"" Italian pop. However, the picture retains solid virtues in the authentic fight scenes and the ""real"" performances of three pros: Stanwyck, Menjou and Calleia. In a year too rich with fabulous movies (It's highly doubtful that 1939 will EVER be matched again for the number of superlative movies released in a single year) Golden Boy did mediocre business.

484860,"Being a big fan of the book, I was eagerly awaiting the movie.  I was caressing the DVD cover as I quickly plowed through the book.  In watching the DVD, I was absolutely impressed with how very closely the book related to the movie.  One who read the book can recite the movie lines before they happen.However, as other reviewers have written, there is something missing.  The roles played by Laura and Barry were very well done.  John Cusack makes a very disappointing Rob.  He plays the role well in actuality, but his narrative to the camera is not at all convincing.  Furthermore, we do not get a sense of the evolution of Rob (please read my book review).  When one reads the book, the astute reader can see the point of High Fidelity is to allow Rob to mature, get onto the next phase of life.  This is only inferred in the movie, while it is overstated in the book.  One cannot blame the reason as there is too much information the screenplay writers needed to mirror the book.  The all important part in the book (where Rob meets with Laura's friends...Miranda and David maybe?) was crucial as it revealed that Rob had been successful in turning into a mature adult.  This was only implied in the movie, and its omission did more harm than good.  The whole notion of Rob's relationships being correlated with death was completely abandoned.So four stars for an excellent portrayal of the book (a feat very few movies can do.)  Most fans who love the movie will have read the book only on level 1 (the surface level, strictly about his relationships and pop music.)  Those who read the book on level 2 about his self-evolution will find this missing from the film.  Again, one cannot blame the screenplay writers.  With such limited time allowed for content, as well as the hacking by editors (notice the deleted scenes from the movie also being loyal to the book), one needs to lean one way or the others.  The screenplayers leaned towards level 1 which is fine if that is your motivation.",High Fidelity VHS

To be totally honest, I expected something of the &quot;Scream&quot; genre... a not so scary movie with a bunch of &quot;pretty white kids with problems&quot; running around, having sex, and eventually getting offed by some superhuman psycho.  Boy, was I surprised!This has got to be one of the most imaginative horror films I've ever seen.  The premise of the film is great and the movie itself is well written.  This is not your typical horror film.On a side note, I have to disagree with the reviewer who said that previous knowledge of urban legends ruins the movie.

206429,"you get the feeling that morrison was sorta distant and cold when the doors gave this performance at the hollywood bowl, and it's also obvious that he was tripping on acid (no surprise). this show is still certainly worth watching, though, and occasionally we hear genuine passion in morrison's voice, especially when he recites a piece from celebration of the lizard. when asked what he thought of this performance, mick jagger allegedly called it &quot;a bore&quot;. this may be true for some of the songs, but when they start playing &quot;the end&quot; morrison really turns on, and any fan of his will be utterly hypnotized by probably the best recorded version of that song that they have on tape. watch how he covers his eyes with his hand during the oedipal section and then breaks out in depraved and evil laughter while expressing his frantic desire to do something a little unsavory with his mother--utterly fascinating. this should give you some idea of how complex and brilliant morrison was:even his mediocrities and half hearted efforts are totally hypnotic.",N/A
349508,"Agatha Christie wrote &quot;Death on the Nile&quot; in 1937, one year after &quot;Murder in Mesopotamia&quot;, and to all appearances &quot;Death on the Nile&quot; was intended as a prequel to &quot;Murder in Mesopotamia&quot;, which itself was a prequel to the 1934 classic &quot;Murder in the Orient Express&quot;. The three stories make up a satisfying trilogy of mysteries as Poirot tours the Near East finding murder everywhere he goes.All three of the stories follow Christie's tried-and-true formula: She introduces the cast of suspects, gives each of them a dark secret and a motive to lie, and piles up the circumstances in such a way that the flying fickle finger of suspicion points to every one of them at some time or another. She compounds the confusion by supplying false leads and deliberatly glossing over hot clues. In each case Poirot holds his cards close to his vest, tantalizes the reader/listener with cryptic comments, and finds the most inconsequential-appearing facts to be highly significant. Eventually Poirot airs everyone's dirty laundry, explains his chain of deductive reasoning, reconstructs the crime in all its improbable complexity, and gets a confession.Of the three stories, however, &quot;Death on the Nile&quot; presents the most feasible modus operandi for the murder, as well as the most likely motivation for murder. This is a roudabout way of saying that &quot;Death on the Nile&quot; is the most realistic of the three.The Peter Ustinov movie stays faithful to the plot and gives the viewer some excellent scenes of Egyptian ruins along the Nile.  The star-studded cast turns in good performances.  Having first seen David Suchet as Poirot, I could not help but be somewhat disappointed with Peter Ustinov as Poirot.  Of all the Poirot movies starring Ustinov, however, this is the best.",Death on the Nile VHS
312205,"'Andrei Rublev' is one of the most beautiful and disturbing meditations upon faith I have ever witnessed. As a film it is consistently astonishing - so many of the images are unforgettable, the musical score is fragile and haunting, and the overall conception so inspiring that, personally speaking, it restored my faith in the power of film.  Along with Tarkovsky's other works, 'Rublev' is more akin to poetry than to simple narrative prose. Rather than approaching it as a regular film, I find it helpful to imagine that I'm about to enter an art gallery and view an exhibition by a master.  It repays repeated viewings, and it is not a film to hurry you along with the urgencies of plot - Tarkvovsky, as he often states in his writings, is concerned with  the nature and effect of time in the context of cinema - the pace then is contemplative.  There are few if any commercial considerations motivating the making of this film, so unsurprisingly it inhabits a world entirely alien to that of mainstream Hollywood.*The opening scene reveals a Russian Icarus attempting to 'fly'. His faith must overcome not only his own fear, but the wrath of others who find his ambition threatening. He escapes and we inhabit his point of view, one approximating that of God perhaps, Tarkovsky depicting the landscape and its people as something suddenly abstract. The frighteningly primitive hot air balloon inevitably fails, and as it hisses in its final resting place it appears as something organic, like some grotesque human organ proving its mortality.  The soundtrack throughtout this scene is particularly evocative.*After this the monk, Andrei Rublev, is introduced and a series of events demonstrates and tests his faith in himself, in God, and in other human beings. Images of the worst cruelty and barbarism are juxtaposed with ideas of transcendent beauty - at one point the whitened interior of a pavillion is inexplicably filled with softly floating feathers and down (this looks likes snow, but the commentary tells otherwise); at another, a peasant village is drawn as if from a painting by Bruegel; a pagan ritual has torch fires flashing through a nocturnal forest. From these backgrounds emerge sounds that seem almost supernatural - the lone female voice that comes intermittently, her song like the most delicate filament imaginable, being the one that stays with me most.*The final scene is truly climactic. A boy, who is alone in the world, apparently leans on knowledge passed on from his father in order to fashion a magnificent bell for his ruler - in so doing he is risking his life, for he will be killed if the bell is not resonant. The construction of this bell is enthralling, the firing of the metal and the pouring, spectacular. Ultimately it is revealed, however, that the boy has not placed his faith in his father, but in himself, in his art, and, it is implied, in God.  Rublev comforts the child and this moment serves as an epiphany after which Rublev's faith in his own vocation is restored. The film erupts into colour at its close, as we are left with ravishing images of Orthodox iconography, Rublev's faith made incarnate.*If this film appeals, then it is easy to recommend Tarkovsky's other works, especially 'Nostalghia' and 'The Mirror'; Tarkovsky was also an admirer of the films of Carl Theodor Dreyer, and the latter's films are some of the very few that, for mine, equal Tarkovsky's achievement.*The Criterion DVD has excellent picture quality and sound - better than the prints I've seen in theatres. If you have a widescreen TV the format can be optimised by setting for 'zoom' and adjusting the vertical pitch of the image until the black bar on the top of the screen disappears - the subtitles will then be fully visible below the frame. (Actually, I'd suggest trying to view the film with the subtitles turned off - particularly on a third or fourth viewing - for me, the visuals become all the more overwhelming.)",N/A

130309,"I viewed this film for the second time tonight, and will admit that I did not enjoy it as much as I did the first time.  There are more than a few flaws in the screenwriting and possibly even directing that comes short of making the film complete and satisfying.  However, I felt the message was somewhat provoking and atleast well-intentioned.Most people who hated this movie seem to think that this film was very &quot;anti-military.&quot;  Being that I'm not in the military myself (a few of my friends are), my attention was not focused on how sensitively the film dealt with the topic.  I notice now after the second showing that a few lines here and there seemed to hint towards anti-military sentiments.  However, whether it be the military, the government, the Church, the education system, we cannot deny that corruption is possible in any standing institution.Gang-rape out of jealousy?  A general who covers up the crime in efforts to save the face of West Point?  Perhaps they shouldn't have used so directly the name of West Point and instead, referred to it as some general academy.  I don't think gang-rape out of jealousy is impossible and farfetched.  Rape is a crime of hate and sexism in the military setting is very present.  One of my bestfriends is in the third highest command here at Virginia Tech with the Corps Cadets and she is constantly competing with the other men, and constantly scrutinized in their presence.  Being a female in the military is NOT easy, and resentment between students, especially between sexes, is not all that unlikely.As for the general covering up the crime -- why is that unrealistic?  If the media jumped all over the rape case, what female would feel safe applying to an institution where they are potential victims?  No university, whether military or civilian wants to have their rapes publicized.  It is bad for the name of the university and bad for their business.  For the general to have chosen to keep quiet about the rape of his daughter was not the moral decision but an easy way out for this predicament.And what are the responses from the child who has just been denied justice by her own father?  While I can't say I condone the acts she committed in order to capture her father's attention, I can say that I understand the psychology of a rape victim.  Refusing to bring her perpetrators to justice, and denying that the rape even happened told the daughter that she not only all alone in her situation, but that she was worthless and insignificant in her father's eyes.  Having to return to school and constantly facing the fear of her &quot;faceless&quot; perpetrators must have also been traumatizing.  This experience alone is enough to carve a wound so deep into a person's soul that revenge seems to be the only path of fulfillment.A few major flaws in the film were the re-creation of the rape and who actually murdered her.  Timothy Hutton's character lacked depth and the screenwriting failed to develop a strong tie between the victim and perpetrator, leaving the audience to think, &quot;Wait a minute, who is this guy and WHY did he kill her?&quot;  Their story seemed insignificant to the entire picture.  As for the re-creation of the rape, why wasn't More there to watch if anything badly happened to her?  Was he just expecting that her own father would untie her?  What if he decided that he would not, and she was left all alone out there all night long?  Didn't she have a better back up plan than that?  Furthermore, I was appalled that none of the men who saw her out there tried to cover her body when immediately saw her (it just appears psychologically inaccurate).  I mean, isn't that a person's first instinct, to cover up someone's exposed body?  Another flaw is the fact that More was the last to find out about Elizabeth's murder.  If he had been the one to help her stage the scene, why wasn't he available for her the rest of the night incase she should want to be released from that humiliating position?  Some of this was just behaviorally inaccurate.James Cromwell reminded me of his Captain role in LA Confidential.  John Travolta, I personally thought, was good and entertaining (perhaps a little too gutsy, but hey, it's Hollywood).  Madeleine Stowe could have been used more, and definitely Hutton's character, as mentioned before, was underdeveloped (and too underdeveloped to be the killer, in my opinion).All in all, a pretty decent film about the psychological warfare that occurs between a parent and a child, and how it can explode and branch out into many evils just because the parent was cause for deficits in the child.",N/A

The action is mostly confined to a single house and involves conflict between just two characters, yet the tension is palpable.  Bates' character undergoes violent and frightening mood swings, which are expertly played.  Caan's air of quiet desperation is also well-done.  William Goldman's script also deserves mention: the characters behave intelligently, so it is enjoyable to watch the cat-and-mouse game that unfolds before us.",N/A

564154,"Buffy The Vampire Slayer's first season was a short one due to the fact it debuted in March of 1997 and the television season ends in May.  But despite the fact season one only consists of twelve episodes, they pack as much power as any debut season of any show on television.  Throughout the first season, we are introduced to all the major players in addition to Buffy including Xander, Willow, Giles and Angel.  Angel starts off as a minor character, but as the season progresses he and Buffy become more involved and his role elevates.  Season one continuing plot revolves around The Master who is the supreme vampire.  He is trapped in the Hellmouth and throughout the season chronicles his attempt to be freed.  Even though the main focus is on fighting vampires, other demons arise.  One particularly strong episode is where Xander and several other students are possessed with the spirits of hyenas.  They develop the attributes of hyenas including the pack mentality.  This episode really shows the brilliance of Joss Whedon as the hyenas are a metaphor for the clique and pack mentality of high school and how the strong packs pick on the weaker ones.  Buffy is a rare show that combines humor, drama, the supernatural into a show that can scare you, make you laugh and touch you all in one episode.",N/A
572742,"This made-for-cable movie is an honest attempt to boil down Jimi Hendrix's life and music down to less than two hours.  Unfortunately the producers were unable to obtain the rights to any of Jimi's songs, so the musical score is entirely made of up his covers (Hey Joe, All Along the Watchtower, Wild Thing, etc.) plus some unattributed jamming.  You get the typical 60s montages (JFK, Malcom X, the Beatles, Dylan, etc.) along with the cookie-cutter dialogue and vastly oversimplified story.Despite some good performances, the script doesn't really offer the scope to examine why Hendrix's music was so revolutionary, or the problems that led to his early death.There's not much fire here, either, as the film suffers from wooden pacing and is never especially absorbing.The documentary film &quot;Jimi Hendrix&quot;, also available on DVD, is a far better way to gain an appreciation of this artist.",Hendrix
215932,"REVISED REVIEW FOR BLU-RAY ""Full Disclosure Edition"" on Blu-ray)""Apocalypse Now almost described what happened to Francis Ford Coppola himself with this film. Originally Copppola was just going to produce and George Lucas was going to direct but Coppola eventually found himself in the director's chair in the Phillipines and with millions of dollars of sets destroyed by bad weather. Coppola found himself on a journey to the heart of darkness as production continued endlessly, Coppola continued to rewrite and reshoot footage, Martin Sheen had a heart attack and Coppola had what can best be described as a nervous break down.This new deluxe Blu-ray edition has been prepared from a new high definition transfer that has been color corrected and is presented in the correct aspect ratio for the first time. The new transfer looks quite good for the original version of the film (my preferred version)and ""Redux"" Coppola's rethink of the original film (which has some worthwhile moments and is interesting as an alternate take of the original vision but can't possibly replace the original flawed masterpiece).This edition also includes Eleanor Coppola's documentation of the insanity that surrounded the making of this film; ""Heart of Darkness"" is a marvelous documentary and receives its first HD transfer. Keep in mind that it was originally shot in 16mm so while it doesn't quite have the sharper look of the original film (or ""Redux""), it has never looked better on home video.We get a huge amount of extras including the following new material--Francis Ford Coppola interviewing Martin Sheen (which is quite interesting given their shared experience and recollection of the insanity of the shoot); Coppola with screenwriter John Milius (Coppola recognizes Milius' important contribution to the script since HE wrote the original drafts that Coppola ended up working with as director); Orson Welles (who originally was going to direct a film version of ""Heart of Darkness"" for RKO before settling on ""Citizen Kane"")in a radio production of Joseph Conrad's novel; the entire interview of Coppola by Roger Ebert.Carried over from the previous edition are Coppola's audio commentary as well as both versions of the film (that way you can watch which version you want--although be advised this has the ORIGINAL 70mm theatrical ending which fades out WITHOUT the footage of the destruction of Kurtz's compound--that was added later to the 35mm print when it went into wide release although that footage IS included as with the previous edition as an extra). The bulk of the original special features are carried over to this edition as well. Due to time constraints I haven't had time to dig into all the other extras that were carried over from the previous edition although it appears on the surface to be exactly the same as the previous edition from Paramount Home Video.""Hearts of Darkness"" includes a commentary track by Coppola and his wife Eleanor and on that same disc we also get excerpts from Millius'original script with Coppola's notes, storyboard gallery as well as marketing archive. I haven't had a chance to do more than peak at ""Hearts of Darkness"" (although I did have the previous edition which also had the commentary track on DVD)and haven't had a chance to really look at the extras on this disc so I can't provide any info on them beyond citing that they are here.We also get a lovely 48 page soft cover book with behind-the-scenes photos, an excerpt of the guide given to the production personnel on their arrival on location pointing out restaurants, etc. and a copy of the pages from Coppola's edition of Joseph Conrad's novel that Coppola kept with him for inspiration and notes.""Apocalpyse Now"" would be Coppola's truly last great film (although he would make some exceptional ones in its wake)and proved to almost be his own personal apocalpyse where the director began to question the wisdom of making the film in the first place. While it isn't a flawless classic (what is?), even it's flaws in the original version are made up for by the ambition and vision Coppola delivers. In the case of ""Redux"" it's an interesting variation on the original but can't quite compete and comes across almost as an after thought--an interesting one--but one that doesn't quite pay off as well as the original film did in 1979 and even today.",N/A

I particularly liked the fight scene in the restaurant and the chase in the streets. Anita Mui, who plays his lover, is not as funny as in movies like Drunken Master II, but is still adding a nice touch to the comedic aspect of the film.Unfortunately, the quality for the picture and the sound of the DVD isn't what we're accustomed from Columbia/Tri-Star. A few scratches from time to time destroy a little bit our pleasure. And I can't believe that this edition is offered in mono only. It should at least have been in dolby surround.A strange thing is that the subtitled version on the disc is 127 mins. long, but the dubbed one on the other side of the disc is 106 mins. long.

195489,"I have watched a fair share of anime series in my time and I can honestly say Pet shop is definetly one of the most unique, interesting and fascinating ever. Not only are the stories creepy and full of nice little mean twists and wonderfully screwed up characters it's impossible not to love, but aside from LAIN this is the best dub work I have ever heard in an anime series.CONTENT: Even though all the stories are based on the same premise (&quot;don't brake these 3 rules or your pet will kill you&quot;) the stories all have different morales and ideas behind them making each show different from the last. DAUGHTER is about how too much love is not a good thing. DESIRE is about not confusing guilt with true love. DESPAIR is about living a short but happy life and be remembered for the good things. DUAL is about sacrificing everything for someone else and thus gaining one's own happiness. I like them all, and I LOVE the first one.DVD: has great features. True, the dleted material is really just a weird video opening that I thank God they didn't use on the show, but there are also a number of interesting trailers, and best of all a commentary with the director and the voice actors for Count D and Leon the cop.

371179,"Cecil B. DeMille approached Claudette Colbert for playing the title role in this fantasia/extravaganza on the life of Queen of the Nile. Obviously, the eccentric, egotistical DeMille took his pictures too seriously & they almost always have ""camp quality"" to them - which, incidentally, make them a lot of fun to watch! The pretentious dialogue is nigh hilarious at times (audiences laughed in 1934 as well!) Like most of DeMille""s biggest pictures, CLEOPATRA didn't exactly please the pious critics, but the public ate it up! The picture going public marveled at it's lavish 'kitsch' quality and savoured it's expensive excesses (i.e. when Cleo seduces Marc Antony, there are writhing and dancing females everywhere clad in seaweed; one is whipped into naked submission by a giant slave!) Colbert's versatility is astonishing in all actuality. In the year this was filmed (1934), she had played the role of Bea in the ultrasentimental IMITATION OF LIFE and won herself an AA for falling in love with Gable in IT HAPPENED ONE NIGHT. These are three very different roles and Colbert did each of them magnificently. Colbert never takes her interpretation of Cleo TOO seriously and she cleverly delivers her lines with tongue-in-cheek flair. Travis Banton created the lavishly daring costumes and although this flick is not exactly a history teachers' ideal, at least it didn't bore everyone to tears like the 1963 Liz Taylor epic.",Cleopatra VHS
523381,"This is, without doubt, one of the worst films I've seen in a loooooooooooong time.  A sad reminder that even the best directors can have an off-day - and another, and another, and ...The action opens with a battle scene, filmed in the woods near Farnham in Surrey, England, which is so wrapped in gloom and haze that it tells us precisely nothing other than that the Romans had a more advanced armoury than their Germanic foe.Anyway, lots of noise and fire - looks like a good old-fashioned epic, right?Wrong!To cut a long story short, there's a really hunky good guy - whose main problem is that he can't speak clearly, so most of the time we don't know what on earth he's talking about.  But I suspect this doesn't really matter, because even when he does stop mumbling he never says much of any interest anyway.Then there's a bad guy, and he's a patricidal creep of the first water who, amongst other things, has the good guy's family killed - so you can't wait for him to get what's coming to him.  Only you do have to wait - for ages, and ages.Oh yes, there's also a heroine - but this is a real &quot;mano a mano&quot;-type film, so she never gets to be anything more than incidental set dressing.Now, you're never going to guess how it all turns out.The good guy kills the bad guy.  But the good guy dies as well, so he can rejoin his family in the great bye and bye.  Then the film ends.Bet that surprised you, didn't it!Actually there is one highlight in the film - Oliver Reed, proving what a very talented actor he was when in the right mood.Even so, that Ridley Scott felt it worthwhile to drag this pretentious drivel out to nearly two and a half hours simply beggars belief.Tip 1: Always be wary of a film where the scriptwriter is also one of the producers.Tip 2: If this film is so great, how come people are queueing up to sell their copy?",Gladiator VHS

No cinematic work is perfect, but &quot;Cuckoo's Nest&quot; comes pretty darned close.Jack Nicholson is in his defining role as &quot;Jack McMurphy&quot;; his persona is not only ideal for the part, but his acting is absolutely splendid. Nicholson is supported by a wonderful cast that includes the painfully unforgettable performance of Louise Fletcher as &quot;Nurse Ratched.&quot; Several then unknown actors -- Christopher Lloyd and Danny DeVito among them -- round out the troupe beautifully. The redoubtable director Milos Forman guides his band of exceptional actors through an excellent screenplay and into cinematic immortality.While this DVD's picture quality leaves much to be desired, it's somehow fitting for this film. Strangely, the documentary-like quality of the movie make the prevalent grain and foreign matter appear as though they belong! This is the only film I've yet seen that doesn't seem to lose much for want of a good print. Still, objectively speaking, Warner showed no respect to this classic by allowing such a poor copy on DVD -- and providing a mediocre transfer to boot. (No surprise, they did a TERRIBLE job with &quot;The Stanley Kubrick Collection&quot;; so bad that they're redoing it.) Recorded sound is merely acceptable. The &quot;special features&quot; may once have been something, but they aren't any longer. DVD collectors expect more nowadays, not just a few pages of text.  In the end, however, this item remains a &quot;buy&quot;; it's relatively cheap, and it's the only available DVD version of this great movie.",One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest
293793,"First of all, concerning the DVD edition of THE STRANGER -- the version I own and am reviewing is the Hollywood Classics release.  This is the one that comes with the 30-minute documentary on Orson Welles and the (rather frightening) introduction by Tony Curtis.  The picture and sound looked quite adequate to me though there is an annoying &quot;Delta&quot; logo that appears occasionally in the bottom right-hand corner.  I had never seen the film before and purchased this DVD in a 3-pack of Orson Welles films.  For the low price, the value is excellent and the video quality is quite good, though I'm sure it isn't as clear as the more expensive version.  The customer will have to decide if they want to pay three times the price to get a cleaner version or get a serviceable copy for the lower cost.Now moving on to the film.  This movie is much more straightforward than the other Orson Welles films that I've seen.  We have a standard good guy and a standard bad guy, and each character is set up in his role almost immediately.  Edward G. Robinson plays the Nazi-hunter who has been tracking Orson Welles' character since the end of the Second World War.  Welles' plays a Nazi who has gone into hiding and is now living in small town America as a schoolteacher.  The acting from the two leads is spellbinding -- as good as any of their best work, with Welles in particular stealing the show.  Welles triumphs in the difficult task of playing a man who has successfully integrated himself in a community, yet allowing the audience to see him as the villain that he is.  The viewer never questions why the outlaw has been able to fool his friends and neighbors for months but can also pick up on the same clues that Robinson's character does.The story is not overly complicated and this allows us to pay a lot of attention to the different characters in the movie.  The townspeople, without exception, are all given their own motivations without slipping into repetition and the silly catchphrases that movies set in small towns tend to give to their characters.  There are also some excellent shots that could only have come from Welles' keen directorial eye.  The German's obsession with clocks is an interesting metaphor for the Nazi mindset, but this is kept to a minimum and never becomes overbearing.I highly recommend this interesting film for anyone who enjoys good acting and intriguing storylines.  The documentary included on the DVD is very superficial and most of the 30 minutes are taken up by trailers of films, some of which barely feature Orson Welles himself.  It's not something that the Welles fan is going to get too much out of and it does not contain enough information for the casual viewer.  The introduction by Tony Curtis is frighteningly odd.",N/A

58945,"This is the funniest, and most original comedy of the 90's. Bruce Campbell has an amazing talent for cartoon-like facial expressions and this movie puts him in the same class as Jim Carrey and Jonathan Winters. This is pure escapism from start to finish with lots of wonderfully cornball one-liners, &quot;That was just pillow talk baby&quot;. Although some women like this flick, it's safe to call this a guy movie, but what a guy movie! What's most impressive about the film is the refreshingly original style that Sam Raimi brings to the screen. What a thrill it must have been to work with talent like Campbell who should have become a mega-star after this came out. What a shame it flopped. Jim Carrey is also a great talent but this movie blows Pet Detective away without a doubt. If you like the flying creature that picks up the girl and flies away with her, it may interest you to know you can see it in person next time you visit Las Vegas. It's hanging in the doorway as you enter Planet Hollywood at Caesar's Palace. Bruce Campbell would be the perfect choice to star in a Superman parody if they ever made one. Watch this film and you'll see what I mean. There are times you get the feeling you are watching Clark Kent's long lost half-wit twin. (Hollywood Producers or Sam Raimi if you are reading this, please take note!) In the meantime, if you are looking for the ultimate drinking movie for the next time you get together with your buddies, look no further. The director's cut is awful however so beware. In that version they cut out half of the best one-liners and replaced the ending with something stupid. The real version contains a brilliantly funny ending in which a witch travels through time to a Sporting Goods Store. Classic! This movie will appeal to those who don't like horror movies (like myself). It's not a horror movie. And remember...clatau, nectu, cough! cough! Bow to the king baby!",N/A

450419,"Gwyneth Paltrow's best film to date, performance-wise, even better (I think) then 'Shakespeare in Love'. She plays Helen, and... Helen. Should be confusing, but surprisingly, isn't. The movie really picks up when Helen, who's just been fired from her major PR job in downtown London, misses a train. And then, rewind, she catches the train. What insues is a delightful, unique, and surpisingly deep film about what her life is like traveling down the two different paths. On one hand, she has lazy, scummy boyfriend Jerry, who you somehow can't help liking at least a little bit (at least, you never hate him as much as you'd like to). He's a great comic presence, confused and trying to do the right thing, but keeps tripping over his own self-indulgent feet. On the other hand, you have John Hannah's character, and good-hearted and hilarious bloke who's original and quite cute. The way Helen reacts with others in a scene is wonderful. Definitely worth watching over and over.",N/A
208839,"Well, this was never really my favorite movie. But the quality of much recent media has increased my opinion of &quot;Popeye&quot; quite a bit. Most people can not seem to make a movie these days without giving us all effects and no story, showering us with blood, sex, or profanity, trying to force feed us what is politically correct, or having someone killed every other minute. The fact that &quot;Popeye&quot; does not fall into any of these categories greatly increases my opinion of it. Now it is not the most worthy movie to be sure. HOWEVER, there are many memorable elements. The scenery is simple, but it does carry charm. The songs are cute and memorable. The town's fear of Popeye, and later its acceptance of him is realistic and well done. It is touching how Popeye fights through a difficult journey to find his father, and funny when he gets into different kinds of trouble on the way, and accidentally becomes the town's hero. (When he accidentally pushes the tax man into the water.) Popeye's father is handled well. First we hear of him. (Although we don't know the person everyone is talking about is Popeye's father.) Then we see him, and the resemblance to Popeye makes it obvious that he is Popeye's father; then they meet and discover each other. Popeye's final persuit of Bluto is suspenseful and hilarious. We finally see Popeye and his father together and they get on each other's nerves the whole way. Popeye's father even carries out his role as a father when he pushes Popeye into doing something so he can save the day! So while this is not exactly a smash hit, (in my opinion) it carries many worthy elements; it is worth the time; and while it may not become a classic, it will probably carry a strong cult following. If you have not seen it, do so. You may be pleasantly surprised.",Popeye
147906,"Fargo is a movie that I put off watching for 5 years for really no reason at all besides laziness or there were always &quot;better&quot; movies to rent.  Well, it's too bad I actually took the time to watch this so-called great movie.  The word that comes to mind is pointless and ridiculous.  That's 2 words, but oh well.  And the thing that I cannot believe is that this movie won awards.  Yeah, the acting is pretty darn good.  The accents are awesome.  To know that people actually speak that way is hysterical.  But, the movie really has no point.  There was a lot of pointless dialogue that added nothing to the movie besides getting to hear people say &quot;ya.&quot;  At times I didn't know whether to laugh or be shocked.  Normally if someone is shot in the face it's not very funny, but this movie seems to make it.  The humor is what kept me watching, but still, this is not a great movie by any lengths.  Overall, Fargo is an over hyped movie that fails to deliver anything besides a few laughs at some accents.  Not very exciting.  2 Stars",N/A

The movie's first half, set in 1930s Spain, is rather heart warming about a young boy and his elderly teacher.  The teacher singles the boy out for special kindness and tutoring, including giving the boy a butterfly net and their using the net to explore and understand the natural world. The teacher explains to the boy all the characteristics of a certain insect before setting it free again.  However, the Spanish Civil War creeps into the movie's second half and it divides its citizens so that they start turning on one another and urging one another's arrest to avoid the same themselves.  The story continues to follow the boy and the teacher through this growing ugliness until they themselves are enmeshed in the same conflict of citizen persecuting fellow citizen that every Civil War entails.

482335,"Scream gave us the motives and the major storyline, Scream 2 lengthened the storyline, and Scream 3 settled the motives and the storyline. That's how the trilogy went, and it was a fun ride.And in the third and final Scream, we see that Sidney is in hiding in the California hills and is ultimately paranoid. But who can blame her? She's only had 4 psychos kill almost 15 of her friends or people close to her. Meanwhile, Stab 3 is currently in production, with a now successful Cotton making a cameo in the movie and Dewey being a technical advisor on the movie. Suddenly, bodies began to turn up, and the killer leaves pictures of a young Sidney's mother with every victim. Now Sidney, Dewey, and Gale (who thinks she's hot on the case) and the remaining cast and crew of Stab 3 must try to survive, and Sidney must try to discover who the killer is, and why the pictures of her mother are turning up.With another all star cast, and great writing, Scream 3 ended the Scream trilogy in a way that combined all three Screams with a very surprising plot twist. Neve Campbell, David Arquette, and Courtney Cox-Arquette give their characters their usual moods and tones, and do it well. I personally love Courtney's character, Gale Weathers. New additions in Scream 3 are Parker Posey, Patrick Dempsey, Lance Henricksen, Jenny McCarthy, and many more talented actors. Parker Posey was certainly there for comedic relief. She was hilarious. There are also some surprise cameos. Ehren Kruger took over as writer, and did very well. As Scream movies do, they poke fun at the horror genre. Specifically a scene with Jenny McCarthy's character in which she complains about being having to die naked in Stab 3. And as with Scream and Scream 2, the horror-meister Wes Craven was in the director's chair. Wes' directing style is perfect for horror movies, and is very respectable to the genre.I love the Scream Trilogy, but I would NOT want another Scream. It ended the way it was supposed to, and if there is another, it would totally ruin the whole thing.As for the DVD, I thank Dimension Home Video for it. The video and audio transfers are great. We are TREATED with an assortment of deleted scenes or alternate takes, including an alternate ending. Although there really isn't much difference, it was still fun to watch. The commentary given by Wes and some of the crew is very interesting and they never quit talking, which is a good thing in this commentary's case because they always have something interesting to say.

264869,"Hideous Sun Demon, Robert Clarke's auteurist tour-de-force, aims for high drama but achieves drive-in monsterama cool instead. Apparently conceived as a sensitive portrayal of the inner torment of a man possessed by a strange condition beyond his control, they just didn't have the budget to bring it off. Besides, it's hard to work up sympathy for a character who, after being told by his doctor to stay home and not drink any alcohol, immediately heads out to the bar. Then there's the bosomy b-girl who's just had her boyfriend and his thugs work over our hero, who turns around and starts consoling him and takes him home. But the illogic's half the fun of this movie, and anyhow, we're really here for the cool Blaisdell-esque rubber Sun Demon, the rat-squishing, and Clarke's over-the-top performance. For cheese lovers there's plenty of bad acting and that let's-talk-about-it-cause-we-can't-afford-to-show-it thing going on. Giving credit where it's due, however, several locations are exploited for some interesting visuals. Basically, another fun hour-and-ten for the bad cinema set.Image's DVD presents the movie in the best edition I've seen yet. The source print is not flawless; there are a half dozen or so short (15 sec) stretches of distracting horizontal scratching, some intermittent light vertical scratching, and the usual very light to light speckling and spotting throughout. But overall it  looks quite good; sharp and detailed, with generally excellent tonal values. Other than the horizontal scratches, it blows the socks off my Starlog Video VHS copy, and if you're used to catching this on the late night monster shows you'll probably be quite pleased.

It added such a zest for life, and such a reality to it that the Brady Bunch never had! You connected with each child, and even I knew their names before the movie ended. Lucille Ball is superb in this role. I have rarely seen her play too much of the mother role, for I Love Lucy had Little Ricky, but he was just a side character. She beautifully portrayed the typical single Mom. Henry Fonda gave a stunning performance, which made you simple love him. You felt for him, and for his kids. One of the best scenes in the movie, is where all of his boys, when making a drink for Lucille Ball's character, unknowningly add liquor to her supposed screw driver. By unknowingly, I mean that they didn't know the others had also added something.

544142,"The hard truth is that it's been tough to be a John Carpenter fan for the past decade or so.Sure we remember that this the guy who gave us such classics as ""Assault on Precinct 13,""  ""Halloween,"" ""Escape From New York,"" and ""The Thing.""  Even his box office disappointments(""Big Trouble In Little China"", ""They Live"") were still better and more interesting than just about anything else to hit multiplex screens during his glory years of the mid-seventies through eighties.But by the early 1990s, Carpenter hit a slump that saw him cranking out one schlock film after another.  Think of  ""In the Mouth of Madness"" or ""Vampires.""For this reason, I was more than a little skeptical when ""Ghosts of Mars"" hit theaters last summer.  Even aside from J.C.'s recent track record, the film seemed a pastiche of other pop culture sources like ""Pitch Black,"" Ray Bradbury's ""The Martian Chronicles, and even Carpenter's own ""Precinct 13.""  But my curiosity got the better of me and I decided to take a chance.My verdict?  Forget all the negative hype about this film.  It's the movie Carpenter fans have been waiting for.Granted the film isn't the least bit scary.  It also doesn't ponder any weighty philosophical or political questions, like some of Carpenter's earlier films.  What it does offer however is a thoroughly entertaining sci-fi action pic that delivers plenty of ass-kickin' action with Carpenter's trademark cynicism thrown in to boot.I won't rehash the plot, since odds are you've already read the summary above.  Instead, I'll focus on some other things I liked about this film, like the cast.  I'll believe Ice Cube is a great actor when I see him convincingly play a brain surgeon, a priest, or something other than another variation of the same scowling bad ass he played in his debut film, ""Boyz In the Hood"" years ago.  Still when a scowling badass is what you want, this rapper is your man and his persona(he basically plays himself in every movie) serves him well here.As for Natasha Henstridge, no matter what she does she'll probably always be thought of as ""The babe from the `Species' movies.""  But the script smartly plays off her ""hottie"" status, by having her cop deftly fend off sexual advances from both her female commanding officer(Pam Grier) and her fellow officer(Jason Statham).  She's smart as a whip and tough as nails.The supporting cast, is also full of interesting picks, Statham and Clea Duvall are two of my favorite character actors and 70s-film goddess Grier is always fun to watch though I wish she had more to do here.Also worth noting is the action.  It's been years, since Carpenter did a balls-out action film, and it looks like this script really got his juices flowing.  The action scenes here just flat out rock.Lastly, though the film's overall storyline is nothing special or inventive it's biggest asset is that it does succeed in drawing the viewer in.  After watching this movie, I found myself wanting to know more about these characters, about the true nature of the film's ""Martians,"" and about the matriarchal human society that came to rule the red planet.Though the film's dissappointing performance at the box offices puts the prospects of a sequel in doubt, I have to say it would be more than a little interesting to revisit the characters and story elements introduced here.I only saw the film in the theatre so I cannot comment on the DVD release.  However, the extras listed here pretty much guarantees that I will buy it at some point in the near future although I have only one quibble:  Why no Ice Cube commentary?Bottom line though, this movie is really a must for JC fans and anyone who likes the sci-fi action genre. John Carpenter is back and back in fine form.",N/A

She is beautiful, talented, unconventional and luminous in this role of a wandering woman and her daughter who open a chocolate shop in a small, conservative French town just as Lent begins. Binoche slowly wins over the townspeople with her delicious concoctions, but the mayor (Alfred Molina) is unmoved, as is a severe women who works with him (Carrie Anne Moss, virtually unrecognisable from her role as Trinity in The Matrix). Binoche's daughter is charmingly portrayed by young actress Victoire Thivisol, who was first seen as a tiny child in the engaging and sad French film Ponette. Binoche's love interest is played by Johnny Depp, who is summarily shunned by the town. Other fascinating roles, the always superb Judi Dench as the woman who rents the shop to Binoche (and as Moss's estranged mother. Moss will not allow Dench to see her grandson, but Binoche conspires to allow grandmother and grandson to see one another secretly at her shop). Also important here are the roles of the abused wife, Lena Olin (real-life wife of director Lasse Hallstrom) and her husband, played well by Peter Stormare (whom you may remember best as the accomplice to the crime in Fargo.

There are enough melee scenes for any pubescent lad to get his testosterone blazing. Plenty of choreographed fight scenes &amp; clever effects. Stop action animation is better than we saw in 50's B movies. But, an important point was overlooked--everything in the movie is new. Clothes are clean, just off the costumers' sewing machines.Let's not forget the villain, Profien. Not at all convincing, more of a geek. Banal, not convincingly evil.

569960,"I used to go to the theater frequently and one playwright I came to adore was Alan Ayckbourn from the UK. He was to comedic plays what playwrights David Mamet and Sam Shepherd were to dramatic ones. Ayckbourn's gift is to hit dead on the essential underpinnings of the British middle and upper classes and set them up for laughter amidst a rollicking good story line.  I was absolutely astounded to discover how good Helena Bonham-Carter is doing comedic material.  When I first put the disk on the player, hubby saw she was in it and groaned, being convinced she plays nothing other than sullen witches.  He was even more astounded than I was by the utterly transformed Bonham-Carter. The basic premise of the comedy is simple.  Bonham-Carter will get revenge on Neill's competitor who stole his job.  In exchange, Neill will wreck revenge upon the wife of Bonham-Carter's former lover.  This leads to one hilarious scene after another with the high point being a duel in the woods, with shotguns, between Neill and the former lover.  Only Ayckbourn could come up with 2 Brits using shotguns instead of dueling pistols in the name of honor and make it gently humorous instead of outright Monty Python zaney. If you have never seen an Ayckbourn play or film before, you are in for a treat.  Ayckbourn becomes an acquired taste along the way that no other playwright fills quite as well in his little niche British world.",Sweet Revenge

THE movie for anyone who is a film maker, movie buff, or anyone who is just simply a humanitarian.&quot;american movie&quot; is without any doubt a unique and positively brilliant cinematic masterpiece.  the film gives an inside look at not only the process of making an independent movie, but also ,and more importantly, an inside look at the person inside all of us.you care about the people in this film not because they're just cardboard characters, but because they are REAL people. this is truly a very moving and touching, at times even heartwarming, film.i can't really say anything more about this film than i have because its one of those rare movies that you just have to experience for yourself to understand what makes it so special.no offense, but if you're a shallow person, this is not the movie for you, you'd be better off watching &quot;show girls&quot; for the thousandth time.while this is a movie about film making, it is more of a movie about humanity and comradery. this film is anything but superficial, and is one of those rare films that has a true heart beating inside of it.watch it, and enjoy.",N/A

It makes you stop and think about what you do, why you do it, you just think about everything. I do agree that the Green Mile is horrible, and no even comparable to this. I enjoyed Morgan Freeman's nice, pleasurable tone on the narration and I think Tim Robbins plays his part masterfully. It is very well directed and, even though it goes at a very mellow and slow rate, you never get bored. The characters are so interesting that you have to know what happens to them. There are lots of twists and turning points in the story, and the last half hour of this film is the most enjoyable half-hour you'll ever see. Go and rent this movie.

536076,"I went to see this movie with my family and my cousin, and I was utterly surprised, when the movie was over, that everyone in our party loved it!I, personally, totally enjoyed it. I agree that The Silence of the Lambs had much more plot and flowed more smoothly than Hannibal, but you have to admit that this is kind of a fun movie (yes! fun!). There was only one flaw that I thought took away from the movie: Irrelevency. There wasn't anything in it that was completely irrelevent, but the writers came pretty close. When I say it was &quot;irrelevent&quot;, I'm not saying it to convey the thought of the movie being just a time-filler. No. what I mean is that there were a couple of things that happened toward the beginning of the movie that were never brought up again. One: What happened to Barney? Did they get him for selling the goods?The movie's actors were something to brag on! Anthony Hopkins was, as usual, amazing. He played Dr. Lecter/Dr. Fell to a T. He made his character almost &quot;loveable&quot;, which is good and bad at the same time. Good: it makes the movie more fun and suspensful to watch. I don't like watching movies where I HATE the main character. Bad: you find yourself feeling guilty for actually LIKING this evil thing that has no mercy for anyone, except Clarice. Julianne Moore was also VERY GOOD. Only one thing took away from her performance and made me want Jodie Foster back: the accent. In SotL, Foster kept her strong accent throughout the entire movie. In Hannibal, Moore, had it a little sometimes and none at other times. Maybe she shed it, finally...I don't know. You have to admit, though, Moore is one brave lady for attempting to fill Foster's shoes, and she does a great job of it!I didn't find the violence and gore in this movie unbearable. I can think of many movies, along with Made-For-TV-Movies that had more violence and murder than this one. Saving Private Ryan comes to mind first.One last note to those of you who were disgusted at Lecter's affection to Starling and Starling's respect to Lecter...don't read the book. You'll burn it after reading the ending! I loved it, but, then again, I found the bond between the two in the movie impressive.All in all, this movie is one to see.

227301,"This film is a German-French coproduction, so it is interesting as a product of how Americans are viewed by the Europeans.  Every scene seems to contain images of something that is decaying or something that is being built.  Cars are everywhere.  Expansive desert vistas mirror the barrenness of the main character's inner life.  Motion is seen as an antidote to pain.  The final confrontation between Harry Dean Stanton and Nastasia Kinski is very moving, and the plight of Stanton's character at the end of the film is heartbreaking.",N/A
466497,"I haven't as yet seen this DVD (I fully plan to as Jackie Chan dubbed on this release I am told).  The 3 stars are for the movie itself.  It is not the best Jackie Chan Hong Kong movie, the Police Story series and Project A 1 &amp; 2 are much better but is definitely worth a look.  I have seen an old dubbed version (OK) and the Asian DVD release (better).  Before approaching any &quot;old&quot; Jackie Chan film (ie. ones done in Hong Kong before America!) viewers should be aware they are lower budgeted so don't have the capacity for special effects as in US movies.  Also, what a Chinese considers funny might not necessarily be what a westerner thinks is funny!  Keeping this in mind, I really liked this film.  The story is &quot;old&quot; (ie. twins separated at birth and coming together later in life with the expected mix-ups) but with Jackie (twice!) it is a lot of fun.  The last action scene in the car factory shows Jackie's amazing acrobatic and martial arts skills to perfection.  If you are Hong Kong movie buff, there are a lot of cameo appearances by HK actors and directors.  Jackie did not direct this film, so ignore any criticism of bad direction by him!  Most of the films Jackie directed himself are superb action pieces, though the acting is not very good in some.  Jackie is more interested in action than dialogue, though &quot;Accidental Spy&quot;, his latest Asian release, is extremely good in all aspects, both action and action, with a good storyline.

It is like all the people who are obsessed with it are exactly alike. Like there is something at the core of this movie that we all want in our lives, and it speaks to us in many ways.

Except for Fearless Hyena 1, which Jackie directed, he loathed them.  He was under contract to Lo Wei and only broke away when he signed with Golden Harvest and made the breakthrough martial arts film, Young Master.  The Lo Wei films in this collection are very badly done (except for Fearless Hyena and perhaps Half a Loaf of Kung Fu, which was an attempt by Jackie to &quot;break away&quot; from the martial arts mould).

541877,"This film spawned yet another &quot;movie moniker&quot; for me: &quot;Schizophrenic Deja-Vu.&quot;  I can't think of a better description.This is truly an enterprising way to choreograph a film - from the end, BACKWARDS to the beginning!The disjointed way in which it is filmed gives you a pretty good feeling for what Leonard actually experiences as his life.LOTS of plausible motives and suspects are developed throughout the film, so by the end (er, beginning) you STILL can't be sure you have it figured out - and chances are you won't anyway.  It's not exactly a suprise ending, but it wasn't expected either.  Or it was expected along with any of a half dozen OTHER possible endings.You know those &quot;experimental&quot; films where audiences are given a chance to VOTE on where the plot goes, as it actually plays out?  Well, this would be one heck of a good candidate.  The movie could have gone in any of a dozen other directions and been as unique and compelling as ever.The only down side to this was that of all the possible endings I was imagining, the actual ending was rather abrupt and sort of &quot;unfullfilling.&quot;  It was as if the director and screenwriter, having gotten this huge machine rolling downhill, couldn't think of a way to STOP it, so they just let it plow into the brick wall at the bottom.  Perhaps not too bad a solution, though.  Given the complexity of the screenplay, I can't imagine coming up with &quot;the one true ending&quot; that really settled it all.Definately a riveter though.",Memento VHS

Although it is not as slick as most Hollywood productions and many later Asian action flicks, it generates more energy than any film that I have seen for a long time.  That energy does not come from fast cuts, loud music, or any the other standard tricks of the film trade.  It comes from the fast and furious movements of highly trained human bodies.  The actors are the best martial artists that China had to offer at the time and it shows.  This is the real thing.",Shaolin Temple (World Video)

Now that i have the New Line Platnium Edition I can see inside the directors mind and how he made S7ven, what thoughts he had about the characters, the scenes and the story, how he set up the mood. This is all explained in the four commentaries that are included with the disc. On the second disc are supplemental material such as an inside look to the making of John Does books and the making of the title sequence with alternate versions. Also included are Deleted scenes with optional commentary, (mostly just extended takes but still good otherwise). But of course the best thing about it is the movie itself, fully remastered to look and sound just like the director wanted it. This is a must have for everybody.",Seven

It seemed to have the sense of coming from secondhand experience, not from someone who had &quot;been there..&quot;  I found the film life affirming and a gussied up version of what the struggles of addiction and recovery are about, and therefore worthwhile.

207948,The Enterprise Incident in my opinion is one of the top 5 episodes in the original series.  I always like it when the Romulans or Klingons appear in the Star Trek Series be it The Next Generation or Deep Space Nine or Voyager.  But the original series really gets it right when it came to the Romulans (not only this epiode but in the episode &quot;Balance of Terror&quot;). This episode begins with the Enterprise crossing the Neutral Zone which is like the Iron Curtain during the Cold War between the USA and USSR.What the Enterprise is doing in Romulan Territory is anyone's guess until the last 20 minutes or so.  Several twists in the plot occur and it is suspensful from the beginning to the end.The Romulan Commander is played by the beautiful Joanne Linville and she gives an unforgettable performance.Highly recommended to all Star Trek fans!,"Star Trek - The Original Series, Episode 59: The Enterprise Incident VHS"
520991,"Well, when I first said I wanted to see this movie my mom looked it up on Deseret News, and it was a bad review. So from that point on my mom was not for it! When I finally did get to see it I was entertained, and not to mention I could see it again in the same day without getting bored! which means it wasn't a film you could memorize when you see it for the first time. You don't know what's going to happen next, and you can never tell either.  If you've read even a little about the story you'd know that the droid goes mustang, and is after them.  What impressed me was the robot...it looked exactly like a mountain lion, or a puma.  It moved like one, and it even acted like one!  So when that robot goes BAZERK it gave me chills, because I've had mountain lions in my back yard before. Another thing was the plot, it was not what you usually expect from  a Mars film.  Usually you'd find aliens on Mars, either they what to totally exterminate the entire human race, or they are some sort of god-like figure, BUT NOT IN THIS MOVIE!!

For us Hamlet fans, it is painful to see the work crushed into the constraint of a two hour (or less) movie.

397266,"It's too long, too unfocused and way too self-indulgent. But in the end, none of this matters. Sean Penn's second effort as a director-screenwriter is compelling and emotionally resonant ways that more conventionally well-made films never manage to be. Jack Nicholson gives one of his finest performances as Freddy Gale, a jewelry store owner whose  daughter was killed by a drunken driver six years before the story begins. Since then, the devastated Freddy has remained alive only by nursing the hope that he will be able to kill John Booth (David Morse), the man who accidentally killed his daughter. But as the guilt-racked Booth is released from prison, it becomes very clear that perhaps neither man really wants to live much longer. Throughout &quot;Crossing Guard,&quot; Penn has a tendency to sledgehammer his way through walls rather than simply opening doors. Even so, he always gets where he wants to go -- to that dark corner of our hearts where we can forgive no one, not even ourselves. Co-star Anjelica Huston has a couple of terrific scenes as Freddy's ex-wife, a woman with her own share of guilt, fear and loathing.",Crossing Guard VHS

Also, this is the only place to find the MTV-style music videos for &quot;Your Wildest Dreams,&quot; &quot;I Know You're Out There Somewhere,&quot; &quot;No More Lies,&quot; and the 1989-remake of &quot;Question.&quot;  This is the closest that the band will come, I believe, to releasing a music video anthology as well as a documentary.

Much to my delight, the DVD is not the cesspool of quality others have rated it at; it's a good collection of classic Popeye, plain and simple.The quality could be worlds better here and there -- and the original makers of these cartoons could have kept them stored in climate-controlled, air-tight vaults. The thing to remember is a lot of these shorts were made for the simple reason of economics; they were made to make money, not for prosperity. Care of the original film wasn't a priority after it was made.Regardless, this collection is great. It's fun to watch, I'm seeing cartoons I haven't seen in years, and my son loves them.

She is a woman who's been disappointed a time or two and generally expects the worst, and when she doesn't get it, she's surprised.  She is her own worst enemy with a foul mouth and a skanky style and a chip on her shoulder.  She is also very smart and incredibly strong and knows right from wrong (and that's the chip on her other shoulder).  We love her.Stir in Richard Gere or Tom Cruise (no, he's too short)...  How about...no, no, NO.  Give her someone near her equal.  How about a real actor twice her age?  How about Albert Finney (whom I first saw in the delightful Tom Jones (1963))?  Together they play it like Katherine Hepburn and Spencer Tracy without the romance.  Not only does it work, it's a triumph.  Finney really is brilliant.  His timing is exquisite as is his ability to round his character.  Did you catch the shot of him with the one eye comically magnified through his glasses?  For love interest give her a bandana-wearing biker whom she turns into a house husband to take care of her kids while she takes on Pacific Gas and Electric (market cap = $28-billion).  For the first time in her life she is doing something important.  For the first time in her life people respect her.  There's something wonderful about this because even without an education people can see, and she can know, that she's their equal and maybe a bit more.Aaron Eckhart, lately seen as the sociopathic Chad in the startlingly original In the Company of Men (1997) plays the biker house husband with fidelity and a kind of sappy warmth.  She neglects him and her kids for her obsession.  Susannah Grant, who penned the very clever script must have gotten a good laugh with this unusual household, the poor, stay at home neglected husband, the always on the road wife.  Incidentally, don't miss the scene where he first kisses her.  It was so real all I could think was this guy is kissing Julia Roberts!  She is so powerfully expressive that everything she does is real.  That's her gift.A significant part of the success of Erin Brockovich of course is in the compelling (and substantially true) story of David versus Goliath (&quot;and all his relatives,&quot; as Finney quips), of good versus evil, of the &quot;little guy&quot; versus the corporate behemoth.  I won't be giving away anything by telling you that there's a happy ending.  But this is also a triumph for Director Steven Soderbergh who can now add a box office success to critical acclaim.  I haven't seen any of his latest movies,  (I'm looking forward to seeing Traffic), but I recall with pleasure the very interesting Sex, Lies, &amp; Videotape from 1989.  I am also looking forward to the Academy Awards presentations because I suspect the Academy is going to reward both Julia Roberts and Soderbergh by making Erin Brockovich the Best Picture of the year 2000.",Erin Brockovich VHS
2413,"A recent review of James Clavell's 1971 film, &quot;The Last Valley&quot; missed the point completely.  Clavell's choice of Europe in the midst of one of the worst calamities to befall Western Civilization was done because this time and place, along with the Thirty Years War, was the crucible from which the modern world emerged...the modern territorial state, sovereignty, secularism, humanism, etc.  You do not have to look very hard to find references to these issues in the film.  But beyond that, there are universal isssues here.  True, there is a reaction to the war in Vietnam, America's worst foreign policy calamity, as there are numerous reactions to other anxieties of that time, relgion, superstition, inhumanity and humanity, and, of course, war.  A national news magazine, at the time, ran the headline &quot; Is God Dead?&quot;  Richard M. Nixon was forming an &quot;enemies list.&quot;  Revelations of American atrocities in Southeast Asia were coming out.  Of course this was a troubled time.  Michael Caine and Omar Sharif portray composite chararacters...they are both cast in the role of &quot;everyman.&quot;  But each represents different but no less vital parts of humanity...the realist and the idealist...hope and the abandonment of hope.  You must see the film, and then ponder which holds out for mankind.  The film itself is well acted, especially by Caine (note the basis for his character in &quot;The Eagle Has Landed) and Sharif, and directed.  Clavell's script is profound at times.  It is beautifully, and dramtically, photographed.  And it is driven by a musical score that is one of John Barry's best achievements.  The transfer to DVD is not as good as one might have hoped for.  It is in the bargain category, afterall.  It remains visually stunning, and the sound has been preserved quite well, for the most part.

And yes, I do believe a lot of what the movie says (about how products consume us, how we live by what we have) but the most disturbing part is that the characters use VERY poor judgement to let out their anger. This wouldn't be that bad if the film had bombed, but the fact that it got so popular is by far more disturbing than anything this hurls at us. Why there are so many people that think what they did is justifiable is horrible. I'm  not the kind that'll say this such-and-such can effect our lives in evil ways, but yes, this has done that.

67647,"American Beauty, this chilling yet humorous look at the typical American family trapped in the world of suburbia.  The movie is all about appearances, ""In order to be successful one must project an image of success at all times.""  That is probably one of the overall themes of the movie.  Many of the characters find success to be something all their own through validation of themselves or from another, and you see how their belief in that either makes them better or tears them down.  Sam Mendes, the director of this incredible movie was able to select an awesome cast, including Kevin Spacey, Annette Bening, Thora Birch, Allison Janney, Wes Bentley, Mena Suvari and Peter Gallagher, all of whom were able to believably bring their character life through just a look or a line.The fantastic movie and incredible cast should be enough to buy this DVD, but it is also loaded with bonus features.  The commentary is wonderful and informative, really breaking down the shots and informing you on what was cut out.  This definitely shows the insightfulness of the director on making sure that there was no unnecessary dialog that would take away from the moment.  Even the behind the scenes featurette was a pleasure to watch.If you haven't seen this movie yet, it is definitely worth you time.  The acting is superb, the quality is excellent and the features are outstanding.  American Beauty deserved all 5 Academy Awards including best picture, because this is truly ""Spec-tac-ular"".",Belleza Americana American Beauty  VHS
180836,"I'm a big fan of Tarrentino's work, though he gets alot of bad rap I believe him to be one of the most talented writers alive, starting with Resevoir Dogs, he wrote Natural Born Killers, and Four Rooms, Desperado, and finally coming to From Dusk Till Dawn. This movie was a rocker, holding any clues or hints that there would be deradful horror in the last hour. Teaming up with horror man Robert Rodriguez, they put together this very well made horror movie about two criminal crazy boys [George Clooney, Quentin Tarrentino] who are on the run for Mexico, They kidnap a family on road [Harvey Keitel, Juliette Lewis, and the son]and they come to a bar called the T**ty Twisters, they find that the bar is infact an eledged trap for feeding time for the vampires that inhabit it, they have to become a team with their hostages to survive, not to mention a couple other cast members; Fred Williamson, and the Sex Machine. You actually grow to admire the Gecko brothers [Clooney, Tarrentino]and Tarrentino's fine writing, alot of sick and twisted but also real features you'll see, along with bloody vampires nawing on humans, and a sided 4 man battle over a bloody severed body part battle ground, that turns to chaos. The movie was very well put together, starting out with 2 Pulp Fiction guys that run into a bunch of Fright Night vampires, the idea was to act upon the impressionable idea that Stephen King does himself in his novels, that to draw the audience into the story so that they indeed care about the characters and them BAM! vampires come along, you put the characters in this altered world of life and death. This movie is especially good on DVD, the sound is ausome along with the bonus materials, and the wide screen.",N/A
569813,"As long as you overlook the continuity aspects of the Highlander movie franchise, then this movie isn't really that bad. Personally I like all the Highlander movies-- even including Highlander 2 (the Renegade version that is), and the TV series is a classic as well.Now, on to End Game: I thought it was good, but then again I'm a big fan of Highlander... some of my friends, however, really hated the movie-- they aren't fans though. Obviously they either had problems with the continuity or they plain old just don't get Highlander. Overall it was an enjoyable movie for me, and an above average one at that. So, I'd be really happy if Duncan MacLeod appeared in at least one more movie. I think they should have Amanda in it too because they have good chemistry together. And of course don't forget about Joe and Methos. If they do make 1 more movie, then they should at least resolve some of the present issues at hand-- Adrian Paul can't play the Highlander forever and niether can Elizabeth Gracen. Anyways they could always start another TV show. How about a movie that takes place in outer space or something... or how about they discover that immortals are really hybrid aliens or something (which was hinted at in Highlander 2: The Quickening)...Now that Connor is dead (he'll always be THE Highlander to me), they can concentrate on one thing and not both. Hopefully, they (the producers) won't make any more conflicting storylines and characters, it would be nice to have a fresh new immortal created...",N/A

He does a very able job playing Grady Tripp, a creative writing instructor at a college despite his not having produced a second novel after his glittering first novel of seven years ago.  Set over a weekend, this is a comic look at everything that goes comicly wrong in Tripp's (Douglas's) life, from the women in it to the students to his literary agent and beyond.  I LOL when I saw him working on his 2,000 page book manuscript that he typed on a typewriter, for God's sake!  The fate of this manuscript during the course of this movie is pretty comedic in and of itself.  I thoroughly enjoyed this movie and stuck right with it.  However, I notice that a few other Amazon reviewers mention that they thought it was slow.  I didn't have that problem with it but I did notice that hubby dozed off a time or two during it.  This is not gripping, hard hitting material by any means and it is possible that others may find it slow as well.  Nevertheless, it is a good evening's entertainment for you and I recommend it.",N/A
514747,"John Leguizamo is a talented and diverse actor. Mira Sorvino also has a number of roles on her resume that distinguish her as gifted in the diversity department. These roles in Summer of Sam are not particularly flattering of their skills, nor is the script particularly well written. The script jumps around quite a bit, trying to illustrate the lives of several characters during this period of ""terror"" in New York, when a crazed, maniacal killer was running through the city murdering dark haired women. There is too much of the debauchery of the day emphasised-the drugging, the clubbing, the sex party orgies, and Leguizamo's character's complete inability to be faithful to his wife, played by Sorvino. Leguizamo is having an affair with his boss (Bebe Neuwirth) and just about all his clients (he is a hairdresser). And basically any other woman he meets. And yet he cannot seem to perform with his wife. The fact that we know all these things about him really does not lend credibility to the film . We know far more about his sexual proclivities than we know about anything else in this film. In fact it is never quite clear what we are supposed to be getting from this film.

However, in one part of the movie, when the brothers go over to Thelma Todd's house, the film in various points jumps ahead. For instance when Groucho and Zeppo are going to leave Todd's house (Groucho stays), Groucho kicks Zeppo, than the next frame Groucho runs to the window.

534750,"A Fed-Ex workaholic, recently engaged, is the sole survivor of a plane crash and survives on an uninhabited island for four years. This movie, like almost all of today's films, was poorly sold. In the space of a sixty second commercial, not only did they tell you all of the above info-admittedly this is a simple story-they also took out all of the suspense of the movie by spilling the beans about the 3rd Act and the fact that he gets rescued. All that's left to discover is the last 20 minutes. We don't know much about Hanks' character beside the fact that he's a workaholic, and that his life is dictated by the Clock. And this is where the film falls short. By not knowing what kind of man this is, or even what he thinks he is, there is nothing to discover about his transformation,of which there is very little, other than the physical. Sure there is the isolation and the depression to witness and the creation of fire and the finding of food and shelter, but there is a larger protrait missing here. It's the difference between a good film and a great film. Hanks is very, very good here, but without a truely full dimensional character to play, it's Hanks we see on the island, not Chuck Noland. Noland is more of a statistic than a character. An actress of Helen Hunt's stature, and talent, is badly needed because we can plug in bits of her other characterizations into the story to keep her presence alive. Robert Zmeckis is a good director for entertainment films, and he's got taste and class, but this film needed an artist, which Zmeckis is not. And like his other big film FORREST GUMP, you're not sure what,if anything, he's trying to say. Zmeckis is a very external director, so it's no wonder many, many people didn't get the last scene of this film. It feels like a different, and more talented director helmed this scene. It's completely at odds stylistically with the rest of the film. Like the director started using a different film language, is the best way I can explain it.No wonder many people didn't get it. It's more in the style of older foreign language films. I think it's the best scene in the film, and I wish Zmeckis had started filming this movie after shooting this scene instead of the other way 'round....As for the DVD, the DTS sound is superb and the extras at times, do a better job of defining the movie's intentions, than the film itself.",N/A
478817,"I really like this movie, and I like it even more now because of Anchor Bay's excellent work on its restoration. The picture is absolutely stunning. I won't go too much into why I like the movie, rather I'll talk about its faults. There are quite a few. Let's take the color of the blood, so crucial to the proceedings. -It unfortunately look more like paint, than real blood. Real blood is much more dark. Never mind. Then there's the Italian policeman, or rather his Italian voice. Awful !. I know they're used to dubbing in Italy, even bad dubbing, but this guy is ridiculous. -Did he think he was working on a comedy ?. Surely Argento could've stopped him. Maybe Dario thought it was funny ?. Who knows. Not too much make sense in this movie. -Like Hemmings' piano-playing character deciding to investigate on his own. And in a perfect world the DVD-people would also have gotten hold of Hemmings again, to re-voice his character's non-English scenes. But you can't have everything, of course. For some reason the most irritating event in the movie, as far as I'm concerned, is the old housekeeper who works for one of the victims. -Her employer has just been violently murdered, and she just goes about her daily business cleaning up the mess like it's the most normal thing in the world !. Mad as a hatter !. I swear I almost heard her whistle. But there are many incomprehensible, almost dream-like and surreal sequences like that. No, I don't know what the walking doll means either, but it's a nice touch. I don't mind long movies, but this one drags a bit and some of the scenes we could do without. In fact, I'm pretty sure Argento would've left the silly arm-wrestling sequence out today. -That scene just goes on and on, and they're not talking about anything important. I think Argento prefers this movie to, say, &quot;Cat O' Nine Tails&quot; which also was a long movie, but nothing was wasteful in that one. I actually think &quot;Cat...&quot; is a much better film than &quot;Deep Red&quot;. -All the scenes in &quot;Cat...&quot; needed to be there, unlike many in &quot;Deep Red&quot;. In retrospect, the restoration of &quot;Deep Red&quot;, as commendable as it is, seems a bit like a case of &quot;it was possible, so we did it&quot;, but it wasn't really necessary. The film is a welcome, but strange curio now. My favorite sequences in &quot;Deep Red&quot; are the snake-like p.o.v. shots of different objects, the hallway of paintings, and Hemmings two visits to the empty villa. Lovers of (arty) '70s thrillers can't go wrong with this movie.",Deep Red VHS
310242,"First came Goldfinger, then Diamonds Are Forever.  These are the two greatest Bond movies with Connery in the title role.  Both have great villians, and to be a great Bond movie, there must be a great villian.  Connery has never been more comfortable in the role of Bond.  He shows it all in this movie:  charm, wit, luck, indifference to authority, grace under pressure, worldliness, weariness, and humility.  Is this not one of the most fascinating characters ever portrayed on film?  I've seen every Bond film again and again.  Connery is the best Bond, because the more you think you understand about Bond, the more you feel that there is still more to know.  None of the Bond actors communicates this better than Connery.  It is what gives Bond his unpredictability, and makes you feel that you can't take your eyes off him even for a moment, because of what he might do to surprise you.  If I could own only three Bond films with Connery in the lead role, then From Russia With Love, Goldfinger, and this one, would pretty well sum up the whole series.  The rest are highly repetitive fair to poor copies.",N/A
262036,"&quot;Nightbreed&quot;, based on the book &quot;Cabal&quot; by Clive Barker.Directing from a screenplay of his own novel, Barker's film is unfortunately inconsistent in both style and tone, and the plot meanders somewhat inconsequentially. Also lacking are the more homoerotic undertones of the novel, although a certain amount remains between Craig Scheffer's Boone and the decidedly sexually-appealing monster Peloquin (played by actor/director Oliver Parker).Boone is plagued by memories of a place he has never seen, with his visions twisted by psychotic psychologist Decker, played by David Cronenberg. Boone seeks out this place and eventually finds himself in Midian, which we discover is 'where the monsters' go. What is interesting about Barker's film is the perspective taken here; the film attempts to lay our sympathy with the creatures who are persecuted and slaughtered by the redneck police force, and does so with some success. Despite its major flaws, Nightbreed does succeed in eliciting a strong degree of emotion for the monsters, no doubt inspired by Barker's own homosexuality; while the direction is messy and the production design glaringly inconsistent throughout, the film does at least compensate for these flaws in its humanity.",N/A
531511,"One does try as hard as one can to avoid the working classes, although poverty and lack of transport make this problematic.  If curiosity about how they actually live their lives gets the better of one then what safer way than home video?  My last such glimpse into a strange and unfamiliar world was through Ken Loach's 'Kes', in which a frustrated and alienated young boy, cowed by an aggressive brother and the uncertainty of a benighted future down the pits, discovers that his best friend is a Kestrel.  Quickly crushing any aesthesia brought on by Loach's compassion for the great unwashed, it has taken the hyperbol surrounding 'Billy Elliot' to take me less than expeditiously down memory lane once more.  How have the lives of the working classes changed thirty years on?  Apparently they sleep two to a bedroom instead of six as I had once erroneously supposed and have inside toilets.  When a solitary worker has the temerity to want to do a day's work he is chased through a succession of working class dwellings by fifty riot police in full regalia until caught.  It's gratifying to see such a realistic prioritizing of police resources on film and the comforting knowledge of the tax payer's money well spent.  Apart from that, little has changed except for one egrigious detail.  Your actual working classes pirouette down the high street. Billy Elliot, a frustrated and alienated young boy cowed by an aggressive brother and the uncertainty of a benighted future down the pits, discovers that his best friend is a ballet tutu.  Also, his second best friend just might be a transvestite.  This irresponsibility on the part of the British film industry should not go unanswered.  This is not Hampstead.  Encouraging the lower orders to experience culture only leads to books, and books lead to union membership and then (God help us) secret ballots. I think the need to appeal to the American market has reared it's capitulant head here.  Pleas for sexual tolerance and finding your inner child are more important than a roof over one's head and the dignity of (hard) labour.  Kestrels are aggressive, macho symbols that may lower the tone and pull a boy's false eye lashes off.  Of course, we must take all these changes on trust, but how accurate is this to real working class lives?  Unlike the ending to 'Kes' which leaves the audience basking in the warm glow of their own undoubtedly justified prejudices, 'Billy Elliot' leaves us suspicious and distrustful at it's challenge to the natural order.  Yes, we may let the odd one escape to become rock musicians, sportsman and soap stars, but let us not get carried away.  This is an American fortune cookie, not OUR Britain, thank you very much.Now, one may be prepared to sit through working class life when the film making calibre of Ken Loach is involved, but when confronted by the almost obdurately dire artistic decisions and cack direction of Stephen Daldry, the urge to hit the off switch is overwhelming.  There are, no doubt, worse experiences one might be subjected to in one's drawing room than 'Billy Elliot' such as listening to pibroch while having your leg chewed off by a shark, but it's a close run thing.  It may be in the unlikely event prejudice (heaven forbid), but I thought this film was quite staggeringly, fall off Ben Nevis bad.  It's jocund liveliness cannot hide it's jejunity (and trying saying that fast, I guarantee it will be more comprehensible than 'Billy Elliot'). And if I have to endure one more scene in which a minor turns to another minor (as opposed to a miner) and after a long pause says &quot;do you want to play hide the salami with me&quot; or words to that effect, I shall emigrate to Botswana and I don't even know where that is.  Do contemporary writers think this is cute and cuddly coming from children, as opposed to deeply creepy put in their mouths by an adult?  May I suggest that in an act of charity not dissimilar to their salt of the earth goodness depicted in 'Billy Elliot', our actual working classes band together to confer on the writer Mr Hall, the useful and life changing gift of an escritoire?",N/A

Also included is a photo stills gallery of collector Wes Shank's Blob collection, including the famous red silicone masquerading as a man-eating monster from outer space.For casual fans of the film, however, this version (from Beverly Wilshire Filmworks, distributed by Front Row Video) is serviceable enough with VHS-like viewing quality.

The script is very witty, even to the point of being really good, but the developement of its characters is sadly lacking. Heath Ledger's character, Patrick Verona (the male lead), goes too easily from &quot;tough and scary&quot; to &quot;sweet and sensitive&quot;, without anything to make us believe it. Since the dialogue shows no evidence of his being in love with Kat (Julia Stiles) until he comes out and says it, it's rather hard to believe. Juliat Stiles character has a similiar problem, going from &quot;grumpy loner&quot; to &quot;happy teen&quot; in hardly a blink. Of course, one hardly notices due to these young actors supurb preformances.The co-stars steal the show, however. The bumbling new kid who falls for the sweet and popular, if a little shallow, Bianca (Kat's sister) is so likable I wish the story focused on him and all his troubles, and his quirky new friend has some great lines.

530958,"I recently wrote a review for &quot;Blow&quot; comparing it to &quot;Traffic&quot; (which I thought was overhyped and overrated).  It's easy for me to lump all these movies together because of they all share the same theme: drugs.  Let me be blunt, comparing those other two movies (even Blow which I enjoyed) to Requiem is like comparing &quot;Bill and Ted's Excellent Adventure&quot; to &quot;Citizen Kane&quot;.  No contest.If you're already on edge worrying about current events and world conditions STAY AWAY FROM THIS FLICK.  It might be enough to drive you right over the edge.  It's like an anxiety attack in a bottle.  It's so real and so intense that for me, I had to keep reminding myself it was just a movie, which is something I rarely have to do.  If you've ever had a family member who's battled a drug habit, or had a drug habit yourself, this flick will stand your hairs on end.  All the mania and euphoria of drugs is shrouded by a sense of loss and disappointment that almost always comes to those who clean up, or lose their personal battles.No doubt it's director Darren Aronofsky's deranged camera angles and constant bombardment of imagery that contribute most to the film's power and intensity.  It has all the subtlety of a gamg of thugs armed with chains and clubs beating you senseless without ever allowing you a moment to catch your breath.  Even the quiet moments are filled with so much heartbreaking tragedy that the viewer is allowed no reprieve.Incredible performances all four main players.  Ellen Burstyn deserves every kind of award that an actress can get, but it was Marlon Wayans performance that kept me in awe because it was just so unexpected.  Wayans shows that he has the talent and the skill to be a true heavy weight.  The interaction between Jared Leto and the always underrated Jennifer Connelly was what I found most disturbing about the flick.  Watching their relationship disintegrate is just too convincing and genuine at times.So to sum up... I'm not sure how to sum this movie up.  It's not for the faint of heart.  It is for anyone who's sick of the mediocre b.s. that hollywood has been pumping down our throats.  A movie like this comes out every once and awhile and makes you remember why you watch movies.

It was obvious right from the beginning that these were people we were going to like and watch for years. It was also obvious that these actors were a strong bunch of people with instant charm and chemistry. This two volume collection contains some great episodes. You get the Pilot episode which, if you haven't seen lately, is a real hoot to see them looking so different. You get hilarious episodes like &quot;The One Where No One's Ready&quot;, which is kind of seinfeldian in a way. But, the top episodes is &quot;The One With The Prom Video&quot;. A classic!.

468763,"David Cronenberg is a very sick man. Everytime I tape another one of his movies &amp; sit down to watch it, I wonder about an industry that would continue to give this man money with which to record his personal obsessions. Of course, the fact that I find it necessary to tape &amp; watch the films provides the answer!&quot;eXistenZ&quot; is, in a nutshell, Cronenberg's return to the themes of his first film &quot;Videodrome&quot;. Since &quot;Videodrome&quot; was produced at the dawn of the cable era, it used the video aspect of modern society to make its' points. Now that computer gaming is so much a part of modern society, Cronenberg has found an even more potent tool for his surgical dissections of mass media.To viewers who haven't seen this earlier work, Cronenberg's repeated use of &quot;bioports&quot;, &quot;gamepods&quot; &amp; other artifacts of mutant genentech may seem ripped out of William Gibson's later works. However, &quot;Videodrome&quot; presented us with repellent representations of man merging with plastic way back in the late 70's (well before Gibson was a household name). The vision however has grown much darker. We've watched the progression thru the intermediate works of &quot;Dead Ringers&quot;, &quot;the Krays&quot; &amp; &quot;Naked Lunch&quot; but &quot;eXistenZ&quot; is so dark as to be almost unwatchable at times.I realize I am completely ignoring any plot synopses, but you can read other reviews for that. I will mention that Jennifer Jason Leigh does excellent work as the &quot;demoness Allegra Geller&quot; &amp; Jude Law does an excellent &quot;PR nerd&quot; keeping an American accent credibly thruout.Will you enjoy &quot;eXistenZ&quot;? That depends on your gross-out factor. If you enjoy watching amorphous pulsating blobs slithering into apertures in people's spinal columns, the answer is a resounding YES. For the rest of us, the answer is a little more ambivalent. The issues dealt with are important &amp; thought- provoking. It is the manner in which Cronenberg chooses to present them that makes me state he is a very sick man!",Existenz VHS
547983,"What you might expect to find on Volume 1 of ""The Twilight Zone"" DVD series would be the pilot episode, but that proves not to be the case. What you will find are a trio of classic episodes where the performances by the actors are as memorable as the stories with their infamous ""Twilight Zone"" twists that characterized Rod Serling's celebrated television anthology series:Episode 51, ""The Invaders"" (Written by Richard Matheson, First aired January 27,1 961) offers a tour de force performance by Agnes Moorhead, long after she appeared in ""Citizen Kane"" and ""The Magnificent Ambersons"" for Orson Welles, and shortly before she became Endora on ""Bewitched."" Moorhead plays a woman living alone in a farmhouse who finds that a miniature flying saucer has landed on her roof. The woman has to fight against the strange tiny invaders with their advanced technology. But then remember, this is ""The Twilight Zone.""Episode 47, ""Night of the Meek"" (Written by Rod Serling, First aired December 23, 1960) is the only Christmas episode in the original run of ""The Twilight Zone."" Poor Henry Corwin (Art Carney), a department store Santa, shows up drunk on Christmas Eve and is fired. Wandering the streets, he discovers a magic bag that can dispense any gift he asks for. The question is, what will Henry do with this most unusual bag? If you are a fan of the ""Zone"" then you have probably heard the legend that Serling wrote the episode just to see Art Carney play Santa Claus. The excellent support casts features two of the best character actors of all time with John Fielder as Henry's short-tempered boss and Burt Mustin as a friendly bum on the streets, but this is Art Carney's triumph. The episode was one of six shot during the second season on videotape instead of film, but that is a minor complaint because it just makes ""Night of the Meek"" seem like a live television broadcast from the 1950s.Episode 81, ""Nothing in the Dark"" (Written by George Clayton Johnson, First aired January 5, 1962) offers veteran character actress Gladys Cooper as Wanda Dunn, an old woman who has barricaded herself in her basement apartment for years, fearing that Mr. Death with kill her with a touch. Wanda knows that Death can take many disguises. But despite her fears, when Harold Beldon, a young policeman is shot outside her door, she drags him inside. Of course, the fact Beldon is played by Robert Redford might have something to do with her letting her guard down. A nice little grace note from the ""Zone.""his DVD includes ""Inside The Twilight Zone"", with information on Rod Serling, a history of the series, reviews of each episode, cast information and a season-by-season commentary. Not a bad first disc, but there is much better to come (Volume 2 is the best in the series). However, you will not find a better trio of performances than you find here with Moorhead, Carney and Cooper.  Plus that Redford fellow is not bad looking.  Whatever happened to him?",N/A

583695,"As if we didn't have enough ghostly little tales in the past few years (The Sixth Sense, Stir Of Echoes, etc.), another comes down the pike with an interesting twist - the main character doesn't see ghosts, but she definitely knows when people are going to die.  The idea for the story supposedly based upon the psychic abilities of Virginia Faulkner Thornton (Billy Bob Thornton's mother - she predicted his Oscar win), ""The Gift"" is a trim little package of murder, trepidation and the supernatural, peppered with an all-star cast and crew of Oscar winners (Swank, Thornton) and nominees (Blanchett, Kinnear, Harris).Annie Wilson (Blanchett) is a humble mother of three quietly making a living in fictional Brixton, GA off of social security from her husband's death and performing psychic readings for the townspeople.  Her recitations consist of one burning taper and a bizarre deck of cards with various symbols (star, circle, wavy lines, etc.) printed on them.  Her abilities as a clairvoyant are honest and true but (wouldn't you know it) Brixton is a backwoods community full of conservatives, skeptics and zealous Christians that believe the reserved widow is a practicing witch.  One man in particular named Donnie Barksdale (Reeves) harbors a special hatred for Annie because his battered wife Valerie (Swank) has been visiting the psychic's home on a regular basis to receive readings.  Donnie harasses Annie, making direct threats to her and her sons and even breaking into her home to creatively render the word ""Satan"" with her cosmic deck.  When Jessica King, the aristocratic daughter (Holmes) of a Brixton bigwig, turns up missing Annie has a vision that will help the BPD locate her.  She is at first snubbed by the chief of police for her marked reputation but when authorities finally take a chance on her, Jessica's body is found on Donnie Barksdale's property and he is immediately taken into custody for her murder. There's a bigger game afoot however, and Annie must single-handedly solve the mystery before the killer attempts to silence her permanently.Blanchett does her best to look simultaneously frightened and determined as Annie, a woman who is against all odds.  We already have proof of her abilities as a dramatic actress (Elizabeth, Paradise Road) and she is not disappointing here, sporting a decent Georgian accent and making her character human despite her inhuman abilities.  Holmes looks too young for her role and it's hard to fathom the chemistry between the 22-year-old actress and her 38-year-old co-star Kinnear (my husband even remarked that she looked like a teenager wearing her mother's clothes).  It's even more weird to see her sexing up ""Office Space"" yeeah-guy Gary Cole (who is 45) in a scene involving bathroom whoopie.  I guess it's just another case of casting directors pitting a beautiful ing&eacute;nue with a handsome fogey twice their age (a la Richard Gere/Winona Ryder, Bo Derek/Dudley Moore, etc.).  Kinnear does an admirable job as Wayne Collins, but a project like this is too simple an undertaking for his acting skills; most likely it was a labor of love for him.  Reeves actually manages to himself seem intimidating as Donnie Barksdale and Swank plays another dimwitted southerner minus the sexual identity crisis.  Oscar nominee Rosemary Harris makes a brief appearance as Blanchett's intuitive grandmother.  Ribisi is the standout here as the erratic Buddy Cole, a man who is consistently on the precipice of a psychological meltdown.  He is a blubbering, tearful mess one minute, hot-blooded and precarious the next.  What is really compelling about Ribisi's performance is the inner turmoil divulged in his roan and expressive eyes.  We know all we need to know about his character's struggle to stay sane simply by surveying his face.  Not a lot of actors have the ability to embody their characters in this way and Ribisi is to be commended for making Buddy a dynamic and remarkable individual.  Although he has yet to get the Academy's attention, the future looks incredibly bright for him and it's almost certain that he will become a hot commodity in the next few years.""The Gift"" delivers most of what it promises but sci-fi/horror fans will most likely be disappointed by its artsy approach (compliments of director Sam Raimi), its failure to scare the bejesus out of them (The Gift has MINOR scares) and its sad predictability.  The story manages to point an accusing finger at everyone but about halfway through (or even sooner) it's easy to identify the culprit.  If you're looking for a semi-suspenseful flick with a distinct and talented cast, ""The Gift"" is an ideal and enjoyable rent.",N/A

We get a lot of great seasoned performers : Piper Laurie, Robert Patrick, Salma Hayek, Jon Stewart, Bebe Neuwirth, Famke Jenssen, and Christopher MacDonald. The kids are all good.

661393,"I'll admit from the start; I'm kind of a sucker for hype.  When I hear so many positive things about a new anime, and I read all the great things critics and magazines have to say about it before it comes out, I get excited.  And once in a good while, as soon as I see it at my local video store, I'll snatch it off the shelf without a second thought.  This was one of those cases.  And for once, I didn't regret it.  ""Blood"" is spectacular, and on just about every level.  The story, basically about a mysterious young girl who hunts shape-shifting vampires (I know, you've heard this before somewhere...), goes into just enough detail to set the tone but leaves the viewer hungry (or is it...thirsty?) for more by the end.  The setting, at Yokota Air Force Base in Japan during the Vietnam war, is dead-on accurate; the buildings, the runway, especially the aircraft, are in immaculate detail.  Even the airmen's uniforms match the time period!  My hat is off to the background and storyboard teams.  I've never seen backgrounds and surroundings look so realistic in an animated film!  Speaking of animation, it just doesn't get much better.  The animators created an unrivaled blend of 2D and 3D CGI.  I've seen such a blend in other anime, but it's difficult to put the two together and make it look natural.  This piece of work, though, is flawless.  The 2D characters flow perfectly into the backgrounds and CGI surroundings, as if they actually belong there.  Being a horror flick, the use of color was a perfect match for the gloomy setting; lots of good use of shadow, dark colors, and tones.  The soundtrack fits like a glove, too; the orchestrated music set the moods of the scenes and just amplified their intensity.  ""Blood"" is, in my opinion, pound for pound one of the best anime out there right now.  Folks, this is pretty much the future of anime.  I highly recommend you grab a piece of it and see it for yourself.  As far as the DVD features go, there's a photo gallery (which is kind of lame) and some previews of other Manga titles.  The best extra by far, though, is the ""making of"" featurette.  It reveals just how much time, effort, and talent went into this little morsel.  I tell you true, the only problem I have with this DVD is that the way the story ended, we're going to have to wait for ""Blood: Part 2"".

Another Best Picture Oscar-winner has allowed me to shed my tears freely and openly.Based on the novel by Larry McMurtry (Lonesome Dove, The Last Picture Show), TERMS OF ENDEARMENT is a &quot;family&quot; film that deals with a 30-year relationship between a flighty mother and her headstrong daughter, played to perfection by Shirley MacLaine as Aurora Greenway, and Debra Winger as her daughter Emma Horton. The film begins by establishing the relatonship between the neurotic Aurora with her young daughter.It makes you laugh and it makes you cry! Either way, the film deserves its kudos. Created by future SIMPSONS producer James L.

You have to be patient considering that the final climax, in which Emma loses her fight with cancer, is the blow that sent me (and possibly millions of other viewers) into tears. Watch Aurora's face; watch Emma's, and you'll know exactly what they're saying without them even saying a word.

Outlaw Star is a well-done, if not thoroughly original, science fiction/action show.

With an intriguing story that pulled the audience in week after week, it was considered one of the most innovative show of its time, and it still is.The pilot presents the genesis of the show, having Sam, the main character, forgetting (almost) completely who he is, where and when he's from and how he got in into the 1950's.  The only thing he does know is that he does not belong where he is.  During the show, Sam gradually learns more about himself and the project he was working on.Quote from Sam, as he realize his predicament: &quot;Okay, it's not a dream.  It's a nightmare.  And if it's a nightmare, then sooner or later, there's going to be a Boogeyman!&quot;  Then enter the Boogeyman, or Albert (&quot;Al&quot;), the observer from his own time...What is remarkable about this television series is that the emphasis is on the personal and social interactions between Sam, Al, and the people around them, not on the science-fiction element of the show.  No techno-babble.  Not many special effects.  Also, the chemistry between Scott Bakula and Dean Stockwell is something to be seen.Sam is presented as quite vulnerable, not the typical lone hero with an attitude.  Sam is acted as an ordinary man (relatively speaking, as Sam has six doctorates) stuck in an extraordinary situation.  Al is the sidekick, and comic relief of the show.The pilot actually presents two &quot;leaps&quot;: one into a test pilot, the other, shorter, into a baseball player.  I do not want to spoil too much the ending, but this episode does end with the typical cliffhanger, leaping into another person, in another time, and into an awkward situation...The DVD itself is plain vanilla.

Tawny Madison&quot; by Gwen DeMarco (Sigourney Weaver), &quot;Dr. Lazarus&quot; by Alexander Dane (Alan Rickman), &quot;Tech Sergeant Chen&quot; by Fred Kwan (Tony Shalhoub), and &quot;Lieutenant Trek Laredo&quot; by Tommy Webber (Daryl Mitchell). But after four years, the show was cancelled, leaving the actors and actresses without any jobs. Twenty years later, at a convention center, they meet up with aliens Commander Mathesar (Enrico Colantoni), Teb (Jed Rees), Quellek (Patrick Breen), and Laliari (Missi Pyle). They are from the alien race Thermians (or Termites! (you'll have to watch the movie to understand!)) and having mistaken the Galaxy Quest TV show for 'historical documents', they request the 'crew' to help them negotiate the terms with the evil Sarris (Robin Sachs). But of course, things don't go they way they seem since the actors are now playing for their lives! And with the help of Guy Fleegman (Sam Rockwell), if you could call him 'help', and Galaxy Quest fan Brandon (Justin Long), they set out to save the universe.Witty and funny, this movie will keep you in stiches throughout the whole 1 hour and 42 minutes of it! Acting is marvelous with Tim Allen as the 'raving ego-maniac', Sigourney Weaver as the beautiful Gwen (watching her you won't be able to believe that she's in her 50's!!), and Alan Rickman as the serious English actor.Though there's nothing bad about this movie, there are some innuendos and some bad language henceforth the PG rating.

It may not be on par with the remake of &quot;Planet of the Apes&quot; (also by Baker), but just watch the Japanese movie &quot;King Kong Vs. Godzilla&quot; to see how GOOD Baker's design really is.It is an interesting 70's time capsule, with Lange's Marilyn Monroe-esque acting, Jeff Bridge's hippie hair-do and &quot;Greenpeace&quot; attitude, and Charles Grodin's oil-obsessed hysteria. Remember the gas lines of the mid-70's? This movie will remind you.Some of the special effects are dated by today's terms, but that's okay. Enjoy the 1976 version of &quot;King Kong&quot; on its own merits: just inoffensive good fun. After all, where else can you see King Kong blow the wet Jessica Lange dry? With puffy cheeks, no less?",N/A
469039,"Underrated, this is a hardcore, dark, macabre masterpiece. Guy Pearce (Captain John Boyd) is a soldier, who, though decorated, is actually a coward. After faking death in a battle against Mexicans, he is tossed among the dead in the enemy's encampment. He crawls out from a beneath a pile of oozing bodies and successfully takes the base from the enemy. His commander knows he isn't a real soldier and so, as he is disgusted by the sight of him but for politics sake can't reprimand him, the captain is sent to an isolated military outpost called Fort Spencer. Living there is a skeleton crew assisted by several indians and everything goes fine until a near dead man(Robert Carlyle) staggers into camp during the middle of a very cold winter. After being warmed up and fed, he tells a grisly tale of desperate cannibalism as he and the party he was traveling with got punished by the elements and were forced into a cave. A select small band soldiers and one indian set out to assist the remaining people in the cave, who by chance might just still be alive and so the movie truly begins. Nothing is quite what it seems as the twists and turns reveal the terrifying realities of the plot which eventually climax in a very satisfying and unexpected ending. The acting is excellent all around but especially with Guy Pearce and Robert Carlyle. The weak nature and mental struggles of Guy Pearce are incredibly believable and completely balance the innocent appearance yet sinister nature of Robert Carlyle. The cinematography creates a creepy, desolate atmosphere as the ingenious soundtrack(as good or better than that of Suspiria) by Damon Albarn and Michael Nyman truly fits ever scene and action, allowing for a true horror experience to be felt. With moments of twisted humor tastefully spread throughout, this is the total horror package and definitely not a movie to be rented...it should be purchased.",N/A

552864,"The movie tells that a blind child Mohammed came to his village with his reluctant father from the school in Tehran. There he lived with his grandmother, his father and his two sisters. His father wanted to remarry and was worried by the fact that he had a blind son. He wanted to send Mohammed to a blind carpenter as a apprentice. But the kind grandmother rejected that. When one day his father took Mohammed away to the carpenter, his grandmother grieved and passed away soon. The fiancee's family rejected the marriage because they saw the death as an ominous sign for the marriage. When the father brought Mohammed back in a rainy day, Mohammed slipped into the flooding brook and flowed away. His father jumped into the brook and pursuit him. Eventually he found Mohammed's body and held it in deep sorrow.The movie is so beautifully shot. The cinematography is superb. A few scenes are breathtakingly stunning:1. When the grandmother knew that his son had taken his grandson away, she stood desolately in sadness. The snowwhite chicken feathers were whirling lightly aournd her and the movie turned into silence. Without a single word, the love of the grandmother to her grandson was brilliantly presented.2.When the grandmother passed away, the old lady was like a goddess as the camera closed to her serene face. The screen lightened up and very tender music raised after a while of complete silence. I could hardly believe she had passed away although I knew she actually had. Purely poetical!3. At the end of the movie, when Mohammed was flooded away, I was extremely sad and felt helpless. His father eventually found his body. He held the body and wept deeply. the camera lingered at the hand of the boy. The fingers moved, the screen was brightened up. At that moment I was totally mesmerized and felt no more sadness. The movie beautifully ended there, as I was left utterly speechless.One of the disgusting things about a lot of these days' movies is pretension and affectation--corny love must be accompanied by grandiose soundtrack and our feelings towards the movies are therefore misled and become untrue. In contrast, a lot of Iranian movies have very little musical score, touching the souls purely by acting and photography. The color of paradise, instead using bunch of music, use elements of true lives, such as the sound of woodpeckers, which makes the movie uncommonly refreshing.Believe me to watch the color of paradise, to experience the genuine soul-touching movie making!",The Color of Paradise
37168,"First of all I have to say that &quot;dog park&quot; is one of a kind when it comes to brig cute dogs to the screen, but on the other hand, the film has nothing new about relationships and love affairs.&quot;Dog...&quot; is about a man (Luke Wilson), whose beloved ex-girlfriend has given him over and taken the dog as souvenir. He meets a woman (Natasha Henstrige), and falls for her, but she is not very interested in having a love affair right now -- at least with him. And this is the way the movies goes... Nothing new or exciting -- apart from the dogs that could have had a much bigger part in this misguided flick.They are the stars and steal any scene they are in (Not that would have been a very difficult task due to the cast they acted with, but anyway they do steal). The pets are treatead as it they were a kid, so they go to 'school', go to a shrink and family sessions... and get graduated. But the human beings also wanted to have a part in the story and this is when the movie becomes a whole mess.Luke Wilson plays his usual role: the nice, a bit silly and single guy. Natasha Henstrige tries hard but can't avoid her femme fatale look. She palys a Mrs booksworm in a TV show, but she does not look like the kind of girl we expect to be reading for our children. Plus, they have no chermistry together, you don't give a damn if they'll get married or kill each other.Many directors have tried to copycat Altman, putting some characters together in a web that is revealed little by little. Some have succed, but many have failed. This film belongs to the second option. If this strategy is not well done, it looks like the characters of the movie are the only human beings on earth, and not that casuallity put them together.To sum up, if you really really really like dogs, watch this film but fastfoward the scenes which they are not in. And my two stars go, of course, to the canines!",N/A

118785,"Kubrick's last film is an existential tour de force.  It is a fascinating exploration into the sexual mores of modern man, handled with a masterful melding of subject matter and style that is typical of Kubrick.  Nudity is plentiful, but there is hardly any overt sex, for one of the movie's themes is REPRESSION.  The duality of human nature (recalling the line in FULL METAL JACKET) is once again the driving force of the plot: love/hate, honesty/deceit, reality/fantasy, freedom/repression, etc.  Kitman's performance is great.  Cruise's is alright.  Kubrick, well, is Kubrick.This DVD is the R-rated version, and so is the remastered DVD edition to be released this June.

The combinaton of high camp, low budget, charismatic actors in over the top farcical roles, the slice of 1970s stereotype, all add up to terrific entertainment. what I was really surprised at watching Across 110th Street is that cheap (and plentiful) gore notwithstanding this film is a work of art. Sure blaxploitation stallwarts like Antonio Fargas and Yaphet Koto are here. Sure there are cartoonishly racist white cops, racist Italian mobsters, parasitically pimpin' black criminals, longsuffering and abused black women, just like most of these flicks. But there is also a real sense of drama here. The timing and camera work, the characterization and detail, are all a step above the standard. The acting is generally witty and convincing. Makes me wish I knew more about this film and where it fit in the development of the genre.It gets only 4 stars because the DVD lacks special features. A commentary track would have been great.",N/A
455847,"Clever dialogue, reality-tinged relationships, and the slow-moving hands of fate converge in this overlooked indie film. Hope Davis gives an understated and convincing performance as Erin, a nurse (med school dropout) whose long-time live-in radical activist boyfriend (a brilliant Philip Seymour Hoffman) leaves her in the first moments of the movie. She seems to enjoy her single life, but her mother (Holland Taylor) doesn't think single life is healthy and places a personal ad on Erin's behalf. Meanwhile, a parallel story ensues about a man, presumably with some shady/underworld connections, leaving the plumbing industry to pursue his dream of becoming a marine biologist. Throughout the movie, this man's path crosses Erin's path, but they never meet. When Erin decides to check her personal ad mailbox, she finds that she has received an overwhelming response and decides to go on several dates (this is a fascinating part of the film), including a date with the plumber-turned-biologist's brother. The film is not a masterpiece, but it is a lighthearted look at single life and people's interactions. It explores some genuine perspectives on interacting with other people and finding the right connections to make these interactions into something more substantial.

447148,"The concept behind this movie--that space aliens in disguise run this planet &amp; enslave working class humans--may be harder to swallow than Marx's class-war scenarios, but I enjoy the way it unfolds throughout the first part of the movie. The genius of taking a social situation and explaining it with a bizarre conspiracy fires the dynamo of this movie's appeal. I dare you to look at politics today &amp; tell me grotesque extra-terrestrials in disguise don't run the nation! We're living the sequel: THEY LIVE 2, How Space Aliens Stole Election 2K!This movie is set in the great Reagan/Bush Era worker displacement &amp; recession. The Wise Republican Presidents had lowered taxes, increased government size, increased government spending (duh!), and grossly increased the national debt (DUHHH!!!) While this created great contentment among the upper crust, it also produced lots of unemployed &amp; displaced workers, ready to do anything for a buck.Our hero wants to work, but can only get day labor, off the books. He lives at a homeless encampment &amp; notices a brutal raid by the LAPD on a small church with an ensuing dragnet through the homeless encampment. He follows clues and comes to see the world through new lenses, lenses that reveal a stark contrast between appearance and underlying reality. Once the blinding dazzle of consumer society has been blocked, the hero can better see the how the media controls the populace. I found this metaphor brilliant--appealing to both mind and heart. Without it, the movie would have lost a star.The first part of the flick is innovative and original. I like the way the underlying premise is slowly revealed. But once the secret is out of the bag, the movie deteriorates rapidly. My son, age 12 when he first watched it with me, kept saying &quot;Dad, why doesn't he do ______?&quot; Sure enough, a few seconds later, the hero would do exactly that! Although the basic premise and some of the underlying metaphors deserve 6 stars, the predictability, and gradual erosion of creativity throughout the movie knocks it down to a four star flick.There are good reasons why this movie never won any awards at Cannes. But it's still fun to watch at least once, and then maybe again with your kids. If you're a 12-year-old boy, it's probably fun to watch every weekend until you're 13.This movie does have one of the most memorable bad lines of any movie in it, one nearly worth the price of purchase:&quot;I'm here to chew gum and kick ass ... and I'm all out of bubblegum!&quot;(If you enjoyed this review, please read my others here at Amazon.

44286,"Citizen X is a deceptively simple film that tells the true story of the Soviet Union's most notorious seriel killer, Andrie Chikatilo.  Played by a chillingly nondescript Jeffrey DeMunn, Chikatilo kills 52 people (including children) over an 8 year time span.  Perhaps the most disturbing aspect of the film (and the murders themselves) is that Chikatilo was not some Hannibal Lectorish genius nor was he a Ted Bundy-type who hid his evil behind a facade of normalcy. Instead (in the film, at least) he comes across as a rather pathetic man whose guilt would be obvious to just about anyone who came across him.  However, as the movie explains, Chikatilo is lucky enough to be committing his crimes in the Soviet Union; the leaders of which refuse to acknowledge that any citizen of a truly communist state could still be so sick as to commit such terrible crimes against his fellow workers.  This is not an obviously political movie and it certainly never makes the mistake of distorting the facts for the sake of propaganda.  However, it does carry a very important subtext -- i.e., when a society refuses to acknowledge the importance of the flawed individual over the faceless and nameless mass, men like Chikatilo emerge from the shadows of that society's willfull ignorance.  (One is reminded, in fact, of how the search for Jack the Ripper was hindered by the Victorian sensibility that the murderer had to be the member of a certain gender and social class.)The police detective who eventually captured Chikatilo (with little help whatsoever from his superiors) is well-played by Stephen Rea who brings a low-key sadness to the role.  Eschewing the stereotypical &quot;supercop&quot; role that seems to show up in most recent police procedurals, Rea instead emphasizes his character's innate decency.  When he becomes obsessed with finding and capturing Chikatilo, it is not portrayed as some sort of cat-and-mouse melodrama but instead the reaction of an inherently good man who cannot sit idly by.  In perhaps the film's most riveting moment, Rea shocks his superiors by breaking down into tears when they refuse his request for more aid.  Its an unexpectedly human moment and its impact is devastating, especially when Rea's superiors respond to his unexpected emotions with the same disbelief given to the idea that the Soviet Union could spawn a seriel killer.The film is very well directed by Chris Gerolmo who, for the most part, resists the temptation to sensationalize the crimes or play for cheap reactions.  He emphasizes the starkness of communist Russia and supplies the film with an even pace that, while never boring, will probably catch viewers looking for a schlocky thriller off guard.Obviously, all of this could add up to a pretty heavy and depressing film and Gerolmo, smartly, does provide the story with some much needed comic relief by casting Donald Sutherland as Rea's only ally in the communist leadership.  Sutherland gives an excellent performance (for which I believe he won an emmy) and brings a slyly sarcastic touch to many of his lines.  Rea and Sutherland make a likeable team and their scenes together have a warmth that this chilly film needs.  As well, Max Von Sydow shows up in one of the roles he seems to specialize in; a cameo as a psychologist who provides a state-forbidden profile of Chikatilo.  Von Sydow does a great job; as does the rest of the film.",N/A
134807,"&quot;Rocky&quot; is one of the great classic films that stands the test of time. This is an original, entertaining and captivating movie. Instead of using large, complex brushstrokes, it makes a great story out of ordinary people. Sylvester Stallone gives a great performance as Rocky, he's not some brute tough-guy, he's just a nice guy who is suddenly given a big chance at his sport. The screenplay by Stallone is an authentic and intriguing journey into the world of boxing, and the side storylines do not interrupt the film's structure but flow along with it. There is also sweet, uplifting romance with the story of Rocky and Adrian (played by Talia Shire, sister of legendary director Francis Ford Coppola). The boxing scenes are exhilarating and exciting, especially the final boxing climax at the end. Overall, &quot;Rocky&quot; is an inspiring movie because it gives hope that people can get a chance at big things, that we can strive for more, and if we work hard and use our minds, we can excell. &quot;Rocky&quot; seems simple, but has strong things to say at its core.

660651,"If your expecting an outrageously campy comedy ala' Priscilla, Queen of the Desert or a film like Strictly Ballroom. . . you'll be very disappointed by this one. Although it's written by the writer of The Full Monty, it's a film that misses more opportunities to be funny than it hits. The fact that a lot of that is intentional is not necessarily a good thing at all. It's also the third film of the late 2000/2001 season that's about hair dressers or wigs ( An Everlasting Piece, The Big Tease ).As the film introduces us to its characters we quickly learn than one of them is dying from cancer. This immediately tells us the film is probably not going to be one full of outrageous and John Waters' like camp comedy (Hairspray, Polyester, Pink Flamingos), but rather be more of a bittersweet, heart-warming romantic comedy of a film that has a pretty interesting gimmick --the hair dressing competition. It doesn't seem to be quite sure what it wants to be as it gives us a main character dying of a disease, a Romeo and Juliet type romance, and a low key Rocky kind of film all delivered with a package that should have been over-the-top campy but isn't.The most famous and respected hairstylists from around the world descend upon the tiny Yorkshire village for the annual hairdressing Championships. We meet former resident Bill(Nighy), a cheating egotist who has brought his estranged daughter Christina (Cook) with him to possibly use as his colorist. Bill also learns his ex chief rival Phil (Rickman) is in town and he can hardly wait to gloat over how much more successful and famous he's become. Phil is divorced and has traded in his gold show scissors to run his modest local barber shop with his son, Brian (Hartnett) while not speaking to his ex-wife Shelley (Richardson) who's in a lesbian relationship with his former hair model Rachel (Griffiths). Shelley and Rachel run a full service salon across town. If this isn't sounding too funny to you.. you're right. It isn't. It isn't supposed to be either. But while these aren't the typical characters we've seen in domestic dramas, we've seen the circumstances for this type of drama too many times to be moved or all that interested in any of it.Good thing we're watching charismatic performances. It is also no big surprise that these characters will eventually be involved with each other again and be competing in the hair dressing contest--exactly as you expect. It's probably not a good sign when what should be a quirky out of the ordinary comedy begins with too heavy a helping of pathos and then becomes and remains extremely predictable from start to finish. Most viewers will be way ahead of the film, and there's not real surprises being offered except perhaps that is not nearly as outrageous or campy as you might be expecting it to be. I won't tell you too much more than that about the film because there aren't all that many surprises or laughs in the film and if you are going to enjoy it all you don't need me ruining some of the film's modest surprises.There are several recognizable faced in the film's cast and they are all quite good in their roles. Alan Rickman however is almost too low key for the majority of the film and that's another missed opportunity because he would have been more fun if his role had been written to allow him to play his part a bit more broadly.Let's review: Blow Dry is all wet. It combs over comedic opportunities in favor of immersing itself in a run through of tangled subplots which dulls much of the potential luster and glow the film's gimmick and performances might have had. In short, it's a pleasant but very modest film that offers absolutely nothing to get the least bit excited about except as an opportunity to see an impressive cast.The DVD looks pretty good over all visually and audio wise the main complaint is that some of the fun music cues are mixed too low. The only notable extra is a brief 7 minute behind the scene featurette which is both promotional and informative. It covers the bases in the expected manner and includes brief comments from one of the producers Sydney Pollack.If you watch Blow Dry without expectations and don't want to think too much, it's an enjoyable film with some decent performances, several overly familiar story lines and a nice gimmick (the hair dressing competition). The film's tone is bittersweet as well as comedic and it misses several opportunities for humor making it a light, warmhearted forgettable little truffle of a film. The DVD is pretty bare bones but for those interested in the cast it might be worth a rental.Christopher J. Jarmick is the co-author (WITH Serena F. Holder) of the criticaly praised suspense thriller THE GLASS COCOON.",N/A

Anyway, Mike Brody (older of the two sons, this time portrayed by Dennis Quaid) is now a marine biologist working at Sea World alongside his girlfriend, Catherine (played by the very beautiful Bess Armstrong).  Sean Brody (younger of the two sons) decides to come visit Mike and Catherine and, with a little help from park water skier Kelly, attempts to conquer his childhood fear of the water.  However, Sean's fears are soon realized as a giant, blood-thirsty great white shark makes its way into the park and begins feeding on its hapless patrons.  Eventually, things are brought to a rather &quot;explosive&quot; conclusion when Mike &quot;pulls the pin&quot; from a grenade that's been lodged in the shark's mouth.The things that really make this film work are the above average acting by an excellent cast, Alan Parker's exciting score (which actually does rival John Williams' original), and a very clever script written by Carl Gottlieb.  Another factor that makes the film so entertaining is simply the fact that it takes place at Sea World.Granted the special effects aren't what they were in the first two films, but they're certainly not bad and are much better than those featured in &quot;JAWS: The Revenge&quot;, the next film in the series.",N/A

484454,"What can I say the cover art of the DVD sucked me in and I bought it.  Well I was expecting a lot from the story line, because of the outside cover, but you should not judge anything by what is on the outside.  What was inside was definitely far different from what I perceived it to possibly have in it.  The plot line was disjointed, but very intriguing, though the messiah image is a bit cliqued, even though it works superbly into this movie.  The messiah plot did have some of its own quirks in this movie that are fairly original.  The whole mood and tone of the movie was oppressing and brooding, the animation surely made a proper set-up for the end of the world.  The characters were excellent, the ones that actually spoke and did not die randomly, especially Fuuma and Kamui.  The visuals were remarkable, definitely better than most animation out there.  The ending was kind of drawn out with a quick conclusion, and a time of mourning.  This is one of the most depressing animes I have seen, even more so than Akira, or the finale of Cowboy Bebop.  Well cheer for the Dragon of Heaven, but weep for the Dragon of Earth and watch something funny after this movie, because it really is depressing.  One complaint, like recent movies, notably Blood, this movie is too short what is the deal extend the movie so we can see some more character development.

46849,"&quot;The Devil is a Woman&quot; is a wholly artificial film, dealing with wholly artificial people, amidst wholly artificial surroundings.  Like  &quot;The Scarlet Empress&quot; with gothic Russia before it, &quot;The Devil is a Woman&quot; takes the simple idea of old Spain during carnival, and exaggerates it into a fantastic world choking itself with an impossible amount of streamers, confetti, and grotesquely constumed revelers.  Essentially to Spanish to possibly be Spanish, the atmosphere created gives a richly textured visual feel. It becomes a costume as garish as those the Spanish people wear, disguising a series of complex and controversial themes, which could never be used as open plot devices. Director Josef von Sternberg is obviously aware of the conventions and restraints set up by Hollywood, twisting them to his own good.  Using the illusion of a typical Hollywood story, he thinly but potently veils these visual costumes, which in themselves hide his rich themes, creating a film so layered its staggering!At the center of all this is a Dietrich so beautiful, it is not quite possible to believe she ever existed outside this fantastic world created for her.  Impeccably lighted, and costumed in the most flamboyant trappings imaginable, she is a toyingly evil creature of film, more alive than ever.  Is it any wonder her character ruins so many men, on film alone you could fall in love with her?!&quot;The Devil is a Woman&quot; is a completely visual film.  It's themes and ideas do not come from what you hear, but what you see.  The plot, which seems to hide them, is really needed only that these themes and visuals may gradually reach you.  I think, essentially, that story for Sternberg was like the cherry flavor in cough medicine, designed only to help you swallow the truly important stuff.  Perhaps we may never reach the center of a film like &quot;The Devil is a Woman.&quot;  If we did would we find the key to everything, or merely emptiness?",The Devil Is a Woman VHS

Teacher Pan does not have e-mail, DVD players, or the wonderful Sony Play Station II.  However, Teacher Pan does have determination, grit, and honor.As a new student of Kung Fu, known as wushu in China, I am beginning to realize the validity of the message portrayed in &quot;Iron and Silk.&quot;  The message that Kung Fu is not just a martial art but a way of life.  As Teacher Pan says, &quot;Do every move as if it were your last.&quot;  How often do we spend days, if not weeks, wasting our time with activities we truly do not care about? Probably far too many.One of my favorite parts of the movie deals with Teacher Pan trying to learn English.

412825,"&quot;Halloween III: Season of the Witch&quot; is, I'd have to say, the most under-rated of the Halloween films.  It gets it's bad reputation because it's the only film in the series that does not feature Michael Myers prominently (he is actually seen in the movie during a scene at a bar when a commercial for a broadcast of the original film comes on a T.V.).Basically, this one centers around a mysterious Halloween mask production company's plot to kill all the children in the United States by planting small metallic devices inside the rubber masks that, when worn by the children during a special T.V. broadcast on Halloween night, will cause them to die a rather gruesome death via the excretion of snakes and other creepy crawlies from inside their bodies.  It's up to a man and his female partner to unlock the company's sinister secrets and bring it their evil plans to a halt before it's too late.I know, sounds a little off-beat, but who cares.  For anyone who is willing to look past the absence of Michael Myers and appreciate this film for what it is, I highly recommend you watch this one.  It's not on T.V. that often, so you'll probably have to either rent it or buy it.If you're a die-hard fan of the series and don't have this in your video collection yet, I would encourage you to purchase it.  However, if you're only a moderate fan I'd say rent it first.Even if you're not a fan of the series but like horror/sci-fi films (this one has a little bit from both genres) in general, I definitely encourage you to give this one a shot.P.S. For those who still continue to wonder why Carpenter went this route for the third installment, the answer is simple.  When &quot;Halloween II&quot; came out critics constantly bashed the film by saying that it was too much like the first one.  Listening to the critics, John and the rest of the people behind &quot;III&quot; decided to make it a completely different film.  The moral to the story, if you get what you asked for and still aren't happy, just shut up.  Unfortunately, though, critics never seem to be able to shup up.",Halloween 3 - Season of the Witch VHS
689475,"This has been unjustly trashed, probably because it's earnest, warm, and gentle, something not usually valued by the ex-film-students who run the indie world.  So defy them and go see this touching gem of a tragicomedy.A lotta g's there.  Anyway,  the movie starts like this; Jay (as in Jennifer, played by Leelee Sobieski) is a self-centered Goth teen, perceptive in some ways, naive in others; you know, typical teenager.  Graduating from school, she needs a job to get her own place, and comes across Randall, a straightlaced but rather kind men's clothing store manager (Albert Brooks), who gives her a job.The movie goes from there.  I won't bother to describe the plot any further because A) it'd blow way too many jokes and B) it's not what you call stunningly original, which would matter if this weren't a character piece.  However, this movie isn't about what happens to Jay and &quot;R&quot;, as Jay dubs him, but how they cause and react to the events in it.The relationship is a bit more complicated than friendship; Jay becomes sexually interested in Randall, which some people have found pretty hard to swallow, or have used to dismiss this as another &quot;middle-aged guy wows young girl&quot; movie, a case of boomer ego.  Lay your fears to rest; this is a movie about a man and a girl entering a father-daughter relationship, not &quot;Autumn in New York.&quot;  I really feel sorry for people who got SO caught up in this aspect of the film that they missed its humor, or its heart.Don't think, however, that just because this movie is touching, it's afraid of going for a belly laugh.  The window dressing alone is worth the price of admission.  I can't emphasize this enough, this movie is FUNNY!The acting is great; Brooks and Sobieski, whether dealing with anger or trading one-liners, have sensational chemistry.  Carol Kane delivers an excellent character performance as Jay's hyper-perky mother, and Michael McKean is a riot as Jay's...imperceptive stepfather.  John Goodman has basically a cameo as Jay's hippie father, and he's funny, as always.Then there's Christine Lahti's direction.  The movie is told from Jay's viewpoint, and at the start, it's gently surreal, with good use made of computer special effects.  Lahti handles this with considerable sensitivity, not neglecting the visual aspects in favor of the actors.  She does quite a good job.This is a movie infused with warmth, heart, and bittersweetness.  It's good for a laugh, and good for a cry, and I heartily recommend it if you want either or both.",My First Mister

The special documentary material includes extensive footage from Powell's earlier film &quot;The Edge of the World&quot; as well as commentary by Thelma Schoonmaker (Powell's widow), Martin Scorcese, and a woman who was so moved by the film that she journeyed to the location.

If you read the book &quot;Reel Bad Arabs&quot; you'd know what I am talking about. The story of this movie could be not all that although it is still an interesting movie to be watched. But what makes this movie one of a kind is that it is the first time Hollywood gives up the stereotype against Arabs and Muslims. The story revolves around 13 warriors who goes to defend a North Kingdom and fight against daemons.

340100,"The premise actually is a very intriguing one for the &quot;classic horror genre,&quot; in that a well-respected doctor, apparently highly regarded for research and innovation that is vaguely left hanging, with a strong religious belief, is approached for healing... and has sufficient idealism to extend the healing arts even to Dracula! Of course, the viewer has no idea of how said doctor was known by Dracula and the Wolf Man, or how he conveniently has the Frankenstein monster on his property, and healing of one who has been dead (then un-dead) for centuries seems excessively ambitious, but the effect remains curiously poignant - the efforts of a man of science, sincerely good, who hopes to find cures for the mind and soul through healing metabolic processes. (That these monsters all had previously died in several feature films is irrelevant - that detail never stopped their reappearance before.)I'm sure I'm not alone (amongst Universal horror film buffs) in having always found Larry Talbot (Wolf Man) to be an extremely sympathetic character. (Remember &quot;The path you walked was thorny, through no fault of your own...&quot; from the original?) This film, in all honesty, is so poorly executed (in the literary sense, since the filmography is good for the genre), and the plot so patchy, largely from seeking to integrate several different and unrelated monster themes, that it is only for fans of the series. Yet it is a great pleasure to see the decent and innocent Larry Talbot cured!Much goes unexplained, of course, and the depiction of the doctor, quite moving in the beginning, is dreadful when, in a puzzling move, a bit of Dracula's blood turns him into (not a vampire but) a mad scientist seeking to kill. The Frankenstein monster would have been well left out, since he plays no real part in anything but the poor ending.Still, it is fun, and just seeing the wolf man restored to health is worth an annual viewing.",N/A
523154,"I thought the movie was excellent, and I probably couldn't add anything new to what others have already said about it.  It is a well thought-out action movie (yes, it really is technically an action movie, as one would say Fugitive is an action movie) with great acting (particularly from Jaoquin Pheonix), add an honor theme, great scenes, and a thrilling plot, and you get a movie that feels like an epic and is a wee bit more than  an &quot;action movie.&quot;  As I'd say, and lots of Hong Kong movies realize this, action shouldn't feel like action more than an extension of character, which I think works here.  Movie sure seem to know how to make the Maximus character seem heroic. As for the DVD itself, I'd have to say this is a very excellently composed DVD.  It has lots of great extras such as extra videos and interviews and storyboards.  The audio and video quality is quite excellent.

413883,"The effect of heroin addiction on a young man and his closest friends is explored in the hard-hitting drama, ""Trainspotting,"" directed by Danny Boyle.  Set in Scotland, Ewan McGregor stars as Renton, a young man to whom drugs have become a way of life; in fact, more than a ""way of"" life, they have ""become"" his life.  And a more filthy, degrading lifestyle one would be hard put to imagine.  Renton has arrived at a point wherein absolutely nothing means anything to him:  Family, friends, job, nothing.  All that matters is the next fix.  And to get it, he will do whatever it takes, including robbing, stealing or even betraying his mates.  It's a hard life, but to ""Rents"" the high-- even with the total loss of self esteem-- makes it all worth it; and he'll get it any way he can:  Snorting, shooting up or using suppositories.  Eventually, however, Renton's bad life gets even worse, and as he emerges on morning from has drug-induced haze, he realizes things are going to have to change.  The question is, can he do it?  Or will he even want to.  The film is a hard look at the depths to which an addict will descend and what one will do to get that fix.  To illustrate the point, there is one graphic scene (almost too hard to watch), in which Renton, losing a couple of suppositories (they had yet to melt) through a sudden act of nature, proceeds upon realizing it to turn around and fish for them in the ""filthiest toilet in Scotland.""  The scene is almost unbearable, but what an example of what it means to be in thrall to drugs.  In another scene, not quite as graphic but powerful nonetheless, Renton's parents lock him in his room and he is forced to go ""cold turkey.""  And although, after the aforementioned scene this is a bit easier to watch, it is still unpleasant, but delivers a succinct message about the nature of drug addiction.  McGregor is well cast as Renton, as he brings a clean-cut look to the part that seems so contradictory to the lifestyle embraced by the character.  The perfect choice of all the characters through which to tell the story, Renton has a look and an attitude that convey a life that holds such promise; here is a lad with a future.  And therein lies a message in itself:  When drugs are involved, never judge a book by it's cover, for addiction is never discerning.  Most importantly, McGregor's performance is believable and he has a charismatic screen presence that makes Renton someone with whom the audience will readily be able to identify, which is necessary for the film to work.  Without that connection, much of the message of this film would be lost, but thanks to McGregor, as well as some bold moments courtesy of director Boyle, it is not.  The supporting cast includes Ewen Bremmer (Spud), Jonny Lee Miller (Sick Boy), Kevin McKidd (Tommy), Robert Carlyle (Begbie), Kelly Macdonald (Diane) and Peter Mullan (Swanney).  One of the best anti-drug films in memory, ""Trainspotting"" will affect even the most jaded abuser of controlled substances, for it puts the situation into perspective and gives it context, while keeping it at (still an uncomfortable) arm's length.  It may be tough to watch, but there are lessons to be learned from it that are invaluable.  A great companion feature to the more recent ""Traffic,"" this is a film that will no doubt have a dramatic affect on those who see it, for the images it presents will not easily be forgotten. And if this film will save even one person from learning about drugs the hard way, then it will have made the endeavor entirely worthwhile.  Be advised, this film is more educational than entertaining, and definitely an experience.",Trainspotting VHS

Fortunately, my fianc&eacute;e had seen Ghost in the Shell before and was able to explain it to me.The animation of Ghost in the Shell is fantastic. In a few places the scenery looks more like it has been filmed rather than drawn, and even the characters have movements that are fluid and graceful, instead of jerky and robotic, like some animated movies can have.The storyline of Ghost in the Shell is pretty straightforward, although the last 15 minutes or so was quite a surprise.  There's a lot of philosophy involved in the movie, mostly about what makes a person truly human, is it the ghost (a soul), or is it the fact we feel human.Ghost in the Shell was well done, and even though I'm not a huge fan of anime I enjoyed it quite a bit.",N/A

540352,"Unlike any other Steven Spielberg movie ever made, you are in for a shocking, mind-bending, often disturbing treatise on the nature of technology, and, perhaps more importantly, on humanity itself.  Much like 2001, and A Clockwork Orange, this movie is touched everywhere by Stanley Kubrick's brilliant hands; it is profoundly engaging, and hits horrifyingly close to home.  Set in a not-too-distant future, and without giving anything away, the movie begins as a couple decides to adopt the first robotic child programmed to love.  As a synopsis for all that follows, this in itself poses more questions that either Spielberg or Kubrick are prepared to answer.  The bottom line is this: the movie will infect your mind, and you will walk away from the theatre unable to shake the images, the emotional power, and the characters from your head.  Do not expect another summer blockbuster -- this movie is devoid of pure sensationalism, though it does feature two outrageously effective performances in Haley Joel Osment and Jude Law, and some of the most imaginative, realistic special effects you've ever seen.  Do not bring young children; even teens will be disturbed by the big questions this movie asks.  Like Kubrick's best films, this movie is a transporting work of science fiction that nearly begs to be seen more than once.  It is an entertainment, but one of the highest order: if you let yourself go there, you are transformed by the experience of seeing it, and some things may never look the same again.",N/A

467711,"I, like so many other people who grew up in the time I did, was first attracted to this film solely through the title song by Dr. Dre on the soundtrack to the film.  It was ridiculous how much I heard that song get played all over the radio and the hype it surrounded the movie with during that spring of 1992.  In fact, it, in many ways, has outlasted the film itself in terms of pop culture's memory.  And that is actually a shame.This a superior thriller, taking the undercover cop story and crafting a tension-drenched and surprisingly subtle movie.  And though it begins to lose its bottom by the end and becomes a little contrived, for the first three quarters of the movie it is expertise and a whole lot more unpredictable than most films of its genre.  Veteran actor Laurence Fishburne stars, in, surprisingly, his first lead role, as an L.A. cop who is assigned to go undercover and infiltrate a major cocaine empire in Los Angeles.  It is a job he reluctantly takes; as a child he witnessed his junkie father killed while pulling a stickup on Christmas Eve.  The flashback of this is shown as the opening scene and is one of the most disturbing in the film, as the young child, who had just listened to his father ask him what he wanted for Christmas, watches the whole bloody incident in horror and pain from the parked car.  This plays heavily on his conscience and his psychic well-being as the film goes on.  He goes everywhere from the seedy streets of the inner-cities and ghettos as a cocaine dealer and manages to get all the way to the highest ranks of the organization.  He does this by working his way into the circle of a mid-level drug distributor.  A supposedly clean-shaven man who owns a house, has a beautiful wife, and an eight-year-old daughter whom he practices the multiplication tables with in the morning.  This key character is played with nervous ingenuity by Jeff Goldblum, in one of his most impressive performances, and is the symbol of the disturbing depths that a man's greed can go to.All of this, while extremely strong assets, are more or less pretty routine in films such as these.  Director Bill Duke, however, manages to take it a step further and elevates this film with style and class.  He has Fishburne narrate the story and allows the langage to be poetic and colorful, something that derives from classic 1940s film noir.  My favorite line in the narration is on Fishburne's first day on the streets as a dealer when the voice-over says ""The great thing about life on the streets is you know how it's gonna be.  It's always the same.  It's always getting worse.""  The strongest and most potent scenes in the film are the ones dealing directly with Fishburne's struggles with the moral decisions he must make.  The ""deeper"" involved he gets in the criminal life, the more he begins to realize the cold and inhuman manner with which the government and authorities have been cast.  It's not that he decides he likes being a drug dealer, it's actually the exact opposite.  He becomes more and more determined to infiltrate the organization, by any means necessary, no matter how violent and chaotic it gets.  As I said, the film does begin to lose its bottom by the end, as the plot becomes slightly overblown, however, I won't go into details as it would spoil some surprises.  And overall the courage and conviction of the performances causes you to forget the lackluster final quarter.  Roger Ebert said that this was ""a drama disguised as a thriller"" and I will have to agree with that statement.  It is much more dependent on characters than on action scenes, and that is what makes it so much better and more intelligent that most of its genre.  Everywhere in this film there is the unmistakeable look and feel of the early '90s, whether it's in the great soundtrack, the sharp cinematography, the fast-paced editing and camera movements, or the screen sweeps that segue from scene to scene.  It was a good time in movies and music, if you ask me, but this film has aged much better than its closest companion 'New Jack City' has.  Possibly one of the most overlooked cop films of the '90s.",N/A
191583,"I'm not a western-movie-watching kind of girl, generally speaking.  One of my friends said this was his very favorite movie, though, that he cries every time he watches it.  So I gave it to him, and when he'd watched it again, I borrowed it.  And even though it's not my style, I really enjoyed it.  It has a wonderful pace, for one thing.  For the first little while I thought I was bored, but then I looked at the clock and I'd been watching for much longer than I would have guessed.I suppose you could call it a lot of kinds of story -- it's a story of friendship, it's got your basic cowboys and indians stuff going, it's just got some of every kind of western movie plot I can think of -- but for me one of the central things is that it's about all the different ways people can be good.  All the characters aren't good; in fact there are some pretty awful ones, but there's a lot of goodness in a lot of the people in this movie.  It just comes out in different ways in each of them.  That's a pretty powerful point to make.",N/A
39775,"&quot;It's A Wonderful Life&quot; surely must rank as one of the finest American movies ever made. It is one of my favorite holiday movies during the Christmas season, and certainly the one with the best acting. Jimmy Stewart is absolutely incredible as George Bailey, whose unlikely encounter with an angel Clarence (Henry Travers) allows Bailey to see how he's helped so many of his neighbors. Essentially, this film is a warm-hearted version of Dickens' &quot;A Christmas Carol&quot;, replete with much American optimism. It's also a subtle cinematic ode to friendship, family and faith. Aside from Travers, the supporting cast, including Donna Reed and Lionel Barrymore, is superb. Without a doubt it's a popular film during Christmas that ought to be required viewing throughout the year.",N/A
562791,"How typical of fanboys... one of the first things I noticed when reading the reviews were the comments on &quot;not enough fighting as the first disc&quot; or &quot;I expected more fights&quot; etc., etc ( Heaven forbid the same people watch the Patlabor movies ) . I guess when one ignores the great pacing, the vivid imagery, and the tasteful cinematography of the third episode one would consider it &quot;slow&quot;. But what the last two installment does is create a believable situation to the tragic and heart-rending tragedy of Himura. There is a noticeable introduction of CG elements in here, but it comes across as akward, especially with the melding of real-time sea-water and animated cels. Thankfully, this process is only done briefly, and does not hamper the overall visuial feel of series. The animation is solid, and the combat scenes of the last episode are so good that one can almost forgive the overtly violent scenes from the last two. And sorry, but just 'cuz there are swords and samurai in here doesn't necessarily mean that a Kurosawa comparison is in order.

485687,"Another superb DVD has just been released by Anchor Bay : Robert Aldrich's THE GRISSOM GANG, adapted from James Hadley Chase's &quot;No Orchids for Miss Blandish&quot;. Excellent movie but only the choice between the standard and the widescreen version and a scene access as bonus features. Extra meager. Sound and images more than OK for me.Robert Aldrich is more known as a successful director of action movies like THE DIRTY DOZEN than as a sensitive observer of psychological dramas but with THE KILLING OF SISTER GEORGE, released in 1968 and THE GRISSOM GANG, Big Bob showed that a golden heart was beating under his elephant skin.Don't get me wrong ! THE GRISSOM GANG is also a gangster movies loaded with machine guns duels and vicious killings but what's more interesting is the description of the relationship between Slim, the psychotic killer, and Barbara Blandish, the spoiled heiress. This unusual couple has to face a collection of secondary characters one will not forget so easily. For instance, Ma Grissom, played by Irene Dailey, a criminal genius and an overprotective mother, or Eddie - Tony Musante - Hagan, the archetype of the gangster of the 30's, so seductive but ready to kill anything that moves, even women, if necessary.In the good guys section of the movie, there is someone who, in spite of his millions, could have been part of the Grissom gang : Wesley Addy, Barbara's father and often present in Aldrich's films, his attitude is one of the most disturbing seen in a movie.All in all, an excellent addition to your library.A DVD zone Bonnie and Clyde.",N/A

530277,"'Lost Souls' makes an effort to be a film that ranks up there with 'The Exorcist' but it doesn't quite succeed.  I agree with the majority of the reviews posted here regarding the spectacular cinematography.  The director manages to create an dark atmosphere that literally screams suspense.  However, this does not compensate for the weak, unoriginal storyline and sub-par performances by some of the actors.  Wynonna Ryder's performance in particular, is flat and downright unbelievable.  She fails to inject any real emotion or drama in her performance whatsoever, which seriously damages the film.  We don't view her as the unlikely hero, the saviour of mankind, just as an annoyance whose whole approach is 'ho hum, been there, done that'.  Ben Chaplin is equally middle-of-the-road in his performance, although I think he did what he could with what he was given.  They tried to focus on creating a sympathetic and likable character, but he and Ryder have NO on-screen chemistry, which certainly didn't help.  You end up waiting for some big thing that never happens (well, until the end). John Hurt manages to steal most of the scenes that he is in...and even manages to out-act Ryder when he is supposed to be in a coma (what does THAT tell you).It was a extremely good move to keep the so-called exorcisms reduced to distorted, half-seen segments, filled with screams of agony and terror.  This forced the viewer to rely on their imagination, as it is the unseen, the unknown, is usually what provokes the most fear.  For example, take the first 'Alien'  'Halloween', 'Psycho', or 'Nightmare on Elm Street' for example. You never really got a good look at that alien, Michael Meyers, Norman's Mother or Freddy Kruger in the original version of any of these films.  That's what made it so damn scary as our childhood fear of the dark or the boogeyman, were justified time and again.  This was one of the few redeeming qualities of the film because when film-makers rely on in-your-face tactics, it usually ends up just being unrealistic and cheesy special effects.  However,this film tends to take itself too seriously in its efforts to make it a new twist on an old story, and frankly, it just doesn't cut it.  It relies on the same old religious references and 'evil' icons.  The cinematography and the surprise ending are really the only thing that make this film worth watching.  Rent it first, you'd have to be a pretty serious fan of this genre or Ryder or whoever to find it worthy of a purchase.",N/A
120288,"Any Given Sunday feels longer than it's 151 minutes, mainly because it tries to cram too much in. Oliver Stone is a fine movie director although his recent offerings have been paltry, including this one. The violent and break-neck on-field action is captured perfectly. The problem lies within the movie's insipid two-dimensional characters. Al Pacino brings a wearied cynicism to his role as Coach D'Amato and is excellent as usual. The only other credible characters are a cocky halfback played by professional rapper LL Cool J, and Matthew Modine as a conscienious team doctor.The second disc of this 2-disc set features screen tests, including a home video of Jamie Foxx tossing a football in a park. It also features a 'making of' plus there are deleted scenes with commentary by Oliver Stone. If you enjoyed the movie, I definitely recommend this movie for purchase for it's superb extras.Many will find this movie slow-moving despite the football action, though. It's standard fare as far as football films go. There is nothing here that hasn't been done already which leads one to re-think the whole football film genre.Unless you are a football fan, stay well away.",N/A
33878,"I rarely buy movies. But I did buy American History X.This is the incredibly powerful story of two brothers who fall into the trap of racism and hate. It is also the story of these brothers trying to free themselves from racism and hate. After spending some time in prison for murdering two blacks who try and steal his car (a dispute starting with a basketball game), former neo-nazi Derek Vinyard (Edward Norton) leaves his incarceration a changed man. To his dismay, however, he find that his younger brother is walking the same path he once did. The movie uses black-and-white scenes from the past in conjunction with color scenes in the current situation to establish Derek's sordid history as a vicious racist and show his path to change.The younger brother, Danny (Edward Furlong), idolizes Derek. In fact, the local coterie of skinheads all do. Derek has a power to feed the hate of his retinue with fiery rhetoric that targets ethnic groups indiscriminately with intense indignation. The movie is truly scary when you see the skinheads bonding, brought together by an irrational hate and Derek's ability to gratify it with his fierce oratories.Edward Norton was robbed when the Academy denied him the Oscar for Best Actor (he was nominated, though). His performance is compelling and real...frighteningly so. He effectively straddles the line between a smart kid with dumb ideas and the true racist seething with hate. I sincerely think he is one of Hollywood's most promising actors. Edward Furlong is also powerful, which is shocking for an actor of his age. Danny shares Derek's hate, but not the ability to convey it &quot;rationally.&quot; The script is stunning, likewise the directing and editing.The movie is violent and brutal, almost disturbingly so, but it is critical to underscore the power of the story. This is not tasteless killing. And it does not glorify racism...it exposes the consequences of racism and its absurdity. It shows how screwed-up people can rise above the pettiness of hate. One of the most powerful scenes in the movie is when Derek and Danny pull down all the Nazi crap on his bedroom wall.This movie is intense, as well. I must have lost 20 pounds watching it, because my heart was pounding insanely hard. The ending is horrifyingly sad...I have to wonder if I've ever been more moved by a movie.Be warned: It's brutal, gritty, and emotionally heavy. But at the same time it's a remarkably powerful story with first-rate acting and a powerful message. Don't pass this one up.",N/A
251897,"&quot;Say Anything&quot; pinpoints a different kind of 80s love story movie, with less ridiculous attempts at comedy and more of a meaningfull plot. John Cusack spent most of the 80s spinning out classic teenaged comedy, but cuts down on the often needless immature and spastic humor in this movie. His trademark I think is his nervous and eager personality as the classic underachiever. Playing C student Lloyd Dobbler about to graduate from high school, he falls helplessly in love with the shy and lacking of self-esteem validictorian Diane Cort, played by Ione Skye. Lloyd lives with his sister Constance, a single mother and an un-credited part played by John's sister Joan Cusack, and focuses his life around kick-boxing. Lloyd and Diane wind up falling in love despite their differences, but are torn apart by the legal troubles of Diane's father, played excellently by John Mahoney. The movie centers around Cusack's determination to hold on to his relationship with Skye, doing everything it takes for them to stay together. The performances and original storyline are what make &quot;Say Anything&quot; great, and the movie is full of scenes that will never die. Scenes like Cusack holding a radio above his head outside Skye's bedroom window one night playing &quot;In Your Eyes&quot; by Peter Gabriel. No one by John Cusack could've done something better and more effective in a film. &quot;Say Anything&quot; in my mind is a new classic, a movie worth having when the box office keeps pucking up the same romantic attempt at garbage every year, I give the movie 5 stars.",Say Anything VHS

As far as &quot;making a statement,&quot; I give it no stars, but for entertainment value, it's a five-star treat.

372835,"For many years, I have considered Leonardo Da Vinci to be the most talented person who ever lived and this series of videos reinforces that belief. While the dialog and many circumstances are based on little more than conjecture, the story does give you an indication of the amazing talent that was loaded into just one man. Since it has been reproduced so many times, it easy to forget that ""The Last Supper"" covers an entire wall. The magnitude and detail of the painting are even more impressive when you understand that. It also increases your disgust when you realize how it has been treated down through the centuries.His talents as a thinker, inventor and engineer are just as impressive. Many of his ""inventions"" were centuries ahead of their time, anticipating many devices such as the submarine and tank. While none were actually constructed, many of the design principles were sound and it took many people to regenerate his revolutionary ideas.The tapes also give you detailed insight into the political and economic structure of southern Europe at that time. Northern Italy was the center of the Renaissance, and the city states were economically powerful but militarily weak nations. Ruled by wealthy people who would not have had that kind of political power in earlier centuries, that wealth was spent in the support of court artists so that they could create works to enhance the prestige of the rulers. While this placed substantial resources at the disposal of the artist, it also made them subject to the fickle political winds that were constantly blowing across northern Italy.His service to deposed rulers made him politically suspect and he was forced to relocate several times during his life. I had never realized that the famous Mona Lisa had been moved so many times. One can only speculate on what his accomplishments would have been had his travels been reduced. It was also new to me that he was once brought up on anonymous charges of heresy, which could have led to his being executed as a heretic.One of the greatest artists of all time, Leonardo was also one of the great observers, seeing many things that no one else did. Using these observations as a model, he cataloged and invented many things that were centuries ahead of their time. Had he completed it, his books on human anatomy and painting would no doubt still be in use. Leonardo Da Vinci could have achieved a significant place in history in many different areas, together they make him the most talented of all time and these tapes will help you understand the man and the world he lived in. I was amazed, impressed and humbled when I watched them.",Life of Leonardo Da Vinci 3pc  VHS
243075,"Finally ...... one of those DVD re-releases I've been practically holding my breath for, and was not disappointed.  This criminally overlooked gem was trashed by critics upon its release in 1970, and never enjoyed a video transfer worthy of the filmmaker's effort, not even on laserdisc!  And as you can see from the varying reviews, the controversy rages on.  Which just proves how alive and well and timely a film Catch-22 truly is.Mike Nichols captures the essence of Joseph Heller's defining anti-war classic quite admirably, with a faithful adaptation by Buck Henry (who can be seen along with a veritable Who's Who period ensemble cast), with an eye as removed and objective as Kubrick, yet at times very visually subjective ..... an approach used to great advantage in his previous hit film The Graduate.  All the verbal and ethical contradictions of the book bring its dark humor to demented life, through a kaleidoscopic cavalcade of archtypical characters who make up the living nightmare of one Captain Yossarian, who has decided he can no longer bear to fly the combat missions his superiors have made it impossible to get out of.  To get out of flying, he has to be officially diagnosed as &quot;crazy&quot;, and must request to be grounded ..... but if he requests to be grounded, then he's not really crazy, and is therefore eligible to keep flying missions.  That's some catch, that Catch-22.This film, like the book on which it's based, is not so much an indictment of the insanity of war as it is a look at how the corporate mentality can find its way into the noblest of causes, and how beurocratic manipulations devaluate basic human principles, which take a back seat to merely &quot;looking good&quot;.  A timeless theme indeed.  This skewed logic is cheerfully accepted by all the story's characters ..... until our Yossarian's eyes are opened to the product of that logic literally disemboweled at his fingertips (yes, that scene was put back in!), and suddenly he is the outsider whose prime mission is to avoid any more missions.  Which is not an easy thing to do when Brass keeps adding more after you've completed your tour of duty.As far as the transfer itself:  It has probably never looked better since the original theatrical release over 30 years ago, especially being the first widescreen release of this title, which is the only way to experience it as intended.  The transfer team did the best they could with the mono soundtrack, I'm sure, which does get compressed and distorted at times, something we enthusiasts of early films live with.Mike Nichols' Catch-22 may only enjoy cult status, but it is DVD releases like this (and that other oddball, star-studded 60's curiosity Candy) that make one truly appreciate what is being done with this revolutionary medium.  Hey, not all movies can be for everybody.  Long live the Anti-Blockbusters!",N/A
529999,"I decided to rent &quot;Meet the Parents&quot; from a recomendation from one of my freinds. And it turned out to be a very entertaing, freshing departure from the norm of most comedy's. Here's something i could sort of relate to...well not entirly. But i could sort of undertsand where this guy is coming from. Meets the parents of your love one for the first time, it could be quit tough, i mean trying to impress them, showing them that your willing to go out of their way for their daughter , that you really deserve her. And while trying to do such a thing can be quit troublesome, ..Trust me, i know...boy do I know. And alot what you try to get across comes out the wrong way, not the way you intended. It's either how you come across to the folks, how you talk, how smart you are, your likes, your dislikes, how willing you are, coming up with one single converstation that won't fall flat in the last 2 minutes. And as much as you try, you could never get where you want to go. This could be just as depressing when it comes to acutally talking and trying to impress a girl in general, a girl that seems to like you, but in a way doesn't. Your confused , you don't know what to think, your verbal comunication with her,...can be alot better than it is. The trouble is that you don't know how to fully open up around her. Sure your a nut-ball when it comes being around your best buds. But when your around her, everything is different. Theres a simple joy of seeing her happy, seeing that cute smile of hers'. You try and you try, and from day to day it seems less sucessful, you look back at the days when your did thought were impresing her, and say to yourself.&quot;Maybe I should just give up..&quot; Then your realize it wasn't their doing,..but yours. It's your disadvantage of being who you are. Your shy, your not very good at making conversation, and you then blame it all on yourself. And when that happens depression kicks into full gear. You find yourself doing things that you wouldn't normally do, walking the town for no reason, just collecting your thoughts, as you sip a cold beer. Life can be cruel, but you know what, you are your own worst enemy. Time goes on, and after a while and you don't know what to think. All of this is what this movie represents, while I was watching this, I really felt bad for the guy, but it made me think on how pointless and unmeaningful my life really is. Here is a guy who in the end really suceeded, who acutally made it to FIRST base. This is one of the main reasons what made this movie so charming. And in the end I really felt for them , and i was really happy for the couple. Becasue I was seeing something that will never happen to me, something I yern for. Something that I wish for, with this girl that i really love. There's all these conflicting images, and symbols, one of them being the ex-boyfreind, the competion, the struggle. In my case the boyfriend that has her, and doesn't seem to let her go. But in the end the ex-boyfreind winds up being greatful, forgiving, happy for his new rival. That he is lucky enough to have such a great girl, I tend to feel the same way at times, I think , well as long as she is happy, i'll be happy. And you want to tell her boyfreind that he is the luckyiest SOB on the planet, and he is. This movie is both touching, and flat-out Hilarious. This film is just as much a comedy as it is a Love Satire, and it's a winner in both areas. The peformances are wonderful, Robert De Niro never fails to impress me, one of the greatest dramatic actors who ever lived, and what a shame it would be, when he finnally leaves us, something I would never hope for. And Ben Stillar is just fine as the new forth-coming son-in-law, who brings and air of forgiveness and warmth to it all.

350533,"Some people seem to think &quot;L'Avventura&quot; is Antonioni's first 'Great' film. No Way! Antonioni was already up there with the all-time greats with his first two Fifties masterpieces &quot;Chronicle of a Love Affair&quot; and &quot;Le Amiche,&quot; (Glad to say &quot;Le Amiche&quot; is now available in a very good transfer on IMAGE DVD with removeable subtitles in all its rapid-fire Italian dialogue glory which you can freeze and study at your own pace) although he didn't become quite the Revolutionary of Cinema until about the time of &quot;Il Grido (The Cry)&quot; which hinted at everything that soon crystalized on the magnificent trilogy of &quot;L'Avventura,&quot; &quot;La Notte,&quot; and &quot;The Eclipse,&quot; &amp; later even expanded into an almost romantic and transcendent view of the future (through individuation &amp; discarding of outdated myths and customs) in the vastly underrated artistic coup-d'etat of American cinema &amp; all of American commercial culture: the awesome post-Hippie tour-de-force &quot;Zabriskie Point&quot; (a multi-million dollar commercial disaster that severely crippled Antonioni's later ability to raise financing).The superb ultra-dense and illuminating commentary on the first disc of Criterion's &quot;L'Avvenura&quot; by Gene Youngblood (author of the late '60s cinematic theory classic &quot;Expanded Cinema&quot;; for a different take on Antonioni, that goes even deeper than what Youngblood has to say on this disc without becoming didactic or pretentious in any 'film-or-art-school gibberish' way, you cannot do much better than William Arrowsmith's long essay in &quot;Antonioni: Poet of Images&quot;;), that alone, along with the pristine transfer of the film itself (only one negligable line in the final party scene which they've reduced to an absolute minimum) would easily be worth the price of 4 movie tickets.But you also get a second disc which doesn't have too much on it, but what it does have is fantastic: a rare 1 hour mid-'60s French documentary on Antonioni &amp; Jack Nicholson's passionate reading of 3 of Antonioni's most insightful essays (and later a recalling of a hilarious incident on the set of &quot;The Passenger&quot;).Now, for a superstar like Nicholson (who has never embarrassed himself as an artist or sold-out to the Hollywood mainstream despite a thousand and one opportunities &amp; made the producers of &quot;Batman&quot; pay points through the nose for agreeing to appear in that fluff piece) to take the time to pay his respects to a director he truly admires, and promote the sale of this DVD, should teach some of the younger generation of actors something (or even Robert De Niro, who has for many years now, it's pretty friggin' obvious, gone completely mainstream, and is busy doing DVD commentaries for awful pieces of unfunny, brain-dead commerical putritude like &quot;Meet the Parents,&quot; that didn't need his commentary to sell a zillion copies!)! The documentary is in Black and White and among other things which are of supreme interest for cineastes, are the rare interviews with Cesare Zavattini (one of the founders of Neo-Realism), Ennio Flaiano (Fellini's and Antonioni's co-writer), Giovanni Fusco (the Rolls Royce to Ennio Morricone's Ford Mustang in the Paisano hierarchy of film composers), Monica Vitti (at home, in the early '60s with Antonioni himself, who doesn't talk to the interviewer &amp; only throws in an occasional comment!), and Fellini (taking a break from filming &quot;Juliet of the Spirits&quot; to talk to the enquiring interviewer about his friend &amp; co-writer on &quot;The White Sheik&quot;). There are some rare, very revealing shots of Antonioni directing films which give you a rough idea of his style of interaction with cast and crew (in one scene, he is shown directing Princess Soraya, the former wife of the Shah of Iran, whom the Shah had divorced for not having borne him a son!). Last but not least, we also get to see the ridiculously vulgar American trailer for &quot;L'Avventura&quot; that tries to sell it to 'high-class' American audiences as some kind of 'sophisticated' European sex-exploitation film by showing every 'provocative' little snippet in the entire film!",L'Avventura VHS
230698,"That's the way this film was advertised when it came out in 1981, in the classic Universal monster sense ""a monster movie.""  As a child of divorce, I had a weekend Dad that would take my sister and me to any movie regardless of rating (well, within limits) and this one scared us silly.  I remember sitting in the theater and watching the transformation (having seen Lon Chaney Jr.'s transformation in ""The Wolf Man"" I was familiar with the lineage of the genre and the example this film had to live up to... having seen ""The Howling"" later (not much later, as the films nearly competed with each other theatrically) I was a huge fan of Rob Bottin and his mentor, Rick Baker (not to mention the late, great Dick Smith and the master of splatter, Tom Savini), I was just glued to the screen during one of the coolest effects of all time, just awed by what was happening, and just freaked at the believability of it all when compared to the stop-motion transformation of the Chaney makeup) not to mention the scene with David Naughton (""be a Pepper! Drink Dr. Pepper!) and Jenny Agutter in bed (not to mention the shower)... yowza! (Well, I was 11).The only thing that's ever bugged me about this film is the lack of what's supposed to be a supremely gory scene that Landis cut out because it overwhelmed the scene that came after it (supposedly, audiences were so grossed out and shocked that they babbled through the entire dialogue scene that followed David waking up in the wolf's pen at the zoo): the scene was the expanded murders of the bums by the dock, and I don't think it makes it to this new DVD version of the film (which is a bummer, because the expanded gore in Verhoven's Robocop (Criterion edition) actually plays better than the MPAA approved version).In any case, this is a truly great ""monster movie"" in every sense of the word... it's gross, funny, sexy, exploitative in many ways (the book ""Splatter Movies"" calls it gore porn), truly a Landis film by dint of it's ""in"" jokes and orgy of automotive mayhem, and it offers great acting and casting (even in small roles like the Pakistani shift worker at the hospital and the punks on the London Underground).  Just an all-around fun movie, with truly amazing, and Oscar-winning effects (still looking awesome and believable... nothing digital comes close!!  I'll say it again: digital just ain't there yet... the transformation looks bone crunching, painful, horrific, and stretches the imagination in more ways than one).  Bottom line, I've waited for this damn DVD forever... the first edition DVD was slop and went out of print so fast, I was lucky to find a video store copy to rent.  No extras on that one... but this one is the one to own.",N/A

I frankly don't know where to start with,,  The story itself is pretty interesting;a british boy, who lives in this small coal mining town with intensified strikes going on, happens to find his hidden talent as a ballet dancer.It is a very powerful movie because it gives out this inspiration, motivation, little push to change your life if you are caught up with the situation/circumstances.  I'm not joking here, but I literally packed all of my video games and systems (which happen to be my precious collection over years) to sell them and move on to be a determined law school student,,(which ended up in unpacking everything i've packed..it was so close though,,).  I mean, I could never ever picture myself throwing away my precious game collections, but this movie actually persuaded me to throw them away to dance for my own dream, almost.  This movie shows a burning desire of a boy, (hold it right there!) you see, do you know what it feels like to have that burning desire? that you wanna do something so bad yet you are strained by your own family,,  This movie did an excellent job on building/developing the struggle by Billy with the family, outside, and himself.  man,, this boy surely knows how to dance,,let me tell you that-  (I'm seriously considering of registering a dance class, though i'm not much of a dancer)I absolutely agree with the other reviewer who said that this movie was overlooked during Oscar ceremony.  I don't know about you, but i couldn't understand why the Billy Elliot wasn't picked as a best movie, well at least it's better than Gladiator.  This already maginificient movie with struggling, dancing, maturing boy, is again solidified with the father's decision to sacrifice himself utterly, i mean utterly and vague touch of Billy's gay friend, who adds more to the depth of the story with this faint scent of nostalgia.Aaahh(sigh),, I literally watched his dancing scenes more than,, i don't even remember,,  But this boy, who wants to be a ballet dancer, will either make you cry with tears of determination or give that warmth that you haven't felt for a long time.Hey people, dance like Billy, dance like Billy to go forth to reach for your dream regardless of the struggle, obstacle, and circumstances,, if Billy can do it, then you and I can do it  =)",N/A

283872,"I love this movie.  I thought POLTERGEIST III was a pretty good end to the trilogy.  So what if they went low budget this time?  It still turned out pretty good.  The only complaint I have is the lack of Jerry Goldsmith's original score.  Jerry Goldsmith is a big-budget composer, but this was a low budget movie, so Joe Renzetti (1988's CHILD'S PLAY) was called in.  The least he could have done was reprise &quot;Carol Anne's Theme&quot;.  However, there is a sweet 2nd theme for Carol Anne at the end, so I guess that is a farily well make-up.The reason why Scott was missing at the end is because they had to re shoot the end.  The girl in Nancy Allen's arms wasn't even Heather O'Rourke, due to the young actress' death.  The cast and crew wasn't exactly in the best mood, because of this.  They just re-shot the ending and did not even give a second thought to Scott.  It was just too depressing.  Let's just say that he ended up back with his family.To sum this movie up, it is basically the same thing as the first two, same formula.  Just replace Steve &amp; Diane (Craig T. Nelson &amp; JoBeth Williams) with Pat &amp; Bruce (Nancy Allen &amp; Tom Skerritt), replace the suburban neighborhood of Questa Verde with the urban city of Chicago, and replace upbeat orchestral music with more subtle electronics, and you've got POLTERGEIST III!In conclusion, I highly recommend this movie for you if you liked the first 2.  It may seem very different due to the lack of the things mentioned above, but is still a very fun film to watch.  There is no better end to this wonderful trilogy!This review is dedicated to the memory of Heather O'Rourke:(1975-1988)",N/A

460653,"Few animated films can be comfortablly labeled &quot;important&quot;.  Mamoru Shinzaki's &quot;Barefoot Gen&quot; is, without a doubt, one of these films.  Based on Keiji Nakazawa's poignant graphic novel, the film tells the story of a family and how their lives are affected by the atomic bomb dropped on Hisroshima in 1945.  Shinzaki perfectly adapts Nakazawa's somewhat akward style of drawing and adds dimension to these already strong characterizations.  The animation is a bit on the stiff side.  The style of animation looks a bit like what we stereotypically think of when picturing anime.  While there are moments of great beauty and grace (mostly in the film's backgrounds), the animation is closer to Speed Racer than Princess Mononoke.  The film elegantly re-tells Gen's tragic story of survival, streamlining the narative for the big screen.  Missing from the film are several charming vignettes as well as two of Gen's brothers.  Focusing mainly on Gen and his actions and responses, the film loses some of the comic's political vigor but retains a strong voice against war.  Never is the film anti-American.  It matter of factly cries out against the pointlessness of war.  It is mainly through the horrors witnessed in uncompromising graphic detail (even more so in the comic) that this message is most vivid.  And yet Barefoot Gen is ultimately a story of survival.  Gen is a hero and his actions speak of the amazing potential of the human spirit when faced with the unspeakable.  The only thing you will be longing for after the film's somber closing is more.  Like &quot;Grave of the Fireflies&quot;, &quot;Barefoot Gen&quot; is more than worthy of a spot in any collector's library.",N/A
571789,"I just finished watching this movie for the second time, and it still wowed me. The wacky, off-beat script is handled perfectly by an outstanding cast, and one cannot help but be drawn into Nurse Betty's touching journey to find another, only, in the end, to find herself.I sat in awe of the superb performance given by Renee Zellweger. The movie is worth buying just to see what a fine actress can do with a challenging role. Wisely, the director gives her the camera, and the results are magnificent.Sincere and balanced performances by the entire cast make ""Nurse Betty"" a fine example of ensemble acting at its best.I greatly admire Morgan Freeman, and he, as usual, gives a wonderful performance. Greg Kinnear is also to be commended for the absolute mastery of his character. His work with Renee Zellweger is of the highest calibar.I was particularly moved by the scene in the car when Renee Zellweger talks with Greg Kinnear about a day she spent with her mother - what a wonderful moment of superb acting.I was also impressed by the fine use of music in the film to help create mood.This is a movie not everyone will like, but I think it will hold a special place in the hearts of those it touches. The only negative thing I can say about the movie is the needless use of profanity. It added nothing to the film, and hurt a lovely script. Bravo, for ""Nurse Betty."" Thanks for a great movie.",N/A

178152,"This Gun for Hire was based on the Graham Greene novel A Gun for Sale and was considerably toned down and glammed up for the early 40s movie going public. Not that there's anything wrong with that.I found this movie rather enjoyable, it is easy to see why Ladd and Lake were made into a screen team. They are supported by Laird Cregar as a plotting spy with no stomach for violence and Robert Preston as Veronica Lake's cop boyfriend. Alan Ladd steals the show as Raven, a killer for hire who really only likes cats. (as a cat lover, I was automatically more sympathetic to him) Cregar's Gates betrayed him to the cops and now he wants revenge.Raven and Lake's Ellen, a nightclub magician, cross paths throughout the movie and she begins to strip down his tough guy veneer to reveal an abused childhood. Armed with her brains and a considerable amount of flag waving, Ellen tries to persuade Raven to give up his vengeance and uncover an Axis plot.Ladd, Lake and Cregar are all marvelous but the usually wonderful Preston (best known for his smooth con-man in Music Man) isn't given much to work with and his cop character feels flat especially next to Raven.This movie is really a must-see for any fan of 40's films and even with its flaws (I also found the final image to be annoying and totally against Lake's independant character), it is still a pleasant way to pass an evening.",N/A

Though the case, Christie's first published mystery, isn't one of her most baffling (go to THE ABC MURDERS also available on DVD for that), it is certainly full of the author's well-known devices: a murder by poisoning (Christie was a poison expert having worked in a dispensery during World War I), a suitable cast of suspects who we inevitably learn all had reason enough for wanting the victim dead, and the studied investigation by our Belgian sleuth with the usual endearing incompetence of his friend Arthur Hastings.These BBC adaptations are beautifully made, faithful in their period touches (though, of course, Hastings and Poirot don't look any younger here than in their later adventures which take place at least ten to fifteen years later), and the casting as always couldn't be better.Though lacking much in the way of supplements (the information on Agatha Christie and David Suchet is repeated on each disc in the series), the clarity of the picture and clear sound (alas mono) make owning these DVDs a must for mystery lovers.",N/A

276565,"Conventional opinion in the realm of Marx mania targets this movie as inferior. It is ironic that top-of-the-line MGM was partly responsible for diminishing the later Marx magic by teaming silly scripts and moronic musical numbers with the lunacy of the Marx screen persona. This tone-deaf creative acumen relegated Messrs. Marx to lesser material in their last three films at the studio. Take courage; not all is lost. Looking past the annoyances of Kenny Baker's unfortunate singing and the goofy dancing horse number, we can see Marxian mirth in good health. Groucho, without an ID badge, tries to board the circus train guarded by Chico, and we are off to more classic comedy. As Groucho and the guys try to obtain an incriminating cigar from a thieving midget, Marx mayhem prevails. The spirited performance of ""Lydia the Tattooed Lady"" is also a definite plus. Harpo struggles, at times, to find something relevant to do. His pantomime antics do not always make sense within the! context of the action. However, Harpo's mischievous elfin qualities sparkle as he and Chico search the sleeping strongman's room for the missing money. Despite a bias against intrusive musical numbers..., Harpo connects with the singing and dancing African-American kids in a way that illustrates that his otherworldy perspective truly transcends mere racial barriers. His harp solo punctuates this segment nicely. Margaret Dumont is again on hand as the hilarious target of Groucho's barbed zingers. Even with its faults, this is an enjoyable Marx Brothers jolt for fans of classic comedy. Fast forwarding through the dull spots makes multiple viewing a treat. ;-)",N/A

676249,"The ghost of John Newman Edwards must have had a hand in writing the script. The movie is pure legend, with not a shred of history allowed to intrude. I liked it. It worked because they didn't try to play it too seriously. This was the flaw in the Rob Lowe/Bill Paxton movie &quot;Frank and Jesse&quot;--they tried to make us take their hopeless mangling of history seriously.&quot;American Outlaws&quot; played it for fun, adventure, and legend. It covers only a single year time span during which time they seem to have robbed every bank in Missouri. Busy boys. The gang was also a sensitive, nurturing gang to the lesser-known members (funny scene).I can't possibly list all the diversions from actual history they made as they barely ever drifted even close to reality. Cole Younger would have hated the movie--they had him portrayed as the dumb guy. Frank was the smart one, and Jesse, of course, was the cute, dangerous one. The Irish guy who played Jesse did a good job. He didn't sound like he was trying to overcome an Irish accent, did a good, flat American, but he didn't really sound like anyone from Missouri either. He almost miraculously managed to always have that ever-so-manly two-day growth of beard ala Miami Vice.The setting was the film's biggest weakness--it looked much more like California than Missouri. Way too brown and dry, wrong kinds of trees. The town of Liberty looked like a generic Hollywood western town set, not at all right.So, I recommend &quot;American Outlaws&quot; as a fun action movie, _not_ as history. They did use the perils to returning Rebels pretty well at first but soon lost that to the whole purely fictional railroad plotline. Don't expect anything like &quot;Ride With the Devil&quot; out of this (though there is a nifty battle scene at the beginning).",N/A
532436,"Writer/director Night Shyamalan had a hard act to follow after his success with ""The Sixth Sense"", but he outdid himself with ""Unbreakable"", a film I liked even better.  This is an outstanding tale that incorporates fantasy, adventure, suspense, mystery, human interest and a complex character study of a man coming to terms with an unusual gift.  The story maintains its intriguing edge throughout, and just when the viewer thinks the last surprise has been revealed, another leaps forth.  The ending is fantastic, and will certainly surprise anyone who hasn't been tipped off.The direction is superb in every aspect.  The photography is outstanding, with creative use of the camera that enhances the mystery and drama of the film.  Though some have complained about the pace of the film, I found it to be necessarily deliberate, avoiding the temptation to rush through the psychological elements and heightening the suspense.  The direction of the actors is also smartly done, with everyone working well together creating a realistic feel despite a story that flirts with fantasy themes.Bruce Willis can't seem to do a film lately without a kid to play opposite.  As was the case with ""Sixth Sense"" and Haley Joel Osment, he works well with Spencer Treat Clark in this film.  The scene where Clark confronts him with a loaded weapon will nail you to the wall.  Willis plays the part just right with a combination of skepticism and curiosity that makes his transition from regular Joe to action hero extremely believable.Samuel L. Jackson knows only one way to play a part and that is flat out.  Once again he delivers, with a darkly enigmatic character that makes the entire mystery work.  Jackson's talent and intensity again makes me wonder why he has only been nominated for one supporting Oscar (""Pulp Fiction"").  Robin Wright Penn rounds out an excellent cast with a solid performance as Willis' wife.For anyone who enjoys a good psychological thriller this film won't disappoint.  I rated it a 9/10.  It will keep you guessing and intrigued throughout.",Unbreakable

I'm not suprised that women haven't liked this movie very much, and I've concluded it is generally a movie for guys. It focuses on a turning point all men face, the transistion from early twenties to adulthood. In our culture, we often neglect questions of identity, and we typically indulge in consumerism as Ed Norton's character does in the beginning. Then comes along Tyler Dirden (Brad Pitt) who challenges Norton's life. Implicit in this is a string of doubts: I was a boy, then a teen, then young, now a man, and that means? where did that go? why did it go? It is like a midlife crisis 10 or 15 years too soon. This movie tries to reinforce that it is better to establish identity than to worry about other people's perceptions. Indeed, the characters go overboard on this, but I doubt most people will go that far. If people just look behind characters' motives and try to see the lingering doubts, the movie becomes far more intelligible and less of a macho bash.",N/A

388417,"I saw this movie because it featured one of my favorite actresses from the early '80s -- the lovely Diane Franklin who is probably best known for a better role in a better movie, Better Off Dead.  Here, Franklin is basically the only sympathetic character as she plays the sweetly virginal younger sister of a teenager who is eventually possessed by Satan and goes on a killing rampage in the house that would later become the setting of the Amityville Horror.  Anyway, as part of that whole possession deal, older brother decides to have an incestous relationship with younger sister and the fact that Franklin, an actress who deserved better, is so shamelessly exploited only serves to make this film even more sickening to sit through.  This is the most loathsome type of horror film -- i.e., the type of film that exists only to introduce a group of characters so that the audience can then get the thrill of watching them sadistically killed off.  That takes place in the first half of the film.  The second half is a blatant rip-off of the Exorcist and isn't any better.  Few other movie genres have the potential power of the horror film and a film like Amityville II serves only to remind us how great these films can be when done with some measure of talent and thought (the original Halloween, the Exorcist, the original Haunting of Hill House, and a few others come to immediate mind).  Still, anyone who enjoys watching little children graphically murdered and innocent girls raped by their brothers should find plenty to enjoy in this film.

295995,"Zoe Tamerlis (also known as Zoe Lund) died a few years back in Paris of an apparent drug overdose.  Even though she'd never be a household name, the actress had a cult following in the States -- largely as a result of her debut film, Abel Ferrara's violent Ms. 45.  Made when she was only seveteen, Ms. 45 stars Tamerlis as Thana, a young, mute woman who works in New York's garment district and spends her days suffering in forced silence as basically every male on the planet either propositions her or taunts her with sexist comments.  (One of the film's more disturbing aspects isn't that not a single positive man makes an appearance but that the male ogres who do show up are all so believable and familiar.)  One day, in a coincidence that points to the film's exploitation roots, Thana is raped twice by two different men in one day.  After the second rape, the mute Thana finally asserts her independence by killing her attacker and from there, the film's plot shifts into high gear.  Thana now starts to roam the streets of New York at night, deliberately enticing men and then, once they respond, gunning them down.  In perhaps the film's most famous scene, Thana dresses up as a sexy nun and takes on a street gang.  Anyway, Thana becomes progressively more and more unhinged (and since this is an Abel Ferrara film, the New York imagery becomes more and more surreal and Hellish) and goes from shooting just potential rapists to any man who crosses her path.  While the plot may make this sound like just another exploitation flick, the film actually has a disturbing intensity to it that makes it, at times, quite disturbing to watch.  Ferrara's direction, while stylized, is also far more realistic than most other exploitation films and Tamerlis's amazing performance keeps the film rooted in a very real sense of pain and danger.  She is the center of the film and she plays every aspect of her character with such force and credibility that its hard not to get sucked into her fractured reality.  And its a reality that stays with you long after the film is over.",N/A
385172,"Alien survivors of a disintegrated galaxy attack the Earth in saucer shaped spaceships armed with death rays. Despite its pulp magazine origins, this film exceeds expectations due to Ray Harryhausen's magical special effects and a literate script. The astonishing stop-motion animation by RH is the real star of the film. The constraints of the B&amp;W photography are a hindrance, but RH rises to the occasion. The only thing missing is a rampaging radioactive beast from outer space. The generic spaceships alone don't satisfy this wish. The aliens are covered by body armor that supports their atrophied muscles and conceal their withered facial features. Things get intense when the spaceships attack Washington. Familiar landmarks and buildings suffer explosive destruction. Conventional military hardware has no effect on the force field protecting the alien craft. Earth people suffer alien abductions, brainwashing, and thought control. McCarthy style, '50s paranoia creeps into the story. The script is otherwise intelligent, and avoids many of the typical cliches. The action moves swiftly along and doesn't waste time on subplots. Fans of Ray Harryhausen's animation definitely need this classic sci-fi flick for their collection. This is great Saturday matinee fun for 12 year old kids of all ages. Enjoy the ride. ;-)",Earth vs the Flying Saucers VHS

395519,"So many people have written about the things that make the Rocky movies so successful, and I have no doubt that I'll be repeating some of them in my review.  But I have to throw my hat in the ring anyway, so to speak.Rocky Balboa certainly qualifies as one of the most unique and determined heroes in cinema.  His story is truly an inspiraton to us all.  In the first movie, of course, he starts out with basically nothing, gets a chance to fight Apollo Creed (Carl Weathers), and loses.  In the second movie, he wins the heavyweight title from Creed in a rematch.  By the third movie, Rocky is basking in the glow of his success; he and Adrienne now have a son.  But Clubber Lang (Mr. T) has been making his way to the top as well, and he challenges Rocky to a match.  Rocky trains hard and tries his best, but his concerns about his manager Mickey's (Burgess Meredith) health make it difficult to concentrate, giving Lang the advantage...and Rocky's title.  With encouragement from Adrienne and his former rival Apollo Creed, who takes over as manager after Mickey's death,  Rocky rediscovers his Eye of the Tiger in the rematch and puts Lang in his place.In the fourth movie, Apollo is killed in battle by Russian champion Ivan Drago (Dolph Lundgren).  In one of the most intense boxing matches of the entire series, Rocky finds the &quot;chink&quot; in the Russian's seemingly impenetrable armor.  It's worth getting the fourth movie just for that match.But, by the time of the fifth and final movie, things are quite a bit different. (As I'm writing this, I've just finished watching the fifth one for the very first time.)  Not only do Rocky and his family find out that they're broke, but Rocky seems to be suffering from brain damage as a result of his fight with Drago. He becomes a manager for a new young fighter, Tommy Gunn (upsetting his son quite a bit), who allows his ego to cloud his judgement, thus luring himself into the sleazy side of the boxing business.  When Tommy gets a shot at the heavyweight title, the audience is already in a bad mood because Rocky isn't there on stage with him.  But when Tommy takes the title in just over three rounds, the audience is REALLY in a bad mood; at least Rocky had class.Rocky and Tommy end up resolving their differences in a street fight, and for several agonizing minutes it looks like it could be the end...but Rocky has the spirit of Mickey with him, and for the fourth time, the Italian Stallion wins, proving that he's still a champion and always will be, even after fifteen years.Whenever I watch these movies I can still feel the excitement of seeing them for the first time.  When the odds are stacked against him, even in the face of several brushes with death (Tommy Gunn makes Ivan Drago and Clubber Lang look like  pussycats somtimes), he still manages to triumph.I love you, Rock...you the man!",Rocky Gift Set VHS
537483,"I saw this film at a mall theatre in the philippines which is most fiting because that country was raped and pillaged by the japanese in the war. Not that historical accuracy means anything in this movie. &quot;Pearl harbor&quot; represents commericalism at it's very worst. Nothing wrong with making a buck but this movie was made and edited in such a way to not offend anybody and great art almost always offends somebody. They didn't want the film to be too patriotic so it wouldn't turn off non americans. They didn't want to portray the japanese too harshly because they wanted the movie to sell there. There had to be a really stupid sappy love story to appeal to the teeny bobbers the way titanic did. So much effort was placed in this movie to appeal the the maximum number of people that nothing is left of redeeming value. Why bother to watch a movie about this most important historical event that cares little for history or patriotism? But they did manage to offend some people. Veterans of world war two and most veteran groups find this film offensive and many recommend that the movie be boycotted. I agree.Now even a misguided movie like this can provide some entertainment. Mississippi burning was a similarly misguided movie but it had some value because of the classic good v evil story line and a great performance by gene hackman. That's not the case here. Both leading men are terribly unconvincing and ben affleck's rafe(rafe?) was comletely dull. Kate beckinsale gives the best performance considering how shallow her character is written. Fact is the writing for the whole film is pathetic. The love story is dumber than dumb as beckinsale's squeeze rafe, gets shot down in europe and is presumed dead. Naturally ben's best buddy(played by josh hannah) moves in and knocks up beckinsdale just before our hunky leading man shows up not so dead after all. And we're supposed to care? Don't worry though because this moronic love story only consumes 2 hours of the movie. That's all.Then we get to that little incidental event of the japanese attack. The action portrayed isn't bad and you can't help but be relieved to see the story move in another direction. Our two studly heros forget about their tense romantic conflict just long enough to hop in a couple of planes and kick some butt while beckinsale and her babe nurse cohorts save lives below. It's all so exciting. When the dust clears 3000 americans are dead but you won't be moved because of the plastic video game presentation.Now apparently mr. bay et al fiqured the movie was lacking at this point so they decided on depicting dolittle's raid on tokyo. Dolittle is depicted by that great patriot himself alec baldwin whose performance isn't too bad. Again history is a little fuzzy here but it provides our heroic leading men an opportunity to be, well, heroic. Unfortunately the josh harnett character doesn't survive the attack and we are supposed to feel sad. Don't worry you won't. Great movies make you feel something. The only thing you will feel from watching this movie is that you wish you didn't waste your hard earned money on it. Titanic was the main blue print for this film. Take a love story and entwine it with a real life tragedy. Titanic suceeded because there were some real gut wrenching moments. Not in &quot;pearl harbor&quot;. As for beckindale and afflecks romance? Well they get back together of course. And Ben, rafe,(rafe?) agrees to raise his buddy's kid. Why should anyone care?Finally there is one good thing about this film. The music is great and the faith hill theme song is quite good......................socks",N/A

538342,"It's hard to imagine the premise of this film happening in real life...a young woman devotes an entire month of her life to helping the lives of complete strangers. Or, to put it mildly, she takes a new lover every month. Nelson (Keanu Reeves) is, at the start of the film, obsessed with one thing...himself. He's selfish, arrogant, and a workaholic. Sara (Charlize Theron) is a free spirit who decides that Nelson needs her ""help."" Over the course of the month, we see Nelson transformed into a lovesick sweetie (he even sings for Sara, and I was blown away...Keanu Reeves can sing, and sing well!) The month ends, but Nelson doesn't want the relationship to. He tries his hardest to win Sara over and make her forget about her ""one month only"" rule, but Sara has a secret that forces her to stick to her rule, and it's this secret that is the most devastating to Nelson. Keanu & Charlize are good together, and the film has some tender moments, but the end was a letdown for me. As far as Keanu's role goes, he seemed more comfortable in the role of laid-back nice guy instead of the arrogant person that he started out as. Of course, I will never have anything bad to say about him, as I worship the ground he walks on. Charlize gives a fine performance, as well. Frank Langella has a juicy bit part as a man who is so nasty and cold, it gave me chills, and he must have given Nelson the chills, too, because we see in his eyes a slight change as he sees in Langella what he doesn't want to become. Also, look for the lovely Lauren Graham (TV's ""Gilmore Girls) as Nelson's girlfriend, Angelica. All in all, a very sweet, touching, and sad film with wonderful performances.",N/A

569486,"The original book was the story of one trooper, Rico, and his journey to manhood in the Mobile Infantry of the 23rd century.  Rico was an archtypical grunt, or &quot;ape&quot;, no more special or important to the war effort than any other ape.  He was not particularly heroic or important to the outcome of the war.  The movie version was rightly criticized as &quot;Beverly Hills 90120 meets The Jetsons.&quot;  A banal love triangle with excessive gore and Nazification of Heinlein's concept of the World Federation.  The director made a comic strip out of the book.This version is closer to the original but shows the influence of the movie.  There's still a love triangle, there's still blood and gore (not as much as in the movie) but it's more a story about the ordinary soldiers who fight and die in any war, regardless of the century, technology, or enemy.  Brilliant, ground breaking CGI with color and texture far greater than needed in a morning cartoon show.  The production suffered when one of the 2 companies hired to do the CGI couldn't finish its work and the other's schedule suffered as a result; that's why the episodes were shown out of order, with numerous repeats, and Fridays pre-empted all the time.  This cost the show the last 2 episodes of the season that would wrapped up most of the cliffhangers.  SST:R ended with a disappointed fanbase and leaving many threads open.  Unfortunately it doesn't look like they'll ever revisit it.  But still well worth the watch.",N/A

Years later, two US Marshal's were killed in the area, and the town ended up in the national spotlight when the FBI converged into it searching for Gorden Kahl, who puportedly was hiding in the town after the killings.This story appeals to me because of that, and because of the slow, yet building work up of the characters throughout the movie.Two kids named Sam and Michael move into their grandfathers home in a town they  know nothing about.  During their stay they find out that many children are missing, presumed runaways by the authorities, and no one seems to be too interested in finding out the truth.  But, in the turn of events they discover the truth.The star that shines in this film is Kiefer Sutherland, an initially dark character, seemingly in love with his motorcycle, and viciously protecting his claim on his girlfriend.  He is a bully, as are his motorcycle friends.  As we find out that, while they remain bullies, they have the &quot;advantage&quot; of being vampires to add to their criminal behavior.Director Joel Schumacher took this movie, which could have been just a standard &quot;B&quot; fare, run in the mill teen horror picture, and rose it up to be funny, dark, and exciting.Recommended for all of you conspiracy theory nuts and vampire fans.",N/A
537477,"To coincide with the 6oth anniversary of the sneak Japanese attack against American assets, the Disney machine releases the two-disc &quot;PEARL HARBOR&quot; (Touchstone), it's gargantuan recreation of the horrific incident that sealed our involvement in WW II.Set against a sophomoric and predictable love triangle (Ben Afflect, Josh Hartnett and Kate Beckinsdale), the stunning CGI enhanced invasion and the heartstopping flying sequences are all the more impressive. The Disney team had high hopes of duplicating the success of &quot;Titanic&quot; with what they thought were the same key ingredients but on an even larger scale. But alas, the critics and public did not respond in kind.What made &quot;Titanic&quot; so universally popular had to do with the idea of seeking love in a perfect world that suddenly is doomed.

269044,"""The Robots of Death"" is a well-remembered 1977 ""Doctor Who"" adventure heavy on the gothic horror favored by the show at that time. Within another year or two, the program would return to funny monsters in ill-fitting costumes, but you won't see that here.  ""Robots"" is a logical, if unsexy choice, to be the first Tom Baker/Fourth Doctor story released on DVD.Because the story is 24 years old, some of the special features are a stretch. Most compelling to US audiences is the featurette on Howard DaSilva, who provided cheezy and sarcastic voiceovers for the show when it was first aired State-side. Oddly, no photo of Howard is provided, but his lines are so amusing you'll play them often enough to wear out that sector of the disc.The long, mute, test model shots of the story's ""Sandminer"" vessel, try the patience.  Many blockbuster movies like to load their DVDs with technical features, demonstrating the magic of filmmaking. While the Sandminer shots remain impressive for a small-budget show, perhaps the DVD space may have been better reserved for more informative feature, such as one about Louise Jameson (Leela), who appeared in so few DW stories.The key feature is the commentary track by producer Philip Hinchcliffe (often credited with the show's 1970s success), and episode writer Chris Boucher. Hinchcliffe relays a few anecdotes about working with Tom Baker, but by and large the two spend the first half of the story (which neither had seen since 1977) ignoring what happens on screen, and the second half so caught up in events that the commentary nearly stops!  Hinchcliffe also keeps comparing this 1977 adventure favorably to today's big-budget Hollywood films. Well, yes.. the DVDs cost the same. However, the title of this review (spoken by Hinchcliffe, about guest-actor Russell Hunter) is more than worth the price.The copy-editing on the actor biographies is poor. Louise Jameson's TV credits are the same as Tom Baker's, and oddly omitted is the credit guest-star David Collings' biggest role, Bob Cratchit in the 1970 ""Christmas Carol"".Most important to the DVD is of course ""The Robots of Death"" themselves, and happily this story is worth your time.",Doctor Who - Robots of Death VHS
532559,"........you're about 10 years old!ok - first - the ad campaigns are terribly misleading.  this isn't a ""change your life""/""i had a near-death-experience and massive awakening"" movie; if you go into it expecting this you will be sorely disappointed.  instead, this is a more serious type of *batman* or *superman* flick with a morose, monotone, somber, melodramatic superhero sans the exaggerations of ""supernatural"" powers and strength.in other words this is a comic book on film - and little more.  really, that's the straight scoop on this flick; i kid you not!the acting is good all around, considering that the mood of this film is droll and dreary throughout - i think there was ONE joke in the entire film; aside from that all of the characters bore the same overly serious expression.  (did any of the characters actually crack a smile at all??)there could have been so much more to this movie had it been taken in the *fearless*/*awakenings*/*the game*/*cast away* direction.  but alas it was not.and the ending - it is absolutely preposterous and mathematically ludicrous.  it makes no sense - either in its conception or in the fact that it ACTUALLY worked out from the character's perspective!!  but .......... if you keep in mind that this is basically a comic book on film, then the ending may be a bit easier to swallow.on a positive note, i am forever grateful to M. Night Shyamalan for only taking 1:40 minutes to tell this story.  if this had been stretched out to 3 hours like *the green mile* or *magnolia* i would have to write a seriously disparaging review and subtract stars, etc., etc.  but as it is it's a two-star movie with a lame ending that only wastes 1:40 minutes of your life and offers a few interesting ideas as compensation (unlike *the green mile* or *magnolia* which had no redeeming qualities at all - can you tell how much i hated these movies? ...",Unbreakable

114409,"There are three sci-fi film essentials: Fritz Lang's ""Metropolis,""  ""The Day the Earth Stood Still,"" and ""Forbidden Planet.""  There three films defined science fiction, as we know it today.  ""Forbidden Planet,"" for example, is the father of the Star Trek franchise, and the sets provided the basis for ""Lost in Space.""  And look at all of Robby the Robots grandchildren!This film is a science fiction rewrite of  ""The Tempest,"" which helps explain its sticking power.  It has the rescue vessel, the mad scientist, and the alien mysteries, all of which capture your interest and never let you go. IT has elements of a murder mystery, with hilarious subplots about a nave young girl and hungry boys lucked up in psace for a year.  IS it 1950's cheese?  Yes, but it is fun to watch.The killer is an invisible villain.  Aside from being cheaper, this builds the suspense to an incredible level.  Come on-you see ""Alien"" and you see a lanky guy in a rubber suit. But an invisible villain lets your imagination run wild, which can be wilder than anything Hollywood can ever make.The situation of a scientific-research vessel that discovers now life and new civilization provides the pattern for Star Trek:  the main characters being the Captain, the ship's doctor and the engineer interacting.  Leslie Neilson has the same soul as William Shatner.  For good or bad, there is no Star Trek equivalent of Robby the Robot, unless you count Mr. Spock.  But I digress.Another observation is Altair's insidious wardrobe changing, which preempts Queen Amildala by five decades.  Walter Pidgeon gives a masterful performance, and steals the show.  So many mad scientists are flat and soulless-they are even passionless went it comes to their passions in science.  But Pidgeon breathes life in what could have been a cheesy 1950's science fiction throwaway.The costuming and sets are superb.  True this is 1950, so some of the sets look like they were done with Crayolas, but can any ""cockpit hold the vasty fields of France?""  The doorways in the film give you the weird impression of alien civilization. The lab and Krell building blow your mind with all of the gizmos. Nothing specific, but the overall atmosphere suggests things alien.  I wonder if they actually had an image of the Krell, or if they just made it up as they went along the image you see haloed in laser-fire may be a Krell, or may be the Krell equivalent of a Frankenstein's monster.  The plaster cast of the monster's foot suggests that the monster is an imaginary composite, but we will never know. By the way, the idea that a civilization would not have pictures is not weird ay all-Islamic art does not allow for graven images to be made, so they focus on Arabic calligraphy.  .The soundtrack is theremin based-the eerie ""oooh""-making machine from the Beach Boy's song ""Good Vibrations.""  It adds to the weirdness of the movie, and is comparable to the soundtrack in the 1981 remake of  ""Flash Gordon.""  Most experimental soundtracks flop, but this comes off perfectly, since it is suggested that the music we a re listening to is actually Krell music.The DVD is an annoying two-sided disc with letterbox and ""pan and scan"" on each side.  People-Wide screen, wide screen, wide screen!Two parting thoughts:First, at the heart of this movie is a psycho-thriller that brings your mind to the edge as you are forced to look at yourself.  We have the technology and the power to be gods, but can we stand it if in our hearts, we are devils?

Kurt Russell was okay (he's starting to show his age a bit), and I enjoyed Courtney Cox's trailer park ingenue a lot...but the reason to see this movie is, believe it or not, Kevin Costner.The best comparison I can make to this radically-against-type casting of him in this movie is when Henry Fonda put on a black hat for Sergio Leone's &quot;Once Upon A Time In The West&quot;. You just don't expect to see a typically romantic lead in role like this. And Costner nails it with a vengeance. He smokes. He steals things. He kills more-or-less everything in his path. Worse still for these politically-correct times, he drinks and drives and fills out sex questionnaires in magazines. He really makes this otherwise cookie cutter action flick work. The film itself will serve to provide additional ammunition for Costner bashers everywhere (you know who you are), but that's unfortunate, because his performance here is absolutely outstanding. It's worth at least a rental...and if you're a fan of either Costner or action flicks, it's certainly worth owning.",3000 Miles to Graceland
522394,"I am a huge action fan, love most of Tom Cruise's movies, and loved the first Mission:Impossible movie.  However, this one is not on par with that movie by any stretch of the imagination.  I actually thought of giving this movie 1 star, but some of the action and visual effects were stunning, so that boosted my score.The film starts out brilliantly, and the mountain scene was breathtaking.  It all goes downhill from there...  I really think John Woo is off his rocker.  In the commentary in one of the special features on the DVD, he says he wanted to direct a love story.  Good try buddy!  And the action scenes were overdone and unrealistic.  I am impressed that Cruise did most of his stunts, but some of the stuff was just stupid, like the cartwheel kick at the end.  Can you actually tell me that someone would not be able to get out of the way?  They should have just stuck with a realistic fight scene, where the blows would actually hurt in real life.  This was further worsened by the slo-mo that was used constantly.  At least at regular speed it may have looked somewhat believable.Despite the problems I had with some of the action scenes, the worst part of the movie had to do with all the masks that were used.  I mean, how believable is it that Cruise kept a mask of his face, as well as a mask of each of the bad guys?  Added to that, who would believe that it was the same guy?  Remember, Cruise is short...at least three inches shorter than Dougray Scott.  Anybody would've been able to pick up on this...I am just so frustrated because they really wasted what could have been a good sequel.  Do yourself a favor and buy Mission:Impossible.  Rent MI:2 only if you want to laugh at the garbage that John Woo made.",N/A

Ever notice how serial killers in these types of movies want to get caught, try to get and at the end of the movie, get caught??  The director of this movie had this meticulous serial killer who planned everything out.  Then, the killer becomes sloppy and any old girl would do.  Garbage.  I guess if you can't find anything you have not seen yet you should watch this.  But, don't buy it.",The Watcher
81518,"Muriel Heslop is a young woman who dreams of getting married and moving far away from her boring life in Porpoise Spit, Australia. Unfortunately, even after her dreams do come true (and changes her name to Mariel), she discovers that while she has gained everything she has desired, she has also alienated herself from her family and her best friend Rhonda, and by the end of the film goes back to being good-ol' Muriel Heslop.The performances in this film were excellent, especially Toni Collette in the lead (who gained a few pounds for her role), and future Oscar nominee Rachel Griffiths as Rhonda, a woman suddenly sticken with a potentially fatal illness.Despite it's seemingly simple plot, it's a suprisingly rich and complex story. It's about a family on the verge of insanity, the value of friendship, and is a fable with a positive message: Be yourself, and you will like yourself for it.Whether you like comedy or drama, you'll absolutely fall in love with this movie.",N/A
116626,"This is one of only two movies that I have ever seen THREE times in the theater...and, since I bought it on DVD a year ago, I have probably seen it a total of at least 10 times by now.  It is a movie that draws you in, not just with its mind-boggling special effects, but also with its underlying story.  The story is so neatly woven into it all, and the whole film is so fast-paced, that on first (or even third) viewing, it's difficult to be able to follow it all.  Sorry, all you &quot;dissenters&quot; out there, but if you didn't like this film, then you obviously just didn't get it.I'm a relatively smart moviegoer, but I did not totally get all the details in the entire movie myself, the first few times around.  I loved it the very first time I saw it, and I knew that it was a great, groundbreaking film.  But honestly, I got maybe about 40% of what was going on.  I began to lose track of what was happening after Neo takes the red pill.  Fortunately, this movie works on so many levels, that it can even be enjoyed on the level of a high-tech, high-kickin', sci-fi-action thriller.  But something about this film intrigued me so much, the way &quot;The X-Files&quot; on TV used to intrigue me.The second time I saw THE MATRIX, I was up to about 60% in my understanding of it.  At this point, I got most of the major details, (like what happens after Neo takes the red pill) but I still didn't fully understand exactly what the agents, or the sentinels, were.  On my thrid viewing, I finally got this point, but I wouldn't say that I got 100% of it--I got maybe up to 90%.  But everytime I have seen it since, it adds something new to my understanding of the incredible world of THE MATRIX.  This is the mark of a GREAT FILM:  One that makes you want to come back for more, even when you don't understand everything in it, and gives you something new every single time you see it.THE MATRIX was great to see in the theater, but it is an even greater experience on DVD.  It was cool on the big screen, but on DVD the film is much sharper (it almost makes you think that your TV set is HDTV), and it has all the great extras that you would expect from a DVD--plus many great ones that you WOULDN'T expect.  Besides the great behind-the-scenes documentary &quot;HBO First Look: Making the Matrix,&quot; you get the incredible feature &quot;Take the red pills to view two hidden special effects documentaries: &quot;What is Bullet Time?&quot; and &quot;What is the Concept?&quot;&quot; which delves much more into what the special effects are and how they are accomplished.  Plus, there is the feature that allows you to see the film and, at certain points, a &quot;white rabbit&quot; pops up on the lower right-hand corner of the screen.  If you click &quot;ENTER&quot; on your remote while the white rabbit is up on the screen, you get taken to a mini-behind-the-scenes-featurette on exactly how they made that particular scene (this is NOT taken out of the HBO behind-the-scenes feature.  It's pretty incredible!  Of course, the Commentary by Carrie-Anne Moss, editor Zach Staenberg and visual effects supervisor John Gaeta is also very cool. Overall, it's like nothing I've ever seen before.  I can't wait for THE MATRIX 2, or whatever its title will be, to come out!!Bottom line to all this: If you loved the movie, you'll go ga-ga over the DVD!!!!",N/A

93773,"In 1995, Director David Fincher joined Morgan Freeman and Brad Pitt inthe years most disgusting, tense and talked about films.  Seven is alook into a persons liking for gore and blood, all done through thetheme of the 7 deadly sins.  Unlike Fight Club, another Fincher film,Seven was made right before the DVD format was introduced.  Theinitial release of Seven on DVD was less then spectacular.  The NewLine Platinum series is visually one of the most stunning releases tocome along in a while.  Sonically, this release will surround you withsound elements of such clarity and depth, it may seem too real attimes.  The 2 disc package is similar to the Fight Club package.  Ithas two nicely designed discs in an attractive package.  The menudesign on the discs are very impressive.  What may seem confusing atfirst becomes quickly understandable and easy to navigate throughout.Disc 1 has the movie along with commentary by David Fincher, MorganFreeman and Brad Pitt.  It also has commentary by the Screenwriter,the Editor, a Professor of Film Studies and the new Line President ofProduction.  These commentaries are very insightful, informative andentertaining to listen to.  The scene selections are nice, shown withstill pictures and a title of each sequence.  Disc 1 also has a simple'color bars' setup.  Picture quality of this movie is outstanding tosay the least, especially if you compare this release with theprevious DVD release.  The original negative was used this time, andthe darkness of this film has never looked so incredibly clear.Contrast and colors are beautiful...not too saturated for this type offilm, but quite stunning.  Sharpness is well executed throughout thefilm and I found it hard to see any grain or dirt on the picture.This is obviously a first class transfer and the anamorphic widescreenpicture is superb.  Sound quality is even more amazing.  When you goto your setup in the menu, you have a choice of English or Frenchsubtitles.  You also have a choice of stereo Surround Sound, Dolby EXSurround Sound or DTS ES Surround Sound.  Whatever type of system youhave, this film shines.  If you have a surround system with a greatsubwoofer, you will not believe your ears.  This film has been rebuiltfrom the ground up and remixed for DVD.  Effects elements andatmospheric sound effects will simply blow your mind.  Dialogue isclean and clear.  The sound department responsible for this soundtrackshould be applauded.  They did a superb job.  Disc 2 has a bunch ofextras that will keep you busy for quite a while.  The first extra onthe disc is an &quot;exploration of the opening title sequence.&quot;You get to choose from different angles and different audio optionswhile watching this sequence.  You can watch an early storyboarddrawing of the title sequence, a rough version of the opening and thefinal version of the opening title sequence.  You can choose from asurround mix, a Dolby EX mix that was made just for this DVD, or ahigh quality 24bit/96Khz stereo mix.  It's amazing how many optionsyou get to pick from just to watch something about the opening titlesequence!  You can also listen to commentary by designer Kyle Cooperor the Sound Engineers Brent Biles and Robert Margouleff.  Wow!  Thenext pick on Disc 2 is where you get to see &quot;Deleted Scenes&quot;and &quot;Extended Takes&quot; from the film, all with or withoutDavid Finchers commentary.  There are seven scenes to choose from andare all fascinating to watch while listening to the commentary.  Thenext pick on Disc 2 are the &quot;Alternate Endings.&quot; You haveyour choice of the original &quot;test&quot; ending with or withoutDavid Finchers commentary.  You also can look at an animatedstoryboard of an unshot ending.  This was done really well and bothoffer subtle differences and insight into the ending that is in thefilm.  Next, you can look at a bunch of Production Design stills withcommentary.  This was also done very well, considering how amazing theProduction Design really is for this film.  You next have choices of abunch of other still photographs from the film, including John Doe'sphotographs, Victor's decomposition, police crime scene photographsand production photographs.  These come all with commentary, and thisis the first disc where I actually enjoyed still photos on aDVD....very well done.  Another choice you have on Disc 2 is called'The Notebooks.&quot; This is a very informative sequence of stillswith commentary on how those infamous notebooks were created.  Whenyou choose &quot;Promotional Materials,&quot; you can watch thetheatrical EPK or the movie trailer.  As with most DVD's, you canchoose &quot;Filmographies&quot; where you can see the resume's of allthe actors and many crew members.  Finally, for all you technicalpeople out there, you can choose &quot;Mastering for the HomeTheatre.&quot; This is a fantastic look into the film to videotransfer of Seven, as well as the color correcting, telecine, audiomastering and mixing of Seven for the theatre as well as the remixingfor the DVD.  All are played with scenes from the film comparing thelast release and this release of Seven.  The commentary is botheducational and entertaining to listen to.  In conclusion, Seven is amust have DVD.  Picture quality is outstanding.  Audio quality isfantastic, and the extras are wonderful.  If you loved Seven in themovies, or want to replace your old DVD release with this one, buySeven and prepare yourself for 2 hours of amazement.  If you are alover of crime thrillers then get this disc. If you enjoy MorganFreeman, Brad Pitt or David Fincher then get this disc.  It would be asin NOT to get this DVD! Enjoy!",Seven
247583,"i really love this film (it's pointless to argue whether or not it's fellini's best), and it's a nice complement to the recently rereleased &quot;8 1/2&quot;: in that film an alienated male protagonist discovers his deep connection to other people, while in &quot;juliet&quot; a housebound female discovers her uniqueness, and separateness from other people. masina is splendid in the title role, attractive yet mousy, yielding yet strong, and she captures the stages of disillusionment, denial, pain, wandering and final clarity with incredible directness. her final liberation, as she walks alone out of her prim garden and into a stately mysterious forest, is a beautiful affirmation. this is also a film where fellini's elliptical, dreamlike techniques work extremely well to increase rather than diffuse the mood of tension and pain. the ample sandra milo is amusingly sexy as the free spirited neighbor, and some of the cut footage mentioned by other viewers include her &quot;over the top&quot; costume scenes. i hope the new theatrical release restores the original version (which i saw as a teenager in the late '60s), as this often precedes an authoritative dvd release. but despite the cuts and the annoying white on white subtitles, this is a film to treasure in any format you can find it.",N/A

483142,"Nashville is one of the most interesting, intelligent and compelling movies to ever come out of Hollywood. Featuring bravura performances from each of the 24 main characters, it is a brilliant examination of American society, politics, religion, showbusiness and culture. This 157 minute film tackles all of these issues at a steady pace (the director's control is absolutely superb), leading up to a shattering denouement. Despite being made in 1976, Nashville still packs a hell of a punch - its themes are still relevant today.The eponymous setting of the movie is synonymous with politics. From the start of the movie, a campaign wagon for a presidential candidate drives all over the town spewing political slogans and ideals to the residents: this wagon links all of the characters together. As Robert Altman follows it, he focuses on all of Nashville's protagonists using brief vignettes that each tell a short story of their own - gradually, all of these characters intertwine and eventually, converge on the eve of a political rally.Each of these vignettes are so concise, so telling in their exposition of the character, that the viewer almost immediately fathoms an understanding of what each protagonist is like. Who to fear; who to admire; who to respect; who to pity. Altman peppers the movie with over one hour of music - after all, Nashville is the home of country/western. The lyrics ring true with certain characters and elicit emotional responses from the viewer. ""We [Americans] must be doing something right to last two hundred years,"" sings one character at the start of the movie - later on, scenes that show a woman forced to strip, as well as a shooting, deliver a sharp ring of irony to the lyric.All of the performances in the movie are brilliant, the most notable of which is Lily Tomlin. She is especially good as the mother of two deaf children, all the while struggling with her marriage. Her husband makes no effort to translate his deaf son's story of swimming lessons: ""what's he sayin'?"" he asks. Her sorrow translates beautifully to the screen with the help of Nashville's score. Each actor conveys their character's emotions to the viewer with relative ease, which consequently heightens understanding and compels the viewer to watch on with interest. Because the viewer can connect with each of the characters, the finale is that much more heartbreaking.  Ultimately, Nashville is a brilliant character study of epic scope and proportions. The technical brilliance behind the movie in conjunction with the excellent performances culminates to create one of the most rewarding and intelligent movies in motion picture history. Nashville leaves the viewer with one clear impression: each of us, whether we like it or not, are part of a society that is both good and bad - behind all the politics, the foul play and the heartbreak, we can still manage to carve out an existence of sorts, and ultimately be happy.",Nashville
263296,"TONY ROME, if you had noticed, is not a Republic Pictures B detective movie.  It's up a grade or two with a dashing good script and . . . WHAT a cast!

Well, maybe not in Charlie Chan's class, a gumshoe who never laid a bookie bet as Tony Rome often does.

You just can't help enjoying Sinatra's laid back style. Yeh! I think younger folks could handle this film. The language is unsmutty.  The sex is rather subtle and nothing naughty goes on in the back seat of Sinatra's Ford-bulls-eye-tail-lites convertible The violence is certainly minimal by today's standards. For example, my wife at the finish asked, &quot;Has he killed only three people?&quot; Actually, I counted about five.

514955,"This special Christmas installment of the sensational 1963-1964 ""Judy Garland Show"" is quite possibly the best of the series.  For anybody who can remember watching this program when it originally aired on CBS-TV on Sunday night, December 22, 1963, I'm guessing that each one of you has a bit of a lump in your throat when re-watching this excellent DVD today, because you can no doubt recall very vividly the times in which it aired for the first time:  exactly one month after our President (John F. Kennedy) had been killed in Dallas.This Garland entry was then (and probably still is) kind of a bittersweet memory, coming so close to one of America's worst tragedies in our history. I can feel some of 1963 come right through the screen when I watch this Christmas show.  It's just THERE, and it comes through (at least for me).Judy and company do a standout job in comforting a distressed nation during this 1-hour party. Guests Jack Jones and Mel Torme are also on hand to add to the festive atmosphere, along with Judy's three children, Liza, Joe, and Lorna.I know from reading various books that Christmas time was indeed very special to the Garland clan....and that fact really shines through during this program!  The love these 4 had for one another is very evident.  This point is driven home with force at the very end of this show, when Judy sits down, with pajama-clad Joe & Lorna by her side, and sings ""Over The Rainbow"", with the two kids snuggling ever-closer to their famous mom.  A great end to a fine Christmas treat.This program shines on DVD, but don't entirely dismiss the idea of getting this great show on VHS tape as well. The VHS version looks pretty good too (considering, of course, the limitations that exist on that video format).Plus -- the ""LaserLight"" VHS edition (with the red box and the holly & berries on the cover) contains the original CBS-TV commercials that aired on the December night the show was broadcast for the first time in 1963. The VHS running time is 59 minutes, so you know nothing has been cut at all.  The inclusion of the TV ads, in my opinion, is a good one. Being able to see the old TV commercials of the era brings back even more memories of the 1960s. The DVD version does not have these commercials included. But, of course, the DVD's picture quality is better than the VHS.Judy Garland's legend and enormous talent lives on with Pioneer Artists' splendid series of DVD-Video programs spotlighting this one-of-a-kind superstar.

384776,"This is an underrated gem from Sidney Lumet. This film could very easily have departed from its ultimately brilliant course, and been turned into an overblown, over-the-top, unrealistic &quot;Doomsday&quot; farce.  But Lumet holds on to reality and presents us with a very realistic, and quite frightening look at what could possibly happen if one of our bombers should get a false message to attack Moscow. Henry Fonda is totally believable as the U.S. President trying to avert a catastrophe. And check out a young pre-&quot;I Dream of Jeannie&quot; Larry Hagman as the Russian interpreter! I liked Larry very much in this role.  He, like everyone else in this good cast, remains completely realistic and believable.

80237,"From the first time I saw this feature back in the '50s, I have loved it most of all...there is so much here that is reminiscent of the Golden Times of childhood, what a special time it is and how fleeting...the idea that one can choose not to grow up at all, but live as a perennial child in a place of beauty, some danger, although not real danger, just enough to keep things interesting, and adventures and wonderful spots throughout the island to visit, is a universally appealing one. The music is perfectly suited to this vision of Halcyon days gone by, from the favorite &quot;I Can Fly&quot; to &quot;The Pirate Song&quot; to &quot;What Makes the Red Man Red&quot; to the Lullaby that Wendy sings to the Lost Boys, it's just wonderfully evocative and captures the mood of each moment perfectly.The opening shot that slowly zooms in to the Darling house is fabulous, as is the extraordinary detail of the house itself; I notice something different every time I see it. The animators built an exact miniature of the house down to the smallest detail and fixtures, etc, to aid them in their drawing, and this attention to detail and quality are very apparent throughout.The voices, from Bobby Driscoll as Peter to Kathryn Beaumont as Wendy are wonderfully voiced, very believable without being cloying or self conscious, real kids having real adventures.The colors are so various and rich it stuns the eye, as does the shot of the Island of Never Never Land, the first time we see it, from high above, the Pirate Ship anchored in the harbor, Mermaid Lagoon, the Indian Camp, etc, it is SO beautiful and amazing that they (the animators) were so astute in their picture of a child's fantasy, their own island of adventures. The interaction between Captain Hook and the Crocodile is very funny, as is the byplay with Hook and Smee, the bumbling, endearing servant to the Captain. Tinker Bell is great as the jealous, somewhat snippy fairy who accompanies Pan wherever he goes and displays loyalty of the first order, being willing to sacrifice her life for his.I also love the animal outfits worn with great joy by the Lost Boys, who are a fascinating group in their own right. Despite all the fun and adventure, the Darling children opt to return to their own home and Pan obliges them in yet another visually stunning scene when Tinkerbell transforms the Pirate Ship into a thing of beauty by showering it completely with golden fairy dust.When they have been safely deposited back into their room, the Darlings return from their party just in time to see Peter sailing across the night sky in the wonderful Pirate Ship, which travels across the Moon on a sea of clouds...Wendy, Mr. and Mrs. Darling watch from the Nursery window, and we leave them there, a family, happy and united in their wonderment, the adults and the child, together in their memories of a wonderful chapter of Youth Eternal, as all remember their own experiences with Peter Pan, the boy of Youth and Joy forever.",N/A
28741,"Dumb and Dumber is one of the most entertaining movies of all time, and one of Jim Carrey's finest works. The heart-wrenching story of a man and his best friend going on a journey to find a woman in order to return her bag to her won't bring a tear to your eye, but it will definately make you laugh. Jeff Daniels, an actor who isn't considered by most people as funny, does a grear job in this movie as the dumb one of the two, this is obvious when he and Carrey are attempting to read a newspaper. The dumber of the two, Jim Carrey, provides more laughs than ever, and a huge collection of new jokes.  As with most comedy movies, this movie isn't judged by the quality of the story, but rather the quality and quantity of its jokes. This movie's story is actually not too bad.

In the film, Bruce Willis (currently the brooding lead of such films as &quot;Unbreakable&quot;) is a smart-mouthed New York cop who visits Los Angeles to attend a Christmas party at a building where his wife is working.  &quot;Terrorists&quot; arrive to spoil the preceedings, leaving Willis alone, exhausted, barefoot, and the only one who can stop them.  Despite it's numerous and carbon-copy immitators, &quot;Die Hard&quot; is a great action epic, and it's displayed quite nicely in this new 5-star DVD release.  First off, you get two audio commentaries: one with director John McTiernan and production designer Jackson DeGovia explaining the difficulties of starting a movie that DIDN'T have a ending set in stone and filming in a studio-owned building, and a second one with visual effects supervisor Richard Edlund explaining some technical aspects of the film and the secret behind Bruce Willis' &quot;barefoot&quot; performance.  A text commentary (like the text commentary on &quot;The Abyss&quot; DVD) is also available where the film is analyzed through numerous interviews with the actors, producers, and film critics.  On the second disc, there's a good amount of stuff to keep you busy.  There's a deleted scene (also on the first disc) and some outtakes, trailers, TV ads, articles on the film, the script (NOT just in DVD-ROM form), and a slick little treat called &quot;The Cutting Room&quot;.  Here, you can see how elements work in some of the big scenes in this film by either changing takes or playing with the sound.

529460,"Well, it's a just a bunch of guys talking about women. They're all players, and they share their exploits--except for the married guy, who's a foil to the others. It's kind of a stuipd premise, and most of the scenes are pretty obvious and not funny.Predictably, they all end-up involved with the same girl (Mia, played by the super-cute Amanda Peet). The execution of that twist is well-done and works to inject interesting irony under the humor. But that's really the only thing going in the whole plot. The conflict development happens a little bit late in the movie, which makes it something of a slow start. (Just a little. I mean, it's not as a bad as &quot;Snow Falling on Cedars&quot;.)The to-the-camera narratives are done out-of-context of the movie, which makes them plausible and less awkward than in most other movies that try this silly technique. And since they're less awkward, they come off as a little bit more insightful.The plot resolution is a little ambiguous, and kind of sudden. But the movie examines the aftermath very deeply, and that's where it makes its point; that's where the real curve ball comes out.",Whipped
421576,"The second sequel to Die Hard, Die Hard 3 doesn't top the original, but definetly delivers a few laughs and some great acion sequences. Bruce Willis, who reprises his role as John McClane, has to do whatever Simon (a madman played by Jeremy Irons) says or he'll blow up a public place. Along to help McClane is Zeus (Samuel L. Jackson) the third and last of the male leads. Although the plot gets a lot more complicated and is full of different twists and turns, I not going to tell you anymore because I'll be giving away the whole movie.Although Die Hard 3 doesn't have nearly as much action as the first two, it does deliver hilarious dialouge (courtesy of Sameuel L.

For example, there is metro train explosion, a car chase, a bloody elevator shootout, a trip down the watery aqueduct tunnels, a pleasant drive through the park, a little side trip to a huge boat, and a helicopter shootout.

This time, McTiernan decided to all out and make the film take place in a whole city instead of a building.

290331,"An antique curio from 1931 which is made watchable out of basic curiousity more than anything else. The incredible Helen Hayes won an AA for this - her first film role. Based upon THE LULLABY, Helen is naive and simple as the innocent young country girl in love with (God help us all) Neil Hamilton (remember the hammy inspector Gordon on BATMAN?). It's a story (more complex than most - in a MADAME X vein) about mother love and self-sacrifice. Madelon becomes a kept woman who gets involved with a lurid scandal -and does time - eventually she takes a walk down the primrose path. The make-up used to age Hayes is astonishingly realistic, but it's Hayes's acting expertise (even at the age of 31) which makes one believe that she's an elderly person - her voice, gestures and inflections are amazing to observe. Madelon's little boy grows up to a highly esteemed doctor (he's played by the 24-year-old Robert Young).  Marie Prevost plays Helen's pal Rosalie and she's memorable as the common little tart with a heart. The unfortunate Prevost (her good friend was Joan Crawford) was a pathetic creature.  A weight problem denied her roles in pictures and she was found dead in 1937 of malnutrition in a seedy room half eaten by her dog.  There was a modest cheque found in her dresser endorsed by none other than Joan Crawford.",Sin of Madelon Claudet VHS
210725,"FRIDAY THE 13TH is, in my opinion, the greatest slasher movie of all time, and my favortie movie of all time.  It set the standard for the horror of the 80's to follow, and it's the type of movie that still scares you all these years later.  Loaded with atmosphere, suspense, and fun setpieces, FRIDAY THE 13TH is a classic among classics.  Later followed by some great and not so great sequels, audiences will find this movie to be the strongest in the series.  The new DVD is just gorgeous.  The picture has never looked better and the sound and color have never been more crisp.  Old movies like these often suffer from age on VHS, but thanks to a nice transfer by Paramount, this DVD is worth the money.  As always, there are no extras except for a trailer, but just watching the trailer is a treat for die hard fans.",Friday the 13th 1 VHS
89465,"Eraser is exactly the kind of movie that demonstrates the paucity of Hollywood's imagination--not in filmmaking, but in celebrating its own peculiar achievements. Eraser never set out to be a &quot;good&quot; film, and it succeeds spectacularly at not achieving this goal. And why shouldn't Hollywood celebrate this kind of filmmaking? After Russell Crowe took best actor for Gladiator it seems apparent that the Oscars need entirely new categories: instead of best actor, how about best OVER-actor? Or &quot;Worst Dialogue Delivered Thoroughly Convincingly?&quot; It takes talent to go so far over the top that you come back again! I'd nominate James Colburn for &quot;Best Lee Marvin Impersonation&quot; and certainly James Caan would sweep the &quot;Most Intensely Smoked Cigarette&quot; category--can that guy suck smoke like nobody else! And Eraser might take &quot;Thinnest Thread of a Plot on Which Action Sequences Can Be Hung&quot;, although competition would be fierce. It would also be nominated for &quot;Coolest Sci-Fi Gun and Nozzle Flashes/Tracer Fire&quot; but wouldn't even get a mention for &quot;Most Buckets of Bullets&quot; or &quot;Most Buckets of Blood&quot;. Schwarzenegger himself could receive a lifetime achievement award for &quot;Most Throwaway Lines Obscured By An Accent&quot; which would complement his earlier &quot;Most Herculean Physique&quot; award nicely.

25177,"For some reasons I had reservations about seeing this film when I first heard about it; maybe because what I heard and the advertising I saw didn't begin to hint at its depth. Ostensibly its the story of two WASPs who get stranded in the Australian outback and meet an aborigine boy who helps them to surive their journey back to civilization. Most noticeably, for me, the movie criticizes the spiritual emptiness of civilized society and lets the viewer glimpse at some of uncharted territory's secret beauty. The movie works fine on this level. But its brilliance lies in how many different levels it does work, and its subtlety.It is a tragic story of two people who fail to communicate. The blindess of the girl (presented in quite a harsh light, and a symbolic big slap in the face to whitey now that I rethink it) despite huge language and cultural differences is inept or unwilling to understand the aborigine boy's perspective. Indeed she is deeply rooted in Anglo-Saxon values -- only the young boy, her companion, is able to break down the barrier and communicate simple ideas.There are points in the film that expose sexual tension as brilliantly and as subtley as I have ever seen. It is vastly important that the boy is not dramatized or stylized in any way, he seems really to have been picked out of the outback and cast directly in the movie. His behavior should seem at least somewhat bewildering to the audience, it was to me, particularly in the haunting mating dance scene. The girl rejects him out of a lack of understanding and fear, and he sheds tears of failure. Was sexual consumation a part of his walkabout or did he fall deeply for this girl. What are the cues to suggest the latter? I'd have to watch the movie again.Walkabout is delicate and complex but doesn't spoil itself by becoming overambitious. There are many, many internal psychological and emotional aspects of the two children that remain rightfully unexplored. Suffice to say being shot at by your dad and stranded in the wilderness might create some wrenching immediate -- nevermind longterm -- consequences. The film could easily have veered off into myriad branches and lost track of itself. Roeg decides to focus on particular elements and does so meticulously and with grace.And for the film's obvious disdain for civilized society, it doesn't necessarily suggest that the boy has an easier or more satisfying life. It merely presents a different angle -- though that angle is shot in breathtaking, but unsentimental, beauty. There is no sap in this film; the score is moving but does not grab forcefully at one's heartstrings. The shots of the outback are gorgeous, but they do not imply any false notions of peace in nature. And for these very reasons, the film, I would imagine, would be great at exposing both beauty and the harsh face of reality to kids despite all the complexity that wouldn't be understood.",N/A
260742,"CONQUEST is perhaps the most important in the series since it tells the opposite story of the first APES movie.  Now, apes are abused and dumb and humans are in control.  The movie is extremely violent and dark in its dipiction of man's treatment of ape.  If you do not like abuse on animals then I suggest you avoid CONQUEST since the apes are treated horribly....so horribly it gets to be disturbing.  The movie itself is interesting and ingaing to watch, but unlike the previous movies, the most part of this movie is serious with very little comedy reliefe or moments of joy.  The dark tone is eventually lifted when the apes rebel against the humans and re-claim the planet in what is one of the most powerful and important climaxes of the series.  Roddy McDowall's final speech at the end of the movie is perhaps one of the best speeches in movie history.

Those who know and admire the book will be pleasantly surprised with this mostly-forgotton (and unjustifiably so) Technicolor gem from 1938. In its day, this version had all that money could buy (most notably Technicolor!) The previously unknown child actors amazingly look just like Tom and Becky should look; it just misses greatness (Tommy Kelly was no Freddie Bartholomew) but its still a film filled with endearing, nostalgic scenes, faithfully reproduced.......... After whitewashing Aunt Polly's fence, Tom and Huck visit the cemetery on a strange, nocturnal errand. Huck has a dead cat in a bag and a theory that by heaving it after the devils who carry off the corpse of a newly buried sinner, a boy can get rid of worts. In the cemetery, Tom and Huck witness a murder by Indian Joe; they sign in blood an agreement never to tell. Tom and Becky go exploring and get lost in a limestone cave, then there's the sequence where the pirates return to their own funeral..........Incredibly, more than 25,000 kids were interviewed in the search for suitable child actors to fit the roles of Tom and Becky.

They hear a curse that surrounds the movie that basicly when ever someone has tried to finish it before, they end up dead. Not listining they track down the movies original star who was also attacked by the killer on set but turned the tables on him and killed him. She doesn't want to go back to set but does anyway. As soon as the students start filming they start to dissapear in gory fasion, it seems the killer is back.  Cut is a truly great movie that deserves to be up there with Scream instead of going straight to video everywhere. It's probably one of the only Australian slasher films out there and like most Aussie horror there is buckets of blood. The charicter development could of been alot better, most of them I couldn't even remeber there names. The killer is cool, I loved when you found out who he was in the ending a bit of a surprise. His weapon was wierd it was a modified pair of ardin shears, I loved the line &quot;it's not a knife officer, just a pair of gardin shears, slightly modified so I can do interesting things with it, like chop heads off&quot;. Another cool thing was that this starred 80s teen queen Molly Ringwald as one of the leads.

662978,"This is not a very good movie. In fact, it seems as if the film makers have taken the most dull, predictable, and conservative route that this subject matter has ever seen. If you are a fan of the classics Texas Chainsaw Massacre or Psycho, don't even bother wasting your time on Ed Gein. With a few quick edits, this could play on network television. There is absolutely NO shock value or gore. The director spends an inordinate amount of time illustrating Gein's relationship with different town members. This is so boring and no one cares! The fact that the man had SEVERED HEADS hanging from his door and dressed in a body suit of DEAD SKIN are just briefly passed over; and I mean briefly. The reason why people wanted to see a movie about Gein is to know the intimate and sick details of what he actually did to his victims. As a film, Ed Gein is so conservative that the most disturbing part is watching his mother and father gut one of the pigs on the farm. Railsback is decent as Gein but attention to detail is overlooked, like having his mom be rail \-thin when in reality she was heavy. The scene were he kills his older brother is pretty ridiculous too, complete with computer generated fire. All in all, I am still waiting for someone to have the guts to show what actually happened inside of that farmhouse. Until that day, I will continue to watch Texas Chainsaw Massacre and believe all the hype about Ed Gein.",N/A

506924,"Welle's never had final cut after Kane.  Everything from Ambersons on was in some way shape or form re-edited or &quot;fixed&quot; by it's producers.  Occaissionally it was minor interferrence (like &quot;The Stranger&quot; or &quot;Touch Of Evil&quot;).  Frequently is was outright (possibly malicious) butchery like &quot;...Ambersons&quot;, or &quot;...Shanghai&quot;.But &quot;Othello&quot; seems to fall into the category of stupidity and incompetence.  It's theoretically possible there was something wrong with the DVD I received, but I doubt it.  Apparently, running out of money, Welles hired a low-end post-prod house, who used their worst staff to complete this film.Thirty five years later it was restored (not completely, unfortunately), had is musical score reconstructed and re-recorded, and it's tracks re-mixed.  Unfortunately there wasn't much they could do abut the dialog, which remains muffled and often out of sync.But to the FILM:The score is STUNNING.  The Images are STUNNING.  What's left of the performances is good to excellent.  Othello is Welles flexing his design muscles beyond the pyrotechnics of Kane and Touch of Evil.&quot;Othello&quot; is essentially a series of perfectly composed static shots -- very much like an Eisenstien film (Alexander Nyevsky or Ivan The Terrible come immediatly to mind).  Shot in a real Castle, and brilliantly photographed by at least three DOPs, I think it may be the best designed of all Welle's films.  Here Welles doesn't use the long take, or mise-en-scene to get himself out of trouble: it's all editing, dramatic compositions and lighting.And once again he shows himself to be the master.The music is still extrodinary. The transcribing and re-recording are wonderful, and the soundtrack should be released as a seperate item.  Think &quot;The Haunting&quot; (Robert Wise), with touches of Bernard Herrman and you'll get the idea.  Even in this department Wells was breaking new ground.But for all this great stuff, ultimately (for me, at least) it's a magnificent failure.

And now with the release of this gem onto DVD, you get even more to write home to Momma about.2 Audio Commentaries - The first with Director Robert Zemeckis, Producer Steve Starkey and Production Designer Rick Carter is a nice mix of storytelling, special effects talk, and personal memories, while the second commentary by Producer Wendy Finerman is a more intimate setting (since she's alone), giving cute stories such as the reason why the speakers are cut off while Forrest is speaking in Washington D.C. is because no one could think of anything profound enough for him to say for real.Through The Eyes of Forrest Gump - This 30 minute documentary is one of the most famous, in that it was sold separately on video in stores all over the country...and sold well.  On the laserdisc of Forrest Gump it was included as a bonus on side 4.  So many wonderful moments from the film are discussed, including how they were able to have Tom Hanks shake hands and interact with JFK, turning Tom into a ping pong wizard, as well as making Gary Sinise (Lt. Dan) believably look as if he truly lost his legs.  This is certainly not your run of the mill &quot;making of&quot; that gets boring after a few minutes.  It instead holds your interest to the point where you're saying &quot;WOW!!  So that's how they did it!&quot;  My only complaint is that the transfer of this documentary didn't seem crisp and sharp enough.  It almost seemed like they just copied it off of a laserdisc.  I happen to own the laserdisc, so I compared the two and to me, the laser looked brighter and sharper.  But it's a minor complaint.  The film itself looks great!The Magic of Makeup - A wonderful look at how the makeup in this film was so crucial to its success.  Included is makeup for Tom Hanks, Robin Wright Penn, Gary Sinise and Sally Field.  Tom's beard growing is interesting, but watching Sally Field being transformed into an elderly woman is astonishing!Through The Ears of Forrest Gump - This is the sort of thing most moviegoers take for granted...the sound of a film.  When you watch this segment you'll get a sense of just how important sound was in making scenes come alive: the sound of the bikes rolling after a young Forrest as he breaks free of his metal braces, the tracers and mortar explosions during the Vietnam sequence, creating different ways to convey the sound of the rain in Vietnam as Forrest had said rained in so many different ways, the storm at sea, and much more!Building The World of Gump - Creating the places and settings of the film, including Forrest's home in Alabama, Vietnam, and Washington D.C.  All crucial to the films believability.Seeing Is Believing - 11 visual effects from the film are discussed, including 2 that didn't make the final cut.  Forrest was planned to meet Martin Luther King, Jr., a scene involving dogs being released to stop what Forrest thought was a &quot;parade&quot; of black Americans, headed by King.  But because Forrest knew all the dogs since they were puppies, he unknowingly stops the violence by getting their attention with a stick, then apologizes to Mr. King, himself (&quot;They're just dogs&quot;) - The other new scene is a ping pong match with George Bush Sr when he was the Ambassador to China and having Forrest hit him in the crotch with the ball.  Both of these scenes are winners to me, but I'm sure they may have bogged down the story some, and that's why they were cut.  Nice to have them here though.Photo Gallery - Some nice still shots of the film that are definitely worth looking at.Screen Tests - A total of 7, the first 3 with Michael Conner Humphrey (Young Forrest) and Hanna R. Hall (Young Jenny), 2 with Robin Wright Penn (Jenny), and 2 with Haley Joel Osment (Forrest Gump Jr.).  Besides witnessing these characters coming to life for the first time through the actors, it's also interesting to see Tom Hanks before he employed Micheal Humphrey's accent to his own and how this made a huge difference.2 Theatrical Trailers - including the &quot;Remember...&quot; trailer, which contains no dialogue and just uses Alan Silvestri's wonderful score.Get the film that gave Tom Hanks his second consecutive Oscar on DVD in a nice two disc set.  Relive the magic and the memories.  Relive Forrest Gump.&quot;And that's all I have to say about that&quot;. - Tom Hanks as Forrest Gump",N/A
543039,"Like two other 2001 releases, Sexy Beast and Snatch, The Score is a tautly made heist movie. I liked it a little more than Sexy Beast and a lot more than Snatch, because director Frank Oz, unlike Jonathan Glazer and Guy Ritchie, isn't always throwing his technique in our faces. The Score doesn't pretend to be anything but an old-fashioned crime thriller, and it succeeds extremely well at it, not least because it is so beautifully cast. To see Marlon Brando, Robert De Niro and Edward Norton on screen together is the thespian equivalent of a six-course dinner at the Ritz. And if Brando looks as if he's consumed a few too many such dinners--his character here is a cross between Sydney Greenstreet and Truman Capote--it is still wonderful to see him again, and to see that he's still very much at the top of his acting game. As superb as the three male stars are, special mention must also be made of Angela Bassett, who brings charm and radiance to her small role as De Niro's girlfriend. The twists and turns in The Score's plot, with all the requisite double- and triple-crosses, are nothing new to any aficionado of heist movies.

The players and management study their sports on and off the gridiron. When the movie shows the game going on, it feels like you're playing. It is right there with the play and every sound made and movement is right with you and it shows everyone what it is really like. Contrary to other football movies like &quot;The Replacements&quot;, it doesn't say that the good guys always win. BELIEVABLE STORY.  Pacino does another very convincing and emotional role and Jamie Foxx does fairly decent in one of his non-comedy roles.  If you look at this in the eyes that &quot;it's just a football movie&quot; then it will seem far too long. But, if you understand it's depth and truancy of the sports world, you'll enjoy this.

I love this movie as much as I did 17 years ago.While the the special effects may seem primitive, they have a unique and entertaining quality about them, I especially like the clouds.

660960,"There is nothing wrong with sweet movies.  I love sweet movies.  I love sweet, charming, affectionate movies that observe human nature through humorous and insightful lenses.  I saw just such a movie last year.  It was called ""Almost Famous.""If you haven't seen that particular title yet, you may have to after watching ""Chocolat;"" I can't think of a more appropriate way to wash out that synthetic aftertaste.  Movies like ""Chocolat"" aren't written or directed--they're engineered.Perhaps the finest chocolate requires an exact recipe, but provocative and entertaining cinema doesn't.  Just the opposite, really--great filmmaking resists formula.  But this inconsequential fluff piece, which imagines an insular French community where the transforming power of chocolate is enough to provoke life-changing epiphanies, is so blandly predictable, so precisely calculated to make you feel warm and fuzzy, that you almost wish--no, beg--for something unexpected and off-the-wall to happen.What makes ""Chocolat"" so easily digestible--and what led the Academy to idiotically award the film five undeserved Oscar nominations, aside from Miramax's relentlessly tacky advertising campaign--is the undeniable skill and craftsmanship in front of and behind the camera.  When you've got a director as respected as Lass Hallstrom and A-list talent like Juliette Binoche and Judi Dench, you can be sure it's all going to go down smoothly.  Gorgeous cinematography and sumptuous shots of melting chocolate certainly don't hurt.But when these ingredients are at the disposal of a script that relies so frustratingly on age-old conventions, a script that obliviously trots out the most pedestrian characters--and from the self-righteous mayor and the battered wife to the innocent boy with the domineering mother, they're all here--you have to wonder what the point of assembling all this talent is.  Binoche does absolutely nothing in this film to warrant her best actress nomination--nothing, perhaps, except to remind you that a long time ago she actually took on challenging roles.  Ditto Dench, who is such a towering performer that she shouldn't even be looking down her nose at a film like this.The fact that ""Chocolat"" paid off so handsomely for Miramax is disheartening indeed--not only because it cheated far superior movies of their just desserts, but because of the unavoidable suggestion that this film actually says something important.  It doesn't.  What it does, in fact, is indulge a message of staggering phoniness and simplicity.  ""Tolerance"" is the operative word in ""Chocolat's"" artificial little fairy-tale universe--embrace everyone and everything, toss out the narrow-minded regulations and principles that once held you captive, and oh, have a Belgian creme while you're at it because chocolate is the key to unlocking the deepest mysteries of human nature.  It's movies like this that give art-house pretension a bad name.",N/A

468736,"Despite David Cronenberg's position as my second-favourite director, even an out-and-out fan like me notices when he starts to repeat himself. One of the problems with auteur directors who write, produce, and direct their movies is that you tend to see a repetition of themes. Now these might be put down to style, but there are lots of ideas here from Videodrome and The Fly, albeit with more up to the minute special effects. The obsession with the body, self-inflicted bodily change and decay is here, with a good measure of William Gibson thrown in. Unless I missed something, the idea of plugging yourself into an organic computer and experiencing virtual reality first came up in the Matrix in 1976's Doctor Who in the story The Deadly Assassin, and the idea of not knowing which reality you are in has been rather worn out by Philip K. Dick. It's not a bad film by any means, and Jude Law turns in a particularly impressive performance. It is however predictable and derivative, and a director with a track record for originality as good as Cronenberg's is capable of so much more.",Existenz VHS
397414,"Released in 1967 to controversy and criticism, now considered a classic film (the American Film Institute rated it #27 on their list of America's 100 Greatest Movies) responsible for a significant shift in cinematic direction in the late '60s, &quot;Bonnie and Clyde&quot; is one of those rare films in which every facet combines to create something truly extraordinary. Anchored by strong performances from Beatty and Dunaway as the titular characters, with Gene Hackman, Estelle Parsons, and Michael J.

140284,"This is by far my favorite kind of movie. I am a political junkie (Republican/Libertarian if you must ask), love international intrigue and Sinatra. I first saw this at a film festival when I was 13 and would not see it again until one night in college after a few too many gin & tonics. I then remembered the imagery that came back and wanted to play solitaire&#8230; okay not solitaire. But what this movie does do is it makes you realize the period. Done in era where anti-Communist sentiment ran strong and fears of war was as normal as the Today show is to us, this movie reminds me of a time when I did not live. Okay enough with the sappy metaphor and unclear logic.This movie is fantastic for so many reasons. First, Frank Sinatra, the standard bearer of my grandparents&#8217; generation, puts on an incredible performance. For those of us younger viewers, the concept may be difficult because the acting is so stylized and the filming technique makes it feel like a movie not a documentary. But, nonetheless this guy wasn&#8217;t an actor by trade but would make you think that this was as natural as his voice is. Second, the story is incredible and truly makes you wonder why no one writes like that any more. You are taken on such a journey and are never quite sure until the end how the tale of politics, assasiniation and [...] is going to spin together. Finally, the movie has such strong acting by other characters as to realize that perhaps needing a big name on the marquis will get people in the door, but only solid acting by everyone else gets the ticket buyer (or the DVD buyer) home happy. The cast carries their roles impeccablely and truly makes this a great piece of cinema.",N/A

535908,"Let's not fool ourselves into thinking that this is a good movie. The follow-up to the critically successful ""Silence of the Lambs,"" is a meager attempt at best. I guess the problem stems from the fact that the novel was not that good. ""Shock value"" and ""tasteless"" are a few words that come to mind. In a movie with such great talent and a pretty good director, you would hope that the movie would succeed where the novel failed, but that was not the case.What intrigued me about the first film was the everlooming presence of Anthony Hopkins. Behind the glass cage, you sensed the danger in his character. In this film, he's all over the place. Now, he's just an old guy that's walking across the street. They tried humanizing him, trying to give him more emotions to work with, which was a mistake, since at face value, Anthony Hopkins looks like one of your dad's older friends - harmless - instead of the psychopathic killer we'd expect from him. His presence is gone. Now we know why he's a psychopathic killer; ...Honestly, the only thing that kept me awake in the film are the over the top gross out scenes we'd expect from a bad ""Nightmare on Elm St."" film. If this film didn't receive the NC-17 rating for violence, I don't know what will.Still, Anthony Hopkins gives a great performance. That's about it.",N/A
423733,"Mean Streets is the movie that broke out the careers of director Martin Scorcese and Harvey Keitel and Robert DeNiro.  The film set the mold for the directorial style that Mr. Scorcese would follow the rest of his career; including the goodfella plotline and heavy doses of doo wop music, early 60's rock &amp; r&amp;b.  The story centers around Charlie, who is a low level mobster.  He doesn't have alot of rank and privilege, but the guys in the neighborhood always seem to come to them with their problems.  Charlie is quite religious and despite his shady career, he is a nice guy.  He keeps his relationship with his epileptic girlfriend Theresa a secret and he is constantly putting out fires started by her cousin and his best friend Johnny-Boy.  Johnny is a loose cannon who in debt big time to a local loan shark.  The movie ends in a rush of gunfire and crashing cars.  Mr. Scorcese does a magnificent job of conveying the day-to-day life of guys in Little Italy.  The film has a definite personal touch and you can image that these were the guys he knew from his neighborhood. Mr. Keitel is Charlie and he does a great job of portraying him as a man with all the weight of the world on his shoulders.  Even though Mr. Keitel has the lead role and is in just about every scene, the real star of the film is Mr. DeNiro as Johnny-Boy.  He explodes off the screen with a fiery, over the top performance.

It is unfortunate that the 2 leads had barely any scenes together except until the final scene. That is what made the first, is the intense interaction between the 2.

Alex Cross was much better in &quot;Kiss The Girls&quot;, but here he is just a flat photocopy of his character from that and from the incredible film &quot;Se7en&quot;. This is a character that Freeman can do well, given a script better than this one.The whole &quot;plot&quot; of the film consists of a kidnapping from a rich school.

Freeman sees that she has some talent, so he allows her to tag along and try to help him catch the kidnapper. The plot is long and drawn out, with moments where we are all supposed to feel compassion as the characters spill their guts about their past, something that is in every thriller.This movie is just a rehash of other movies. Better movies. This is a film that is not well done, just downright irritating.

284367,"This 1937 gangster flick is sensational. It tells the story of Mary Dwight and her four roomates who worked as hostesses in a nightclub. When that club is taken over by a gangster named Vanning, the club is transformed into a clip joint for unsuspecting customers. The job of the hostess is to make sure that the customers are having a good time, so that they spend their money drinking and gambling.When Mary's naive sister, Betty, whom Mary is putting through college, pays her an unexpected visit, Mary is thrown for a loop, as Betty believes that Mary has a legitimate job. Mary struggles to keep of the masquerade for naught, as Mary is arrested by the police on a trumped up murder charge. It seems that one of the nightclub customers, who had welched on a gambling debt to the club, turned up dead with Mary's telephone number in his pocket. With the matter becoming front page news, the veil is pulled from her younger sister's eyes.When kid sister Betty refuses to return to school, due to the  notoriety surrounding the arrest, which was ultimately dropped, Mary keeps her under virtual house arrest. Bored one night, she accompanies one of Mary's roommates to one of Vanning's parties, unbeknownst to Mary. It is a party from which she will never return home. When Mary discovers where her now missing sister had been, she suspects the worst and enlists the help of an idealistic prosecutor to help her.When she ultimately finds out what happened to her sister, she vows to get Vanning and tells him so to his face. Vanning, naturally, does not take her threat lightly and has his goons place his special mark on her to teach her a lesson and keep her silent. Mary, however, does not let this stop her in her quest to obtain justice for her sister. Enlisting the help of her initially reluctant fellow hostesses and that of the zealous prosecutor, she ultimately has her day in court.Vanning will rue the day he crossed swords with Mary.This is a terrific film, with wonderful, award calibre performances to be had by all. Davis, as Mary Dwight, is street smart and hard boiled. She is also lovely to look at. Her roommates and fellow hostesses, played by Lola Lane, Isabel Jewell, Rosalind Marquis, and Mayo Methot, all have great chemistry with each other and Mary. All have great dialogue with which to work, fast paced, sharp, and often witty. Moreover, they each have a beautiful wardrobe of clothing.Jane Bryan also gives a more than credible performance as Mary's fresh faced, younger sister. Eduardo Ciannelli with his authentic Italian accent is aptly sinister as the ganster, Vanning, and a young Humphrey Bogart is terrific as the prosecutor, giving a clipped, no nonsense delivery of his lines.This is, without a doubt, one of Bette Davis' best films.

It starts off with La Motta as an overweight comedian just before going on stage, in 1964, and finishes with him going on stage. The story unfolds from there on, starting in 1941.The troubled life of La Motta, from his relationships to his business deals, is shown in an unflinching manner. Martin Scorsese doesn't hold back. Every bit of violence is shown in the boxing ring and every bit outside it. Raging Bull is shot in classic black and white, reflecting the setting of the action. The close-ups, lighting, reminds me of great classical films but the depiction is all Scorsese. If it's Italian, got plenty of swearing, smart guys, pretty girls and violence it's bound to be Scorsese. Mind you, that's not a bad thing at all.La Motta's impatience, paranoia and way of dealing with things, is clearly shown, ruining his relationship with his second wife and, eventually, his brother,, played by Joe Pesci. De Niro plays the role to perfection as you feel the impact of La Motta's emotions.Raging Bull is one of my favourite films by Martin Scorsese because it's more realistic.

262989,"The Elizabeth Taylor version of CLEOPATRA has taken quite a beating over the years, and its easy to see why: the film is elephantine, with an emphasis on making everything BIG; as such, it eventually sinks under its own weight.It is difficult to imagine any other actress better suited to play Cleopatra, but Taylor does comparatively little with the role, coming off as less the complex Queen of the Nile than a luxury-loving little minx out for a slinky good time.  Rex Harrison and Richard Burton fare a bit better, although not much. Still, the emphasis is on spectacle--and in spite of the big budgets, historic costuming, and mammoth sets it is really here that the film falls apart.The problem, really, is that the film's spectacle is too imaginative and takes too many liberties.  A good example is found in the role of Cleopatra herself: the historical Cleopatra considered herself Greek and probably wore Egyptian attire only for ceremonial occasions, but the film prefers to present her flatly in stereotypical fashion, when the truth would have been considerably more complex and entertaining.  Much the same may be said for most of the characters in the film.  As the film progresses, it becomes increasingly difficult to accept these characters as anything else but movie stars playing parts.And in terms of spectacle, in spite of all the money poured into it, the movie looks cheap.  Sure, they had a budget of heaven only knows how much money, but they had to stretch it to costume so many people that the wardrobe department had to settle for nylon-looking material, and a great many of the sets betray the fact that they are sound-stage created.  Then, when really lavish spectacle occurs--as in Cleopatra's entrance into Rome--the production values clash: they seem to be two completely different movies.It is difficult for me to understand why any one would want to spend money on a VHS, much less a DVD (even with various bells and whistles added), of this particular film.  If you must see the film, you're better off renting it or catching a rerun on cable television.  For CLEOPATRA is essentially a curiosity: a film that should have worked... but didn't.",N/A

I was kept on the edge of my seat throughout though-trying to figure out how this tangled weave would become unspun. Happily, I was quite pleased with the outcome. It appears that morals stood up -or at least to a degree.  It is hard to truly understand what James had its characters really thinking and feeling throughout the movie.

But in the end, the lack of kung-fu and an engaging story leads to a big superfluous mound of color and chaos, which will only please the most diehard Hark or Hong Kong fan.  BTW: Check out Hark's finest, &quot;Peking Opera Blues,&quot; &quot;The Blade,&quot; and &quot;Time and Tide,&quot; for the best cinema has to offer from the last fifteen years.",Zu: Warriors of the Magic Mountain
566291,"I did enjoy this movie, but I still had a few problems with it.In general, it's a film worth seeing, with plenty of comedic and dramatic moments to keep your attention.  I grew up with a sister in beauty pageants, so I can tell you that the satire is not too far off base.My biggest problem was that I just didn't understand the motivation for Joey Lauren Adams's character to continue to put up with all of the things that Minnie Driver's character dished at her.  Who would put up with that stuff?  The complexity of Minnie Driver giving up her child to Joey Lauren Adams while still living with her is not true-to-life.  Imagine the emotional issues this would cause with all three of them - yet, they seem to see this sort of thing as &quot;normal.&quot;I was not disappointed in the acting and did shed a tear at the end of the movie.  I would recommend seeing it, just maybe not buying it.",N/A
464606,"Another small, scene stealer film from England, Little Voice is loaded with three  tour de force performance s by Jane Horrocks, Michael Caine, and  Blenda Blethyn.  Horrocks is &quot;Little Voice,&quot; the shyest of the shy daughter of a dead record store owner who is overshadowed by the obnoxious mother of mother's (Blethyn).  Caine is a small time promoter who hears LV singing to her old 33 LP collection and realizes she is a golden opportunity for him to make it to the big time.  LV sings to avoid the reality of her mother and her mother's lovers, but mostly, she sings to remember her father, the only kindness in her wretched life.  Ewan McGregor in a small bit part befriends LV, but it is Horrocks stunning singing voice that captures the film and attention.  Reprising her stage role, Horrock's dead on immitations of Garland, Shirley Bassey, and Marilyn Monroe are superb.This film is a gem and should be a part of every film library both for it's story and the music.",Little Voice

449165,"Carry On Up The Kyber is undoubtedly one of the very best of the series, if not THE best. Whilst most Carry on films suffered an onslaught of criticism from critics, they actually joined in praise for this entry, and rightly so.The Khaszi of Kalabar finds information that proves that the men of The Third Foot And Mouth regiment are not &quot;the devil in skirts&quot; as they claim to be, so he decides to bring their presence in India to an end. With Sir Sidney Ruff Diamond's (head of &quot;the devil in skirts&quot;) cushy job threatened to come to an end, he decides to take action against it.The irreplacable Hattie Jaques and Barbara Windsor are missing from this entry but most of the other regulars are here such as Sid James, Joan Sims, Kenneth Williams, Charles Hawtrey, Terry Scott and Bernard Bresslaw as well as featuring the talents of Roy Castle, in his only Carry On role and Angela Douglas who previously had appeared in Carry On Cowboy (1965), Screaming (1966) and Follow That Camel (1967). The best players in this historical romp are Sid James and Joan Sims as the hilarious Ruff Diamonds. Joan Sims delivery is priceless as her delicatley, well spoken voice occasionally slides into a broad cockney accent - amusing stuff!Carry On Up The Kyber is consistently funny throughout with Talbot Rothwell's script bubbling with inventive repartee and sparkling razor sharp wit. The film boasts the best ending in a Carry On film, where the gang are all keeping a stiff British upper lip and deciding to ignore the attack that's taking place outside the building, proceed to continue with their supper whilst the building is collapsing around their ears.Classic British comedy at its very best and fans of the series will be delighted.",Carry on Up the Khyber VHS

5130,"I happen to be a great admirer of the controversial Mr Greenaway. I think his direction in film is bold and produces powerful results. The Pillow Book is a great example of this talent. It is an amazing combination of his narrative technique, experimental explorations and talent for finding compelling stories. The images are beautiful, especially the shot of Vivian Wu standing in the rain covered with writing on her flesh which slowly melts away. Her character is not that complex, but the action of the story is sufficient to carry her along throughout the tale as she fights for independence and a suitable form of artistic expression. Essentially the story is about the fetishisation of books and sex. These things are enough to make a great movie in my mind.  Nagiko is a girl who goes through a ritual where her father writes on her back on her birthday as he tells her of a myth. After burning her way out of a suffocating marriage, she grows up to become a radical artist writing on bodies and searching for a man who can replace her father in the birthday tradition. She meets a talented man named Jerome who she falls in love with, but is eventually sacrificed to her father's old enemy. In the course of the narrative she writes her own Pillow Book on a series of men. It culminates in a gruesome act of jealousy and revenge (a notion not foreign to Greenaway's narratives).The scene of Jerome's suicide is particularly powerful and works well with the screen-in-screen shots because it shows in one shot the sequence between thought and action, self-perception and actual action. This is a new style for Greenaway that works tremendously well in this movie because it fits so well with the egotism and self-obsession of the characters involved. The movie as a whole is a powerful evocation of a great Japanese classic. I highly recommend this movie who is in the mood to watch something eccentric, visually moving and stunningly beautiful.",N/A
565379,"I have read Frank Herbert's Dune series and waiting impatiently for it to be filmed. I got to see the David Lynch version--which Frank Herbert supposed helped create--and was stunned by its stiffness and gernerally proding story.  Years later, when the director's cut was released, the movie played a lot better...but not better than this version.This version is extraordinary. I have watched it 3 times and each time I reveal in the beauty and excellent story telling. This is the book come to life in front of you! The people contributing to the film are first rate. I enjoyed the character transistion of Paul--and this most of all made this movie click for me. Paul matured in this film version. He goes from spoiled only kid to forceful leader and hero.This version of Dune also brings to life the book's original narrator and observer.  Princess Irulan is wonderfully cast and this character's contribution to the overall story is fantastic.I wish the makers of this version consider taking up some of the additional stories of Frank Herberts Dune--ChapterHouse was by far the most thrilling and imaginative!I applaud SciFi channel for its original programming and willingness to take a SciFi's grand master's epic and turn it into quality visual entertainment!",Frank Herbert's Dune TV Miniseries  VHS
98831,"If you're expecting a happy camping trip in Deliverance, you're in for a surprise.I wasn't prepared for the sheer suspense of one particular scene.  It is so harrowing, it makes my stomach turn every time I see it.  I'm begging Boorman to cut away.  &quot;Go back to Burt Reynolds&quot; I'm yelling to the screen.  &quot;Let's see what he's up to.  It can't be any worse than this.&quot;  This is filmmaking at its most powerful.The story is a simple one.  Four friends head into the back woods of America - a place civilisation seems to have forgotten.  They leave their cars to a bunch of in-bred and very frightening looking hillbillies and head off down the river in canoes.  These back-woods are soon going to be the victims of an irrigation programme and the river and its surrounding population doesn't have much longer to live.The foursome's first forays down the river are fun, enjoying the challenge posed by the rapids.  They're exploring their animal instincts but failing.  Jon Voight, in one particular scene, attempts to shoot a deer and misses by a lot.  He's been away from the woods too long.Then, out of left field comes one of the most brutal scenes in movie history.  The four, instead of being under threat from the rapids are now under threat from mankind, including themselves.  It is up to Voight to cover up their crime, when the film's hero, Reynolds is shot down.  He succeeds or does he?The film's open-ended.  It leaves a lot of questions unanswered.

528214,"The Cell provoked a very mixed bag of feelings inside of me. first off, the visual style of the film is absolutly fantastic; rich and colorful and vibrant and complex and fluid. On the other hand, its violence is truely sadistic (the iron scene made me cringe and avert my eyes, but even that didn't help, the sound still reached me) and one wonders how much relevence it has to the plot other than to disturb. and thats another thing, the plot. the plot was probably thirty pages of actual story and seventy pages of visual descriptions. Sheesh, you know NOTHING about anyone (even Starger, the killer. His pysche is twisted to the point where you can't really tell for sure why he is the way he is) and in the end, care for no one. I'm not saying that The Cell is bereft of interesting ideas; there are a great many things that make this movie interesting, especially the small child at the end in a truely heart-wrenching scene that seems out of place, and the visual effects, sets, and costumes alone keep you watching, even if at times you don't want to. I'm saying that this is one movie where the current director should have been kept on for the visuals, and someone else hired to do everything else, because Tarsem Singh HAS NO IDEA HOW TO DO ANYTHING OTHER THAN VISUALS! the fact that there are a few interesting character scenes are a fluke. watch this movie once for the visual effects, and then forget about it and see movies with some real meaning.",N/A

219168,"When I first saw this film, as a preteen, I thought it was the ultimate romance. Well, I got older ... and saw it again. And it's still pretty romantic. In fact, it's still a film I watch over and over.The performances are really juicy. Everyone in it seems to understand the over-the-top quality of Tennessee Williams, and no one disappoints. You'll find Charles Bronson and a very young Robert Blake in supporting roles here. Both Kate Reid, as Wood's driving, ambitious `Mama' using her beautiful daughter to hook the town's men, and Mary Badham, as `Willie', the not-so-beautiful younger sister who idolizes Wood, are quite simply superb. Every move, every look from both are truly sublime.Natalie Wood has always been one of my favorite stars, and she is every inch the star in this one. It's clear from her first closeup how special, how different, and how exciting Alva Starr is to everyone she comes in contact with. She meets her match in Robert Redford, the man who has no dreams, who sees her in  unvarnished black and white but comes to appreciate her need to color life ... in fact, realizes he can't live without it when he's separated from her.Is it great drama? No. But it's glorious soap opera. The best soap opera, the most memorable Southern soap opera, you're likely to find. These people have real problems, real needs, and they're beautifully drawn by the screenwriters (thank you, Francis Coppola, among others) and by the actors who play them. We're given a lot of time to know them and care about them, and we do care, very much.It's one of my favorite guilty pleasures, and I expect I'll keep watching it for years to come.

Instead, you get musical numbers up the wazoo and stale comedy routines.This is not their worst picture -- &quot;Love Happy&quot; has that infamous distinction.  But, &quot;The Big Store&quot; is right up there in the flop standings.I have to agree with another reviewer, the Marx Brothers were getting old by this time and their energy level just wasn't there anymore.

47617,"&quot;The Shadow&quot; is something like Batman, Superman, the Phantom, and other comic superheroes, but on the other hand, it is very unlike them in that... I totally loved it!Alec Baldwin is Lamont Cranston, known as Yiinko in Tibet as a drug lord. He is one of the most evil and barbaric men there, until one day he is brought up to a strange priest named Tulku (Brady Tsurutani). Tulku tells Cranston that he must redeem himself by fighting crime and that he will teach him how to 'cloud men's minds'. Having no choice, Cranston learns from the priest. Seven years later, Cranston returns to New York City (of course it has to be New York City!) and fights crime. He is known to others only as 'the Shadow' because though he has the power of invisibility, there is one thing that he cannot hide and that is his shadow. The Shadow finds out that Shiwan Khan (John Lone), the last descendant of Genghis Khan, comes to New York. Shiwan had also been under the instruction of Tulku, to be redeemed from his evil ways but instead turned on Tulku, killing him, then using his new powers to his own evil purpose. And that is to conquer the world. He at first tries to have Cranston join him but Cranston refuses. Shiwan Khan uses the help of his warriors, a mad scientist Farley Claymore (Tim Curry), and absent-minded Dr. Reinhardt Lane (Ian McKellen) to create a bomb to destroy the city. But Shiwan is not the only one with help. Because with the unexpected help of the daughter of Dr. Lane, Margo Lane (Penelope Ann Miller) with her telepathic powers and Moe Shrevnitz (Peter Boyle), Cranston has a plan to stop Shiwan. But it will be difficult with Cranston's troubled heart and Shiwan's mind powers which may surpass even the power of 'the Shadow'.I'm very surprised that this movie didn't get very popular. There are many reasons why this movie is so wonderful. I've always loved good-looking Alec Baldwin, especially in his role as Jack Ryan in &quot;The Hunt for Red October&quot;. In this movie his acting and expressions are very good along with the acting done by beautiful Penelope Ann Miller, great John Lone, funny Jonathon Winters as Lamont's uncle, and everyone else. Except for maybe Tim Curry, I've never really liked him.Though some people may not like it for it being pretty corny, I thought that's what it made it so fun to watch! The action is cool, especially the end where Alec Baldwin hunts down John Lone with all the mirrors and glass in the room. The witty humor in it gave this movie also a right touch. I love the part where Margo Lane keeps interrupting Lamont Cranston because she can read his mind and knows what he's going to say. The music is just fantastic, giving the movie a creepy feeling to it. The cinematography and the gothic scenes also help.And I totally agree with everyone, the F/X were pretty terrific! From the really scary Fulba the knife, the shadows, Baldwin's blue eyes becoming black, the Shadow's invisibility, and the end where all of the mirrors shatter, these F/Xs will dazzle you. There's also the costumes which I was really impressed with with Margo's evening gowns and furs which were stunning and even Lamont's suits, the hat (especially the hat!), and his Shadow outfit. You know, at the end where Baldwin has the hat, the cape, and scarf off, his outfit really looks like Neo's in the movie, &quot;Matrix&quot; (Alec Baldwin looks so cool wearing this outfit with his chrome .45's in his hands!).Here are a few of my most favorite lines from the movies:(Lamont is staring at the lovely Margo while not paying attention to his Uncle Wainright) Uncle Wainwright: &quot;Why am I talking to the back of your neck?! Lamont?!&quot;(Uncle Wain talking about Margo) Uncle Wainright: &quot;What do you see in her?&quot;Lamont: &quot;Uncle Wainright, are you sure you're not dead?&quot;(After Margo keeps interrupting Lamont because she knows his thoughts) Lamont: Um, do you mind if I just get one tiny little sentence out here?&quot;(When Lamont starts to leave Margo) Margo: &quot;Hey, how will you know where I am?&quot;Lamont (mysteriously smiles): &quot;I'll know.&quot;Put it all together, you have a great movie which is entertaining and so much fun to watch!! A superb movie though very unrecognized, &quot;The Shadow&quot; will be one of my favorite movies to watch for a long, long time!",N/A
293467,"This film deserves to be in the pantheon of classic teen angst films (though it will really speak to adults reflecting on their years more so than it will for teens).  I think it's the best film I've ever seen in that genre (and is based on probably the best album that ever covered such ground).  There is real grit to the film, real emotion and pathos (but also a teriffic sense of humor).  The cast is also outstanding (why Phil Daniels didn't become a big star is anybody's guess).  But add to this the knockout soundtrack (from the ""Quadrophenia"" LP and other radio hits of the 60s), and you practically have a perfect film (I'm always hesitant to say anything is truly perfect).  But I wouldn't change anything here.  It is an unqualified success.It helps to understand the milieu of the film, so read up here on the mods and rockers so that you understand the time and place.

As far as I could see nothing stopped them from saying them (even God herself.  Jay's little tirade in front of her had me laughing so hard that fell out of my seat at the theatre).  I like characters who aren't all wishy-washy and who don't waffle around unless they have a character-changing experience.  Also, The issues raised range from the common (&quot;Is abortion right or wrong?&quot;) to the heirarchical (&quot;Is Catholicism stodgy and arcane?&quot;) to the silly (&quot;Do Bishops really bless their golf clubs for a better game?&quot;) to the divine (&quot;Is God a 'he' or a 'she'?&quot;).

I would point out some of the plot holes, but I'm still trying to figure out if there ever really was a plot in the first place. Sure the CGI graphics were interesting, but what's the point?There were what, a quarter million or so members of the 'Medjai' in that valley scene just waiting to go up against the Scorpion King's unholy army? Just take a few riders on a ridge over looking a valley, and paint in CGI replicas until you run out of room in the frame.Oh yeah, the DVD is also chock full of self-serving promo junk like stuff for the Scorpion King movie and some hokey-looking Universal Studios attraction. There's a commentary track, but I don't think I could stand to sit through it again.And the upcoming &quot;Scorpion King&quot; looks even better.....",The Mummy Returns VHS

It has got everything, action, ..., laughs and all with this self-depreciating smirk that is absolutely refresing in an evironment of too-cool-for-you hollywood [stuff].  Kurt Russel (who is an overlooked but extremely talented actor) gives a tour-de-force performance that holds the whole movie together.  Not many people would say this, but it is entirely his effort that makes this movie worthwhile.  His character, the inflated Jack Burton, is quite frankly a total loser.  This fact is entirely obvious to everybody but him and his persistance in percieving himself as totally cool despite all evidence to the contrary is what makes him so endearing.  Not only is he not cool, but he insists on proclaiming his coolness with this exagurated John Wayne swagger that ends up making a mockery of everything and everybody.  In the end, he does become sort of cool just by sheer force of will, it happens sort of by random and it is, amazingly, totally believable.  It seems perfectly natural when his coolness is achieved and acknowledged, and the inevitablity of this conclusion is summed up best by Jack Burton's own assessment, ""It's all in the reflexes!""",N/A

Another example of Hollywood's fetish with drugs, no doubt.  This has NOTHING in common with one of the most superior novels ever written (on which it CLAIMS to be based).

538804,"""Blow"" is a very good biopic on the life of cocaine kingpin George Jung (Johnny Depp) who rose to prominence in the 1980's as one of the largest cocaine traffickers in the United States.  The story is an interesting character study of Jung, who started selling marijuana to pay some bills and found that demand continued to outpace his ability to supply until he had built a cocaine empire.In an interview from prison included on the DVD, Jung states that the story was very true to actual events and that in certain cases it was like a flashback.  Jung appears from this interview to be a hapless soul who was willingly swept along by a riptide of forces that were beyond his sway, which is exactly how Depp portrayed him.Johnny Depp is an excellent character actor who relishes playing odd and offbeat characters.  In this film he gives one of his best and most nuanced performances with a clear understanding of the motivations and circumstances that spun Jung out of control.  He plays Jung with naivet&eacute; rather than giving him the sinister character that one might expect from a drug lord.  After having seen the interview with the real Jung it seems Depp was right on target.Penelope Cruz also expands her horizons, shedding her normally sweet persona to take on the part of Jung's shrewish, drug addicted wife.  Cruz plays the part with great force and emotion, like a woman possessed.  It is a fantastic portrayal of a bitter, self centered woman with a drug problem.Paul Reubens continues his comeback from the ill fated Pee-wee Herman days with a solid portrayal of Derek, the double dealing hair dresser who becomes Jung's primary distributor.  Rachel Griffiths and Ray Liotta also give fine performances as Jung's clueless parents.This character study is well written and sympathetically presented by director Ted Demme.  I rated it an 8/10.  It contains standout performances by both Depp and Cruz and is well worth seeing.",N/A
278289,"A picture-perfect modern-day romance that tells an exciting romantic story, &quot;Ghost&quot; is one of the best romantic films ever made. In it, we see just what lengths someone will go to for their love for someone else, and also shows us that the love we have for someone in our life goes on after death. Director Jerry Zucker, and acting by Patrick Swayze, Demi Moore and Whoopi Goldberg, all make this movie a landmark that everybody knows about.What is so special about the story is the connection between the two romantic leads. Swayze plays Sam Wheat, who, with his longtime girlfriend Molly, is remodeling a penthouse apartment in New York, where they soon live together, completely happy and in love. We have no reason to question the love story angle because the direction and acting tell us from the very beginning the nature of their relationship, and does it in understandable terms. Sam also works for a major banking corporation, where he has a best friend Carl, who seems more than willing to take certain workloads off of Sam's shoulders. One night, Sam and Molly are set upon by a thief, who demands Sam's wallet, and after a struggle, Sam is left with a fatal gunshot wound. Of course, being dead, he is now a ghost, and must watch as Molly comes to the realization that her lover is dead.The acting of these two actors is what makes all of this incredibly affecting, most especially Molly's coping with Sam's sudden exit from her life. She keeps his personal things, as well as any little scrap of paper or memory she can hold onto, with Sam watching all of this from behind her shoulder and Carl trying his best to comfort and console her. Sam soon pays a visit to a con artist medium named Otta Mae Brown, played by Whoopi Goldberg, who is the only person that Sam is able to talk to. The comedy of the movie really picks up as we are given scenes of Brown walking in the streets arguing with the air, talking to the walls, and having hissy fits with Sam in public. Goldberg is really given a chance to shine in this role, playing out some of her best lines and material ever.Comedy then mixes with drama and action as the plot reveals that Carl was a mastermind behind a murder conspiracy. Carl is in desperate need of money, and when he found out that Sam was in charge of a four million dollar bank account, he hired a hitman to have Sam killed in order to try and take over the account and steal the money. As he further tries to worm his way into Molly's life, Sam becomes more and more determined to try and find a way of reaching her aside from giving Otta Mae instructions on what to say to her. Swayze is able to give us a powerhouse performance here, as his character sits back and can do nothing to physically protect his love. He feels weak, helpless, and these emotions are played out brilliantly.The film won an Academy Award, one of two, for Best Original Screenplay for 1990. The script is a melting pot of many different elements: comedy that comes from the relationship of Otta Mae and Sam's collaboration, supernatural elements stemming from the ghost angle, thriller techniques that reside in the mystery of Sam's death and Carl's intentions, and most important, the love story that Molly and Sam live out, which serves as the basis for everything that happens. It has a little bit of everything for everyone, which gave diverse audiences what they wanted and made it a sheer success among people.Demi Moore and Patrick Swayze both give excellent performances that keep the love story going. They both have a chemistry that never stops or staggers the film, but keeps it going. Whoopi Goldberg is Otta Mae Brown, a role she was born to play and for which she won an Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress. Her comic genius and diverse areas of acting play a major role, and sometimes become the heart of the film. Tony Goldwyn plays the conniving Carl, and does so effectively. He is one of those few people in a movie that the audience can truly despise for his crimes, and when the ending comes, it is pure satisfaction to watch him get what's coming to him.&quot;Ghost&quot; is nothing short of a successful movie, keeping us enthralled with comedic, romantic and thrilling elements, making us believe in things beyond this world. It never stops moving, it is utterly original, and it keeps us at the edge of our seats as well as tugging at our hearts.",N/A

529755,"This movie supports the argument to rent before you buy. The premise sounded intriguing enough; James Spader is a burned out  Los Angeles detective who had let serial killer Keanu Reeves slip through his fingers. Now, some time later and in Chicago, Spader begins to receive pictures of new potential victims that Keanu is &quot;watching&quot;. This sets off a cat and mouse game of, &quot;can Spader get to the girls in time before Keanu strangles them with piano wire&quot;? Oh, one more thing: Marissa Tomei has the thankless role of playing Spader's therapist, and it doesn't take a rocket scientist to figure out she's gonna be the ultimate victim. Here's the thing; I love a good thriller, &quot;Silence of the Lambs&quot;, &quot;Copycat&quot;. This ain't one of them. It asks the viewer to leave all common sense at the door. When the city is alerted to the fact there's a serial killer loose, and they show a picture  on the news of his targeted victim (who works in a shopping mall photo shop),no one happens to call. Excusing the fact there are cops who know what she looks like streaming through the mall. This bit of celluloid pulp makes the Chicago P.D. look like the biggest group of idiots going. Eventually Spader and Reeves have what's supposed to be their big standoff, but the director has Spader playing it so cool we never fear for him. There's no threat at all so consequently no tension. Frankly I've seen more nail biting episodes of &quot;Murder She Wrote&quot;.There's also never any explanations of why Keanu is smitten with Spader. Just some quick speech about them being each other's &quot;yin and yang&quot;.

48897,"First off, I'm not much of a fan of Herbert's novel, ""Dune""; just as I am not much of a fan of the book ""A Clockwork Orange"". However in both cases I am a fan of the movies that were based on the literary works of the aforementioned, and feel that the films are actually much better than the books. That isn't to say that I prefer films based on literature more so than the literature itself - in the case of Tolkien's ""The Lord Of The Rings"", I feel no film can compete or be compared. That said the 1984 film, Dune, is as unique, intense, and brilliant a film as can be. Visually, this film is absolutely remarkable. I only read the book once, but this film really brought to life the images I had conjured. The acting talents are equally remarkable, and there are some big, seasoned names here. The special efects are wonderful, especially for the time of its release. The costuming and characters are fairly accurate to the literature, if not originally imaginative. The differences to the literature that are presented in the film work extremely well to complement the overall viewing within the time constraints, especially if one hasn't read the book. Even Toto's musical score (although I could've done without the electric guitar) is terrific. There is little about this film I dislike.I suppose the only draw back to this film would be that it may seem confusing and not descriptive enough in its story telling to certain viewers who haven't read the book - hence the TV version with deleted scenes and narrative added. Frankly, though, I really don't see what people find so confusing about this film. Read the book. I can tell you you'll be a lot more confused by the literature than this film! Besides, mystery makes for a much better experience.The big question I have about this marvelous film is how much responsibility did David Lynch exercise in his direction? I heard from a previous employee of Mr. Lynch's that David was called in at ""the last minute"" to piece everything together. The sets, storyboard, costuming, actors, production and effects staff, etc. had already been assembled ere he arrived. Hmmmm....If you're a fan of fantasy and science fiction, Dune the film is a must see, no matter who directed it.",N/A
71223,"Yes, this is a real gobbler of a movie, but it might have been okay if it were not just another vehicle for Arnold Schwartzenegger.  Arnold, whose emotional range goes from A to B even at the best of times, displays his complete lack of any acting ability at all in a manner that begs the question why Peter Hyams bothered to make the movie at all.  Someone else in the role of Jericho might have been able to make the picture work, but it would have to have been someone of the caliber of Spencer Tracy or perhaps Rod Steiger-- who plays a minor supporting role-- in order to do it.  Poor Mr. Steiger looks embarrassed to be in the film, as well he might.  The movie is an embarrassment to everyone in it.  Except Arnold possibly, and only because when one's only acting method is a gun, everything looks like a shooting range target.  Arnold shoots his guns a lot and grimaces, which is pretty standard.  That said, there are some things that do work fairly well in this movie.  Gabriel Byrne does just fine as the incarnate Satan.  He has some fine moments in the film.  He is pretty much the only one, however, who gets fine moments.  There is a great scene with Jericho and the  incarnate Evil One, where Evil tries to buy Jericho's cooperation.  It is totally wasted with Arnold as the tormented alcoholic hero, because Arnold has no emotional range, but one can see by Gabriel Byrne's attempts to give Arnold something to play off of, that almost any other actor could have made that scene work. One can see a structure there that had potential; alas, however, completely wasted.  Robin Tunney, the damsel in distress, does her best but there is no sense that she is in  desperate self-conflict.  This is absolutely essential to the emotional impact of the story, but it is completely absent.  She screams a lot and looks moderately fetching, and that's about it.  Although the pretense and the rationale for the whole story is contrived and silly, this in itself is not enough to make a movie a failure.  It fails because of the actors [Arnold the hero and Robin Tunney the heroine] and is a textbook example of how important a professional performance is to a film. Without it, a movie like this is all boom and crash, growl and magazine click, grunt and obscene finger gestures-- not worth your time or your money, unless you use it to study failure and learn from it.",N/A
476691,"Volume 10 of the original &quot;Star Trek&quot; DVD series offers up one sure hit and one miss. There is a sense in which &quot;Arena&quot; proves how good Star Trek was, because, well, this is Captain Kirk fighting a guy in a lizard suit (and William Shatner is now 70!). After an unknown ship attacks Cestus III, the Enterprise heads off in hot pursuit. But just as they are about to attack both ships find themselves suddenly frozen in space by the Metrons, a powerful species that refuses to allow violence on their turf. Instead they will let the two captains fight each other on a barren planet: the winner goes home while the loser's ship will be destroyed. Thus Kirk comes face to face with a Gorn in a battle of agility and intelligence versus physical strength and endurance. True, the costume for the Gorn is rather simple, but we do learn the ingredients for gunpowder in this episode, so it has that educational side. This is certainly a memorable &quot;Star Trek&quot; episode. It is not on my personal Top 10 list, but it is close.On the other hand, &quot;The Alternative Factor&quot; is one of those great science fiction ideas that just fails to translate into an effective episode. The Enterprise comes across a strange craft and an agitated being named Lazarus, who claims to be chasing an evil enemy he must destroy. Lazarus insists Kirk must help and when the captain refuses, the strange visitor steals what he needs any way. When Kirk follows he encounters the &quot;evil enemy&quot; of which Lazarus spoke, he turns out to be some sort of &quot;twin&quot; of Lazarus and a very reasonable being. Apparently Lazarus' people have discovered a corridor between the matter and anti-matter universes. When the first Lazarus discovered he had a twin, he went insane. Even more alarming, if the two meet outside the corridor, they will destroy both universes. This would not be a good thing. I have to admit that this is one of those times when I think the logical thing to do would be to simply zap one of the two Lazaruses and avoid the potential destruction of absolutely everything. But that is just me and apparently Kirk was not going to learn this particular bit of wisdom until &quot;The City on the Edge of Forever.&quot; &quot;The Alternative Factor&quot; is long on talk and short on action and is a lesser than stellar Star Trek episode.

53154,"Although not quite as thrilling as his previous pieces, Martin Scorsese still scores with a ""Goodfellas"" goes to Vegas film.I put it this way simply because, part of the appeal is visiting with so much of the same cast as 1990's ""Goodfellas"". Robert DeNiro is our leading man this time, as Sam ""Ace"" Rothstein a character based on the real Frank Rosenthal who'd been there, done that.  Joe Pesci plays an eerily similar character to his ""Tommy DeVito"" sociopath from ""Goodfellas"", as Sams associate with whom NO sane person should associate.Other fun ""mobster"" character actors like Frank Vincent are on tap too.  I personally think Frank is terrific, and has a wonderful presence and look with all that thick silver hair.  He reminds me a bit of Dennis Farina, another great actor who is far more famous.  Frank was classic as ""Billy Batts"" in ""Goodfellas"" and I enjoyed him here as well.  I wish we'd see him more often.The true original, James Woods, effectively plays the smarmy ex-lover to Sharon Stone's ""Ginger"", a Vegas hustler, who marries Sam (DeNiro) for his money and connections.  Love has nothing to do with this marriage as we soon see, when Ginger continues to love  Woods, and much worse.  Stone is believable, albeit melodramatic to the max, as she  entertainingly deteriorates in her marriage to DeNiro.  She deserved her award for this performance.Despite all the good factored into this film, something is intangibly missing here when you compare to ""Goodfellas."" That's why a ""Casino"", great as it is, is so similarly done and themed, it  seems to pale in comparison. I think if we didn't have ""Goodfellas"" to compare ""Casino"" to this one, it would stand out on its own as an original masterpiece.  However, since it's the same director, similar and terrific soundtrack used in the same fashion, nearly identical cast, and mobster theme...you can't HELP but compare!  You kind of feel like Scorsese said, well, it worked once, so let's change a few elements, give the movie a new name, and have ""Goodfellas Revisited.""If ""Casino"" had been first, would we think ""Goodfellas""  paled by comparison?

587512,"My wife and I saw this movie just last night and it was a very effective thriller, which is exactly what it was supposed to be. And let me warn everyone reading this that if you are a Ripper historian you will be dissappointed, you'd be much better off watching a Discovery channel special. The movie does present most of the murders and facts the way they actually happend but it's Hollywood and so they also changed a few things but, as I previously stated this was never supposed to be a documentary, if you can get over the fact that it's just a very well made thriller you should enjoy yourself emensely. Johnny Depp (Whom I didn't even like until I saw &quot;Sleepy Hollow&quot;) is superb as Inspector Abeline and the man who plays the Ripper does an equally good job as well. In closing let me say that if all you want from this movie is blood and guts, you're likely to be dissappointed there too, because while there is plenty blood on hand (especially the Rippers) this movie also takes time to build it's plot too.  So if you want a good creepy story, I highly recommend seeing this, you won't be dissappointed.",From Hell

25155,"This visually stunning 1971 movie anticipates many of today's main social and environmental topics.At its core, Walkabout is about cultural dominance: the capacity of European culture to dominate both nature and other peoples. Central to this dominance - as the film indicates - are discipline (the girl's fortitude in confronting the outback), conformity to rules (her rote recitation and dress code), hierarchy (unquestioned obedience, even to a deranged father), subjugation of nature (wild animal slaughter), private property (the station in the outback, the despoiled mine), white privilege (the aborigine is useful and nothing more), but most of all, dominance requires replacement of instinct with institutions and nature with technology. Older viewers will recognize counter-cultural themes of the 1960's.Nicholas Roeg has organized these ideas in interesting ways that keep eyes glued to the screen. However, there is a real need to pay attention to the visual imagery which in Walkabout amounts to a dominant text, with the rather sparse dialogue acting as a subtext. Or put another way, in Walkabout Roeg is making a movie, not writing a play. Thus the opening sequence of imagery indicates reasons for the father's derangement and suicide, while crotch shots of the tree indicate the mating potential of boy and girl, a tension that is otherwise hard to convey since the aborigine boy speaks no English.Roeg's wise refusal to sentimentalize his characters gives the movie much of its strength. Instead, the main characters are treated in straightforward, non-judgemental fashion. Nevertheless, as other reviewers point out, the movie does make a statement. Namely, that the girl comes to regret her return to 'civilization', failing to realize at the time the natural paradise she had found on her walkabout. This rejection amounts to a telling commentary on the price the dominant culture has exacted from us in its demand for well-ordered 'progress'. While I agree with the spirit of the point, I think Roeg has idealized the contrast. After all, swimming, fishing, and roaming, look good from the standpoint of the closeted office in the big city. Yet millions of rural people to whom such simple pleasures are in some semblance available, leave those surroundings for the excitement only a big city can provide. In that sense, the girl's regret at movie's end can be taken as a coming to terms with the problems of modern European culture, rather than a return-to-nature as their oversimplified solution. Anyway, however you might choose to cut it, the movie is certainly worth a look see.",N/A

504162,"In a certain sense, as a Bach fanatic, I support anything that exposes kids to his music.  So my 1-star rating is a bit awkward in that light.  However, I think it well worth pointing out that the music of Bach needs no video embellishment to captivate a child's attention.  As a toddler, I was given cassette tapes of Bach's music, and listened to them constantly.  In a very real sense, from about age 1 1/2 to 6 I lived *inside* the Brandenburg concertos, preludes, and fugues, and the immersive experience has irrevocably enhanced and deepened my perception and enjoyment of music to this day.  So, consider allowing your child to focus on the marvelous harmonic intricacy of Bach without the concurrent distraction of an irrelevant stream of baby photos and implicit toy ads.  Who knows? Maybe (s)he will grow up appreciating such music as more than mere auditory &quot;scenery&quot; (to which category Baroque music has largely been relegated in American society).",Baby Bach VHS

Branagh got some of his friends together (you'll recognize many actors from his other films) and made this gem about an amateur theatre company putting on Hamlet at Christmas time!  The audition scenes are priceless.The script is excellent, the acting is wonderful, and--a rare treat in films--you will care about every character.  They all go through changes and become better people as a result of their time together.Michael Maloney is fine in the lead role of the director (playing Hamlet himself, of course; the comparisons to Branagh are unmistakable), and the rest of the cast give it their all.  A standout is John Sessions as the drag queen playing Gertrude. He has the most heartbreaking scene in the film.All in all, an inspired concept rendered beautifully.

It's such a good story, different, quite a diversion from the typical teen movies that are out there lately.  It is funny, heartwarming, and at times, serious.The film brings us back to 1983 - 84, and Sebastian Cole, played superbly by Adrian Grenier, wants to go on adventures.  He also wants to get out of school as soon as possible.  All the while, his stepfather decides he wants to become a woman, Sebastian's sister leaves and moves to California, and his mom leaves when she finds out her husband wants to be a woman.It is a little different and offbeat, but that is what makes this movie so unique.  The acting by Clark Gregg,who plays Hank/Henrietta is outstanding!  I've never seen him act before but I thought he played his characters with such great sensitivity and realness.  The performances by both him and Grenier, who I did see in Drive me Crazy, are truly beautiful and you can't help but fall in love with their characters.Sebastian is a great person who just wants to be good to others and along the way have what he calls 'his adventures'.You will have to watch to see what these adventures actually consist of.

456829,"Nosferatu unfolds like a languorous, disturbing dream.  The images have an hallucinogenic, archetypal quality:  mummified human remains in an ancient tomb; the figure of a woman sitting on a beach studded with tombstones; a dead sea-captain lashed to the wheel of a deserted sailing ship.Like Kubrick's The Shining, Nosferatu is less a standard genre film than a singular expression of a filmmaker's vision.  Writer-director Werner Herzog began with F.W. Murnau's expressionist classic, mixed in elements from Bram Stoker's novel Dracula, then set about creating a meditation on the vampire myth.  What would it really mean to live forever, and be compelled to feed on the blood of others?  What of the unspeakable boredom?  The longing for companionship?  For normalcy?  For death?  As played by Klaus Kinski, Herzog's Dracula has spent hundreds, if not thousands of years alone with these thoughts.  He is the ultimate poster boy for German angst.  If not for the skill of his performance and Herzog's direction, he might have lapsed into self-parody.There are shots that all but reproduce moments from the silent classic - right down to the overwrought body language. But Herzog, Kinski, and the rest of the cast (including Bruno Ganz as Jonathon Harker and Isabelle Adjani as his wife Lucy) keep it in check and keep it beautifully stylized, so it all works.Probably due to the involvement of American studio 20th-Century Fox, Nosferatu was shot in both English and German versions.  Both are on this double-sided DVD; comparing them is instructive, since there are non-trivial differences in the visual construction of both films.  Most critics agree (and I concur) that the German one is superior.Finally, to get an idea of whether you will like this - or any - Werner Herzog film, take the Armageddon-Matrix test:  if you hated Armageddon because it was empty and overblown, but kind of liked The Matrix because of its ideas, then you may like Nosferatu.  If, on the other hand, you thought Armageddon rocked, but only kind of liked The Matrix because it was slow in places, then don't even think about it.",N/A

Several double-dealing events unfold and DeNiro and Reno soon find themselves alone as the only trusting partners in the ordeal, and begin digging up old government contacts to find their betrayers.

495447,"These days a concert clip passes for a &quot;video&quot; of a song, and very few artists take the time and trouble to make a video that is in itself a piece of art, further developing and enrichening the song it is showcasing.Michael Nesmith stood at the forecastle of the video ship, sailing her into port with the production of this comedy album/collection of video clips, &quot;Elephant Parts.&quot;  Yes, some of the comedy is a little dated; some of it is just plain silly.  But Michael never claimed it was anything more than silly; plus, amidst all the late 70's jokes you'll find the extreme timelessness of his opening monologue, discussing the fact that &quot;there's something funny about the gasoline prices!&quot; rings hysterically true today, as does &quot;The Large Detroit Car Company.&quot;  The words of his closing song, &quot;Tonite,&quot; also speak to a 2000's audience.Enclosed with these comedy skits are five of Michael Nesmith's video clips, some of the best videos ever made in a time when video was truly its own standalone art form--made by the pioneer of video art.  &quot;Light,&quot; &quot;Magic,&quot; and &quot;Cruisin'&quot; are all from Nesmith's &quot;Infinite Rider on the Big Dogma&quot; album (as is the above-mentioned &quot;Tonite&quot;), with &quot;Cruisin'&quot; being remembered fondly for its quirky lyrics and a young Hulk Hogan in his first major role.  &quot;Rio&quot; is from the album &quot;From a Radio Engine to the Photon Wing,&quot; and was probably the first major video clip release (although groups from the 60's had been doing it since, well, The Monkees cribbed from The Beatles).  &quot;Rio&quot; is funny, it is thoughtful, and it is brilliant.&quot;Elephant Parts&quot; went on to become a short-lived NBC series called &quot;Television Parts,&quot; which would give some early television exposure to such luminaries as Jerry Seinfeld, Jay Leno, Whoopi Goldberg, and Garry Shandling.Michael has a bizarre sense of humor, and you do have to be a fan to laugh out loud at his director's commentary (which we did).  It's extremely silly and delivered deadpan serious, and I do believe you need a steeping in The Monkees, Monty Python and some of Michael's mid-80's work such as &quot;Tahiti Condo&quot; (from the CD &quot;The Newer Stuff&quot;).  I thought it was hilarious, and laughed so hard it hurt.To be honest, I bought my copy direct from the source...-- it's cheaper here at Amazon, but Papa Nez will autograph it for you if you buy it from him.All in all, Elephant Parts is a classic -- nothing more, nothing less.  &quot;First Grammy for Video Music&quot; notwithstanding, &quot;Elephant Parts&quot; was the beginning of the video age, spawning M-TV and its subsidiaries, VH-1 and CMT and GAC and all the rest of them.

Now Nick can either learn from his new gift, or use it for his own selfish reasons.My Opinion:  This movie looks so good. The premise of Mel Gibson hearing the thoughts of women is really intriguing. The trailers are awesome. It's even really funny and interesting in the film. Until they have to wrap everything up and end the movie. That's when everything falls apart. The ending is terribly weak. It steals all the energy and laughter that it had going up until that point. It takes what should have been a really fun and entertaining movie and leaves it flat.

The Farrellys always had, until now, a good idea of what's funny, and if they can be gross and funny at the same time, well, that's even better.  But I didn't find anything funny about the prolonged shot of the defecating dog nor the placement of the chicken where the sun don't shine.  I think I only laughed aloud twice -- at the bit with the cow and at the sloppy wet kisses between the black dwarf chauffeur and Charlie's ex-wife.  There were other good moments but those damn promo trailers had already spoiled them.  I think the involvement of scowling corrupt cops in the plot was also a misstep.  Not only are the scenes involving the paper cut-out criminals incredibly dull, but just the presence of a menace in a Farrelly brothers movie is incongruously jarring, and as a result, I couldn't sense any of the sweetness that was at the core of their previous films.  Moreover, the Farrellys felt obligated to wrap up all the loose ends begotten by their ill-conceived plot with a stupid action sequence replete with an albino deus ex machina.  As for Jim Carrey, he is fun to watch, as always, especially in those scenes in which Hank and Charlie confront one another, which reminded me of the hilarious bathroom sequence in 'Liar Liar'.  But alas, he was unable to save the film.  I should also note that hockey fans may want to stay for the closing credits.

Enid and Rebbecca begin to drift apart, as Enid isolates herself more, hanging on to her determination not to play any part of such a facile culture, whilst Rebbecca is slowly forced by practicality in to compliance and submission.  Enid becomes fascinated by the pathetic Seymour (&quot;He's the opposite of everything I hate...&quot;) and a poignant relationship develops which becomes the focus of the film.Ghost World was a film whose course was very much charted during its filming - Seymour had originally been intended as only a peripheral character.  But the screen relationship between Birch and Buscerni was so strong as to encourage to director to change the film's emphasis completely.  The result is, by turns, halarious, poignant and its own way, tragic.  Zwigoff is clearly contemporary culture's worst critic and his view of America is as glib, if far more human , than that of Todd Solondz.  And its humanity which gets you here;  despite their flaws,  Zwigoff has genuine compassion for his ensemble of oddballs and its hard not to touched by their plight.The films end is almost epigrammatic in its ambiguity - the Ghost World of the title a sort of dream existence which both Enid and Rebbeca have spent their teenage years floating in, refusing to aknowledge a terrifying reality.  The ending suggests that whilst Rebbecca has left this world far behind, Enid has forever been lost to it.  Its an ending which, like the film, has a perculiar poetry to it.",N/A

I'm trying to remember, but I think when Wayne introduced the film at Nodance (in the Main St. Mall, Park City, UT), I thought he said it was shot on Hi-Def... I can't remember.

Now I wish Oliver Stone made a sequel just to depict what happened to the golden boys during and after october 1987. Of course ""Wall Street"" has its own flaws, but it's the best of the genre and the success of this movie relies much on the shark-greenmailer-two bit pirate-Michael Douglas's performance (if only Daryl Hannah knew how to act!): ""Greed, for lack of a better word, is good, is right, it works... and it will save that malfunctioning corporation called the USA"".What I like most about this movie is that there's no shallow left or right wing propaganda. There's dad Fox on one side and Gekko on the other. It's up to you to see who's wrong and who's right; although I have to say Gordon Gekko may appear to be a much more interesting and charming character than all the others in this movie, as almost all the bad guys appear to be in the history of cinema.",N/A

He's a jerk in Jerry Maguire, I don't think he really loves Dorothy (is that her name?).I like Dorothy (Renee Zellweger) much more, but that just might be because I'm a guy.  I think she's doing a wonderful job, although I never really understood why she fell for this Jerry Maguire hot-shot.  I liked her part because she was so dedicated to him and because she wanted to be inspired.The plot is good and there are some really funny scenes as well as a couple of heart-warmers.

66398,Hitchcock knows how to build a sense of unnerving suspense aand with Frenzy all his prior knowledge makes this film one hell of a ride! A necktie murderer is having his way with the women of London and over the course of his deadly deeds more humor and inventive flashbacks are used to give the viewer an overwhelming sense of morbid pleasure! The film is shockingly violent but the story is so well crafted that you not only fall into its spell but at key moments realize you're in a nightmare! (...) Dark and dank corners and inter changing plot twists will leave your mouth open! The last 15 minutes have been copied to death but here is the original and the best. As it stands Hitchcock has made his most raw and violent film along the same vein as Shakespare's Titus!,N/A
539479,"This is one of the most enjoyable and halarious movies I have seen in a long time. I saw it the day it came out in theaters with my wife and 9 year-old-son. We loved the movie so much we went to go and see it again the next day and enjoyed it just as much!  Shrek is a very likable and reluctant hero who is well-potrayed in the movie. His mannerisms and facial expressions are so detailed. Mike Myer's famous Scottish accent fits Shrek's personality so well. I am sure he will be around to star in a sequel.  Eddie Murphy simply steals the show as Shrek's cowardly motor-mouthed side-kick &quot;Donkey&quot; who just want to be Shrek's friend even though Shrek would just like to shut him up in the worst way. Donkey is so funny in the movie! By the middle of the film, Donkey had me laughing so hard I missed little funny parts because my eyes were filled with tears from laughing so hard.John Lithgow was excellent as the prince with a Napoleon complex that does not escape the notice of Shrek and Donkey. Lithgow's voice fits the prince so well. His funny name will go over most kids head as will many of the jokes in the film( But there is still plenty left for them to get).Shrek is a fast moving adventure that leaves you begging for more but doesn't drag on. There is lots of action and some fairy-tale romance that the kiddies will appreciate. The computer generation is state of the art, dowm to a single blade of grass.  The only flaw in the film is that some of the characters moves like puppets sometimes( the princess mostly being the culprit). I do not understand how the animation with Shrek himself can be doe so well and not some of the other charcters. This little quirk could never tarnish the beauty of this film. Film-goers will just ignore it and enjoy the show, especially if they realize they have never heard their kids laugh so hard.Greego",Shrek VHS

465738,"That a film this incredibly profound and brilliant could come out of the lowest-common-denominator-driven politics of Hollywood filmmaking is nearly beyond belief.  However, I'm certainly not going to complain about it.The movie centers around a historical period of Shakespeare's life (the episode in which he is writing &quot;Romeo And Juliet&quot;).  The film includes many historical personages, such as the famous poet Christopher Marlowe and the stage actors Ned Alleyn and Richard Burbage [one of the most popular Shakespeare actors of all time].  The inclusion of Judi Dench (arguably the most famous Shakespeare actresses alive) as Queen Elizabeth was pure genius.The plot of the movie focuses on a love affair between Shakespeare and a fictional women (played by Gwyneth Paltrow) who turns out to be the perfect muse for S' writer's block.  The inquiry into what is the impetus for the creative output of the artist is fascinating.  In many ways, the movie reminds me of Thomas Mann's &quot;Lotte In Weimer&quot;;  in his novel, it is Goethe's talents which get put &quot;under the microscope.&quot;What makes this movie truly outstanding is that it's so well done.  It has the tone of a Shakespearian comedy - an utterly brilliant touch.  This movie could have so easily been a sham if left in the hands of a less capable director and inferior actors.  Paltrow's performance, in particular, really makes this movie sing.  The soundtrack gives the pace of the film a nice flow.Here is the type of tasteful movie that the cultured among us have been waiting for for so long.  Another movie like this won't come out for at least another 10 years.  The DVD also contains mini-biographies of the historical figures portrayed in the movie.  All in all, a can't miss.",Shakespeare in Love VHS
56328,"The main reason for reviewing this is simply backlog; I do enjoy Van Damme's oeuvre for the high comedies that they are, but this film really wasn't much of an improvement over 'Cyborg', which was possibly the worst film ever made (yes, that includes 'Hudson Hawk').Prior to release, Van Damme had been going around saying it will be a pure action film, returning to his 'Bloodsport' roots.  I wish.  For $20 million dollars cheaper, 'Bloodsport' makes 'the Quest' look like 'Best of the Best IV'.For starters, it's rated PG-13, so the action can't be all out--something we don't have to worry about when his films are rated 'R.'  Secondly, what little fighting there is only surfaces in the last 25 minutes of the film.  While as a director, Van Damme doesn't make many resolutely bone-headed mistakes, he should stay away from vanity projects like this one.The film itself is quite boring, and while it is amusing to see Roger Moore pick up his paycheck and run (it's been a hard life since 'View to a Kill'), nothing merits buying this on DVD.",N/A

If you thought that Armageddon was good SciFi, then I'm surprised you're reading this.  As a matter of fact...I would be suprised that you would know how to read, at all?!The plot, what little of it there is, concerns Tim Robbins and Gary Sinise who play astronauts on the 2nd Martian mission.  It would seem that Don Cheadle is the only surviving member of the first mission, whose purpose was, apparently, to build a bridge between the two peaks (wink wink to Monty Python) of Mount Olympus...or some such foolishness.But the plot, as in Kubrick's 2001: A SPACE ODYSSEY, is secondary to the breathtaking visuals of the dangerous crossing from Earth-to-Martian-space the crew endures.

It was a moving and touching story that illustrated the onset of the AIDS epidemic, and how it hit particularly the gay community. What is most illustrative and important about this film is that it enlightens one's awareness of the gay community. Real, enduring, and loving relationships are shown between people here, and there is nothing of the sensationalized or stereotypical drama one finds in many films of this kind. I found it to be a deeply emotional picture, and of particular note, the performances by Bruce Davison and Campbell Scott. It has been a few years since I last saw this film, so I have no idea if the story stands the ""test of time"". I do know that it had a profound impact on me when I was relatively young.

It is rare that we find this in film.  And it is even more rare to find it done this well.  So there is not a whole lot that should be said about this film.  As for the plot it goes as follows.  A hitman(Alain Delon) is hired to assasinate someone.  Things don't go exacty as planned and a manhunt on both sides of the law ensues.  That is about it, but hardly.  There are more than a couple fantastic scenes.  The attention paid to detail in this film is almost bar none.  The film was shot with very little light which seems to precipitate the tone.  And then theres Delon, quiet and poker faced, with his black suit, slick hat, and trench coat.  He is remarkabley engaging.

513495,"Although almost completely ignored when it was released in 1999, DICK is one of the funniest films of the last decade. In many ways, the film is a cross between the classic 60s comedy THE WORLD OF HENRY ORIENT and (of all things) ALL THE PRESIDENT'S MEN, but the result is completely original. Two self-absorbed teenagers in 1972 become involved (though all manner of coincidences) with the doings of the Nixon White House, and become key invisible players in the unravelling of the watergate scandal: indeed, they become collectively known to Woodward and Bernstein as the &quot;Deep Throat&quot; source.Sometimes the best kind of comedy is the kind you can't describe. Why it should be funny that one of the girls should fall madly in love with President Nixon--removing all her Bobby Sherman posters on the wall in favor of pictures of him, and fantasizing he sweeps her away on horseback on a deserted beach (&quot;What about Pat?&quot; &quot;She understands...&quot;)--is almost impossible to explain, but hilarious it is nonetheless. Almost all of the humor in the film is to be found in the characters and the situations rather than in one-liners--signs of true comic minds at work.The pleasures of this film are best realized if you've lived through Watergate and the early Seventies (which may be why the film was originally a failure--it tried to hit the teen market), but it's just too funny a treat to pass up.",Dick VHS

Harry is a maverick cop fighting bank robberies, handling suicides and finally chasing a crazed killer known as Scorpio.

It's the pre prozac and therapist era and Callahans controlled rage is only adressed through the mishaps of his villanous prey and his by the book department. In a sense this movie is timeless as hostage situations still affect our urban areas but with this cutting edge cinematic view we become somewhat disconcerted by our own laws and policies.

540196,"By now, most of us are familiar with the plot of &quot;A.I.&quot;--which has been plummeting down the box-office charts since its release a few weeks ago.Haley Joel Osment plays a boy--or, rather a robot that looks exactly like a human boy--who is capable of love after an &quot;imprinting protocol&quot; takes place that allows him to focus his love on particular adults.  He is adopted by the Swintons, who at first are skeptical (their own biological son has been cryogenically frozen, waiting for a cure to his own illness).  It is a tense moment when Monica Swinton (Frances O'Connor, &quot;Mansfield Park&quot;) does imprint and become his mother, for you know that nothing good can come of it.This is the first third of the movie, and I was with the movie through this section.  Much criticism has been leveled at O'Connor for not being particularly maternal, but I think that the acting and scripting is relatively sound in this section.  In the second third of the movie, the boy/robot is dumped in the woods and forced to fend for himself.  He narrowly avoids torture at a &quot;flesh fair&quot;, where humans take out their aggression toward robots by torturing and &quot;killing&quot; them.  He also meets &quot;Gigolo Joe&quot;, a robot gigolo played with utter conviction and suaveness by Jude Law.  Throughout this section, the boy tries to figure out how to become human so Monica can truly love him and take him back in.About 45 minutes before the end of this 2 1/2 hour movie, the film comes to a good conclusion--the boy/robot finds out that he never actually CAN become human, and his illusions seem shattered.  It is a fitting, Kubrickian ending.And here's where the film goes very wrong--it goes on for yet another 45 minutes, ending with a jarring and false (and very Spielberg) happy ending.THis is an intriguing film in some ways.  There was much to enjoy in the first two sections of it, but the ending brings the rating way down.  Although Spielberg is undeniably talented, I very much doubt that this was the film that Kubrick intended.  If you are not expecting a dark, Kubrickian film, however, you will likely enjoy it more than I did.",N/A

The answer is... Yes.Steve and Goldie play a Married Couple having an ""Empty Nest"" episode. Their Only Son has Left the House, and they are alone. Goldie takes it harder than Steve does, as Steve has the Loss of his Job on his mind. With a Job Interview in New York, the pair head for the Big Apple, and the film follows their Misadventures through the city that Never Sleeps.""The Out of Towner's"" may not go down in the History books as the Funniest film Ever Made, but it Will Entertain an Undemanding Audience simply looking for a few Laughs. Goldie and Steve make a Great on-screen couple, it's a Real Shame that every time they are Partnered up, they are also partnered with Average Material. The Screenplay is the problem as it quite simply isn't very funny. The jokes have been Recycled from the Original ""Out of Towner's"", nearly Every Other Neil Simon film or play and from a Countless number of latter-day Jack Lemmon / Walter Matthau road movies. Some of the jokes even date back to the Bob Hope / Bing Crosby road movie days. When that starts happening, the screen writer should realise that it's time for a Rewrite or two.Still, It's Goldie and Steve to the rescue, as they Save the film from itself and make it Enjoyable nonetheless. John Cleese chips in here and there as a Snooty Upper-class Hotel Manager with a Penchant for Woman's Clothing. Some will Undoubtable find this role Annoying, Demeaning or just plain Stupid, but others will find it Funny, as I did. The Whole Three of them are called upon to act pretty Silly now and then, but they pull it off.Directing and Technical Credits are Average, nothing special... In fact, the Whole Film has a ""Nothing Special"" kind of Feel about it, no one except the three Principle Performers seem to be trying very hard, but If you Accept that Going In, you'll have a Lot more fun with it.",N/A

This film manages to convey that message by expanding on the original story: Whoville's population is obsessed with partying and presents to the point where sentiment is ignored or mocked--unfortunately with Delta House-at-the-homecoming-parade-style results when a young Grinch becomes the recipient of their barbs.  But the subtle cruelty theme is offset with Jim Carrey's usual insane buffoonery, like mocking his own echo, being proud of his heart shrinking, and playing movie director when prepping his dog Max for looting all of Whoville's presents.",N/A

I just can't take it anymore! The snobbishness is overwhelming.As any baseball fan knows, the ""perfect game"" has got to be one of the most exciting feats in sports. And I think this film captures it perfectly. If I found Costner's acting in other films not as good as I would lilke, there is absolutely NOTHING WRONG with his performance here....The eighth and ninth innings were made very dramatic and I felt like I was right there, watching an actual game! The romance was weaker than the baseball, but it did not detract from a very fun and moving experience.

326507,"I have really mixed feelings about this movie. The design of the ships, suits, rockets, and planet-scapes is really beautiful. The matte art by Chesley Bonestell really shines in this distinctly 50's view of the future. The script, however, is simply an abomination. The astronaut crew is filled with the sort of personality mix you would expect on a battleship - from the well spoken officer to the uneducated guy with a mop and Brooklyn accent.  These characters are used to introduce silly &quot;color&quot; that might have worked well in a WWII movie. The worst of it is the gratuitous introduction of religion -  the idea that &quot;maybe god doesn't want us to explore space&quot;, and the extended character conflicts based on irrationality - these simply have no place in a sci-fi move.Overall, I'd say this movie is worth watching just for looks. Very unfortunate that it was done in EP mode. A widescreen DVD would be very nice, but the sorry excuse for a script will probably doom this movie to obscurity.",N/A

520885,"As a fan of great science fiction (come on, who isn't), I feel it is my duty to notify the public of this terrible... of everything science fiction is meant to be, both from a story and character point of view.  First, the story of Red Planet.  I only watched the movie once (so maybe I'm not exactly the expert here), but from what I could tell, the mission that the characters were involved in was neither terribly important, nor worth the cost of human life.  Yet, as the Hollywood tradition says, one must spend much and make with the death in order to succeed.  For Val Kilmer movies, the formula seems to work.  Now for the characters.  I do have one question, why in the world would you pay for Terrence Stamp simply to sell him off like he was a used car.  Here's an idea, don't allow us to sympathize with anyone who will only been in the movie for 15 minutes.  Tom Sizemore has also seen better days...roles...directors...movies.  When you look at his past career (I know not everyone liked The Relic the same way I did), he could have had a much more likable part.  Val Kilmer plays a half-wit in a half-wit movie, so I won't torture him.  As for Carie Ann-Moss (of the triple name armada), she could be more monotonous, but only if this movie had a higher budget.  AMEE is a HAL-9000 type, so at least she has more character than everyone else in the film.Aside from the acting, the special effects were atrocious.  Am I the only one that thought the effects were terrible?  That matting on all the dark sky scenes is horrible.  It's like they gave a three year old the scissors and said &quot;cut away.&quot;  I hope that Warner Bros. can recover from this gigantic flop of a movie.P.S.... I wouldn't buy the DVD.",N/A
460089,"Humanoids from the Deep is one of my favorite Roger Corman films, right up there at the bottom of the heap with Death Race 2000, Galaxy of Terror, Battle Beyond the Stars, et al.  And since I'm a new devotee to the DVD format, my  comments refer to the DVD version of this classic Corman work.The image quality is good in most of the scenes.  The audio quality is also good.  And the ""sleaze"" quality is great!  Some of Corman's best.  But the movie is not in widescreen format and the special features are not too special.  There is a trailer of the movie and some trailers of other Corman movies, some brief cast biographies, a scene index, a little booklet detailing the highlights of Corman's career, and a three minute Corman interview with film critic Leonard Maltin, which is not too informative.In the interview Corman gives his not-too-original theory of how to scare audiences by not showing the monsters too much and letting the viewer's imagination do the work for him, a rule Humanoids seems to avoid, sine the mutant fish-men are on screen quite a lot.  He also gives credit to director Barbara Peeters, saying she was the right person for the job at the time.  However, he neglects to mention that both she and Ann Turkel, the female lead, both publicly denounced the movie and disavowed their parts in it, saying that Corman had turned it into ""a T &amp; A flick!""Barbara Peeters had directed at least one other Corman movie before Humanoids, so she should have known what was expected of her.  Evidently she and Turkel thought they were making a serious ecological disaster type movie, and were incensed when Corman brought in another director to add the nudity and rape scenes!  Not surprisingly, since she failed to live down to his expectations, Peeters never directed another Corman film.  She went into TV work instead.During the production of this film, someone suggested that, for comic relief, one of the humanoids should be gay, and be seen attacking a male citizen of the small fishing village of Noyo, but Corman nixed the idea, saying, with a straight face, ""There are no homosexual humanoids!""As to the movie itself, the cast is good: Vic Morrow, near the tragic end of his career, is very villainous; Doug McClure, always competent, is stalwart and brave; Ann Turkel is beautiful and resolute as the lady scientist; Cindy Weintraub is beautiful and courageous as McClure's wife.

375983,"After I had bought the tape of this movie I realized that I had seen this movie some time ago, and, although I raley watch most films more than onec, the perfomances by Sigourney Weaver and Ben Kingsley are outstanding.This movie is almost like an emotional play, we have one scene, an isolated house on the cliffs of the seashore, and three characters. Period.... It's probably for that reason that you won't see this film cut on DVD because I don't think it was a project for the masses but probably a project of the director, Polanski, and the actors to show their fabulous range of acting skill. In the case of Sigourney she shows us a lot more than we got in her Alien movies since she does appear totally nude ina bedroom scene from the wait up. Even that scene was critical for us to note the cigar burn scars on her left breast......Ben Kingsley's acting as the wicked DR is absolutely superb (I mean do you expect any less of him) and, although he never managed to convince me of his possible innocence, his acting made everything seem so much like real life ....Weavers portayal of Pauline, the revenging rape victim is electric from point one.

481539,"From the mid 1960s and well into the 1970s, producers Max Rosenberg and Milton Subotsky released a slew of successful horror anthologies through an English studio called Amicus (The Studio That Dripped Blood), including this little nugget of joy titled Asylum (1972). Written by Robert Bloch (Psycho) and directed by Roy Ward Baker (Quatermass and the Pit, The Vampire Lovers), the film features a number of notable actors including Peter Cushing (Dracula), Herbert Lom (The Return of the Pink Panther), Patrick Magee (A Clockwork Orange), Britt Ekland (The Wicker Man), Charlotte Rampling (Zardoz), Barry Morse (""Space: 1999""), Barbara Parkins (Shout at the Devil), Robert Powell (The Asphyx), and Geoffrey Bayldon (Casino Royale), to name a few...As the film begins we see a man traveling by car to what looks to be a stately manor in the English countryside. Turns out the man is one Dr. Martin (Powell), and the stately English manor is actually a nutter house for the criminally insane. Seems Martin has recently secured a position at the asylum, and is set to meet his new boss, a Dr. B. Starr, who runs the joint. On arriving, Martin is informed by another doctor named Rutherford (Magee) that Dr. Starr's had a bit of a breakdown, and is now a patient in the very institution he once ran. Rutherford, not being entirely satisfied with Martin's abilities, puts him to a test to interview four patients (which relates into a story involving each patient), and if he can guess which one Dr. Starr is, Rutherford will agree to take Martin on...the first tale is titled The Frozen Fear and involves infidelity, greed, and murder as man and his mistress make plans to do away with the man's wife (she controls the purse strings). The man makes short work of his wife by giving her the ax (literally), but her discombobulated parts seem to have a life, and mind, of their own. The second tale is titled The Weird Tailor and features Barry Morse as a tailor who's fallen on hard times, but finds hope in the form of a customer, played by Peter Cushing, who presents him with a proposition to make a suit (which ends up looking like a fancy Nerhu jacket) out of an extremely odd, shimmering material. The man also has specific instructions with regards to the assembly of the suit, the main one being the tailor can only work on the garment from between midnight until dawn...hmmm...sounds hinky to me. The third story is titled Lucy Comes to Stay and features Charlotte Rampling as a disturbed woman returning home from an extended stay in the hospital. Upon arriving home, she chaffs under the strict regime prescribed by her doctor, but her friend Lucy (Ekland) soon shows up, giving new meaning to the phrase `bad influence'. The fourth and final tale is a minor one titled Mannikins of Horror, and features Herbert Lom as a once prominent neurosurgeon and orthopedic specialist who now spends his days making little android like toys, believing that through sheer will he can make them come alive.One thing that impressed me most about this anthology was the amount of attention given to the linking story, or the wraparound. Normally in an anthology like this, the wraparound is the most spindly aspect, as its only purpose is a transitional device intended to string the main tales together, but here it's actually a pretty decent piece, one that develops into a nice little twist ending to cap off the film. As far as the various tales, I enjoyed them, but I thought The Weird Tailor the weakest. It had Cushing in it, which was a definite plus, but Morse, whom I like, just seemed miserably miscast for his part, and I had a difficult time sitting through his overly ethnic rendition of a schlubby, immigrant tailor struggling to make ends meet. The casting in this piece may have been a little off, but the atmosphere was dead on, offering up some severely creepy vibes, especially once we enter Cushing's character's home as the tailor seeks to collect that which he is owed. Overall it was probably the least shocking of the bunch, along with also being the longest. As far as the other stories, they're all efficient and paced quickly, wasting little time on unnecessary junk, providing some mild to strong shock endings. Perhaps the best shock comes near the end, during the conclusion of the wraparound tale, as Dr. Martin is pressed to make his choice towards the identity of Dr. Starr. I admit I wasn't overly surprised by the revelation, but it was handled well and was quite a bit of fun. I'd say Cushing's performance stood out the most, but then I'm completely biased as he's one of my favorite actors. As far as the others, they were about equal, although Lom did seem to stand out a bit, despite his relatively minor role. Ekland was odd performer out, as her only talent seemed to be looking good, which never really translated over into her acting abilities (of which she didn't have much of). In general, the performances from a mainly talented and experienced cast were solid, the direction very strong, and the production entirely agreeable. Some of the special effects in this feature will seem shoddy and quaint, as perhaps was even the case the time the film was released, but this didn't bother me as the strengths in this feature more than made up for the perceived flaws. Asylum isn't the best Amicus horror anthology (many say 1973's From Beyond the Grave earns that title), but it is one of the better ones (in the top three), and certainly worth your time if you have an interest in the genre.This DVD release from Dark Sky Films includes an exceptionally sharp and good-looking anamorphic widescreen (1.77:1) print, along with a decent audio track presented in Dolby Digital 2.0 mono.  Extras include an audio commentary track with director Roy Ward Baker and camera operator Neil Binney, along with a twenty minute featurette titled `Inside the Fear Factory', liner notes by Christopher Gullo, biographies, a still gallery, English subtitles, and a theatrical trailer for this film along with one for The Beast Must Die (1974) and And Now the Screaming Starts (1973), all three originally released by Amicus Productions and all three recently re-released onto DVD by Dark Sky Films (they were originally released onto DVD by Image Entertainment).Cookieman108",Asylum
671658,"If you like your movies pink and frilly, preferably with plenty of toenail-painting, then this is your _Citizen Kane_.  As a fan of the &quot;girliness is powerful&quot; film genre, I definitely enjoyed _Legally Blonde_.As lots of reviewers have said, what keeps _Legally Blonde_ is Reese Witherspoon's wonderfully ingenuous performance as the apparently vacuous blonde who turns out to be the smartest person at Harvard Law, as well as the nicest, kindest and definitely the pinkest.  She's wonderful, and the film has enough energy and girl-affirming moments to mostly smoothe you over a few doubts.The doubts include the fact that the film itself isn't nearly as nice as its lead character.  Gays could give this film a miss if they're tired of being portrayed, and ridiculed, as mincing queens, and while the angry lesbian character is eventually softened, she spends most of the film being a different sort of cliche.  And some of the film's apparent satirical targets (Westie air-head culture, Eastie uptight sorority culture, the expectation that an engagement ring is the highest possible thing a girl can aim for, to name three) turn out to be affirmed, not undermined, by the movie's end.  And the semi-serious end, where our heroine makes the graduation keynote speech (in praise of diversity) is crying out to be leavened by a joke, and it isn't: it's meant to be taken seriously.  We don't need that sort of TV movie ending; we need More Comedy, dammit!And then I notice that the jokes are often a bit small, and a bit too far apart.  When you're watching a comedy, mostly enjoying it, but you notice that the first gag to come along in a while has been a shot of the heroine's dog wearing a comical costume ... When the dog gets the best lines, or at least sight gags, you start to feel that the scriptwriters haven't worked quite as hard on this film as they should have.But I'm over-analysing, sure.  Reese Witherspoon's bright-eyed performance as a blonde who is never as dumb as she lets herself appear is a joy.  It's got a great soundtrack of California girl-rock, important tips about perm maintenance and the importance of keeping up with this year's shoes...  And it flies along having fun.  The script's nowhere near as good as girl-movie classics like _Clueless_ or even _Michelle and Romy's High School Reunion_, but _Legally Blonde_ has a star who is a phenomenon, and it has enough energy to persuade you to drop your critical faculties for 85 sugar-candied minutes.The best girl-movie of the Millenium!  Well, as at October 2001, and counting...  Anyway, Recommended for girl-movie fans.Cheers!Laon",Legally Blonde
672359,"It's a sad day when a movie makes &quot;Deuce Bigolo Male Gigolo&quot; seem like a Shakespearean play, but &quot;The Animal&quot; accomplishes that very quickly. Marvin Mange(Rob Schneider), a sort-of cop gets into an accident and is put back together with the innards of various animals. This seems like an extremely insane idea especially when it is considered that when given any new organ, large doses of medication are recieved by the patient and sometimes the body does not even accept the new organ. The reason that recieving animal body parts works in this movie is that it is stupid. It also makes no sense that he should inherit all of the attributes given to each animal. This movie feels like an extended SNL skit. Maybe the film would be funnier if it was cut into many pieces and shown on SNL but it wasn't.

The company believes that such a drug could form the basis for a revolutionary new anaesthetic.So far so good, but the book, of the same name, is better. The book is based on a true adventure by Wade Davis. Davis did find the natural poison, but unlike the movie it was not blown in his face, inducing paralysis, nor was he buried alive. But I'm running ahead of the story and the movie is quite good at what it is - a suspenseful, psychological, horror thriller.Alan with the assistance of Marielle (Cathy Tyson) and a Voodoo priest Lucien Celine (Paul Winfield) starts his investigation. A lot happens quickly and most of it bad. Celine is a serious character and is there to highlight the importance of Voodoo as a religion and significant cultural facet of Haitian life. Dargent Peytraud (Zekes Mokae) on the other hand, as the evil Houngan priest and head of the 'Ton-Ton Macoutes' (secret police), is there for the horror effect. A role which he accomplishes with aplomb. There is a scene where Peytraud contorts his face into a sinister, smiling, frightfully evil countenance - an effect much more subtley scary and effective than any Wes Craven achieved later with spooks such as Freddy Kreuger and the ghoul in 'Scream'.'Serpent &amp; Rainbow' employs a variety of techniques for it's horror scenes. Alan had always been interested in hallucinatory drugs and from his earlier visits with South American shamans and now with his exposure in Haiti, he starts having visions - mystical at first then horrific. You would not want repeated visits from his dream Zombie! The visions show the psychological danger that he was in, but there were physical dangers as well. Paralyzed from the Zombie drug, Alan along with a large spider were placed in a coffin and buried alive. If the experience of a spider on your eyeball, with you immobilized and unable to get out of your cramped, earth-covered tomb does not send you insane, it will at the very least cure you of arachnaphobia and claustrophobia!This is where the movie excells - plumbing the depths of some of our deeply held psychological fears. The fear is palpable and the increasing helplessness and desperation of Alan's situation is well acted out by Pullman. The ending which takes the form of a confrontation between Alan and Peytraud set against the overthrow of 'Baby Doc' Duvallier is rather weak and is the only blemish.",Serpent & the Rainbow VHS

After watching this film and becoming more aware of the sacrifices that were made during this war of the states, I found myself proud of my former profession once more.

580301,"Fans of Jack Nicholson will want to include this budget DVD in their collection as if features young Jack in one of his earliest starring roles, circa 1960.  While Nicholson is pretty good, I found the film more interesting as a cultural artifact, one of large number of low budget youth films done in the wake of Marlon Brando's &quot;The Wild Ones&quot; and James Dean's &quot;Rebel Without A Cause.&quot;  All of the ususal elements are here . . . juvenile delinquents in trouble with the law, hot cars, alcohol, the &quot;good girl,&quot; etc.  Nicholson refers to himself as &quot;the Number One Stud.&quot;Brentwood Communications' DVD checks in at around 59 minutes and I've seen one source that says the running time for this film is 63 minutes, suggesting that there is some missing footage.  The New Concorde Home Video version possibly may be more complete, but it costs three times as much.  Regardless, the short running time for this feature (originally released as part of a double feature) definitely works to the film's advantage; the story telling is concise and to the point.  Brentwood also includes what appears to be the very first &quot;Casper, the Friendly Ghost&quot; cartoon in a washed out, but serviceable version, an interactive movie trivia game, a dictionary of DVD terms, and chapter stops for the main feature.  All in all, not a bad package for a budget price.",The Wild Ride
180636,"The art of dialogue is lost in most movies today.  Either a script is flat (quite often pathetic), or relies completely on traditional writing practices.  This movie restores my faith in American screenplays.  Everything about the movie is hip, inventive and entertaining.  The pristine writing is performed flawlessly, with an incredible mesh between all the players.  John Cusack's dialogue with Driver, Akroid and Joan Cusack is stunning.  Everything about the performance cries honesty.  I watch this movie again and again and every exchange continues to delight me.Though the writing/performance is what makes this a personal top 10 movie, let me not belittle the rest of the film.  The darkly comic plot comes alive and flows very smoothly from scene to scene.  It is highly intelligent, and in no way 'dumbed down'.

12569,"Character, directed and adapted from novel by Mike van Diem, is an extraordinary example of why Hollywood is out of the loop when it comes to storytelling in film. It is also a paradigm of postmodernism that, at a time when Hollywood is the sludge export to the rest of the world, a Dutch film about a Depression-era family is so refreshing and well received.Dreverhaven. In the town that he works in as court bailiff, Arend Barend Dreverhaven (Jan Decleir) is a name feared by everyone; his son is no exception. Jacob Willhem (Feja Van Huet, who facially resembles Robert Downey Jr. and Rufus Sewell) is the illegitimate offspring of Dreverhaven and his housekeeper, Joba (Betty Schuurman). After the night Dreverhaven rapes her (supposedly, it is never made clear there was consent) and she learns of her pregnancy, Joba leaves him and raises the child on her own. She is a stern woman who refuses Dreverhaven's proposals of marriage. They are sent monthly with a check and the terse question: ""When is our wedding?""Jacob grows up with the shadow of his father's prominence around him and the cries of bastard in his ears. Joba is silent to the point of being mute and when he asks about his father he only gets the reply, ""We need nothing of him."" He eventually does stop proposing and keeps his eye on the boy and his mother from afar. His work, in early 20th century Netherlands, consisted mostly of evicting tenants from their homes and carrying out the unhappy law. It is not a cheery story and van Diem creates a darker visual aesthetic similar to Von Trier's Zentropa and Soderberg's Kafka. He is amazingly successful and the film is shot beautifully amongst the harshness of the story.Jacob's world changes when -- after an untimely move precipitated by his mother being taunted in the streets with ""whore"" -- he finds a sack of books left by the previous tenants. The knowledge they contain widens his world and he studies them constantly, caring for them like children. He learns English and works his way through the `T's' in his Encyclopedia (the last volume he has) but the cold faade of his mother does not melt at all.He has a quasi-ambition to strike out on his own but he is really trying to escape his mother. When he's summoned to a law office regarding his impending bankruptcy the place captures his imagination and he gains a job there through a forward maneuver amongst a management crisis. Once stable at the firm he remains determined to succeed and continues his law studies, taking time to shyly eye a beautiful French clerk named Lorna (Tamar van den Dop), but he's absorbed in the cat-and-mouse game he and his father play, keeping him in the forefront of his mind. When on the verge of another bankruptcy, the ruthless Dreverhaven comes again asking  for Joba's hand and she tells him she will never marry him. She asks him to leave the boy alone, but he responds ""...I'll strangle him for nine tenths and the last tenth will make him strong.""Against this backdrop of fear and stern affection, the characters make their life decisions. In one intense sequence Jacob goes to his father and presents him with the information that he is now a lawyer. He is empty inside because he has worked for so long and is still restless, and Dreverhaven knew he would be when he pushed him that hard. He extends a hand to the boy and incredulously he responds:""I cannot take the hand of someone who has worked against me my entire life.""""Or worked for you...""When Dreverhaven is found dead after this confrontation Jacob is taken into custody and questioned at length. Most of the story is told here, from the jail, in a wonderfully somber and methodical way. Character is a remarkable film that reminds me why I still find worth in sitting in a darkened theater with strangers for two hours. A must see.",N/A

Greatness requires an originality that this movie just doesn't have, for the most part.The special effects were first rate, especially the heat vision from Riddick's point of view.  The space scenes were also very well done.Riddick is an interesting character, but they went too far with his redemption at the end of the film.  Holding hands with the girl?

92193,"The plot is unremarkable. CIA drug dealing, and mixed marriage of police &quot;partners&quot;. It has been a staple on every television police drama for the past thirty years, but seldom, if ever presented this well anywhere.It is as good a buddy pairing as there has been in recent memory. Glover is the old wizened cop, ready to retire (and taking care not to spoil his planned retirement to be spent as a sea captain by getting his butt shot off) Of course, therefore he MUST get paired with a suicidal Vietnam Vet (As an aside:  it would be nice to see these Veterans not portrayed as crazy, but as stable men for a change.  For example, lost in this plot is the fact that Glover is also a Vet, which is how the drug guys get to him in the first place.) Glover and Gibson start by not having a bit of trust in each other, but come to recognize their respective and complimentary skills.It is the chemistry between these two (along with Gibson's screen presence) which makes this movie stand up and stand out. Richard Donner has directed an action picture where the excitement was palpable. He had to interject some comedic relief, otherwise the audience would have left the theater wrung out like a bath towel, and he delivers: Gibson's tribute to the Three Stooges, the attraction that Glover's daughter obviously has for him (and Papa Danny's understandable response), the competition at the shooting range and the frequent clever repartee work together to keep us from going over the edge.But make no mistake, the intensity abounds. From the time we are introduced to them all, we just KNOW that the bad guy (played with icy treachery by Gary Busey) and Gibson are gonna have a serious showdown. Whenever they get close to each other, it makes the heart race. The climax does not disappoint, either, with the stable one seeking to kill Busey, while the Suicidal Killer (Gibson) is content to &quot;give him a shot at the title&quot;, and being victorious, is satisfied to just say &quot;You lose&quot;.It is darker and much more violent than in the three sequels which, while generally entertaining (save III), are not in the same league.

575353,"Having been looking forward to seeing the newly restored and remastered Superman:The Movie on DVD for what seems like ages, I was simply hoping and praying that Warner's wouldn't let us down when the film was finally released.  I wasn't expecting the film to look like it was shot yesterday, especially as the prints shown on TV and available on video were so damaged and worn by now, but I was hoping that Warner's would pull out all the stops.  So when I placed the double-sided disc of Superman in my DVD player, I was simply awestruck at what I heard and saw as soon as the credits started rolling, with John Williams' infamous theme sounding so full of vibrancy and life that you'd think he recorded the score last week, and not over 20 years ago!  When the film actually started, with Marlon Brando on Krypton, I knew that the people involved with this special-edition had outdone themselves.  Quite simply, this is one of the best restorations of any film you are likely to see, and having only seen the film on video or TV before, it was like seeing the film for the first time.  Hardly any grain is noticeable throughout the print, and the colours are given new life, with Superman's costume appearing at last as it should, with the blues and reds jumping off the screen with a vibrancy they previously didn't have.The new Dolby Digital 5.1 mix is also a winner, and has given much more edge to the countless explosions and action sequences the film has to offer.  It also works well during the more tender, emotional moments, such as Clark saying goodbye to his mother, with Williams' score sounding as emotional and powerful as it should.  Only very occasionally did the 5.1 mix sound as if it was tampering with the original feel of the soundtrack, and it's hardly noticeable.The countless special features are also excellent.  From the three informative and &quot;new&quot; documentaries, to the equally interesting commentary, Warner's have done a superb job on filling the disc with as much quality supplemental material as possible.  So, all in all, Superman:The Movie is a special-edition DVD that can not be missed.  Well done to everyone involved.When it came to the sequels though, Warner chose not to put any real extra work in at all.  Not surprising I suppose when you consider how much went into the making of the original film's DVD, but a real shame when you realise how much supplemental material must be available.Superman II, III and IV all have theatrical trailers and that's it.  Not even the soundtracks have been remastered in Dolby Digital 5.1, and whilst the Dolby Surround soundtracks sound okay, they are sorely lacking when you've just heard the 5.1 mix on the original.  Superman II is the film that suffers most, with a print that whilst clear and more than watchable, is now showing signs of age, with many blips, scratches, and color wash-out evident throughout.  The soundtracks also sounds the worst of the four films.  III and IV fare better, with both the prints of these two average sequels looking very clear and far better than they have ever looked on TV, video or laserdisc.The biggest crime for me, is that Warner's didn't think to put a director's cut of Superman IV on the DVD, as the film suffered due to being cut by some 40 minutes or so!  Whilst Superman IV does have many faults, including some poor special effects, it's nowhere near as bad as many claim, and I'm sure the full uncut version would be much better.  In the case of the sequels then, and Part IV particular, Warner's have slipped up.However, the sheer quality of the first film, makes this set more than worthwhile, and it's nice to have all 4 films available on DVD anyway!",N/A

It's a straight to video flick I don't want you guys to accidentally pick up on a boring night.The story is about trucks that, for whatever reason, come to life and trap a bunch of rural folks in a diner.  It's based on a rather excellent Stephen King short story, and is the second film version of this tale, he first having been the horrific ""Maximum Overdrive"", which King actually directed, as I recall.Anyhow, this version [is] even worse than the original and its mindboggling what can get made into a film these days.

There is a basic storyline, but the picture basically follows the carefree exploits of Clara Bow and her attempts to snag the rich owner of the department store where she works.The best part of this movie, in my opinion, is the peek into the culture of the Roaring Twenties. There are some wonderful shots of this lost world, including Coney Island (complete with some rather dangerous looking rides!) and an old-fashioned department store with clerks (it quite resembles Macy's in New York).Another interesting aspect of the film is the acknowledgement of the stark contrast between the free-and-easy existence of the affluent and the struggles of the working poor. Bow's roommate in &quot;It&quot; is an ill, out of work single parent. She certainly doesn't have dinner parties on her mind: she is desperately attempting to keep her infant out of the clutches of the Child Welfare authorities.All in all, this is a fun film and a great introduction to the work of Clara Bow.",It VHS

583709,"This one had me engrossed right from the swamp scenes in the opening credits.  Well acted by Blanchett, Ribisi, and Kinnear; a fine score by Christopher Young setting the atmosphere; genuine suspense and good storytelling -- it was one of the better movies I've seen on DVD this year.  I liked the way the possible suspects all seemed to be good candidates for the murder -- I really wasn't sure who it would be until the killer was finally revealed.  When Ms. Blanchett has her &quot;visions,&quot; those sequences were all subtle and put together very cleverly (well integrated within the story).  The one possible exception was the pond-side sequence (the murder flashback vision), which I thought veered a little too close to a made-for-TV flashback approach.  Otherwise, there were very many things RIGHT about this picture: Mr. Ribisi was amazing in portraying the disturbed man, the settings were authentic (it was filmed on location in Georgia), and even the Southern accents sounded real!

376242,"DRESSED TO KILL(USA - 1980)Aspect ratio: 2.39:1 (Panavision)Theatrical soundtrack: MonoBrian De Palma's superb thriller borrows the plot structure of PSYCHO (1960) to tell a completely original story in a manner which Hitchcock would surely have admired. The 'Pure Cinema' approach deployed here also evokes the best work of Dario Argento, though De Palma clearly has his own agenda. His script attends the fall-out from a terrifying attack on a frustrated housewife (Angie Dickinson) by a razor-wielding maniac who then turns his/her attentions to the sole witness, a streetwise hooker (Nancy Allen) who teams up with Dickinson's teenage son (Keith Gordon) when she becomes a suspect in the case.A masterful example of visual storytelling, DRESSED TO KILL employs constantly roving camerawork to propel complex characters through a series of bravura set-pieces (the museum, the elevator, the subway, etc.), filmed in breathtaking Panavision by the late cinematographer Ralf Bode. At a time when most current scope movies are designed primarily for TV - which rather defeats the whole purpose of scope photography! - it's a revelation to see the entire width of the 2.39:1 frame being used to define characters and advance the plot through an accumulation of visual tricks and counterpoints. Pino Donaggio's memorable score provides an often thunderous accompaniment to the on-screen horrors, and it's refreshing to find a grown-up cast (including a restrained Michael Caine) making the most of a scenario which addresses mature themes in an intelligent manner. This intense thriller refuses to sacrifice integrity for the sake of cheap shocks, but it still manages to scale the dizzying heights of genuine horror.De Palma and the film's principal contributors charted the film's production in a number of documentary extras included on the original US DVD edition, and while some of their comments may have seemed a little too self-congratulatory at the time, they also provided fascinating insights into De Palma's working methods and the motivation behind some of the devices employed by the director to tell his story. In a special section detailing his collision with the MPAA, De Palma wearily defends the film from charges of misogyny and explicit violence, and his views are supported by the likes of Angie Dickinson, amongst others. Besides, anyone who thinks THIS is misogynist obviously hasn't seen the likes of THE NEW YORK RIPPER (1982), RED TO KILL (1994), or some of the more squalid dregs from the Japanese sex-and-torture subgenre. Now THERE'S misogyny for you!!",Dressed to Kill VHS

689914,"An artsy, moody college student moves from scene to scene, encounters a series of talkative characters, engages in conversation after conversation on various philosophical, political, and spiritual topics, and as the circumstance becomes more and more mystifying, our unnamed hero realizes that he's in a dream that he cannot wake up from.  This is the basic premise of Richard Linklater's latest animated feature ""Waking Life"".  An interesting idea.The film has a very fascinating visual presentation: shot in real life, and later painted frame by frame by animators with the aid of computers. The result is an exhilarating explosion of visual excitements. An interesting new medium.But, as interesting as the premise and the visual presentation are, this movie rubs me the wrong way. I've always wondered whether or not a book from the ""For Dummies"" series can be turned into a film, ""Waking Life"" answers my curiosity. After hearing a string of pseudo-intellects having a string of mind-numbing pseudo-intellectual conversations, I am almost certain that this film is based on ""Philosophy For Dummies"". Pretentious and sophomoric, the film has the same depth of a first year philosophy major's term paper. I can probably get more philosophy out of an episode of Monty Python than from ""Waking Life"".One of the very loathsome aspects of this film is that it conscientiously tries to be ""independent"", and thus corrupts the true spirit of independent films. It rejects the very fundamentals of what make up a film. Sure, independent films are all about breaking the rules and rejecting the norms.

263567,"I'm going to mostly keep my review limited to what they've done with the DVD since if you dig back far enough you'll find my thoughts on the film (somewhere...)  Briefly though, Zardoz is really unlike no other film.  Its wonderfully muddled by an overly-think plot, and enough symbolism to ensure you'll never really get to the bottom of it.  I absolutely adore this film and have seen it at least a dozen times (I'm always showing it to someone.)The DVD finally does justice to this film--justice not done by the VHS or laserdisc.  There is a considerable amount of material that was cut off the full-screen edition and even the LD was cropped.  Now we can finally see Sean Connery shoot John Boorman in the head, as well as the shot where Zed sticks his finger through a painting.  Visually this is SOOOO much better--the hazy effect which looked like tape degradation is now clearly the result of cinematic techniques which look awesome here.  The sound is good, but it was never really that bad, so no complaints there.  The director's commentary is a hoot if not super-informative, and you can (as a bonus) watch the film in French.  Ironically I think Zardoz may even work better in French (but its just THAT kind of film.)  There are a few other goodies, but nothing really notable.  What's more outstanding is just the quality job they've done in reproducing the original film on DVD.  If you are at all a fan of the film, you really do owe it to yourself to own this addition since this is the first time we've had a chance to see it the way it appeared in the theatre since its original theatrical release.Lastly, to those who don't care for this film, the beauty of Zardoz that you're missing is how really deep it goes.  Sure, it needs to be laughed at--Boorman tried to do WAY to much, but I'll take that any day over the hoards of films which do way to little.  Zardoz actually does contain some greating acting and some poignant messages if you are patient with it.  Sure, it looks weird...it looked weird back then!  But films like this are a rare treat and the sort I enjoy tremendously, even if it isn't a -good- film in the conventional sense.  I think a phrase I've used to describe it before is an 'enduring disaster'.  Zardoz is definitely a mess, but it is a worthy mess--and so much more delightful on this DVD.",Zardoz VHS

28204,"Director Kanin has been called the Douglas Sirk of comedy: like the German auteur,, he takes a popular genre (here the romantic comedy), subverts it while retaining its pleasures.  This is a film which takes the conservative 'idea' that capitalism is natural and appropriately symbolised in the family, and exposes it as nonsense.  Having a child, making a family, being a mother is the least natural thing in the world, a combination  of cynicism and chance.  The film's ambiguous title suggests the character most in need of a mother is the bachelor, a sensational David Niven becoming, er, David Niven.  That the film remains romantic AND comic confirms its brilliance.",Bachelor Mother VHS

327871,"Warner Brothers 1941 &quot;Dive Bomber&quot; was one of the best aviation films of its day and the credit belongs not so much to director Michael Curtiz as it does to Frank Wead, who wrote the screenplay with Robert Buckner from his original story.  &quot;Spig&quot; Wead had been a Commander in the U.S. Navy, credited with starting the Navy's flying program until he was partially crippled in an accident at home.  Wead's story was told in John Ford's 1957 &quot;The Wings of Eagles&quot; with John Wayne playing the part.  Errol Flynn stars as Dr. Doug Lee, who decides to devote himself to aviation medicine after an injured pilot dies during surgery.  Working with test pilot Joe Blake (Fred MacMurray), Lee tries to find a solution to what is then called &quot;Aviation Sickness.&quot;  The best sequences in the film take place in the air, as they should since the film was made with the assistance of the Navy, although some credit needs to be given to the first rate photography as well.  Even the laboratory sequences have a certain sense of drama.  Flynn is his usual dashing self, even though he leaves most of the flying to MacMurray and Ralph Bellamy.  I can never get used to see an angry, bitter MacMurray having first encountered him as Steve Douglas on &quot;My Three Sons,&quot; but, of course, the actor made his mark in the film noir classic &quot;Double Indemnity.&quot;  In the end &quot;Dive Bomber&quot; is a solid inspirational film that tells the true story of men who risked their lives to gain new medical knowledge and even the Hollywood elements, such as a young Alexis Smith as Linda Fisher, do not detract from the vivid flying sequences.  Even without an actual war going on, this is an above-average action film for the time right before the United States entered World War II.  This is &quot;Spig&quot; Wead's second best script after &quot;They Were Expendable.&quot;",Dive Bomber VHS
153289,"Is Angry Red Planet the greatest schlock SF movie ever made? If not, it's definitely in the running. For starters, it's in semi-gorgeous Eastman color by Pathe, and shot by the legendary Stanley Cortez (Magnificent Ambersons, Flesh and Fantasy). It's got a memorable combination-electronic/militaristic percussion score by Paul Dunlap, and ""Cinemagic"" effects credited to Norman (late-era Stooges cohort) Maurer. (Cinemagic is really just a combination of solarizing and tinting to cheaply combine live action with painted scenery and pencil drawings.) But the really great thing about Angry Red Planet is how everything about it perfectly emulates the look and feel of a 1950s SF comic or pulp novel, translated to the movie screen. The wild monsters (woman-eating plant, giant blob-creature, cool Basil Wolverton-look alien, colossal rat-bat-spider [immortalized on the cover of Misfits Walk Among Us]) and overall art direction and special effects are consistently imaginative and colorful, if not totally convincing. Plus, bad movie fans can relish the ripe dialogue and acting (particularly the sexist comments and leering manner of creepy `leading man' Gerald Mohr); lots of deadpan, meaningless jargon/technobabble; and the bizarre ""Iris sneaking a dab of perfume"" montage (one of my favorite non sequitur moments in movie history).The DVD includes no real extras other than the trailer (I don't count subtitles and chapter stops) but who cares! As with most of their other Midnite Movies DVD releases, MGM Home Video gives us a terrific print of both the movie and trailer. Other than some sporadic very light speckling/spotting the print looks gorgeous: bright, sharp, and detailed, with excellent contrast and great color (well, as great as Eastman color ever gets, anyway). Even the stock footage looks better than ever. You'll never see a finer print of this movie until someone digitally restores the negative; it makes my VHS copies look sick.

192490,"""Anyone can climb Everest.  All you need is $70,000 and a Sherpa to drag you to the top.""  Not quite.  Even with two of the best mountaineers in the world as guides (David Breashears and Ed Viesturs) AND the trusty Sherpa; young, fit David Carter almost died in his attempt.""Everest: the Death Zone"" should be required watching for any Everest wannabe.  The camera is unflinching while it pans the dead bodies like cautionary sentinels along the trail---the garbage strewn upper camps that look more like badly maintained junkyards than the most majestic mountain on earth---a traffic jam at 28,000 feet (are you seriously telling me I have spent all this money to get to one of the most remote places in the world, to be one with nature, and I'm in a TRAFFIC JAM?  Yes.)The film has magnificent footage of the treacherous Khumbu Ice Falls showing horizontal ladders laid across yawning crevasses that must be traversed.  (What I want to know is: Who lays and affixes the ladders?)  This area is the most objectively difficult on Everest, and it is early in the ascent between Base Camp and Camp I.  This means it has to be crossed, not once, but many times carrying supplies to the higher camps and adds exponentially to Everest's dangers.  The camera work on higher reaches of Everest, including the summit is breathtaking.So what went wrong that put David Carter in peril of his life?  This is the heart of the film:  the effect on the human body of extreme altitude.  In a nutshell, we are not designed to survive above 21,000 feet.  No matter what your skills (or that of the ever-dependable Sherpa), you are vulnerable to hypoxia, pulmonary and cerebral edema, frostbite-all potentially lethal.  To add to the danger, if you can't walk out, you will probably die.  No one can carry you and there is no possibility of helicopter rescue if you are higher than 21,000 feet.  You are without support and very alone.The film has a great deal of scientific explanation with graphs and visuals.  Maybe too much for some viewers, but this is Nova after all.  There are excellent close-up photos of high tech equipment and demonstrations of how it is used.  The color is sharp and clear and the audio is first-rate.  ""Everest:  The Death Zone"" doesn't pull punches and has great integrity.  Highly recommended.",NOVA - Everest: The Death Zone

I remember seeing the movie when I was younger, and remeber likeing it, so I rented this movie the other day (for my VCR).I just don't see what is so special about this movie.  It is a very cool story, I like how they go back to Scotland, and is a decent fantasy story overall but I would say that its somewhat dated. It was a little confusing as well.  Lambert was a good hero, but overall I thought it was a little cheezy.  That car scene at the end was pretty stupid.  Why did the bad guy have to bring that girl all the way to the abandon factory?  That last fight scene was pretty bad.  I don't know, I wanted to like this movie, and I think I did when I was 13, but seeing it now, it just didn't impress me.

But the real winners are Gene Hackman and Delroy Lindo who are both tough, experienced thieves who know the score--and know how to score.The cons are in place--a by now expected Mamet kind of thing--but they move like precision clockwork and do exactly what they're supposed to--unlike The Spanish Prisoner, which seemed to bite off somewhat more than could be chewed.  The dialogue is razor sharp.  One of the memorable lines:&quot;My (man) is so cool, when he sleeps, the sheep count him.&quot;Yeowch!This movie is a LOT of fun to watch.  The theft of a whole lot of gold from a Swiss cargo plane is not what you normally run across in a heist movie.  Nor is a drunk U.S. Customs officer.  Or a minimum of violence--until the well-deserved shootout near the end.The script is tight, relying on the war of words Mamet is known for, here put to great use in the most appropriate of settings for this smart (and street smart) ultrahip writer-director.  It's as though a character uses words to steal a little bit of the soul of another character he (or she) is talking to.

552230,"If you are looking for a movie that reaffirms our age-old grandiose claims of being the superior life force, then this is not the movie for you. This movie dares to make you think, and dares to go against the grain. The visitor is a female who gets assigned to earth; the dregs of the universe, to try and convince us that what we are doing on this planet will cause us to become extinct. She uses the frog in a boiling pot analogy. If you place a frog in a pot that has boiling water it will leap out. If you place a frog in a pot of water and then start the fire under it, the frog will stay in the pot until it dies. The Earth, according to her, is the boiling pot that we are in. Like the frogs we are content to stay in the pot until we die. The alternative it to take drastic action to change how we use the Earth's resources and stop taking them for granted.She chooses to approach a surveyor in the Australian outback. She decides that he will be the one she will attempt to convince and in turn he will carry the message to others. The movie then focuses on her efforts to convince the earthling of the urgency of her message. The bluntness of her message and its humbling nature will offend some viewers, which I think is a good thing. The fact that the alien character is a female will offend others who may think she needs to be ""put in her place"" as one reviewer stated. This is a being that can manipulate time, zip through distances covering millions of light years in a matter of seconds, so it is obvious that she knows her place. I love the fact that this movie offends some people. Indeed I felt uncomfortable in some parts, and that is the beauty of this movie. It dares to make us feel uncomfortable.The movie also makes other points such as our inability to handle pure honesty and how we play games. At one point she is point blank honest with the human, and he is offended. So she goes away, manipulates time to go back to the moment and this time she strokes his ego, which is effective. I love this movie because it is unpretentiously honest.If you want action, or if you are not into thought provoking movies then this one is not for you. If you want a creative, sensitive and thought provoking experience, then see this movie. This is great science fiction the likes of which Asimov would have been proud of.",N/A

When I finally picked up a copy, I was impressed by how many extras are included on this DVD.First of all, there are the videos. Some are not in the best of quality, but it doesn't matter. They're all still very interesting to look at. My only complaint is that the &quot;glasses&quot; version of &quot;Bodyrock&quot; and Moby &amp; Gwen's &quot;South Side&quot; are not included on this DVD. Still, seeing such wonderful works like &quot;Honey&quot; and the Nick Brandt version of &quot;Porcelain&quot; make up for that.Secondly, the megamix. It's a very interesting concept: put together a 90-minute remix of seven different songs on &quot;Play&quot; and put them to warped visuals. When the idea works, it's a great experience, but when it doesn't, the megamix gets awfully repetitive. Nevertheless, it's a very enjoyable extra.The &quot;Give an Idiot a Camcorder&quot; home movie really reveals a lot about Moby's personality. It shows his wit, humor, spontaneous nature, and, of course, his ability to use a handheld camcorder. A lot of the video is hilarious, but be warned: There is a good deal of profanity in the first half of the film. Parents should watch it first before deciding if their kids can watch it.The live pieces from &quot;Later with Jools Holland&quot; are the best pieces on the DVD. It's impressive to see electronica songs being performed by an entire band, sometimes even acoustically. &quot;Porcelain&quot; and &quot;Go&quot; are the best pieces on the DVD.Lastly, you can make your own remix of &quot;Bodyrock&quot; and &quot;Natural Blues&quot; on your DVD-ROM computer.

422142,"Most of the reviews of 'Marvin's Room' I've read online all mention Leonardo DiCaprio and how cute he is, how much he is loved, and how he acted wonderfully in the movie. I can't say I don't agree- he adds flavor to the movie and pulls off a very convincing act of a troubled boy. But the floor belong to Diane Keaton and Meryl Streep. I can't think of better actresses for this movie than these two- they're beautiful together. The movie is handled in a dramatic light; from the beach scene to the darkened scene where Bessie tells the story of her dead boyfriend. I don't think there's a better movie of family dysfunction.Most movies on family dysfunction end badly and disappoint me greatly. But this movie is a positive one, and ends in one of the best scenes I've ever seen. Here you have two sisters who haven't seen each other in like twenty years, and suddenly they reunite because Bessie needs a bone marrow transplant; otherwise she'll die. From that, they embrace each other hesitantly but surely; they realize of their love for eachother. They all depend on each other and grow from each other. Lee is someone with lost hope; and Bessie is the one who restores it.You can almost see Bessie's rare spirit reaching out and touching everyone around her. My favorite scene is when Lee convinces Bessie to take off her wig so she can cut it. Of course, anyone's got to feel embarassed if their wigs have to come off in front of anyone; let alone someone you haven't seen for 20 years. But Bessie takes it off with courage and hope; you can totally see it.  Keaton was completely magical in this one; she has rare talent. Bessie was the only one emitting hope and triumph in the face of death; and everyone around her began to feel it also. This person is someone I could never be. I admire this character. The final scene... whoo! The rays of light bouncing off the walls seem to be a representation of heaven and love. They all knew Bessie was going to die. This scene is handled with such finality. I would have much preferred the movie end this way than seeing Bessie die. This family is dysfunctional, but this family also experienced love and courage. To be completely honest, I was stunned into dead silence for the first ten minutes after the movie ended. Then I rewound the movie and started watching it again. I couldn't get enough of this exquisite movie. It's much more than a movie- it's pure reality and imagination combined. This movie is proof that people like Bessie exist. Keaton definitely deserves the Academy Award nomination. Hell, she should have won it! I love her. I love this movie! Go see it immediately!You won't regret it--trust me.",Marvin's Room VHS
531037,"......in my own humble opinion.Requiem For A Dream on the surface is not disturbing. It's intense and certainly shocking, but it doesn't get disturbing until you peel back the layers. Darren Aronofsky, along with David Fincher, is a director who is very aware of the material he creates his films from. The novel that this movie is based on is not about drug addicts. Let me repeat that, it is NOT about drug addicts. It is not Trainspotting. Requiem For A Dream tells you what it's about in its title. Dreams. Dreams that every single one of us have. Some of us achieve them. Some of us let them fall by the wayside and settle for something else. Then there are those of us, that are so obsessed, so ADDICTED, to our dreams, that we are in danger of destroying all the good things around us that we've created in our lives while in pursuit of this one solitary single goal. In Requiem, Harry, Tyrone, and Marion want to have the good life. They want money and success. They want to get there as soon as possible. They take short cuts to get there because the goal is taking way too long.So, what's the difference between you and them? That they shoot heroin? Are any of us addicted to cigarettes? To caffeine? To sex? To shopping, even? Anything can be a crippling addiction, anything can stand in the way of pursuing your dream without even you realizing it. You, yourself, could be standing in the way of your dream, and you might not even realize it.Sara Goldfarb wants to be thin so she can be on television. There are so many people who hate the way they look and will do anything to get the body or the face they want. Many do not have the patience or endurance for exercise. For many, exercise may not work, so they look for other methods. Sara Goldfarb is your neighbor, she's your mom, your sister, the woman who served you your coffee at your local coffee shop today.People are too quick to write this movie off, even those that love it, as a &quot;drug&quot; movie. It's not. It's a cautionary tale about letting your dreams destroy your life. In particular, the &quot;American dream&quot; that's advertised day and night to us. Selby understands this. Aronofsky understands this. Many don't. Not even Amazon.com understands it (read their review of this film. Especially their &quot;Is there anything in this film that any sane person doesn't already know?&quot; line.) It's only after you see the movie, and especially when you read the book, and when you peel away the shock effect layers of the work in your brain days, weeks, months after you see or read it, and realize that what happens to every character in &quot;Requiem For A Dream&quot; could very easily happen to you. All it can take is one wrong decision, like Sara's use of diet pills, or a belief that you can &quot;beat the system&quot; without recognizing your own weaknesses, like Harry, Tyrone, and Marion, to have you spiraling downward. It's that easy. It can happen to any one of us.That's why it's disturbing.",Requiem for a Dream - Director's Cut

The silly ingenue, played by Eleanor Powell, then goes on to bet money she doesn't have on her old horse at auction, but her producer boyfriend, played by the handsome Robert Taylor, takes pity on her and borrows the money to pay for her horse when she wins.Saddled with a horse that she can't afford, some sidekicks decide to help her by stealing horse feed from the wealthy, jealous ex-coproducer while the other agrees to train the horse for free because he is secretly in love with Ms. Powell.  All is fine until they are caught.  Miss Ingenue is kicked off the show and she quits seeing her producer boyfriend because she doesn't want to cost him the show.As if that wasn't confusing enough, we have a bunch of people wanting to get a part in Robert Taylor's show including a young Judy Garland and her overbearing mother, played by Sophie Tucker. The two run a boarding house for out of work actors, of course.Miss Powell is a wonderful dancer, unfortunately Robert Powell is cast only for his handsome face as he can't sing or dance, although he pretends to play the piano and write musicals rather well.There is simply too much going on here and I found myself losing patience with this cheesy musical.  The extra star is for Judy Garland who single handedly steals the show with her few appearances in the songs &quot;Everybody Sing&quot; and &quot;Dear Mr. Gable..You Made Me Love You&quot;.",N/A

The events that take place in the ep 18 and 19 (ESPECIALLY 19!) are simply jaw-dropping and mind-boggling, and the ep 20 is a very poignant start to the psycho-analytic drama that'll unfold later in the series. And I consider ep 19 to be the very best episode in the whole TV series. (I say 'TV series' because the ""End of Eva"" movie is just as awesome. Man, I want that movie on DVD)Heck, I think Eva ep 19 to be one of the finest and the most awe-inspiring moments in all the anime I've seen.

I was'nt disappointed in the slightest, in fact I have recommended it to many others.  The acting from everyone is fabulous and without flaw (although I could have lived without seeing Geoffrey Rush naked.)  The storyline, a semi-factual account of Sade's stay at Charendon, is fascinating and almost mesmerizing.  It made me want to see it more than once, and be anxious for it to come out on Video.",Quills

In pre-Columbine days, this story might have seemed a bit overblown, but now it rings with a truth that can't be denied.

143777,"There's one thing I specifically like about certain horror films, and that is those that contain the horror elements, yet have a story that allows you to feel a great deal of emotion for a main or secondary character, depending on the focus of the plot. When Stephen King wrote his first novel, Carrie, it was shocking as well as emotionally heart-stopping. Brian de Palma's film, following soon after, is groundbreaking and intense, and captures the horror of the character's actions as well as the horror of her secluded and alienated school and home life.Carrie White has never been popular in school, and the verbal and physical abuse has apparently gotten worse with each year. One day, she gets her first period in the showers of the girls locker room, and frantically running to everyone for help, she is bombarded by shouts of banter and flying tampons. After it is learned that she was never told by anyone about this process of life, we soon learn the reason why: her mother is a Bible-thumping embodiment of a true maniac, who believes that every action committed by man is a sin in the eyes of God. Her treatment of her daughter is extremely harsh, but only until Carrie learns that she possesses a special gift, the ability to move objects with her mind. Meanwhile, Sue Snell, one of the girls involved in the malicious locker room incident, feels guilt over her actions and asks her boyfriend Tommy to take Carrie to the prom. Carrie accepts, and attends the event despite her mother's warnings of doom and sin. But something much worse will happen, something more terrifying than Mrs. White could ever imagine.&quot;Carrie&quot; is one of the most well-known horror films of all time, and has set the standard for many later films of the genre. The entire premise for the movie is quite original, and the execution of the material is even more powerful and emotional than the novel itself. What makes it so emotional is the fact that there is a human story that happens everyday around the world. Carrie is constantly bantered and teased about every aspect of her life: her home, her mother, her apparel, and her demeanor, and it is done in such a manner that you cannot help but feel a great deal of sorrow for her when she commits the ultimate act in the finale of the film.De Palma's camera angles and cinematography add an immense amount to the overall effect. Many of his shots usually center on someone in the foreground, while Carrie is somewhere within the near background, making her appear minute and small among everyone else. His use of the two-window effect for the prom sequence helps us to see more of the destruction and the reactions people have to events going on around them. One more notable sequence is opening scene, in the girls locker room, where we see the rest of the girls having fun and making merry while Carrie is alone and singled out in the shower stall. Throughout the movie, De Palma does a spectacular job in making Carrie seem insignificant when put with a group of people.Sissy Spacek was brought to the project to play the title character, and does a top-notch job. She is the perfect &quot;ugly-duckling&quot; type for the role, and she is able to play out all of the emotion and terror that Carrie experiences throughout the novel. Amy Irving is does a credible job as Sue Snell, and her performance makes us believe that Sue really does feel sorry for what she has done to Carrie. The rest of the ensemble makes the movie believable, and never is there a moment where you will question the authenticity of a performance.Certain to remain a hallmark of moviemaking, &quot;Carrie&quot; will shock, scare, and incite emotion for years to come. It is a movie that operates on many different levels, each beginning at separate times of the film, yet converging in the end to sweep us up in horror and sorrow.",N/A

Movies are so poorly written these days and she seemed to be doing some of the worst ones... or just not necessarily exploring how talented she can be.  Finally, a movie that shows how funny, charismatic and appealing she can be.Heartbreakers is one the most well written comedies to come along in a long time and it is was perfectly cast.  Performances were top notch and hilarious around the horn.

673987,"I don't know why the other reviewers gave this title four stars, but they are completely out of their heads. This disc has so many things mounting against it, I wouldn't recommend it to anyone. Black Magic M-66 is really for those who are a fan of the old school anime, stuff that came out of the 80s. This title is animated in that style, and was produced in 1987.The movie itself isn't very long, only about 45 minutes. The plot is basically just this: army chases renegade robots, journalist chases army while chasing after a story. Everyone is running in all sorts of directions, and after watching it, you really wonder why you wasted an hour of your life. Basically if you are into slight nudity, lots of explosions and violence you may enjoy this film for the sheer cheese.Now on to the video. It's supposedly remastered. Remastered? Does sharpening something so much that immobile objects and people's clothes look like they are jumping off the characters classify as remastered? Colors are bright but they are way oversaturated, and depending on your setup they may bleed.And for the love of a higher power, stay away from the English dub. It is absolutely horrible. The actors made me cringe in their efforts at being army men, and all the women had very squeaky voices. The supposed 5.1 English track is just louder conversations, and louder background noises.

493107,"This is certainly one of the most unorthodox and best of the Hammer films.  While the title screams &quot;cheese,&quot; it is in fact a well-plotted, confidently-directed film that was well ahead of its time (in light of the subsequent appearance of such films as &quot;Vampire Hunter D&quot; and &quot;Blade&quot;).  It is also refreshingly low-key, making the most of atmosphere and an unusual premise, rather than cheap shocks. It may not be gory, and some of the effects certainly expose its low budget origins, but the sheer inventiveness of the film makes it worth seeking out.  It's the little touches that make the film great, from the inspired score to the novel twists on vampire lore.  And of course the unmistakable colors and sights of Hammer films. &quot;Kronos&quot; also stands up nicely to repeat viewings, something that can't be said for a lot of horror films.  I suspect that the solidness of the character-- part Sabatini hero, part Peckinpah anti-hero-- has something to do with that.  It's a shame that a sequel never materialised, but then again that means that we're spared the agony of seeing a brilliant character reduced to a one-liner spouting fast food tie-in.",Captain Kronos: Vampire Hunter VHS
38330,"Three unrelated &quot;strange but true&quot; stories-none of which have the slightest thing to do with this film-serve as an introduction.Characters who don't even know each other sing in turn to the same Aimee Mann song.People die; some deservedly, some not so deservedly.People go on living.And frogs fall from the sky.Welcome to &quot;Magnolia,&quot; one of the most unique and rewarding filmgoing experiences you will ever have. Like &quot;Boogie Nights,&quot; the previous effort from director P.T. Anderson (and don't think the &quot;P.T.&quot; nickname is useless; all his films are basically circuses caught on camera), there is a multitide of characters, all of whom are wonderfully conceived and beautifully played.Unlike &quot;Boogie Nights,&quot; though, the sly, hip tone is gone, replaced with an almost unending (and fascinating) series of vignettes about eight characters whose lives sort of weave into each others' in two loose groupings.Listing the characters, and the way their lives interweave, would be a long exercise, and besides, it would spoil the fun of figuring out the labyrinthine relationships for yourself. Suffice it to say that the central themes of this film-guilt, redemption, fate, and forgiveness-are built around a plot that is at turns maddeningly dense, howlingly funny, and sad. In particular, the ending sequence, which could have been a feel-good mess in the wrong hands, strikes just the right note of love's beauty-and its uncertainty.Say what you will about &quot;Magnolia,&quot; but give Anderson credit for one thing: he swings for the fences, and about 80% of the time, he hits home runs; moreover, you can tell that he and the cast had an absolute blast.If the other 20% of the long-ball attempts-the excessive length, the endlessly moving and zooming camera work, to name two-don't quite work, that's fine. The other 80%-including the wonderful work from the cast (especially from Tom Cruise)-is so fascinating, fresh, and genuine, that you can't help but be swept up in it.Invest some time, and an open mind, in this film and you may well have a truly unique film experience; on the other hand, you may hate it. Like the film itself (and life itself), the reaction you may have to &quot;Magnolia&quot; is anything but predictable, but that's the beauty of art and life, is it not?",N/A
682431,"There is little else I hate more in a film other than when a director and/or writer insist on hitting the audience over the head repeatedly just to see if we were smart enough to catch the big, over obvious message.  This seems to happen REPEATEDLY in Rock Star.In short, this is a film about coming full circle and realizing you were better off in the beginning than while you were on this journey looking for the proverbial &quot;greener grass&quot; elswhere.  The circling dialogues get repeated to the point of mockery, and the stereotyped rock star life is the only thing we get to see.  The film is so cliched, it is a cliche.  Perhaps this was the point, but it makes for bad cinema.The only good thing was Mark Wahlberg's performance.  How he was able to find depth and meaning in this absolutely vapid story is credit to his abilities.  For his performance, I grant the film two stars.  For the film itself, I thought it was the worst imitation of Almost Famous, Boogie Nights, and Superstar.  Jennifer Aniston's character as the suffering, supportive girlfirend is not allowed much depth, but then again, you can't help but feel she is just playing her Rachel character from Friends, just with longer hair.

466809,"Joan Crawford is cast as Sadie Thompson and Walter Huston as the preacher in this 1932 version of the Somerset Maugham classic.  Shot in black and white, the video and soundtrack are somewhat scratchy, but the quality of the screenplay and the performances shine through.  The mood of the film is dark and shadowy throughout, and the Pacific island seems hot, wet and  foreboding.  Even the opening shot of soldiers marching in the rain and singing a song about how they expected a paradise when they signed up but were now disillusioned, sets the tone for the piece.I never realized how attractive Joan Crawford was in her early days and this role calls for her to play both the hard edged prostitute as well as the newly converted former sinner. Both these personas come across loud and clear.  Walter Huston plays the preacher role sincerely, as a true believer who wants to save Sadie's soul.  Later, we see his inner conflict by just the look on his face, as his eyes glisten and he turns towards the closed door of her room.  There are a lot of shadows and a lot of close-ups and a lot of long, lingering looks between the actors.  This all works as a film and even though I knew the story, I felt the tension and conflict clearly.The only music was the ragtime of Sadie's phonograph, the Polynesian melodies of the natives and - towards the very end - an instrumental rendition of &quot;St. Louis Woman&quot;.  Also, given the technological restrictions of the time, there were some wonderful shots of the hard rain and rain barrels.  Everything looked wet and hot and sultry.

This film has everything that a great film needs. It has a story that leads the viewer in many different directions, a director that knows the true elements that go into making a great film, and a cast of stars too long to list.Generally in films such as this, there is one person in the ensemble cast that sort of sticks out for not doing such a great job on acting. Not so on this film. Everyone does a great job, it is just more difficult to find an actor that does a better job than someone else. Benicio Del Toro deserves the Golden Globe for his outstanding job as a Mexican official. Catherine Zeta Jones does a good job as the wife of a drug lord, and the rest of the cast gives hope that there are actually decent actors left in America.This is a film that should be seen by everyone. It tells a great story of the fight against drugs in America from many different standings and different backgrounds. The film never tries to be pretencious or preachy, it just does a great job at opening the eyes of all of those people that do not realize what a problem drugs are. After this film you will look at all the news reports a little differently. Steven Soderbergh deserves all the acclaim he is getting for this film.

549029,"Let me start by saying that if you are not a fan of Sailor Moon or similair &quot;magical girl&quot; anime, don't buy this set. I give you this warning because of all the people I have met, there have been 2 opinions on &quot;magical girl&quot; anime: love it or hate it. Not much in between.The story starts off just about where the first set left off. Hikaru, Umi and Fuu all feel about about having killed Princess Emeraude in the first season, so they meet at Tokyo Tower to talk about. Well, next thing you know they are sucked back into Cephiro, only to find it is in ruin and there is only one castle left standing. On top of that, there are 3 countries vying for the Pillar System (system in Cephiro where the Pillar (previously Princess Emeraude) sustains the entire world) and are poised to attack.During the course of this anime series I found myself glued to the set, watching an entire DVD (100 minutes each) in a sitting. The story is top notch and the animation is pretty high quality stuff. The only problem I have with this set is the color quality. The color, as it was with the first set, is kind of washed out. I don't know if this is the way it's supposed to look or not, but I felt the colors should have been more vibrant.The dubbed version is pretty well done and it seems as though they tried to match similair sounding voices as those in the Subbed version (both conveniently included in this set). I don;t like how they changed the endings for the &quot;English&quot; version, I think they should have kept the Japanese closings and had the names translated for us at the end of each disk. The 2 different endings are available as extars on one of the discs, so you can see what I am talking about.Which brings me to my next topic: Extras. There are a ton of extras with this set, they even have a storyboard for the opening animation where it plays the opening theme while showing the story boards. If there is one place they skimped on with the first set it was extras. They have rectified this situation. My favorite extra is the outtakes where Umi says &quot;Will you just die alredy?&quot;If you are a fan of the previous set or a fan of &quot;magical girl&quot; anime, pick this set up right away. You won't be disappointed. If you have no idea what I am talking about, first watch an episode of Sailor Moon. If watch it and like it, buy this set. Otherwise steer clear.",N/A
580491,"Shadow of the Vampire (E. Elias Merhige, 2000)Elias Merhige's first film, Begotten, is one of Nicolas Cage's favorite movies. So when Cage started up his production company and financed his first flick, he called Merhige. He had other reasons, of course, but the rather tenuous connection has caused a number of people who have seen both movies to ask why Merhige came out of semi-retirement (and a lucrative business designing stage sets and directnig creepy videos for Marilyn Manson) to work on a film that's as commercially accessible as Begotten was commercially deadly?The obvious reason that no one seems to have come up with is that Merhige is one of only two living directors who's made a major silent film, and Mel Brooks would have been inappropriate for the material. The less obvious reason is that Merhige's favorite trope, the long repetition cut, makes itself known in this movie. It's far more subtle than it was in Begotten-- no ten-minute shots of robed figures dragging Son of Earth up a hill in this one. But as in Begotten, there are long, loving shots of landscape (and I use the term loosely; the most noticeable shot like this focuses on different parts of the train for a few minutes) with action going on around them that has nothing, really to do with the landscape whatsoever. The juxtaposition is just out-of-kilter enough to add a veneer of disturbance. With the increased action in this film, the viewer is less compelled to focus on the juxtaposition, and thus less disturbed; but for this film, in the back of the mind is enough.Much has been made (and very rightly so) of Willem Dafoe's portrayal of Count Orlok, who takes on the persona of character actor Max Schreck through a shady deal with obsessed film director F. W. Murnau (John Malkovich). Dafoe does a fantastic job not only of playing Count Orlok as a vampire who's forced by his own greed into contact with humans he can't kill, but he also takes the silent-film exaggeration of statement and uses it in a sound film. It's unexpected, and it's wonderful. Dafoe is quite deserving of his Best Supporting Actor nomination, but if you're a betting man, remember that Dafoe was overlooked for his two finest roles (in The Last Temptation of Christ and To Live and Die in L.A.).All the flap over Dafoe's brilliance has unfortunately eclipsed some of the minor performances in the movie which are equally as brilliant, e.g. Udo Kier as the perpetually-stressed producer Albin Grau, Catherine McCormack as the spoiled and bitchy star of the film, Eddie Izzard as her co-star, and Cary Elwes as a replacement cameraman (after the original, played by Ronan Vibert, is sent to the hospital thanks to Orlok's inability to, erm, contain himself) whose arrival on the scene is the catalyst that sets everything in motion.Elwes' role, and the way his arrival changes the dynamic of the film set, is the one piece of this film that elevates it from an amusing, hyperbolic character sketch of a director who will go to any lengths to get his film and a piece of art. While Elwes himself is about as subtle as a cold chisel to the ear, the effects of his coming are masked by his (and those around him) aping until the final scene, when the true implications of the whole mess come to light. The final scene is so beautifully set up, and so well constructed, that the payoff would have been worth any number of errors. Fortunately, we have very few to contend with, most of which have nothing to do with the film itself (the person who composed the main title credits, for example, should be exiled from Hollywood forevermore).As a side note, the actual scenes we see Murnau directing are quite close to the scenes in the original. Given the flights of fantasy used in other parts of the film, this is a detail that could have easily been overlooked, but it wasn't. Kudos.While it's not Begotten-- nothing that's come out since has equaled the artistry and beauty of Begotten-- one can't say by any means that Merhige cound himself in a sophomore slump. To the contrary, the accessibility, the likability, of this film is astonishing, given the endurance-test qualities of Begotten. Very highly recommended. ****",Shadow of the Vampire
181506,"Judge Dread was just another stepping stone in Stallones long ride to the bottom.  As must would expect, the film lacks much of a plot and is full of irritating dialogue and some very mediocer performances.  Of course, people who go to see this film are going to go for the action and special effects.In the latter category, Judge Dread is competant if not amazing.  The visuals are fairly good but really nothing that is going to knock your socks off.Unfortunatly, the films main draw, the action sequences, are un-involving and tedious.  If you're expecting anything along the lines of a Face Off or Die Hard then you are going to be seriously disapointed.I've heard people say &quot;Don't expect Shakespear, just enjoy it as a fun Sci-Fi ride.&quot;  The sad think is, even if you do ignore the lousy script and acting, this is still a weak film.  It's not fun and it's not much of a ride.",N/A
532833,"It's not a bad movie, but it wasn't good enough, either.To be brutally honest, the Dungeons &amp; Dragons movie let all RPGers down. We've been waiting for almost 30 years for the definitive D&amp;D movie to come along and vindicate us in front of all those stupid jerks in high school who called us &quot;geeks&quot; for playing D&amp;D. We wanted them all to see what we were so worked up about, and this movie just didn't do it.It's still a fun movie, though, and the DVD has some GREAT features like the &quot;maze&quot; you have to navigate to make it to the Special Features Menu. The actors definitely gave it their best (it's too easy to overlook Marlon Wayans performance as pure throwaway slapstick), but they weren't quite up to the task. Except for Jeremy Irons, of course. That man took this as an opportunity to chew more scenery than the dragons! The film needed someone more experienced than Courtney Solomon to reign him in.  Nevertheless, the first-time director did a very whiz-bang job on his first gig.  Bravo!I first saw the movie on opening day with 30 friends, fellow gamers, and spouses.  Our &quot;better halves&quot; were actually less disappointed than we were; they didn't have all their hopes and dreams hanging on it.All in all, the D&amp;D movie will forever be enshrined on many a Geek's shelf, right up there with &quot;Highlander,&quot; &quot;Blade Runner,&quot; and all the other movies that make us obsessive-compulsive fanboys.

523717,"I thought they did a pretty good job redoing Rome. I still prefer models, mattes, real set construction-- but these computer renditions didn't look half bad. Usually I hate the computer graphics in movies.The way buildings (palaces, huts, tents, etc) looked inside was real good. I guess the &quot;property department&quot; was responsible for that.Good action movie... especially the opening scenes with the barbarians. The action is the draw for this film-- it's a &quot;guy&quot; movie. Lots of hack and slash, military comraderie, etc.This is Oliver Reed's last movie. He's one of my favorite character actors and does a good job as a local gladiator manager.Joaquim does decent job making the evil Commodus almost sympathetic in spots.Finally, I liked the fact that they presented the ancestor worship/veneration that in some ways was more important to the average Roman than the Zeus pantheon.",Gladiator VHS

I will add that this simplest point they make is in Matt Damon's last ditch chance to save his relationship. Poker is not a game of luck. If you accept that it is a game of skill and how you play matters more than the cards you get, then you can appreciate the truth of the film.&quot;Rounders&quot; is more interesting when examined from the perspective of Matt Damon's character, who has two balls in the air and can only catch one.

67515,"As an aspiring screenwriter, I was really impressed by the extra features on this DVD.  My favorite feature works on a PC with a DVD; unfortunately it doesn't work on your TV's DVD player.  It contains a copy of the script broken up in chapters.  You can read each part of the script and play that part of the movie in a small separate window while you read along.  I'm hoping this will be an excellent learning tool for me.Now for the movie itself:  I loved it.  I wish I could give it four and a half stars since I reserve those 5 star ratings for true classics.  It remains to be seen yet if this becomes a real classic.  There was a line in Kevin Spacey's voiceover that goes something like this:  &quot;You know, it's been said that every day is the first day of the rest of your life.  And that's true of every day except one:  the day you die.&quot;  I was struck by this line the very first time I watched this movie in the theater, and I instantly wished that I had written it.

132685,"This, simply, is the worst thing I have ever watched. I did not choose to watch it. I saw it on an airplane. Madonna is without a doubt the worst actress I have ever witnessed. I should not even call her an actress really. She is without a doubt the most unqualified person I have ever seen attempting to act. Her greatest problem, I think, is that she just tries too hard. Either that or she does not try at all. Her characters all seem like caricatured extensions of her public persona. Perhaps she is affected by the fact that she is Madonna. You cannot lose sight of the fact that she is Madonna when you see her in films. Still, from anyone else, the viewing public would not accept this level of crap. The story is about a yoga teacher (Madonna) and her gay best friend. In a night of reckless abandon and heartbreak, she becomes pregnant with what she believes is his child (I think it turns out that the child is not his, but they do not discover this until their friendship sours and he wants to share custody of the child). She eventually meets and falls in love with Benjamin Bratt's character. It is all quite sappy, stupid, juvenile. I have never seen anything so contrived as Madonna's scenes with Bratt. It is a big waste of time and film.",The Next Best Thing

At that stress level, any girl is entitled to resurrecting her one and only imaginary friend.  Enter Fred with one problem.  Phoebe has grown up and Fred hasn't.  Though Phoebe is reluctant, Fred is unwittingly a great tonic.  Things start to happen!The faithless husband who is about to dump Phoebe gets a most satisfying comeuppance.  Marsha Mason, who cannot give a bad performance, is icily perfect as the mother who wants to create Phoebe in her own image.

A nice supporting role by Carrie Fisher who plays Phoebe's older, worldly-wise friend is well paced and lively.To the editorial nay-sayers, it only Fred that does these disgusting things, and he does them with the flair of any average five-year old.  If everyone in the audience hasn't at least pulled some of the antics that Fred did, I am certain he or she had far too sedate a childhood.

401786,"Airport '77 features a wide array of Hollywood stars, including Jimmy Stewart, Jack Lemmon, Olivia DeHavilland, Christopher Lee, Joseph Cotten, and Lee Grant.  There's probably a few too many stars to keep our eyes on in this story of a privately-owned Boeing 747 luxury jetliner that gets lost in The Bermuda Triangle and crashes into the ocean.  But the action and rescue scenes somewhat make up for the weak script.  There are some good visual images in the film, especially of the Jumbo Jet smashing into the sea!  (Very realistic looking!)  Lemmon, as always, gives a good performance, as the plane's #1 pilot.  I guess they didn't have room on board for Charo.

465157,"The opening few minutes are lush and full of imagery and feeling. The haunted look on Private Witt's (James Caviezel) face, the eerie chanting of the villagers, the trepidation that the girl had for soldiers and what they represented, the sheer joy Witt got out of simply being able to share in the normal village life, and the dread that he showed when realizing that his AWOL jaunt was up - with the arrival of the US ship. I felt all that and got the mood - brooding, surreal, something about to happen. I appreciated the symbolism too - the beauty of the scenery with sun and shadow playing across the fields of shimmering tropical grasses and the beautiful birds in the trees - the incongruity of it all in a battle zone.My problem is that after all this - setting the mood, creating anticipation, hinting at deeper things to be...the movie teased me and finally left me with a huge sense of what could have been. After the opening scenes with Witt and his return to the ship for Sgt Welsh (Sean Penn) to ponder over what to do with him, we lose track of Witt entirely, and everything seems to drift. The problem is not the storyline. It's very basic. They're on Guadalcanal and Charlie company needs to take a series of Japanese held ridges.I recently watched 'The Big Red One' again. This 1980's era war movie used a similar technique like 'Thin Red Line' - the voice over to narrate elements such as background, setting and what was going on in the soldiers mind (though not quite as much, nor as effectively as in 'The Thin Red Line'). There is something else that that older movie did, and did well, in contrast with this movie.  There are only 5 characters to focus on in 'Big Red One'. Sure, there are others that play parts but we are always led back to caring about what happens to these 5. In 'The Thin Red Line' the character we feel that we are supposed to care about - Witt - disappears. Others are introduced but none are really sufficiently developed before they are either gone or someone else is introduced and the focus shifts. For me, this is THE problem with 'The Thin Red Line'. Wheras killing off characters is par for the course in a war movie, you better make sure you're not also removing the one thing your viewers can hold on to; otherwise you've killed off the interest. Unfortunately this is a case of so said...so done.",The Thin Red Line VHS
569572,"I am rather picky about Fledermice.  I may be a redneck from south Arkinsaw, but I also lived in Germany for 8 years and was married to a Sudeten German whose grandparents grew up in Strauss's Austria.  We listened to comedy records in Viennese dialect, and saw and heard many performances of ""Die Fledermaus,"" our favorite German-language work.  This is the best version I have seen in viewable form, and musically is second only to the 1971 recording on Angel/EMI CD (also an Otto Schenk production) sung by Gedda, Rothenberger, Holm, Fassbaender, Dallapozza, Fischer-Dieskau, and Berry with the Vienna State Opera Choir and Vienna Symphony under Boskovsky.A German reviewer said this DVD was a typical Otto Schenk production where the players, especially the men, all act like little Schenks.  Schenk's influence is indeed obvious, but I like it, especially compared to the overly decorated and cameoed Fledermaus ""galas"" that stink up English-language holiday TV.  At least Schenk is from Vienna.The sets and costumes are perfect, but the marvelous performances of the principals and the incomparable music in a top-notch execution Kleiber evokes from an orchestra who grew up on Strauss would have me enjoying this almost as much if everyone were on a basketball court wearing jeans.  My one regret is that Fassbaender did not duplicate her powerful and velvety singing of 1971 that made her the Orlofsky of choice ever since.  Of course, the CD came from studio conditions, and this DVD is of a live performance before an audience (on New Year's Eve, as with many Fledermice, no doubt lubricated with the usual quaffs of champagne before, during, and certainly after the performance). Still, 15 years and not having to try as hard probably made a difference.  Orlofsky is supposed to be bored, but Fassbaender looks bored, too.  Still, she is great, just not as great as she once was.  Being not as great as one once was is something I understand well.Even picky German reviewers say that Perry and Coburn do okay with Viennese dialects, and I can vouch for this in agreement with the Munich audience's enthusiasm for these Americans.  If the other principals weren't so competent, I would say that Perry steals the show, but her Adele is really the plum role.  Well, it's the plum IF the performer is good enough, and Perry is more than good enough.  She has not only the voice and fresh beauty, but also the frisky energetic vivacity to make her the definitive Adele in my mind.  Coburn does Rosalinde (Blaue Eiche?  Gelbe Buche?) as well as it can be done, and Wa""chter is as good an Eisenstein as I have seen.  Alfred by Josef Hopferwieser, Falke by Wolfgang Brendel, and Frank by Benno Kusche are all quite competent, but the guys on the CD were better.  The ridiculous stuttering lawyer Dr.Blind is a role Ferry Gruber deservedly owns.  Another fine job was Ida by Irene Steinbeisser (Rock-biter), who has probably been teased about her surname enough already, so I will just say she could probably do well with Adele's role if Perry weren't around.  Schenk probably thought he was a bit old to play Frosch (as on the CD), but I thought Muxneder did fine.  I hate to disagree with a ""top-ten"" reviewer, but it wouldn't be ""Die Fledermaus"" without his hung-over morning-after scene (including a cheap shot of tearing ""31. Dezember"" off the calendar to reveal ""32. Dezember"" hahahahaha).  (...)Technically, DG did its usual minimalist job.  The choices for menu languages are English and (...) CHINESE!  The English subtitle translations are quaint and awkward in places, maybe what might have come from a studious 19th-century German schoolmarm who had lived in England for a while.  To be fair, some of this is almost untranslatable.  English gave up the familiar ""thou"" form of address centuries ago, but not German, so how do you translate a whole song and scene devoted to ceremonializing about it?  How about Perry's pun on migraine vs. margarine?  The German spellings are the same as English, but pronounciation is much more alike (both G's are hard).  (...)Some reviewers don't find authenticity important, but the more you know about ""Die Fledermaus"" and Strauss's Vienna, the more you will like this version.  Sure, the misery and poverty behind the glitzy uppercrust don't show, but at least the servant Adele gets her way with everybody.  This is a great Fledermaus for the 21st century, and I bet Strauss himself in 19th-century Vienna would have also approved.",N/A
118245,"I rented this movie because my wife wanted something that she would enjoy (as opposed to all the war/action films that I have rented lately).  I mainly chose this movie because of the actors, not because I had read the book.  Overall, I thought it was a pretty good film.  A bit predictable at times, but a good story.I thought the story concept worked well, and I really enjoyed all the scenes shot at the Outer Banks.  We used to vacation there, and it is a wonderful place to go and relax.  The only part of the movie I didn't like (and my wife didn't like it either) was the ending.  It seems like the director looked at his watch, noticed the movie was already over two hours long, so he decided it needed to end in 10 more minutes.  The ending just doesn't do a very good job of putting all the pieces together.Like some of the other reviews, I recommend renting this movie instead of buying it.

Even some of my favorite movies require me to overlook quite a few such moments.The Red Violin is perfect on that account!  Such incredible attention to detail was lavished on this movie, it is about as perfect as the Red Violin it portrays.  And let's get that straight right from the start.  This movie is about a Red Violin not the people used so elegantly to develop the character of the violin.  And I think it is a real testament to the brilliance of this movie that the entire supporting cast of actors can so fully develop an inanimate object.  The whole gist of the story is that a magnificent violin is born hundreds of years ago.  We are then on a magic carpet ride as we follow the great events of this perfect violin through the ages to the present.  That's it.  That is really all this movie is about.  Who would have thought that such a simple story could be so interesting, so engaging, so thoroughly original, and so uniquely told.The unique way in which the story is revealed is another tool utilized to make this story so fantastic.  This is high story telling at its best.  The auction for example, is rerun continually as we learn more and more about the Violin.  Each time, though, we glimpse a little more of the auction as we glimpse more of the soul of the Red Violin.  Combining with this, we jump repeatedly from the auction, to the birth of the violin, to the different phases of the Violin's life, and to the Violin's Tarot reading.  The effect is totally engaging and refreshing.  Bravo.The production values of this movie are top notch; the acting is magnificent, the photography stunning, and the music a feast for the ears.  The slavish attention to details adds to all of this and causes a total suspension of disbelief.The DVD edition of the movie is Anamorphic Widescreen.  On a regular TV the characters will look slightly skinny.  However, on a widescreen TV you will be blown away by the copious panoramic vistas that can only be truly appreciated in their widescreen glory.  This DVD lacks any of the usual goodies such as the Making of the Red Violin etc.  This is really a shame because I would have loved to learn more about the scores, the musicians who played them and the composer who created them.Overall, this movie is one of those incredibly rare gems that are flawless.

I think that took a worn-out tape from a rental store, left in the trunk of a car for a month, and then made the transfer. It looks terrible. It only cost a few bucks, so I expected it to be poor, but I'd love for some reputable people to release it -- I'd buy it again.",N/A
36244,"John Carpenters In the Mouth of Madness is one of those few horror movies that really gets under your skin, it is not your average horror movie.The plot is about a free-lance insurance investigator John Trent(Neill) that gets hired by a publisher(look for Charlton Heston as the mannager), to find their best selling horror author Sutter Cane(Prochnow) that mysteriously disapeared. To aid him the publisher sends his yuppie-editor along with Trent.They end up in Canes fictional town of Hobbs End, and from there the plot really starts to pick up speed.Alot of the plot is loosely based on H.P. Lovecrafts Ctulhu mythos and borrows alot from Lovecrafts books and mythology without being a true mythos-story. When you are done watching the movie you really sit back with a feeling of &quot;What really happened?&quot;, because nothing seems to be certain in this movie.That said, I will say that this is one of the strongest horror movies of all times and one of the few that really mannages to scare without being (unintentionaly) funny.",N/A

Slowly and subtly, Levinson shows how their once close families are pulled apart by the demands of the culture.  From the flight of the middle class to the suburbs and the loss of traditional business values, the transformations our society underwent in the post-war period are captured here with masterful storytelling.  Watch how television gradually becomes the center of the home, rather than the family table.  The turkey scene, as funny as it is, is profound.  The extended family is falling apart, as the geographical distance afforded by the automobile grows.The acting is tremendous.

506576,"A previous reviewer raised an interesting question. He asked &quot;It is really hard to see why De Mille has such a relatively poor reputation, when one sees a film like Male and Female.&quot;This is not really a hard question to answer, but one must understand De Mille and the nature of his politics. De Mille has a poor reputation for many of the same reasons that Elia Kazan was treated so poorly at the Oscars a few years ago by so many in Hollywood and the same reasons why Robert Taylor's name was removed from a building on the old MGM lot.De Mille was anti-unionist, anti-communist, conservative, Republican; profoundly religious the other things that tend to destroy one's reputation in Hollywood.  In the 1940's De Mille was forced out of the host position of Lux Radio Theatre because he refused to join the union of AFRA, (now Aftra).What is often forgotten about De Mille is that he was, along with Samuel Goldfish, and Jesse L. Lasky, one of the founders of Paramount and in the early days of that studio, he was the creative force. He not only directed and produced many of the company's films, but also was in control of the company's entire output, writing scripts and directing sequences in films assigned to other directors. De Mille is often credited as the first man to film (the 1914 Squaw Man) in Hollywood. He did more than any other man to make Hollywood the greatest film center of the World. He handled every genre in film and even invented some that never existed before.In the mid 20's, De Mille sold his shares in Paramount and joined MGM briefly where he made some of his worst films such as the eccentric Madame Satan.De Mille doesn't deserve the poor reputation that he has. He was a cut above most of his competitors in narrative skills, pacing of action, in gauging public tastes and anticipating the changing moods of the nation. He developed some of Hollywood's brightest and most famous stars. He was a master storyteller and his films almost always entertained. But in Hollywood, as the truely blacklisted Kazan, Adolph Menjou and William Dmytryk found, your reputation is often judged on your politics and not by your product.",Male and Female

26287,"Blu Ray Review:First thing out of the way: what version of ""Brazil"" is this?  For those not aware of the complicated history, there are over 5 different versions of ""Brazil"".1: The original unreleased cut.2: The dreaded ""Love Conquers All"" studio cut.3: The US theatrical cut.4: The European cut.5: The Final Director's Cut released on DVD by the Criterion Collection.The Blu Ray version of ""Brazil"" is #4, the US theatrical cut.  I am very happy about this because that version of the film was never released on DVD, and my VHS of it was about to disintegrate.  The US theatrical cut is actually my favorite edit of the movie.  While I appreciate the Final Director's Cut, I don't like a few of the edit choices made in that version of the film.  Version #4 comes across as a dark comedy; while Version #5 comes across as almost entirely bleak, with a few light moments.The transfer:  The Blu Ray looks absolutely amazing.  I have never seen this movie looking so clean and crisp.  I am not as pleased with the audio transfer.  It seems like the balance is off when going from live voice to ADR, or in scenes with a lot of music or sound effects mixed with dialog.  That said, only really picky audiophiles like myself will notice the difference.Special features: There are none.  I assume this is in anticipation of the Final Director's Cut some time in the future.  This is minor shame in that Terry Gilliam commentaries tend to be very candid and entertaining.Final note for those who have never seen the film:  It's funny that after all these years, Universal still does not understand this movie (for more on that, read about the history of ""Brazil"").  For the film description, the first line the movie company put in their synopsis on the back of the disc is ""In a future world..."".  The entire point of the movie is that, as it says in the first 10 seconds, the film takes place ""Somewhere in the 20th Century"".  Just as much as when it was released, this is very much a film of the present (even though we're now in the 21st Century).  Simplifying it to the most basic of summaries, the plot is about a man who lives in an over-bureaucratic world, and he escapes the regiment and paperwork by retreating in to his fantasies.  The plot is so much more complicated than that, but ""Brazil"" is best understood by watching; and most rewarding by watching several times.Previous Criterion Collection Review:Brazil is a masterpiece.  I've seen the movie at least 50 times, and I still find new meaning in it each time.  I believe it (along with Fight Club) is the greatest movies ever made.It's hard to say what Brazil is.  On the surface, the movie is a commentary on how the bureaucracy and technology in modern society isolates people from each other.  It's about how things that are supposed to make our lives easier are actually end up making our lives harder.  Once you dig deeper, the movie means so much more than that.One thing I'd like to make clear, and it's important for viewing the film.  It takes place in the present...actually the past, not the future.  It even says at the beginning of the film ""Somewhere in the 20th Century"".  The reason the film may look ""futuristic"" is because the movie is a visual satire.  A cartoon on modern life.  Everything you see in the film, intentional or not (as you find out when you listen to TG's commentary), does mean something.As far as the DVD, the Terry's commentary is great, quality is perfect, and the bonus DVD about trying to get Brazil made is informative.  The ""Happy Ending"" Brazil is sick.  The only minor drawback is that the film suffers from the usual directors cut problem.  They add about 15 minutes to the movie in some spots...and take away 1 minute in other spots.  It's always odd to see when the directors choose to do that.Brazil is a piece of art.  It's like watching a painting unfold before you.  Watch this film several times and enjoy.",N/A

21623,"That was the dilemma for those who were dealing with the real-life Joan of Arc, and it remains so in reel life in &quot;The Messenger&quot;.I had got some free passes for this movie; my friend John was glad to come with me and my sister because he knew something about it. I guess what he knew was that IT WOULD BE VIOLENT, which is often a powerful motivator for menfolk. Well, okay, so it was violent--what of it? I think the essential value of this movie is that after you see it, you have a fairly accurate idea of how medieval warfare was conducted, how men had to rev themselves up for terrifying hand-to-hand combat with a truly mortal enemy. This is not a women's picture, no.Some things annoyed me about this picture. In the early pillaging scene, we see Joan is a little preteen girl. I thought, hey that's great, for once Joan is going to be a GIRL, you know, not a woman. But then we cut to the Dauphin/John Malkovich's castle where everyone's talking about the imminent visit from this strange visionary. She arrives, throws back her hood, and .... she's some other actress now! I really hate that kind of thing. This is a crucial scene; I have to trust my protagonist, and I don't even know this dame! She was also doing a lot of weird, border-line things that made you question her sanity. I don't think the real Joan comported herself like that--no one would have followed her into battle otherwise.Another problem was that a famous part of the Joan story is that she hears three saints' voices talking to her; they're the ones who inspire her to fight against England's invasion. But this Joan meets up with Christ himself, and later, with Dustin Hoffman.Lowdown on &quot;The Messenger&quot;: if you like authentic-feeling fighting, then rent it for that.

But after watching this, I had to admit that this was the most unexpected and pleasant surprise of the year.  This flick was action-packed, sexy and FUNNY!!!!  Cameron Diaz, Lucy Liu, and Drew Barrymore show a lot of on-screen chemistry and fun in the title roles, while Bill Murray is his usual droll self as their aide, Bosley.  Like the old TV show, they still take orders from the unseen Charlie (reprised by John Forsyth), but this time, they add tongue-in-cheek humor and &quot;Matrix&quot; style action to the slight plot.  McG, in his first film, directs this flick with a sharp eye and a knack for keeping things at breakneck speed.  Crispen Glover, Kelly Lynch and Tim Curry are fun as some of the foes that our heroines must face.  Nobody on the screen takes this stuff seriously, and neither should you.

44173,"THE CHANGELING(Canada - 1979)Aspect ratio: 1.85:1Theatrical soundtrack: Dolby StereoWith its highbrow aspirations and classy production values, Peter Medak's elegant ghost story ranks alongside the likes of THE DEVIL AND DANIEL WEBSTER (1941) and PORTRAIT OF JENNIE (1948) as one of the most accomplished ghost stories ever filmed. It opened theatrically in 1980 amid a glut of low budget shockers which dominated US theaters at the time, and was quickly lost in the shuffle. But good movies never die, they simply bide their time, and THE CHANGELING is now widely recognized as a bona fide classic by fans and novices alike.The late and much-lamented George C. Scott plays a classical composer who is recovering from the death of his wife and daughter in a terrible accident. Having taken a teaching job in Seattle, he rents a brooding old mansion where he hopes to rediscover the meaning in his life, but his plans are interrupted by a restless spirit which makes its presence felt and reveals the details of a horrific crime which took place at the turn of the 20th century in an attic room at the top of the house, a crime which implicates a powerful local politician (Melvyn Douglas) whose career was constructed on the foundations of murder...Like the mansion itself, THE CHANGELING is a grand and stately affair which forsakes outlandish displays of supernatural horror in favor of quiet, creepy details (a door creaking open of its own accord in broad daylight; a cluttered attic room festooned with cobwebs where a child's wheelchair stands in perpetual attendance, etc.), until Scott is fored to summon a medium after being repeatedly woken every morning by an unearthly pounding which echoes throughout the entire house (the explanation for which is both credible and deeply unsettling). While the seance itself is a memorably eerie sequence, it's actually surpassed by the scene directly afterward in which Scott listens to an audio recording of the entire episode. Here, the Dolby Stereo soundtrack transforms a simple, chilling idea into one of the most hair-raising set-pieces you'll ever see. Sound actually plays a vital role in the film's seductive charm, and sensitive viewers are advised that the film is genuinely frightening in places, especially viewed late at night in a darkened room with the Dolby processor cranked up to the max! You have been warned...John Coquillon's restless camerawork transforms the ornate mansion into a character all its own, and the autumnal Seattle landscape provides scant relief from the sense of impending horror generated by Medak's accumulation of details. Performances are top-drawer, including Trish Van Devere (Scott's real-life wife) as the real estate agent who becomes mixed-up in the murder inquiry, John Colicos as a cop who thinks Scott's investigation of the crime amounts to little more than an assault on Douglas' integrity, and Ruth Springford as an elderly patron of the local historical society whose sullen attitude towards Scott's mansion conceals a darker truth and provides the first clue to its tragic history. Jean Marsh cameos as Scott's ill-fated wife.Incredibly, scriptwriters William Gray and Diana Maddox were unable to match this film's artistic success in their subsequent screen work, and while Maddox' only other movie credit appears to be THE AMATEUR (1982), Gray co-wrote scripts for routine offerings like THE PHILADELPHIA EXPERIMENT (1984) and BLACK MOON RISING (1985) before becoming a producer on the unsuccessful primetime revival of ""Dark Shadows"" (1990), amongst several other TV and movie titles. Hungarian-born director Medak, who began his career with a number of critically acclaimed black comedies like NEGATIVES (1968) and THE RULING CLASS (1972), later distinguished himself with the intense true-crime dramas THE KRAYS (1990) and LET HIM HAVE IT (1991), before losing his way on the Hollywood treadmill.",The Changeling

376738,"After the unfairly bashed & hilariously satirical ""Mission to Mars"" (a satire almost everyone who saw the film seemed to miss) and the incredible virtuosity of ""Snake Eyes"" I will never underrate De Palma again as long as I live. The guy's a cinematic genius who hasn't lost his powers, just an understanding audience. And yet his peak years remain between ""Phantom of the Paradise"" & ""Scarface."" And the peak of that peak period is ""Blow Out,""  De Palma's most fully realized & poetically resonating elaboration of his favorite theme: the glossed-over & willfully ignored post-Orwellian horrors of modern America & the hypocrisies & power struggles & conspiracies that constantly churn its engine; the immense tragedy of this for its innocent victims & romantic heroes.  In ""Snake Eyes"" you had Cage & Gugino; the updated versions of Travolta & Allen in ""Blow Out.""""Blow-Out"" keeps you fascinated & riveted through its thriller elements while implying numerous things on the way until the last 6 or 7 minutes and then bursts out on multiple levels of metaphor with one of the greatest, most poetic endings in cinematic history which brings everything full-circle from the beginning and ties all the loose ends up in one magnificent fell swoop. The many levels and essences of corruption in American society, the constant rape of the innocent and naive by the cynical and powerful, the exploitation constantly going on represented by the cheap film company Travolta works for using a real scream of a girl about to die to finally get it right, etc., not to mention the ever-relevant post-Chappaquidick-at-the-time, post-Clinton-Lewinsky-Condit-now comments on political corruption, political conspiracies and cover-ups, the Antonioni-Blow-Up-like foray into the nature of reality and experience and cinematic illusion itself, all of this comes together in the final two scenes with a cathartic, understated bang! And, of course, the key to all this is John Travolta's amazing, subtle performance, maybe his best ever, and Nancy Allen's equally effective one as the ultimate poster-girl for youth, vigor and innocence, confused, unwittingly corrupted by the dark side of America, always two steps away from being saved and two steps away from being too far gone. John Lithgow also must be mentioned, since he plays such amazingly realistic villians, so much like a regular guy, almost everyone's suburban neighbor, and yet because of this very fact so evil it's positively creepy! Also, Dennis Franz of NYPD Blue makes a memorable appearance as a low-rent sleaze-bag manipulator whose very weaknesses as an aspiring sleazebag make him harder to hate, making you understand why Allen would trust him! Excellent turn by Frantz. De Palma's films of this period also use an intentional, slightly artifical style of acting, not quite 'over-the-top' but just twisted enough to suggest a level of self-parody. In ""Blow Out,"" Travolta's character is the only one played mostly straight, with everyone else seeming almost surreal, hallucinations of themselves.The DVD has an perfectly matted, not-pristine-but-relatively-decent-looking-to-my-eyes (although some DVD review places have complained about the color separation, I only noticed a slight swarming of black backgrounds during the night-scenes, and they still gave the transfer a C grade, not an F like the Scarface DVD) wide-screen transfer and the super-cool original trailer but not much more if 'extras' like a commentary are what you're looking for. It also has one of the cheesiest looking Main-Menu screens ever designed, but fortunately this is not reflective of the fair quality of the transfer itself offered in the DVD, just the result of some page-designer's nightmare. Oh yeah, the DVD also has a 'standard' full-screen version, on the other side, in case you're one of those geniuses who like watching your movies with only half the original motion picture on the screen, thinking you're getting more bang for your buck because your entire TV screen is filled!

351408,"If it takes a well-made film to remind us of the neglected jewels in our culture's literary showcase, then let it be a work that does honor not only its source, but also its own medium.  &quot;The Age of Innocence&quot; is such a film.The luxury of a novel is that it can be experienced in stages -- picked up and put down as time permits.  A motion picture must capture us, enrapture us and return us to earth in time for the next meal.  Thus, many of the subtleties of character that the novel has time to explore must, in the film, be inferred.  Scenes that are free to languish interminably within the novel must often be omitted within the motion picture for the sake of economy.  Their lessons elided must be ignored or transmitted in another fashion.  The limitation that time places on the film has led some to perceive it as innately inferior to the novel.  With this kind of defective logic we might conclude that the sonnet is an inferior literary form.  It cannot be of worth without physical length and breadth.  Hogwash!  The length and breadth of any artform are measured in the breadth and depth of thought the work provokes.  Or, as Raymond Chandler once wrote: &quot;There are no viable and significant forms of art.  There is only art, and precious little of that.&quot;The challenge of the motion picture, when trying to translate the novel into a cinematic experience, is to stay true to the souls of the characters in the book.  By doing so, whatever is lost in in the process of distillation, truth remains.  Martin Scorsese proves himself full worthy of Edith Wharton's vision and in so doing, proves her worthy of his vision as well.Exquisite! -- and at last on DVD!  Get the DVD!  Perfect casting, with Daniel Day-Lewis as Newland Archer, a New York socialite in the late 1800s torn between the social demands to marry for position and the inner burning for the love of a kindred spirit.  Michelle Pfeiffer is the Countess Olenska, a refugee from a scandalous marriage whose imperviousness to and freedom from the demands and disdains of the social class kindles Newland's passion.Winona Ryder is absolutely radiant as Newland's fiance, May Welland.  She is the winning image of everything that is style and grace but has no ability to perceive the dimensions of Archer's inner world -- his artistic world.  It is to Miss Ryder's credit that she plays her character as totally oblivious to her own intellectual vacuity.  She is in every other aspect of her character and personality, a person to die for.  A thousand other actors and directors would have allowed her single flaw to have negatively colored their entire rendering.  Yet it is her otherwise flawless character that sustains the tension as Newland Archer must decide between these two beautiful women, with each plausible choice bearing its own compromise with imperfection.Thank you, Mister Scorsese!  You have honored yourself and us.  From the lush production design by Dante Ferretti to the cinematography by Michael Ballhaus to the bridge narration of Joanne Woodward, there is not a false note here.  For those who feel that two hours and eighteen minutes is &quot;too long&quot; to sit still, let me refer you to the movie &quot;Amadeus,&quot; where the king is convinced that Mozart's work is too complex -- full of &quot;too many notes.&quot;  Mozart smugly acquiesces to the king, agreeing to take out the offending notes if only told which must go.  &quot;The Age of Innocence&quot; is the perfect length -- just enough notes to tell the story and still remain true to the art of the film.  If someone wishes less, I would refer them to the Cliff's Notes.",N/A

He is helped along the way by his veteran partner and a surfer chick.My Opinion:  What does 5 stars mean to me? Basically it comes down to did I enjoy it and how much. If I enjoyed it a lot and had fun or was completely moved then it's 5 stars to me. Now there are going to be a lot of different 5 star movies. Point Break is a fun lighthearted 5 stars compared to a movie like To Kill a Mockingbird which is a classic 5 star movie that deals with some heavy issues. With that out of the way, Point Break is a lot of fun.DVD Quality: Widescreen anamorphic - 2.35:1, Dolby Digital and DTS Sound. Trailers and more.What You Should Do:  You know you want it.

322806,"Francis Coppola's trilogy finally makes its appearance on DVD, an it was worth the wait.  Of course III is fatally weakened by the bizarre casting of Sofia Coppola, but the first two films more than compensate, indeed this is one series where the sequel even tops the original Godfather film.All the performances are excellent: Brando is humane and commanding (although the padded cheeks add nothing to his character), Pacino makes his traversal from gangster ingenue to mob boss more than convincing, and de Niro is superb as the young Vito Corleone.  Also do not forget the excellent Robert Duvall and James Caan in the first film.The DVD transfers are first rate.  In Godfather I there is very occasionally a hint of sky grain in some scenes, but for the most part the image is rock solid, with no grain or edge enhancement, showing off the peerless photography of Gordon Willis.Beam up chapter 12 in The Godfather where Michael returns to Sicily to check out how good this transfer is.  Colours are natural and vivid, and there are only a handful of tiny flecks or nicks throughout the films, so the prints are in nigh on pristine condition.The sound is also superb: the organ pedal notes during the famous christening sequence are stunning in their depth.This set is worth every penny of its asking price, and has not dated, although it also shows how fine a TV series The Sopranos is, matching these films in terms of script, performances and direction.",N/A

If your looking for more than the average, lame-brained teenage slasher film or exploitation blood bath, go here.  This is a savage satiric attack on American consumerism that is even more meaningful today than it was in 1979.  Likeable characters and and intelligent, well-plotted script, this film mixes in just the right doses of humor, action, horror and tragedy, placing it heads and tails above nearly anything you will find on the shelves today.  The Star Wars of horror films!  The only reason this DVD received 4 stars and not 5 is because of the lame job Anchor Bay did with it.  Yes, it's in widescreen and the image transfer looks pretty good.  Ok, but those things should be standard by now.  Everyone who is a fan of this film already knows that there are a lot more scenes that were featured in the European release that quite easily could have been included here as extras.  Instead, we get two!  There is no director's commentary, and if ANY film should have one, it's Dawn of the Dead!  Last but certainly not least is the terrible sound reproduction.  Why haven't they remasted this soundtrack into Dolby Digital 5.1 or DTS??  The score is fantastic and deserved much better.  If anyone from Anchor Bay is reading this, PLEASE release a better version of this!!!  By the way, AVOID at all costs the &quot;alternate soundtrack&quot; version of this movie.  It takes out all the great weird elements of the soundtrack in favor of a more contemporary &quot;mellower&quot; souding score, leaving in it's place a weaker, paler version of the film.",Dawn of the Dead VHS

660829,"A movie like this is all about the senses. Sight, sound, smell and especially taste. Chocolat is used as a metaphor for everyone's guilty pleasures. At first, everyone in the village appears to have a normal, happy life. But we soon discover that things are not always what they appear to be. The happiness is just a cover-up for what greater problems lie underneath. Chocolat comes into the village and uncovers the real problems with the inhabitants. Some of the subtlties in the movie aren't so subtle. All the townspeople wearing plain, muted colored clothing. Then Vianne and her daughter enter the village wearing bright red cloaks. Vianne is always wearing a red-colored outfit, marking her as different from the townspeople as possible. And her opening up a chocolatier during Lent and tempting the otherwise steadfast followers of the mayor and priest only exagerates the tension between them. The actors give good performances but the best is by Alfred Molina as the mayor. His wife has left him but he refuses to admit to it. So instead he attempts to control everyone else in town. But Vianne enters and threatens his control. He fears losing them as he did his wife. In the end we are to embrace one another for what we have to offer and not what lack. It's a basic moral to the story, told simply enough that even younger children could understand what the movie is trying to say.",N/A

Revenge of the Ninja stands well on its own and is actually better than Enter. The fight chorography is stupendous and really made the film more enjoyable. The fights are even better than Enter; must be due to Kusugi staging the choreography himself. Kung Fu fans enjoy! For more B-Action move enjoyment, see the next entry Ninja III: The Domination.

I don't know what kind of audience the director is aiming at or what he's trying to prove, but man, whatever he wanted to do he must have done it well because this is also one of the most entertaining things on celluoid I've seen as well.  Clocking in at about 70 minutes, this movie doesn't waste it's time with nuisances like color, diagloge, or even a plot.  Here's what I picked up at least I think this is what's happening.  There's this crazy nut and he puts a screw through his leg or something and decides to talk a walk.  (Best time to take a walk is right after you stab yourself in the leg)  So he walks around and gets run over by another guy.  The guy who killed him doesn't do much, apparently this is acceptable in Japan.  But he probably wishes that he didn't do that now, because he now has...a metal whisker.  I kid you not, his ironic payback is A METAL WHISKER! WHY?  But on a more important note, what do you do when you have a metal whisker? Pull on it, of course.  That wasn't a good thing cause now he's squirting blood all over the place.  When will those nutty japs ever learn? This doesn't effect him too much, he doesn't even care when some lady on a subway turns into a metallic zombie for no apparent reason and trys to get with him. No, the tale isn't over yet, next thing he knows his wang is replaced by a giant rotating screw.  Naturally, this pleases his wife and she wants to test it out immediately.  Big mistake, cause know she's squirting blood all over the place.  Them japs, them crazy, crazy japs.  But blood isn't enough, she also needs to turn into cottage cheese and form into that crazy metal zombie.  OOOOKAY!

By &quot;those&quot;, of course, i mean films that are consistently funny throughout. And Grail is one of the most startingly original comedies of all time. It's hard to imagine that it was produced by a comedy group that merely a year before had put together a woefully unfunny final series of Monty Python's Flying Circus.What makes Holy Grail so deliriously funny is the absolute anarchy of it all, the wide range of jokes, running and self contained. It has off the wall moments of nonsense that surely must have been dreamt up by the clinically insane. The Knights who say &quot;Ni&quot;, the killer rabbit, the bridge of death, none have lost their power to split the sides of the viewer. Best are John Cleese's Black Knight and Michael Palin's repressed peasant: &quot;Come and see the violence inherent in the system! Help! Help! I'm being repressed!&quot;Yes, it's extremely silly. But what makes Grail, and the later Monty Python's Life of Brian, stand the test of time more so than the TV series and the film Monty Python's Meaning of Life is that the jokes are so accessible. They are not obscure or pretentious, they are just plain funny.What stops this from being a master piece is an all over the place narrative and a very, very disappointing ending, but these are small quibbles. The storyline may be flimsy, but the jokes that are hung on it are of a high calibre. The closest you can come to pure, unadulterated comedy.",Monty Python and the Holy Grail

First is Tony Kaye, you have done a breathtaking directing job in turning what potentially could've been a replay of all the racist movies over the past years into a film that I will never forget. Whenever something comes up on the news about Nazis, skinheads, African-American fights etc I'll remember this film. Second person and probably the person who deserves it most is Edward Norton. Edward, your performance has changed my life. I have never seen a male give what is such an effortlessly amazing and truly masterpiece of a performance. Were you really acting, Ed, or was Tony Kaye just following you around for a few years? Kudos also to script-writers, Edward Furlong, other supporting characters and good cinematography and design which flips from black-and-white to colour cleverly. This movie is totally violent, has a lot of coarse language and is extremely graphic about all its subjects. This is what they should really be teaching kids in school, all about what really happens in America. I don't live in America myself but I thought it gave a very apt description of skinheads who live there. Totally amazing stuff, American History X earns a place on my top 10 films of all time, making it not only the best movie of 1998 but the third best of the decade, following American Beauty (it is obviously good to have American as the first word for your film title - all the movies that start with the country are fantastic - American Beauty, this film, American Pie, American Psycho, so on and so on) and The Shawshank Redemption.

Two main complaints:  first, the dialogue was on the nose.  Every character yelled about how awful their lives were and how much they hated each other.  Second, Anderson repeated characters and scenes so literally that they weren't thematic, they were redundant.  Two old men dying of cancer who lament the fact they cheated on their wives?

On the surface, it appears to be simply an action/adventure flick with SF elements. However, a deeper inspection reveals unexpected depth. The movie, in it's way, is actually quite profound, and begs of you (like the book it is based on) the allmighty question: what is reality? Speaking of the book, I have heard a lot of people complain that this is a bad adaptation of it, Philip K. Dick's masterpiece Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep? And, true enough, it leaves out some things from the book and changes others, but this is to be expected for any adaptation. One shouldn't expect a book's purely literary qualities to come across on the silver screen; rather, it is nice instead to see the particular qualities that movies can deliver better-i.e., visuals, cinematography, atmospherics, etc.-focused on instead. And Blade Runner does that to the utmost. It highlights the points of the book that could be made better by movie treatment, and still retains much of it's heft.

Granted, the makeup is quite realistic (though the special effects seemed a trifle silly) but overall, the acting, the plot.. the whole story was overblown.I had expected much more, and came away glad that I had just rented the movie.Watch if you must, watch if you want to see what changes have been made in comparison to the original Planet of the Apes, but: don't expect very much.",N/A

569062,"It was in 1920 that Hercule Poirot's egg-shaped head first appeared in print. He was a Belgian refugee living in a small English town near a manor house named Styles, at which there was a mysterious affair. Told from the point of view of Hastings, a recent participant in the Great War, the story tells of a poisoning through a cup of coffee that was never drunk, a cup of cocoa that contained no poison, and several possible wills. This and the usual &quot;crowded murder scene&quot; all add up to a superior murder mystery called &lt;The Mysterious Affair at Styles&gt;.As soon as I finished viewing the DVD version released by Acorn Media, I reread the novel and marveled at how closely the script adheres to the original. Even the dialogue is, for the most part, drawn from the pages of the novel and the casting of the film seems just right, especially the despicable Mr. Inglethorpe (Michael Cronin). One prominent character in the book is gone from the film; and my rereading showed how dispensable he was originally.As always, a few comic touches are added to the film, such as Poirot's trying to Anglicize a group of fellow &quot;Belgies&quot; who are more interested in the local pub than in British marching songs. Also, while Poirot's lust for neatness will be a running joke throughout his many novels and short stories, here it actually leads to the solution. Of course, there is that old routine of the Watson character (Hastings, played as always by the excellent Hugh Fraser) making a chance comment that provides the &quot;missing link&quot; needed to close the case; but we can forgive that clich&eacute; in an old mystery where it would be laughed out of court in a modern one. Also Hastings is given some depth by showing his nightmares of trench warfare--just possibly to contrast the ado caused by a single death in a tiny village as thousands were being slaughtered in continental Europe. (Or am I reading too much into it?)David Suchet has the character of Poirot as part of himself , while Philip Jackson has little enough to do as Japp of Scotland Yard and does it very well. The young women are reasonably attractive and do not look like the fashion models who would be cast in many American productions. The rest of the cast ranges from very very good to excellent, all helped enormously by the World War I ambiance of soldiers lounging on wonderful stone bridges and doctors who make house calls.A Must addition to your collection of  Poirot and Wimsey productions available from Acorn Media, not to mention the Jane Marple and Avengers sets put out by A&amp;E.",N/A

It is a hilarious film that will have you laughing so hard your throat will hurt.  It isn't that it doesn't have problems, there is a cute little oil scene, that has a flaw, but the movie is so funny you can look past it, because it wasn't that big of a deal.  It isn't as funny as Dogma, but Dogma was a twisted film with witty writing, great cast and some wickedly;y good ideas.  Still Big Mommas house is so funny that you can't help but laugh at it really hard, some good deep down belly laughs are what we all need.

274236,"An involving contemplation of the human condition, ""Aguirre, Wrath of God,"" directed by Werner Herzog, is a pensive meditation on the nature of the species, an emotionally engrossing film that is visually stunning (it was filmed on location in the Amazon), insightful and imaginatively presented.  The story begins in 1560, with Pizarro (Alejandro Repulles) and his army of conquistadors traversing the Andes in search of wealth, as in the wake of the conquest of the Incas some years before, the Indians began circulating stories of the legendary City of El Dorado, which purportedly held riches beyond measure.  When they reach an impasse, however, Pizarro commands forty men to continue on down the river by raft, to seek out any Christian civilization that may be of help or able to lead them to their destination.  He places Don Pedro de Ursua (Ruy Guerra) in charge, with Don Lope de Aguirre (Klaus Kinski) as his second in command, giving them one week, after which time if they have not returned, Pizarro and the rest will go back the way they came.  Among the forty chosen to go on, are Ursua's wife, Inez (Helena Rojo), and Aguirre's fifteen-year-old daughter, Flores (Cecilia Rivera).  But when this leg of the expedition goes awry as well, Ursua issues orders that they are to return to Pizarro; Aguirre takes exception to this, however, and rallies the men against Ursua, telling them to consider Cortes, who disobeyed when ordered back, and then went on to conquer Mexico.  What the men do not realize at the time, is that Aguirre is a delusional madman with an agenda of his own, that actually has little to do with the acquisition of wealth, but everything to do with what he perceives to be his destiny as the ""Wrath of God.""Herzog has crafted an absolutely mesmerizing film that is innovative and transporting.  He permeates the story with a hypnotic, ethereal atmosphere that draws you into this world, and allows you to experience the hardships of the river and the nearly insurmountable obstacles of the Peruvian Rain Forests and the mountains.  He creates that sense of being in a dream, where nothing is real, all of which is enhanced by the deliberate pace Herzog sets, as well as the haunting score that intensifies Aguirre's descent into madness.  There are a number of truly memorable scenes, the most brilliant of which frame the story:  The opening takes you along with Pizarro and his men as they negotiate the treacherous mountain paths, plodding slowly through mud and mist against all odds.  It's an extended scene that allows the viewer to assimilate the full import of what is transpiring, and with it, Herzog is letting you know what to expect from the rest of the film.  It's a breathtaking beginning, rivaled only by the final scene, in which the camera endlessly circles Aguirre as he stands alone on a raft in the middle of the river, expounding his delusions of claiming lands and the conquests that lie ahead still, surrounded by scampering monkeys and an aura of doom.Kinski, with his natural, haunted expression and the chilling depth of his eyes, is perfectly cast as Aguirre.  He captures the very essence of a man whose soul is damned, yet remains adamant in his quest to fulfill what he deems to be his own destiny.  Cloaked in armor, his long hair straggling out from beneath his helmet, he exhibits a singular countenance, infused with menace and an attitude of invincibility.  It's a powerful performance that underscores the impact of the contrast between the strength of his misguided and paranoid character, and the folly of his actions.  That he is unbalanced is obvious fairly early on in the film, and because of that, coupled with his determination, you are quickly able to discern the probable outcome of the story.  And it's disturbing, watching and knowing the fate that awaits these people with whom you've become involved, while at the same time, you're somewhat numbed to it all by the wistful state of being into which you have been so subtly lulled by Herzog along the way.The supporting cast includes Edward Roland (Okello), Dan Ades (Perucho), Del Negro (Brother Carvajal), Armando Polanah (Armando) and Peter Berling (Don Fernando).  An honest consideration of instinctual behavior, ""Aguirre, Wrath of God,"" is a thought provoking study of the innate predisposition of man to go forth and conquer, regardless of-- or perhaps owing to-- his present situation, whatever or wherever it may be.  It's a rare film that will take you to a place wherein reality is seemingly an illusion reflected in madness, profoundly borne on the artistic wings of Werner Herzog.","Aguirre, the Wrath of God VHS"
444104,"I notice some reviews below that refer to buying the Elite Entertainment DVD of Night Of The Living Dead. They're absolutely right! Their 5 star rating they're giving is not for THIS DVD! I don't want to see people confusing this DVD for Elite's DVD and making the mistake of buying this one. You will be cheated into getting a worthless piece of garbage that George Romero had absolutely NO involvement with. It's just an excuse to give the filmakers an ego trip and get their families involved in something they missed the first time around. That, and greed, pure and simple.If you really must see this edition (if only for comparing it to the original) RENT it. You might get a laugh out of the 15 minutes worth of new footage of actors you don't really care about, apart from the cemetery zombie, looking 30 years older and 30 pounds heavier, which doesn't do anything to add to the story. But mostly what you'll get is disgusted, especially with how much of the original movie they remove. The new &quot;score&quot; by Scott Vladimir Lucina doesn't hold a candle to the library music which was used in the original version. There is also an audio commentary with the filmakers applauding their efforts and saying how seamless the new footage is incorporated into the movie. This is far from the truth and they know it, judging from the joking around and the frequent gaps of silence.The &quot;98&quot; edition is equally appalling. It's the original edit of NOTLD, but also the new &quot;score&quot; is here in all its' glory. If Anchor Bay would've used the library score on another track there would be less disatisfied viewers (well, I would be, for one). And, contrary to the reviewer below me, there is NO, repeat NO deleted scenes added to this version. In fact, it runs about 50 seconds shorter than Elite Entertainment's version. Go figure.Oh yeah, the DVD suppliments. A useless theatrical trailer, a behind the scenes featurette that's more boring than your neighbor's home video (which essentially this is), an appalling clip from Flesh Eater, an annoying Dance Of The Dead video that is unintentionally hilarious, and a still gallery accompanied by Lucina's music. Whoop-de-dooo. There is also a &quot;32-page, 4-color collector's booklet&quot; about the making of this edition but precious little about making the original.The one positive thing I can say is that the video quality is very good, but no more than Elite Entertainment's DVD which is hands down the one to buy. Anchor Bay's is the one to burn.Please note that I didn't mention Scott Vladimir Lucina's acting ability.",N/A

Everybody knew that these films wouldn't be hits, they were little presents offered to the successful actor.

Starring Sondra Locke, Geoffrey Lewis Scatman Crothers, Sam Bottoms and Clint, the movie has all the ingredients of a good comedy. Witty and heartful. The show presented by Clint and his friends is hilarious and the relations between Bronco and the children very well developed.

484173,"""Reindeer Games"" has a Lot going for it, two Flavour of the Year Stars, a Flavour of the Month Screenwriter (Erin Kruger), a Talented Veteran Director (John Frankenhiemer) and the fact that there is Nothing out recently that is Anything Like it (""Best Laid Plans"" would come closest, but did it all Better). It is a Small, Different Crime Thriller, lacking in the Thrills and Effects that Pepper Modern Thrillers, but Full of Old Fashioned Characters given Modern Quirks. The Characters would feel more at home in a 1940's Film Noir. I won't review the Plot as it's Best to let it unfold before your Own Eyes, the More you don't know, the Better.At it's Best point's, ""Reindeer Games"" manages the Difficult task of being Refreshingly Old fashioned and Slickly Original at the Same Time, at it's Worst points, it is Slow, Boring and a Little Frustrating as it Seems to be Losing it's way. Genre Master Frankenhiemer (""Ronin"" and ""The Manchurian Candidate"") Never allows that to happen, but his Usually strong Leash has been Loosened a little.While I was Disappointed by it's lack of Action and Thrills, I Very Much Enjoyed it's Strange Sense of Humour that Never Seems Intentional. It All comes from Character and there are a Few Points where the film reaches Laugh Out Loud status, which I Never saw Coming (eg. The Motel Bill bit, the references to ""Little Drummer Boy"" and the Pow-Wow Safe bit). The Dialogue is also a High point, while the script may Lag and Drift here and there, the Dialogue never does. There is No Denying that Kruger isn't a Talented Writer, and while he gives us just enough to stay Interested in his Young Career, he needs to Show us more of his ""Arlington Road"" Originality. ""Reindeer Games"" has a Bit of that films Originality, it also shares it Realism, and both films are Well Grounded in Reality. The Biggest difference between the films is their Endings, while One has one of the Best Endings Ever Witnessed; the Other has one of the Worst, see below for Details.The Usually Strong cast are in Good (but not Great) form, their Characters let them down and they have to cop the Brunt of Audience Hatred. It's the Fault of Kruger's Screenplay that has it's characters Moods Swing as often as a Gun is Drawn. It is hard to care for a character that you just don't Understand, if their Behaviour and Moods are so Irrational, you simply Can't get Attached. Ben Afflict is Likeable here, Annoying there as Rudy, our would be Hero. His Performance is good, but you won't be Biting your nails about weather he'll Live or Die. Charlize Theron has Scarcely given a performance that I haven't Loved, this performance is among he Worst, she starts out Great, but Falls Apart as the film Progresses, which was Quite a Shock as I've Never thought that I would like to see Less of her. Gary Sinese is the films Saving Grace when it comes to Performances. He seems to want to Make Up for his Lousy Bad Guy Performance in ""Snake Eyes"" (or maybe his lousy Good Guy Performance in ""Mission to Mars""). Even though he is the Villain of the piece, I cared about him the Most and I even found myself Willing him to Win the day.""Reindeer Games"" also features a Much Talked about ending (much talked about in the Negative sense). It's not so much an ""Average Thriller"" ending; it's more a ""Below Average Horror"" ending. Being that Erin Kruger also wrote ""Scream 3"" I'm not really surprised, but then again he wrote ""Arlington Road""... Now I'm Outraged. For Many, this ending will Make or Break the film for you, while I saw it coming and wasn't very Phased by it, I fear it will cause More Breakings than it will Makings.",Reindeer Games VHS

479566,"Apart from simply implying that the film is the story of Alvin Straight, the title, ""The Straight Story"" is also a colloquial reference to Lynch's crystal clear vision. That, appropriately is where all irony ends. The Straight Story is not a film of metaphors or symbols, although the journey of a stubborn man across 370 miles to see his ailing brother, his encounter with a wide variety of folk has been construed as some sort of fable. Lynch, always one to expose the rot the lies beneath the picket fences, has a filmography that would encourage such an interpretation. The story here, from all angles is that of a man and his mower, and ofcourse everything in his long life that has led to this momentous journey.Richard Farnsworth was nominated for best actor in a leading role, and lost. Perhaps that was appropriate. There is a certain falsehood in the word ""performance"". He wears the sorrow and the joy of some 70 odd years on his face. Unlike many movies about or featuring elders, the film doesn't presume him to be some ubiquitous fountain of wisdom. He is honest, and whatever wisdom he has was hard earned. The worst thing about being old he tells a somewhat hyper cyclist he meets on the road is ""remembering when you were young"". Maybe a better accolade for Farnsworth is people's inability to describe how he is in the film. An expression, that seems to emulate from whatever soul human beings have, is worn on his face. It says, and affects, more then is feasible to describe.There was I recall surprise at the kindness of this film. Not just to Straight, but to the strangers he meets on the journey. They are, surprisingly for Lynch, not only sane, but ones I would be glad to run into if I just happened to be travelling on lawnmower. Lynch's fans would recognize that, although seemingly the opposite of the likes of Blue Velvet and Wild at Heart, The Straight Story comes from the same place, the same wordless search for the truth, whether in ugliness, beauty or kindness. In one scene that will be remembered for a very long time: Straight sits with a stranger. They discuss drinking, and from there, the war. There is no music, just brief sounds of battle, but no visuals. Both men experience an unexpected outpour that can only come adventitiously. He remembers those young boys back in the field ""I dream of their faces. Sometimes, it's not even my buddies, sometimes its German boys. We were shooting moon-face boys at the end of the war. Every year I live is a year more then they've had"". Quietly, this scene dwarfs Spielberg's entire Saving Private Ryan, and Lynch.... I was going to say does it, but rather, he lets it happen with the melancholy in an old man's eyes.Search if you must but you won't find another film quite like this one. The closest I can think of is Wim Wender's Paris, Texas, another seemingly unaffected film. The elements of The Straight Story are indeed superlative. Angelo Badalementi's score, particularly the twangy violin, soft acoustic guitar of Laurens Walking, is cleansing, mournful, understated. Freddie Francis's photography is breathtaking, but somehow, never overpowers the film. I would call it a masterpiece. But what Lynch and his collaborators have accomplished is a form of cinematic purity that transcends such pedestrian praise. It gains an added measure of poignancy when you consider that Farnsworth took his own life last year in the face of terminal cancer. In the film, a stranger offers to give him a ride to his brother's place. He smiles, thankful and says ""I am gonna finish this one my own way"". I could never tell exactly why, but his final gaze up at the stars is one of the great moments in cinema.",The Straight Story VHS
6982,"When I read the reviews of this movie, all the critics said that this movie worth the great STURGES's, CUKOR's or LUBITSCH's classics. It is certainly not. The plot is common, the dialogues often poor, and I didn't understand why Julia's character wants Mulroney's one so much (Mulroney is totally uninteresting). The only good scenes are when the excellent Rupert EVERETT appears (and I think the actor gave a lot of himself in his 3 scenes). I found Julia ROBERTS exaspirating in some scenes (she thinks that she only had to speak loud, fall several times from her chair or smoking a lot of cigarettes to be considered as the new Katharine Hepburn or the new Carole LOMBARD - the genial and zany stars of &quot;Bringing up baby&quot; and &quot;My man Godfrey&quot;). I know it is my OWN point of view, but I don't think Julia ROBERTS (and Meg RYAN and Sandra BULLOCK...) is a good screwball actress (in the Colbert/Lombard/Hepburn/Dunne way). When she tries to be like those stars of the Golden age of American comedies, she is totally artificial an &quot;forces&quot; her effects (big mouth...) -just see overrated romentic comedies like &quot;Notting Hill&quot;, &quot;The runaway bride&quot;, &quot;The mexican&quot;, etc, and compare them to a Preston STURGES's classic- On the other hand, in a &quot;serious&quot; movie like &quot;ERIN BROCKOVITCH&quot;, she is totally just and sensitive, and she deserves her reputation. To go back to &quot;My best friend...&quot;, it is worth watching for the Rupert EVERETT's scenes. I feel the director P.J.

581024,"First, let me say that I consider Jack Nicholson to be one of most underrated actors of his generation. His performance in &quot;The Pledge&quot; is nothing short of remarkable, not so much in the way his speaks the dialogue, but in those moments when he has none, and reveals the mind of a deeply tormented man. Other reviews have discussed the plot, so I'll dispense with that, other than to say that this is a movie about redemption and a lost cause. The pledge referred to in the title is one that Nicholson cannot assuredly keep, and thus forfeits his &quot;soul's salvation&quot;. The Nicholson character is basically a lonely, desperate man, who hangs his hopes on catching a serial killer, and by a twist of fate, fails in his mission. The supporting cast is excellent, Benecio Del Toro, Robin Wright Penn and even Vanessa Redgrave (one of the best performances in the film, although a brief one-scene cameo). Sean Penn's direction is superb, with the intercutting of nature scenes with the main plot (watch for the symbolic flock of birds throughout the film). This is not a film for those who desire neat, tied-up endings but ones which mirror the real and unresolved tragedies of life.

522541,"I always try very hard not to compare movies to books that they might be based on. I always feel that a film should sink or swim on its own, so to speak. They should be judged as an independent piece of art, because in actuality, that's what they are. After all, every piece of art is going to be based on some experience by the artist. So what if the work is based on another piece of art. That said, the moment that the credits rolled in this film, I felt that I had no choice but to read the book.That's actually meant to be a compliment. A lot of people will say about a movie &quot;you should read the book.&quot; And by that, they mean, &quot;the book is better.&quot; That's not why I wanted to read the book. I was so moved by the film that I wanted an opportunity to totally immerse myself in the world in which it took place. I ordered the book from Amazon the next morning and have only just begun to read it. I can only hope that it will move me as well as the film did. Given the depth of the talents of its Pulitzer Prize winning author, Michael Chabon, I don't expect that I will be disappointed. I will likely write a review of it as well, but I wanted an opportunity to review the film as a piece unto itself first without hampering my opinions based additional knowledge from the book.What really struck me was how real the film was. At least from my point of view. I felt as though I knew those people. I felt as though I lived that life. Part of that may be due to the fact that I did live that life (I graduated with an English degree from Carnegie Mellon University, where this movie was filmed), but I think a lot of it was also due to honesty with which these characters were portrayed. From Katie Holmes's Hannah, the mysterious cute girl in the class with an obvious crush on the professor to the Michael Douglas's Grady, mildly successful, more of a writer than a teacher with a fine eye for detail that will zone in on a single aspect to sum up the entire character and personality of a real life individual (like her feet).This film is beautiful. I mean it simply breathtaking. I was enrolled at CMU for six and a half years. As I said before, I have been to each location seen in that film more times than I can count, but I can honestly say that I saw the campus in an entirely new light and I will never be able to look at it the same way again. The scenery makes this picture. I've lived in Pittsburgh for nearly a decade, but whenever anyone asks me where I am from, I have always told them Cleveland (my original hometown). But after seeing what the film crew did here, I am proud to live in Pittsburgh. A little bit of movie magic has turned this burned out steel city into a thing of beauty. And I mean movie magic. The movie was actually filmed during an uncharacteristically warm winter. Almost all the snow in the film is fake. It was astounding to see the crew pumping fake snow out all over the place during filming, but it comes across wonderfully realistic in the film.I recommend this film to anyone and everyone. I watch a lot of movies, and I can usually find something nice to say about almost all of them. But it is very seldom that I see a film that touches me in the same way that this one did (the most recent before this was American Beauty). I especially recommend this film to anyone who is familiar with Pittsburgh; the creative writing process or who has at some point found themselves at a difficult crossroads in life. In short, I recommend the movie to anyone like me. But the thing is, I recommend this movie to anyone who isn't like me. Go see this film. You'll be glad you did. And if by any chance you are anything like me, then perhaps you will find a bit of yourself in this film. Perhaps you will find out that you're a Wonder Boy as well.",N/A
382948,"One of Woody Allen's most underrated outings, &quot;Radio Days&quot; is a tremendously funny film which depicts the grip that radio had on America during World War II. While void of an actual plot, &quot;Radio Days&quot; succeeds as a series of vignettes involving a loud, comical New York family whose lives are enlightened by an array of music, sporting events and soap operas which reach their home by way of static-filled airwaves. Long before TV and the Internet, radio was the only source of popular culture in many American homes. Family members who fought constantly (And boy do they fight in &quot;Radio Days&quot;!), always found time to bond around the big radio cabinet in the kitchen or living room. In typical Allen fashion, the dialogue and characters are delightfully over the top. The cast -- Michael Tucker, Julie Kavener, Seth Green, Mia Farrow -- are stellar and perfectly suited for the outrageous script. The real charm of the film is Allen's witty take on War-era radio shows. Everything from Superheroes to a radio ventriloquist (think about it...) are spoofed in way that only Woody can spoof. Of course, classic songs from the 1940's gloriously re-reate the romance and charm of a bygone era. While &quot;Radio Days&quot; may not be as &quot;important&quot; as &quot;Annie Hall&quot; or &quot;Manhattan&quot;, it is a wonderfully entertaining film which bares all the trademarks of a Woody Allen classic.",N/A
178854,"I remember renting &quot;Legend&quot; years ago and thinking, &quot;Hey this movie is missing bits.&quot; And so it was.  The version I had seen on cable was the Brit version, not the American Theatrical release.  So here it was, I had access to a not quite perfect version of a movie I cherished.  But now, on DVD, I can have it all baby!  This is a Ridley Scott masterpiece (widely and enthusiastically panned by every critic) that I would put up against any fantasy movie ever made.  It's romantic, menacing, and fantastic.  Also, it has infiltrated everything I have ever drawn or painted since I was eight years old.  I know you all are as expectant as I am, this is going to be great.",N/A
518914,"If it weren't for the fact that The Matrix was also released in 1999, I would have no problem saying that this was the best film of that year.  At this point, I feel that these two films must share that honor, as both were ground breaking on multiple levels.Fight Club is primarily a pitch black comedy, as someone mentions on one of the four commentary tracks included in the DVD.  Some people will understand the comedy and enjoy it.  Others, like my wife, will not.  This is the only movie that I've asked  her to watch that she would not finish.  About half way thru, she said she was done and walked out.  This film is a wild roller coaster ride, and as with the real thing, it will thrill and excite some, while just making others sick.The level of detail in Fight Club is remarkable.  Finding all the subliminal Tyler's is just the begining.  For example, Ricky (the kid who couldn't remember if he had ordered pens with blue ink or black), is in the scene where &quot;Jack&quot; is leaving his office for the last time, with blood all over his face, and a shopping cart filled with computer equipment, being escorted by security.  Ricky recognizes &quot;Jack&quot; and just has this wonderful smile appear on his face that looks like a combination of surprise, delight, and respect.  This happens in the edge of the frame for a second or less.  David Fincher was definately thinking about the DVD crowd when he put this masterpiece together.What can I say about the 2-DVD set that hasn't already been said?  It is spectacular.  The extras are fantastic, not just a bunch of lame schetches (although it includes these too for those who enjoy them).  There are numerous deleted scenes, and all of the behind the scenes stuff is actual video footage, not stills.Just for completeness, this movie is not about fighting.  It is about being so numbed by the blandness and meaninglessness of life in the 90's that the only thing that can get your attention is having the living crap kicked out of you.  It's about how easily some people are led.  It's about trying to find your place in a world that doesn't make sense.  It's about coping with your father walking out on you when you were 6 years old.  And of course, it's about how stress can result in a fractured personality.As for the violence in the file, it's not the kind of violence that you are probably used to.  For example, only one person dies in this film.  Compare that to &quot;The Terminator&quot;, or any number of other films where lots of people die.  I think there are two key aspects to the violence in this film that disturb people.  First, the depection of a couple of the beatings is pretty graphic, and the makeup work is very realistic.  Also, the sound effects of the punches are superbly realistic.  Second, other people are shown during a couple of beatings, and they are clearly very disturbed by what they are witnessing.  It is normal human psychology to take emotional cues from others, and the emotional cues coming from the other actors make it clear that you are supposed to be very disturbed by the events that are transpiring.  So, while Fight Club isn't particularly violent in terms of how many people die, the violence that IS there is driven home with great force.",N/A

347350,"This Sherlock Holmes story is quite surprising. We know the criminal from nearly the very start, and the whole story is about how Sherlock Holmes will stop him. Of course there are a few surprises and we know that he will succeed. That is not the point. The film is interesting for a first reason : it shows Sherlock Holmes's method very well with planning, disguising, exploring, pressurizing, and a few other niceties and oddities. Just for this reason the film is entertaining. We will though criticize slightly the fact that Sherlock Holmes is often shouting a little bit too loud. The film is also interesting for a second reason : it reveals the hypocrisy of Victorian society. And there it is great. All those women and men from the good society, more or less from the nobility, all have their little secrets, especially letters they received or they wrote from or to their sweet hearts of their younger days. So it is nothing but affairs and sentimentalese capers in all possible directions : a man for a drag queen (yes it did exist in those days), a girl for a man who is  below  her standing, etc. This Victorian society was thus nothing but a big hypocritical bowl of vipers. It was quite courageous from Conan Doyle to dare touch such a subject, of course with no details what so ever. We know that details would have been deadly for the author : Oscar Wilde ended up in prison for ... everyone knows what, and  Lady Chatterley  by D.H. Lawrence was banned till the sixties of the twentieth centuries, which means it was only available in continental editions and on the continent, and everyone in England had it of course, or at least had read it. The film is thus a beautiful picture of this aging Victorian society. Dr Jacques COULARDEAU, Paris Universities II and IX.",N/A
552034,"I had fond memories of the film having seen it when it was was first broadcast by PBS in 1980.  It was a modestly produced ($250,000), ambitious (taking on a difficult to film science fiction novel), first ever P.B.S. produced movie.  It was supposed to be one of several PBS produced films, but legal problems tied to music rights de-railed the project and kept the film un-available for 20 years.  The way many people have seen it is on bootlegged black market videos.The movie very good, but it's poor special effects and flaws may make first-time viewers wonder what the big deal is all about.  The movie is a mostly successful attempt at making a worthy film out of great novel by Ursulla K. Le Guin.I enjoyed the film a great deal, but there is  some truly horrendously written dialogue, and some very unfortunate directorial choices.  The acting by Bruce Davison and Kevin Conway remains quite good.  Conway goes a bit over-the top and borders on campy melodramatics a few times, but not enough to de-rail the film.  Indeed the budget restraints of the film requires the type of energetic Pavlovian performance he gives.  Margaret Avery however never over-comes the fact the script has given her little to do and the directors aren't sure how to best utilize her.  In one scene her character is passionate but in the next she is almost apathetic.  The original story and its ideas are strong enough to withstand such flaws however.The film is Directed by Fred Barzyk and David R. Loxton and written by Roger E. Swaybill and Diane (creator of t.v.'s Murphy Brown !) English.You can see how this film might have incluenced films like Brazil, Bladerunner and The Matrix.The film's special effects are cheap and a few steps below the level of an old Star Trek episode.  This might be distracting to viewers. The film however isn't relying on it's effect but it's ideas and I hope new viewers can get past the dated cheesiness of the effects and enjoy what the film is about.I hope so.  The film ultimately overcomes its limitations and works very well as an above average example of an intelligent science fiction film.  There haven't been many of those.The film is about a well-meaning Icarus who pushes too hard and flies too close to the sun with disastrous results.George Orr ( portrayed by Bruce Davison, who at the time was most famous for Willard and Fortune in Men's Eyes and recently played the Senator in the X MEN film) is an everyman in a Portland, Oregon of the `near future'.  The world is over-populated and on the brink of economic disaster.  Weather patterns have been altered by the effects of nuclear war.  George Orr believes that when he dreams, he changes reality.  He tries to prevent himself from dreaming and has recently over-dosed on drugs. Under terms of his probation he must go and discuss his problems with Dr.  Haber an Oneilogist (who specializes in dreams).  At first, the doctor doesn't believe that George Orr can actually change reality with his dreams.  Only George you see remembers how things were before he dreamed.  He's lived with the guilt and horror of how his dreams change reality since he discovered his unique gift or curse when he was 17.  As viewers, we quickly believe George is telling the truth. His dreams do change reality.  Then Haber suggests to George that he change the weather patterns in his dream.  The Doctor runs up to roof of the building while George dreams and watches with amazement as the always cloudy skies, suddenly become blue and sunny. Most of the population think it's been sunny for several years, but George and the Doctor know that it was George's dream that changed things.  The doctor realizes that he can cure all of the world's problems by hypnotizing George and giving him suggestions about what he should dream.Like in the Monkey's Paw, however, one must be careful what is asked for or disaster could result.  George is well aware of the dangers of what the Doctor is doing, but the Doctor won't listen to him.  Will George be cured of his `effective dreams'?  Will the Doctor playing God destroy the world he is trying to save?  Will ever changing reality make it impossible for George to re-connect with the woman he has fallen in love with?While I was disappointed  the film did not age as well as I had hoped, it is still a worthwhile one which deserved to be saved from obscurity.  It has taken the efforts of several big name stars (Tom Hanks and Jason Alexander for example) and thousands of fans over the last several years to convince P.B.S. management to resolve the legal issues over the music right which have prevented the film from being re-broadcast. They were and the film was re-broadcast on P.B.S. in June of 2000 and recently released on video and DVD.  Included on the DVD is a wonderful interview of (Portland, Oregon based) author Ursula K. Le Guinn by Bill Moyer.While the rescue of Lathe of Heaven from obscurity is unfortunately not on the level of the restoration of a true masterpiece like Dreyer's The Passion of Joan of Arc, it is a very welcome return of a thought provoking and ambitious film that deserves to be widely seen.&quot; Those whom heaven helps we call the sons of heaven. They do not learn this by learning. They do not work it by working. They do not reason it by using reason.  To let understanding stop at what cannot be understood is high attainment.  Those who cannot do it will be destroyed on the lathe of heaven.&quot;As an amusing aside.  Ursula K. Le Guinn based the title of her novel on the above translation of an ancient Chinese quote.  However, it was a bad translation because at the time it was written there were no such things as lathes.  Still a great quote and a great title though.Chris Jarmick Author of The Glass Cocoon  with Serena F. Holder - A steamy cyber thriller available January 2001. Please order it today. Thank You",N/A
364976,"This is an action adventure that pays much homage to all the other action adventure films that came before it.  And there lies its problem.  This is a futuristic tale of a Marine officer sentenced to life in a maximum security prison (actually ending up on an island with warring &quot;tribes&quot; of convicts) for murdering his commander.  Of course you get the obligatory evil warden, along with the obligatory &quot;really-bad bad guys&quot; and the &quot;not-so-bad bad guys&quot; (straight out of the Mad Max ROAD WARRIOR movie).  Not to stop there, you also get the obligatory hero with a guilty conscience, along with a young man who is in awe of our hero, and we can't leave out the obligatory traitor in the midst.  I'd also be remiss for not mentioning the obligatory father figure who leads the &quot;not-so-bad guys&quot;, and of course there is always the tough, second in command, but gee whiz, who's counting.The really sad thing about all this is, the movie turned out to be pretty darn good in spite of itself.  Ray Liotta plays the exiled Captain, and his performance is very intense and believable.  Stewart Wilson plays Marek, the leader of the &quot;really-bad bad guys&quot; and has some of the best comic dialogue and one-liners in the film (ala Alan Rickman of DIE HARD fame).  Those two performances are memorable, but alas, it's just not enough to carry the film for its full length.  The actions scenes also vary.  Some are appropriately intense and done well enough, but some are just...well...obligatory.Between 1 and 10, I give &quot;No Escape&quot; a solid 5.  Had the script writers dared to be a little different, this could have been a very entertaining movie.  As it turned out, it was just okay.

30885,"Aimless 17 year old Eddie Adams is a high school dropout who works in a car wash by day and busses tables by night.  Life is uneventful until he catches the eye of top adult film producer Jack Horner (Burt Reynolds).  To Jack's delight Eddie is very well endowed, and thus Eddie becomes &quot;Dirk Diggler&quot;.  Film covers the adult film industry from 1977-1984, and Dirk is an overnight sensation.  He's welcomed into Horner's circle which is pretty much a motley bunch:  Amber (Julianne Moore), a mother figure who occasionally has a cocaine binge, Rollergirl (Heather Graham), a sex kitten who feels lost in life, Scotty (Phillip Seymour Hoffman), a gay sound man with a crush on Dirk, Reed (John P. Reilly), a fellow porn star, Little Bill (William H. Macy), a troubled production assistant, Buck (Don Cheadle), a frustrated actor who wants to start his own stereo shop, and the Colonel (Robert Ridgely) a sleazy older man who produces Jack Horner's films.  All are in a family type of relationship, so this reminds one of &quot;Goodfellas&quot;, only we have pornography instead of guns and murder.  As Dirk's success grows so does his head, and he changes from a genuinely likable kid into an irrational a**hole.  We really don't enjoy this change.  But this movie is powerful on so many levels that I don't have the room to list all of them.  One worth noting:  The film is an observant human portrait; and yet of so many characters.

Why?  It's not just the plot, which itself is funny-- no, it is the performances of the late great Zero Mostel as Max Bialystock (what a name!), Gene Wilder as Leo Bloom (whose name was derived from James Joyce's &quot;Ulysses&quot; whose stage version starred Zero Mostel), Kenneth Mars as &quot;Springtime For Hitler&quot; author Franz Liebkin, Christopher Hewitt (Mr. Belvedere himself!) as flamboyantly gay, and cross-dressing, Roger DeBris (another great name!), the late great Dick Shawn as &quot;L.S.D.&quot;, and so on...and the interaction between all of them is just hilarious!  Even all of the smaller roles get filled with with memorable characters.  (Like the &quot;CONCI-OIGE!&quot;)  For the most part, they just don't make comedies like this anymore.Now, they've just re-made &quot;The Producers&quot; for Broadway (as Franz Liebkin would say, &quot;Broadvay...oh, joy of joys!

554986,"The 3 stars on this review do not reflect on the quality of these movies.  House on Haunted Hill is far superior to the technically rich remake.  Last Man on Earth has Vincent Price in his best role, and one that Charlton Heston couldn't duplicate in the &quot;Omega Man&quot; remake.  If you can find either one of these movies on a different DVD, get them...Both of these movies, but especially Last Man on Earth deserve better care than the manufacturer gave them on this DVD.  Last Man on Earth is made from a umpteenth generation copy of the film that is so scratchy I was wondering in the beginning if I was watching someone's old 8 mm home movies.  House on Haunted Hill is somewhat better, but you'd think that the owners of these movies would try to redigitalize, and fix the scratches and other physical flaws of these movies.Furthermore, the soundtracks of these movies sound more that they were recorded through an old sock.  It's really unfortunate that a better effort was not made to preserve these movies so those in the future could appreciate their real value as movie fun, rather than look at them as old used, and worthless, relics.Since no attempt was made to upgrade the look and sound of these movies, I cannot recommend the purchase of them.  However, if you can find a copy that was redigitalized, the soundtrack remastered, and the images fixed, get them in a heartbeat, these are great movies.",House on Haunted Hill/The Last Man On Earth
186788,"An interesting take on infidelity. Rohmer's style is subtle and sparse, and his characters take first priority. The protagonist is a happily married man who still fantasizes about every pretty girl he sees while walking on the streets of Paris. A friend he hasn't seen for a while and wasn't particularly close to before, Chloe, drifts back into his life and thoughts, slowly but surely. Her affections for him seem to grow as they begin to spend generally platonic afternoons together, while at the same time his beautiful wife, who he truly adores, has their first child. The new father then continues his friendship with the young Chloe, and he ultimately must make the decision whether to cross that line with her.Although there are two women to the one man in this story, as in the other Rohmer films I've seen, this film is about the Man, and His Choice. The Male protagonist speaks to us in the voice over, it is His Story. His thoughts, His dreams, His fantasies, and His choice.One complaint, if it can be called that, is that the wife's character leaves less of a trace than Chloe. One would like to know why the protagonist makes the decision he must make in the end, and be able to compare the two women he shares his days with somehow. The main difference between his wife and Chloe seems to be that his wife is more submissive and less playful, almost melancholy in a way (but not necessarily unhappy). And fragile as a bird. As would be expected, she represents stability, continuity, home. Chloe on the other hand is a bohemian drifter type who appears and disappears just as easily. She represents, also as to be expected, freedom, spontaneity, possibility. But they are still, in some sense, fragments. Especially the wife. We do see her joy in motherhood and domesticity, but it's only in one dimension.Rohmer's films are like a giant puzzle with One Proper Couple being formed as all the pieces come together. He is fascinated with the beginning/early stages of relationships, and the choices that are made at that point. Serving as a sort of match-maker for his characters, he foresees one suitable mate for his Protagonist, and Only One. And though these films are watchable and interesting, sometimes he leaves the information/emotional landscape which underlie the Protagonist's decision undefined and shadowy. We are left then, in the end, to only guess as to the reasons of the Protagonist's depth of feeling, and how he can be sure that his decision is the Right one. These men don't look back.This one's in color (unlike the first few films in the Moral Tales series). The films in this series end somewhat abruptly, and as the FIN burns on the screen, you may find yourself with some questions. In this way, these films are good conversation-starters.",N/A

But it ranks right up there with &quot;Platoon&quot; and &quot;Go Tell the Spartans&quot; as among the very best of the Vietnam war films.It pulls few punches in its depiction of that war's brutality. It is totally stripped  of all sentimentality. Importantly, it sympathetically portrays both Vietcong and American humanity, feelings and attitudes at the infantry level.A plus to this film is R. Lee Ermey's (also see &quot;Full Metal Jacket&quot; and &quot;The Boys in Company C.&quot;) portrail of Marine Sgt Major Bill Haffner who, at the beginning of the film, is in command of a small recon squad. Later, upon &quot;relieving&quot; an inept dope-smoking Army captain of command, is ultimately in charge of shaping up an entire company of near misfit GI's at Firebase Gloria. He job is to fortify the base and defend it from an impending Vietcong attack. The ensuing battle sequences are as harrowingly realistic as any you'll see anywhere. Real life ex-marine Ermey is completely convincing, funny and entertaining even though, at times, he appears slightly uncomfortable in the lead role.Some viewers may take exception to Sgt Haffner's unprovoked beratement of Nurse Capt.

578957,"If you take X: THE MAN WITH X-RAY EYES literally, you probably won't like it. Scientific implausibility, a melodramatic plot, and histrionics from some minor players will turn off viewers who don't have the ability to see beyond the reflective surface of a movie script. However, if you're the kind of viewer who loves to ride through a film looking for hidden messages, director Roger Corman takes you on one hell of a trip.Disguised as a low-budget sci-fi thriller about a medical doctor who discovers the secret to x-ray vision and consequently spirals into madness, X: THE MAN WITH X-RAY EYES is really a social allegory with two possible interpretations. First, it is a comment on how an ethically and morally unfettered quest for knowledge can lead to personal and professional damnation. And secondly, it is a warning about how irresponsible drug use--even in the quest for knowledge or self-enlightenment--is ultimately self-destructive. (In the commentary that is provided as one of the bonus features on the DVD version, Corman reveals that his original concept for this film did not revolve around a medical doctor involved in risky research, but instead centered on a jazz musician who develops x-ray vision via the use of illicit drugs.)The acting in this film is quite adequate. Ray Milland turns in a very affecting performance as Dr. James Xavier, a medical researcher obsessed with learning how to chemically enhance the range of human vision (both optical vision and intellectual vision). At times his acting is reminiscent of Colin Clive's in 1931's FRANKENSTEIN--which is interesting since the main plot device in both movies is a medically and scientifically improbable procedure that ultimately becomes the springboard for social allegory--and he is able to evoke that same sort of pathos that makes the audience care about a character in spite of the character's culpability for his own fate. Diana Van der Vlis also does a nice job portraying Dr. Diane Fairfax, Xavier's associate and implied love interest, and caustic comedian Don Rickles gives an interesting, though at times histrionic, performance as a carnie. Some of the minor players aren't as strong, but in some ways this only adds to the sublime surrealism of the film.The special effects are, as in many Corman productions from the 1960s, obviously low-budget, but they serve their purpose adequately enough. Besides, flashy FX would only be an upstaging nuisance anyway, as the real star of this show is the allegorical subtext. Roger Corman is a legendary director because he knows how to overcome obstacles such as a lack of funds and still shoot an engaging picture. And the master doesn't let down his league of horror fans, either, delivering an ending that is both gruesomely shocking and a bit gory. (In the DVD's bonus commentary, Corman calls the ending &quot;low-budget Greek tragedy&quot;).Admittedly, parts of X: THE MAN WITH X-RAY EYES are dated. But these are limited mainly to incidental details such as clothing and hairstyles. If you want to watch a riveting horror movie that has been artfully and lovingly crafted, you usually can't go wrong with one of the classic Roger Corman flicks. And this film is a case in point.",N/A
403544,"By now, everybody knows that Halloween The Curse of Michael Myers was butchered by Dimension Films prior to release.  Several scenes were cut out of the film, others were shortened and the ending was entirely (and probaby for the best) reshot.  That's not to say that this theatrical cut ending is anything good...but acceptable and a little less silly than the original ending.This sixth entry in the Halloween series has its problems to be sure, but it's also pretty scary.  Picking up six years after Halloween 5, we meet up again with Jamie Lloyd who has just given birth to a child in the confines on the Thorn cult compound.  Jamie escapes with her baby and Michael follows.  From here on, Michael returns to Haddonfield, Dr. Loomis (the returning Donald Pleasence in his final performance) is in pursuit and the mystery of the man in black is finally revealed.  The problem with this theatrical cut is that it's largely incoherent.  Most of the plot seems to have been removed, several key character development scenes have been snipped and what remains, is basically, the stalk and slash carnage that Michael Myers wreaks on the family living in the Myers house.All of this may sound like carping, but far from it, this Halloween is actually one of the scariest (right behind 1 and 4), although it never quite matches up to those superior Halloween films, this one gives the viewer plenty of spooky scenes and some undeniable suspense.  Rising star Paul Rudd turns up in an early starring role as Tommy Doyle who Laurie Strode babysat for in the original film.  Tommy is now obsessed with Michael and knows that he has returned.  Rudd's Tommy is a great character, Paul Rudd brings a lot of charm and charisma to the role-he makes for a great screen presence, it's too bad the series wouldn't revisit this character, for he is much more interesting than the sniveling alcoholic Jamie Lee Curtis gave us in Halloween H20.Halloween The Curse of Michael Myers is widely debated amongst Halloween fans, while it's flawed to the extreme, to deny its impact is to be ignorant.  Director Joe Chappelle takes a lot of flak for this film, but he actually infuses a lot of style and suspense into the 88 minue running time.  The operating room massacre scene is a highlight among the Halloween series..not to mention the cool quick cut opening.  In an earlier cut of the film, Chappelle actually comes off as a much stronger director, we see lots of awesome homages to the orginal Halloween such as a scene of Michael stalking Kara as she walks home from school, and a scene of Dr. Loomis fighting with the local police.  Many nice touches were abandoned in favor of a shorter film...it really is a shame.In the hands of a more capable, competant studio, Halloween The Curse of Michael Myers may have had a better chance...the makings of a great sequel were definately there (track down the infamous H6 producers cut).  As it stands, turn your brain off, turn down the lights and be ready to be scared.  Michael has come back to Haddonfield to kill and Halloween will never be the same.",Halloween: Curse of Michael Myers VHS

185780,"When Jacques Demy created his souffle of a musical, his plan was to continue a story he had begun with his film LOLA, starring Anouk Aimee, and then continued in BAY OF ANGELS with Jeanne Moreau.  Characters from the first two films appear either by reference or in the flesh (Marc Michel, the young diamond merchant, was once in love with Lola and sings an aria over visuals of a shopping area used in LOLA) in UMBRELLAS, and the story was to have continued with THE YOUNG GIRLS OF ROCHFORT, having Guy go to Rochfort from Cherbourg to buy equipment for his gas station and, in true Hollywood musical fashion, run into twin sisters, one of whom is the double of Genvieve from UMBRELLAS (again played by Catherine Deneuve).  Unfortunately the actor (Nino Castelnuovo) who played Guy had committed to do a t.v. series and was unavailable, so Demy rewrote his concept, brought in one of his musical film heroes, Gene Kelly, ended his dream of being a filmic Balzac, and basically ended his trilogy with THE UMBRELLAS OF CHERBOURG.The marriage of music, color, visuals, faces, emotions, and finally war enabled Demy to present his most romantic picture to date with THE UMBRELLAS.Aside from two fairytale musicals (PEAU D'ANE and THE PIED PIPER [starring then-rock star Donovan]) that followed, his later films never achieved the joy, romance nor success of THE UMBRELLAS, although he did come to L.A. in 1968 and made a fourth chapter to the film history, going back to LOLA and having Anouk Aimee come to Los Angeles where she is getting by as a model in a photographic ""model shop"", hence the name of the film, MODEL SHOP....she shows pictures of characters from the earlier films, and if you've seen them all, this film should come full circle.  The young man obsessed with Lola was played by Gary Lockwood, right after his 2001:A Space Odyssey experience.  Demy wanted another young actor to play the role, but Columbia Studio bosses felt he wasn't anyone, had no real background and they wanted to draw people who knew Lockwood.  The young actor was Harrison Ford.  And Michel LeGrand didn't do the music.  Demy wanted the music to be very fresh and American, and so hired SPIRIT to work with him, when he couldn't convince Jimmy Morrison and the Doors to do it.  The film is a love letter to Los Angeles, but didn't come anywhere near the success of Demy's UMBRELLAS.In UMBRELLAS, the naivete of the teenaged (or just out of) Deneuve and the sweetness and naivete of the story lends itself to this bouquet of love lost, choices made and life lived.The music, of course, is the most recognizable of Michel Legrand's work, two of it's songs having received worldwide recognition.Curl up with your favorite cuddler, turn off your need to be totally realistic and drift away with young love, a palate worthy of the French Impressionists, and music to warm your heart.",N/A
88670,"I watched &quot;The Exorcist&quot; for the first time a few days ago. Until then everyone told me it was the scarriest movie they had ever seen.I'm a scaredy cat,so it took alot of guts to finally sit down and watch it. I'm glad I did,because it truly is a very scary but extrodinary movie. The movie is about a 11-year old girl named Regan who becomes possessed by a demon. There is one  scene in the movie called the &quot;spider walk&quot; you will have to see the movie to know what it is,but it is the best scene in the whole movie. The movie basically is about the fight between good and evil,but if you watch the movie you will find out that it is about so much more. I would not recommend this movie to someone who can't stand the sight of blood.This movie in my opinion is  gory. I would also not recommend this movie to anyone under the age of 18. For the rest of you who are searching for the ultimate horror movie,you can stop looking because you won't find one any scarier than &quot;The Exorcist&quot;.",N/A

Most prople were turned off of it because it was not The Sixth Sense, and I blame the advirdisments, such as: &quot;Unbreakable, from the writer/director of the Sixth Sense, starring the Actor from The Sixth Sense.&quot; The film takes a slow and cerebal approch to something that could of been silly, superheros walk the Earth. Unbreakable starts out with the birth of a child, who has several boken bones upon birth. Then in modern day we see a man on a train, then the train crashes (offscreen) and we see him in the hospital. The docters infrom him he is the only survivor. A man now, the child born at the beggining has a strange condition that makes his bones break very easily. He thinks that comic book superheroes are real, and that David Dunn (Bruce Willis) is one of them. He has never had an illness and never been injured. Skeptical at first, David slowly realizes that Elijah (Sam Jackson) may be right.",Unbreakable
169993,"Holly Golightly was in the 60's what Holly would be in the year 2000. A dreamer, a tad shy, a woman on a quest and deep inside a tad scared. I pulled the book off my bookshelf Tuesday as I was in a thoughtful mood and needed to ready something short but with depth that would remind me what life is all about.And after I read the book I watched the movie and was also reminded what class is all about, in watching Audrey Hepburn. She was much like Holly and there are some excellent books via Amazon on her as well that I recommend. But for Breakfast At Tiffany, I give thanks to Truman for this priceless gift.When you read the book even if you have seen the movie, you can still visualize using todays standards etc her standing at Tiffanys eating breakfast (fast food), and having the quaint apartment in NYC and scampering down the fire escape to visit her male neighbor. In fact it is easier to visulaize now then in the 60's when the book and movie were daring, because while most people may have had affairs (sex outside marriage) it was not something so in the open as it is today. In fact the book is fun because when you read it, you compare then and now and realize how much things have changed yet also stayed the same.I also cry at the scene where the cat she loved put out on the street in the rain. I wonder if people realize that this was an act of such pain and angst. She loved that cat so much yet, it was herself she saw being put out in the rain, all alone, scared and not sure what was going to happen next.",N/A
70186,"Whether you liked him or hated him, those were your only choices. And that's exactly how Andy wanted it.One of the most original and influential entertainers of our time, Andy Kaufman, believe it or not is still best remembered as Latka of Taxi-fame...to the layman. Although Taxi gave him popularity nationwide, what many people DIDN'T or still DON'T know is that Andy was SO much more. A Behavioral scientist first, infamous put-on artist a close second, Andy didn't tell jokes...he lived them. His antics were so intense, if it wasn't for Bob Zmuda (Andy's writer &amp; best friend) the cat may have still been in the bag. Though Andy died in 1984 of lung cancer, many fans, friends, &amp; family thought he was pulling the ultimate prank. But in all reality, it was the most serious objective of his life. Before Andy's lifestory came to theaters, Zmuda released &quot;Andy Kaufman Revealed&quot;, the book that blew the whistle. Every hoax, every prank, every Kaufmanism, all of it...finally exposed. Though I didn't find the book before I went to the movie, I was already well informed. I was already a fan. Two years before I had even heard news of an Andy movie, I had seen my share of Kaufman TV specials (strongly recommended to take similar steps). Which made my MAN ON THE MOON experience all the better (this translates for all movies, do your homework before you go).  Throughout the film I was in complete awe. Jim Carrey, who portrays Kaufman, shows why he is the $20 mil-a-film actor. Honestly his best work to date. I was in such awe that I actually forgot Jim Carrey was in the film. Maybe because I didn't see Carrey at all, but instead saw Kaufman reborn. A smart move by the movie's bigwigs to hire Carrey, a well known Andy fanatic. Tally up another mark for Carrey under &quot;All-Time Greatest Oscar Snubs&quot; (though he did win a Best Actor/Comedy Golden Globe, even though the movie's a drama..?!). After the movie, my father, my best friend (both big Andy fans), and I were utterly speechless. I'll agree with some people who say that movie may not have shown who Andy really was, but that can only be the fault of the producers. This film could have easily been 3 hours or more, cause what they did show is really only the tip of the iceberg when it comes to Andy's career. Also, after I read the book, I realized how much it was missing and how similar the movie's contents were to that of the TV specials I had watched. That's allright though, it made me realize how well Carrey grasped the concept of the double role. Double? Did I mention his dead-on portrayal of lounge singer Tony Clifton, Andy's badguy persona? Actually, it isn't even a double role, for Carrey does many more of Andy's famous characters including an Elvis impersonation. Amazing is all I can muster up. With all that said, this is still a must own for fans of Andy and Jim alike, and especially for the never-believers. As for the DVD, in which I own and was compelled by to purchase a DVD player since at the time I couldn't buy MAN ON THE MOON on VHS, the only thing it's missing is a commentary feature. I would have loved to have heard Jim, Danny DeVito and most of all, Bob Zmuda's take/reaction on Jim's transformation and the overall product. Other features such as Deleted Scenes (you can actually see reasoning in it), two R.E.M. videos (Title song &amp; the Great Beyond), Cast &amp; Crew files (VERY well done/detailed) do fit the bill quite nicely. But personally, my favorites are the Spotlight on Location (The making of MOTM in which it shows Carrey still in character(s) on set) and &quot;Andy Kaufman: This Is HIS Story&quot; which is not only a good read to help fill you in on Andy, but also contains about 10 minutes or so of the Real McCoy in live performances (which you can access by clicking the Andy icon by the This Is HIS Story text when available).  One last suggestion for the Andy newbies. I strongly recommend watching the film before reading the book, for it may ruin some surprises for you or possibly make the movie a disappointment (favorite antics and subjects of importance you thought should have been included). Last but not least, &quot;Dank you veddy much&quot; (you knew it was coming!) for reading.",Man on the Moon VHS

33177,"This was an excellent action/vampire movie.  The storyline was well written and their seemed to be no problem in putting the storyline on the big screen.  It is not your classic vampire flick and if that is what you are looking for this Blade is not for you.  On the other hand I think you will enjoy this movie.One thing that I found real cool that some of the vampire legends were not true in this movie.  For example, crosses no longer warded off vampires.  Also vampires often made allies of mortals.  This was one aspect I liked about the movie. Another thing I found very enjoyable was that Blade is exhibited to be a ruthless and cold blooded killer when it came to dealing with evil vampires. Yet on the other hand when it came to his friends and allies he was almost the exact opposite.  Snipes, and the creators of this movie did a very good job with displaying these two contradicting personalities in Blade's character.  I see some people commenting that Blade should have tried to save his vampire mother.  However, Blade realized that she was a vampire and that she posed a serious threat.  Because of this, he knew that he needed to take her out, which he did.The fighting scenes were spectacular and for the most part Blade was beating the living crap out of any vampire who dared step in his path, and his skilled use of all his tools and gadjects were very appealing to watch.  However in the last scence blade got beat up pretty bad but he got his revenge later.  In addition to the fight scenes the special effects were done very well, nothing really spectacular, but that is certainly better then over doing it.  one scene that stands out in my mind is the scene were all of the vampires' blood joins and its begining to fall onto Frost's head.  This seems to be a very simple scene but the closeup of the single drop of blood was very pleasing and at the same time erie to watch.  Snipes acting was pretty good, but I think that the best acting in this movie goes to Stephen Dorf his character of Frost was VERY convincing and he himself was probally the scariest part of the movie.There is also an alternate ending which I am VERY glad did not end up in the final cut of the movie.  The final scene in the alternate ending shows Frost actually changing into the blood god  and it was very corny and terribly done.  I am glad they decided to cut that part and im sure you will be glad too.If there was one bad thing about this movie, there were 2 or 3 cheesy one liners that could have been left about the movie.  But, I guess it did add a bit of comic relief.All in all Blade is a very well written and well done movie.  Non-critical veiwers and will enjoy this movie for what it is and will not try to compare Blade's character to other &quot;nicer&quot; superheroes.",N/A

Each as their own story of human endurance and what got them into each situation, such as the swordfishing boat who all of its members have someone waiting for them when they get home, to which they have to make a decision, waiting out a storm and not going through it, or going through the storm with their huge payload and making a fortune on it.

These superb actors draw you into their relationship so convincingly that you feel you're witnessing a real life drama instead of a movie. Eugene's love for Dominick is handled with dignity and sensitivity, as he constantly tries to balance his brother's needs with his own. There are so many nuances and revelations in this story that I fear that I can spoil it if I reveal too much of it. Suffice it to say, the purpose of my review is to whet the appetite of the reader without spoiling their dinner. This movie has a lot to say and does so brillantly. Both Hulce and Liotta should have been oscar winners for their performances in this film. Tom Hulce has to be one of the most underrated actors; his performance in &quot;Amadeus&quot; was also brilliant. In that film, he and F.

321486,"It's very well known that writer/creator Joss Whedon's original script for this film was horribly butchered and changed around from his original idea. This mixed bag film is the disappointing result. Not to say the film is bad. It's not. It has a cute, campy, cult appeal to it. Kristy Swanson stars as stuck up Beverly Hills brat Buffy who learns she is a vampire slayer by a mysterious man named Merrick(Donald Sutherland). She changes into a completely different person as this becomes her new life. The film goes more for comedy than the horror/comedy/action that Joss' original script had. Studio execs should always listen to the brilliant Mr. Whedon. Swanson does a job though. She has the L.A. snob part down cold. Paul Reubens as a vampire lackey is, as usual, the best part. Rutger Hauer as the head vampire was given way less to do and comes out as a really uninvolving character. Some of the jokes work well though. I laughed a few times. Don't expect that to happen during the whole film. Buffy, the T.V. show, was really Joss' vision. The brilliance and intelligence of that special show makes you wonder what this film would've been like if Joss had gotten his way. We'll never know. Check this film out for the camp value. If anything else, tune into the wonderful T.V. show. Sarah Michelle Gellar has nothing to worry about against Kristy Swanson. She's cute and everything, but nowhere near the depth of Ms. Gellar.",N/A
228399,"Arnold Schwarzenegger has one of his best roles as Dutch, the leader of an elite rescue force which is called upon to rescue a cabinet minister of a friendly Latin American government who has fallen into rebel hands.  Coming along for the ride is Dillon, played by Carl Weathers, who used to work with Dutch in years past but now is a CIA agent.  What Dutch does not realize is that the story he has been fed by Dillon is baloney.Predator plays like two movies in one.  The first third of the film focuses on Dutch's team trying to rescue the &quot;cabinet minister&quot; held in an armed camp deep in the Central American jungle.  The movie then changes gears when the Predator starts hunting Dutch's team.What helps make Predator better than other films of this genre is a really good cast that complements Schwarzenegger, including Jesse Ventura as the tobacco chewing Blaine, Bill Duke as Mac (notice how he is always shaving himself even though he does not have any facial hair!), Sonny Landham as Billy, the Indian Tracker, and the beautiful Elpidia Carillo as Anna. Each character has a well defined personality that makes each one stand out.The Predator is &quot;one ugly....&quot; as Dutch calls him, and it can best be described as tall creature with a crab-like face and rasta dreadlocks.There are some minor plot flaws, for example, why did the Predator wipe out Jim Hopper's team before it could attack the rebel camp, but then waits until after Dutch's team has wiped out the camp before he hunts them?  I also thought the scene when they were all firing into the jungle to be a bit excessive, but Predator is still a classic for me.",N/A

After having purchased the DVD and having watched this wondrous movie several times, I've come to the conclusion that this movie is a true EPIC, in the purest sense of the word.  This is a tale of parallel love stories.  Michelle Yeoh and Chow Yun Fat's love is tragically romantic.  Eastern cultural laws force their passion to remain unfulfilled.  This subplot really did break my heart.  Just when it appeared they may ignore tradition, tragedy strikes in the third act of the movie.  The Young couple's love is heft with potential yet unfulfilled due to one's greater love to fulfill her destiny as the &quot;Hidden Dragon&quot;.  A mix of confuscius, Aesop and &quot;Love Story&quot; told through Ang Lee's remarkable cinematography and near flaw-less fight sequence direction.Oh and lest I forget...the action sequences are amazing.  The two female leads have the most incredible swort fight shot in a &quot;MORTAL KOMBAT&quot; videogame camera-angle.  The fight-sequence execution by the stars are superior to any movie I've seen.The DVD has the standard features of a premium DVD: featurette on the making of, commentary, and some other tid-bits.  Not as remarkable as THE MATRIX for features, but more than acceptable.I recommend this movie to EVERYONE.

What a waste of resources. Stephen Dorff is probably the only remotely appealing part of this film. The best part, though, was a quote from Snipes (probably attempting to be so wise and witty), ""Some m----- f----- always has to try to ice skate uphill.""

521424,"All right, admittedly, this isn't &quot;The Usual Suspects.&quot;  It is, however, a well-done adaptation of a comic with a frightening backstory, both in terms of complication (I'm certain every single X-Man has died at least once, and if they haven't it's coming) and, well, stupidity.I should say where I come from; I hate the comic.  Love comics, hate X-Men.  It's not a comic book, it's a lifestyle, a monstrously twisted and convoluted backstory that REALLY needs to be cleaned away (DC Comics has the right idea, doing some huge event that purges various problems and contradictions.)  As such, boiling it down, let alone rendering it watchable, would have been hard work.  Yet this is a perfectly accessible movie; you don't have to know ANY backstory to enjoy it.Bryan Singer at the helm definitely helps, but the cast is also mostly sharp.  I wish Halle Berry hadn't done so many Quaaludes before every scene, but she's the only bad apple in the bunch.

Sadly, this film does not use her nearly as well, and because of her charm the plotline makes no sense: Ben Foster is a high-schooler who has just been dumped by his longtime girlfriend and in his misery avoids Kirsten Dunst and her obvious attraction to him!!! Oh that I were in high school again. Martin Short gives a funny performance as the school&#65533;s obsessed drama teacher who has decided to put on a modern musicalization of A Midsummer Night&#65533;s Dream (from whose plotline this film liberally borrows).

Humor doesn't play a big part this time, but that's OK, because were more interested in finding out more about Sidney's unknown life, or at least, her mother's.

364975,"ESCAPE FROM ABSOLOM is a classic sci-fi movie from New Zealand director Martin Campbell, the man behind GoldenEye and The Mask of Zorro, ESCAPE FROM ABSOLOM is truly a classic movie starring Ray Liotta, Lance Hendrikson and Ernie Hundson (Ghostbusters fame) who all do exellent performances. Liotta does good acting in a scene of the movie when his character is haunted by the memories of him killing people as he watches the fire. This sci-fi film set in 2022, in a future where prison corporations have become big buiness, A convicted soldier (Liotta) is taken to a Jungle island after being banished from a maximum security prison ruled by actor Michael Lerner. Only to find the Jungle island is ruled by two societies of prisoners, Savage outcasts and peaceful criminals. Where he discovers escape is impossible, and he plots to escape. The film is set on location in Austrilia, the film has good film-sets, good costume designs and good special effects.

567608,"I looked forward to this release for a long time, having just missed out on getting the &quot;Bay of Blood&quot; version and being interested in seeing the film that inspired so many rip-offs in the early 80s (especially Friday the 13th - shot for shot in one sequence). I sat down with some expectations, but not too many and what I got was a very boring, killer film with a few excellent setpieces.The film kicked off brilliantly and the first ten minutes were quite something, but then the plot kicked in and the film bogs down and then bogs down some more as we are introduced to a variety of cardboard characters that youn couldn't give a ---- about. It was interesting to see Bond Girl Claudine Auger 7 years on from &quot;Thunderball&quot; though.Being Bava, this has some great sequences (opening titles, the deaths, and an awesome scene involving a nude girl, swimming and some fishing line), the music too is really moody yet cruisy, and the killer is not your usual mad-slasher variety. However, the audio on the DVD is AWFUL!! Characters sound like they're whispering and you turn the volume up, only to have them start shouting and almost shatter your living room windows. The print isn't bad (Not great though), and it has some good extras like an Acid Drenched 70s trailer etc, and best of all a death menu (where you can access all the deaths in the film at a push of a button), but really you can save your money and go and buy a better film than this.

The movie is less an anti-war statement than a rather banal testimonial of US war efforts, complete with sentimental speeches and a hackneyed, feel-good ending.  The movie does show the usual Spielberg technical prowess that is evident in the superb battle scenes, especially a stunning re-creation of the landing at Omaha beach.The movie is sold in 2 DVD editions: Dolby Digital, and DTS.  The Dolby Digital edition contains a making-of featurette that mentions a real-life WWII story in which 4 brothers fought and died in the war; the story obviously inspired the movie.

661087,"I have watched both dubbed and subbed versions on this DVD, and I have to say I'm rather impressed with both of them.  However, FUNimation does tend to have the characters say rather ridiculous things during intense battles for I have no idea why; and I've found some grammatical errors that do tend to be rather annoying at times.  At the back of the DVD case, it said &quot;May contain violence and brief nudity,&quot; which didn't make sense to me at all.  This movie DOES contain violent scenes, but I didn't find any which included nudity.The story itself is rather weak and rather clich&eacute;.  Some evil planet/asteroid thing appears and threatens the entire existence of the Earth.  A big mess happens and Goku always manages to win in the end.  However, there is a nice twist with the villains having to make the atmosphere breathable in order to use Earth as their new cruiser-thing.What rather bugged me was Goku's Super Saiya-jin transformation.  His hair didn't even turn gold, which allows a lot of people to say, &quot;He didn't even turn Super Saiya-jin, so, why is it in the movie's title?&quot;Also, the dub's music tend to disturb me from time to time.  They mostly used music from hard rock groups in the soundtrack (not that any of the groups are bad or anything), and this itself didn't bother me, it just seems when the music cued in, it didn't seem very appropriate at all.  At times, it ruined the drama and the suspense of certain scenes which you could definately feel in the subtitled version.So, really, this movie does have its weak points, and its strong points, so they're pretty much even.

566326,"It's not everyday that we get an original horror movie with an intelligent plot, likeable characters, a traffic-stopping cast and chills beyond our imagination. But do you think &quot;Urban Legends: Final Cut&quot; is one of them? Oh, no. The film, being a sequel to the first film, is the latest in a long, long, long, long line of sequels which do no justice to the predecessor, and not only that, but it copies directly off of &quot;Scream 2&quot; and &quot;3,&quot; just like &quot;Urban Legend&quot; had the look and feel of a &quot;Scream&quot; wannabe. Do the producers of these movies sit around in a room and actually think this stuff is going to appeal to anyone with the least bit of intelligence and common sense? Do they think that our lives are so jaded by originality that they must inject us with banal characters, a washed up storyline, and a mess of total stupidity? Hollywood hates us!The movie is such a piece of undeniable trash that its story is just a pain to even look back on. We are introduced to select students of Alpine University, which is a renowned film school where, every year, one person receives the Hitchcock Award for the best thesis film. This sparks the attention of dithy documentarian Amy Mayfield, who jumps into the project after hearing a story from Reese, the new campus security guard and the sole returning character from the first film.She writes her script, which, wouldn't you know it, is about tall tales known as urban legends, and begins gathering up her cast and crew. She has some competition, though: Toby is filming a horror thriller that takes place on an airplane (shades of &quot;Final Destination,&quot; maybe?), and his cast and crew are much more dilligent. Others include Travis, whose film &quot;The Gods of Men&quot; is in the finishing stages, and Graham, whose the son of a Hollywood mogul.And this is where our killings take place, leaving us with dead bodies, useless plot twists, and a plot that borrows all it can from just about every horror franchise it can get its hands on. The movie even goes so far as to insult its own name, because its killings, with the exception of one, are not even considered urban legends in reality. Perhaps the writers just ran out of creativity, or the legends that were left weren't bloody and stupid enough for the demographic group this film aims itself at.And if there ever was a movie that copycats, this is it. The whole actors-involved-in-a-film-getting-killed-according-to-the-script thing has been done already, much better in &quot;Scream 3,&quot; but &quot;UL:FC&quot; doesn't seem to care. It treats the material as if its new and fresh, which leaves us with a wasted six dollars for a movie that we could've rented already. And the ending is so blatantly reminiscent of the on-stage showdown in &quot;Scream 2,&quot; which places our killer and prey on the set of some movie where they have access to all sorts of materials where they can prolong the inevitable ending in which the real killer will meet his demise. And don't even start criticizing me about giving away the ending: the plot's sky-high predictability factor will not only give away the identity of the killer, but will leave you with no surprises.The actors are your typical ensemble of pseudo-teenage college kids who have nothing better to do than run around and corner themselves into fatal situations than to actually use their heads. Jennifer Morrison plays Amy, who never comes off as being more than the average run-of-the-mill clueless college groupie, as does the rest of the cast composed mostly of unknowns who probably think that this movie will lead them to new heights of fame (what a mislead). It's easy to see why Joey Lawrence, of TV's &quot;Blossom,&quot; billed himself as &quot;Joseph.&quot; Be sure to look out for Rebecca Gayheart in a surprise cameo that is the cheese atop the cracker.There's something to be said about movies like this, movies that have absolutely no creativity and revel in that fact, but my mother taught me never to use words of that nature. In short, &quot;Urban Legends: Final Cut&quot; is yet another example of Hollywood wasting our money by giving us nothing new and thinking we'll be satisfied. If you must be scared, then be scared of the fact that, like it or not, this is the future of horror movies, and we're stuck with it.",N/A

All Style, No Substance... Hardly. Yes, it Glorifies Violence. So did ""Pulp Fiction"" and ""Reservoir Dogs"" and They are classed as Classics. In Time.. So with ""3KMTG"", but not your Regular Classic, it's a Cult Classic. The Definition of a Cult Classic is a film that Critics Hated, Audiences Ignored, gets Attention of Video due to a Built in Fan Base (Elvis fans.. Anyone) and Eventually grows into a Force to be Reckoned with. It'll Happen.. Oh yes..

Costner may not be Looking very Youthful these days, but he Acts with a Teens Energy as Thomas J Murphy, the Heathen with a Heart of Stone.

573656,"Don't get me wrong--&quot;Bounce&quot; is an entirely enjoyable little movie.  Ben Affleck plays a man who ultimately feels responsible for Gwyneth's husband's death in a plane crash.  So he waits a year, gets himself straightened out, and goes to apologize to her--only to find himself falling in love.Will they or won't they end up together?  The ending doesn't provide much suspense--the only real question is when Gwyneth is going to find out what happened.  To the filmmakers' credit, the scene is later than would be expected, which allows some tension to build.The major problem with this movie is that Ben Affleck never quite musters the dramatic intensity that is required of him in a few scenes.  There is one particularly uncomfortable moment when you want him to stop talking about his feelings--because he just isn't believable.  This is especially obvious when contrasted with Gwyneth's seemingly effortless performance.A good supporting cast, including Johnny Galecki of &quot;Roseanne&quot; fame and the too-little seen Tony Goldwyn.  A slight but enjoyable film--but I might recommend hitting the fast-forward button when Ben gets misty.",Bounce
65609,"&quot;The Bride of Frankenstein&quot; has less in common with films like &quot;Frankenstein&quot; and &quot;Dracula&quot; than it does with those made by von Sternberg and Dietrich (a la &quot;The Scarlet Empress&quot;) in relatively the same era.  Both &quot;Bride&quot; and these use their genre along with an excessive amount of bizzare, campy aesthetics to strangely both mask and accentuate a series of profoundly artful, but socialy unacceptable ideas.  Like Murnau with his horror masterpiece &quot;Nosferatu&quot; before him, it is often speculated that director Whale used &quot;Bride&quot; as a way of expressing his otherwise suppressed homosexuality.  Through this the film gains a very  uneasy atmosphere, which can certainly not be attributed to a scary monster.

82277,"Julia Roberts hit a home run with this 1990 hit which made her a superstar, when she won an Oscar  and Golden Globe for best actress in a leading role. It's a cross between Pygmalion(My Fair Lady) and Cinderella. This story finds Richard Gere, a cold, emotionless businessman who has become a billionaire tearing apart companies for their assets hiring &quot;Vivian&quot; a prostitute, to accompany him for the week he is doing business in LA.There are cute scenes of Julia learning to dress, buy clothes, use the proper fork. She's not quite as bad as the gal in Pygmalion, but then again, this is an R-rated version, so it's a sexier story, Imagine if Professor Higgins could bed his &quot;student,&quot; Eliza DoolittleAs far as the Cinderella side of this, Vivian comes from a tough &quot;hood&quot; that would eat her alive if it could. And yes, Richard Gere does come along and rescue her from the mean members of her &quot;hood&quot; family.Hector Alizondo has a great role, playing the all knowing, always wise hotel manager (think hispanic Yoda&lt;g&gt;) who helps Julia pull herself together.It's fun to see Jason Alexander as a bumbling creep (recently revisited in Shallow Hal.)The thing that puts that magic into this story is the character arcs Julia and Richard go through.Richard goes from an emotionally constricted, greedy financial power czar to become a kinder, more generous guy who cares about the people and the businesses he has been playing Monopoly with, and he (Big surprise) falls for Julia. (who wouldn't? &lt;G&gt;)Julia evolves to become a more self aware, sophisticated, but still playful and simple, honest and straightforward woman (though still a goodhearted &quot;'ho.&quot;) She has this wonderful, playful nature that loaned itself so well to this story line.This is, even after many other roles, still one of Julia's best (along with Notting Hill and Erin Brockovich.)  If you were, not surprisingly, disappointed with  America's Sweetheart, watch this film for a pick-me-up and a reminder of how good Julia can be.The film also won the best film of the year from the People's Choice Awards and Best Screenplay Written Directly for the Screen from the Writer's Guild of America.

It's kind of like &quot;The Music Man&quot; meets &quot;Quadrophenia&quot; meets &quot;Streets of Fire.&quot;  Very cool indeed.Story involves the emergence of Soho in the very early 1960's.  The whole Mod scene was just catching on and times were about to get very interesting, as the whole Northern Soul and R&amp;B sound was about to explode.  Features an awesome David Bowie, and, as always, the dazzling (despite being somewhat talent-hungry) Patsy Kensit.  Add to this, an impeccable soundtrack.I recall that when it came out, I first got the soundtrack lp just for the Vespa on the front. (Since I collect them, as well as Lambrettas).  Then, I flipped the lp over and saw the features.  Three words sealed the deal for me:  &quot;The Style Council.&quot;  Paul Weller and Mick Talbot are still among my personal idols.Get this movie.  It's very good and I know you won't regret it. Also get for &quot;Quadrophenia&quot; featuring very young &quot;bell-boy&quot; Sting.  It too captures the mod scene very well, and the clashes with greasers and the infamous &quot;Rumble in Brighton&quot; of which Sezter (a la the Stray Cats) sang.Also, check out &quot;Streets of Fire&quot; and &quot;Something Wild.&quot;  Particularly the latter has an INCREDIBLE soundtrack.",Absolute Beginners VHS

After the murder of a rival, Paul Allen (Jared Leto), a private investigator (Willem Dafoe) starts to pick up his trail as Bateman starts to go mental in covering his tracks.The plot is fairly thin on the ground, and the film has a poor shoot-out finale, but this is still an imaginable, carefully crafted film that is highly controversial because of it's continuous violence and rather odd sexual themes, but Christian Bale and Mary Harron work excellently and co-operate well together to make this film hugely successful with both critics and our friends at the box office. The film has a lot of laugh-out-loud funny moments, but if you're expecting a horror-thriller type, you won't be disappointed. There is no shortage of shocks; one immediately scary part is where Bateman chases his regular prostitute around a hotel room with a terrifying chainsaw sound. Christian Bale's performance is another great thing about this great movie; he perfectly catches Bateman's rise and fall with excellent acting skills and awesome narration.Both hip and cool, American Psycho is an underrated little movie that deserves praise.",American Psycho VHS

He plays a police officer almost on the verge of a nervous breakdown, who is obsessed with finding a kidnap victim before he is killed.

It was well paced and much shorter than those other would-be epics, even as it managed to provide a grander scope of the realm of humanity wrapped up in this story of chickens trying to escape doom at a farm.

They were subliminal hints and artistic freedom.

Ed was trying to say &quot;You don't have to be just a day person or a night person. Life is precious and you should live it to the fullest.&quot; He proved this point by hiring Bela to be in the movie despite his poor health. Yes he was replaced halfway through the movie after his death, but Ed was saying &quot;No one is indespensible. If you die you are replaced.&quot; This is a beautiful message, espescially to those who's ego or head is just too big.Vampira, beautiful and sureal, cannot be denied star billing in this flick. She has not one line. Ed was saying 'Women be silent!&quot;. Not that he was a cheuvanist, but he liked to wear women's clothes (true story!). SO if he ever got caught wearing one of his female friend's clothing, he'd want her to keep quiet and not tell anyone.All in all, this film will leave you spellbound.

Which is, when one considers it, maybe not purely tragic.

338032,"In &quot;The Lost Boys,&quot; Jason Patric and Corey Haim play the two sons of the recently-become-single Dianne Wiesst, who move with her back to the small, coastal, California town where she grew up.  This town is unusual in two key respects.  First, it has a really cool amusement park.  Second, it is totally overrun by blood-sucking, demonic creatures of darkness and part time Jim Morrison fans -- yes, that's right, vampires.  Corey Haim becomes friends with the Poe brothers, Edgar and Allen, played by Corey Feldman and an actor who looks sort of like a cross between a young Scott Baio and Ralph Machhio from &quot;The Karate Kid.&quot;  The Poe brothers give him the lowdown on their hometown.  He disbelieves them at first, but later comes to call upon the vampire-slaying expertise they have acquired as professional merchants of horror comic books.  Meanwhile, Jason Patric has developed the mutually reciprocated hots for the gypsy-wild Jami Gertz, whose homelessness in no way compromises her considerable babe-ossitude, and who, it turns out, is a sort of vampire moll.This movie combines humor and horror in an unusual, very successful manner.  It reminds me of &quot;Scream&quot; in that way, or the old Abbott and Costello horror movies.  The only problem with this movie, as far as I can tell, is that it doesn't deliver quite enough goods.

532343,"These days any film associated with comics is likely to be a special effects extravaganza full of action and short on character development. Well director M. Night Shyamalan has taken us in a different direction, (no surprise there). His film, &quot;Unbreakable&quot;, explores the action comic philosophy without becoming an action comic itself. You won't see  men in spandex leaping from tall buildings to save the day. What you will see is a thoughtful investigation of the unusual skills we humans may or may not have, and the choices we make regarding their use.I have a talent for putting holes in T-shirts. My sister can permanently stop any watch she wears for a few weeks. It's hard to see either of us becoming crime fighters or maniacal masterminds on the strength of these talents but it does makes you think. Let's stretch our imaginations a little further. What if a man had the uncanny luck to avoid virtually all injury or illness? Could this be significant? Would he even notice? Where would it lead him?Unbreakable introduces us to such a man. Bruce Willis plays David Dunn, the sole survivor of a tragic train derailment that killed the other 131 passengers. David walks away without a scratch and barely notices his fifteen minutes of fame on the local news channels. But at least one other person takes note of David's uncanny good fortune. Elijah Price is an art dealer, played convincingly by Samuel L Jackson. His gallery specializes in comic art and he is very passionate about the seriousness of his chosen profession and it's medium.Elijah believes that action comics represent an ancient wisdom, exaggerated and commercialized but still containing an essence of truth. His theory is that there are  people with extraordinary abilities and that these people have a destiny. Whether these people become legendary hero's or any other larger than life figure depends on them realizing their destiny and fulfilling their potential. In David Dunn, he suspects lies the heart of a hero and Elijah's obsession soon drags David and his family into a new world.Shyamalan takes his time with this story. It could have very easily been boring, because when boiled down, little actually happens. However, Unbreakable avoids that trap and becomes instead, a strange mixture of longing, suspense and doubt. We truly get to know David's wife Audrey and his son Joseph. They are not an atypical family; marital problems, boredom and some other dysfunctions feature at the start of the story. In a way, David's gradually more serious attempts to explore his &quot;gift&quot; become the catalyst to improve his home life.The sub-plot of David's crumbling relationship with Audrey, (Robin Wright), is not fully explored but we are given several clues that make it interesting. David is chasing job offers in another city, even after the accident little emotion passes between he and Audrey, and they sleep separately. All of which points to a lack of love. But to counter this we discover that David sacrificed a promising football career to capture Audrey's heart and, even in the hardest times, he has remained faithful to her. I like these quiet story lines, where nothing is forced down your throat and you have to work it out on your own.By far the most interesting character is Elijah. Born with a brittle bone disease, his life  has been crowded with pain, torment and ostracism. At school he was taunted with the moniker, &quot;Mr. Glass&quot;, and to an extent he has embraced this title. If you look closely, you will see that he is always close to glass, for example, his fragile glass walking stick. Elijah is a fighter. His mother headed off a life of seclusion when he was a depressed boy and convinced him to accept life's challenges, eventually leading to his becoming a professional success. Elijah's passion and conviction are magnetic. He not only draws David and his son into the world of duty/destiny but the audience is forced to believe, long before David starts to.Unbreakable is a subtle film about taking risks, acknowledging hope and following dreams. Whether we have special gifts or not, it challenges us to take a look around and try to find opportunities to make a difference; to stand up to the small and large evils in this world and do our part. I can only hope we see more of these inspiring characters in future films. I want to feel this way again.",Unbreakable
132973,"Relationships and the problems faced by people just trying to get through the day and make some sense of their lives is explored in ""You Can Count On Me,"" written and directed by Ken Lonergan.  The story focuses on Samantha ""Sammy"" Prescott (Laura Linney), a single mother living in a small town in New York State, who has worked at the same bank for seven years while raising her son, Rudy (Rory Culkin), on her own.  Then one day her brother, Terry (Mark Ruffalo), whom she has not seen for sometime, shows up.  He moves in with Sammy and Rudy, and for awhile provides Sammy with some help, especially with Rudy; it's a welcome respite from juggling her work schedule and trying to do it all herself.  And it takes some of the pressure off, as her new boss, Brian Everett (Matthew Broderick), is a stickler who takes exception to Sammy having to leave early every day to pick up her son from school.  At about this same time, however, an on-again-off-again relationship Sammy has had with a man named Bob Stegerson (Jon Tenney) begins to get complicated, while the situation at home starts to tweak in the wake of some questionable decisions made by Terry that involve Rudy.  And-- as if all that weren't enough-- inexplicably, at work sparks suddenly begin to fly between Sammy and Brian.Lonergan does an excellent job of bringing his story to life.  The Screenplay is well written and intelligent, and offers some real insight into the human condition by embracing the very flaws and foibles of which we are all endowed, and which we all must deal with in one way or another in our own lives.  It's an engrossing, emotionally gripping film that presents very real characters and situations, and one of it's strengths is in the honesty, of not only the actions, but the ""reactions"" of the people playing out the drama.  And it's that genuine sincerity at the core of the story that makes this film so effective and believable.  Well directed and acted, it's quite simply an affecting and memorable film.Laura Linney has never been better than she is here, and deservedly received an Oscar nomination for her performance as Sammy.  She has a thorough grasp of the character that makes her real-- this imperfect woman and mother coping with the stress in her life and just trying to do the best she can and what she thinks is right.  Her portrayal acknowledges Sammy's strengths and vulnerability, as well as the fact that people change and relationships evolve; that what may have been right for her a year ago isn't necessarily what she needs today.  Sammy is a complex character, and Linney convincingly takes her through a wide range of emotional levels that evokes empathy for her and makes her someone you care about.Terry is a complex character as well, a young man with a good heart, lacking perhaps some personal direction, but whose biggest fault may be that he cares too much and feels too deeply.  And Ruffalo plays him perfectly.  Like a young Brando, he hits every note just right in bringing Terry to life.  He has a natural, charismatic and extremely engaging screen presence, and he is absolutely terrific in this role.  He's a gifted actor from whom we can expect great things in the future.Also giving a solid performance is the always reliable Broderick, who admirably continues to take some career chances with roles such as this one, as he did with the part of the teacher, Jim McAllister, in ""Election.""  In both cases, they are ordinary yet flawed characters who are not necessarily ingratiating in any way, but as played by Broderick they are at least people to whom one can definitely relate.The supporting cast includes Ken Lonergan (Ron), Gaby Hoffman (Sheila), Kim Parker (Rudy Sr.'s Girlfriend) and Josh Lucas (Rudy Sr.).  With ""You Can Count On Me,"" Lonergan delivers a tender and poignant story with something of a wistful ending, the impact of which is enhanced by the very reality of it's characters and situations.  And there are humorous moments, as well, that evolve naturally from the story, just as they do in real life.  In the end, this is transporting drama with which many will be able to identify, for the roads it travels are the same ones many of those who see it will have been down themselves.",N/A

He wasn't always convincing, but this I'll blame on the writer giving him an impossible, unconvincing character. The writer was preaching, and he preached an interesting movie.

148853,"I'm not really a fan of Sergio Leone or the Western genre, but as a CW buff I find this film to be very impressive.I've read that this movie was adapted from a short film Luciano Vincenzoni made about a group of guys stuck between the lines during WWI, Vincenzoni and Leone decided to adapt the story to the American Civil War and set it in the Far West.  You may think that the film's Civil War background is just a composite of generic vignettes, but the writers did base the film on an actual event from the Civil War.The event is Sibley's New Mexico Campaign of 1861-1862, when a brigade of about 3,000 Confederates under the command of Henry Hopkins Sibley invaded the Union Territory of New Mexico from Texas.  The Confederates clashed with Union troops on several occasions, finally losing most of their supply wagons at the battle of La Glorietta Pass, which compelled the grey troops to retreat back to Texas, in a ragged, starving condition, closely pursued by the Federal forces under Col. Canby.TGTBATU correctly portrays the seesawing nature of the campaign control of the territory passed between the two forces.  The setting in Spain also matches the landscapes of New Mexico and northwestern Texas.  The artillery, however, was borrowed from a Spanish museum and is not accurate to the period nor are the rear-loading versions of the Colt 1851 Navy revolvers.  Also, there were no railroads in New Mexico at the time.Another error is made in the uniforms of the Confederate soldiers.  The film correctly reproduces the regulation jackets which are trimmed in yellow for cavalry, blue for infantry and red for artillery (however, it can be seen that all of the coats have plain brass buttons, unlike the originals which would have had insignia), but coats with the expensive trim were rarely seen even on the more important Eastern battlefields and the Confederate troops who fought with Sibley were probably equipped with little uniform clothing.  Also the regiments that fought with Sibley were all organized as mounted troops.Another thing that impressed me about the film was the image of a group of individuals living in the &quot;No-Man's Land&quot; between the two armies.  Throughout the Civil War a motley collection of dispossessed civilians, prostitutes, escaped slaves, army deserters, spies, guerrillas and bandits prowled on the edges of the field armies.  These groups receive relatively little coverage in either history or fiction seeing as so little was recorded about them.I found the presentation of a hypothetical group of these individuals as seen in TGTBATU to be highly intriguing.  The premise is that a national army is the supreme manifestation of LAW, and that when two armies, essentially two opposing forms of law are present, there will be a vacuum of lawlessness that fills the void between the two bodies- an ideal place for three men to be ruled by only their base instincts, be they Good, Bad or Ugly.The DVD quality is good, and includes previously unreleased (in the US) scenes deleted from the original version of the film.  The dialogue in these scenes is in Italian (with English subtitles) and presents not only a few more bits of interest in understanding the central characters, but also a few more Civil War vignettes such as a shattered Confederate fort and hospital, as well as a Confederate camp.",N/A

492085,"&quot;The Hobbit&quot;, taken from the book &quot;The Hobbit&quot; written by J.R.R. Tolkien, is loads of family enjoyment!The story begins introducing a small hobbit named Bilbo Baggins, who is the same as almost every hobbit; he loves peace and calm, and doesn't even have the slightest wish to have an adventure. But when the wizard Gandalf appears at his home, his life is turned topsy-turvey along with the arrival of Thorin and Co., 13 homeless dwarfs. They are in search of a 'burglar' to help them take back what is rightfully theirs, the treasure stolen from them by the evil dragon, Smaug. Bilbo of course refuses to have any part of them but very much against his will is pulled into their adventure. But it won't be easy. They must cross over the Edge of the Wild, go over the Misty Mountains, then go through the dark Mirkwoods. Along they way they must also fight against trolls, goblins, the savage Warfs, giant spiders, and other unknown dangers. Will they be able to make it to the Lonely Mountains? But Bilbo is thinking, even if they make it there, will they be able to defeat the dragon who awaits them there?Terrific tale, and if you haven't read the book, I truly recommend you that you read it. But I can give this movie only 4 stars. This movie does have its good points. I love it how it is close to the book, the people who did the voices of all the characters were perfect for the parts, and it's enjoyable for people all ages. I love it also the music, and they used Tolkien's words and lines from the book.But it does has some weak points. One, as most people pointed out, many major events were taken out of the movie. Most noticeably is there is no mention of one of my favorite characters in the book, Beorn the man/bear and the end was a little different, too. Also, the animation isn't that good, not at all like the newer computer animated movies. This may dissapoint many people and teenagers especially if they're not patient enough to watch it through.Still, it is good family fun and I recommend this movie. I haven't seen next of the animated &quot;Lord of the Rings&quot; trilogy, &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot;, but I have seen &quot;The Return of the King&quot;. I did not think much of that at all.

453940,"Basket Case is WAY out there and so sick that the mouths of those watching it fall open in disbelief. This movie was made outside of Hollywood; the sets consists of a seedy flophouse (not a Hollywood soundstage designed to look like a flophouse), a 42nd street grindhouse movie theater, and what looks like an abandoned building that is supposed to be a doctor's office. The actors and extras look like they were not saleried but worked for a chance to be on film and/or a bottle of wine. There was not much money to be spent on this movie. Instead, this horror masterpiece relied on imagination and a twisted sense of humor to make it work. The story concerns a pair of separated Simease twins. Duane, the normal (normal as in being able to walk on his own and not scare people with his looks) carries his brother around in a wicker basket.

Filmmaker Bruce Ricker lets the 1968 film, shot by Michael and Christian Blackwood, speak for itself, interspersing stills, interviews, and some equally priceless early Fifties television footage.  The 1968 film is shot in gorgeous black and white; the dark smoky club is especially impressive, visually.Monk himself is imposing in black and white, with his greatcoat, pointy beard, and assorted headwear.  In one scene he rolls into the recording studio wearing a lensless eyeglass frame and a Polish cavalry officer's cap.  He shambles through the film, all sweat and bulk and cigarettes and raspy voice.  There are a couple of great shots of his distinctive, spinning dancing, full of little surprises.The recording studio scene is fascinating on a couple of levels.  We get to see Monk and sax sideman Charlie Rouse go over the score of a song together.  But we are also reminded that this is the late Sixties, when jazz isn't selling, and Monk is not a legend yet.  The clueless producer and recording engineer, while friendly, keep telling him to play something to warm up, and then neglecting to record it.  Monk finally loses patience and stomps off to a corner to angrily suck down a cigarette.The film also records a European tour, which also has its problems.  The octet that is supplied to him for the tour is oversized and under-rehearsed.  They learn their parts on the plane to London, and can't get it together onstage the first night there.  Much to the band's embarrassment, Monk has to stop songs to get everyone back on track.  But in a day or two they shine, and receive rapturous applause.The tour has its lighter moments.  Perhaps the funniest moment is Monk lying in his bed in a Copenhagen hotel, trying to get his familiar down home cooking from room service. &quot;Say, man; you got any chicken livers?&quot; &quot;Umm...Ve haff chicken sahlad.&quot; &quot;You got any regular liver?&quot; &quot;Regular...&quot; &quot;Beef liver?&quot; &quot;Umm...Ja, ve haff beef liffer.&quot;Here and there we meet a surprise guest.  Some late Fifties/early Sixties New York club concert footage shows a room full of heavy-lidded white hipsters enjoying music by Monk and none other than John Coltrane.  In a club kitchen, Monk clowns with Baroness Nica, who befriended many jazz musicians and in whose apartment Charlie Parker died.  There's a montage of his records, including _Underground_, which boasts the single coolest album cover in the history of recorded music.  The interview segments, with T. S. Monk, Jr. and Monk's manager are touching, giving insight as to how Monk struggled with the black dog, depression.  And a couple of greybeards play some of Monk's music arranged for two pianos.  It's lovely, fitting for the tribute it is.  Just like this film.",N/A

Sexual innuendos, perverse seens hamper this movie.  Jim Carrey did an excellent job portraying the duality of the character.  The fault with this movie lay in the directing.  The Farrelly brothers continue their profane attack on Hollywood.  I don't think its ok to drop moral standards just for a cheap laugh.

The story drives you in different directions but with high Adrenalin rushing through your body right from the begining of the movie.

Usually thriller movies are played by young actors. It is very rare to find a thriller played by a GIANT ACTOR such as Harrison Ford and actress Michelle Pfeiffer.2.

Because he has no plans for Christmas Eve, he holds staff meetings on the holiday and doesn't seem to mind disrupting other people's lives.

Cameos from Richard Pryor and George Carlin spice it up a little, but it's mostly the music, the clothes and those 'fros that make this a film you shouldn't miss.

221242,"Ok, since it seems that the real question in many of the reviews here is whether or not GF2 is better than GF1, I figure I should address that in my review.  First though, I want to say that the Godfather 2 is a masterpiece.  Every bit of the buetiful story telling that made the first so amazing is here and Robert Dinero gives what is maybe the best performance of his career.That said, the Godfather 2 stills pales in comparison to the Godfather.  Since some reviews have asked why anyone could consider GF1 better than GF2, I shall attempt to make it clear why (my English teacher would kill me for such a boring sentence).  First of all, GF2 lacks the sublty of GF1.  Coppola said that the only way we would make the film was if he could destroy the family and he does this.  Unfortunatly he goes to far and the characters become almost parodies of themselves.  The best example of this is when Michael has Fredo killed at the end.  Yes it is an amazing scene and very powerful but it is simply out of character.  Fredo's betrayal is also stretching it somewhat.  In the Godfather the characters felt more realistic.  Their actions in GF2 feel more heavy-handed than in the first.Another major difference is the quality of the acting and character development.  First of all, Brando and Caan are dead now and Duval plays a less prominant role.  Dinero, while excellent, still can't equall the impact of those two great performances.  The real difference is Michael.  In the Godfather we watched him slowly grow from a young American who wants nothing to do with his family businesse to a ruthless mobster.  There is far less development in GF2.  Michael simply gets worse.  He is becomes slightly more zombie-like over the course of the film but there is really little to no character growth.This is why GF is still a better film than GF2.  The Godfather:  Part II will just have to settle for being the greatest sequel ever made.",N/A
399920,"I've been wanting to see The City of Lost Children ever since it first came out.  It was worth the wait!  I would include this film on my list of favourite movies of all time.  This is a delicious piece of surreal steampunk, tying together elements of fairy tale and mythology.  It's exactly like one of my dreams, but you can think of it as Blade Runner meets Popeye and Oliver Twist.The film opens with a little kid watching Santa Claus emerge from the chimney.  I thought, &quot;That's one creepy-looking Santa!&quot; but the kid didn't seem to mind.  Then there was a good reason for the kid to get good and freaked out, so my first impression was vindicated.Some reviewers focus on the scenery of this movie, which is admittedly top-notch, but I am enthralled by the characters.  I'd like to know how this movie was cast.  Did the director do a cattle call for weird-looking people?  I think he must have, because the only folks who fit in the middle of the bell curve are the children and one prostitute.The director walks a thin line with his imagery.  With a slightly different cant, it could be considered kinky and fetishistic.  A lot of attention is paid to bare feet.  Two scenes show a dog lovingly licking a man's foot for a prolonged period, and another scene exhibits One giving 9-year old Miette an equally loving foot massage.  Somehow, it doesn't seem pervy, but strangely appropriate.The City of Lost Children has obviously become an influential movie.  For example, The Matrix borrows heavily from it.  Just watch the dream-sharing sequences of City and compare it with the matrix-entry scenes of The Matrix.  If that doesn't do it for you, compare the names of the central heroes.",N/A

I think the cheap replacement of Rodimus Prime is horrible and he was never as great as Optimus was.  The other think I can't seem to understand is why the creators felt the need to put a curse word in a movie that the main audience is going to be 10 and under.  What were they thinking?

But I can deal with that I suppose cause a couple of those were pretty crappy anyway. It's just that there's something missing in this movie. It's as if this movie was just made for the revival of the teen horror genre that was big at the time not as a continuation of Halloweens 1 and 2. The teenagers are really annoying in this movie. There is no character development. And Michael Meyers is one of the more bland characters in the movie. He isn't scary like he was in others in the series. Yeah, he was your typical 80's killer like Jason and Freddy in parts 1-6, but he had more depth back then. Not only does this movie disregard parts 4-6, it seems to disregard parts 1 and 2.

522596,"Adapted from the novel by Michael Chabon, this offbeat dark comedic drama is set at a college in Pittsburgh, a shabby city of bleak weather and aging buildings.  Michael Douglas is cast in the role of Grady Tripp, a college professor long past his prime who lives in haze of marijuana and failing marriages.  He's gained weight for this role and his face is lined and drooping, capturing the essence of the character so well that he was able to submerge his movie star image.  Tripp is a former &quot;wonder boy&quot; who had been acclaimed for his first novel seven years before.  Unfortunately, even though he has written more than 2000 pages on his second novel, he can't seem to bring it to completion even though his New York agent, Terry Crabtree, played by Robert Downey Jr. will be in town for the writer's weekend set up at the college.Tobey Maguire, the rising young actor who made a name for himself in &quot;The Cedar House Rules&quot; is cast as James Leer, a brilliant and troubled young writer from Tripp's class.  And Frances McDormand is cast as the Chancellor of the college who's having an affair with Trip.  Katie Holmes plays a student who is interested in Tripp for more than his teaching ability.  Other characters fade in and out of the scenes, adding interest and contributing to an eclectic mix and which somehow all add to the cohesive whole.  There's a transvestite as well as a professor affixed on Marilyn Monroe as well as a black man in a pompadour hairdo and his waitress wife. And, in addition to the people, there's a vintage car and an old manual typewriter and an electric selectric.  There's also a dead dog.All this is put together in a mix that gently pokes fun at it all, played for pathos and humanity instead of slapstick.  And it is all slightly off focus in the marijuana haze created by the professor.  I did find it a bit slow and I sometimes dozed off.  But the beauty of video is that could wake up and replay the few frames I missed.  I was always rewarded because of the subtleties of dialog and nuances of the acting and of the fine direction by Curtis Hanson, whose last film was L.A. Confidential.  I recommend this video although it is not for everyone.  It's quirky and offbeat and the pace is slow and hazy.  But I personally thought it was really good.",N/A

You could tell that it was thrown together rather quickly, (due to the sets for Marco Polo not being ready some have said), and while there are good moments, the sound was not very good and Hartnell (who is my favorite Doctor BTW) did flub his lines alot.

He comes back to his best friends, the good-natured but hopelessly crazy Jackie Flannery (The great Gary Oldman in what is possibly his best performance) and the sweet but dumb Stevie (The also excellent John C.

Frankie is trying to make a deal with the nearby Italian mob (led by Paul Vitterelli, before he became a more comedic mobster), and the tensions are running high when Frankie is called upon to betray his own people for the Italians, and Terry is forced to betray his people for an entirely different reason. Make no mistake: This is a VERY Irish tale. They drink, fight, scream, smoke, beat, shoot, stab, cry, puke, lust, kill and they do it all like it's going out of style.

120198,"Oliver Stone likes beating up the people who decide to watchhis movies.He does it here not to show us El Salvador, or a famousrock band or politics , or how the media assaults us,or even theVietnam War,-- he does it because of football.FOOTBALL?And he has nothing more to say than was already very well stated in a much better film, North Dallas Forty.There aren't just  five or six multiple quick cut establishing shots to begin nearly every scene in this film, there are a dozens.  There are strange shots which make no sense whatsoever but merely serve as something that was shot to stick between two other shots.  There are triple and quadruple angles on charging football players, shots from inside football helmets, crane shots, steadicam shots, and lots of tracking and hand held shots.  You don't get any sense of what play is being run however. You're not ever shown a complete play from start to finish.  We just get chaos.There are huge booming bangs and mini-explosions as football player tackle each other and then suddenly, the sound disappears completely.  There's slow-mo, there's some digitally altered work with motion and speed.  It's all here.Why?To excite, titilate, entertain, overwhelm and bulldoze an audience into thinking it's watching an important Oliver Stone movie of course.Because of the flash and over-kill it takes Stone a full 45 minutes to set up the film. It could have been done in ten.  Lots of characters to introduce us to.  None of them are original and none of them will have any depth.  Oh sure there's an impressive list of actors on view, and I almost expected Bruce Dern as a terrorist and the Goodyear blimp to show up.  The plot?  Not a lot to that either. The Miami Sharks have lost 4 games straight and the once great team may not make the play-offs.  It's star quarterback is getting old and yikes... gets badly injured.  Out of nowhere the third string quarterback shows promise, but he's not a team player.  The coach has lost his fire for the game.  The new team owner is a young overly ambitious woman who wants to prove she can more ruthless and heartless than anyone.. even Steinbrenner!!!  She wants to win and doesn't care who she has to threaten, fire, or manipulate to do it.  Sound familiar?Of course it does.All of the characters we meet in Any Given Sunday are familiar and you the viewer can color them in.  In fact, you better have a lot crayons  because as these characters are written there isn't much offered in terms of depth or nuance.  Nuance?  Who's got time for such things in a 2 and a half hour Oliver Stone movie.  Now pardon me while I add some elements to this shot... I'll have some music playing, I'll have a sports guy on the television talking quite negatively about the coach of the Sharks (Al Pacino) while he sits in the crowded bar getting very drunk (what a man!) and is propositioned by a young high priced hooker, Elizabeth Berkley.  They'll seem like there are five or six things  going on at once.  Of course none of it is very important, or original, but  the audience will be just over-whelmed with all this stuff, all this detail.  Well unimportant, details... but lots of them.  Movement, noise, lots of cuts.There are some great shots in this movie.  But when you throw this much at the wall, some of it has to stick.Occasionally, when you senses aren't being over-loaded and assaulted by a chaotic cacophony of sound, camera movement and weird quick cuts and camera angles, you realize there are some really awful bits of dialogue being spouted in this film. In fact there are several scenes which really needed a zinger, a clever line, a nice bit of business, a special moment, to make the scene work or even have any purpose whatsoever-and  we get nothing.  It lies there.  Well it doesn't lie there exactly because we are always cutting, the camera is always moving.There might be some people who are fooled by this technique, but most will get very tired of it after the films first half hour.  It doesn't build, it has no where to go, it's already started at a manic over-the top level.  Where is it going to go?What's really annoying is how repetitive the film.  You have all these camera angles, all these tricks, all this coverage of every conceivable angle. . . from a puppet master director who doesn't trust his audience, his script or even his actors.  He manipulates every single aspect of what we are watching.  Rarely is a shot held for move than a few seconds.  He keeps moving but it's over the same territory over and over and over again.It wides up not being exhilarating, not being revealing, just head-ache inducing.Over and over and over again we are shown bits of pieces of the game in almost the same way. Once, twice, three and four times we see similar types of shots of crowds, fans, coaches, players, refs, cheerleaders, people in the press box...(.  Eeek.. There's Oliver Stone doing play by play announcing) not just introducing the big game... but as a prelude to every game we see, even to one of the practices.  Look look...  We got a big budget to spend and we can hire lots of extras... I can shoot lots and lots of film.  Looky Looky...!!!!It gets really ridiculous at times if you're not too numb and utterly desensitized to pay attention. Like when we hear an announcer on t.v.  talking about `a swirl of events', and the camera is on a team graphic and begins to swirl slightly as it cuts to another shot, probably one of a team flag, there's lots of shots of team flags.  What clever, brilliant, film-making.There's nothing new here, just flash and more flash on a subject that's been written about and filmed many times and more effectively than Stone manages to do. Go see North Dallas Forty, or Hoop Dreams again before bothering with this time-waster that will wind up making aspirin manufacturers some extra profits.I can just imagine Oliver Stone someday doing a commentary track for this film (he doesn't on DVD out now) and talking about how shortened  attention spans ,challenged him to create the ultimate modern football/gladiator movie.  A movie where the game is more than a game.  And of course when a game becomes more important than just a game it means the participants must sacrifice everything real--marriages, morals, even ethics and so his movie sacrifices everything in presenting the GAME.  Uh-huh.  Even if Stone were to actually say something like this, it would be far more interesting than anything he has presented to us in this chaotic, numbing, repetitive, headache inducing, everything but the kitchen sink two and a half hour update of  ESPN's best of Sport Center: The  Football edition  he has the temerity to call a film.Chris Jarmick, Author of The Glass Cocoon with Serena F.

Arriving in time for the funeral, where he takes note of those in attendance, Martins afterwards makes the acquaintance of a select few who knew and were involved with his old friend, Harry, beginning with a representative of the authorities, a certain Major Calloway (Trevor Howard).  Lime, it seems, was a wanted man, connected with some nefarious dealings on the black market.  Initially, Martins is skeptical, but it's only the beginning of the mystery that is about to unfold about him.In talking with those who knew Lime best, especially those present at the time of the accident, Martins begins to notice some inconsistencies in their accounts of what happened that day.  And the one discrepancy that bothers him the most is that in the official report, two men were said to have carried Lime-- just after he was hit-- from the street to the sidewalk, still alive at that point; but an eyewitness Martins uncovers claims that, not only was Lime killed instantly, but that another man-- a third man-- helped carry him.  So the mystery begins; the report says two men were with him when he died, and heard his last words.  A reliable witness, however, puts someone else at the scene.  And Martins realizes that therein lies the key; that to find out what really happened to Harry, he must learn the identity of the third man.Working from the exceptionally well written screenplay by Graham Greene, Reed rivals the best of Hitchcock with this richly textured, stylistic offering.  The mystery begins to mount with the opening narration (by Reed in the British version, by Cotton in the U.S.)-- delivered in a conversational tone that is in itself unique compared to the usual cinematic narrative form-- and the tension-filled suspense begins to build from the moment Martins arrives, and is maintained by Reed until the denouement.  And-- in a sense--beyond, right up until the final frame of the film.  Outstanding performances, combined with the stark black &amp; white photography (for which cinematographer Robert Krasker won an Oscar)-- enhanced by Reed's artistic handling of the camera and his use of light and shadows-- as well as the zither-driven score by Anton Karas, makes this one of the most memorable mysteries ever filmed.Cotton delivers a brilliantly understated performance as Martins, which provides a solid foundation upon and around which the mystery surrounding Lime develops.  And though Lime is afforded little actual screen time as Martins assembles the bits and pieces he's uncovered through his investigation, his enigmatic presence is felt in every scene as if he were there.  When he does appear, Welles embodies him in such a way that the mystique of this man that has been so cleverly and acutely developed is effectively maintained.  Welles, in fact, with his naturally dominating countenance was the perfect choice to play Lime, and he certainly delivers.  His few scenes with Cotton, especially one that takes place on a ferris wheel (which offers a telling perspective into Lime's character), are the most memorable of the entire film.Cotton's performance, however, is the real thread that holds it all together, and as Martins, he demonstrates his generosity as an actor; for it's that ""regular guy"" persona with which he imbues his character, that insures the emergence of Welles' Lime as so larger-than-life.  The same can be said, as well, for the effectiveness with which the mystery of the woman in Lime's life, Anna (Alida Valli), is established.  Again, Martins becomes the sounding board through which Valli's character reverberates so convincingly.  Her performance is strong, but her interaction with Cotton allows her Anna to shine all the more brightly.  It's a perfect example of having all the elements that go into the making of a film working together to produce a true classic in every sense of the word.The supporting cast includes Paul Horbiger (Porter), Ernst Deutsch (Kurtz), Erich Ponto (Dr. Winkel), Siegfried Breuer (Popescu), Hedwig Bleibtreu (Old Woman), Bernard Lee (Sergeant Paine) and Wilfrid Hyde-White (Crabbin).  Intelligently conceived and written, and imaginatively and creatively delivered, ""The Third Man"" is a masterpiece that works on every conceivable level.  The purity of the film is inspiring; the integrity of the story is never compromised in any way by the sensationalism or cheap gimmicks that seem to plague even the best of today's offerings-- the fact of which many contemporary filmmakers would be well advised to take notice.  In the final analysis, this is simply a truly exceptional film; one that belongs in the library of every serious collector.",The Third Man VHS

Suffice it to say that you really should save yourself the agony if you haven't.The film could easily have ended if a parent had driven the car.(film)Brother: Did not!Sister: Did too!Brother: Did not!Sister: Did too!(divine intervention from parent): You kids either shut up or I'm going to turn this car around!!Other problems with this movie:1. Our demonic creature, invincible--even invulnerable--and scary, can fly...yes, FLY...yet feels compelled to drive (yes, DRIVE) around incognito in a truck stolen from the DUEL (nod to a good film by Spielberg) studio lot in a disguise that would have made DARKMAN say, &quot;Oh, please.&quot;2. Is this creature scary?*Yes!*After you?*Oh, yes, please someone stop it!*Is it eating a victim?*Why, yes it is...let's watch, sis, whaddya say?*Most people run when they have a chance, but not our &quot;static&quot; duo...they're going to watch every gruesome moment as our hero...um...demon begins to eat someone's head.3. The scarecrow scene. Was there a point? Did the demon really feel compelled to use a ruse that was devised more to scare the audience then to serve any meaningful purpose within the story's context? Also, what was up with the CATS???? The movie was creepy enough without some deranged woman who attempts to be creepy, but is just downright eccentric and in need of better lighting for her house. Advice: use Yellow Pages.4. Victims. Victims galore. Over 500 and counting in a deserted area. Did anyone ever think of looking? Even if they were all travelers, you think that the dragnet of law enforcement would sit and ponder, &quot;You know, those darned kids took the same route as the other 498 other missing cases in this darned area. Maybe we should ask that weird fellow at the abandoned building over yonder...seems kinda strange that there is a truck parked in front of it. *spitting and bell sound*&quot;5. Jeepers Creepers...where did you get those eyes...was this really meant to shock us at the end? Oh, the demon took the little fellow's eyes...what a surprise.6.  The CAR.  Oh, that hurt the most.  I could almost hear the director saying, &quot;Hey, Bob.  This scene needs some tension.  Whaddya think?&quot;  Bob:  &quot;Oh, I've got it!!  How about making the car difficult to start?!?  We haven't done that before!!&quot;  (repeat 6 times -- but when it's not necessary, make sure the car starts just fine like when they decide to run over the demon).  It was the first time that I can recall actually moaning out loud in a film every time I heard the engine grind.With some rework and common sense, this story could have worked beautifully. It's also nice to see a horror story that serves to perpetuate itself by not making us wonder if the demon died, but to let the demon survive. But the arguing between the two main characters who somehow manage to develop an undying bond near the film's end, a pointless psychic, a creature that obviously has no need for disguise if it can survive being run over by a car several times, law enforcement that practices &quot;let's stay in a huddle so one grenade could take us out&quot; tactics, and so on, was enough to make me say, &quot;What was that? And did you get the license plate number?&quot;",Jeepers Creepers
248035,"Okay, so even though I think the movie version of The Great Gatsby is by no means up to the standards of the book - it is still a decent movie.  Robert Redford plays Gatsby in a quiet, mysterious manner and although Mia Farrow goes a bit far in accentuating Daisy's ditzy behavior at times, she is still adequate in the part.  The musical score was dreamy and marvelous and actually won an academy award, but then when the movie was brought out on video they CHANGED this wonderful music.  I couldn't believe that the song &quot;What'll I do&quot; which is perfect for the scenes where Daisy and Gatsby are rekindling their love affair in a slow, delicous dance, was replaced by some nondescript, elevator music !!  What's the deal with that?The book is a classic and definitely has a 3-hanky ending.  I think the ending scene in the movie version sticks close enough to that eerie feeling to be worth watching.  However I would remind viewers that the current version has a disappointing musical score and is not the haunting, original academy award-winner.",N/A

11888,"Combine one of the most fascinating figures in history along with the directing efforts of one of the unquestioned giants of twentieth century cinema and you have the winning combination that exemplifies the 1962 international blockbuster, &quot;Lawrence of Arabia.&quot;T.E. Lawrence was an enigma to himself as well as those around him.  Too short to qualify for the British Army during World War One, Lawrence was given entry by special exemption.  Due to his passionate love for Middle East arcana, substantiated by archivist visits to the area, the erudite Lawrence was put in the Cairo Bureau office headed by General Edmund Allenby.  He proved an irritant and puzzle to the Sandhurst military types he confronted due to his uncanny ability to unearth the most minute details from maps as well as for his unconventionality, highlighted by an absence of military protocol.A deal was ultimately struck in which Allenby, believing that perhaps Lawrence could aid the British cause in the field, assigned him to the Arabian dessert in what would be described as a freelance effort.  His superior officers in the Cairo Bureau were delighted since he made them feel awkward and they were happy to rid themselves of someone they considered a young upstart lacking the requisite mindset to be a good British soldier.The rest is history as Lawrence was able to achieve unity by bringing together disparate tribal warriors who generally fought each other.  He filled them with incentive to rid themselves of the rule of Turkey's Ottoman Empire.  Those familiar with the hit and run tactics of the Viet Cong in the Vietnam War will see similarities in the way that Lawerence's warriors wait for the opportune moment, then strike when the better equipped, far more numerous Turkish forces are least aware.The project of bringing Lawerence's fascinating life to the screen was a challenge of veteran British director David Lean, who also crafted &quot;The Bridge on the River Kwai&quot; and &quot;Doctor Zhivago&quot;.  In the manner of &quot;Lawrence of Arabia,&quot; the other films were also magnificent technicolor dramas with broad international scope.  Screenwriter Robert Bolt crafted his superb script from Lawrence's autobiography, &quot;The Seven Pillars of Wisdom.&quot;  I found Lawrence fascinating enough to concentrate a lengthy chapter on him in my Middle East historical work, &quot;Struggle for the Holy Land.&quot;  Lawrence is brilliantly captured on screen by Peter O'Toole,who vaulted to international stardom with this role.  The film won 7 Oscars, including Best Picture, Best Director, and Best Cinematography.William Hare",N/A

When she saw it on TV it had many scenes cut (for time I imagine).Speaking of time. It's NOT 113 minutes. More like 125 minutes.Was Connery any good? Yes. His accent didn't bother me and he was the tough guy though not as proactive as some heroes. He used his instincts more than his gun. A plus in this film.It was more fun though to see the length of Bardot's hair vary from scene to scene and be amazed at how heavy and PERFECT her eyemake-up always remained. If you've seen Pam Anderson lately in 'VIP' you'd think this was her mom or something. They are quite alike.That said it's a pretty brutal western. There is a great deal of on-screen violence. Arrows fly. Flaming arrows hit more than wagons. The champagne isn't quite chilled to perfection either (you'll get this joke if you see the movie)Honor Blackman's character has a tragic death scene (shocking for it's brutality and unexpected). It was one of the more unusual I have seen on screen (and in a western). This was Peter Van Eyck's last movie. He even looks ill for most of it.Don't expect the calvary/U.S. Army to rescue anyone.

105875,"This may be an animated movie, but it is excellent in every sense of the word. In this tape we see that Batman and Superman are selfless heroes, but they are not without human weaknesses. Despite their benevolent characters, their egos make it difficult to work with each other at times. As someone who cherishes the writings of Charles Dickens, I have noticed that Dickens is usually careful not to make his heroes perfect. (Usually they have at least some human flaws.) The Joker and Harley Quinn STEAL this movie. Whatever people may have thought of the Joker up to this point, NO ONE is likely to underestimate him now. First he quickly hammers down the local thugs and lets them know it's either their loyalty or else. He finds the weaknesses of his opponents, takes advantage of the dissension between Batman and Superman, and fights them both quite well. Despite their crimes the Joker and Harley are a real lovable couple. They function as a team, they stand by each other, and it is clear that their relationship is a happy one. Lex seems little more than the Joker's stooge in this movie. The Joker manipulates him to get a shot at Superman; later the Joker's fight starts to spell trouble for Lex; Lex makes the fatal error of thinking he can outsmart the Joker and Harley; all too late, Lex realizes that PSYCHOTIC DOES NOT EQUAL STUPID!!! I never forgot the chills I felt when the Joker and Harley Quinn flipped the tables on the naive Lex. It is in this movie that we can see why the Joker and Harley Quinn are Batman's most dangerous enemies. The minds of most criminals follow a pattern and they hope to gain something. Usually they will not bother with criminal activity that digresses from their goal. The Joker and Harley Quinn DO NOT follow this pattern. Any kind of chaos gives them joy, and they do not have to gain anything to win. Their total revenge on the helpless Lex shows us just how dangerous the Joker and Harley Quinn are. What is even more frightening is that throughout this movie, it is so easy to cheer for the Joker and Harley Quinn every step of the way. In all honesty this movie never drags. So we have a great story, super heroes that display heroic benevolence as well as human weaknesses, and a tour of psychotic terror by the Joker and Harley Quinn.

That's why it always pains me to sit through the  first two thirds which don't have much to recommended them. I do love the darkly effective synth score, and the opening in New York waters rocks, but much of the time is spent focusing on uninteresting characters, and therefore the film barely holds my interest. For every great shot of a Zombie emerging from the earth(love that one p.o.v. shot from a Zombie's eyes as it rises, dirt spilling away from it's view) there are several minutes spent with unattractive, uninteresting characters discussing things. It's not too much to ask that a low-budget exploitive Zombie-thriller have more than just sadistic gore scenes to recommended it(that eye/splinter scene still makes me wince). 'Night of the Living Dead' and 'Let Sleeping Corpses Lie' both have fleshed-out(sorry) characters to care about and root for, and Z-grade entries like 'Zombie Holocaust' and 'Nightmare City' are more even in their pacing. I guess I'm a little demanding when it comes to Zombie thrillers as I find them to be some of the most entertaining and comic-book-like in the Horror family tree, and I just think that Fulci's 'ZOMBIE' could have and should have been better.",Zombie VHS

15005,"I hope I can write this review to recommend &quot;The Thirteenth Floor&quot; without giving the story away completely.Movies about alternate time tracks and realities have strangely become quite popular in the past couple of years, though science fiction writers have written about parallel worlds since at least the 1930's. I once wrote a term paper for a science fiction class on this subject and enjoyed the reading immensely! My favorite author in this genre was the late Phillip K. Dick. Two of his novels about parallel worlds were  &quot;The Man In The High Castle Castle&quot; and &quot;Ubik.&quot; Ironically Dick achieved some overdue fame as he was dying in 1982 when Hollywood released the well-done &quot;Blade Runner,&quot; based on one of his future-world novels.Developments in 20th century science have proven that time is in a sense an illusion, which parallels Eastern mysticism quite well. It is proveable that also in a sense events in the past, present, and future are going on at the same time. The fine, highly readable book, &quot;Parallel Universes,&quot; by Fred Alan Wolf, uses quantum physics to prove that in fact the future influences the present. While I feel that we should stay grounded in our present reality, it's also good for mind expansion to ponder the illusions of life. &quot;The Thirteenth Floor&quot; is the best movie I've seen that shows that time is an illusion, and offers questions and metaphors for various mysteries of existence, such as time, and &quot;who am I.&quot;&quot;The Thirteenth Floor&quot; is ostensibly about a company that uses computers to travel to the past, to a simulated alternate reality, where the main characters play roles similar or different to their roles in what the movie portrays as &quot;present&quot; time. The computer program that creates the alternate world actually downloads the personality of the character in present time to the past reality, and there is a strange merger of personalities, the inner world of the human, vs. the outer world he lives in.Unfortunately there is a certain amount of violence in TTF, and in fact the murder of one of the scientists who created the world-generating computers is ostensibly the &quot;real&quot; mystery that drives the action. Yet from the beginning the mysteries of what is the &quot;real&quot; world, who are the &quot;real&quot; characters, combined with appropriate music and darkness in every scene until the last one, create many levels of mystery and intrigue. As the truth of what is really going on, which is the &quot;real&quot; world, is revealed to the protagonists, the illusion of what we think of as reality actually deepens! Again, I saw this realization of the illusion of reality to be an excellent metaphor for what is called &quot;maya&quot; in Eastern mysticism. The fact that computers (science) are the reality-generators is ironic to say the least!Unlike &quot;The Matrix,&quot; which features a very dreary &quot;real&quot; world behind the more pleasant reality we live in, &quot;The Thirteenth Floor&quot; ends in a message of hope, as the &quot;real&quot; reality turns out to be a very positive future.I've read some reviews about the poor acting in the movie, and I strongly beg to differ. The 4 or 5 main actors do an outstanding job with a very abstract script. Except for the police detective all the main characters play different roles/aspects of the same character very well. I also became a (big) fan of the beautiful Gretchen Mol, whom I had never seen in a movie previously.",N/A

There are no major ethnic characters on the show.  The majority of the QAF mainstays are young, very attractive and somewhat affluent.  They live in a fantasy gay world where only the beautiful young men come to dance in a disco with a backroom (and this in Pittsburgh of all places!) You will never find transgendered characters, bears, people with disabilities or the gay everyman on this show.  AIDS is acknowledged in Michael's Uncle who is mostly a sad, old queen who makes intimations about his mortality.

The only reason I do give film 3 stars is due to incredible special effects, which involved a lot of computer tech. The writing is not there and acting is lukewarm. There is also too much emphasis on love story which makes this seem very Titanicesqe!  A good World War II epic, such as the Longest Day or Saving Pvt. Ryan does not need all that time wasted on some silly love triangle. The romance in the movie focuses the audiences attention on just that, and I came away feeling shortchanged because this was supposed to be about Pearl Harbor, and not about 3 knuckleheads and their love triangle.

485772,"&quot;Hellraiser&quot; still stands out as one of the most intruguing, visually morbid, and utterly dark horror films I've seen. I was not particularly scared but more so astonished by the visuals I was seeing: Hooks piercing flesh, bodies writhing out of floorboards from the taste of blood, eroticism and desire as a catalyst for horror, a man with nails banged into his head. I still believe these images and themes are what gives (at least the first movie) its lasting appeal. &quot;Hellraiser&quot; is centered around a box described in Clive Barker's novel &quot;The Hellbound Heart&quot; as the Lament Configuration. By solving the puzzle of this box, one opens up a world of pleasure and pain. A man named Frank who solved the secrets of the box is torn apart but is gorily ressurected by the blood of his brother Larry. Driven by desire, Frank's former lover and Larry's wife Julia helps Frank literally put the skin back on his bones. It isn't long before beings known as Cenobites come searching for Frank while Larry's daughter Kirsty becomes inadvertently involved in the mayhem. The special edition of this DVD includes a great audio commentary by Barker and star Ashley Laurence as well as a making-of documentary. &quot;Hellbound: Hellraiser II&quot; is an uneven, ambitious, but overall not-so-satisfying film also included in this set. Hours after the events that concluded the original &quot;Hellraiser,&quot; Kirsty finds herself in a hospital run by a doctor obsessed with the occult. This eventually leads to the Lament Configuration, a journey into hell, and a look into who the Cenobites were. Not as good as the original but still relatively entertaining, &quot;Hellbound&quot; does contain one particularly disturbing and infamous scene involving a crazed man and a shaving razor. &quot;Hellbound&quot; comes with similar extras as &quot;Hellraiser&quot; (commentary with director Tony Randel, writer Peter Atkins, and star Ashley Laurence; documentary, etc.). My one complaint of the set is the cumbersome packaging which consists of a large tin box, something that Anchor Bay has done with other DVD special editions like Fulci's &quot;The Beyond&quot;. I cannot say what compelled Anchor Bay to do this, but I think the large tin box is more a burden than a treasure. It is numbered, however, which is nice.

534727,"When I first learned that Tom Hanks was making a movie called Castaway I thought &quot;Oh no not another Robinson Crusoe ripoff&quot;  I was wrong.  This is one of the best films I have ever seen in my life.  Tom Hanks is a fantastic Actor who pushes his acting talent to the very limit and beyond.  Its too bad he didint win best actor at the academy awards.  The film itself is excelent.  At first you are treated to Tom fussing about in Russia, eating a gigantic dinner and getting a birthday gift.  All the wile you are waiting for the fantastic Island sequences.  Well trust me its worth it.  The plane crash sequence is the most realistic and frightining crash I have ever seen.  The rest of the film is excellent.  I could go on blabbering about the island, toms acting but a few things stand out above the rest.  The music (All 10 minutes of it) is very good but made me wish for more.  Wilson the vollyball is one of the finest actors hollywood has ever seen.  He has solid acting, a great expression and a great guy all around.  He should have won best supporting actor at the academy awards.  However I should point out this movies 2 flaws.  The first is that some sequences are too scary or too grusome for anyone under 14, heck Im 14 and I had trouble ingesting this stuff.  Tom getting scrapped against the coral, Tom getting a really big splinter in his hand in graphic detail, and (Shudder) the skating shoe in the mouth moment is one of the most painfull scenes I have ever had to watch.  The ending is a big letdown and dissapointing.  But both of those dont flaw this other wise masterpiece movie.The Good: Tom Hanks acting is superb.  Wilson the Vollyball is a great supporting actor.  Lots of funny moments, very exciting and well done movie.The Bad: Some sequences are grusome and hard to watch, what happens to Wilson is really really sad.  Only 10 minutes of music?

526892,"Shanghai Noon is by far the best Jackie Chan movie made in the US.  It is much more enjoyable than the over-rated Rush Hour.  For me a large part of that is because I find Owen Wilson to be much more entertaining and amiable than the grating human cartoon, Chris Tucker.  But even more than Tucker, the fight scenes are much closer to his Hong Kong films.  Close but still not quite there.  The action has all of Jackie's trademark acrobatics and fast editing.  It seems to be slowed down a bit from Rumble In The Bronx, Supercop or any of his other HK films though.There is a great deal of chemistry between Jackie and Owen and a lot of that has to do with Jackie's Mr Nice Guy persona.  You can't help but feel he's everybody's friend.  The relationship of the two characters reminded me a lot of the Robert DeNiro/Charles Grodin relationship in Midnight Run.  Owen Wilson is the footloose rouge trying to get the stiff uptight Chan to relax and take life as it comes.  This is a fun buddy film that I would highly recommend.",Shanghai Noon

The actors are all kids and they play baseball...and it's SO SIMPLE.One of those little films that walked quietly into theaters in 1993 and left just as quietly with little fanfare(which is probably why Fox is hesitant on releasing a DVD) happens to be one of the greatest sleepers of all-time. This movie is good, so sweetly and innocently GOOD, that you don't care if the obnoxious happens or that a main plot-point happens to be the kids retrieving a prize/signed baseball(by Babe Ruth of all players) from the jaws of a dog-beast-monster-thing.No, if there was something that James Earl Jones was right about in FIELD OF DREAMS(and he's in here too as a modern-day Boo Radley), it was that baseball brings us back to the times when we were young and apathetic to the world around us. The same applies here.This film will make you forget about your problems and redirect your focus on your youth and the times you had fun with your best friends.No matter if those times were spent on a surburban street where the foul poles were really parallel phone poles on either sides of the street or you sat on the porch watching us while drinking lemonade and listening to Ray Charles, those are the good times we remember...Take a look for yourself...-- Matt",N/A

But he is bad, because the whole movie is bad so are all the actors.  The shark footage is good, but because it is literally ripped from past &quot;Shark Weeks&quot; it was really familiar.  As a final note, the last shot of a shark clearly shows a fishing line stuck in it's mouth.

Although not as interesting overall as the segment with Ronna trying to get rent money the Las Vegas trip was too reminiscent of my more youthful days and similar excursions.  Simon is absolutely hysterical whether going to a strip club or hookin' up with two girls.  And for a stupid guy like myself the chase scenes were very exciting.  You don't always need character driven material in order to be effective and Simon's crew is.  Their segment was just flat out funny and an adrenaline rush.  It was too easy to see myself and some of my real life buddies in the role of Simon and his crew.The dinner party scene was unusual to say the least but to me not all that effective and it really didn't lend itself to the cohesiveness of the film.Not a purchase but well worth viewing.,N/A

Same for Anna Paquin -- she's no woman, just a little runny-nosed girl, which is very disappointing. But then again, the story involves her earliest introduction to the X-Men organization.What does make the movie is everyone's favorite bad boy, Wolverine. Hugh Jackman steals the show in his movie debut, but what do you expect from a stage actor -- the man can act. You don't doubt him for a second. His story is very interesting too.The depiction of the X-Men school is great. So is the depiction of Magneto, Sabretooth, and did I mention Wolverine? He's the MAN.

571853,"I really dont care that 'You can count on me' was voted the Best Picture at Sundance in 2000. That honor, to me at least, was most deserved by Jon Shear's 'Urbania', and though it never won, it at least whipped up an audience and stirred commentary from various quarters, and any film that can do that is truly revolutionary.To say that 'Urbania' is gay-friendly would be naive. While this is predominantly a movie that deals with homophobia and the universal issue of acceptance and lack of, it becomes some sort of poster-boy for the neccessity of tolerance in our lives. It also goes on to show us that the greatest films are the ones least talked about. After I saw this movie, I was amazed at just how little attention it had received. Perhaps people aren't ready for such in-your-face storytelling. But I was, and have benefitted immensely in my personal life, from the lessons this film teaches us. 'Urbania' is one long lesson in enlightenment.The story is fairly simple. It starts off with our hero, as a sad wandering twenty-something searching for his special someone on the streets of New York, the city of the Urban Legend. Jon Shear goes on to show us that NYC really is the home of the tragic folk tale come true, and then proceeds to introduce us to the fact that the hero is gay. This comes not so much as a surprise as a casual unfolding of the story and fits in very nicely. However, the object of his obsession at the moment appears to be a straight man that most people would keep away from. Why the main character follows this man forms the rest of the tale, and I can't really give away more without revealing the ending and the mysteries between.Lets just say that this is a film with a shock at every turn. And not just for effect either. It has heart, and Charlie Futterman as our hero is anything but. I haven't seen such a powerful performance in ages. But the real star of the film is the director and his message. Jon Shear has the most interesting film-making style. I could compare him to Lars Von Trier, but Shear is more choppy and unrestrained in the use of the camera. He does have a lot of heart, though, and this shows, both in the intelligent script and in the amazing performances he extracts from his lead cast, including a spellbinding one from Matthew Keeslar.I have no idea where 'Urbania' will figure in the history of gay and lesbian cinema. But I can say that there has been no other film that has dealt with homophobia and bashing in such intelligent tones. This is not an easy work of cinema, but it must be seen. Its a pity that many audiences missed out on it when it was first released in theatres around the United States. I would therefore highly recommend the purchase of this item on DVD.And spread the word.",N/A
153126,"A veritable smorgasbord of all the things that make life worthwhile, including good friendship, love, food and sex, can be found in Ang Lee's ""Eat, Drink, Man, Woman,"" the story of a widower who has raised three daughters on his own, and now that they are grown is ready to move on with his life.  Chu (Sihung Lung), a celebrated chef who runs the kitchen of a huge restaurant, finds himself at an impasse however; his daughters, Jia-Jen (Kuei-Mei Yang), the eldest, a teacher, Jia-Chen (Chien-lien Wu), his second, an airline executive, and Jia-Ning (Yu-Wen Wang), the youngest, who works at a fast food restaurant, all still live with their father, and though they are adults (all in their twenties), he feels responsible for them, as they are still under his roof.  They, on the other hand, feel responsible for him; he'll soon be retired, and they fear age is catching up with him.  And it makes them each, in turn, think twice about career opportunities and any romantic entanglements that may appear on the horizon.  it's a situation they all realize is not conducive to a happy, fulfilling and fully functional family life; the love is there, but it's seasoned with frustration, and no one seems to know what to do about it.Lee has crafted and delivered a complex, involving film, laced with poignancy and humor that deals with the kinds of problems most people face during the course of their lives.  And, of course, there's the love, the many faces of which are all explored here.  Food is the metaphor; Chu sets his table with a variety of tantalizing and exotic offerings, even as the table of life is set with like fare, and once set, it is up to the individual to sample what they will.  Fittingly, it is at the dinner table that many of the meaningful events in the lives of the family members are revealed.  Working from a screenplay written by Lee, James Schamus and Hui-Ling Wang, Lee uses the intricate emotional weave of the story to optimum effect with his ability to illuminate the sensibilities of his characters, and that he does it so well demonstrates the depth of his own insight into human nature.  And that he can so proficiently transfer the emotions of the written page to the screen demonstrates his mastery of the art of film directing.  As he proves with this film (as with films like ""The Ice Storm"" and ""Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon""), he is simply one of the best directors in the business.Lee's unique touch is also felt in the performances he exacts from his actors, a number of which are outstanding in this film, beginning with Lung, who brings Chu so credibly to life.  Wang, Wu and Yang are also exemplary in their portrayals of Chu's daughters.  To their credit-- as well as Lee's-- there's not a false moment to be found in their performances, all of which stand up to even the closest scrutiny.  These are all very real people in a very real setting, which enables the audience to identify and relate to the characters and their story, assuring that connection which makes this film such a satisfying experience.The supporting cast includes Sylvia Chang (Jin-Rong), Winston Chao (Li Kai), Chao-jung Chen (Guo Lun), Lester Chit-Man Chan (Raymond), Yu Chen (Rachel), Jui Wang (Old Wen) and Ah Lei Gua (Madame Ling).  As with real life, ""Eat, Drink, Man, Woman"" is far from predictable, and is filled with twists and turns, including a surprise at the end that equals anything M. Night Shyamalan could come up with.  In the final analysis, this film is a delightful, entertaining reflection upon the human condition that will awaken your taste buds and prepare you for the feast of life.  And, like life, it is there for the taking; grab it with both hands and embrace it.  By the end, you'll be glad you did.",N/A

It is appropriate to have covered the contributions of Pericles and Themistocles to ancient Athens but what we really admire about ancient Greece isn't the military glory (the Tartars and Attila the Hun could have taught them a thing or two !)___rather it is in the dramas of Sophocles &amp; Euripedes ,in the spiralling mysticism of Plato , the iridescent rationalism of Aristotle and the sublime majesty of Phidias's as manifested on the Parthenon frieze. It is in the intellectual and artistic realm that no civilisation ,before or since, can hold a candle to the ancient Greeks and the glaring deficiency of this documentary lies in giving short shrift to this aspect of the ancient Greek civilisation .I would have given it five stars but for this omission .",The Greeks: Crucible of Civilization VHS

566507,"Unlike most movies in the religous horror genre, Bless the Child manages to get the theological aspect pretty right, (even though a vision of a child as antichrist or, as in this film, a new savior, have no basis beyond &quot;The Omen&quot;). It seems to take that aspect seriously, and so much the better.There is a good story here, well told for the most part. Things generally remains subdued yet manages to create some creepy moments. The cast is strong. Kim Basinger seems to have a great connection with Holliston Coleman, who plays little Cody. Rufus Sewell makes a smart and compelling villian. And Jimmy Smits makes a good showing here to. The visual side of Bless the Child is workman like, but certainly thoughtful and professional. And the effects, though obvious, are certainly effective.Despite these good marks, there are quite a few questionable ones. Just as the acting is good, it's also uninspired. There doesn't seem to be a high level of passion among anyone involved. And there are quite a few side characters, namely Christina Ricci, who are meakly realized. Some of the horror elements divert from the films tone as well. I'm always up for some gore, but it needs to be well utilized. There are some scenes here that seem outright goofy in relation to the rest of the movie, if not just a little illogical. The end is also something of a let down. It's not bad but it does seem a little shallow. I just felt there should have been a little something more.Still, I must recommend Bless the Child. Though there are faults, director Chuck Russell obviously took this film very seriously. It's a tale told with care. That always shows.Even if the absolute glee that some of the classics in this genre exhibit, isn't apparent here.",Bless the Child

517792,"I had this running argument with a pal of mine about GenX'er Alex Garland's novel  *The Beach* -- he liked it, I didn't.  After seeing the movie based on the film, I'm afraid that I proved my pal wrong.  The essential silliness of the story is laid bare by the celluloid.  As is the unlikeableness of the characters, especially Richard.  As is the purploid prose, captured for those who didn't read the book by Leonardo DiCaprio's narration.  The fact that the novel received all sorts of critical acclaim only illustrates the current literary intelligentsia's penchant for knee-jerk postmodernism -- and interesting characters, to say nothing of logical narrative, be damned.I give the movie two stars because it's pretty to look at, and the actress who played Sal  (don't know her name)  turned in a fine performance, adding complexity to pretty thin role.  Thankfully, Virginie Ledoyen, who is a model in real life I think, merely has to be beautiful and is not really required to act, the script giving her virtually nothing to say.  Robert Carlisle, unfortunately, is in his Overacting Mode.  And poor Leo . . . hey, it's really not his fault, here.  What can he do with a role in which he's asked to change gears every ten minutes in the film?  Near the end, the writers have him going absolutely bonkers for no good reason.  Sal asks him to spend his days on top of a ridge, keeping his eyes peeled on unwanted new guests who have just found the beach.  For some reason, this command sends our hero careening into some heart of GenX darkness, where Life becomes a sort of apocalyptic video game.  If this isn't laughable enough, he finally ends up wearing a bandana, &quot;acting out&quot;  as the psychiatrists might say, hissing at people and such.  The writers seem to think this equates Richard with Colonel Kurtz.  Oh dear.And as for the Beach itself . . . the film fails to prove its case, namely that it's a paradise worth all the trouble of finding.  My idea of Paradise, let me vehemently state, is not hanging out with a bunch of Euros on a deserted beach, playing cricket while stoned on pot, with no air conditioning, no toothbrushes, and an occasional run for rice on the mainland.  I mean, is this anybody's paradise?  I could also have done without the cheap Thoreau philosophy, as cribbed from Cliff's Notes, i.e., when Richard makes a brief return to the mainland and is traumatized by all the people and the noise:  &quot;They're parasites, cancers, eating the entire world&quot; . . . oh pleeeze.  Did the writers come up with this, er, original insight after the third day of a meth binge?  Spare me.Not godawful, but I wouldn't waste my time, if I were you.",N/A

Republic had the writers, actors directors and, most importantly, the stuntmen who knew how to make them.

The acting stinks, and its obvious that the plot's only purpose in this movie is to loosely connect the really cool fight scenes, which are easily the most original part of the movie. Still, while the superhuman leaping and springing were a fresh look two years ago, the technique has become SO overdone in action movies lately that it no longer impresses but rather annoys.

153485,"Very loose adaption of &quot;Food of the Gods&quot;, as if HG Wells had adapted his work for one of those AIP Beach movies.  In this one, a group of cardigan wearing bad-teens led by the evil Beau Bridges descend on a California town, not knowing that the town's resident genius (known as &quot;Genius&quot; and played by Ron Howard) has developed something called goo which causes super-growth.  A couple of geese try the stuff and grow to a size slightly smaller than a BMW, amusing and amazing the town before ending up as the guests of honor at a BBQ for a town full of kids who can't spell FDA.  In a classic scene, the evil Bridges gang steals the goo and, too delinquent to just sell the stuff to the highest bidder, they eat it.  Growing to monstrous size (which is anything bigger than their clothes can stand before tearing off - a logical detail actually working for the plot for once), they take over the town and force its citizens to watch them engage in slow motion dancing (how hard did they have to fight for this town).  Led by Tommy Kirk, the good teens try to keep the bad teens at bay until Genius can create a &quot;cure&quot; for the goo.  At its worst, the flick is bald exploitation, and good clean fun at best.  Most critics slam this as an exploitative version of the Wells book - why the connection was ever made is a mystery to me.  The problem is that the producers take this stuff much to seriously - if they had Russ Meyer do it (a guy whose pretty honest of his intentions) it would have been a big cult hit.",N/A

And also, inserted a lot of psychology. What is fantasy today could be our future!I rate my movies in the following manner: Believeability of the script and acting. Interesting subject matter. And how well each acter is introduced in a way we know the nature of the character. In many movies, I require at least one good nude scene of the female character to add to the introduction.(Of course this is not the case in all the movies I like) However it is always a plus point.When I have seen the movie, do I still think about it several days later with positive thoughts? Would I go to see it again?All the movies I have rated so far meet this criteria.",Close Encounters of the Third Kind VHS

183282,"From the studio that brought you Totoro and Kiki's Delivery Service, comes one of the best animated drama I've ever seen. THe movie takes place at a time of war where bombers make random sweeps on Japan. Seita, a teenage boy, is involved in this. His father is in the Navy, his mother died after a bombing and he has to take care of his sister. They then go to stay with a friend of theirs. They manage to sell some stuff to get money to buy food, which at the time is scarce. The two eventually get tired of living with the strict woman and leave to make they're own home in a cave. But Seita's little sister gets sick. He does all he can to help her feel better, but nothing works and she soon dies. Seeing the little flashbacks of her playing near the cave with classic music playing is enough to make anyone cry. After Seita heres his father died at sea, he is the only one of his family left. He incinerates his sister body and soon he too dies. This is one of those movies to make you cry. The plot is that of how life would treat you. It's no wonder this movie got awards. There are some nice scenes in the movie with Seita playing with his sister. And its those little things which make the tragedy of death even greater. If a movie can do this, I think it deserves awards. A must-see to anyone who loves to see movies of war and of drama.",N/A

455692,"This is Neil LaBute's more lavish but no less vitriolic follow-up to &quot;In the Company of Men&quot;.  Whereas that film had a documentary sense of realism to it, this one feels very much like a play.  Although nothing mystical happens, there's a sense of surreality that coats this film.  From the opening music, an oddly appealing version of Metallica's &quot;Enter Sandman&quot; played on four cellos by a quartet called Apocalyptica, to the main titles, which are superimposed over a sedate Alex Katz print called &quot;The Cocktail Party&quot;, we enter a world of wealth and culture.  Only under the glossy surface beats a soulless heart.Witness an early dinner scene.  Two couples meet at one's swanky townhouse, exchange pleasantries and share glasses of wine.  The women are smartly dressed.  The men are too (one of them laments a spill on his new doeskin jacket).  But they never connect in a tangible way.  Until, that is, an offer of infidelity is confidentially proffered.  The movie uses this moment to jump off into a world where everyone (but one) appears stable but all are ineffectual and socially retarded.  This point is further driven home by a series of scenes set in an art gallery, where each character uses the same verbatim small talk with an artist's assistant to expose significant aspects of their character.  They're artificial moments, but delicately set up the tone of the film.  The cast is uniformly excellent, if not overly mannered, which further helps create the feeling that you're watching a play rather than a film.  Ben Stiller's character represents this the best, not just because he's a drama professor.  He is erudite and articulate when &quot;performing&quot;, such as when lecturing his students, or giving a tour of a museum.  But when he gets into social situations, Stiller fails to complete a single one of his thoughts.  Most of his sentences trail off, ending with the question &quot;You know?&quot; or just a resigned sigh.  It's an evocative (if a touch shallow) character trait, but damn if it doesn't get annoying by film's end.  I had this intense desire to slap Ben good.Aaron Eckhart sports a $2 haircut, a cheesy moustache, and a bulging gut.  He's playing a character exactly opposite to his toxic Chad from &quot;In the Company of Men&quot;, and it's amazing that one man can pull off both roles.  Eckhart has proven himself to be a marvelous chameleon-like actor, easily filling out the pathetic and needy sap LaBute has written for him here.Jason Patric gets the toxic role this time, playing a misogynistic obstetrician (he's prone to playing football with a model of a fetus).  His stories of extreme behaviour &quot;amuse&quot; his friends.  One involves sending a retributive note to an ex-girlfriend on doctor's stationary, informing her that she may be HIV-positive.  Another, in the scene that the film will be forever known for, involves high school hijinks in the gym shower with a bullied boy named Timmy.  Patric wrings every bit of wickedness from this story, told in one incredibly long close-up take.  It's a powerful little moment that leaves the audience (not to mention the other characters in the scene) exclaiming, &quot;What the heck was that?&quot;Catherine Keener, so energetic in &quot;Being John Malkovich&quot;, is much more subdued here.  But you can feel her frustration bubbling up beneath the service (she's Stiller's girlfriend, and is as fed up with him as the audience is).  Keener is a very self-aware actress, knowing when to go full throttle and when to pull back.  Hers is not the showiest role in the film, but it ranks right up there with the most memorable.Nastassja Kinski is used the least of the six main actors (author's note: Come to think of it, there are only six speaking parts in the whole movie, making the theatrical nature of the piece even more profound).  And it's probably for the best.  She is fetching, but doesn't bring much more to the role than quiet neediness.Amy Brenneman plays Eckhart's wife, and has an affair with Stiller.  She stays nervous and reticent throughout the movie, never giving in to her boredom or frustration even when the moment calls for a little blow-up.  In the beginning she passes for the innocent moral centre of the film, but by the end she is the one most corrupted.  Brenneman does well playing both sides of this coin.Writer/Director LaBute appears to have learned much since &quot;Men&quot;.  He's more confident using close-ups to get in his characters' faces.  And the film looks luscious bathed in warm autumnal hues.  The story, such as it is, is told through a series of vignettes, each tellingly juxtaposed with the next to subtly portray the differences between men and women.  A scene of three women talking about sex over lunch is followed by one of three men in a steam room pondering the same subject, in a cruder manner.  And though there is no real narrative thrust, the individual scenes themselves are propulsive enough to keep the viewer interested.",Your Friends & Neighbors VHS

To what extent are our lives ruled by chance, and to what extent are our fates determined by personality?

The humor we normally get in a Tenchi flick just isn't here to support this.I understand that the director and screen writers were going for a serious, and meaningful anime movie, and I don't have a problem with that, and to any Tenchi fan - you will need to see this at least once. Maybe not own it, but definitely see it. The story DOES get moving towards the last part, and surprise surprise for a Tenchi story, the plot line does have closure.

It seems at times that screenwriter Peter Stone was trying to out-Hitchcock Hitchcock with the endless plot twists, but unlike the trend in current cinema, each of the twists seems reasonable and believable.

Paul Muni, the great Polish actor who specialized in playing great men of history (seemingly taking the place of the elderly English stage-trained George Arliss) is terrific in his characterization of Emile Zola. It took Warners nearly a year to prepare the &quot;Zola project&quot;. The screenplay went through various re-writes and a great deal of research was done to ensure historical accuracy; the result was a showcase for the unique Mr.Muni. The picture may seem a trifle dry, stodgy and drawn-out today, but it has long been esteemed as one of the greatest historical biographies Hollywood ever put on film. Variety called it &quot;a vibrant, tense and emotional story about the man who fought a nation with his pen&quot; It has followed not merely the spirit but, to a rare degree, the very letter of his life and of the historically significant lives around him. The racial theme involving the Jewish Dreyfus is tastefully handled; not once is the word &quot;Jew&quot; mentioned.

154914,"__________________Annie Hall is one of the best films of the 1970s, in some ways it defined them. Woody outdid himself, and yet it really was just the first of his ""real"" movies. Without this one, well, never mind, I can't bear to contemplate that. This is often rated as one of the best American movies ever made. I'd like to warn you that it has no chase scenes or shootouts, no hostages get taken, no wrongly-convicted criminals try to break out of jail, and no one says ""excellent"" or high-fives. It's just a good film. If you don't have an ounce of heart or have a poor ability to remember premarital affairs, you may not like it. Otherwise you will.Manhattan - Not only one of Woody Allen's best movies, one of the best movies, period. While Annie Hall is a great movie, the development of Allen's talent between AH and Manhattan is startling. The chemistry of the cast is a factor in its success. The humor is smoothly integrated into the dialogue and not distracting. The scenes are well acted, shot, and edited. It's a love story in which the only mature participant is a 17 year old.Interiors - Not much music in the soundtrack, which contributes to the somber feel of this film. Despite some of the critical rejection of it, and despite the Bergman influence, this is one of his finest. I remember seeing this reviewed by Gene Shalit who was nearly speechless (not much of a change, since he was doing those 30 second reviews for Today back then) and in awe. The performances were natural and believable, and the cast were well chosen. This film may appear derivative, but I found it to be innovative and original, and couldn't take my eyes off it, despite the deliberate drabness.Stardust Memories is one of Woody's most underrated films, stronger than any of his ""early, funny ones"" and is very cohesive, particularly with repeated viewings. The gags have more impact because most of the movie is stress and strain. There's a jail scene (a common element in Woody's films - off the top of my head, there are at least four other movies with some form of confinement), three different breakups, and its flashbacks anticipates the recent ""Deconstructing Harry"". Stardust Memories was in part a kiss-off to critics of ""Interiors"". It's shot in black and white, has a great cast and performances, has unexplained props (like a cervical collar), Laraine Newman (first cast of SNL), Brent Spiner (Commander Data in ST:TNG), and the most graceful integration of Woody's childhood memories. This is a movie best experienced more than once -- another thing it has in common with ""Deconstructing Harry"".Love and Death is one that I've only seen once, and it didn't make much of an impact on me. A friend of mine considers this the best of Woody's funny movies, and he's the one who loaned it to me. I found it a little too gag-filled, although I must admit that I fell asleep a few times.Sleeper is a more sophisticated version of Bananas. Although it also gets preachy, it looks better on the screen, has better gags, and superficially is a great send-up of science fiction of all kinds. I love the bit about health food.Bananas is poorly shot, preachy, and not too funny, which is odd because it's one of the ""early, funny ones"". I know people who mistakenly think of this as his finest work. [...]Everything You Always Wanted to Know About Sex but Were Afraid to Ask is one of his classic funny ones, but having seen it I don't see anything much to recommend it. The gags look like things he based on his stage act that may have been daring during the Bitter End years. [...]Now that we know what is in the second Woody box, the main question to ask is ""why?"" This first box set is a far better deal, and the selections in the second box mostly mystify fans, buffs, and critics.",N/A

415838,"Never having read the book on which this is based I was not sure what to expect. This is a period piece, and Kate Winslet is beautiful and stunning here as always. However, lest you think the story will be boring, which it seems to be from its first 20 minutes, wait and see the development of the plot. A young man, Jude Fawley, studies all the time. He wants to go to college, but he falls into lust with a young woman (Rachel Griffiths) and she claims to be pregnant. He marries her and defers his dreams of going to college. She eventually runs off and leaves a letter stating that she was never pregnant. You think this is the last you will see of her, but it isn't. It never is in cases such as these. Jude goes off to college and there is meets Sue. Winslet as Sue is a bright, witty, intelligent and unconventional woman who will not bend to the conventions of society or of the church. Her cousin, Jude, is quite a scholar and falls in love with Sue even before he realises she is his cousin. Eventually they fall in love with each other despite the fact that they know it is wrong to be in love with one's own cousin. Winslet bears two children with Jude, and sometime during all of this, Griffiths returns and gives Jude custody of the child she did indeed bear him. The family is poor but seemingly happy, and they travel around to keep people from finding out their secret (having children out of wedlock with one's own cousin is not looked upon fondly). However, just when things seem to be changing economically, the child Jude had with Griffiths murders the other two children and then hangs himself. Sue turns on Jude and leaves him, spending her life almost exclusively in church, suddenly changing her entire belief system. It is a sad, gripping, and heartbreaking story. Very unpleasant, but the acting, scenery and the believability is all there.",Jude VHS

279511,"Dickens, with his vast humanity and that amazing vitality of his which created a whole world of characters, contains inexhaustable riches for the screen, though his long rambling plots are the despair of scenerio writers.  His people--types, caricatures, or whatever you choose to call them--are distict and individual in appearance, actions and speech--and are rare parts for good actors.  The trick in getting Dickens effectively on the screen was an enormously difficult one of selecting and condensing--keeping enough to satisfy the Dickens lover who complains bitterly when any favourite character or episode is left out.  Some may find Dickens as being overlong, overly sentimental and often more than a bit tedious; at any rate, however, this is excellent Dickens!  Good intentions and imposing ambitions are plentiful enough in the making of movies, but woefully rare are the instances where technical excellence, good taste and judgement and an intelligent sense of the rightness of things combined to bring thowe intentions and ambitions to a successful issue.  DAVID COPPERFIELD is one of those rare and happy successes.  It met every reasonable expectation competently and generously, and the film was highly praised by the critics and public alike back in 1935.  This filmed version of the classic novel by Dickens, is remarkably faithful to the source - rich in atmosphere and fine characterisations.  David himself is played ideally by both Freddie Bartholomew and Frank Lawton; they miraculously seem to be the same person at different ages!  If Frank Lawton seems less interesting, its only because his adventures are so mild compared  with those of Bartholomew.  W.C. Fields' whole career seemed to have been a preparation for his role as Micawber; he is magnificent in his off-beat role.  Edna May Oliver and Jessie Ralph give flawless pictures of Betsey Trotwood and Peggotty.  The black villainy of the Murstones is done in just the right spirit by Basil Rathbone and Violet Kembell Cooper while Roland Young makes you actually feel the dampness of Uriah Heap's hands!  The film is a splendid picture-book of the novel, custom made for those who admire the splendid novel by Dickens.",David Copperfield VHS
382059,"For starters: This was a play before it was a film. Both came out of Austrailia where both are set. The play is brilliant (I directed a community theatre version several years back) and the movie remains very true to the play.If I had to make a comparison, it would be to Steel Magnolias - and that's not really fair to either play/film. My comparison is not so much on the content as it is to the theme and the way it plays out during the course of each. The first act (and yes, films can have acts) sets up the characters for the audience. It allows us to get to know these people. This is an effective mechanism if the characters have any substance and bear getting to know. It is also the act where the humor is rapid fire (think the dialogue in Truvy's hair salon). In The Sum of Us, the first act is filled with heartwarming knowledge and second hand stories that will have you laughing yourself sick.The second act (most plays today only have two) is tragedy lightly peppered with humor (the graveyard scene after Shelby's death - and here the grocery store after the father's stroke).There is not a single bad performance by any actor in this film. In fact, it's full of top notch Austrailian actors of both stage and screen. It was this film that introduced me to Russell Crowe (who would go on to win an Oscar for Gladiator and deliver wowing performances in L.A. Confidential and others).Russell Crowe as the gay son who has no luck in the romance department has a very cool father who, while he would prefer his son were straight, knows that what he really wants is his son to be happy. His father, in fact, constantly tries to push his son into a relationship with one or another of his dates. This has varying hilarious results. (In a second hand story we are told that the father interrupted the son and a date while they were &quot;coupling&quot;. The response to the son from the father upon seeing this: &quot;Mind the sheets.&quot;).I've already given too much away, although this isn't a film to be watched for surprise, but rather an elegant and eloquent character study that shows us that love and patience can truly conquer all.",The Sum of Us VHS

396882,"Paul Gallico's charming little story &quot;Thomasina&quot; is turned into an equally lovely little Disney film from 1964 directed by Don Chaffey (&quot;Greyfriars Bobby&quot;).  Veterinarian Andrew MacDhui (Patrick McGoohan) is a widower who is raising his young daughter Mary (Karen Dotrice) in Scotland in 1912.  Andrew has no empathy for the townsfolk who love their pets and when Mary's beloved cat Thomasina is injured he quickly decides the animal should be killed.  Mary is distraught and Andrew simply cannot understand why the logic of the situation is not clear to the girl.  Mary and her friends prepare an elaborate funeral for Thomasina, at which point Lori MacGregor (Susan Hampshire) shows up.  The children think she is a witch, but in truth she lives in the woods and nurses injured animals back to health using love and common sense.  Lori recognizes the cat is not dead and takes it home to help it recover, during which time Thomasina goes to Cat Heaven in a marvelously fanciful sequence.  Andrew has a bad reputation with the locals because he killed his daughter's cat and they start taking their pets to Lori.  Andrew finally goes to see her and is not so busy being impressed by her healing skills that he fails to fall in love with her.  But then Mary sees Thomasina walking outside her house and chases after her in a driving storm and ends up catching pneumonia.  The doctors hold out no hope to the frantic Andrew, and Lori tells him that only he can help Mary recover using the power of love.Lots of Disney movies have a cold-hearted adult transformed into a human being, and &quot;The Three Lives of Thomasina&quot; is one of the best of this type of film, even better than &quot;Pollyanna. &quot;  This is mainly because it has the virtue of a first-rate cast, from McGoohan, Hampshire and Dotrice as the three principles to Finlay Currie and Laurence Naismith standing out in the supporting cast.  Elspeth March supplies the voice of Thomasina, who gets to comment on the action from time to time, and Matthew Garber, who went on with Dotrice to play the kids in &quot;Mary Poppins,&quot; also has a small role.  But at the heart of this film is Paul Gallico's endearing fable.  I think this is just a nice little film and I am not even a cat person.",N/A
574990,"This season is, to me, one of the best ones for the X-Files.  There are so many good episodes, it's hard to know where to begin.  I guess the beginning.The Blessing Way / Paperclip is the best season-opening story in the history of the show, IMO.  It's non-stop action and revelation, tinged with a bit of mysticism as well.  The stand-off between Skinner and Scully at the end of Blessing Way  is not to be missed, along with the exchanges between CSM and Skinner.It continues on with other winners, Clyde Bruckman's Final Repose, Jose Chung's From Outer Space (both by the incomparable Darin Morgan), Oubliette, Revelations.  My favourite of the conspiracy eps, though, is Wetwired.  I've seen it many times since I bought this DVD, and it never fails to thrill.  The descent of Scully into mania, Mulder's determination to know the truth, save his friend, and unmask what's really going on, it's all here.  All of the episodes (with the exception of the really terrible Teso Dos Bichos) have at least something to offer, even if they're not the best.I've talked a lot about the season itself, but how are the discs?  The picture quality is really good, the extras are interesting, but there's one thing that brings this set a step above the first two seasons (other than the season itself being the best).  Commentaries!!!!!Yes, the X-Files people have finally decided to include audio commentaries of a couple of episodes.  I didn't realize what I was missing until I watched Jose Chung's From Outer Space with the commentary track on.  Darin Morgan is a god, and Rob Bowman plays well off of him.  I loved hearing the behind the scenes details of why this happened, what Darin was trying to say when that happened, etc.The commentary for Apocrypha is also very interesting, though I find Chris Carter's voice a little annoying.  Still, he is the main X-Files guy, and it was interesting.  Being from Vancouver, I found Carter's insights about shooting up here were worth the price of admission by themselves.Buy this DVD set now.  Buy the first two if you can, but definitely buy this one.  Then, in November, buy Season 4, which is the second best season.  Then prepare to be entertained for a long, long time.",The X-Files - The Complete Third Season
573188,"There are very few people who I would bestow the title of &quot;genius&quot; upon. Leji Matsumoto is definitley one of them. Since the 1970's he has created some of the most memorable characters and brought to the screen ( both in film and television) epic tales of good versus evil.The Harlock Saga is another fine example of the enduring legacy of this anime icon. Set well within the Harlock Universe, The Harlock Saga is an epic &quot;space opera&quot; set against the backdrop of Richard Wagner's score for the &quot;Ring Series&quot;. The booming music along with the crisp DVD audio really make me wish I had watched this first in a home theater setting. The tiny stereo speakers on my television really did not do this DVD the justice that it deserved.Though some may have complained that the animation in this series wasn't very good I beg to differ. Having been familiar with much of Matsumoto's previous work, I can say the animation exhibits a retro quality while still maintaining a modern feel at the same time. A feat that must have been quite difficult but Bandai Visual seems to have pulled it off nicely. Though I did not like the Arcadia rendered in CGI, it was only done so in one episode.The one problem I can see with this DVD is not so much the story but that the Matsumoto Universe is almost &quot;too enormous&quot; for just one series. I've heard other reviewers complain that they didn't understand many elements of the plot and that they were unfamiliar with many of the characters. There does seem to be a bias toward the more knowledgable Matsumotophile. And at the same time this story doesn't not seem to fit anywhere in the Captain Harlock timeline. This DVD has to be considered a &quot;side story&quot;. Possibley one of the many adventures that Harlock and the gang had in their travels. (Note: The Harlock timeline itself is wrought with many inconsistencies.)For the unitiated, it might be better to choose Galaxy Express 999 as a starting point for you Matsumoto viewing. Many of the characters from The Harlock Saga turn up in both Galaxy Express 999 and Adieu Galaxy Express 999. Many of the questions asked may very well be answered in these two films. The &quot;definitive&quot; origin of Captain Harlock is told in the film &quot; My Youth In Arcadia&quot;, which has yet to be release on DVD as of yet. This film is literally the starting point for the Captain Harlock and his crew. As I said before the Harlock Universe is so vast it does tend to get a bit confusing at times.As for the bonuses on this DVD, there is not shortage of them. Everything from English voice cast interviews to title free credit sequences and even DVD-ROM features. All the stops were pulled out for this edition.All in all I'd have to recomend this DVD. If you love adventure on a grand scale, the climb aboard the Arcadia and set sail on the sea of stars with Captain Harlock!!",N/A

321928,"Having owned the VHS tape of PIPPIN for quite a few years, I was excited to see that this DVD version included eight more minutes than was on my videotape. Parts of &quot;War Is a Science&quot; were put back in, totally missing from the tape version. The song (as well as the show) is still incomplete on this version, but it's likely the most complete issue of this ground-breaking show we'll ever see.Performance wise, you couldn't ask for more from Ben Vareen, William Katt, and Chita Rivera, all of whom give exciting performances captured here for all-time. Christopher Chadman, who plays the egotistical Lewis, brother of Pippin, went on to have a successful career as a Broadway choreographer before his untimely death. And it's great to see Martha Raye playing a role on stage since most of our memories of her are from dated 1940's movies that emphasize her brashness and not her humanity.The most disappointing aspect of this DVD was its sound quality. The &quot;surround&quot; sound as digitized through my receiver muffled the singing and emphasized the orchestra. I found that sending the sound through the side speakers made the singing much clearer and less problematic.The interview with Bob Fosse by critic/video producer David Sheehan isn't long on substance, but it's great to see this theater and film icon again in interviews not seen before.All-in-all, PIPPIN is a sound DVD investment.",Pippin VHS
197341,"I still cannot believe how many people do not know that this movie exists. I wonder if this film would have ever been released if it was not for the current trend in cult releases on DVD and tape. It may not be the best movie ever made, but it is definitely one of the best fantasy films of modern cinema.Sure, maybe some of the effects may be dated by today's standards or the film may have been marketed for children, but ... who cares? The work on the design of this production alone should have won it several awards, David Bowie's performance still stands out as incredible, and the story itself is a lot deeper than most will admit. But hey, at least that fact has not hurt the film's popularity. Only something as well done as this could withstand the tests of time in a film industry like ours.Regardless of anyone who might disagree as to how good or bad Labyrinth is, no one can deny it's power to generate a fan base that could survive without any means to purchase a copy for so long. Only something that can touch people's hearts and minds could do something like that. The eighties heralded so many well done fantasy productions that I wish it would become a filmmaking trend again someday.Labyrinth, The Never Ending Story, The Princess Bride, Return to Oz, and Legend were truly some of the most painstakingly detailed, amazingly directed, and beautifully scored films that I can think of. I may have originally viewed them as a young child, but over the years not one of them has disappeared from my memories. As one grows older one forgets the unmemorable, but not works of art like these. After just viewing Labyrinth again, I can see that even though I've grown and I've learned many things about filmmaking itself, this movie still amazes me. Even if some have a problem with the pace or are avid haters of muppets, they should sit down and give this film a chance. At times it almost seems as if the characters in the film are just walking through a wonderfully done canvas of colors, and I am not talking about the matte paintings.There are points where the viewer just forgets that they are even viewing a film and become mesmerized by the music, visuals, and feel of Labyrinth. One might think that Bowie's music, having been a fad of the eighties, would have also been awkward after a decade or so, but that is not the case either. The music just seems to fit as if it were never part of the real world at all but just more of what one would expect from mischievous goblins out to have fun or Jareth's attempts at wooing the heroine.If I had to pick one thing about this film that will truly leave anyone in awe, it is the ballroom sequence. I have not seen many films in my life that have given a feel of a hypnotizing dream like Frank Oz and Jim Henson did in that scene. The symbolism equally matched with a romanticized score, perfectly timed dance choreography and unbelievable costume designing make for one of the grandest scenes I have ever viewed.I'm very happy that now after more than a decade, this film has been restored and given a chance at new life. Maybe now more will learn of it and give it the appreciation it deserves.",N/A
564954,"I love anything from the &quot;Living Arts&quot; series, and I have a pretty good collection of yoga tapes from &quot;Living Arts&quot; as well. I ordered this tape because I read that pilates is a cross between yoga, aerobics and ballet, and I thought, &quot;Why not give it a go?&quot;Ana Caban is pretty lively, enthusiastic, and she and her pilates partner, Tara have some pretty amazing bodies. If you're the type that doesn't want to watch a couple of models bending and stretching and looking oh-so adorable, then I really wouldn't reccomend this tape. For those of us who don't particularly care about these things, Ana is a little bit on the cutsie side, but she doesn't come off as an air-head, which, I might add, is probably the number one reason why I'll stop using an exercise tape. Over all, she has her silly moments but it's nothing I'd get annoyed with after viewing several times.She and Tara alternate between the modified and more difficult exercises. Sometimes it's hard to tell who's doing what at first, until you actually try the moves, then it becomes clear who's demonstrating the more difficult version. This can be a little misleading at first, in most exercise tapes one instructor sticks with a specific level of difficulty, and usually you just follow that one instructor until you're ready to move on, but for some reason the two women leap back and forth!The tape starts off with 10 minutes of introduction, which covers a detailed explanation of pilates terminology (it's actually quite simple), how to hold various positions to prevent injury, and how to breathe. She's very clear on the instructions, and even offers demos so it's pretty difficult to screw up. She even goes into the principles of pilates, and tells you a little bit of what it does and why. You don't need to watch this part every time you work out, but it's good if you've never done this type of exercise before.The workout itself is 20 minutes long. The exercises are almost too simple, by my standards (remember, I do yoga and have also done ballet for several years, so I would guess for someone just starting out this would make a good beginners tape!). The great thing about pilates is that there is minimal stress on your joints, so if you have joint problems this tape is definitely for you! I did find two or three of the exercises to be pretty nasty on the tailbone. There are no modifications for those of us with sensitive tailbones, but I've found that a pillow under my butt works great, with little (if any) difference in the workout.Although pilates is sort of seen as a kind of &quot;fad&quot; workout, I really would recommend this tape to older people, as it has so little stress on the joints (great if you have menopause-related joint problems, or minor arthritis, for example), women who want to get in shape after a pregnancy (the focus is on the &quot;powerhouse&quot; - abs, lower back and butt!), anyone just starting an exercise routine (only 20 minutes ... it'll keep you motivated and it won't burn you out!), or athletes recovering from an injury. It's not the fast paced, jump-up-and-stress-your-joints-for-90-minutes nonsense that causes most of us to go into cardiac arrest. Don't let that mislead you though, you'll work up a sweat!Over all, it's a great tape. I use it whenever I'm too lazy to do a serious workout, or if I just want to exercise really quick. I plan to keep it as I'm still new to pilates and can really see why this type of exercise has caught on so quickly in health clubs and such. It's alot of fun and the results are pretty quick too. Even if you think maybe this beginners tape might not challnge you enough give it a go, it'll introduce you to the terminology, and get you aquainted with the seemingly akward poses (it's these bizarre little positions that actually do the most for you!). Just watch out for that tailbone!",N/A

536380,"Bridget Jones Diary evolved from a newspaper column, became a book and then almost simultaneously became a film and a second book.  While Helen Fielding locked herself in an LA hotel room penning 'The Edge of Reason', accomplished screenwriters Richard Curtis (of NOTTING HILL and BLACKADDER fame) and Andrew Davies (PRIDE AND PREJUDICE, VERY PECULIAR PRACTICE etc) hacked about at the first Bridget Jones novel to create the screenplay for this movie.  Fielding had no track record on screenplays, so it was understandable that an experienced professional should be drafted in.  But two??  The end result is something reasonably satisfying, but as a romance it's not as convincing as say, NOTTING HILL, and as a comedy, it's not as funny as FOUR WEDDINGS.  There just aren't enough top-quality jokes spread about the movie -- the writers don't make the most of Bridget's two opportunities to deliver really bad speeches, for example.  I get the sense that if Richard Curtis had been given total authorial control over the screenplay, he would have put more effort into it.This DVD goes nowhere to explain the resentment Fielding felt about having the two screenwriters brought in.  She is tight-lipped in the interview on the DVD, but the questioning is undemanding.  Fielding has deliberately set the screenwriters an insoluble task for THE EDGE OF REASON, because in that book Bridget Jones goes to Italy to interview Colin Firth as Colin Firth.As for the other extras on the DVD, it's clear that the editor did a good job: the right deleted scenes were left out of the movie, even if one or two contained a greater sense of the diary feel of the original book.When I originally saw this at the cinema, the audience, who seemed to be 90% female, enjoyed this enormously.  My main criticism of the plot was that Bridget doesn't provide Darcy with sufficient grounds for falling in love with her.  Bridget seems to win largely through comparison with Darcy's snooty lawyer girlfriend.  We see big leaps in the affection Darcy has for Bridget, and it would have been nice to have had a couple more scenes to smooth out those leaps.Contrary to all my expectation, Renee Zellweger gives an excellent portrayal of Bridget.  Her English accent is flawless, and she only gives her American roots away by occasionally looking too directly into her parents' eyes.I liked it.  A good movie, but not a great one.",Bridget Jones's Diary
449652,"Gone With the Wind is remember as a great movie because of it's epic scope and excellent production values.  But 60 years later when the big budget no longer thrills us, we are left with a decent film but nothing special.To begin with the entire film is very campy and melodramatic.  The whole film is very heavy-handed and over-done.  Scenes like where Scarlet crys &quot;I'll never be hungry again&quot; are just plain ackward.  Someone should have tatooed the word &quot;subtlty&quot; on Selznick's head.The script is fairly weak too.  It presents a very narrow, one dimensional view of the Civil War.  Worse, the Civil War ends half way through the movie and the rest of the film lacks the first half's energy.Another major flaw is that the characters lack any real depth.  Scarlet is cold and nasty through the whole movie.  She never changes untill the last two minutes of the movie.  There is simply no development.  Ashley is noble and his wife is so nice and sweat that it makes me sick.  These characters simply aren't human and don't feal real.  Probably the only character in the whole movie who actually developes at all is Ret.  Sadly, Clark Gable's strong performance isn't enough to carry the rest of the cast.It should also be noted that Gone With the Wind is very racist at some points.  The scene where all the slaves are going off to fight the &quot;evil yankees&quot; is enough to turns one's stomache.  Most of the black characters are portrayed as child-like and stupid.  The only exception to this is Mimi who does an excellent job and deserved her Oscar.Gone With the Wind is still an example of fine production values but when you strip away all the lavish sets and money spent on the film, you're left with a rather hollow experiance.  While there is no denying that it is a very pretty movie, even today, and it does have it's moments, Gone With the Wind is simply an over-done and campy movie.  This film does not deserve to be ranked up there with the likes of Citizen Kane or the Godfather.  It's just not that good.",N/A

563230,"I just bought this tape yesterday afternoon, and I'm still chuckling over it. I had heard about this British Comic Relief special over a year ago, but never thought it would be released in the U.S. -- first of all because Doctor Who is considered something of a cult here (i.e., there's little or no money in it), and second because most American fans of the show take it so bloody seriously, they'd probably consider &quot;Fatal Death&quot; as an affront (as witness Star Trek fans' virulent reaction to Shatner's &quot;Get a life&quot; bit on Saturday Night Live). I'm overjoyed to see I was wrong on both counts. Not only have the BBC and Warner Bros. seen a profit potential in a U.S. release, but the reaction I've seen on this page is overwhlemingly positive. As to my reaction? Well...Being a Blackadder fan as well as a Doctor Who Fan, I was delighted to see Rowan Atkinson in the title role here. He captures the Doctor's spirit perfectly -- sort of a cross between Paul McGann's look, John Pertwee's warmth and charm, and just a little bit of Pat Troughton's naughty-little-boy attitude. And what a brilliant coup, getting Jonathan Pryce to play the part of the Master! Not only is he a great actor (one of the most underrated British actors working today, and one I wish I could see more often), he is also great at playing villains (which you can see in both the Bond film Tomorrow Never Dies, and in Something Wicked This Way Comes, which has Pryce as the devilish Mr. Dark -- his confrontation with Jason Robards in this film is both chilling and electrifying). Here he gives the Master a perfect blend of Anthony Ainley's over-the-top bravado and Roger Delgado's brilliant, jovial menace -- yet Pryce puts just enough of his own not-inconsiderable talent in to make the role his own. Julia Swahala makes a creditable companion to the Doctor, though I can't quite understand why the Doctor would marry her -- she's got nice legs and everything, but they should have brought back Romana if they wanted to go that route. The other guest actors they brought in to play successive Doctor regenerations were all spot-on, from Richard E. Grant's &quot;lick-the-mirror-handsome&quot; incarnation to Hugh Grant's less-conceited-but-still-quite-handsome version. I also loved the use of Joanna Lumley at the end (&quot;Oh, it's got three settings!&quot;); it's a brilliant twist, and one can't help but wonder why they never tried it on the original series (as opposed to, say, Colin Baker).As to the humor quotient -- well, I think my review title (which I quite frankly stole from Eric Idle) pretty much describes it. There are dozens of in-jokes here, craftily designed for longtime lovers of the show and its conventions/cliches (&quot;Doctor, what's happening?&quot; &quot;I'll explain later.&quot;); there are a brilliant series of time-travel gags early on, worthy of Douglas Adams at his most intricate -- and a few (ahem) &quot;bottom-burp&quot; jokes worthy of The Young Ones at their dirtiest. There are also some fine moments regarding the Master being &quot;augmented&quot; by the Daleks -- &quot;You don't even know what it does, do you?&quot; -- and a brilliant twist ending that echoes, of all things, the end of &quot;Some Like It Hot&quot;! Overall, it's a riot.If I have any complaints, it's that the darned thing is too short! At (barely) twenty minutes, it seems more like a tease than an actual program. If the humor content wasn't so rich, I might feel cheated...however, given the fact that the producers were working under a limited budget, using borrowed sets and busy actors, I guess I can understand the reason for &quot;Fatal Death's&quot; brevity. The BBC must have realized this too, for they've been generous enough to include a documentary about the making of the special (which is actually pretty good, though a bit superficial), as well as three Doctor Who spoofs from other sketch-comedy shows, the funniest of which is the last. (The first one is a French &amp; Saunders sketch which was never aired, and it isn't hard to see why -- it's painfully unfunny. Still, it's better than Spike Milligan's terrible, racist Pakistani Dalek sketch from M6.) It all makes up for the shortness of &quot;Fatal Death&quot;, though if the sketches had been less uneven I would be giving five stars here instead of just four. Even so, I'm just glad &quot;The Curse of Fatal Death&quot; was finally released, and as a longtime Doctor Who fan I'm proud to include this in my collection.",Doctor Who - The Curse of Fatal Death VHS
440560,"I first saw Tora! Tora! Tora! a few years ago. At this time, I wasn't too interested in it. But with the recent release of Pearl Harbor, I decided to give this movie another viewing. While it does not have today's computer-generated graphics, it is a very accurate, entertaining and important movie about the Pearl Harbor attack.Unlike the recent Pearl Harbor film, which seems to have been made only to make money (Which it unfortunately did), Tora! Tora! Tora! was made to teach us about the attack and why it happened. Also, comparing Pearl Harbor's war scenes with those in Tora! Tora! Tora! is like the difference between night and day. Most of Tora! Tora! Tora! is live action and model work. They are excellently choreographed and filmed. Those in Pearl Harbor were simply made on a computer and are laughable compared with the still impressive live action work of this movie.Tora! Tora! Tora! tells in detail why the Japanese chose to bomb Pearl Harbor. Many people ask as to why the U.S was unprepared for attack on Pearl Harbor. The U.S assumed that no one would ever attack and that sabotage was a bigger threat. Plus, Admiral Yamamoto was pressured into planning the attack by the high command, who might have been pressured because they had recently signed an alliance with Germany.There are some extra features included on this tape. A commercial advertisement for The Sand Pebbles, Von Ryan's Express and Twelve O'Clock High and the Theatrical Trailer for Tora! Tora! Tora! are before the presentation. After the movie is a twenty-minute documentary, which includes interviews with historians, authors and teachers about the attack on Pearl Harbor. It is a well made extra and informative but I'll take National Geographic's Pearl Harbor: Legacy of Attack over it any day.Overall, Tora! Tora! Tora! is the best feature-length film made so far about the attack on Pearl Harbor and is one of the best war movies ever made.",N/A
429932,"I accompanied some frenzied, drunk software people on a bus to Whistler, BC, Canada one fine afternoon, and as if their loud, intoxicated musings were not enough, the organiser of the trip decided we all should watch movies since she was so kind and organised to have brought them. She also took the trouble (this was her first week of work as the group's administrative assistant) to make Rice Krispie treats. Most people were thrilled, cheering about what a nice admin she is. I whispered to my friend (he is the one who has to work with these software people everyday, not me), ""It's her first week. She is still kissing a**. Of course she made Rice Krispie treats. We'll see how long that lasts."" Whatever the case, we had to, just like being back in elementary school again, vote on which videos to watch. We ended up watching Face Off, and oh how I could have done without it. Nicolas Cage is possibly the only compelling thing about the film and even his villain was not very convincing. He seemed more slimy than evil. The whole premise of people surgically switching faces is ridiculous, although I thought it was a nice turn of events when John Travolta's character ended up stuck in prison as Cage's villain after Cage came out of his coma, found himself faceless, and forced the surgeons to attach Travolta's face to his. It is all rather... inane. For an action film it was all right. But Travolta, as usual, overacts. Really not my style. But maybe it is yours. If you like lots of shooting, fighting, explosions, implausible storylines, well, this just might be your bag.",N/A

From the time he arrives, until he leaves, we are left wondering about this shadowy individual.Lago is a small Texas town where not to long ago a brutal murder of a sheriff occurred, while the whole town watched, too cowardly to come to his aid.  &quot;Help me,&quot; he utters again and again, while his attackers whip him to death.Now enter the man with no name.  Is he the spirit of the dead sheriff, his brother perhaps, or maybe some kind of ghoulish devil?  Who ever he is, he quickly takes over the town, then takes charge of it, preparing for the return of the three men who killed the sheriff.  It seems his real attempt, other than to avenge the death of the sheriff, is to run the town into the ground; retribution for their earlier cowardice.  The most fitting reprisal being, perhaps, having the townspeople paint the town red, and then rename it &quot;Hell&quot;.Eastwood's character has no compassion for the people, and as much as he abuses them, we cannot somehow feel sorry the way in which they are being treated.  And even after trying to build up their defense, and train them to shoot at their targets properly and effectively, he still comes to their aid at the end - the bad man shouting out &quot;Who are you&quot;, and never given a reply.Most westerns are the shoot 'em up kind, which we enjoy.  The difference between them and &quot;High Plains Drifter&quot; is that this movie hangs on our moral conscience; and we don't soon forget it.",N/A

676953,"I must say I walked into the theatre with high expectations and the first 30 minutes I was in heaven. It was beauty, breathtaking, exciting, and amazing. But somewhere after the 7 minute love medly between Ewan McGregor and Nicole Kidman I started to doubt the quality of this supposed FILM...and decided that it was just a movie. There's a difference between FILM and a MOVIE. I hold Ewan McGregor in high respects (even though he is doing the new Star Wars installments) and Nicole Kidman I could take or leave.I'm not saying this is a bad film, because its not...Baz's idea to take songs like Paul McCartney's ""Silly Love Songs"" and Elton John's ""Your Song"" and put them in a movie set in the late 1890's is silly and sounds original and new yet doesn't work for me...much like ""A Knights Tale"" (oy vey!). Baz as a director is amazing and I was highly amazed at how he did this. I was going to say how much I loved the cinematography, but I was slow to realize...this was all done with computer...which is fine...but I guess its the indpendent film lover in me that bashes this movie which loses its originality within the first half hour. The whole idea of this movie is taking unoriginal ideas and putting them all into one movie and adding crazy effects to make them look original, sorry, its not working for me.  The dialogue is all overused dialogue I've heard and I've heard the music before too...so basically all that's left is the acting talent...Ewan was bright eyed and beautiful in this film and had a youthful dazzle to him.  ....By the end I was weary of it as a whole and I had seen it all before. I will give kudos to Mr. Luhrmann to trying to take a familar love story (poor poet falls for beautiful prostitute and she in return falls for him) and putting a spin to it. Though, I can't fully like this movie because for one it never finds itself, I never get a full definition of the characters...I think I know they love each other, but thats where it becomes hard because even though they sing ""I love You"" and that ""There is no greater thing than to love and be loved"", but I just didn't feel moved or anything. I go to see a movie to have it move me, to change my prespective...and thats why I went to this movie. But I left disapointed, weary and tired of the formulaty. But in the end, without the singing and the crazy computerated cinematography what is this movie? Just your run of the mill love story...love is great, and I believe in it...but I believe in a love that is more than this......, you'll never find any enlightments to love in a romance movie, because love is much more than that. Well, enough ranting. Good try, Mr. Luhrmann.",N/A

I am a Civil War buff and was afraid that this would be to fluffy compared with a solid history book and too anti-South as it is a PBS product.  Wrong on all counts.  It is a brilliant piece of work, moving, accurate, even-handed and comprehensive.  You will understand battles and strategies better than static maps in books can show.  I was moved to tears at times, especially by seeing the group shots of soldiers together before battle and some of the rare movie footage of old Civil War veterans in the 20th Century, including a very dignified gentleman with a white beard washing himself at a pump at a reunion, and you suddenly realize he only has one arm (watch for it).  You will be moved too even if you think you've seen it all.Minor gripe:  All land battles, too little non-military stuff (Confederate navy, diplomatic efforts in Europe, etc.) but these are flyspecks on an absolutely brilliant series.

Instead of the movie focusing on the actual event, and the heroes of December 7th, we had to endure watching two idiots fight over a woman, and then the attack scene. I will admit, the attack scene was very dramatic and the special effects were wonderful. That is the only positive thing I can say about this movie. Tora! Tora!

400780,"'Gunman's Walk' is one of those terrific films whose narrow focus actually serves to encompass huge themes, such as Family, Race, History, Nation.  It is at this point that the provincial or local becomes properly mythic.  Because although the story isn't really about much - a father, his kids, a murder - it is also based on the oldest story of them all, that of Oedipus the King, the story of a man who unwittingly killed his father, bringing plague upon the country he ruled.Although the Oedipal story seems deeply tragic and anti-social, it has been used by Freud and his followers to explain the processes of socialisation through sexuality.  The only way a society can ensure its continued survival is through a process that is adequately symolised in the Oedipus story - a child may resent his father's power over him, but one day he'll have to take his place in society, to 'kill' him.  Here the Oedipus story becomes a positive thing for conservative societies that locate themselves in the family.  Paradoxically, although it is the 'natural' order of things, it involves a great struggle, neither man willing to give up his position.And this is the crux of 'Gunman's Walk'  Lee Hackett is one of those legendary characters who tamed the West, who got there before the law did, who sees himself as a kind of privileged Founding Father.  Except father is the wrong word - he is so afraid of growing old, of being surpassed, that he insists his sons call him 'Lee', while retaining the powers of a father - he has to beat them in everything, convince himself he's still  young.  as this is contrary to nature, a sort of plague ensues, leading to moral breakdown, where a man can murder another and get away with it, because good old dad, sorry Lee, will sort it out.Lee's two sons have wildly divergent ways of dealing with their father's overwhelming pre-eminence.  Danny is the sensible, sensitive one, who defeats his dad, plays the Oedipal game, by simply ignoring his values, his macho gun-play, his turning everyday activities into masculine rites and tests.  He ignores his racism and his stifling brand of family loyalty.Ed, on the other hand, takes Dad at his word, and tries to defeat him.  Unlike Lee, though, he has not got a powerful social apparatus that he helped create to help him, and he goes speedily, violently, trigger-happy insane.  The film's best sequences involve Ed's increasingly doomed and desperate attempts to prove his manhood, to surpass his dad.The film, with its youthful, teen-market stars, seems to centre on the brothers, but it is really about Lee.  He is a near-tragic figure, his two sons split versions of his self, his potential for good leading to family, and his history mired in violence taken to extremes.  Van Heflin's brilliant performance, revealing the desperation behind the bluster, convinces us of this.But, as his name suggests, Lee represents so much more - America, its history.  the murdered boy is a Red Indian - Lee's stature derives from his own battles with the Indians which helped create the West.  Times have changed: family, civilisation and reconciliation must replace violence, reputation and individualism.  it sounds so easy, but director Karlson emphasises the fierce trauma and disruption of the process.  His deftly buoyant camerawork during action sequences is among the most vivid and exciting I have ever seen.",Gunman's Walk VHS

7166,"I've only recently read the novel by Kazuo Ishiguro and love it so much that I quickly got hold of the video. However, in my personal opinion, the movie didn't quite do full justice to the brilliant novel it's based on.Of course, with Anthony Hopkins and Emma Thompson at the helm of &quot;The Remains of the Day&quot;, we can be assured that the acting is nothing short of par-excellence. So far, I've not come across any unfavourable reviews of the movie, so it does feel strange to think that I may be the only viewer who's NOT gushing over how great the film is.The story is set in 1930s and 1950s England and focuses on the life of a traditional English butler, Mr Stevens, who serves the great house of Darlington Hall and of his unwavering loyalty to his employers and of his relationship with the housekeeper, Miss Kenton. One day in the 1950s (which is &quot;present-day&quot;), he finally decides to take a short vacation by borrowing his employer's motorcar for some sight-seeing of the country and to convince Miss Kenton (who has since married and is now Mrs Benn) to come back to work for Darlington Hall. During the journey, Mr Stevens reminisces about the good ol' days back in the '30s when he is serving Lord Darlington, a distinguished English gentleman whose good intentions with regard to post-WWII Germany backfires when he is later branded as a &quot;Nazi sympathizer&quot;.While reading the novel, I did wonder how well the story will transfer on film, because the novel focuses a lot on Stevens' thoughts and feelings which he doesn't show outwardly and so couldn't be projected on film, no matter how good the actor is. In the movie, there is also no voice-over to convey his actual thoughts and emotions. So what we get is Anthony Hopkins' butler who displays a very limited range of emotions throughout the movie - 1) Thoughtful (although we can't tell what he's actually thinking about), 2) Courteous (to his employers and the guests), 3) Curt (to Miss Kenton) and 4) Cold (90% of the time) - without a clear explanation. If you've not read the novel, I doubt you'll fully understand the nature of Stevens' character and the reasons for his apparent &quot;coldness&quot; and strange behaviour e.g. NOT bothering to console Miss Kenton when she is crying so desperately right in front of him, and why he decides to lie (to the people he meets during his car journey) about not being acquainted with Lord Darlington.My second complaint is this: in the novel, Stevens' &quot;present-day&quot; employer is a Mr Farraday, a nice American gentleman. But in the movie, the employer has been changed to &quot;Mr Lewis&quot; (played by Christopher Reeves). The problem is that the same &quot;Mr Lewis&quot; also happens to be the &quot;villain&quot; (in both novel and movie) who in the '30s tries to sabotage Lord Darlington's efforts to reconcile Germany with the rest of Europe after WWII. It is difficult to believe that Stevens (who so dislikes Mr Lewis) could end up serving him LATER on after Lord Darlington passes away.But the most dissapointing part of the film is the omission of what I deem the most important scene in the book: when towards the end, Stevens and Miss Kenton meet up again after over 20 long years and Miss Kenton confesses that the reason she is unhappy with her marriage is because she often wonders what kind of a life she might have had with him (Mr Stevens). And in the book, Stevens' heart is breaking when he hears that. It's a most moving scene - practically a declaration of love between the two, for goodness sake, and yet this scene is omitted in the movie.Watch the movie if you can. But do read the novel which is one of the most brilliant writings to come out of the 20th century. The words used are simply beautiful, eloquent and breathtaking. The book is most remarkable, but I really can't say the same for the movie.",N/A
125429,"That's what I say about this film. It's interesting on so many levels; for example: it's a rousing adventure and a somewhat tender love story, despite  some really barbaric scenes. Let me just say that I HATE Mel Gibson! I am not a fan of his, the only reason I have this film is because it won the Best Picture Oscar of 1995 -- that's all! But I do enjoy watching this film for it's vast shots of land (John Toll won the Best Cinematography Oscar), the battle scenes, and when Gibson dies in the end! Yes, it's harsh, I know, but that's how I feel about Gibson, who, in my opinion, is not a great actor or director (he just got lucky that year, like Kevin Costner, who I also hate with a great passion, did in 1990 for &quot;Dances with Wolves.&quot;)  Patrick McGoohan, as King Edward Longshanks, is wonderful as the resident baddie who, of course, outsmarts William Wallace (Gibson) and has him killed. And those two beautiful ladies, Sophie Marceau and Catherine McCormack, are lovely as Isabelle and Murron respectively.

It says much about the ambivalence that many Japanese feel toward society: on one hand, they feel a sense of obligation to sublimate their own needs to those of the group; on the other, there is a deep sense of resentment and a feeling that they are not properly appreciated for their sacrifices.

James Bond must stop Goldfinger's plan before it's too late. From an explosive teaser to a car chase in the mountains of Switzerland, and from a climatic battle in Fort Knox to a suspenseful fight to the death aboard an airplane, Goldfinger comes out to be one of the best and smartest movies in the James Bond series, filled with action, suspense, and elaborate set-pieces.This movie never bores and is one to be watched again and again.

528975,"I had heard and seen so much hype about this movie that I went into the viewing with some loathing.  As it turns out it is not a movie to loath but one to embrace at least for the moment as it transports you back to that heady time that was the early seventies.  It occurrs to me that this movie will make more sense and have more meaning to people in their forties as (we) lived it about the same time that Cameron Crowe did.  The movie is a bit of a &quot;cop out&quot; as it does not hold true to Crowe's actual/factual experience of being on tour with Led Zeppelin.  Now that would have been a 5 Star movie.  Instead we are treated to the on tour saga of a fictional Stillwater complete with a photograph of the band sitting on anvil cases a la Allman Bros. Band Live at Fillmore East.  Two stand out perfomances are Phillip Seymore as Lester Bangs and Jason Lee as the lead singer of Stillwater.  I read damn near every word Lester ever wrote and I do see him coming off as very cynical but not introverted and uncool as depicted in the film.  Lester/Phillip does have some good lines like:  &quot;Hey man I'm always home, I'm not cool.&quot;Some problems I have with Almost are constant references to the year 1973 when some of the soundtrack songs are from many years forward.  Russell on top of a house with a head full of acid shouting, &quot;i am a golden god&quot;.  A quote later attributed to Robert Plant in Hammer of the Gods.  Crowe's homage to his time with Led Zeppelin?  Not enough sex and drugs but plenty of booze and beer.  A very watered down seventies.Great soundtrack, great acting, good movie.",Almost Famous

533995,"ENEMY AT THE GATES (2001, R= Strong Graphic War Violence, Brief Profanity, and Some Brief Sexual Content) The Cast: JUDE LAW, ED HARRIS, RACHEL WEISEZ and BOB HOSKINS. The Genre: ACTION/ROMANCE/WAR/DRAMA The Plot: In the European battles of WWII, the best sniper ever (Jude Law) is found by a newspaper reporter, who ends up turning the man into a celebrity soldier, who will give the country hope in winning the war. After the fact, another famous sniper (Harris) is on the trail of killing him off. BASED ON A TRUE STORY. What Works: Realistic depictions of the early stages in the European battles of WWII. Great performances and heart-pounding drama, as well as powerful directing top that all off. What Doesn't: The moments where yet another, but realistic, romance forms between JUDE LAW and RACHEL WEISEZ when using a historical event as a backdrop for it. As well as the sleepy moments in between battles that are supposed to be a major part of the film, but just boost up more of LAW's performance. Reality Check: The battles are very real, but the final battle in the end is out of purportion of what the actual events were like between the two snipers (Harris, Law). The Catch: Since there have been so many war films being produced lately, like THE THIN RED LINE, SAVING PRIVATE RYAN, PEARL HARBOR, APOCALYPSE NOW REDUX- you may get tired of seeing another one. And this film does have some sex in it and strong, very graphic war violence- so kids should not see this film. OVERALL: &quot;This film is great, but has its own portion of cliches that take away from what could've made it the best film of 2001. Yet the performances, directing and battles are powerful, which helps ENEMY AT THE GATES hold its domain in the 4 star area.&quot;",Enemy At the Gates

By the time Ben Affleck's character even met Gwyneth Paltrow's, the movie was almost too far gone to save.  The beginning was that morose and uninteresting.

Overall, the film is just too predictable from the moment &quot;Buddy&quot; hands his ticket over to a stranger in the airport.  You know the plane will go down and the rest of the story rolls on in a nice tidy predictable fashion.",Bounce
132428,"This is exhiliarating filmmaking. Gorgeously shot and masterfully directed, Martin Scorsese teams up with screenwriter Paul Schrader to create a tale simliar (yet strikingly different) from their first collaboration, the amazing 'Taxi Driver'. Comparisons between the two films are inevitable: both have lead characters near the point of breaking who patrol the streets nightly (De Niro is a taxi cab and here, Nicolas Cage in an ambulance) briefly walking into people's live, each unable to connect with anyone. Cage's character spends each night patroling the streets of New York City, trying desperately to save lives but failing. He has been on a bad streak, patients seem to keep dying on him. He is haunted by the ghost of a young girl who shows up in front of his eyes, almost constantly, asking 'why did you kill me?'. He is assigned to increasingly unhinged partners (John Goodman, Ving Rhames, and Tom Sizemore... all perfect), begs to be fired, and falls for the daughter of a stroke victim (Patricia Arquette, convincingly torn and broken). It is a harrowing film, complete with many grisly scenes, and could easily be the most depressing film ever made. But Scorsese has other plans. The film is very much about redemption and salvation. About saving one's soul and how hard it is to do just that. Carrying us through it all is Nicolas Cage's wonderful performance, a walking time-bomb fueled by guilt and lonliness. The DVD edition is super-light on extras. No commentary track, just a few trailers and interviews. But the startling picture quality is enough to warrant it's purchase. A film this alive and hallucinatory benefits from the clarity of DVD. This is Scorsese's finest work outside of his usual ganster foree and should be seen by his fans and non-fans alike. It is a nightmare of a dream come true.",N/A

672784,"I ordered Vol. 1 of the ""Battle of the Planets"" DVD wanting to re-live some childhood memories of watching this show after school. It was nice to see the ""G-Force"" team in action after some 20 years. The episodes are great, that is until you watch the original ""Gatchaman"" episodes on which they were based. Then you realize just how much your childhood viewing experience was shortchanged.Put simply, the American version pales in comparison.  As a viewer, you will get to see just how how much drama, action and pathos were excised from these cartoons because of violence concerns by U.S. broadcasters. Many of those edited scenes were replaced with narration by ""7-Zark-7"", an ""R2D2"" rip-off created  to capitalize on  ""Star Wars"" which had been released a year or so earlier.  Watching some two decades later, you realize just how jarring this proved to the show's pacing. ""Gatchaman,"" however, moves at a more rapid clip.I almost forgot to mention, that ""Gatchaman"" was set on Earth and there were no 'battles' with other planets.  That said, you also realize just how awkward the premise of ""Battle of the Planets,"" was.  I gave the DVD 5 stars, but only for the ""Gatchaman"" episodes.",N/A
523074,"&quot;Gladiator&quot; is a film that should suit all tastes. It is an expertly mounted and eye-filling event; the blood and gore, delivered in split-second imagery (allowing your head to fill in the rest) should satisfy the most blood-thirsty movie goer; and the story is a superb tale of good vs. evil, power vs. honor, and &quot;Might for Right&quot;. I was reminded of &quot;Camelot&quot; many times during this film, especially by the almost unrecognizable appearance of Richard Harris as the wise and noble Marcus Aurelis. Joaquin Phoenix gives a bone-chilling performance as the evil and cowardly Commodus, who inherits the title of emperor upon his father's death. But the sole weight of this overwhelming piece rests on the shoulders of the magnificent Russell Crowe. If one doesn't believe in him, then one doesn't believe in this epic costume drama. Kudos to the rest of the cast as well, and hand over heart for the late Oliver Reed. But back to Crowe--he is an actor to contend with.  His work in &quot;Gladiator&quot; is a tour de force performance; he very nearly sprays testosterone from the screen. It's what was exactly demanded from him in this role, and he exceeds expectations in that regard.",Gladiator VHS
537253,"I went into this movie with high expectations because I liked all of Michael Bay's other movies. I liked this movie, but the love story? It was pretty boring! I kept looking at my watch wondering, &quot;where the hell are the Japanese?&quot; Don't get me wrong, you see them every now and then planning out their strategy on Pear Harbor. I guess I just expected more from this movie. The Attack is done very well. The special effects are top notch. The attack lasts at least 40-minutes! You have to wait 90 minutes before the attack comes. I know that they tried to make some story and they had to do something, but they should of thought of something else. Cuba Gooding, Jr. is only in the movie 15 minutes, if that, and I really liked his part in the movie. They really could have cut an hour of the movie and it would have been a lot better. Too bad that this really happened, because a lot of innocent lives where lost. I really felt bad for all the soldiers on the Arizona and all the others. I wish in the beginning they had explained better why we cut Japan off from oil? That came up in the movie for two minutes and that was it. You see, after the attack, how the Americans throw a little surprise attack on Tokyo. I never knew about that. I would recommend you see this movie in a good surround sound theatre. The bullets flying and bombs dropping are impressive. The musical score is very good and seems to go along with the movie very well.",N/A
18715,"First of all, I have to say that I have not read Virginia Woolf's book on which this film is based. Ms. Woolf is not an &quot;easy read&quot;, as her style tends to ramble a bit, and from what I understand, one could not literally translate &quot;Orlando&quot; to the screen. I commend Sally Potter for her adaptation of Woolf's novel. &quot;Orlando&quot;, to me, is about a person's journey of self-discovery. As the lead character says, &quot;The same person-just a different sex.&quot; There is a wonderfully sly mixing-up and playing with gender here. Orlando, an effeminate male poet who later becomes a woman, is beautifully underplayed by Tilda Swinton. I admire her performance, as it is played with a very subtle wit. Queen Elizabeth I is portrayed by that grand unwilling champion of gay rights Quentin Crisp, and the beautiful Billy Zane is treated as the &quot;love object&quot; in two scenes of lush sensuality. &quot;Bronsky Beat&quot;'s Jimmy Somerville, with his famous falsetto voice is here too, as a singing angel at the film's finale. His song, &quot;Coming&quot;, is wonderful, stating that gender doesn't really matter here-&quot;I am coming, I am coming, here I am, neither a woman nor a man.&quot; The art direction is breathtakingly beautiful, and Sandy Powell's costumes are remarkably accurate, spanning the centuries from Elizabethan thru Jacobean thru Rococo thru Victorian to present-day. Some may find the pace of this gorgeous film a little ponderous, but I found it to be an intriguing 90 minutes. We are all humans, individuals-why all this fuss about what a &quot;woman's&quot; role in society is, or what a &quot;man's&quot; role in society is? Virginia Woolf, I understand, based &quot;Orlando&quot; on a meeting she had with an Italian noblewoman who bemoaned the fact that she was denied her inheritance due to the fact that she was born a woman.

568675,"From late 1945 to early 1949, the Nazi assault on Europe was brought to closure with a spate of war crimes litigation, collectively known as the Nuremberg Trials. As an absolutely necessary vehicle for making the world comprehend the extent of Nazi barbarism, it was, in a sense, anticlimactic. After years of total war, with all its attendant death and destruction, the deliberations and speeches of judges and lawyers in a big room can hardly be considered otherwise. NUREMBERG, released as a U.S. television miniseries, depicts the first of twelve Nuremberg Trials, that one involving the legal prosecution and judgement of 21 members of the Nazi hierarchy: G&ouml;ring, Speer, Kaltenbrunner, Jodl, Frick, von Schirach, Raeder, Hess, von Papen, D&ouml;nitz, Frank, Keitel, Streicher, Schacht, von Ribbentrop, Seyss-Inquart, Funk, Sauckel, Rosenberg, von Neurath, and Fritzsche. Three others were indicted, but not in attendance: Bormann (not in custody), Ley (suicide), and Krupp (poor health).The cast is large, but the two principal players are Alec Baldwin as the U.S. Chief Prosecutor, Robert Jackson, and Brian Cox as Reichsmarschall G&ouml;ring. The former does his usual, inspired best to create a bland character. The latter does a wonderful job recreating the flamboyant Luftwaffe chief, although one wonders why the producers couldn't find someone who could do a credible German accent, much less any sort of accent whatsoever. (Perhaps that's one of the differences between a ""made-for-TV"" film and a big screen release.) Indeed, one of the film's best features is watching G&ouml;ring charm his way into the friendship of the Army lieutenant assigned as his personal minder, thus providing himself the avenue to cheat the hangman in the end.At one point in the storyline, Jackson's deputy prosecutors ask him who the Nazis' defense lawyers are to be. U.S. Army lawyers? German lawyers? Nazi lawyers? Jackson sidesteps the question, and the viewer never learns the answer, though it's obvious later on that Germans were assigned as defense counselors.  However, the defense's opening and/or closing statements were never re-created. This was a major omission, since some of the film's strongest moments came from the re-enactment of witness testimony and visual evidence presentation, as well as portions of the prosecution's opening and closing statements.NUREMBERG has a couple of totally needless subplots. Since the U.S. government denied its prosecuting staff the benefit of taking spouses along to Germany, Jackson was inordinately lucky to have along his winsome chief secretary, Elsie Douglas, played by Jill Hennessy.  While the two were waiting at the stateside airport for their ride to Europe, Elsie complains about having put a run in her nylons, and shows Jackson a bit of shapely leg to illustrate. At that point, I thought the trial depiction might degenerate into serving as the backdrop for some tawdry affair, but, mercifully, the director swerved away from that pothole in the nick of time. Then, there's the Army prison's Jewish psychologist, who spends his time trying to get a clue as to how the Reich's leadership could justify the genocide of his people. It isn't until he interviews the Auschwitz commandant, Rudolf Hoess, a witness for Kaltenbrunner, that he finally understands. Hoess asks the rhetorical question, ""Does the exterminator care about the rats he kills?"" (Actually, this was one of the film's strongest scenes, as Hoess is chillingly played.)For one with no prior knowledge of the Nuremberg trials, NUREMBERG will serve as a fine introduction. However, the good and bad aspects of the movie cancel each other out and result in a surprisingly spiritless piece. Though a film of fiction, a much better treatment of Nazi war crimes is THE MUSIC BOX, also reviewed by me on this website.",N/A

532703,"I have browsed briefly through the reviews of this film.  This will be a short review on the contrary of what 95% of the viewers have given the movie (four to five stars).From what I gathered, the movie is about one hour and forty minutes of Bruce Willis' character realizing just what he is...a seemingly immortal, ""unbreakable"" human being.Along the way, it's almost as if it's a search for an arch enemy.  When you watch this movie, you will understand, I guess.The reason i give this film two stars is that nothing really happens in the film.  It's a really good idea that misses out with it's slow and methodical tempo.  I won't necessarily say it's ""unwatchable,"" but I was disappointed with the anticipation I had for this movie.  Boredom and bedtime is really what pops through the mind once you reach the first hours end.Aside from the general idea of the movie, the only good thing I can say about it is that it looks pretty ... good.I realize I am in the minority in this review...but there are two sides to every story.

The look of the film is amazing; its period detail and grand ocean vistas make this a widescreen must.  Still, the main reason for the picture's success is the adept handling of its love story; this really is as close to a big-screen homage of THE LOVE BOAT as we are likely to get.  (I kept looking for Gopher or Isaac, the bartender, to show up in cameos, but they never do).  While the overall excellence of the film is beyond question, I feel it was a mistake to sink the ship.

However, as the film starts to progress, it just becomes more and more likeable. The star direction starts to shine through and the story of a courageous man starts to become more and more engaging. The film is too long and sometimes loses focus of who it's honouring, but remains extremely enjoyable and well-written diving flick. I thought the performances were absolutely amazing. Robert DeNiro is an absolute stunner, going through his characters stages and emotions like no other actor good, while Cuba Gooding, Jr. succeeds more than anyone else in the movie. His performance is, quite frankly, a masterpiece. He is this navy man. I believed his determination and no-one could've done better. Hats off to the actors! There were some very enthralling sequences like when Gooding, Jr's character stays underwater for 9 hours, 13 minutes just to become a diver and when he tries to beat DeNiro's character in a breath-holding competition.

One day he is surrounded by a circle of light and believes it is enlightenment, but it's not. This motivates him to give up his life as a fighter and search for more enlightenment. Yu Shu Lein (Michelle Yeoh) is also a crafty fighter and a love interest for Li, but it has never materialized. However, she is an independent woman, owner of Sun Protection, a service unlike Brinks Security and is well respected. However, she is missing Li from her life and we see it, when she discusses it with her mother, early in the movie.Yu agrees to take the sword to Sir Te, whom Li has chosen as it's guardian. He is in search for Green Jade, an assasin who killed his master years ago (a common theme in Martial Arts movies). However, on the first night in Sir Te's care, it is stolen.Yu meets a young woman named Jen, who is supposed to be married to another house to forge a stronger alliance for her father, a regional governor for the Emperor. However, on the night of the theft, it seemed that the thief came from the governor's mansion. Is it possible that Jen was the thief and even perhaps Jade Fox?As the story unfolds, more and more detail is added to each character's richness. (Spoiler)The relationship between Yu and Li is also poignant. In Asian culture, unrequited love is a common theme and it was not rare to see a man and a woman who have hidden feelings for each other, never end up revealing their love. However, the yearning that you see in M. Yeoh's performance is Oscar Caliber in my book and the regal-ness that Chow Yun Fat showed as King Mongkut in Anna and the King is reproduced and increased infinitely because I easily believed him as a old fighter, who has infinite wisdom from his years of experience.And the scenery. This is one of the most beautiful movies ever. The scenery, from the panoramic shots of the Forbidden City, to the sweeping grandeur of the Bamboo forest, the eyes are not forgotten in this tale of justice, loyalty and independence. Nor is the region of the brain that likes action. While the fighting in the movie serves as a vehicle to the characters, it takes a life of it's own. It is concept of classic Chinese storytelling that students of Wudan or Shaolin gain an enlightenment so great, that it gives them near superhuman powers. That is why you see so much flying. However, to those many westerners, this concept would probably not make any sense. Still, while the effects are wonderful, the flying was a little too liberally used to maintain dramatic effect. However, since this movie was originally meant for the Asian market, I'm not one to complain.I think that the break out performance came from Zhang Zi Yi. While she appears fragile, she had the hardest and most demanding role and she pulled it off magnificently. (spoiler)(Spoiler)The extended fight scene over the hairpin was overdone. I know that Ang Lee wanted to extend the scene to show her determination and defiance, but it felt like a joke that has gone on too long.Those were minor complaints to the excellent storytelling, magnificent performances and awesome action in this movie. Even though this movie was in Manderin with many Eastern philosophies, it is a movie that I believe can touch the hearts of many film viewers....Rating: A-","Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon VHS"
187746,"It's part of human nature to sympathise with the losers, the underdogs, the creative Davids in the face of corporate Goliaths; and the Fleischer Brothers' 'Gulliver's Travels' has taken a beloved place in film history as the nearly-was that challenged Disney's pre-eminence.  There's something knee-jerk in us that makes us automatically assume that 'Gulliver' is somehow superior, morally and artistically, to Disney's monster hit of the period, 'Snow White and the seven dwarves'.It has to be admitted, however, that 'Gulliver' is very flawed, and, faced in the 1930s with a choice between this and 'Snow White', I would have gone with the latter.  It is unreasonable to expect a cartoon aiming for a mainstream, juvenile audience to remain faithful to Swift's original, bleakly coruscating satirical vision, but once you have reduced the book's four sections to one, have removed the politics, philosophy and anything that might be deemed 'unfit' for family consumption (Gulliver's notorious fire-extinguishing is considerably sanitised), there's not a lot left.So the first problem with 'Gulliver' is its lack of plot.  there are lengthy set-pieces where nothing happens in the narrative, such as the engineering feat of tying up Gulliver, that can be boring for a young audience.  A related problem is character.  Unlike 'Snow White', which was scrupulous about naming and characterising all its players, 'Gulliver' has no-one to root for - the romantic couple are dull; Gulliver guffawingly bland; the comic relief irritating.  Add to this some ghastly operetta interludes, part of an unaccountable trend that also blighted the Marx Brothers' MGM films, and you don't have to look to the complete neutering of Swift's vision to complain.There is equally much to astonish, which makes it tragic that the Fleischers didn't get another chance to improve on this noble failure.  If the film is weak in close-up and detail, it offers some magnificent, wider compositions, such as the patterns of firelight scurrying around Gulliver's beached body, or the alarm-wakening of a sleepy community.  The book's point of view is completely reversed, so that Gulliver is the stranger observed through the eyes of the 'normalised' community.  Some of Swift's darkness is allowed to remain, especially in a late 1930s context, in the story of two egomaniacal, ultra-nationalistic rulers forcing a war.The story, influenced by 'Snow White' is given a Gothic, dark fairy tale landscape, increasing its visual beauty, while there is an extraordinary, Surrealist scene, where a King waltzes with a giant hand.",Gulliver's Travels VHS
363577,"Considering how hard it seems for directors, producers &amp; screenwriters to come up with a decent comic book screen adaptation, Richard Donner and company make it look so easy to do with Superman.  By far the best movie based on a comic book, Superman gives us a wonderful story that's both entertaining and heartwarming as it is loyal to the comic book purists who hate when Hollywood takes their favorite comic book heroes and turns them into something completely different.Christopher Reeve was born to play this role, and to me (and millions of others out there) his Superman is the &quot;Definative Superman&quot; that all others will be judged by.  He's exactly how we perceive Superman to be: Logical, strong, sensitive, enduring, with a heart of gold and so on.  He is also the real reason to see the last two Superman movies.  You can say what you want about the movies themselves, but you can't say that he's not good in them, because he is.  I paticularly enjoyed the added scene in this film after he's saved Lois Lane from falling out of the helicopter (and other assorted tasks) and goes back to the fortress of solitude where he converses with his father (Marlon Brando) of how good it felt and that he couldn't help himself.  Jor-El (Brando) tells him not to be hard on himself, but to be mindful of his vanity, for it was vanity that destroyed the Kryptonians.  Finally, Jor-El tells his son how much he wishes he could hug him and Superman reaches his arms out to him as he disappears.  I really liked that.  He has never (and will never) be able to hug his Dad and there's a true feeling of saddness about this that rings true.  I can't believe scenes like this were cut from the original release, especially the &quot;Gauntlet&quot; sequence when Superman goes underground to hunt for Lex Luthor and gets hit by machine guns, masses amounts of fire, as well as cold freeze before finally reaching the entrance of the evil geniuses secret lair.  Never should've been cut!I learned a lot from this DVD.  I was very shocked to learn that Alexander &amp; Ilya Salkind hired Richard Donner to direct Superman &amp; Superman II (as a two picture deal) and then fired him after the first film went on to become a huge success.  Apparantly it was due to creative differences, but I think they made a huge mistake when they fired him.  I'd go so far to say that Superman III &amp; IV would've been hits, had Donner went on to direct the enire series himself.  He would've looked at the script for part III and said, &quot;This is terrible!  Are you trying to destroy the franchise?!&quot;.  A special note to readers: Richard Donner did in fact direct scenes for Superman II, and had it not been for the fact that the original Superman had gone over budget causing part II to be delayed, he may have actually finished the whole thing himself.  What a pity that we'll never get to see what the Donner/Superman Saga would've been like.",Superman the Movie VHS

A perrineal portrayal of everyday people, living everyday lives, doin very everyday types of things that we probably don't like to notice ourselves doing. The fact that Kevin Spacey can fall over walking down a crowded row of bleachers at a basketball game and look like a loser says one thing: how obsessed we are with image. Then we think, &quot;Doesn't beauty rest in image,&quot; and this movie tries to say, &quot;Not the way we think it does.&quot; The wife in this movie makes this painfully clear in the beginning with her matching apron and ratchet: a nice little thing, but hardly beautiful. As the strange adolescent guy next door illustrates, beauty is essentially something inside of ourselves. He illustrates this clearly when he is watching one of his videos, and besides just liking what he sees, he speaks in a stream of consciousness and reflection. Clearly, there is more than meets the eye in real art.This symbolism described is repeated throughout the movie, and little of it is terribly new: a handsome, charming, and succesful man; rebellion by doing something unattractive; or simply deviating from routine. However, it avoids monatony by having each moment delivers something comic and develops both plot and character. It is nearly impossible to feel a lull or that you are not gaining personally from its meanings.",Belleza Americana American Beauty  VHS

94843,"I've paid more attention to this film more during the past decade than I did when it was originally released. Although the story might take some liberties, it captures the stately beauty of the British Isles.--Of Harold Abraham's world of Cambridge, theatre, and restaurants, and of Eric Liddell's world of the natural beauty of the Scottish glen, church life, family, and friends. The parallel to the subsequent Oscar winner for Best Picture, ""Gandhi"", is that both films feature Ian Charleson as a warmhearted minister, and John Gielguld as an upper-crust English bigot. As the object of Gielguld's bigotry, Ben Cross gives an intense, but dignified performance. He is a young man eager to prove himself, and he is very attentive to the advice of his coach, Massabini, a societal outcast like himself played by Ian Holm. He also succeeds in winning the affection of a beautiful Gentile actress/singer played by the very photogenic Alice Kriege. Cheryl Campbell as Liddell's sister, Jenny, helps her brother keep his life's goals in perspective. The American runners at the Paris Olympics are played by a lean and tense-looking Dennis Christopher, and an amiable Brad Davis. Nigel Haver's Lord Lindsay was personable and impish-looking. The costumes were splendid, the cinematography was sharp, the modern synthesized score by Vangelis representative of youthful zeal and energy, whatever profanity featured was mild, and despite the fact that the movie begins and ends at a memorial service, the singing of ""Jerusalem""--however reminiscent it may be of the ending of ""The Lonliness of the Long Distance Runner""--an earlier British film about running-was somehow uplifting.",N/A

165475,"I have watched this movie multiple times and have always found it to be a fascinating portrayal of colorful characters.  Larry Flynt, played convincingly by Woody Harrelson, and his real life brother Brett Harrelson, playing brother of Larry in the movie, was a nice touch.  I think that added to the believabilty of the portrayals too.  The most fascinating in a movie award goes to.Courtney, I LOVE you in this role.  Never have I seen an actress play a role so convincingly as musician and actress Courtney Love played the Althea Flynt character.  She was no less than mesmerizingly wild, beautiful, neurotic and one step away from self destruction from the beginning of the film.  Then once she joins Larry in taking his pain medication after the assasination attempt outside the courtroom paralyzes him forever, she spirals into oblivion so genuinely played,you can't wait for her scenes.  In my opinion, she makes this movie achieve greatness.Ex-NYC mayor Rudy Guiliani's ex-wife, Donna Hanover, plays a great role as evangelist sister of ex-president Jimmy Carter, Ruth Carter-Stapleton.  She introduces Larry to the re-born life, only to lose him again after he is shot, and the epiphany he experienced through her mentoring, is lost.Edward Norton is also wonderful as Larrys long suffering lawyer.  When they go up against Jerry Falwell in court, Woody is truly hilarious as Larry at his most ornery.  All in all, a very entertaining movie that the prudish, or devout won't care for...but they know who they are, and probably wouldn't be watching this film anyway.

I thought that he was even better than Sylvester Stallone in any of the ROCKY films. I also thought that the plot was extremely well crafted than the ROCKY film stories. Rocky, he had no other reason to fight than for his own self-interests. I thought this movie had it right: a former boxing champion forced to return to the ring after ten years because the dream that he's been fighting for is about to be lost. I also liked the Spiritual background of Carman's character, Orlando Leone, Jr. Being a Christian myself, I found this to be a refreshing boxing movie that was more about fighting for a dream than fighting for your own personal ambition.

698745,"I am far from an expert on French film. But as an AP french student, I have seen the eccentric, the subtle, the whimsical, the heroic, the tender, and the callous side of French cinema in films like My Life in Pink, My Mother's Castle, and The Horseman on the Roof. So there, I went to Amelie with some expectations from those past experiences. But actually, many raving reviews received before the film was even released in the US gave my impatience the needed extra push.The story is about a Parisian girl named Amelie (a wide-eyed elfish/nymph like Audrey Touton) who grows up to become a heroine bigger than the aimless life she seemed destined to lead. Having discovered the joy of charity and creating miracles for all those around her, Amelie is at last ready for some miracles performed for her. And enters Nino, an unlikely Prince Charming, whose boyish chagrin adds an extra charm to the already light-hearted film. The whole cast is amazing as one eccentric character after another is introduced and subtly pricks the audience's bourgeoisie/mainstream taste and conscience. The pace is delightful as director Jean-Pierre Jeunet moves his camera through the streets of a dream-like Paris. Everything seems perfect in Jeunet's world as the colors of clothing and the mood, the atmosphere, the music coalesce to contrast the emotional edges that chafe inside all of us. Amelie is determined to change everyone's live by scraping off those edges, and by the end of the film, I myself was ready to doubt the feasibility of unhappiness.So how is Amelie the film French? Like a sophiscated, artsy informercial, Amelie possesses a light, springy, optimistic tone that easily seduces the audience into believing there is beauty in the world and poetry in even the most banal occurrences. But Amelie the film is also universal, especially now. Because without the heavy grandiosity (so prevalent in escapist films of the war and patriotic genre), Amelie speaks to the heart, and unleashes another form of heroism ~ the most unobtrusive kind.",Amelie

Two scientists (Peter Cushing and Doug McClure) pilot a giant drilling machine which goes off-course and winds up in a strange land in Earth's interior.  In the original novel, the inner world of Pellucidar has no &quot;time&quot; as we understand it, because there are no astronomical events to measure the passage of time.  Needless to say, there is no such interesting idea in the film version.  Cushing, usually a fine actor, is embarassing to watch as a dotty old scientist with a &quot;funny&quot; vocal delivery which, in one scene, he forgets to do!  (I guess the director didn't notice.)  The inner world looks basically like a cheap amusement park ride, complete with highly unconvincing rubber monsters.

185237,"I'll readily admit, my expectations were rediculously high.  As a fan of both the Brother Cadfael chronicles and actor Derek Jacobi, I assumed that like the actor, this DVD would be a perfect combination of style and substance.  I wonder if this might be one of the TV series' weaker episodes.Jacobi is perfectly cast as Cadfael and carries the role very well.  While there are other good performances, some are a bit overdone, and some are a bit wooden.  Author Ellis Peters did a wonderful job of interweaving multi-leveled storylines together in her books, but that sense was impossible to capture in this episode's condensed 85 minutes.  Though the show moves swiftly and conveys all the key points, it ended up feeling a little flat.On a technical note, the DVD picture is remarkably clear.  The &quot;extras&quot;, however, left me wanting.  There are only 10 - 15 production stills, and not much background on either the making of the episode, characters, or actors.  There is one very nice touch:  an audio track of Derek Jacobi speaking candidly about his portrayal of Brother Cadfael.",N/A
688755,"Why this movie has been lauded to the skies by our elite critics is beyond my comprehension. Granted it's an exercise in neo-noir and hence not overly burdened with ideas or introspection. Unfortunately, it has inexcusable holes in basic character and action big enough for Lake Tahoe to flow through. One of them is the gay business, and this not for reasons of tolerance or homophobia. The boy in the film is only 17. He's been drinking (at the Deep End bar?) and having sex with a person the law might deem a pedophile, not a gay man. Is it probable that a post-modern suburban MOM would go to the bar with the wimpy request that the older man &quot;stay away from my son?&quot; Now it's true that she's a boomer and a yuppie. After all, her son plays water polo, and her daughter takes ballet. These are dead giveaways. But how much &quot;tolerance&quot; should we expect from her ?More probably, she'd try to get the bar closed down for serving minors and the older man arrested for statutory rape. Similarly, if she sought to reach her husband on a ship at sea, in these circumstances she certainly would say, &quot;Yes. It IS an emergency.&quot;Her reticence here is just another plot convenience, and a transparent one at that. Furthermore, the pacing for this draggy film, an alleged thriller, should be much faster, so one doesn't notice the absurdities. All in all, this film is just another variant, and an inferior one, of &quot;Fatal Attraction.&quot; Once again, a suburban American MOM defends her dysfunctional home from outside predators.But here the transparently convenient turns of a labored neo-noir film strain credibility.",N/A
562088,"I always knew Gene Hackman was a superb actor but he eclipses even himself in the complex layering he gives us of a man under suspicion of double rape and homicide.  It reminded me early on of a French film I had been oddly unmoved by, 1981's &quot;Garde a Vue,&quot; and then I learned this was a remake of that film.  Usually, we Americans ruin it when we remake French films but this time I think it is quite the reverse.  One reason is Hackman and the other is that the director and writers have opened this film up so it lost its stagey aspects and moved well beyond the confines and restraints of the police station. Hackman is interrogated by Morgan Freeman, no slouch himself in the acting department.  However, Freeman's police captain character simply does not have the complex nuances of Hackman's. Picture a man who absolutely hates his life, although he is rich, at the top of his profession and married to a beautiful but much younger woman.  What might this man do to release himself from the deadliness of his daily life?  Would killing two girls release him from the grips of this being-dead-while alive state?  Or would he be more likely to shoot himself in the foot or walk in front of a bus?  What extremes of human behavior will he go to in order to break out of walking around like a zombi? This is the fundamental question you have to ask yourself about Hackman's character throughout and he indeed has you vacillating on predicting what he did do.  When you run the entire film back through your memory, the ending, which I cannot tell you, completely fits.  The end makes total sense if you tuned in throughout to each particle of the character that Hackman gave you, starting with the time he first picked up the phone to call the police.  He, after all, is a lawyer who should know better than to open a door he wants to keep shut.  Or does he?",Under Suspicion
328965,"Set in neutral Turkey circa WW2, this nearly-forgotten film is a fast-paced tale of espionage. Its great cast includes coin-flipping tough guy George Raft, the elegantly duplicitous duo of Lorre and Greenstreet, Brenda Marshall as a comely commie and Turhan Bey (The Mummy's Tomb) as a confidant of Raft.Ankara is portrayed as the dangerous, exotic city it must have been in those tenuous years, with bombings and stealthy dealings in darkened alleys. All the world's powers had converged upon that strategic point, engaging in covert knifings and more overt misinformation. The Germans in this movie plan to leak out a map alleging that the Russians plan to invade, hopefully tilting Turkey to the Axis. Therefore the Nazis, Russians and Allies seek this map at all costs. Raft may be just a travelling salesman, or is he something more? Who can be trusted? Can Truth, Justice and the American Way prevail? Rock on, brother.Raoul Walsh has never gotten the credit he deserved as director. He helmed some of the best suspensers in the first half of the 20th century: Thief of Baghdad (1924), High Sierra, Pursued and White Heat, to name a few. Here again he is up to the task of providing a crisp, actionful movie, with a brisk car chase spicing up the latter sections. (Not up to the latter-day stunt standards of Lethal Weapon 4, definitely, but well-done.)The only thing realy lacking is an abundance of the razor-sharp dialogue some other 40's programmers possess, but if you like studio genre films from Hollywood's golden age (shot, as the box says, in glorious black and white) you will very likely enjoy this one, too.",N/A

69347,"Jack Griffin is a brilliant scientist who has some ideas that his peers think dangerous and unethical. Not one to be dissuaded, Griffin successfully experiments on himself, becoming the first human to be rendered invisible.  Unfortunately, prolonged invisibility--or possibly the invisibility drug itself, as his peers had warned--begins to deteriorate Griffin's mind, and he soon becomes a power-hungry killer bent on revenge.Though rarely seen in the film due to the special effects and costuming demanded by the part, Claude Rains does a dynamic job in the role of Jack Griffin.  His gravelly voice and vocal histrionics serve perfectly in delivering to the audience Griffin's descent into emotional hell.  And James Whale's direction is as brilliant as ever, creating the appropriate mood and atmosphere as we follow a madman's ravaging of the English countryside.One of only four Horror films directed by James Whale for Universal, THE INVISIBLE MAN is a work that some historians and critics regard as a veiled allegory of the director's own publically covert homosexuality.  While FRANKENSTEIN and BRIDE OF FRANKENSTEIN also depict societal outcasts in a sympathetic light, the eponymous character in THE INVISIBLE MAN is a character in a situation that is most like Whale's own--a respected genius in the public eye, but a person whose true self must remain invisible.Even if you don't buy that particular historical perspective, THE INVISIBLE MAN still works as an allegory of any societal pariah. We all have traits that we sometimes hide from others; we all have masks that we wear.  And at the times when we dwell on the things we keep hidden behind those masks, we may feel just a little &quot;invisible&quot; to others.  So in watching THE INVISIBLE MAN, Jack Griffin becomes a metaphor for our own private identities, and we care about what happens to him.  As with many of Whale's films, this pathos for the protagonist becomes a skeleton on which hangs the overall plot.Compared to contemporary movies, the special effects in this film might seem a little dated.  But the script is good, the directing is great, and the acting is superb.  Anyone who enjoyes a well-crafted movie certainly won't be disappointed.",N/A
584051,"Episode 24 starts off with a big bang, as the last Angel is introduced and Shinji's most traumatic decision must be made.  It's in line with the brutal nature of the show's latter half, with a particularly striking use of Beethoven's Chorale Symphony and a grand, climactic, still frame, all filmed in a manner that recalls one of director Anno Hideaki's big influences, Stanley Kubrick.  Perhaps Kaoru could have had more time for his character to develop, and hence made what happened later in the episode even more affecting, but overall, 24 is a superb finale to the regular part of the show.And then . . . oh boy.Much has already been said about this controversial ending, where Anno pulls the rug from under the expectant viewer.  On their own, 25 and 26 aren't that bad--they're well-presented, intelligent, and at times brilliant and profoundly moving in its psychological exposition (the &quot;alternate reality&quot; sketch is one of the best moments in the show, period).  Nevertheless, and I speak as someone who adores artsy-fartsy foreign films, non-linear plotlines, and experimentalism, it just doesn't serve as a good ENDING for a story.  No matter how artistic you are, leaving a viewer hanging with too many questions AFTER you've tantalized them for 24 episodes, and then calling it a day (as was the initial plan) is unsatisfying, and possibly cheating as well.However, I think Anno knew this, despite his initial denials in the press.  For a while he shaved his head in repentence for a time after it was made, and then made the Evangelion movies to wrap up the plot (though not without the first half being a bit too spiteful, I think, though the second half of the movie may be in fact the pinnacle of his anime directing). It's sad that the fans took it so personally, though--as revelatory and eye-opening as Eva is, it's still just a TV show.  Furthermore, according to an interview from Toshio Okada, one of the founders of Gainax and Anno's friend, many of the circumstances that surrounded the making of these two episodes were out of his control. Schedules were getting tight, as was the budget.  He did the best he could under the circumstances, and what he did isn't worthless. It has value, but just falls short of some of the commanding heights that the series reached from episode 16 to 24, which are nothing short of the most affecting television I've ever watched.  Those episodes alone ensured Eva's status as an anime classic.I can see how those who haven't seen the movie might feel cheated after watching 25 and 26.  So to any disenchanted viewers, I would suspend judgment until you've seen these episodes in conjuction with the movies--compare them and contrast them--the story does feel complete and the endings do (imperfectly) complement each other. You'll get the plot more or less wrapped up along with a detailed character resolution that is still more or less unmatched in any other anime.&quot;Evangelion&quot; scored Anno a place among the great anime auteurs-- Miyazaki, Oshii, Otomo, Tomino, etc.  These episodes and the movie together do show that there was a vision behind the madness that is worth seeing.

This is an unusual variation on the genre in that it features several fights involving people in hiding and in close quarters, including a bout between two people in a crawlspace above an inn where they have been separately spying on a third.The plot involves a search by four competing members of a secret martial arts society to locate and assassinate Lei Kung, a kung fu master who had abandoned their sect and gone into hiding. Converging on the town where the master is residing, they expect to draw him out by provoking him to show off his kung fu, but he is too clever for them. It takes a while, but two of the four become allies of Lei Kung, who eventually comes out of hiding and fights the other two, including a final battle with the sect's current head, Master Ti, involving the 18 weapons of the title. All the fights are imaginatively staged, most notably one in which Master Ti uses his hypnotic powers and a voodoo-type doll to manipulate an impersonator of Lei Kung (played by the great Alexander Fu Sheng) to fight off a bunch of attackers.The standout cast is headed by director Liang himself, in the role of Lei Kung, while his own brother, Liu Chia Yung (aka Lau Kar Wing), plays Master Ti. The two fight each other in the final contest of legendary weapons. One of the four sect members is played by Kara Hui Ying Hung, a beautiful fighting femme employed frequently by director Liang. Gordon Liu (MASTER KILLER) plays a Shaolin monk seeking out Lei Kung and has one of the final battles with him. The cast is rounded out by Liang regular Hsiao Hou as another sect assassin who becomes an ally and a funny performance by Fu Sheng in a smaller part.Director Liang frequently sought to infuse his films with authentic styles of kung fu; he was particularly enamored of stick and pole fighting and features some elaborate weapons in the final battle, including a three-section staff. While the available DVD of this title is not the highest quality--for one thing, it's not letter-boxed--it remains the best current way to see this expert kung fu film.",Master Killer Collection: Legendary Weapons
540727,"Usually film series degrade as they progress through sequel after sequel, but I would say that the Jurassic Park films are the exception. Perhaps my thinking is skewed because I went to the original Jurassic Park with such high expectations, and was let down, but went to JP III expecting a stinker, and well, it was a watchable film.Most of the credit for the film's watchability goes to Trevor Morgan, a rare child actor who neither mugs for the camera nor delivers cute one-liners written by a screenwriter who has no idea how adolescents talk. Frankly, I was a little bored until he appeared, then the film picked up; he injected some life into it, even managing to act and react among adults who were giving less than sterling performances.William H. Macy plays boring middle aged monotone guy that made him famous-- not to be confused with his occasion turns as shouting angry middle aged guy. This is all he's expected to do, and he delivers.Tea Leoni is completely wasted. She is a fine comic actress, and G-d knows this film could have used a little comic relief, but as there is none in the script, she has little to do besides be shrill and whiny. Poor Leoni seems to realize how ridiculous her character is, and just can't help occasionally stepping outside her, just to let us know she knows. A fatal mistake, but I suppose better than letting people think you think you're delivering serious Oscar material.Sam Neill squints at things, and makes lots of scientific pronouncements, and is believable if not compelling. For me, he will never do anything better than My Brilliant Career, though, so it's useless for me to comment on his performance.The CGI is as good as ever, I suppose, although I never did get a good perspective on the sail-back dinosaur. I couldn't figure out how big it was supposed to be. At first it seemed at big as the T-rex, in their confrontation scene, then later, there's this jaw shot, where it seems to have a very long neck, but not such a big body; at the end it is huge, a real monster. But all the eyes were good; the dinosaurs had penetrating gazes that were quite frightening. To be able to achieve that effect of real eye contact is quite an attainment.I don't really know how many people see these movies for the plot, per se. Isn't the plot really an excuse to show off the special effects? In this film, the writers have abandoned all pretense of science (all that ridiculous DNA frog fiction in the original film, e.g.), and made a fantasy. I enjoyed that much more.I hope Trevor Morgan gets some kind of special Oscar.",Jurassic Park III VHS
529742,"With its frank depiction of drug use and its gritty down to earth feel, I enjoyed Traffic and expect to see director Steven  Soderbergh walk away with an Oscar come Academy Award time.There were 5 or 6 different story lines, a few of which came together at different points. One involved Michael Douglas  as Robert Wakefield, an Ohio State Supreme Court Justice turned United States Drug Czar having to deal with not only  the national and international drug problem, but with the fact that his 16 year old daughter was a drug addict. Another  story line involved Benecio Del Toro as Tijuana police officer Javier Rodriguez caught between the corrupt Mexican  police system, and his moral obligation to make Mexico drug free for future generations. Another story line had Catherine  Zeta-Jones as Helena, an unsuspecting wife of a suspected drug dealer named Carlos Ayala (Steven Bauer), having to  cope with her husband being carted off to jail, and having her child threatened unless she pays off her husband's debts.  Mixed into that story line were undercover DEA agents Montel Gordon (Don Cheadle) and Ray Castro (Luis Guzman)  who are trying to protect the chief witness again Carlos, while trying to get information against Helena.What I really loved about Traffic was the documentary-style feel it had. Every location was shot differently, from the  blown out yellow grittyness of Mexico, to the rich upper class color of Cincinnati. Along with the graphic depictions of  drug use and the corruption of the Mexican military and police, it all had the feel of a real life drama, and not just a movie.  All the acting performances were wonderful. Usually a great director can bring out great performances from his/her cast.  It's no surprise that Julia Roberts from the Soderbergh-directed Erin Brockovich is a front runner in the Best Actress  Oscar race, and Benecio Del Toro is a front runner in the Supporting Actor race. Standouts from this movie in my view  include Zeta-Jones as a woman who is slowly transformed into the complete opposite of what she was by circumstances  beyond her control. Don Cheadle, who is one of the best hidden talents in Hollywood, and is just one big role away from  breaking through to mainstream. And the girl I thought had the toughest role in the movie, Erika Christensen as Caroline,  the 16 year old drug addicted daughter of the new drug Czar. I think her performance deserves more recognition than it's  gotten.The feel of the movie is really what makes this film a cut above others. It doesn't pull any punches in its portrayal of what  life is like for some people. We get to see the inner workings of a corrupt Mexican military, abusing its police power to  steal the lucrative drug trade for itself. We see how even if a police officer is on the moral straight and narrow, he has to  bend to the facts of life to survive on the streets. Back in America we see that even the drug Czar of the United States can  have problems in his own life that are bigger than the country. And we see how a woman will go anywhere and do  anything to protect her children and her family. Director Soderbergh has taken us inside the lives of these people without  glossing it up Hollywood style.Traffic is a hard hitting film that may be too much for some people. The scenes of drug use are hard to deal with at times.  Seeing what a 16 year old girl will do just to get a fix is troubling. The only part of the film I guess I didn't believe(?) was  watching the drug Czar comb the streets looking for his daughter, instead of calling out the National Guard or something  to track her down. I understand he had his reasons, wanting to keep the whole situation quiet and away from the press,  but it still seemed odd that a person in his position would be willing to wander the streets looking for her. The other  problem I had was that some of the story lines and people got confusing to me, and made parts of the movie hard to  follow. Luckily most of it all came together near the end.Overall I enjoyed Traffic and I would recommend it to people looking to get out of the Hollywood-style movie scene  we're all used to seeing.",N/A
471537,"As a fan of the original series by Matt Stone and Trey Parker, I really enjoy the blatant fashion in which the characters mock society with the way they act and behave. The way the messages are dished out en masse to us are all at once hilarious for the sheer gall and ease in which it comes out from the characters, unnerving for the fact that its accepted this kind of humor isn't for everyone (you don't want the wrong people buying too much into this), and saddening because most of the misfortune and extremely politically-incorrect humor is simply a mirror of the non-sense that occurs in society without most people realizing it. To explain this point a little better, the feature plot to the movie revolves around a small PTA's fight to destroy Canada because they disagree with the silly toilet humor of two of their citizens: Terrence and Philip. Its funny because its not uncommon for organizations to fight against such issues, especially in the United States, but to the point of genocide and war is an extreme that is so out there it gets a laugh. Its unnerving because the way the organization is characterized is comedic but can be easily interpreted as a negative sentiment about such organizations as the PTA, and for that reason it really is saddening. Saddening because, when you take a step back and examine how these organizations really work, a lot of them really are that fanatic, a lot of the fights are led by people who are good-natured but are corrupted by their own ignorance to the issues they fight against. That however, is another rant all in itself.A lot of the humor is very transparent, a lot of it based on the profanity which is laced in almost every sentence that is spoken in the movie. A lot of the humor, as I noted above, can be interpretive as well. The way people act is both comedic but is also a direct mock-up of society.The only reason why I didn't like this movie was the musicals. They are enjoyable at some points, but seem to interrupt the movie at others, and are completely forced upon us at other times. In all, I recommend the movie, but I also recommend showing extreme discretion as to who watches it with you.",N/A

10504,"Such a film is a masterpiece of realism and cynicism because realism is always cynical in front of evil, because that sadism here aims at showing the horror of black ghettos or urban projects in Los Angeles. It illustrates the fact that the vast majority of black murderers kill black victims. It is in fact the same thing as for white murderers and white victims. Who is the copy cat? Or is it a rule that you murder one of your own? In other words crime is not racist, not even racial, in its vast majority. It is nothing but the result of a social, cultural, ideological, economic and political situation that nurtures it. But the film provides absolutely no answer about that social situation. Cynical black cops who can only repress, even the innocent, when they do something at all, especially when that innocent is black, though most of the time these cops do nothing as for protecting the black community against the crime it feeds and raises in its own heart like a pet in a home. There is no hope except escape, go away as far as possible to free ourselves from the white plot that locks blacks together to produce a self-destructive boiling pot of a community, not even seeing it may be a time bomb that could harm the whole society when it explodes. It only wants to impress the audience with a fate, a fatality and create in its audience a feeling, emotion of total rejection based on disgust, maybe even hatred. But there is no hope anywhere in that film.

544374,"The movie was excellent- a horror movie that is scary, entertaining (if a bit slow), haunting, and deeply depressing at the end.  It has a chilling ending and leaves you hoping shes forgiven.  I thought the movie was tragic ghost story that has the dramtic depth and character that THE SIXTH SENSE had, this ending much more sad and the movie is much more elegant and wonderfully directed and stylized film- which ranks it over THE SIXTH SENSE(8/10), which I loved too.  Definitely 9/10 or ***1/2.  Go watch this symbolicly textured film  (which can be taken in many different ways), or watch it for the beautiful Nicole Kidman, or to watch a classic ghost story thats SCARY!  Nicole Kidman did a wonderful job portraying a character who needs such a wide range of emotions.  The children are believable and the supporting cast is solid.  Nicole Kidman is let to show her acting talent with a tormented character who gets your sympathy and then throws at you her secret that you hope shes forgiven for.  The drama depth and symbolism is used wonderfully here.  She truly loves her children- but the loss of her husband, her isolation, and her childrens sickness drives her to the edge.  She is a deeply religious woman- where does she think she is?  She truly loves her children and it is a tragedy to see everything shes gone through with the loss of her husband.  Its scary as well and has the classic fog-ladden house and creepy bumps in the night.  It is stylishly directed and every action scene is directed with such intensity (I loved the scene in which the the children wake up in the morning to discover- well, if you watched it, you should know).  It reaches back into the classic horror stories of THE INNOCENTS and THE HAUNTING, who share a great deal with this film: the power and haunting and emotional depth as this film.  I loved this movie and it is one of my favorites.  It ranks with some of the best horror films and, besides all the script and deepness stuff, its a great thriller with some delightfully jump out of your seat moments and freaky scenes.  The little kids are adorable and it is delightfully creepy.  Watch, enjoy, and even tear up in this tragic story with character for the quality people, horror for the thrills.  The last scene is haunting and beautiful.  Go see it for Kidman's performance and the kids.  9/10 ***1/2",The Others

82153,"This film catapulted Julia Roberts to superstardom and with good reason.  The film itself is a light but entertaining romantic comedy about a wealthy and unemotional corporate raider (Richard Gere) and a flamboyant hooker (Julia Roberts).  The story isn't that original, being a variation on the ""love on the wrong side of the tracks"" theme.  However, it is full of charming and funny moments and Roberts' audacious effervescence is the perfect contrast to Gere's impassive macho persona.  The film had enormous popular appeal and surprised everyone, grossing $178 million in the U.S. and $463 million worldwide, establishing Roberts as one of the most bankable stars in a generation.At only 21, Roberts was a fresh talent with sexy girl-next-door looks who showed she could light up the screen with her acting.  With the guidance of veteran sitcom director Garry Marshall (""The Odd Couple"", ""Happy Days"", ""Mork and Mindy"", ""Murphy Brown""), she was transformed from a tall and pretty model type into a delightful romantic figure with an extraordinary sense of comic timing who earned a best actress nomination for her performance.The new DVD includes a good deal of footage that was left out of the theatrical release, and the commentary by Garry Marshall is rich in interesting trivia about the production.  For instance, he tells how Julia Roberts was so nervous about her first nude scene with Richard Gere that she broke out in hives, and they spent the entire day applying calamine lotion and makeup all over her to hide the blotches.  Also, the now famous scene where Gere snaps the lid of the jewelry case on her fingers was not intended to be in the film.  Marshall instigated a prank because Julia was dragging and he wanted to wake her up.  So, he told Gere to impishly snap the lid when she went to touch the necklace, and her reaction was so delightful that they kept it.This is a fun film that is worth seeing again now that it has been released on DVD.  I rated it an 8/10.  Though it is ridiculously implausible, it is enchanting and amusing throughout.  It is also an excellent look at Julia Roberts' early work, when she only earned $300,000 rather than $20 Million per film.",Pretty Woman VHS
363551,"The late 70s and early 80s was such a fantastic time to be a kid at the movies - the experience of seeing of &quot;Star Wars&quot;, &quot;Close Encounters&quot;, &quot;E.T.&quot; and &quot;Raiders of the Lost Ark&quot; on the big screen was exciting beyond words.  For me, though, one movie from that period stands a head and (broad) shoulders above the rest: Richard Donner's &quot;Superman: The Movie&quot;.Warner Brothers deserves applause for their TLC lavished on this previously-neglected classic.

527716,"&quot;Hollow Man,&quot; directed by Paul Verhoeven, is a sci-fi thriller that takes on a classic theme: invisibility. Although this topic has been portrayed in numerous movies, TV programs, and comic books, &quot;Hollow Man&quot; distinguishes itself with a combination of cutting edge special effects and menacing thrills. Kevin Bacon plays the film's main character, Dr. Sebastian Caine--whose name struck me as a subtle biblical reference to the &quot;mark of Cain&quot; (Genesis 4:15)The effects are truly the star of the film, and the filmmakers exploit the invisibility motif in many memorable scenes. Sequences such as a hunt for an invisible escaped gorilla are shot with flair. Good production values add to the film's visual appeal: every would-be &quot;mad scientist&quot; would drool over the high-tech laboratory created for Dr. Caine. But be forewarned: the film's gory violence may not be suitable for all viewers.The only real flaw of the film lies in the characterizations. Bacon's Dr. Caine is an unlikeable, arrogant creep who shows his disregard for both human and animal life from his first scenes. The film's one almost sympathetic character, a soft-hearted veterinarian, is whiny and annoying. As a result, I found myself not caring much for any of these characters. But this criticism aside, &quot;Hollow Man&quot; is an entertaining and visually stunning thrill ride.",N/A
359916,"Unlike the angel in &quot;Wings of Desire,&quot; who longed to be human to experience the pleasures and satisfactions of being in a physical body, the angel in &quot;Faraway So Close&quot; (more a companion piece than a sequel to &quot;Wings of Desire&quot;) longs to be human to see through man's eyes and discover why human beings find it so difficult to experience the spiritual.The angel reborn into a physical body learns the harsh lessons of life: humans can barely see beyond their own physical bodies much less glimpse the spiritual world; time passes quickly and often leaves one behind in the dust without anyone noticing or caring; and the bitterness of loneliness is a terrible thing. This is in direct contradistinction to the angel in &quot;Wings of Desire.&quot; That angel finds joy and satisfaction in love, work and family.Wenders, therefore, brilliantly shows us both sides of the human coin.

Innocent and optimistic, they seem to inhabit a world removed from the rules of ordinary reality. Forced to interact with the real world, however, they bumble and goof but ultimately prevail by means of that particular brand of grace known only to the fool.&quot;Way Out West&quot; (1937) finds my favorite fools traveling westward in search of the daughter (Rosina Lawrence) of an old friend so that they can deliver the deed to a gold mine that he has bequeathed to her. As you might imagine, things don't go exactly as planned and our heroes are soon forced to retrieve the deed from the clutches of a greedy saloon keeper (James Finlayson) and his wife, The Singing Nightingale (Sharon Lynne).The plot is basic and actually pretty thin, serving really as nothing more than a framework for the gags, mishaps, and antics of Stan and Ollie. This is not a complaint. There is not one false step, comically speaking, in the all too short 65 minutes of this film. The hat eating scene is simply wonderful, and the entire segment where the boys attempt to break into the saloon, ultimately enlisting their mule in the effort, is hilarious (&quot;I wanted to get the mule down.&quot; has become one of my favorite movie lines). Some of the best scenes are actually musical in nature: Stan and Ollie, inspired by the old timey crooning of the western Avalon Boys (&quot;commence to dancin', commence to prancin'&quot;) performing a little dance that has got to be one of the sweetest moments in cinema; Stan and Ollie themselves crooning &quot;The Trail of the Lonesome Pine&quot;, culminating with Stan unconscious on the floor!This is classic and timeless comedy, almost profound in its simplicity.

I didn't think I'd ever see even one show from this great old series again, let alone the 24 that are included in these two sets. Besides, I figured, even if this early/mid-fifties gem ever surfaced again it would be on TV Land or Nickelodeon and would be ruined by nightmarish commercial breaks (we have DSS), squeezed end-credits, and inane voiceovers.VCI to the rescue! I've just reviewed the two DVDs in this first set and watched the first two shows on disk #1 and am extremely pleased! Knowing how things unfortunately are sometimes done these days, I had feared a poor quality transfer and a certain amount of butchering to have been done, but that's not the case at all, thank goodness!I recall these shows from my early childhood, and they look and sound exactly as I remember them. Even the elaborate musical score that accompanies the end credits is there, complete and impressive as when brand new. The opening gimmick, where the facing images in the father/daughter photographs talk about each other, are there too--still clever, still cute, still funny! In fact, these shows are exactly as first viewed almost 50 years ago, but thanks to the clever writing (those early TV writers cut their teeth in the demanding medium of radio comedy) and the outstanding talents of Charles Farrell and Gale Storm (sigh!), these shows are still funny and engaging. I couldn't be more pleased!One last note about the quality. We tend to forget how relatively murky television was in the Fifties. Broadcasting equipment was primitive but improving rapidly. However, because microwave and satellite transmission had not yet arrived, network affiliates in the major cities actually got their prime time shows from the networks in the mail!!! Yes, the studios sent out 16mm film copies of the shows, and that's how the local stations showed them in the appointed time slots. Over the years ensuing, hobbyists have collected these old affiliate films, and that's in part why they are now available and in such good condition. Since these My Little Margie DVDs are made from those fine 16mm broadcast originals, instead of kinescope copies, the image quality is actually better than when they were originally broadcast!

If you do not, well the action scenes are a bit more brutal and in a fashion more realistic (martial arts fights don't last very long etc), and there's nice support from Pam Grier. Sharon Stone is here too.  That might be enough for you to enjoy it.The story is about a tough no-nonsense cop that's about to make an important drug base but is told to back off.  Why?  What's going on?  This was Seagal's first film and his acting is much stiffer than it is in later films (really). It's his second best film (behind Under Siege).  It was also directed by Andrew (Under Siege, The Fugitive)Davis who knows how to direct action sequences and went proved it to a wide audience in The Fugitive.",N/A

He more recent movies have seemed like he was bored making them and some of the action was lacking (I haven't seen Exit Wonds yet) but these 4 are probably his 4 best (Marked For Death was good also).I would reccommend this to any Segal fan.",N/A
260393,"This is the only original POTA film to not feature Roddy McDowall, and he is sorely missed. I guess redoing the last of Cornelius' scenes from the first one was supposed to ease the new actor into the role, but it really just points out how different the two actors are. Also, Charlton Heston gets little more than a cameo as the astronaut Taylor. However, the new main character is a pretty good replacement, and even looks like him to boot! The film avoids the pit so many other sequels fall into by assuming people have seen the first film. This lets it move along at a much faster pace, and essentially remake the entire first film in 45 minutes. Then we get some new stuff when the astronaut finds some bomb worshipping psychic humans underground. If you thought the trial in the original POTA was whacked out, wait until you see the underground church scene. In the notorious downer ending, Heston assures that he will never be in another Apes film by... well, I won't give it away. Suffice it to say that he doesn't come back, and only two characters make it to the next film. It's no classic like the first, but still a decent sci-fi thriller that helped move the series into the 70s,  when Escape from POTA, the best of the sequels, would be made.",Beneath the Planet of the Apes VHS

569570,"This an excellent performance (in German) of Fledermaus conducted by Carlos Kleiber, a superb conductor who simply has not recorded that much.  Kleiber nicely catches the fun in this Otto Schenk production, with a very nicely played score and excellent singers throughout. This is pretty much of a straight run through of the operetta, with no extended &quot;gala&quot; sequence in Act II (just a ballet very well done to the &quot;Thunder and Lightning Polka&quot;).  The sets and costumes are excellent, the performance very well recorded, and subtitles (including both the original German and English) are available.  The only downside of the DVD is the longish bit of spoken comedy (maybe 10 minutes but seems an hour) of the drunken jailer in Act III, a standard of Fledermaus productions.

429113,"One of the finest filmmakers ever, Ray never disappoints and Charulata is one of his best.A husband who loves his wife, but as in one scene where he strolls past her twice while reading his paper, he literally 'overlooks' her and her very fine qualities.  A man whose interests take precedence over his duties and responsibilities, he asks a relation to spend time with is bored and lonely wife.He asks another relation to oversee his newspaper's business affairs so he can have more time for doing what he prefers doing, writing for the paper and sharing it with like minded friends.Not wanting to give the story away, I'll just say that like all of Ray's films this one is perfectly told through more than just narrative, but also in the use of his superb cinematography and his sensitive portrayal of the people involved.Just as he discovers the real worth of his wife, the husband learns that the consequences of letting others care for what he loves best, are costlier than he had imagined.",Charulata VHS
259826,"In a way, I kind of feel for William L. Petersen. According to the IMDB, he's had about 30 roles. He's currently starring in and producing the very special CBS crime drama C.S.I He's done Shakespeare and other stage theater. Yet, someday he's gonna die, and his obituary is going to read &quot;Petersen starred in Manhunter, a prequel to Silence of the Lambs the film that earned Jodie Foster an Oscar.&quot;I had to think about this one for a long time, and I have come to the conclusion that its not a bad film. I'm always the first person to say that you have to try to look at a movie in regards to itself, not its peers. But on the other hand, I'm human and I have likes and dislikes, and I can say without a doubt that I liked Silence of the Lambs better.But it doesn't stop there, Petersen is also likely to spend the rest of his career being compared to his other &quot;little sister&quot; Julianne Moore. To put things in perspective, I'll say that I did like Manhunter better than Hannibal.This appears to be Petersen's &quot;method acting&quot; phase. Perhaps he is trying to relate to his character, William Graham, the FBI profiler who caught Hannibal Lecter (here spelled Lecktor) by using method acting. Graham has the ability to get so into character, to feel the killer's emotions so well, that he knows how he thinks and can behave as the killer would. Sadly, Petersen just doesn't quite have that skill (or didn't in 1986, anyway). He frequently comes across as weak and overemotional, when I think we are supposed to read him as troubled and intense. There is a difference.I've dwelled on Petersen enough, its time to examine the rest of the film. Manhunter was written and directed by Michael Mann (much like every other crime drama ever :-) ) of whom I consider myself a fan. Sadly, I don't believe the rest of the crew was quite up to the task of realizing Mann's vision. There are several poor edits in the film, sub-par special effects for 1986, and a few continuity errors in shots that easily could have been avoided.Or maybe Mann just couldn't quite realize the vision himself. Manhunter was released at roughly the half way point between Starsky and Hutch and Heat both of which Mann also penned. I believe that Mann's career may have had a perfect linear progression between those points. Heat is a brilliant and original work with drama, character and stunning action scenes. Starsky and Hutch is a dated cookie-cutter car chase cop show. Manhunter has aspects of both. At times, Mann will give us brilliant cinematography of establishing shots of a forest juxtaposed with a characters frantic facial expressions, or hand us a well thought out character profile that draws us into the film. Other times, he will instead give us sixty seconds of drab dialogue while we stare at half of Joan Allen's butt, or totally break character of the main villain in order to add a romantic sub-plot to the film.One thing I wanted from this movie was suspense. This is probably the biggest disappointment. I found the character profiles of the hero (Graham), the villain (Tooth Fairy) and Dr. Lecktor all very engaging. I enjoyed following Graham around and watching him discover the case through profiling. What I missed was the suspense aspect of the film. A good suspense thriller gives me enough information to try and figure things out for myself even as the characters do. I enjoy having my mind race to beat the hero to the solution and then seeing how close I came. In Manhunter this isn't possible. Mann doesn't allow us clues. We only discover them by through Graham who always immediately tells us what they mean. There is no wonder about what a plot element means because elements are only introduced at the precise moment that the story needs them. The film is still enjoyable, but the suspense is pulled from it, which immediately detracts from what good have given it a great deal more appeal.Still, I do recommend the film. Particularly if you are fans of the genre, Mann, or the other two films. It gives an interesting alternate insight into a world that most us have come to know intimately through the other films. However, I will usher a warning. Try not to think about that during the movie. This film has no real relation to the other films save a single character in common and basis in the same series of novels. Look onto it as its own entity or risk ruining it for yourself.",N/A

422786,"Startling film with a predictable ending, but for all its predictable conclusions, it is still gripping and sad in its inevitability. Thornton plays a mentally challenged adult being released from a hospital for the criminally insane. You learn early that he has murdered his mother and the mother's lover and is finally being released into the wider world of free people. He soon makes friends with a young boy, and this is of course when the conflict begins. The boy lives in a contentious situation with his mother and the mother's abusive, alcoholic boyfriend (Dwight Yoakum). Thornton's character, Karl Childers, does a great deal to change the boy's life, ultimately insisting in the end, ""You Will Be Happy"". You will just have to watch to see how. Also memorable here are the characters played by the late JT Walsh and a highly underrated John Ritter. Also look out for film director Jim Jarmusch in a small role.

The truncated version I have is the clumsily edited cut referred to above, and it is a real shame -- wieghing in at about 60 minutes, the episode is fun to watch and lives up to the goofy, low budget excesses of Dr Who at it's best, but the story doesn't really make sense because so much has been edited out.

25953,"If you must buy the THE THIRTY-NINE STEPS buy the Criterion version. And of course, if you are a film buff, you must buy THE THIRTY-NINE STEPS. Hitchcock's techniques are still taught in film making classes and this film is a good example of why he remains the master film maker.STEPS is a beautifully restored and artfully done black and white film from the 1930s filled with excellent shots dependent upon back-lighting, side-lighting, and underlighting. In addition, many of the techniques Hitchcock perfected are still being used in modern suspense thrillers - running figures sillouetted against the sky, a screaming woman whose voice becomes the shrill whistle of a departing train, boat, etc., leading characters handcuffed together, the chase onto and through a moving train. The autogyro the police use to chase the leading man was a forerunner of the helicopter. The autogyro took off on a runway like an airplane but was kept aloft by a rotary propeller like a helicopter and was in it's infancy in 1935. Surely this was one of the first times a conveyience of this sort was used in a chase scene. The use of the autogyro (helicopter) and other aspects of STEPS are found in many later films including Hitchcock's own NORTH BY NORTHWEST.The Criterion version contains the usual overvoice commentary; a documentary about Hitchcock's &quot;British&quot; period which includes the making of THE LADY VANISHES, the first MAN WHO KNEW TO MUCH, STEPS, and other favorites; plus a LUX Theater presentation based on the 1915 book THE THIRTY-NINE STEPS and starring Robert Montgomery.If you're interested in film history or Hitchcock, or just want to watch an entertaining story you'll enjoy this film. Prior to viewing STEPS, I watched Woody Allen's PLAY IT AGAIN SAM (a send up of CASABLANCA), THE MAN WHO WASN'T THERE--the Joel and Ethan Coen film &quot;noir&quot; currently playing in movie theaters, and the American Movie Classics piece on film noir. I found the connections between film noir and more recent films fascinating.",N/A
301301,"There's always a risk in filming historical persona and events.  For a variety of reasons,  Americans are particularly clumsy at this process.  The lack of long-term national traditions is  a major factor.  Another is the desire to be innovative.  Introducing new elements to a story is  mind-expanding, but almost forces historical flaws.  What we don't know we can fabricate.  If  it's done with the right actors and visual appeal, the accuracy can be overlooked.  This film is  a perfect example of a production that shreds historical accuracy and tradition, but gives us a  superb adventure story delivered within an excellent visual environment.&quot;Men in Tights&quot; was right - Costner doesn't sound British.  His effort in this film is certainly a  prime example of how Americans see the Middle Ages - stilted language, stiff delivery and  an exaggerated idealism.  Morgan Freeman doesn't sound terribly Arabic, nor are we given a  hint as to where his English language capabilities were obtained. Yet he adds so much to this production James Robinson must be congratulated for including him.  Alan Rickman, who nearly  walks away with this film, is perhaps the most convincing character.  With the possible  exception of Michael McShane, whose Friar Tuck is certainly a departure from traditional  portrayals, but which likely is the most accurate.Given all this carping, Robin Hood is a fine film in its own right.  With the American  penchant for simplicity, the story becomes a contest between good and evil, period.  We're  able to overlook the issue of how the crusades nearly bankrupted England.  Tax collectors  don't win popularity contests anywhere.  Rickman is just the worst of a bad lot, and gives  Nottingham's character an aura of evil rarely encountered.  One can't help but wonder what  this film would have been like if he'd played Nottingham's boss, King John.  Certainly, it  might have made the surprise ending with Big Tam's [Sean Connery] cameo as Richard more  interesting.  In all events, this film is well worth the investment so long as you don't take it as  history.  It was a lucky investment for me, since i bought it in VHS.

One thing I'd like to mention here concerns the audio portion of this DVD.  I found the Dolby Digital side much more dynamic-sounding...particularly in the low end/deep bass.  The DTS portion has spaciousness but lacks the low end/deep bass of the Dolby Digital tracks.  There is just much more &quot;punch&quot; to the Dolby Digital side.

Instead of focusing on the obligatory sexual politics or high risk audition (both are in the movie, but they are actually dealt with intelligently), Daldry looks to the anger, frustration, and yearning for freedom that a young boy expresses through dance.

544431,"Based on the previews, I expected The Others to pack more of a punch than it did.  That's not to say it wasn't a good movie.  The director did an excellent job setting up the spooky atmosphere.  The plot begins when Grace (played by Nicole Kidman) wakes up screaming.  That was a good beginning, but then the movie mellowed out after that.  Grace answers the door to three people--a mute girl and an elderly couple--inquiring about servants' positions.  She hires them, introducing the two women to her children, who are allergic to the sun.  It is up to Bertha and Lydia to keep the curtains closed and the all the doors locked.  Why isn't totally clear until Grace hears a little boy sobbing, then someone running in the upstairs hallway.  The movie takes an eerie turn after the sobbing.  The children start talking about the day their mother &quot;went mad&quot;, but they don't say exactly what happened to her.  We are left to assume that her mental decline occurred when her husband never returned from WWII.  Grace grows more hysterical, thinking that intruders are in her house.  The servants start conspiring with each other, to do what isn't clear until the end.  Whether Grace is going mad isn't clear until the end. This movie has all the twists and turns of The Sixth Sense, including the neat tie at the end.  But if you're looking for heart-pounding suspense, you'll leave the theater feeling disappointed.

446748,"In the early 70s, while touring with fellow Pythons, John Cleese (and then wife Connie Booth) stayed at the Gleneagles Hotel in Torquay, Devon, England.  After a day or so, the other Pythons checked out, but Cleese and Booth remained.  The others left for a nearby hotel, disgusted with the abusive behavior of the proprietor, one Major Sinclaire. Cleese -- as one might expect -- was fascinated and entertained by the rude and boorish attitude of Sinclaire.  ""He was awful.  And just wonderful,"" Cleese said in a recent interview.When Cleese had an opportunity to create a new show for the BBC, he and Booth developed ""FAWLTY TOWERS"" (Warner Bros, ...).  When the pilot was submitted, it was met with resistance by top BBC execs, one of whom wrote a famous memo that said the concept and script was ""cliched, unfunny and claustrophobic.""The premise is essentially about Basil Fawlty, a tightly wound guy who runs a hotel.  And all would be perfect in his world if he didn't have to put up with staff, including his  shrill but competent wife Sybil (Prunella Scales) and guests.In 1975 ""Fawlty Towers"" slowly caught the attention of a core audience with only six episodes.  Reruns in the UK and on PBS really caught on.  In 1979 another six episodes aired and were a huge success.  Over time, a hard core audience has steadily grown around the world.  For the first time, all 12 episodes are available, digitally remastered, on a three disc set. An extended, funny and sometimes personal interview with Cleese on each disc is a wonderful primer on his take of why this series works and is more popular than ever. He reflects on the origins of the material and his memories of his stay at the Gleneagles Hotel and the late, infamous, Major Sinclaire; he talks about using taboo subjects that make an audience uneasy and thus more vulnerable to laughter; explains the meticulous attention to the writing process -- each episode on one idea with two and a half weeks on the plot and six weeks for the dialogue; he observes why it's funny when characters like Basil are forced to behave in a way the audience knows is not an honest and authentic feeling of that character at a specific moment of stress.  And he talks about this being a comedy of emotions as opposed to a comedy of ideas (""Monty Python and the Holy Grail"").  There are also interviews with Prunella Scales and Andrew Sachs who plays the hapless Manuel (""Que?"").  Sadly, cowriter and costar Connie Booth is nowhere to be found in the special features.  There's a startling and strangely emotional two minute video tour, with an operatic aria on the sound track, of the burned out Wooburn Grange Country Club that served as the exterior for Fawlty Towers.But best of all are the 12 masterful episodes of outrageous faux pas, crazed desperation, manic dottiness and absurd gyrations.  See again or for the first time ""A Touch of Class,"" ""The Builders,""  ""The Wedding party,""  ""The Germans,"" ""The Psychiatrist,"" The Kipper and the Corpse"" and the rest.  They are the creme de la creme of sitcoms and arguably the best sustained six hours of farce in the English language.Beware of the commentary track by director John Davies on disc two.

I guess what I liked so much then was the extremely arch dialogue, but now I think I would just find such people tiresome. This version has some strong points: Edna Mae Oliver makes a great absurd woman, as always, and Mary Boland does an exceptional job as Mrs. Bennet, better than the nincompoop in A&amp;E. This Mrs. Bennet reminds me of people I have really known, so I appreciated the characterization. Edmund Gwenn delivers the most likeable Mr. Bennet I've ever seen, but of course, that's not faithful to the novel--part of Lizzie's maturation is her realizing her father's limitations. But what of Darcy and Elizabeth? Well, I'll always love Laurence Olivier, but with each viewing he seems to grow more and more prancing and preening. He has a way of gesturing with his hands into his chest which reminds me of a harlequin from commedia dell'arte. And Greer Garson's Lizzie? Others have said it: too old. What's even worse, for some reason, she has huge bows tacked onto her head in almost every scene! Oh dear, what a faux pas! She's something of a prickly pear too; she almost deserves to be an old maid--in real life, that is what happens to women who are too clever by half and who are never done with insulting people. No, now I rarely watch this version because its deficiencies are too apparant when cast alongside A&amp;E's remarkably faithful adaptation. See them both, and judge for yourself.",N/A
40976,"As far as I can tell, the only difference between this and the 10th Anniversary Edition is that this one has a different cover. As for the film itself, I find it very enjoyable, especially when it is the Director's Cut version, as it has great additional footage. Now, I know the ending of the film is a bit weird, and the training with Ramirez (Sean Connery) is really weird, but I still gave the film 5 stars because it has a huge fun factor. This movie contains some top notch acting (sure, it's no &quot;Sense &amp; Sensibility&quot;, but at least you won't fall asleep watching it), great fight scenes, great characters, and memorable locations. Many critics complain about the camera angles and cut scenes, but those add to the experience. Frankly, I wonder if these people prefer the static camera angles of soap operas.Anyway, this is the best and only Highlander film worth watching, and it rates better than the TV show. This movie also, in a sense, offers a counter balance to the romantic mythism surrounding vampire-goth films....living forever is not all wine socials and classical piano by the fire. It's really, really lonely.As for the content-story-plot, basically our hero Connor MacLeod is an immortal, who has been living on earth since the 1500's. The time of the Gathering has arrived, where immortal must fight immortal until one remains, becoming god-like in power (a.k.a. gaining the prize). Immortals can only die by having their heads cut off, which means there are sword fights and decapitations for the whole family. It really is a fun movie, and the price is right.Just one last note: it's best to not compare this film to the three &quot;sequels&quot; or the series, as they only vaguely tie together.",Highlander: Director's Cut
671989,"Okay, we all know that sequels tend to be lame.  This one is no exception.  Unfortunately, it's a lame sequel to a lame movie.  Talk about the law of diminishing returns.Producer/director David DeCoteau and screenwriter Matthew Jason Walsh reunite for the second installment of their Brotherhood series.  However, other than recycled sets and recycled themes, there is nothing to connect this movie to The Brotherhood--except actor Forrest Cochran who is theoretically playing the same character, but as I don't remember the character at all in the first movie, it's hard to call it a true connection.As with the first, it is a thrill-less thriller and about as ""straight"" a piece of homoeroticism as you're likely to encounter.Actually, to be fair, the underlying premise of this installment is slightly stronger than the first, even if it isn't related, and the plot is a little more interesting.  However, the execution is weaker.  The acting is adequate, with only Sean Ferris exhibiting any real charisma.  This is unfortunate, as the whole point of the character Luc is supposed to be his incredible charisma, and Forret Cochran doesn't have the presence to pull it off.This time, the story takes place at a private high/prep school, although it appeared to me to be the same location on which the original was shot.  The student body is keep in a perpetual state of anxiety by a quartet of shirtless bullies.  Three outsiders are the primary focus of the bullies.  New student Luc arrives and offers the outsiders a way to get even which involves swimming in their boxer briefs and sitting in a satanic circle while wearing boxer briefs.The quotient of screen time of guys in boxer briefs is higher than the first, and there are two female quasi-leads, doubling the number from the previous installment.  The camera work and the editing is slightly better than the first, but there are still times when DeCoteau would better serve his audience by pulling the camera back and using more fluid editing.It's weak, but what truly appalled me was the amorality of the ending.  As a reviewer, I don't think it's fair for me to give away the ending, and I won't, but I have to admit that it really angered me.  Screenwriter Walsh hasn't thought through the ramifications of his characters' actions, and this left me quite annoyed.Another place where Young Worlocks matches its predecessor is in the lack of any bonus material on the DVD.  The movie is presented in 1.33:1 screen aspect ratio.  As this was probably shot for direct-to-video, I don't know if there was a version with a wider screen aspect ratio. ...(C)2001 Joe Edkin",Brotherhood 2:Young Warlocks VHS
202973,"This pilot film for Rod Serling's final TV endeavor NIGHT GALLERY is a three-part omnibus that is far spookier than most made-for-television projects.  Serling's own morality tracts are here bought together in a delicious mix of suspense, terror, and melodrama.The first story concerns a greedy nephew (Roddy McDowall) who deliberately leaves his uncle exposed (George Macready) open to the cold, so that his death will result in McDowall grabbing onto the family fortune.  But there is a painting in his uncle's vast collection that, bit by little bit, proceeds to drive McDowall to utter madness because of what it depicts--Macready coming back from the grave!Story #2 concerns a blind woman (Joan Crawford, in one of her last roles) who blackmails her doctor (Barry Sullivan) in giving her an occular transplant so that she may see, even if it is only for twelve hours.  The operation is in actuality a success, but when her 5th Avenue penthouse is thrown into darkness because of the great 1965 New York blackout, she's led to believe it was a disaster.Story #3 focuses on a Nazi fugitive (Richard Kiley) eking out an existence in Buenos Aires who becomes entranced by a painting of a fisherman in an art gallery, and who longs for Escape.  But his past is about to catch up to him; and the twist ending is not quite what he had in mind.Superbly scripted by Serling, from his collection of short stories entitled &quot;The Season To Be Wary&quot;, NIGHT GALLERY is superior suspense entertainment.  Boris Sagal and Barry Shear do effective jobs in the direction of the first and third stories, but it is the Crawford segment that gets the most attention--and for good reason.  This marked the maiden directorial effort of a young man from Phoenix, Arizona named Steven Spielberg.Billy Goldenberg's eerie, Herrmann-influenced score puts the capper on this one-of-a-kind TV movie.  With Halloween fast approaching, NIGHT GALLERY is well worth searching for.",N/A
451460,"&quot;The X-Files: Fight the Future&quot; is an endlessly fascinating and complicated movie that ties together all the mythology pieces from the popular series upon which it's based.  Although I think that people who never watch the show can enjoy this movie, I doubt they can understand it very well.  Heck, I watch the show religiously and I still don't think I understand everything.However, it succeeds in introducing the audience to the characters of Agents Mulder and Scully, without rehashing the things that are familiar to the fans of the show.  When we are first introduced to our favorite duo, their conversation on their cell phones is enjoyable to both old audiences and new ones alike.The film also makes clear the deep affection and love Mulder and Scully feel for each other--something regular viewers already know--which comes to a head in the famous hallway scene outside of Mulder's apartment.The film is top quality, as we've come to expect no less from &quot;The X-Files,&quot; with an intelligent story-line, great action sequences and special effects, and plenty of aliens to satisfy the sci-fi junkie in all of us.  But don't get me wrong--you don't have to be a sci-fi junkie to enjoy this film.  You have to like a good suspense/thriller, with some action, intelligent story-telling, and yes, a little bit of hinted-at romance.  I mean, for &quot;The X-Files,&quot; any 'Shipper will tell you that this is a pretty romantic movie.  As one of those so-called 'Shippers, I was very angry at that darn bee, which was my biggest disappointment.The DVD itself is nicely presented, with all the theatrical trailers, an informative commentary track by Rob Bowman and Chris Carter, and an interesting behind-the-scenes look at the making of the film.

541982,"The first part of this review is for those who have not seen this film. The second part is specifically for those who have viewed this film more than once.In this first part I will mention that this film is highly unusual. Even a description of the plot and characters would only be my abstract and subjective opinion. You the viewer, are the final judge as to what actually took place within the story. This movie is that obscure, intricate, illusive, and downright subjective. This is not (not at all) the type of movie that you go into viewing with preconceived ideas--whatever they may be. If you are the type of person who just has to know about a movie before you even watch it, you are doing yourself a grave disservice in this case. Exercise your mind and your comprehension skills and view this film without any foreknowledge, other than the fact that you are in for a special dosage of mental stimulation.I would recommend this film to anyone who enjoys being intellectually challenged. Those of you who are intuitive and sensitive to subtleties, those of you who notice things that others overlook, and those of you who are clever and inventive will love this movie. Detectives, medical professionals, psychologists, sociologists, scientists, mathematicians, and creative professionals, such as writers, will find this film very rewarding.This is certainly the type of film that you will want in DVD. You will have questions that only the extras on the DVD can answer for you. There is also a website set up specifically for admirers of this fantastic movie. If after watching, you can figure out the website address, you are very clever.In this second part I would like to discuss my opinion of what I  believe is an overlooked aspect of the plot and the main character, Leonard. If you think I am on to something, than e-mail me.I have many ideas about how to interpret this film, however I am going to give a very unusual interpretation here, in hopes that there are others out there that, like me, like to think ""out side the box"", so to speak.The way I see it, Leonard is a person who loves to kill. He has been killing prior to meeting this person he refers to as his wife, who is actually not his wife. He uses his memory condition as a contributor to his psychological dysfunction (his need to kill).  He remembers what he needs to remember, and forgets just what he needs to forget. Leonard displays both sociopathic and psychopathic behavior. He surrounds himself with abusive, aggressive individuals who fuel his justification for his heinous actions. Leonard is extremely clever and intelligent, and he is disciplined and systematic to a precision.Leonard was committed to a mental institution prior to meeting his supposed wife--whom he also killed.  There is special meaning to the one tattoo that Leonard can see at all times, ""Remember Sammy Jenkis,"" and it is not because Leonard is Sammy. It is because Sammy is the first person Leonard killed, prior to his incarceration at the mental institution, as this is Leonard's reminder of his purpose in life as a killer. And the real kicker is that Leonard would have everyone believe that his memory condition is a physical handicap, when in fact it is a mental projection produced by his severe psychosis.And the beauty of this film is that it does not matter if my opinions are near fact or far fetched, what matters is that this film allows me to create what reality I would have with it.",Memento VHS

403167,"This is a classic case of trying to hard.In his attempt to create a decidedly off-beat romantic comedy, director/writer/actor Schaeffer has forgotten the basic rules of creating a well structured, engaging plot.&quot;If Lucy Fell&quot; has hilarious -- perhaps even side-splitting moments. But that's all the film has -- a series of disconnected moments, some funny, some just odd -- all lacking in any real cohesiveness.The relationship between Sarah Jessica Parker and Eric Schaeffer's characters is marked by a cold sterility. They are completely without chemistry. What seems to be the director's attempt at creating a friendship beyond words has succeeded only in creating a friendship that loses our interest and causes us to send the remote careening toward our television. In addition, Schaeffer himself is gross and unappealing. We are almost embarassed to watch him desecrate his own attempt at a character.The story's culmination -- the realization of these friends' romantic feelings for one another -- is ridiculous and unearned. The revelation comes out of nowhere, both figuratively and literally. The film's most glaring example of poor writing occurs in a scene where Sarah Jessica Parker's Lucy engages in a monologue -- the movie's only monologue -- in which she suddenly and quite randomly comes to the conclusion that she has always been in love with Schaeffer's character. This event is not influenced by the film's other events, as it would be in any tightly constructed narrative, but materializes out of thin air.The result is an audience left feeling bored and confused.This is a movie w/ great comedic potential. It is too bad the story is far too inaccessible for this potential to be realized.",N/A

It's just that some of them have guns.The cast, especially James Spader and Charlize Theron are top notch, but a crucial change made to &quot;lighten&quot; the movie tosses much of the plot out the window, robs one central character of his key motivation, and greatly hinders the film.

Harrison Ford, on his behalf did exceptionally well, but it must be known that the star of WLB is Michelle Pfeiffer. Since it is centered around her, of course they would show more of her. But this woman is magnificent. Pfeiffer took a middle-aged woman watching her only daugher go off to college and turned her into a woman struggling to discover the truth behind mysterious happenings. The beginning of the movie starts off as any movie would, introducing the characters, and setting up plot points. There's also a false accusation which makes you think the whole movie will be about that one thing, but then an unexpected twist happens. And I loved the way they did that! I won't give away the twist for those of you who haven't had the chance to see WLB. Anyway, the middle is spent with mysterious going ons, and Pfeiffer's character trying to understand what's going on. As soon as she does get a grip on what's going on, she is determined to get to the bottom of the story. Which she does, in the end. I must say, if you see nothing but the end of this movie, you will be blown off the edge of your seat.

The entire film is done with such incredible quality of effects, direction and acting, that it's no wonder this was an immediate cult classic.

456491,"Movies exist to entertain. They entertain by telling a story. Some filmmakers choose to ignore the first part and simply tell a story, one that may not be entertaining but still carries some sort of meaning, some sort of message, some sort of point. Some filmmakers choose to ignore the second part and simply entertain with action scenes, or special effects, or humor. It's a rare and tragic thing when a filmmaker ignores both parts and yet still manages to get a movie made, but Trees Lounge is one of these films-- aimless, pointless, and devoid of any entertainment.In this film, Steve Buscemi (who also wrote and directed this) does a fine job of acting as Tommy, a Long Island resident with no apparent aim in life other than to convince the world that he is the lowest form of human existence. He steals from his employer, he alienates his female childhood friend for the sake of brief sex, he alienates his older friends over the girl, he loses any other jobs he attempts to win, and ultimately his best friend beats him down with a baseball bat and leaves him lying alone in the dirt.And that, friends, is this film. There is no point to it, no reasoning behind it, no logic behind the assumption that we would want to follow this man as he completely ruins everything he touches and ultimately finds himself desolate and alone, hated by his friends, by his employer, and by us, the audience.

120566,"Is a guy who has killed seventeen people necessarily a &#65533;bad&#65533; guy?  Not a question everybody is going to have to ask themselves, to be sure, but what if that guy moved in next door to you?  It&#65533;s a situation that just may induce an introspective moment or two.  Which is exactly what happens in &#65533;The Whole Nine Yards,&#65533; directed by Jonathan Lynn and starring Bruce Willis and Matthew Perry.  Hit-man Jimmy &#65533;The Tulip&#65533; Tudeski (Willis) ratted out his boss in Chicago, and now he&#65533;s on the lam.  He makes his way to Canada, where he buys a house next door to a hapless dentist, Nicholas &#65533;Oz&#65533; Oseransky (Perry), who is suffering from inherited debts and a shrew of a wife, Sophie (Rosanna Arquette), not to mention a mother-in-law from Hell (Carmen Ferland).  When he realizes who his neighbor is about to be, his first instinct is to run, but Sophie has other ideas.  It seems there&#65533;s a price on Jimmy&#65533;s head; one Janni Gogolack (Kevin Pollak) would like to take his revenge on the guy who&#65533;s responsible for his father going away for a long, long time.  So Sophie squeezes Oz into a corner until he agrees to go to Chicago and meet with Janni to put the finger on Jimmy.  Not a great idea, Oz thinks, but it at least sounds like a nice vacation, so he goes.  But, of course, he should have stayed with his instincts, because he soon finds himself looking down the barrel of trouble.  And the only way out, it seems, is down...What Lynn put together here is actually a fairly light-hearted, black comedy; the nature of the story dictates that there will be violence in it, and there is, but much of it is implied rather than graphic.  The pace is good, and Lynn develops the characters enough to let you know exactly who they are and what they are all about.  There&#65533;s not a lot of depth, but it&#65533;s not necessary; the actors have each made their respective characters unique to a point that puts them beyond stereotype, and it works perfectly for this film and the story.  Some of what happens is inevitable, though not necessarily predictable, and certain aspects will keep you guessing right up to the end.  Typical of a comedy that leans to the dark side, nothing in this story is cut and dried.Willis is perfect as Jimmy The Tulip, giving a rather reserved, subtle performance that puts Jimmy&#65533;s guarded but confident manner into perspective.  Underneath it all, this guy is really rather cold-blooded (he has to be, given his choice of employment), but his relationship with Oz gives it some warmth, at least externally.  Like Chow Yun-Fat in &#65533;The Killer,&#65533; Jimmy is likable, but when you consider at arm&#65533;s length who he is  and what he is capable of, it&#65533;s a bit disconcerting.  And that&#65533;s one of the aspects of the film that is so interesting-- because you know who and what Jimmy is, you never really know which way things are going to turn.Perry is excellent, as well, as &#65533;Oz.&#65533;  Henpecked and in dire straits, he is something of an updated version of the W.C. Fields character in &#65533;It&#65533;s A Gift&#65533; or &#65533;The Bank Dick,&#65533; although a bit darker.  Perry is charismatic, has impeccable timing with his delivery and uses physical comedy to great effect.  His reactions to Willis and the situations in which he finds himself are brilliant and hilarious, and he seems to instinctively know just how far to take it to make it work.  And it&#65533;s the little, seemingly insignificant things he brings to the character that give the film that extra something and creates some memorable moments.The supporting cast includes Michael Clarke Duncan (Frankie Figs), Natasha Henstridge (Cynthia), Amanda Peet (Jill St. Claire), Harland Williams (Special Agent Hanson) and Serge Christianssens (Mr. Boulez).  It may not be the most original movie ever made, but &#65533;The Whole Nine Yards&#65533; is funny, has a great cast of actors who have taken characters you&#65533;ve basically seen before and made them their own, and does exactly what a film like this is supposed to do:  Entertain.  It&#65533;s not going to make you ponder the universe or the state of the world today, but it&#65533;s going to give you a couple of hours of laughs and some residual chuckles.

As you may surmise, I really like this movie.",Le Grand Chemin VHS

211443,"When Friday The 13th hit theatres, and wheeled in a magnificent 25,000,000 dollars at the box office, it was quite obvious there would be a sequel, and some might think that's a bad thing.  Because of the originality, and horror, of the first film, this one has a lot to live up to.  And it, surprisingly, does this very well!!!  I think that this one beats the original by far.  Instead of just the stalking and the killing, there's a lot more action in this one, and a lot more fighting.  We also have a much brighter heroine, who plays her charecter to the hilt, Ginny (Amy Steel, April Fool's Day), and the rest of the cast is much more 3 dimensional than in the first film.  The setting is also a lot more creepy this time around, and the murders are even more creative and just a bit less gory.  Producer/Director Steve Miner (Friday The 13th Part 3, House, Forever Young, Halloween H20 20 Years Later) helped make this sequel what it is.  He is quite good at horror films, and he is propably the man responsible for how scary this one is.The film picks up two months after the horror of the first film, and we see Alice, our heroine from the first having a nightmareo f that awful night.  After a shower, she opens up her refrigerator, and sees a horrible sight.....  The film jumps to five years later, where we see a new group of counselors seeting up right next to Camp Crystal Lake.  The owner, Paul Holt, gives a chilling story about the legend of Jason Voorhees, who was presumed to have drowned in the same lake, although his body was never recovered.  Jeff and Sandra decide to go and check the camp out, even though they don't know what's there, a strange, mysterious creature lurking in the bushes and waiting to strike. That night a group of counselors go out to town, while others stay at the camp.  The particular date is Friday, June 13th, a very unlucky day,as the counselors will soon find out.......Part 2 of this series just might be the very best.  There's a bit more comedy in this entry, and that helps the film a lot, but doesn't take away the terror and the horror of the killer.I would highley reccomend Friday The 13th Part 2, as well as Parts 1, 3, and 4.  They are all classics in my book!!!!!",Friday the 13th 2 VHS

This movie had terrible acting (if you want to call it acting), a predictable plot that a bunch of drunks probably got together to make, and just lacked in everything from dialouge to action.

I enjoyed this movie, in that, I was not able to figure it out until everything was revealed.  A splendid movie!  I will be seeing this again before it leaves the theatres.",The Others
522396,"The inferior sequel rears its ugly head yet again.  Classic John Woo action is the only thing that makes this movie.  Other than that, there is nothing else that you will find remarkable.First of all, the surprises, twists and turns and shocks of the first movie are just completely left out in this movie.  You never would have expected some of the events in the first one to happen, but they did.  In this film, you see everything coming a mile away.  The very few scenes that are intended to be shocking or surprising are too blatantly obvious to deliver the effect.The plot suffers from misdirection and boredom.  With a cheesy love sub-plot thrown into a story about a killer virus that a former IMF agent is eager to get his hands on, there isn't much you'll find enjoyable or engrossing.  Missing the suspense of the original, you won't need to think or try to put two and two together.  And once again, a renegade IMF agent is the villain.  What is it with these guys?  Do they go evil after they have one too many missions?  Everything is pretty much right there on a platter.The action is classic John Woo, but becomes way too unbeleivable to be appreciated.  Ethan Hunt has accuracy with his gun that would make the Terminator jealous, and pulls off stunts that are just a bit too over-the-top for my tastes.  I also didn't know that they make guns with unlimited ammo nowadays.  Throughout the whole movie, you will see Ethan Hunt reload his gun no more than one time.  The motorcycle and driving stunts are done fairly well, but again, become too unbeleivable to be appreciated.  Last time I checked, Ethan Hunt was an IMF agent, not Neo from the Matrix.Overall, if you want some mindless action and crazy stunts, then you might enjoy this movie.  However, if you enjoyed the first movie, you will probably find that this sequel is going to fall short of expectations.  The film moves slowly, and the end fight drags on way too much, at which point you will be asking yourself 'when is it gonna end?'  Unfortunately, M:I2 does not live up to the hype, or the lofty expectations of the original.",N/A
559765,"The problem with most reality programming is that they don't ground their shows in reality.  They always devise a theme to place them outside of everyday challenges, be they sent to boot camp, on a love cruise, or on a desert island to eat the vermin of the tropics.This is where the Real World comes in handy; free from such marketing gimmicks, the show displays human relationships, character dynamics, and the honest emotions of its various casts in a show that's okay to love, because none of it is fiction.  Presented here is the show's greatest season, more diverse, better developed, and just plain more intriguing than the constant squabbling of the other seasons (a flaw in the program not present in the New Orleans season).  Julie is a woman of newfound wisdom; watching her grow and thrive with the lessons of the experience is a constant pleasure, as she is never as innocent as she appears.  Melissa is always a treat, never afraid to speak her mind and, just as often, her body.  Matt's devout adherence to his Catholic faith did not prevent him from enjoying the diversity and wisom of his roommates or the experience itself.  David, a loner, held great ambition in his silence, and a dedication to his ill mother back home.  Jamie, smug but lovable, learned much about seeing value in others, and himself.  Best of all was Danny, a man of warmth and wisdom, whose loving relationship with military boyfriend Paul, his quietly powerful love for roommate Kelly, and his teaching of Julie about the truths of his orientation revealed a far more complex person than the stereotypical effeminate, promiscuous image of gay men held in common prejudice.  Yes, the show is something for MTV to be proud of, not only true reality, but deeply felt as well.The DVD release decides to take the humorous route, and it is truly juicy material, both human and hilarious at once.  The entire feature is filled to bursting of laugh-out-loud sequences of moments both embarrassing and revealing, including Kelly and Danny's uncommon familiarity with each other (Adam and Eve were never this insatiable), Melissa's painfully funny commentary on sex, her body, and her parents (Mercy is profoundly remeniscent of the mother Margaret Cho made famous).  The inclusion of the cast members' audition tapes make this a terrific package, a must for fans of the show.Just don't abuse the On-star people like that.",N/A

571512,"Our family just watched this video and it was one of the best, I think!  Esther was good, but I missed the Silly Song, and the wonderful humor that has become so characteristic of Veggie Tales.Remember when Jimmy and Jerry Gourd decided to take over the show?  Well, in this episode Archibald Asparagus tries to put some class into the story - the story is &quot;Omelet&quot; bearing strong resemblance to &quot;Hamlet&quot;.  Adults, listen carefully - there are MANY hilarious allusions to Shakespeare in this segment!The &quot;Silly Song with Larry&quot; was &quot;Classic Song with Larry&quot; - just as hilarious, though!The theme of the whole video is sharing and the main story, about Lyle, a Viking who does not enjoy the pillaging and plundering that seems to be part of being a Viking.  Instead, Lyle (played by Junior Asparagus) goes out and gives the small bag of loot that the others give him back to the people, along with his handmade potholders!  It is very touching and very funny at the same time.The music for this most recent Veggie video was OUTSTANDING!  Songs that will definitely stick in your head.  Extremely creative, very well-produced, and lots of fun.  Not to mention having the lesson of the importance of sharing.Please do not think that these Veggie Tales videos are just for kids!  Indeed, children would not pick up on a lot of the humor -Big Idea has really found something that appeals to children and adults alike.  The group that watched the video tonight consisted of 2 40-somethings, 2 21-year-olds, and an 18 year old.

98464,"Though they tried and tried and tried, this is the best of the set.  Great setting, using a positively magic city as backdrop (coincidence that this and Bullitt, the two best cop films of the era were both set in San Francisco? I think not).This film alone (even if Harrys 2,3,and 4 were never shown) made the persona of one of the most memorable characters in American film. This film was also helped by one of the best/worst bad guy of all the Dirty Harry films (Andy Robinson). He was so bad that even after he paid to be brutally beaten there was still the feeling that he did not get enough (reinforced by the great Dirty Harry line: You know I didn't do it 'cause he looked too damned good&quot;)  Wonderful dark humor, shared by all characters. A tense thriller. We knew folks were going to get murdered (otherwise, how could we set him up as a bad guy?), but there was still tension when we looked through Scorpio's rifle scope.Well acted all around. A tight screenplay that leaves no time for gaps (another reason this is a hard movie to break up for broadcast television). Definitely worth having.",N/A
432607,"REVIEW:  HALLOWEENBREAKDOWN-----------------------------CHARACTER: *****- For a horror movie, this movie is at the top of its game with characters.  They are interesting and intriguing, and even if some of Laurie&#65533;s friends are a little annoying or shallow, just think to high school: they were like that.  Dr. Loomis pastes the purpose of the movie together, not just making it bland or generic.ASTHETICS: *****(This includes acting, music, and setting&#65533; just stuff that delights the ear and eyes.)- The setting and mood was excellent. The music is the best of any horror movie, and John Carpenter should be extremely proud of his little piano notes.  They keep you attentive.  The makeup is good, and it has a homey feel.FAST FORWARD: *****- A star is lost (of 5) for each time I find myself fast forwarding in boredom.INSTINCTIVE: ****(This is the rating I&#65533;d give right at the end given what my overall impression of the movie is.)- I really enjoyed the second half, but I thought that the beginning was very slow.  Anyone used to the wham-bam movement of violence is going to be slightly bored, waiting for violence.  But it sure keeps the suspense!-----------------------------OVERALL: ***** (rounded)RECOMMENDED: Yes.",N/A
503578,"Waking Ned Devine has made me a foreign film addict.  The delightful shenanigans of the two central characters as they attempt to involve an entire Irish hamlet in a scheme to cash in on the winning lottery ticket of a deceased friend was almost as classic as a keystone cops routine.  The plight of a small dying community in a world of big cities is hardly unfamiliar to me having spent some of my earlier years in a similar community in southern Minnesota.  The formulaic activities of the elderly, left behind by the flight of the younger generation to the cities, is definitely illustrated, as are the narrow choices available to those young people who have chosen to remain in their native town.  My favorite scenes are the motorcycle ride by the two elderly comrades through the backroads to beat the lottery agent to the winner's home, and the race of the village grump to the phone box to report the fraud.  The scenery was totally gorgeous and almost makes me want to board an Aer Lingus for Ireland.",Waking Ned Devine VHS

522375,"Honestly, ask yourself that question.  How long was it?If you speed up all the slow motion scenes to normal speed, I'm banking on the movie being, say, 20 minutes long.Yep, John Woo is back proving that a good film is about 400 bullets to kill one guy and every single trigger squeeze has to be captured artistically so that you can see the little hairs on the guys finger blowing in the wind caused by a superb motorcycle spin.It's visually stunning...and unfortunately detracting from story and character development.As Ethan Hunt lays out the possible evil plot behind Chimera and Ving Rhames asks if it really could be that simple, Ethan Hunt replies, &quot;Why not?&quot;  I was sitting in the theater hoping, &quot;Please don't make it that simple.&quot;But it is and there are absolutely no plot surprises or twists beyond the ordinary.Oh, and the dove...there it is again, Woo, I just don't know HOW you do it every single time.I read a review in a newspaper where a critic said that everyone was ripping masks off in this film so often that he felt that he was watching an episode of Scooby Doo.Dead right...and don't give this film any more credit than Scooby Doo (in slow motion) deserves.",N/A

344398,"Kurosawa and Shakespeare are a winning combination.  With &quot;Throne of Blood,&quot; Kurosawa strips Macbeth to the bare bones of plot, then packs on new flesh in the form of scheming ambition in feudal Japan.In this version, Washizu (Macbeth) is somewhat simple, and content with what comes his way, be it castle or fort, honor or deceit.  His wife, the infamous Lady Macbeth, is chillingly calm and dangerous.  She has no interest in her husband's contentment, and knows that the only way to advance her position is to advance the position of her husband, by whatever means necessary.  Her role as the spider is particularly suited to the halls of the Cobweb Castle.The acting and filming are up to the quality that one expects from Kurosawa and Mifune.  The pacing of the film is full of dynamic contrasts, going from heart-pounding action to patient silence.  This film is not spoon-fed to you, but demands your concentration.  The visuals are particularly stunning in &quot;Throne of Blood.&quot;  The cobweb forest is haunting, and the single weird sister, all in white spinning in a white cage,  maintains the same chilling calmness of Washizu's wife.One of the many nice touches of &quot;Throne of Blood&quot; is the chance to see that Samurai at the height of their power.  These are not the poor, struggling warriors of &quot;Seven Samurai&quot; or &quot;Yojimbo.&quot;  Washizu is decked out in full armor for the bulk of the film, and his castle is defended and attacked by well-dressed armies.  Each lord is powerful and wields mighty forces.Oh, and of course, the big finish.  All I can say is wow.",N/A
259427,"Fans of British comedy will be familiar with Roy Clarke (&quot;Keeping Up Appearances,&quot; &quot;Open All Hours,&quot; and &quot;The Last of the Summer Wine&quot;), who wrote the screenplay.  If you enjoy Clarke's distinctive, zany brand of British humour, you will enjoy this film.  The actual storyline (and soundtrack) were written by Barry Gibb (The Bee Gees), but the humour is all Roy Clarke.  Lest anyone be shocked or offended, however, I should mention that this is not the family entertainment one normally expects from Clarke.  The film is restricted and frequent use is made of the &quot;F&quot; word.  Also, there are a few sexual references and about 5 minutes of nudity as the &quot;sights&quot; of Amsterdam's red-light district are explored.  It's actually quite tame really; one sees far worse on Masterpiece Theatre (except for the swearing).  I did think it worth mentioning, however, just so one knows what to expect.Briefly, the film is about an English solicitor (Timothy Dalton) and an American footballer (Anthony Edwards) who have terminal cancer and decide to spend their remission in the brothels of Amsterdam.  The humour, being typically British, requires an extremely high level of competence in order to carry it off.  Dalton and actress Janet McTeer have just such ability and do a superb job portraying their respective characters.  McTeer is the real show-stealer--she's just hilarious.  I was not, I must confess, impressed with Anthony Edwards' acting (which appeared, unfortunately, to be just that).  Nevertheless, the other actors more than compensate, making this an enjoyable film all around.All in all, the humour and poignancy (which is never mawkish) are skilfully interwoven, and the film is (for the most part) very well acted.  The result is a delightful, entertaining film (with a running time of 105 minutes).  Recommended to fans of British humour, and especially to fans of Roy Clarke.",N/A

Sam (Tom Hanks) and Annie (Meg Ryan) don't meet until the last scene, but who cares?  Their uncertain journey to true romance is fun to watch.  Additional things to like are the surprisingly effective performance of young Ross Malinger as Jonah and Rob Reiner's hilarious performance in a small part.  All that popular music from the '40s and '50s is a definite plus.  It all leaves you with a mellow glow inside, similar to the golden sunset reflected off the New York skyline.  Recommended for multiple romantic viewing.  To the guys reading this, trembling with trepidation about now, don't worry, there is enough laugh-out-loud comedy to keep you from feeling as if you want to decorate, or something.

16095,"First let me say that this movie gets slammed way to hard by everyone.  Not just Movie Critics, but by the common people too, even me.  take this example for instance.  I have &quot;With Nails : The Film Diaries of Richard E. Grant&quot; in my bookshelf, and my housemate at the time was checking out my room because he just moved in.  He saw the book and we started talking about the movies Richard has done, then Hudson Hawk came up.  I shot it down and talked about how it &quot;borrowed&quot; from John Woo's &quot;Once a Thief&quot;.  But I was perplexed as to why there is someone with somewhat good taste praising this movie.  I rented it and saw it for a second time, and I loved it.  So you should do the same.It's about a world famous cat burglar (as if there was any other kind) played by Bruce Willis in one of his best roles.  He goes by Hudson Hawk and is just getting done with his prison time.  The Hawk meets up with his old buddy (the annoying Danny Aiello who I will try not to bring up anymore in this review) and makes an attempt at leading a normal life.  But alas he is pulled back into &quot;the life&quot; for one more crime.  To steal a work of art that is about to be auctioned off.  He and his buddy (ugh) pull it off, and life goes on.  But looking at the paper, it's as though the theft never happened, so the Hawk goes to the auction and we meet Andie McDowell (How come she and Danny get jobs in Hollywood and I don't?  I'm better looking and have more character and charisma than them, but then so do rocks), and we meet the Mayflowers as well (Richard E Grant and Sandra Bernhart in their best roles ever) and after that hilarity ensues.  We meet some crazy CIA operatives, the pope watching Mr Ed, Lee Marvin as a rogue CIA agent, a butler that would give Oddjob a run for his money, some great song and dance routines, and a few twists before twists became trendy.I know that you have some little part of you that wants to see this, otherwise you wouldn't have gotten this far in the review.  It's written and directed by the same guy that brought you Heathers, so you know it's smart and witty, unlike most the other movies Bruce did through the early and mid 90's, anyone remember Striking Distance?  Richard E Grant (buy his book) is great as always and so is Sandra.  The only downside is Danny and Andie are in it.  Maybe the producer owed them a favor or lost a bet.  Who knows?  If you watch it again and hate it, let me know, my email address is on this website if you see more about me.

Those of you who don't want your virgin eyes spoiled by knowing what the movie is about (like anyone doesn't know by now) should not read what follows, because it is a long list of everything WRONG with the movie--not counting the fact that the (supposedly mind-blowingly original) concept behind it has been done by countless sci-fi movies and books for decades--and I may accidentally drop a few hints as to the nature of the plot of this, um, flick.1. The Oracle.  It's stupid, it makes no sense, and it has nothing to do with anything.2. The fact that Neo comes back to life when Trinity kisses him.  I mean, come ON, can't we think of anything cleverer than THAT?3. The idea of getting energy from humans, forgetting the fact that you'd have to put more energy into them than you'd get out.4. Beings that control all aspects of your perception using fallible, killable agents that (mostly) obey the laws of physics, when they could just make you think an anvil fell on your head and crushed you.5. The fact that unplugging someone causes them to die, rather than simply to come out of the matrix.  Isn't that what happened to Neo when he took the pill anyway?6. Telephones. This was the most irritating thing in the entire movie.  WHY, may I ask, is it necessary to pick up a telephone to emerge from this virtual universe?7. If deja vu is when there's a glitch and &quot;they&quot; reset something, shouldn't everyone get it at the same time?8. The ripply-helicopter-building-crash thing.

However, the story is much easier to understand and flows better. The VHS copy does no justice compared to the high quality of the anamorphic transfer. It was almost like I was watching it for the first time again. Hats off to the production team that created this well, masterpiece. I couldn't really see the detail in the VHS copy but from the foreground, background and the character animations, this is ALL cell animation! Very little CG! Very, very high quality work here. The story is deep and complex so be ready to be confused watching this for the first time. There are so many different smaller stories and plot twists going on that it can be hard to keep up with on your first sitting. The english dubbed soundtrack is remastered in Dolby 5.1 and was done very well considering that this movie is over 10 years old now. Purists beware since new foley has been added in addition to the original mix and none of the voice actors are the same as in the VHS english dubbed version. Gunfire and explosions were most prominent to me on the first viewing as sounding different and there are additional foley effects added but I liked it. I thought it hightened the realism and why not take advantage of all the improvements that current technology has to offer?

26280,"In an interview shown on this massive Criterion 3-disc set, director Terry Gilliam -- incidentally, a pretty fun guy just to listen to and watch -- states that his inspiration for Brazil came from his imagining a solitary man sitting a beach of coal listening to the pop song Brazil, which the movie is named for. Visualize this image, and one can get an accurate impression of what the movie's all about. An alienated everyman, frustrated by corporate-like enslavement, has only his fantasies to rise above the paperwork that chains him down day-to-day. Sometimes characterized as a 1984 for pseduo-intellectuals, this movie shouldn't be taken as seriously as Orwell's novel, but still serves as an entertaining, colorful meditation on many of the same themes found in that book.Right off the bat, the viewer might be stunned or taken aback at the amount of props, knickknacks, scenery and imagery that Gilliam stuffs into each scene. The possibility that this might overwhelm some viewers might account for why some people find the film difficult to follow. It really isn't -- I had a difficult time on my first viewing only because the deteriorated tape that I rented had such muddied sound that I could barely hear the dialogue. It's a godsend that a company like Criterion would take time out of their busy quest of resurrecting foreign masterpieces to put out such a comprehensive set as this. The amount of extras and supplemental material on this is staggering, but spending $60 on any unfamiliar film is stupid -- rent Brazil first and then decide if you want the royal treatment.",N/A

414911,"Esther Costello (Heather Sears) is a young girl playing with her friends in rural post World War II Ireland. She and her friends enter an abandoned home and in the basement discover a cache of live grenades. Not knowing the danger, they begin fighting over them and pull the pin out of one of the grenades. As Esther hears her mother above calling for her, the grenade goes off, setting off an explosion that kills her mother. Esther undergoes severe psychological trauma that renders her blind, deaf, and mute. She ends up living with an uncaring, slovenly grandmother in her impoverished rural hovel, dirty, uneducated, and uncared for.Enter Margaret Landi, a wealthy American, who is touring Ireland in search of her Irish roots, when she comes upon a teenage Esther. Estranged from her scoundrel of a husband, Carlo (Rossano Brazzi), and childless, Maargaret is moved by the entreaties of the local parish priest to help Esther. Though at first resistant, she is finally moved by Esther herself into taking her with her. She now becomes to Esther, what Annie Sullivan was to Helen Keller, and under Margaret's care and ministrations Esther responds and thrives. A light bulb goes on in Esther's formerly dark and lonely world.Esther's story and plight ultimately captures the heart of those who hear it, and a charitable foundation is established. This foundation becomes recognized world wide and is big business, making Margaret and Esther the functional equivalents of televangelists, such is the fervor that they create wherever they go. Moreover, the money comes pouring in. This causes Margaret's estranged husband, Carlo, to come back into Margaret's life and not for the better. Carlo is nothing more than a handsome, smooth talking hustler.Carlo brings a business partner with him and finagles Margaret into letting them handle the business. Margaret, who is clearly overworked, turns over the reins of the foundation to him. Her husband and his partner end up swindling the foundation. By the time Margaret realizes what is going on, the damage is done. Carlo has also put the moves on the now nubile and lovely Esther and ends up sexually assaulting her. When Margaret discovers what Carlo did to Esther, it puts her over the top, and she takes matters into her own hand. With her world tumbling down around her, Margaret meets Carlo and ensures that neither she nor Esther will ever be hurt by Carlo again. In the interim, Esther discovers that every cloud does, indeed, have a silver lining.This is a terrific film, which garnered a British Film Academy Award for Joan Crawford as Best Actress for 1957. Her portrayal of Margaret Landi is compelling and moving. Newcomer Heather Sears gives a wonderful performance as Esther Costello, a difficult role. She is able to silently convey to the viewer what she is feeling. Rossano Brazzi, as the dog of a husband, is on the money, and the entire supporting cast give strong performances, making this a film to see. Fans of Joan Crawford will enjoy this film, as will anyone who likes a well made, well acted, though somewhat schmaltzy, drama.",Story of Esther Costello VHS
554523,"This is truly an epic gem.  A film that not only chronicles a portion of Father Damien's life, but also captures his undying devotion to God.  In a grand way, it is Father Damien's story of selflessly helping those people who were strickened with the terrible disease of leprosy.  In it's quieter moments, it is a reflection of the lives who were touched by the kindness of one man and uplifted by his neverending faith in God.The film is masterfully photographed by Nino Martinetti and poetically directed by Paul Cox.  With a screenplay by John Briley (Oscar winner for Gandhi) and a brilliant cast featuring David Wenham, Kris Kristofferson, Peter O'toole, Aden Young, Sam Neil, Derek Jacobi, Kate Ceberano and the list goes on.

The plot ostensibly centers around a schoolteacher who recruits several women to attack Drug Lord Peter Lawford (in a quaalude and alcohol inspired performance) and his right-hand man Jack Palance.  Along the way a few washed-up TV &quot;stars&quot; are thrown in:  Alan &quot;Dhoo&quot; Hale Jr as a manager (&quot;what could you possibly need from an Alan Hale Jr&quot; is Mike's comment), Pat Butrum as his annoying Green Acres character selling vans (hey it IS the '70s), and the one true talent Jim Backus as a militia commander (The MST3K crew are actually sympathetic to Backus'.  There's plenty of nauseating performances left here to riff on.) Ostensibly that's the plot:  the REAL plot is to have seven braless women run around as much as possible in various jumpsuits and bikinis.  Mike's comment, &quot;This movie offends one cell animals&quot; sums it up nicely. The '70s beg to be riffed, and the timeframe combined with an INCREDIBLY badly-acted movie make for one of the best MST3ks done during Mike Nelson's reign. If you lived through the 70s, like I did, the hair and clothes will start you laughing.  If you didn't, well, yes people really did dress like that-unselfconsciously.  It's a hoot, pick it up.

410129,"Finally - justice, of a sort.  I'd like to take this moment to thank Michael Bay for his commentary on THE ROCK - CRITERION COLLECTION for admitting, with a laugh, that there really was no logical reason for the boiler under Alcatraz to both be operational AND on fire - it's this kind of moment in the commentary on this special edition that makes this whole package both entertaining and very fun.  CRITERION strikes again with yet another well packed, sharp looking DVD set that is a must for collectors of film.  While THE ROCK may never win awards, it still manages to win over new fans and old fans all the time.  And CRITERION has done their best again to bring the most to this DVD set.  I drop this one star simply because the second disc, while option filled, has its soft spots that feel a little padded to fill out the disc.  The outakes on the disk are few, and most feature Ed Harris in a fit trying to get his military double speak in line and on camera.  Both Cage and Connery make the outakes, but only have two each - and in one they share the screen.  But the AMC MOVIE MAGIC episode is included, as well as a short (but interesting) history of Alcatraz, plus Navy Seal weapons training (where I learned how to clean, fire, reload, and hold a gun with such detail that I feel I may have learned too well).  An interview with Michael Bay is included as well - which is informative.  Disc one does feature the audio commentary and is entertaining and always interesting.  Film image is crisp, sharp and very clean.  And the sound, with the right system, is snappy, fresh and very much a living thing.  THE ROCK - C.C. is a must buy for anyone who enjoyed the movie - and for those who found it fun in passing, this edition will win you over again.",The Rock VHS
542511,"Scary Movie 2 proves that the Wayans's never run out of spoofs/jokes that are absolutely hilarious. Like in Scary Movie (2000), few jokes fall flat, and most succeed.This time, the opening scene is The Exorcist spoof, with Natasha Lyonne, Andy Richter, and James Woods. James Woods and Andy Richter do a &quot;laughably&quot; good job, while Natasha Lyonne is pretty funny as &quot;Regan.&quot; Only one thing, like in Scary Movie, this part of the movie has nothing to do with the rest.The rest of the movie entirely spoofs the Haunting.

Newcomers include Theo(Kathleen Robertson), Alex (Tori Spelling), Professor Oldman (Tim Curry), and Chris Elliot's character, Hanson, the caretaker of Hell House (where most of the movie takes place), who has disgustingly small hands (it's sick what he does with them, but also funny!). Anyway, the story follows the Haunting, where they're all taken to the House, and all Hell breaks loose. A hell of a lot of jokes, that is. I won't give any away, but if you've seen Scary Movie, you should expect Scary Movie 2 to be just as crude, sick, and vulgar as the original.Like Scary Movie, Scary Movie 2 is the most outrageous comedy of the summer.

It is the first time that I see dark violet bars instead of dark ones on a widescreen version of a film. And we can also see that the negative for the picture has quite aged over the years. A little restorating job would have been welcomed here.That the quality of the picture isn't top-notch can be forgiven, but the sound is so bad at times that I can't pass this one up.

534759,"I really enjoyed this movie. At the beginning of the movie you're shown the type of person Tom Hanks character is. And then when he's stranded on the desert island the two people just seem totally opposite, and that's a pretty cool effect. He is a workaholic typer person living a very fast paced life one minute, and then the next he's stranded with nothing trying to survive. The performance by Tom Hanks is very very good as well. It's just him obviously, but it never gets boring. Through much of the island scenes there isn't much talking, but watching his gradual progress on the island is just captivating. Throughout his time on the island you can gradually see his sanity beginning to crack, but always he manages to hold on with his picture of the woman he loves. The caracter Wilson, appropriately named, is pretty silly in a way, but you really find watching the movie that you begin to see &quot;him&quot; as a real character and not an inanimate vollyball. The scene where Tom Hanks character loses Wilson is very good. When you look at the fact that he kicks up such a fuss over losing a vollyball it's hard to feel anything, but it's the idea that he loses his only companion, his friend for all his time on the island that is the idea there. Anyways, then he is rescued and is returned to his home. The scene with him lying on the floor in his hotel room turning the light on and off looking at the picture is absolutely beautiful. It really shows the effect that the island had on him. He's home, but yet he's still the person he was on the island. The highlight of the film however is the meeting with him and the woman he loves. The tension, confusion, anticipation, etc, is all there, and it really pulls the viewer on emotionally as well. The movie ends with Tom Hanks standing at a crossroads, and he smiles. There is still hope even though his life was stripped away.All in all, this movie is beautiful, and very very good. It takes the viewer through so many emotions, that it's hard not to lose yourself in the film. Oh, and the scene where the plane goes down is totally intense, I almost forgot about that. Anyways, check this movie out, you definately won't be dissapointed.",N/A

661185,"Some people have hated this DVD, most actually, and a handful have been able to see the good points in this obviously flawed feature. No doubt, there was some false advertising involved, but it's really only the point that it has been referred to as an ALL NEW FEATURE. I've tried to write this review so many times, but it's always too long to be posted, so I'm going to cut to the chase with this attempt, so here goes. First, you HAVE to see the House of Mouse TV show before watching this Christmas special in order to appreciate it. If you had ever seen it you would have known exactly what to expect. Disney even provides us with the premiere episode as an extra on this DVD, of course that still means you have to buy it first. But I do suggest you watch that premiere episode before the feature anyway. In fact, it's actually better than the feature, not counting the wonderful Mickey's Christmas Carol segment. There are 3 other extras on this DVD by the way, two sing a longs, and a really unnecessary and short look into cartoon sound effects. As for the feature, the other reviewers aren't giving you the entire details when they say there is hardly any new footage. The new footage is probably equal to the old, or almost anyway. There are two &quot;new&quot; cartoons, along with the new wraparound footage, which is where you get to see all the Disney characters hanging out and sometimes performing, in Mickey's nightclub. They are never in the main cartoons, but they usually, especially in the regular episodes of the show, do get a good amount of screen time. It's just that they want to show you so many characters that few of them really get that much to do. The joy is seeing all of them together, period. For some Disney fans that alone is a wonderful treat. The two new cartoons are a new Donald Duck short involving some snowplay, that may seem like an old cartoon since we have often seen Donald and the boys in the snow in the past, and a really great Disney version of the Nutcracker with Narrator John Cleese. The two old cartoons are the classic Pluto's Christmas Tree, and the classic Mickey's Christmas Carol. Personally, even though I have them both on previous videos, it's great to get them on DVD in my opinion, and any true Disney fan should agree with me! True, I'd like to see Mickey's Christmas Carol get it's own DVD release though, so I can get the wonderful credits too. Overall, this DVD is really not that bad. It's flaws are the fact that not enough people are familiar with the House of Mouse series to know just who stars in the toons and who is just window dressing, and that the wraparound plot about getting snowed in and Donald being a Humbug are forced at you within the first minute of the show, which sets you off on a bad pace because it's so badly done. Oh, and that little matter of advertising as being &quot;ALL NEW.&quot; I, for one, expected this DVD to be great because I admit, I ALSO thought it would be all new, not to mention Mickey's Once Upon A Christmas, which came out on DVD two years ago, WAS all new and was great. Also, I had seen House of Mouse. After finally buying it though, I WAS disappointed in the quality of the opening, and that there was less new footage than expected, but I still am glad I bought it. It's well worth it for the old Classics AND the two new cartoons, including the bonus House of Mouse premiere. But for what it turned out to be, it IS overpriced. It should be more in the range of 14.99, while I couldn't find it cheaper than 19.99. Well, if you still think you want to get it, I DO recommend it. If you are unsure, stick with the fairly recent Mickey's Once Upon A Christmas. It's ALL NEW and it's very good. But this is still straight to video folks, please stop being upset that you're not getting BIG SCREEN animation quality! I mean, grow up, that's not going to happen!

Ray Milland stars as Don Birnam who is trying to stay dry.  His girlfriend, played by Jane Wyman, has enlisted the help of Don's brother and for a while, Don deals with his situation.  But slowly and surely, his demons get the best of him and he heads down to his local watering hole and goes on a bender.  The decent of Don into his alcoholic hell is probably the most terrifying and griping portrayals of alcoholism ever committed to the screen.  Mr. Milland is absolutely brilliant and he avoids overplaying the role.  He could have easily hammed it up by over emoting, but he goes to just the right level without ever going over the line.  Mr. Milland took home the 1945 Best Actor Oscar in addition to Mr. Wilder's Best Director and Writing Awards and the film won for Best Picture.

62469,"I expected something more from this film. Meryl Streep is always good, so she cannot be faulted. She plays a housewife and mother who adores happiness and doing things that are kind and good and loves to be the housewife. She becomes ill with cancer, and her semi-distant daughter, played by Ren&eacute;e Zellweger, comes home to take care of her. The problem here is that Zellweger is not believable in this role. She is supposed to be a hard-hearted and aggressive New York magazine reporter. She supposedly has a reputation as being very cold and heartless, but she does not give this character any convincing hardness. It is hard to picture Zellweger in any kind of role like that. She is just too sweet. She sometimes rolls her eyes and gets impatient with things, but she just looks too sweet and compassionate to make us believe that she could ever be an aggressive go-getter. William Hurt is Streep's husband and Zellweger's father. She idolised him and during her tenure as her mother's nurse, she learns a lot of unsavoury things about him. The film is very much about her coming to terms with her illusions about the family and what she felt about them. It also is about her coming to terms with who she is, but it is just so mushy. There are no clear cut lines of where this film is trying to go. Naturally Streep dies and all is basically ironed out, but the film is just so... unmoving.

Stephen Stucker as Johnny Hinshaw, doing his Barbara Stanwyck impersonation and warning Nick and Heath that there is a fire in the barn? Barbara Billingsley as the nice lady translating what the stewardess says into jive? Personally, believe it or not, Robert Stack is the one who totally cracks me up, playing off his macho persona. While the greatest share of credit for ""Airplane!"" goes to the writing/directing triumvirate of Jim Abrahams, David Zucker and Jerry Zucker (does the order really matter with these guys?), the fact that they got such fam!iliar faces as Nielsen, Bridges, Billingsley and the rest to take these parts is what really makes this one work. All I know is that after ""Airplane!"" you fail to stick around and read the credits at the movies at your own risk.",Airplane VHS

I wasn't nuts about the sets as I've seen better but the performance of the orchestra, conductor and cast is terrific. Of course, Renee Fleming, Finley and Hagley were just perfect, as always.  The sound, color and camera work was excellent and I certainly can recommend this video as a valuable addition to anyone's collection.  I have many others but this ranks near the top as I certainly enjoyed the quality overall.  I gave it 4 stars for the sets which are typical of the venue and I thought just OK.  5 stars for the cast and enjoyment!

Personally I just loved watching Harrison Ford switching from bespectacled Professor Jones to the whip wielding Indiana. I had no trouble at all understanding why his class was almost all female, (I wish my college professors had looked like that!).

287813,"Cukor matches Joan Crawford's moral, social and, er, facial transformation with his own generic transformation.  The film, despite its underworld milieu and courtroom framework, begins as ripe melodrama; it closes as a finger-disfiguringly tense thriller.  Crawford plays one of the most remarkable female characters in Hollywood's history - how many female ganglords, blackmailers, thieves and women of easy virtue get not only to morally redeem themselves, but get the man too?  Behind it all, Cukor shapes a fierce, ironic social critique, and pulls off some of his most remarkable shots, my favourite being the hall of mirrors Joan admires herself in after the operation.",Woman's Face VHS

The worst problem is the Chinese subtitles that can't be removed.

246925,"Babette's Feast demonstrates one advantage the motion picture has over all other art forms.  As the feast that gives the film its name progresses, we watch the reaction of each of the guests at the table to each new culinary delight served by the chef, Babette.  These rough and common folk have been taught that heaven should be the focus of their lives, not the pleasures of this world, and they learn at this feast the lesson of Saint Francis that God's gifts are meant to be enjoyed in the here and now.  At first the guests doubt themselves.  Can food really be this good?  As each dish is served we watch with utter delight ourselves as they realize that a bit of heaven has been served up to them free of charge in this world.  Additionally, something more profound occurs. The love Babette puts in to her gift of this banquet to repay the two sisters who take her in to their home when she was in need of help repairs old wounds and annimosities and the people at the table learn that forgiveness, like good food, is something to be practiced and shared in this world.Babette's Feast is a film to be viewed more tnan once.  I loved it the first time I saw it and had a deeper appreciation of it the second time around.  For those viewers who want to watch an  excellent variation of this Western European classic, I also recommend highly Ang Lee's superb film, Eat Drink Man Woman.",Babette's Feast VHS
661330,"Movie Summary:  Darren is a big dork but he's got two good dorky friends named Wayne and JD. At a bar, Darren manages to meet a beautiful girl named Judith. They hook up and it soon becomes apparent that she is a psycho and treats Darren horribly. Wayne and JD can't stand seeing Darren so miserable, so they take it upon themselves to save him. They do anything and everything they can to break up Darren and Judith.My Opinion:  The trailer looked so promising and Jack Black was so great in High Fidelity that I really had high hopes for Saving Silverman. They were completely dashed by the stupidity of the movie. The basic premise is fine, two geeks saving a third from a psycho ..., but all the ""funny"" scenes and situations that they came up with for SS are just weak and stupid. All the best parts were shown in the trailer as is the current trend with movies lately. This could have been a good comedy on par with Something About Mary and Meet the Parents, one that appealed to both people who like stupid movies and people with brains. But they kept it stupid and those with brains are the ones who will have to suffer unless of course they heed the warning: To Heck With Silverman, Save Yourself!!DVD Quality: Widescreen anamorphic 1.85:1, DD5.1 Extras include commentary, production notes and two hidden video clips. Both picture and sound quality are great.What You Should Do:  Run for the hills and watch a tree for 95 minutes.

496072,"Harris' work is deeply intriguing in the way a body totally infested with carcinoma FASCInates (no pun, this!) and fixates the human attention. What if Uncle Adolf won WWII? Harris obviously did his research, and offers the transfixed reader a rare vision of the Hitlerian society had Nazi Germany existed till 1964. But b-a-a-a-a-d plotting flawed this novel-based HBO TV-movie. No character acted with conviction in the story. Much better if Harris had expanded this rather thin novel into a Dune-size novel with proper character-development. Harris could not explain plausibly the motives of Nebe, the Head of the nazi police, in aiding Sturmbannfuhrer Marsh, the leading SS black-clad flatfoot in this futuro-nazi-whodunnit. Perhaps he could have stirred in a plot by top nazis to exploit the scandal of the Holocaust to stage a supremely cynical putsch against Hitler and install a more &quot;acceptable&quot; liberal/progressive band of leaders acceptable to the civilized world. Lotsa lost opportunity here. Pity. Read it once to discover the promise that was not. The only visually interesting bit was the CGI recreation of what Berlin might have looked like if Albert Speer's (Hitler's pet architect) freudian designs had managed to get built.  Wait for the inevitable DVD to come out.  All in all, one of the better (and all too rare) Alternate Future works that made it to moviedom (albeit TV moviedom).

68066,"There's an underlying sadness that permeates this story of a marriage in trouble after fifteen years and two children that is so readily and immediately discernible that initially it becomes difficult to proceed.  And you quickly realize that it's because ""The Story of Us,"" directed by Rob Reiner, is indeed a story about loss, which is something that affects everyone in some way or another, at one time or another, and depending upon your personal frame of reference and experience, it's a story that is going to affect you on any number of levels.  Because loss comes in many forms; sometimes it leaves nothing more than a blip on the surface of your Moon, while at other times it leaves a gaping crater on the landscape of your World, and whichever it is in your case, this film is going to address it and perhaps make you revisit a time or place that maybe you've locked away in the dim recesses of your memory for better or worse.  One thing is certain, this film is going to make you take pause and reflect for a moment or two.  Because ""Us,"" anyway you slice it, is a film about you and me.Reflection is the key word here, for Reiner has crafted a film that is steeped in it; it's the way the characters involved play through the drama of their immediate lives and attempt to get on with it.  And it becomes an almost voyeuristic journey as you watch two people attempting to discover just what went wrong with their love, and not only when, but why.  Katie Jordan (Michelle Pfeiffer) and Ben Jordan (Bruce Willis) had it all at one time, but something happened; something in the fifteen years between the merging of two lives into one, during which they brought two children into the world and knew true happiness, and the realization that things had changed suddenly.  Or, perhaps, not so suddenly; and it's almost uncomfortable to be a part of it, observing from the sidelines and understanding what the principals involved simply can't seem to comprehend.It's the little things that are doing them in, and they just don't see it.  The main element being the inability to see themselves through the eyes of the other.  And it's not that they're self-centered by any means, it just a matter of instinctively wanting to maintain the autonomy that makes them unique, which in the beginning was what attracted them to one another.  It's a conundrum, and it's universal.  It's a matter of two people needing to reach that point-- which according to the individuals involved is going to vary greatly-- at which they can step outside of themselves and truly align their spirit with that of their significant other.  Some may call it unconditional love, but in reality it's something that goes beyond even that.  It's like discovering the meaning of life, or the true meaning of love.  And for some, it's something that unfortunately may forever fall just beyond their ability to grasp.A dramatic film with comedic overtones-- inasmuch as life itself is often funny, even at the most inopportune times-- Reiner takes something of a ""When Harry Met Sally"" approach with it, which initially doesn't seem to work; after all, this is decidedly not a romantic comedy.  But as the story unfolds you begin to realize that Reiner knows exactly what he's doing, because in retrospect, this is the way it goes in real life.  Things may be disintegrating internally, but life goes on; where the good times and laughter prevailed before, it remains, undaunted by the strife it fails to recognize in it's midst.  So, in the end, you have to give Reiner credit for having his finger on the pulse of reality, which at the beginning of the film comes across as somewhat pretentious, but by the end makes perfect sense and works beautifully in the telling of this story.Michelle Pfeiffer turns in a heartfelt performance as Katie, proving once again what a gifted actor she truly is.  Watching Katie, you know exactly what she is feeling and why, and Pfeiffer allows you to become emotionally involved to the point that you want to intervene and tell her you know what the problem is and how she can fix it.  Her Katie is a good person, a loving wife and mother, and you desperately want things to work out for her.  And it's frustrating to have to sit on the sidelines and be unable to help.  Which says something about the caliber of her performance.  It's that reality she brings to the character that draws you in so intimately, and it's one of the strengths of the film.Another strong point is the performance of Bruce Willis, who as Ben continues to shed that tough guy, ""Die Hard"" persona and emerge as an extremely capable actor with a range that is expanding with every movie he makes, which he's demonstrated in such films as ""Unbreakable"" and ""The Sixth Sense.""  Suffice to say that he's come a long way since his ""Moonlighting"" days.The supporting cast includes Colleen Rennison (Erin), Jake Sandvig (Josh), Rita Wilson (Rachel), Rob Reiner (Stan), Julie Hagerty (Lisa), Tim Matheson (Marty), Red Buttons (Arnie), Jayne Meadows (Dot), Betty White (Lillian) and Tom Poston (Harry).  Ultimately a satisfying experience, ""The Story of Us"" will touch some nerves and may reawaken some disconcerting feelings in many who see it, but like life, it's an emotional journey worth taking.  It's a ""Stop and smell the roses"" kind of film, but without any maudlin sentimentality or melodramatics.  Well acted and presented, it's a film that is definitely worth a look.",N/A
493689,"One scene in particular exemplifies why I like these movies.  In ""The Four Musketeers,"" troops are bombarding La Rochelle with cannon fire.  We see a long line of cannons, each going off in sequence.  In the foreground, we have a priest quietly blessing the cannons (in Latin, I think), and then between the cannons and the fortress, a herd of goats runs frantically along the line of the troops.There's always at least three things going on in any given scene, and many times unusual things.  Many times, these elements represent (seemingly) contradicting ideas (war/peace/animal herding), and so there's a touch of surrealism to many of the scenes -- it takes a moment to sort out how you feel about what you are seeing.  This lends itself to multiple viewings.Another note:  this regards this advertised twin pack of The Three Musketeers/The Four Musketeers.  I discovered that the credits in The Four Musketeers are in another language ... French, I believe.  It also seems to me that perhaps the soundtrack is not quite synchronized with the rest of the film in some places (but that may be just my imagination)...But soundtrack anomalies don't bother to me with this film, as the visuals are the important thing with these films, and that is not spoiled at all.  This was an odd thing, though, and I'd previously wondered why they were selling this twin pack at such a reduced cost ... there's your answer.Both films are still very enjoyable anyway, and I recommend not only getting the films but watching them many times, as you will see something new in them almost every time!",The Three Musketeers/The Four Musketeers VHS

Then the models, described as drug addicts or hiding shameful secrets.

The scenes of the murders are perfect, the director creating under our eyes an aesthetics that will be imitated by hundreds of directors in the seventies and the eighties.I could speak for hours of BLOOD AND BLACK LACE but then you would say that I'm not objective so if you still don't know Mario Bava, take a look at at this movie and become another fan of this italian Maestro who deserves to stay in Movie History.A DVD for your library.NB: I didn't have any problem with my Denon DVD-3000 during the screening.",N/A

His 1980 project, The Shining proved to be a big hit with the critics, and also proved that Stanley can do anything: comedy, drama, thriller, war, and in this case, terrifying and classical horror.An exceptional script from Stanley and his impressive co-writer are one of the key elements in this movie. It's engaging, it's intriguing and it has never been done before, making it a truly original film as well as a horrifying one. The actors are quite amazing, Jack Nicholson in particular in the most underrated performance of his career, and kiddo Danny Llyod manages to be believe every time, he follows Kubrick's instructions expertly as expertly as Scatman Crothers, an underrated actor with something about him that makes his characters so immensly watchable. The only actor who was pretty miscast was Shelley DuVall, who jumps on everything Nicholson says and comes off more as a child awaiting her suspension from school than a trapped, terrified soul. Other than that, Kubrick's direction and Nicholson's shouldering of the film make it one of the most engaging horror films of all time.The Shining is a must-see for all Kubrickian's, as well as most horror fans who look for more in films than just gore and jump-frights.The Shining: A",N/A

405972,"A brilliant adaption to this Broadway musical.Audrey Hepburn (&quot;Breakfast at Tiffiny's&quot;, &quot;The Nun's Story&quot;) is perfect for the role of Eliza Dolittle. From her accent as a flower seller, all the way to the beauty of the grand ball, she plays this role as if it's who she is. Rex Harrison (Doctor Dolittle) plays Professor Higgins, as he did in the Broadway musical. He has become the only person we could ever see in this role, as well as the first person who comes to mind when thinking about this film.The only criticism I have for this film is concerning the music. Hepburn, while I beautiful actress, is a TERRIBLE singer. Knowing this fact, the director casted someone to sing all of Hepburn's songs for her. The lip-sinking is pretty bad on some of the songs, the most noticable being on the song 'I Could Have Danced All Night' where Hepburn is not ever CLOSE to being in sink with the song. On the song 'Wouldn't It Be Lovely', the singer's voice comes out with a slightly different accent that Hepburn had. These are very slight flaws; you would only notice them if you were looking for them. All in all, this is a beautifully made movie, deserving all the awards that were given to the show.",N/A

576371,"Wrestling Gold Collection contains 5 volumes collecting vintage wrestling matches from the 1970s and 1980s.  Overall, there are 62 matches and about 11 hours of wrestling action.In addition, volumes I and II feature two biographies each.  Volume I features biographies for Shawn Michaels (a contemporary star) and Dave Meltzer, the noted wrestling journalist who co-hosts this series.  Volume II features biographies for Bruiser Brody, the late wrestling legend and Jim Cornette, the noted wrestling manager/promoter who also co-hosts this series.The biggest sell of this DVD series (which distinguishes it from the VHS version) is the optional ""Insider Commentary"" from series hosts Cornette and Meltzer which can be turned on in lieu of the original match audio.  The insider commentary offers great insights into wrestling history, the superstars that made the sport and the world of wrestling in general.Though called ""Wrestling Gold"" perhaps a better name for this series may have been ""The Best of Memphis and San Antonio Wrestling"" which is where most of the matches on these volumes were pulled from.  Here's a rundown of each volume:Volume I - Busted Open:  Eleven matches.Highlights:  a ""semi-historic"" bout between Adrian Adonis and Bob Orton Jr. for the Heavyweight Title with Lou Thesz as a guest announcer, Shawn Michaels as a rookie, several matches with Gino Hernandez and Tully Blanchard, Terry Funk, and one of Bruiser Brody and Abdullah the Butcher's legendary encounters.Volume II - The Maim Event:  Twelve matches.Highlights:  Several matches with Jerry ""The King"" Lawler, a few matches with Randy Savage, a rookie Rick Rude, The Von Erichs, the Road Warriors, the Rock N' Roll Express, Bruno Sammartino, The Sheik, Dick the Bruiser and The Crusher.  Plus, an AWESOME match with Nick Bockwinkel and Manny Fernandez.Volume III - We Like To Hurt People:  Fifteen matches.Highlights:  The historic NWA title match between Terry Funk and Harley Race, a few Jerry Lawler matches, Dory Funk Jr., The Sheik in a Cage match, Randy Savage, the R N' R Express, Ray Stevens and a Tennessee Street Fight.Volume IV - No More Mr. Nice Guy:  Twelve matches.Highlights:  The Wrestling Bear vs. Gene DuBois, The Shark Cage Match, Andre the Giant, 4 matches with Randy Savage, a few Lawler matches, 3 Rick Rude matches, a GREAT Nick Bockwinkel vs. Lawler match.Volume V - Beat Me If You Can:  Twelve matches.Highlights:  A Mud Match between The Sheik and Tiger Jeet Singh, Bobo Brazil, Magnum TA and some great tag action.Simply put, this DVD series is AWESOME and a must have for ANY wrestling fan.  Here's my rundown:Price of Admission:  Seeing some of the legends of the ring (like Andre the Giant, Bruno Sammartino, Dick the Bruiser, the Crusher, The Sheik, Nick Bockwinkel, the wrestling bear) and many of the contemporary older favorites (""Macho M an"" Randy Savage, Tully Blanchard, Tommy Rich, the Rock N' Roll Express, Manny Fernandez, Magnum TA, etc) in their primes and many of our departed stars like Rick Rude, Bruiser Brody, Eddie Gilbert, Gino Hernandez, etcPure Gold:  The ""Insider Match Commentary.""

Also, Cornette's anecdotes are PRICELESS.Could Improve:  The match intros.  Cornette and Meltzer do a good job introducing the matches and placing them in context of the feuds and time, BUT they neglect to mention important details like the DATES of these contests. It's something they should mention AND put on the box.  You'll have to listen with ""Insider Commentary"" to get this basic info, and even THEN may not get it!!!Give Me More!!!:  Only four biographies???  If they really wanted to immortalize the older legends of the sport it should have been all of THEIR biographies on the DVDs as opposed to a contemporary star like Shawn Michaels or Dave Meltzer and Jim Cornette (the two guys who promotes this DVD series), who come off as simply ""patting themselves on the back.""Overall, this series is a MUST HAVE if you are into old-school wrestling or just wrestling.  Several of the matches in this volume are great (Taylor/Sabu, the tag and six-man tag matches)!!! You'll see many of the older stars back in their prime or as rookies and some of the legends that older fans always reminisce about. If you are a wrestling nostalgist THIS IS FOR YOU.

As much as I liked the cheesy 70's and 80's Marvel movies(like Dr. Strange starring Peter Wooten in the title roll, thank you very much), Marvel movies to come will have to measure up to this one.

415703,"I saw this movie at the theater when it came out in the late summer of '96.  Maybe it was partly the company, but I found the movie enjoyable but not outstanding.  In other words, I was disappointed. Maybe I was jaded, having just recently turned 40.  Maybe it seemed silly to someone at that stage of life.Then last winter, I caught just a bit of it on VH1, and it made me want to see it again.  I saw it recently at my local grocery store for ($) and picked it up.  Finally I had the chance to sit down and watch it in its entirety once again, and I cannot convey what an enjoyable experience it was!  It totally recaptured what, for me, was great about growing up in the '60s...that feeling that anything could happen, that your radio could explode with another classic any second, that, if you were a musician, you could be on the radio yourself if you got a band together and wrote a good song.  Well, I was just a kid then, but I believed.This movie was obviously a labor of love for Tom Hanks - his attention to period detail is amazing.  He puts you right in the middle of the early summer of '64 in every way.  His soundtrack is just superb.  Rather than use actual songs from that time period, he creates, with help from other songwriters, his own pastiche of the sounds of '64, with splendid and amusing results.The movie bounced off of me the first time I saw it...and I'm not quite sure why.  All the performances are sterling, and there is really so much to appreciate...the song (That Thing You Do) getting better and better as they gain popularity, the acquisition of 'professional instruments' as they go on tour; most of all, the pure joy that is conveyed the first time they hear their song on the radio.  That moment, that magic moment, is conveyed with incredible excitement.  You feel like you are inside the characters as they react to the giddy shock of hearing their song on the airwaves.Like reality, the giddyness is bound to end and reality set in; hence the last third of the movie is a sober affair.  It was a letdown when I saw it the first time, but now it is a brilliant resolution and, really, very believable.  Here was a group with no foundation, no history, just a lucky happenstance.  It simply couldn't last.  The end was believable and, really, happy.The performances and direction are subtle.  The movie gets better with each subsequent viewing.

582632,"I'll go on record as saying this may be the finest film I've seen about the Cuban Missle Crisis, with the possible exception of actual film and news coverage from the time. If you're wondering WHY on earth you'd want to see a film about a historical even that has been analyzed, discussed and written about (some would say to death), the answer is this - this film offers a unique, gripping and special perspective on the Cuban Missle Crisis. Even if you lived through this period in our nation's history (as I did), I urge you to see this one. It is truly a classic study of leaders coping under the most intense, urgent pressure imaginable - and thinking admirably well on their feet.  We watched this one with our 17 year old son and the experience was definitely different for all three of us. My husband and I remembered how frightened our parents had been during the Curban Missle Crisis and even remembered such details as the drawn, anxious face of newsman Walter Cronkite (shown in this film) as he kept the country up to date on the ongoing drama. Our son, on the other hand, had a whole different perspective but was equally fascinated and riveted by this film. He glimpsed what it was like for our country to be on the brink of nuclear war - and from his reaction, I think it was a sobering, enlightening experience for him.  Be forewarned, there are some controversial sections in this film. The main focus and perspective of the film is that of presidential aide Kenneth O' Donnell (played by Kevin Costner) and there is also an emphasis on the Kennedys saving the world from the military's ambitious war plans. yet there is also a serious commitment to historical detail and accuracy in most areas of the film that make up for any flaws. While any version of this film is worth seeing, you'll get special pleasure from the DVD version, with the behind the scenes information about the history and mood of our culture during this period. I plan to watch this film several times. It is simply THAT good.",N/A
504452,"The first body count-movie, Bava's &quot;B&amp;BL&quot; truly ushered in a whole genre of horror film.  Many directors were admittedly influenced by Bava's work including Carpenter, Argento and even Almodovar.  Bava created a whole style on his own that no one will ever be able to completely re-create, but it's worth trying.  BLACK LACE introduced audiences to the giallo, an italian horror-mystery --- the masked and gloved killer, the various suspects, the damsels that will surely die, the violent killings, the murderer's identity revealed --- and it also introduced the &quot;body count&quot; gimmick  (check out the euro-trailers for the film on the disc as they count down the victims one by one --- &quot;Friday the 13th&quot; would rip-off this advertising campaign 15 years later!)  You can't watch BLACK LACE without laughing somewhat at some of the character's actions and lines, and dubbed voices, but the script is not the key here.  It's the style, lighting, colors, camera movements...and of course, the deliriously fun murder scenes that make this a masterpiece of horror.  The movie looks stunning, colors are vibrant --- and it's uncut featuring the one blood-moving-in-water shot from the bathtub scene which has always been edited.  The DVD includes a fun Cameron Mitchell interview, an interview with actress Mary Arden who played the model Peggy in the film, some other Bava trailers (&quot;Erik the Conqueror&quot;), the original American re-shot title sequence (quite good), a Tim Lucas commentary track, photo gallery and more.  It's a great disc - recommended highly.",N/A
420131,"Untamed Heart stars Christian Slater, Marisa Tomei, and Rosie Perez.  All three work in a diner where Slater is a busboy, while Tomei and Perez play waitresses.  Tomei plays Caroline, and is kind of a ditzy girl, but very sweet.  Seems she has a problem with the boys she goes out with, in that they don't treat her particularly well, cheating on her and such.  Perez plays Cindy, the more streetwise friend who tries to help Caroline out when she can, setting her up on dates, and commiserating with her when things go poorly.  Slater plays Adam, a quiet and shy person who has a crush on Caroline.  Cindy thinks Adam is mentally disabled, since he very rarely says two words, but Caroline sees him a little different, with more of an understanding attitude, but not as a romantic interest, at least at the beginning of the movie.As the movie progresses, we see Adam saving Caroline from a particularly nasty situation when she is attacked by two men on her way home from work one night.  When she finds out it was Adam that saved her and cared for her, she begins to look beneath the surface at Adam, and finds more than she expected.  She learns of his feelings for her, and they develop a relationship, and fall in love.  Actually, Adam has always been in love with Caroline, so it's just Caroline who comes around feeling for Adam what he feels for her.  In getting to know Adam, Caroline learns that Adam was an orphan with a weak heart, and the nuns in the orphanage gave him some story about him having a baboon heart, which he still believed to this day.  Their relationship is very sweet, as we see Adam's unrequited love fulfill, and Caroline finds someone who treats her the way she should be treated, the way anybody should be treated, with love, caring, thoughtfulness, and respect.  Well, things are going really well, until the two guys that attacked Caroline and were subsequently beat up by Adam show up again and are looking for revenge on Adam.  I don't want to go any further, as that would spoil things for someone who hasn't seen this yet, but I really liked how this movie ended.I guess one of the reasons I like this movie so much is I could kind of identify with Slater's character, being awkward and shy myself in school.  I know how it was to have a deep crush on someone, and yet not be able to bring yourself to tell that person how you feel.  Sometimes it can be difficult to keep that kind of thing inside, but then if you let it out, there is a good chance that you may spoil the fantasy with the harsh reality.  There were one or two points in the movie when I did tear up a little, and that doesn't happen often for me while watching movies (Old Yeller, Pride of the Yankees, Goodbye Mr. Chips).  Slater plays his character well, and Tomei is incredibly cute and seems to pull off the sort of ditzy, but sweet and caring girl quite well.  Perez also does a good job in her role.  A sweet and sappy movie, for sure, but very watchable.  Not much with regards to special features, but you do get an excellent wide screen presentation.",N/A
153680,"ESCAPE FROM NEW YORK is a movie that proves that action doesn't have to be excessive and messy to be fun and that if it's kept simple enough it can still be good quality entertainment.  The makers tried to practically remake this movie years later as ESCAPE FROM L.A. throwing in everything they could think of and it was a flop.  I asked my friend what he thought of L.A. and he said it was great, I showed him NEW YORK and he loved it.  Almost same story, and much simplar.  Anyway on with the review.Future society's crime rate has risen skyhigh (400%)  To help combat this, Manhattan island is transformed into a super lock up prison surrounded by walls, armed guards and mines.  The worst criminals get sent here to live till they die, no pardons.Former war hero Snake Plisskin (Russell plays such an unpleasant character, he could almost be one of the villians,) is on his way to New York for getting caught robbing the Federal Reserve, when he is offered a deal.  He must rescue the President who'se plane has crashed into New York by terrorists.  It is important that the President be rescued in 24 hours so that he can attend a peace summit that could prevent nuclear war.  To ensure Snake's loyalty, small explosives have been implanted inside of him that will go off in 24 hours.  If he succeeds, he'll get a pardon.  It's do or die, but Snake accepts. &quot;Either way, I go in.&quot;Maneuvering through the decayed urban mess of New york, Snake must battle scavengers, &quot;crazies&quot; and other unpleantness on his mission to rescue the President.  Snake even gets help form some old friends, all of whom tell him, &quot;I thought you were dead!&quot;Chock full of some terrific paseing, great characters, and decent action scenes, ESCAPE FROM NEW YORK is a cool movie that today's action movies can learn a lesson from.  Cool box art too.",N/A
383316,"Okay, I'll admit it.  The box cover tempted me to rent it, particularly as the quoted reviews on the box were good.  But it was not what I expected.  The whole movie is about being not what you expected.  We think we understand the people we are seeing, we want to put them into stereotypes, but it doesn't work that way. The movie shows how one event (which we never fully understand until the VERY end) can have life-changing impacts on so many people.  We see all these strange plot elements coming together, almost (sorry for the cliche) like a rug being woven. Seeming unconnected elements come together into a whole.It is also a sad movie. Not like a tear-jerker sad, but a sadness that permeates all the characters throughout.  They have no joy...the stripping has ZERO joy, so do not get this movie if you want stripping. It is paced to match this sadness, and the performances are minimal and spare. If you need fast-paced, Hollywood style plot development, stay far away.  If you need something though-provoking, surprising and emotionally draining, here you go!  (Be sure to see Egoyan's SWEET HEREAFTER too.)",Exotica VHS
181729,"Superb (m/r)ockumentary of the semi-fictitious band &quot;Spinal Tap&quot;, made up of Michael McKean (&quot;Lenny&quot;, soul mate of Squigy, on the TV series &quot;Laverne &amp; Shirley&quot;), Christopher Guest (actor/director of &quot;Waiting for Guffman&quot;), Harry Shearer (performs voices of 22 different characters on &quot;The Simpsons&quot;), and a random selection of ever-changing drummers.  The movie is a tongue-in-cheek parody of washed-up hard rock bands that still think they are God's gift to the universe.  The inspired idiocy borders on genius at times, lending weight to Michael's observation that there is a &quot;fine line between stupid and clever&quot;.The DVD is simply amazing.  For starters, everything is in character.  From the style of the main menu title screen, to the menu voice-overs by the band, and extending through all of the extra material included on the DVD, the personas of the band (and the fictitious director as well) are maintained with perfect consistency.What makes this all the more amazing is the shear quantity of extras on the disk.  For starters, there is about an hour of &quot;deleted&quot; scenes provided.  In addition, there are numerous music videos, TV commercials (fake I presume???), and trailers.  And as if that weren't enough, there is also a commentary track throughout the entire film with the band members, completely in character, being as hilariously idiotic as they are in the film.  The Spinal Tap commentary track is easily the most entertaining commentary in my extensive DVD library.The DVD medium is put to splendid use as well.  Menu transitions are computer animations inspired by some of the film's funniest moments.  Each menu plays a different &quot;Tap&quot; song, giving you access to a decent percentage of the sound track.  And, just as importantly, the animations are not overdone; the menus are still easy to use, and the transitions only take a few seconds.Overall, this DVD is a great value, and provides a vast amount of material not available in the VHS version.

123600,"Shane is probably the definitive western plot, it has a myth built into it like know other film I have ever seen. It was I believe born of a time and a place of honor and virtue that is little seen in films of today. Shane at first is a little on edge, spent a little too long in the wild country, then his strength of character is misinterpreted by the local ranchers as cowardice, trying as he is to change his ways, but Shane standing in the rain soon dispels this opinion. When he goes back into the bar where he was rousted. There is a great scene here when the cowpuncher Chris tries to bully Shane once more. The cowpuncher next to Chris says deal me out, Chris says what's the matter? and the puncher that you never see says, let's just say I'm superstitious. I've seen dam few bloody noses in all the fights I have seen on film but Shane procures the best. What I really love about this film is that you never find out who Shane really is or just what kind of a man he really is and the kind of metal that he is made of until the end of the film, then it's too late. Just enough time for the boy to say goodbye to Shane, Shane tells him to grow up strong and straight, and to take care of his folks and in his passing everyman says goodbye to the childhood within. The boy calls out in vain the moment is forever.  It's one Great film, to all those who love the sentiment of the western and have never seen Shane I envy you that viewing.",N/A
534937,"Robert Zemeckis is an extraordinarily compelling filmmaker, and he knows when to keep things seemingly simple.  Tom Hanks again proves his acting chops in this very imaginative psychological adventure tale; from the moment he is in the plane until he is rescued, this is one magnetically charged movie, and in ways you might not expect.  The plane crash itself jolts your senses; it is that kind of big-screen sequence in which you lose all sense of time and place and are in the movie; Cast Away remains that way throughout the entire sequence on the island.  The ocean waves themselves become characters, and their incessant pounding on the surf takes on a horrific quality, even in its natural beauty. But as sure-footed as this movie is when Tom is &quot;cast away&quot;, it is disheartening to report that the final half hour or so, featuring an uninteresting Helen Hunt, robs us of the very buildup we've been mesmerized by for over 90 minutes.  And the bookend plot device simply does not give us what we want after having endured so much.  Still, you will not likely see a more creatively charged big-budget movie this season, nor a performance as riveting at Hanks'.  The device of Wilson the volleyball as Hanks' only &quot;friend&quot; is brilliantly executed, with an emotional payoff as surprising as it is deftly handled.",N/A

Several reasons why this movie was bad other than the forementioned people/ideas: 1: Wouldn't it be easier to train astronauts to drill vs. drillers to be astronauts? 2: The OVER-dramatic scene where the ""drillers"" are walking to the space shuttle cutting back (flashy, MTV style, mind you) to Liv Tyler and Billy Bob Thorton looking toward the sky each in a different pose behind an American flag ALL while an Aerosmith song is playing in the background...

If you want a realistic movie about cometary evolution (which armageddon is supposed to be about) see: Deep Impact.

8304,"I'm getting just a teensy bit tired of movies described as great when the greatest thing about them was the cinematography. I gather that we think when we can break down the elements that went into a movie - cinematography, sound, lighting, special effects, direction - we sound like we're knowledgeable about `films'. I've done it, too. It's a way to weasel out of a dispute if anyone challenges my fondness or hatred for a movie. ""Ah yes, you're right, it wasn't that good/bad overall. But the cinematography was good/bad."" Since I'd noticed that the cinematography in Eraser, an incredibly boring movie, was good, I figure all I am is pompous.Anyway, the cinematography in Seven Years in Tibet is great, as are most of the individual elements. It's just that there's something a little flat about the story, which keeps the movie from being great. It's based on the real life story of  Heinrich Harrer, who, from what I understand from other sources, had an interesting life, but wasn't an especially interesting character, nor an open or out-going one. With these restrictions, Brad Pitt does a good job with the portrayal. The look back at the Tibetan culture in the 1940's was interesting. Overall, the movie is better than Dances with Wolves (speaking of pompous), and not as good as Lawrence of Arabia (but then, what is?), and the quality of the DVD is good.

325475,"&quot;Jesus of Nazareth&quot; is arguably the best film version on the life of Christ ever made. A quick scan through these reviews, as well as a search on the Internet, will verify this. It has been hailed by Christians of all traditions: Catholic, Orthodox and Protestant alike.I'd like to recommend this as a Lenten experience for interested families. While our family has seen &quot;Jesus of Nazareth&quot; many times, this year is the first time we opted to make it part of Great Lent, spreading all 6.5 hours over three weeks. Families with younger children may want to view it in shorter segments, such as an hour at a time.This year I found the images of this film mingling with my private prayers, as well as during moments of the Divine Liturgy in our church. Zeffirelli uses a master's brush to &quot;paint&quot; images that evoke familiar Biblical paintings, frescoes, statues and icons. Having those images run through my mind enabled me to identify with characters in the gospel narrative, such as when praying:&quot;Receive me, O Christ Who lovest the world, as Thou didst receive the prostitute, the thief, the tax collector and the prodigal.&quot;One error in the film was brought to my attention while discussing it with friends. Mary Magdalene is portrayed as the harlot at the feet of Jesus, which is not supported by a careful reading of the Scriptures. Apparently this perception came into common thinking several hundred years after she lived. Some may see this as a minor problem, but it colors our view of this true and devoted disciple who is called &quot;Equal to the Apostles.&quot;One of the complaints I've noticed from other reviewers is that the Jesus in this film is distant, lacking in compassion. While I might have agreed with this in earlier years, I now feel that He can be viewed as a model for how we are called to be dispassionate, not ruled by our passions and emotions. Here, Jesus never failed to respond to those in need, however He was not driven by mere emotion. But this Jesus is not emotionless. For example, we see His anger at the &quot;den of thieves,&quot; and His tears of anguish in the garden. In other words, He was in control of His emotions, as He wants us to be.If you have never seen Zeffirelli's &quot;Jesus of Nazareth,&quot; I highly recommend it. It's well worth the investment of time...at Lent or at any other time of the year.",N/A
123721,"Shane might well be the greatest western ever made and a true American classic.  Recently in a New York Times article, Woody Allen of all people considered it the best American film of all time.  The movie is about a mysterious stranger who unexpectently comes into a homestead family's life and helps in their battle against a greedy landowner who is threatening them to move off their land.  Alan Ladd stars in the title role and he exudes an air of calm control and dark mystery.  Shane is an expert gunman and a skilled fighter, but he doesn't want any trouble.  He tries hard to avoid a fight in the local saloon, but no matter how hard he tries, trouble finds him.  The homestead family is played by Van Heflin, Jean Arthur and the young Brandon De Wilde.  Mr. De Wilde is excellent as a wild-eyed youngster who grows to idolize Shane.  Mr. Heflin plays the strong, defiant landowner, but also loving husband to his devoted wife, played tenderly by Ms. Arthur, and his son.  He stands by his new friend Shane, when the other homesteaders want him to leave when they feel he's stirring up trouble.  A young Jack Palance is menacing as an icy hired gun hired to drive the homesteaders off their land.  The showdown between him and Shane is a tense and taut showdown.  Director George Stevens captures the breathtaking beauty of the American Old West.  Shane was nominated for several Academy Awards, but failed to win any.

The bad guys wear lightning bolts on their heads, which actually look pretty good for soldiers in an atom-powered army.The Volkites are the coolest thing about the serial. They are the original walking trash can robots, similar to the ones that appear in the Captain Proton segments of Star Trek Voyager.The real question is why Unga Khan has all of the technology, while the Sacred City has none.

459546,"Peter Sellers returns as Chief Inspector Clouseau in this fifth and final installment of the ""Pink Panther"" series, in ""Revenge Of The Pink Panther,"" directed by Blake Edwards.  This time around, Clouseau becomes the target of a drug lord, Douvier (Robert Webber), who finds it necessary to prove to colleagues that he is still ""strong.""  When the assassination attempt is summarily pronounced successful, it affords Clouseau the edge of pursuing the criminals through the use of disguise and the deft application of stealth as only Clouseau could effect.  Meanwhile, former Chief Inspector Dreyfus (Herbert Lom) is pronounced fit, and returned to his position at the department.  And, as would be expected, it all adds up to a bad time for the criminals, as well as the hapless Dreyfus.  Edwards does a good job with this film, though it's not on a par with the previous outing, ""The Pink Panther Strikes Again,"" which was arguably the best (and funniest) of the series.  There are scenes involving behind-closed-door meetings of the criminal element that seem to bog things down a bit, but with Sellers on hand they seem almost insignificant, for as soon as Clouseau arrives on the scene they're up and running once again.  And Sellers has some classic moments in this one:  Trying on new disguises at the establishment of Dr. Auguste Balls (Graham Stark), a veritable haberdashery for undercover surveillance; posing as a rotund ""Godfather"" and insinuating himself into the mob; and a foray as a peg-legged pirate with an inflatable parrot on his shoulder.  The story line in this one may be considered thin-- Edwards gives it just enough to serve as a setting in which to showcase the talents of his star-- but there's nothing wrong with that; it's funny stuff, and watching Sellers work is worth the price of a ticket alone.  One of the most memorable moments in the film, however, is courtesy of Herbert Lom, as Dreyfus gives the eulogy for the ""late"" Chief Inspector Clouseau and can barely contain his mirth, with his tears of joy construed, of course, as grief.  And for the first time in the series, Clouseau's faithful manservant, Cato (Burt Kwouk) accompanies the Inspector during his investigation, which adds to the merriment, but is not necessarily a boon to getting the case, as Clouseau would say, ""solv-ed.""  The supporting cast includes Dyan Cannon (Simone Legree), Robert Loggia (Marchione), Tony Beckley (Algo), Andre Maranne (Francois), Charles Augins (Vic) and Douglas Wilmer (Police Commissioner).  With &quot;Revenge Of The Pink Panther,"" Edwards delivers an above average comedy that is good for a lot of laughs, and he finishes it off with an extended, slapstick finale that really gives some sock to the overall movie.  What will stay with you forever, however, is the image of Clouseau, and recalling his antics will provide you with some chuckles for a long time afterwards.  In the end, this film stands as a tribute to the great Peter Sellers, as proof positive that NOBODY does it better.",N/A

I'm writing this review after viewing the video yet again in the hopes that someone else will watch this treasure and spread the word so that it will get the recognition and audience it deserves.The story of the love between Robert E. Howard and Novalyne Price is brought to life effectively by actors Vincent D'Onofrio and Renee Zellweger. They show an incredible understanding of their characters and depth of feeling in their portrayals. You can't help being frustrated by their attempts to connect, and yet you know that their true hearts somehow do.What this film also shows like no other I've seen is the reality of loving an artist--one who is consumed by his work, his art, his passion. And how you can be dear to that person but still outside of his world. Added to this, of course, is an obsessive mother-son relationship that somehow comes across as sympathetic.So Novalyne had her work cut out for her, but she also had incredible strength and will forces of her own. Although she doesn't deeply question the conventions of society, she recognizes her debt to them. She achieves much in her own life and refuses to get cynical. And Renee Zellweger embodies her and makes us feel her deep esteem and appreciation for Robert E. Howard.Vincent D'Onofrio is a wonder. You've got to see this movie to appreciate the way he brings the pulp writer to larger than life. D'Onofrio has done many great roles, but I think at this point his portrayal of Robert E. Howard is a career-best.It's a romance, an adventure, a history, and an intrigue all in one, featuring one of the most passionate screen kisses ever, a great score, beautiful vistas, and wondrous performances.",N/A

I was lucky enough to have seen Star Wars &quot;A New Hope&quot; opening day in May 1977 in the movie theaters before it was &quot;The New Hope&quot;. And since then it's opened up the way I've looked at movies, art and storytelling. Since then I've followed the Star Wars saga. Then &quot; The Phantom Menace&quot; came out last year to a lot of HYPE!! The giddiness and fervor brought everyone's expectations beyond reasonable acceptance of TPM. And unfortunately TPM was even worst than reasonable expectations of a good movie. As part of the &quot;old school&quot; Star Wars legion I was annoyed. Lucas' shallow attempt at gimmickry with Jar-Jar Binks, the stinted and staccato dialogue, and inundation of &quot;background&quot; storylines over a smooth linnear plotline threw what respect I had for the TPM in the trash bin with my discarded popcorn box.I'm still a great Star Wars fan. But George Lucas has got to get back to roots; to what made &quot;American Graffiti&quot; and &quot;Star Wars&quot; great movies to watch. There was texture, great dialogue, and a sense of that &quot;documentary&quot; reality that was evident in both movies just mentioned. He's got to get back to storylines and character empathy over slick marketing computer graphics easily transferred to toys and marketing items. He's got to care about telling a story rather than selling a story. So beware the HYPE. I'm going to watch ATC. And I will suspend my cynicism to enjoy the movie. But please, beware the dark side of the hype...",N/A
479089,"Released in 1974, Ilsa Shewolf of the SS is one of the very first true gore films, and still one of the most infamous. Much like Bloodsucking Freaks and I Spit On Your Grave, this movie is probably more controversial today then it was when it was released.One thing is for sure though, unlike those films, this movie is still truly shocking, thanks to better than usual effects and an even greater lack of good taste. To say Ilsa is in bad taste is a great understatement. If you're not offended by this one, you probably won't be offended by anything.Probably the nastiest bit is the woman who is boiled alive in hot water.If you have a strong stomach, and you love these over-the-top gore/exploitation films, then give this first in the Ilsa series a rent! ...",Ilsa - She Wolf of the SS VHS

506916,"This film blew me away! I always know what I am looking forward to in an Orson Welles film; brilliant camera angles over lapping dialogue and that masterfull voice but I was floored by how well all of those aspects are used in Othello. It's hard to believe it was four years in the making and that the production of this film was marred by unusual circumstances but welles never gave up and the beauty is on screen to marvel at. Welles was a master of Shakespeare since a child so the dialogue flows as if second nature to him and the rest of the seasoned veterans handle it just as well and that is the key to this film. Welles always had pure facial emotion working in his favor and when those huge glowing eyes of his is used in the final scenes as he kills Desdamona its as if headlights of danger are piercing through his face and the dark almost unbearable lighting can't hold back those eyes or the viewers emotions and the soundtrack that damn haunting score never looses it's pacing simply amazing. Finaly Welles' fluxuating girth comes in handy his Othello is so imposing and commanding that u to would fear the repercussions of his hand if you betray him! Just cut out all the lights unplug the phone and watch with amazment at the best adaption of Othello ever made! McLiammour plays Iago with such contempt and an under lying lust for the moor that another level of depth is revealed. The opening is all out dramatic and ever the more shoking and draws you into the story instantly! Welles' reworking of the dialogue and dramatic use of the camera and lighting makes the flick ever so frightening and perverse! Doves flying above in a clear sky, the shores crashing against the waves as Othello is told by Iago of his wife's deceit or the gripping of the knife being shoved into Welles' by himself to redeem himself for the crime he has committed against his love! Shakespeare has never been told with the passsion upon which Welles tells it!",N/A
94088,"Batman takes a back seat to Burton's deranged ideas- killer clowns, seductive cat women, mutants, an army of penguins, and other nonsense.  It's simply too much.  The plot is confusing and extremely convoluted, and by the time it's half way through, you just don't care.  Wheras the excellent first film had Batman fighting an actual human (though terribly scared), this time Batman spends most of his time killing rampaging circus freaks.  The dark, serious, surrealistic, apocalyptic feel of the first film is totally lost here.  It's been thrown out the window in favor of pure craziness, Burton-style.  Plus, Elfman's score is too light and very dissapointing.  But, the few action scenes it has are great, and it does have some standout performances.  And it's certainly better than the Kilmer/Clooney crap movies.",N/A

15494,"Some outstanding performances (including one Oscar winner) highlight this story of a young woman who loses a year of her life incarcerated in a mental hospital, mainly due to society's penchant at the time for institutionalizing even the borderline mentally infirm.  ""Girl, Interrupted,"" directed by James Mangold, is the story (based on her autobiography) of Susanna Kaysen (Winona Ryder), a young aspiring writer suffering from depression.  After what may or may not have been a suicide attempt (she chases a bottle of aspirin with a bottle of vodka), she is spirited off to a private mental hospital, where she is diagnosed as having a ""borderline personality defect.""  Simply put, it means she is young, intelligent and having trouble coping with an era (the `60s) and a world in a state of flux, as well as the pressure from her parents and peers to attend an upscale university.  Susanna, however, wants only to live life and write, and though she knows her own mind in this regard, the forces that surround her are too great, and she is torn between what she wants, and what the ""world"" expects.  All of which leads her into some gray areas in which time and space as she knows it suddenly does not necessarily coincide with the continuum of reality.A powerful film that makes a statement about tolerance and the methods of treatment available for the mentally ill, it underscores the necessity for compassion and understanding of those unable to function on their own.  And it successfully illustrates that in dealing with people in need, there must be a humanistic approach, as  it is more involved than merely separating the wheat from the chaff.As Susanna, Winona Ryder gives a performance that is both affecting and intense; she readily conveys the angst of a young woman confused, yet determined, who has yet to learn one of life's most valuable lessons:  Make the decision.  Susanna has been walking a fence that gets narrower with each step she takes, until finally, her fall to either one side or the other was inevitable.  What she had yet to learn at that point, was that it is better to stop before you reach the end of the fence, so as to be able to decide for yourself which way you're going to fall.  That way, for better or worse, at least you know that ""you've"" made the decision that's going to affect your life, which makes it easier to live with.  Susanna could have saved herself a lot of misery had she stated unequivocally to her parents, and most importantly to herself, that after High School graduation ""this"" is what I am going to do.  A hard concept to grasp, however, when one is eighteen and being pulled in opposite directions at the same time.In her Oscar winning performance, Angelina Jolie proves beyond the shadow of a doubt that, indeed, there is substance beneath the beauty.  As Lisa, the sociopath with an ice cube for a heart, she brings an enigmatic, intimidating presence to the screen.  A soulless miscreant, she thrives within the confines of the institution by bullying her way through every day of her life.  On the ""outside,"" however, she finds repeatedly that the bravura that works for her in confinement attracts only the kind of attention that gets her sent back again.  It's a dynamic, over-the-top, in-your-face performance for which she deservedly received the award for Best Supporting Actress.  And, hopefully, after proving here what she is truly capable of, Jolie's career will successfully transcend her looks and that already famous pair of lips (though following this effort with the stagnating ""Gone In 60 Seconds"" does not bode well).The supporting cast includes Clea DuVall (Georgina), Brittany Murphy (Daisy), Elisabeth Moss (Polly), Jared Leto (Tobias), Jeffrey Tambor (Dr. Potts), Vanessa Redgrave (Dr. Wick), Whoopi Goldberg (Valerie), Mary Kay Place (Mrs. Gilcrest), Kurtwood Smith (Dr. Crumble) and Angela Bettis (Janet).  A somewhat disturbing film, ""Girl, Interrupted"" will affect you on any number of emotional levels and will command, not only your attention, but your involvement.  Simply put, this is riveting drama that refuses to let you off the hook for even a moment.  There's a message in here about the perspectives and significance of society as a whole, but more importantly, about the impact an individual can make on our world and the people around us, and of the importance of forging ahead and making a decision before it's too late.",N/A

668536,"I'm a Norwegian myself, so naturally I had looked forward to Harald Zwart's Hollywood debut, ONE NIGHT AT MCCOOL's, with high hopes and much anticipation. I'd seen some of Zwart's earlier works, like HAMILTON and the controversial music video for A-HA, and the fella did seem to be talented (albeit somewhat commercial). In addition to this, ONE NIGHT AT MCCOOL's fronted a strong cast (although I'm not Mat Dillon's number one fan) and a storyline that claimed to lend influence from Coen films (and you gotta love them Coen brothers). So my question is; Where did it all go wrong? Well, the film is just too unoriginal. The jokes are old. It's no longer funny seeing a fat police officer stand behind a cuffed man so that it would appear they're doing ""you know what"". It's been done to death. This is certainly the film's main problem. Another thing that didn't quite ""click"" for me was the performance of Liv Tyler. I find the notion of a film where the main character is not the center of narration, as quite intruiging, but Liv Tyler's character remains pretty much the same even though we view her from the perspectives of three different men. It would have been nice to see some traces of changes in her character. The ending is also not a lot to scream about ... So with all these things hampering the film, it doesn't really matter that the film fronts strong visuals (which is often the case when the director has a background doing music videos) and a gallery of what could have been interesting characters. There's just too much keeping this flower from blossoming.",One Night at McCool's

But not so much because of any capricious flights of fancy, but rather because of the fascinating mix of one very bright inner-city youngster who wants desperately to belong, and one churlish and equally bright, but panicky, recluse who wants desperately to be left alone - or so they both thought.A marvelous tale that will probably make some English composition teachers cringe, and will reaffirm many students' suspicions that every school faculty has at least one pompous bigot begging to be dethroned.  But the story isn't some intellectual version of the never-ending marshal-arts genre.  Rather, &quot;Forrester&quot; is an enthralling story about two people separated by several generations and vastly different experiences, but symbiotically linked by their search to find out what they can accomplish with their uncommon talents, even if it requires each of them to stretch well beyond their comfort zones.&quot;Forrester&quot; is about growing up - as suffered at both the dawn and sunset of adulthood.

131326,"This was the best 1800 scenery and costumes I've ever seen in a movie. Combined with the clever use/lack of color, they conjured up an image of precisely what we would think 1800 New England would look and feel like.The worst thing about the movie was the music. It was quite dreadful and lacked any sort of synchronization with the ongoing plot. Mystery music continued through the comical scenes so much that it confuses the watcher and almost hides the comedy itself. It did very little to strengthen the plot and most of the scenes could have done without music entirely as the scenery, color, sound, plot, and acting were more than capable of sustaining the movie's quality.I really didn't know what to expect when going into this. Some critics bashed it for not sticking to the book and others praised the costumes and scenery. I don't see the veering from the book's plot a weakness at all. In fact, it was much more entertaining and satisfying than the original.I was a bit confused about Ichabod Crane's character and personality. Although Depp appeared to play what was directed, the character itself seemed to lack the intelligence, experience, and couth you'd expect from the character in the original story. But alas, this is a rewrite, so I probably should not criticize for this.Christina Ricci (Katrina) definitely shows promise although she appeared to lack enthusiasm. For that much money, you would expect her to be able to &quot;fake it&quot;, but it was still a decent job. Miranda Richardson (Lady Van Tassel) had some good moments, but she also lacked enthusiasm and seemed very distant at times. She has proven worthy with perfect performances in &quot;Merlin&quot; and &quot;Alice in Wonderland&quot;.Fabulous performances by all of the members on the town's council, but Jeffrey Jones is still stuck in my head as &quot;Charles Deitz&quot; in &quot;Beetlejuice&quot;.Christopher Walken was absolutely incredible and easily stole the show!!

410653,"Somewhere in the tenebrous recesses of our souls is the saving ability to laugh in recognition at our most forlorn circumstances. The funniest films mine this trove of despairing exigencies in an urgent, played-for-real mode. And none do it better than WITHNAIL & I, now available in a superb uncut version on DVD.Bruce Robinson, the sometime actor and screenwriter (""The Killing Fields""), made his 1986 directorial debut with his semi-autobiographical screenplay that is widely considered the greatest neglected comedy of all time. The slender plot is simple. Flatmates Richard E. Grant (Withnail) and Paul McGann (& I) are two stoned, hungry, broke, and out-of-work actors wallowing in self-made squalor. When they get an opportunity to spend a weekend in the country cottage of Withnail's three hundred pound Uncle Montague, they go, hoping to ""rejuvenate."" What ensues is an extraordinarily deranged weekend of drunken delusion and distraught discovery that you will never forget. To reveal any more story details would be a gross disservice to those who have not yet found this wonderfully twisted, honest and perfect film.Richard Griffiths is unsettling as the campy, dissolute predator cousin Montague and Ralph Brown is spot-on as Danny, the slow-talking, menacing but philosophical dope dealer. Hard to believe this was Richard E. Grant's first film. Even harder to believe is that he is a non-drinker who doesn't smoke.Perfectly cast, nearly every spoken line is unfiltered emotional truth and most are quotable -- especially the caustic diatribes of drunken, acerbic Grant. And the scenes themselves are brilliant set-pieces that unfold like diamonds in the rough being cut to gem-stone perfection.After experiencing this unblinking look back at the end of the 60s in a London suburb where a tenuous friendship, high expectations and unfulfilled dreams collide during a disastrous weekend getaway, you too will laugh when you next hear the opening riffs of Jimmy Hendrix's ""Voodoo Child."" And you will understand when someone blurts out in a restaurant, ""We want the finest wines available to humanity. We want them here and we want them NOW!. And cake.""This new Criterion widescreen version is clean and sharp and there's a too-short bonus interview with Robinson, Brown, Grant and McGann.You must trust me on this one, so right now, get on line and order this extraordinary movie. It's one to own and watch at least once a month. It will put everything in the proper perspective and cure what ails you.  Highest recommendation.",Withnail & I VHS

The film combines interview clips of Dick's friends with selections from tape recordings of PKD, shown with a cartoon figure of Phil miming the words.For those who have read the Lawrence Sutin biography (Divine Invasions) or any of the extensive biographical material that has been published since Dick's death, there isn't much that's new in this film.  However, Robert Anton Wilson (author of the Illuminati Trilogy), Ray Nelson (SF author, best known for the story on which ""They Live"" is based) and Paul Williams, former Rolling Stone writer and literary executor of Dick's estate, are especially fascinating to listen to, and the material is compelling even though it may be familiar.For those interested in more details of Dick's life, the Lawrence Sutin biography is by far the best resource, but this film is an excellent place to start.",The Gospel According to Philip K.

Lots of unpredictable relationships as well (It's not clear from the start if any of the goddesses will fall in love with any of the characters, and if so will that love be returned).Technically it's pretty good.

152494,"""Platoon"" definately stands out as one of the most beautiful and finest war movies ever made. While not exactly having a plot, Stone paints a vivid picture of the horrors of war. it's basicly about Chris (Charlie Sheen), a colledge dropout who decides to volunteer to go off and fight in Vietnam. He quickly learns that war is no game; it's a living hell. there are two sergeants fighting over command of Chris's platoon, and he is influenced by both. Willem Dafoe (in his best screen performance) portrays Sgt. Elias, a skilled veteran who no longer believes in the war, but continues to do so. Tom Berenger (in a perfect role), is the psychotic Sgt. Barnes, whose facial scars are a mirror for his life and personality. As the tension between the two sergeants rises, the platoon is torn apart when a simple battle has tragic consequences. i will not tell you what happens, but i will tell you this: as Elias runs across the field, the enemy in hot pursuit, he throws up his arms, as to ask ""why?"". perhaps this is the point of the film. why were we in Vietnam? Chris is transformed from a soft-spoken colledge boy into a bloodthirsty killing-machine. this may be the best film about Vietnam ever, but it's hard to tell. the enemy, however, is the strange part. you never clearly see them; they are just distant figures, fighting for a cause that the Americans really can never understand.",N/A
577054,"There is a lot of laugh value in having Ben Kingsley--he's Gandhi, after all--play a vicious mobster.  But what sustains this very interesting film is its brutal energy and intensity.The cast is superb down to the smallest part.  The film concerns a retired mobster, Gal (Ray Winstone) who is dragged back into the game one more time by Don Logan (Kingsley), a mobster who is very much still in the game and who, similar to Don Corleone, makes Gal an offer that he can't refuse.The most interesting part of the movie is not the heist (although I enjoyed this part of the film), but the will-he, won't-he momentum leading up to it.  Just how convincing is Don Logan?  And does he win in all this?  The answer to the first question is VERY effective--Kingsley is a profanity-spewing, intensely coiled monster.  I won't answer the second--you'll just have to see it for yourself.This is a great, intense film (a first film, directed by a former music video director).  It's loud, brash and occasionally brutal, but there are also moments of quiet tenderness between Gal and his wife, a former porn star (who is thus berated by Logan).  It is, in short, a powerhouse of a film, well worth eight bucks.A couple of warnings--I had a very tough time understanding the Cockney dialect for the first ten minutes or so.  The film is loaded with bad language and a little bit of nasty violence (although the worst of it occurs offscreen).",N/A
521410,"From the cool looking box to the actual movie, X-Men is one of the best movies I have ever seen.  The casting in this movie was excellent. Patrick Stewart makes the PERFECT Professor X just as Halle Berry makes the Perfect Storm.  Another thing I liked about the movie is that the creators decided to have the X-Men wear black suits instead of the colorful ones that are in the comic books.  This really helped the visual appeal of this movie, because it seemed less like a comic book and more like a movie.  The acting is this movie was suprisingly good as well, Xavier, Rogue, Storm and Magneto did a spectacular job as well as the other characters who are not well known actors (at least not to me.) The special effects in this movie were done perfectly, and were used in the right place at the right time.  Nothing was overdone in this movie.  I guess if I could find one bad thing about this movie is the fact that there were limited characters on each side, the X-Man in this movie were Storm, Wolverine, Cyclops, Jean Grey, Storm, Rogue and of course Charles Xavier.  On the other side, there was Sabertooth, Toad, Mystic and Magneto. However, from the talks I have been hearing, there WILL be a sequel and they will more than likely feature more characters.  I am hoping that the sequel will be just as good or possibly even better than the original.  I give this one 4.5 stars.",X-Men VHS

A photographer along for the ride is bitten by the spider and dies of convulsions, yet the cause of death remains unknown to everyone else, and so the body, along with the stowaway spider, is shipped back to his hometown of Canaima, where a new doctor is also moving in.Having moved from San Francisco to begin a practice in the small town, Dr. Ross Jennings, with his wife and two children, is dismayed when he learns that the previous doctor has decided not to retire. Beginning a practice of his own, he starts out with one patient, who is bitten by a deadly spider which was spawned in the barn in the backyard of Jennings' house. This, along with many other deaths, raise questions about the circumstances of the deaths, and as the facts are slowly revealed, the tension becomes increasingly delicious as the arachnids begin taking over the town.The mark of a truly good film is its ability to stay in touch with a certain message in its title in order for it to make sense. &quot;Arachnophobia&quot; is magnificent in its achievement of this goal, taking the minute fear of spiders and turning it into something quite suspenseful. This is done by placing a spider in almost every scene, and centering that specific part of the story around something that has to do with it, or them. One minute we see a lone creature, and the next there are thousands of them crawling across dry grass, up walls, and sometimes, on people.And these aren't the textbook spiders who merely hunt their prey from their spun webs and await some unsuspecting insect to fly into their trap. These arachnids are hunters, out for a taste of any kind of blood they can lay their fangs on. They are fast and unrelenting, vicious and brutal, and altogether extremely scary.The story is a well-spun (pardon the pun) piece of work which presents its elements well. The beginning takes things in stride by introducing us to the characters fluidly, and then slowly builds up to a heightened amount of suspense by placing those characters into extreme situations. We can care for what happens to the characters because we know who they are: Jennings' fear of spiders is presented, which comes into play with his confrontation with the spider.The spider makes a truly marvelous enemy, and Ross Jennings is an equally engrossing hero in the final act. Played by Jeff Daniels, his stand-off with the queen spider is just as good as any modern-day action sequence you'll see. We have a slight idea of what is going to happen, but Daniels' acting not only brings out the immense fear in his character, but keeps us at bay, wanting more until the climax reaches its peak. And to allay some of the tension comes John Goodman as an extremely hilarious exterminator who jumps in to save the day in his own little way.&quot;Arachnophobia&quot; does many different things for me: it certainly makes me think twice before reaching into my popcorn bowl, putting on my shoes or a football helmet. But, it also is a great ride, with lots of thrills and even more chills to please all. Fear will never be the same again!",N/A

323712,"What was Sidney Lumet thinking? his films are not usually derivative. Maybe he needed some quick cash, I don't know. Or maybe he agreed to make this movie before he knew that Melanie (I've talked this way since I was six) Griffith would be cast as the tough female cop who has to infiltrate Diamond District in New York City where many of the Chasidic Jews live.Actually, I'm not as surprised as most people that Griffith was cast in the first place; she was pretty gutsy in Something Wild. But she sleepwalks through this movie, as though she only took the part because she lost a bet. Her whole performance is laughable. She dyes her bleached hair brown for her &quot;cover&quot; as a Jew who has chosen &quot;tshuvah,&quot; to return from the secular world to an orthodox lifestyle. Reminds me of when Charlton Heston, acting in A Man for All Seasons, was too vain to remove his toupee, so he made the hairdressers paste a fake bald pate over his fake hair.Anyway, she's among the Chasidim ostensibly to solve the murder of a chasid who was murdered in a jewelry store, but aside from the finding of the body at the beginning, and the shoot'em up at the end, there's very little cop work. Griffith spends the middle part of the film having heart-to-hearts with the adopted daughter of the community's chief rebbe, making mistakes such as opening the dairy refrigerator on meat days, and swooning over Der Rebbe's adopted son, Ariel (means Lion of G-d).Ariel is the community's best Torah scholar, and this fact is established in a conversation with his sister, during which she says that Ariel &quot;studies Torah the way Mozart played the violin.&quot; This is merely one, and not the most serious of the errors in detail regarding Judaism. Never take the word of a female relative in assessing a Jewish man. To put it mildly, we exaggerate. They ALL walk on water.She has a failed seduction scene with him, which lacks any electricity or dramatic tension whatsoever. At the end, she has an epiphany, apparently because someone has for the first time, turned her down in order to wait for someone better. I'm not exactly sure of the logic of this; Ariel is waiting for his soulmate and won't settle for some shiksa, and from this, Griffith has now decided to wait for her soulmate too. Though, if I'm too understand the earlier innuendo, Griffith is a day late and a dollar short.Hard-core Griffith fans may like this, and people who really, REALLY like procedurals may prefer it to reruns of Diagnosis Murder, but don't watch it and expect to learn about Judaism.The impression I imagine those unfamiliar with Jewish customs would carry away is that Judaism is fraught with regulations and customs just waiting to be violated. It's nothing like that, really. Judaism is friendly, and upbeat, and not as dour as it is presented here.",N/A

556011,"While ballet purists knowledgeable in dance and technique might be put off by this film, balletomanes and lovers of dance films will find this movie a real treat. The plot is very Hollywood and predictable, but it's a predictability that is enjoyable to watch. Yes, you have your stereotypical characters, but there's still a ring of truth to them. As a former ballet student, I can tell you I've met all of these characters and then some. Unfortunately the movie exaggerates a few of the characters to the point of absurdity, such as the ballet mother. When her daughter Maureen admits her eating disorder, the ballet mother justifies the bulimia by saying her daughter is simply watching her weight. I find it hard to believe that any mother would approve of her daughter's bulimia, no matter how ambitious. Eating disorders are apparent in this film--one only has to look at the cast members to see that. Julie Kent is painfully thin and an all too-realistic reminder of ballet's stringent body requirements for female ballet dancers which drives them to anorexia and bulimia. I absolutely adored Zoe Saldana's scene-stealing character of the sassy Eva, and I think many dancers secretly wish they had her moxie. I don't feel Eva exists in the ballet world. She would have been thrown out of such a prestigious ballet school a long time ago-only choreographers and premier danseurs/prima ballerinas can get by with such behavior. Indeed, Eva's sudden substitution for Maureen in the student ballet is pure Hollywood fantasy--no way would Eva go undetected behind the scenes in an actual performance. But it's things like that which makes the movie so likeable. My only disappointment was discovering from the Director's Commentary that Saldana had a dance double for that dance sequence (except for closeup shots). Amanda Schull (a former Hawaii girl) is softly radiant as Jody Sawyer and does do her own dancing. Julie Kent dances exquisitely and Ethan Stiefel is simply amazing.",Center Stage VHS

Characters are introduced; past relationships are established (although it does take 178 episodes, seven series, three movies and eleven years for anything to come of it in the case of Riker and Troi). This is a must-have for any fan of the series - watching ""Encounter at Farpoint"" and comparing it to later episodes will allow you to see just how far the characters - Picard, Riker, Troi, Dr Crusher, Data, Worf, La Forge and Yar - have evolved and how the show as a whole changed over time.~*Jenna*~",N/A
539454,"I don't think there's a 10 second period that goes by without a joke. It is literally packed with comedy. None of it is bad, most is a amusing and a good portion is down right hilarious.The gist of the movie: Lord Farquaad (John Lithgow) is rounding up fairy tale creatures (When Geppetto turns in Pinocchio, he gets &quot;10 shillings for the possessed toy!&quot;) and because they can't coerce Shrek the ogre out of his swamp, they put all of the fairy tale creatures there. Shrek isn't all that happy about it, so raises a stink (literally and figuratively). Lord Farquad makes a deal to clear out Shrek's swamp if Shrek rescues a damsel in distress for him.My favorite: Lord Farquaad (the voice of John Lithgow is perfect for th part) is interrogating The Gingerbread Man (how'd he catch him anyway?) by dipping his legs in milk. The Gingerbread Man, gets tough during the torture and spits out, &quot;Eat me!&quot;.The movie was definitely made for both adults and children. Almost all of the jokes have an adult slant on them, but there are so many quirky, cute characters that the kids are sure to be entertained. Eddie Murphy as &quot;The donkey&quot; was, like John Lithgow, perfectly cast.

Based on the play by Tennessee Williams, it boasts a screenplay written by Williams and Gore Vidal, was directed by the ever-stylish Joseph L. Mankiewicz (""The Ghost and Mrs. Muir"", ""All About Eve""), and features an incredible cast led by Elizabeth Taylor and Katharine Hepburn.  Miss Taylor, looking every inch A Movie Star (her beauty is almost impossible to describe), gives a forcefully raw performance in the role of Catherine Holly, whose cousin Sebastian died under mysterious circumstances while the two of them were traveling abroad; while Miss Hepburn, every inch An Actress, is equally fascinating in the role of Sebastian's manipulative mother, Violet Venable.  These two actresses, each arguably the biggest star-icon of their generations, are introduced in long individual sequences, and when they finally confront one another, the thespic sparks really begin to ignite the screen!  Both received Best Actress Oscar nominations for their performances, and either would have been a worthy winner, but Simone Signoret got the trophy for ""Room at the Top"", possibly in part because Taylor and Hepburn split the votes.The DVD is yet another example of why Columbia/Tri-Star is the best company at packaging its classic films.  The disc offers: both widescreen and full-frame formats; theatrical trailers for this movie and three others (""Pal Joey"", ""Queen Bee"", and ""Mr. Smith Goes to Washington""); a video montage featuring production photographs and scene stills backed up with voice-overs from the soundtrack; a small selection of original release advertising materials; and brief talent files on the director and stars.

577405,"&#65533;Sunshine&#65533; is a forceful and wonderful film that follows four generations of a Jewish Hungarian family through seventy tumultuous years of Hungarian history.  The story is extremely well done with rich, finely etched characters.  The screenplay is better suited for a miniseries than a three hour film simply because there is so much material to cover.  Three hours is both too long and too short; the story is emotionally exhausting making it too long for one sitting, yet the total length is not long enough to do the subject matter justice.Hungarian Writer/Director Istvan Szabo captures Hungary&#65533;s turbulent transition from empire to fascist state to soviet satellite weaving the history of the times into the lives of this extraordinary family.  He puts a human face on the historical facts giving us a disturbingly real look at what it might have been like to live through it, especially from the Jewish perspective.Despite a whirlwind pace that requires years to be spanned in minutes, Szabo manages to conjure deep and insightful character studies of the members of each generation.  His period renderings are exquisite from costumes to props to locations.  This is a wonderfully textured presentation with history layered over the human stories, addressing the many indignities suffered by Jews in Hungary during the period, and the many concessions made to merely stay alive.  It is a story that contains both triumph and tragedy, presented with amazing candor.Ralph Fiennes gives three incredible performances as the grandfather, father and son of the patriarchy.  Szabo has endured criticism for casting the same actor in three roles, but in this case it is an excellent choice.  Fiennes is a versatile artist and personalizes three radically different characters, slipping on each personality like a custom fitted glove.  He loses himself in each, rendering them all passionately but appropriately based on the motivations established in Szabo's careful character development.  With Szabo&#65533;s guidance, it is clear that Fiennes has an inherent understanding of the psyche of his three characters and plays them with believable nuance.Two different actresses play Valerie and each is splendid.  Jennifer Ehle plays the young Valerie and endows her with ardor and vivacity.  She establishes Valerie as the strongest continuing character in the film, providing linkage between the past and the present.  In another stroke of casting brilliance, Szabo selects Ehle&#65533;s real life mother, Rosemary Harris as the elder Valerie.  The clear resemblance linked with Harris&#65533; magnetic performance adds fullness to Valerie&#65533;s later years.  William Hurt and James Frain lead an ensemble of strong supporting actors that give the film great intensity and depth of talent.This thoughtful and emotionally provocative character study is engrossing and compelling.  I rated it a 9/10 only because I wish Szabo would have gone deeper and divided it into two or three installments.  On a dramatic and artistic level, this film is first rate.",N/A

After popping this movie in once again, I found myself laughing more and harder than I did the first time.The supplemental DVD is outstanding.  All the extras on that extra disk added to the reason why you shouldn't hesitate on getting this DVD.

While it is written by some of the writers of Monty Python it can easily be enjoyed by those who don't get British humor. The story is excellent and the characters are unique. It is a great fantasy movie that both children and adults will love. This does not refer to any particular format.",Time Bandits VHS

It was a spectacular movie that not only had a great plot, but the CG was so detailed and well-done, you sometimes thought you were looking at real people. You feel a real attachment to the characters and their adventure to save man-kind. It combined so many emotional elements that it was a rollercoaster of a movie.

Liesel Matthews is charming and believable. She isn't directed to be &quot;cute&quot; but to be strong of will.I also like the variety of the adult characters. Too often in children's films, there are two kinds of adults: Oblivious parents and Mean Old Authority Figures. This movie has an attentive father, a wistful pushover, a kindly mystery man, a milkman lover ... even the &quot;evil schoolmistress&quot; has a human side that she denies.This is really an intelligent movie that doesn't talk down to the audience.

But what a total disappointment, a major waste of actors, crew, talent and money.I'll give credit to efforts of Renee, Morgan Freeman, et al. to do what they could to carry out a wretchedly implausible script.  Freeman, especially, shines.  He is truly a great, simpatico actor, for whose character in this non-epic one can almost feel sympathy.But the rest of it you can put back in the can.  Chris Rock, especially, disappoints.  He is a brilliant, pushing-the-edge comedian on HBO.  But here he's just another street-foulmouthed punk, a la Eddie Murphy at Murphy's trashmouth best (worst), like Murphy another self-inflicted waste of talent.Hollywood hubris, again.

528294,"A few caveats before the review:I had just read The God of Small Things, which is similarly infatuated/nostaligic about The Sound of Music. The Sound of Music was before my time: I do not have warm fuzzy feelings towards it: I'm sick of seeing it embedded in other fiction.(At this point, stop reading if you don't want to know how the film will end.)Second,as an American, I am probably reacting too emotionally to the way justice was dispensed. I am not be the best judge of what is a fair depiction of our legal system.If van Trier would have over-leapt the court room scenes, the lawyer scenes, and any interaction with the legal system, then we might have had a good movie. But he insisits on giving the Prosectution interminable minutes to make their case. On the other hand, Bjork's attorney is never shown saying anything. Bjork is put on the stand, grilled by Zeljko Ivanek as the Prosecution, with no explanation of why she is on the stand. Ivanek, a decent actor, seems to be used only because he looks like a sadist.Later Bjork gets a brand-spanking new lawyer who can get her off the hook. She cross-examines her lawyer to find where the money has come from; he cracks under the pressure, divulging the amount and thereby the source of the money. $2000 and change. When it comes to death penalty cases, $2000 will get your pulse checked to see if you are dead already; that's about it.There are, however, lawyers that take such cases pro bono. And let's see: blind young mother speaks English poorly--not an unattractive client for an attorney who has issues with the death penalty, oh no. And I submit is the only reason van Trier set the story in the United States is because the death penalty is still used here and thus Bjork can be made into an even bigger martyr.One other complaint: fiction that relies on fools not putting their money in a bank and then losing it or having it be stolen is at best unimaginative and desperate.I don't have any problem with the film technically. The jarring and the close-ups, which at times seem excessive, cumulatively have an undeniable power. The musical scenes fit well with how Selma deals with her world. I especially appreciated the opening scene of a painting being conceived, the growth and layering of colors.In short, I was very disappointed after being dazzled and shocked by Breaking the Waves.

576575,"It must be great to be Sandra Bullock.  Producing this picture, and being able to have fun with it, and still make money!  Sandra may not be a great actress, but she has real screen appeal, in the vein of Julia Roberts (who has more acting skill), because we feel she is real, and her personality shines through her characters.  She deserved the Golden Globe, and should have a long romantic comedy career.  Comedic timing and physical comedy?  She can and does do it in this film.Ensemble?  The casting director was incredibly fortunate to get Michael Caine to recreate his &quot;cunning twit&quot; role that he last shared with us as a scoundrel with Steve Martin.  He has some great lines, and it feels as though he has fun with his role. Candice Bergen, William Shatner &amp; Benjamin Bratt are all fun to watch, although none of them manages to go &quot;over the top&quot; and shine in this comedy.  Bullock should stick to the kind of leading men she had in &quot;While You Were Sleeping&quot; and &quot;28 Days&quot;.  (Sort of everyday heroes instead of face candy like Bratt and Ben Affleck, her leading man in &quot;Forces of Nature&quot;.)So...the target audience is really preteens, and I know they will love it and will wear out your DVD.  Make sure they get to see Sandra in her charming commentary piece, and also check out the funny outtakes. Nevertheless, everyone in the family will get a few chuckles out of this feel good movie.With this success under her belt, although panned by many critics, hopefully Bullock will be able to bring us another &quot;While You Were Sleeping&quot; in the not too distant future.",N/A
111563,"I don't know how I can expand on all of the praise that's already been given to the film, but I'll try. I've never seen the movie completely until a few weeks ago. I truly enjoyed it to the extent that it ranks in the top 5 of my favorite movies. It doesn't have a lot of action or suspense. What it does have is a great script, suberb acting by all and deservedly minimal direction. Honestly, I'm not a huge Bogart fan - I think he was way over-the-top in Maltese Falcon, but in Casablanca he is truly a gem to watch. I can feel for his pain and suffering as he relives old feelings. Ingrid Bergman is always a pleasure to watch and she shows why she was one of the best leading ladies in Hollywood. The rest of the cast is also good, even Peter Lorrie in a very small (but important) role. This movie tells a story that is still relevant today - it's all about the decisions you make in life. How some of them are not the best and if you're lucky, you may get a chance to redeem yourself later. Wether the story is set against the backdrop of World War II or today, it's still a story that has meaning to everyone. I bought this just to see what all the fuss was about.

528410,"When I rented this movie I really had no idea what to expect.  I had heard all sorts of things about its style and how Bjork said she'd never do another movie after this one, so I figured there must be something to it.  I was not disappointed.  First off, this film is a musical.  A very modern day musical.  Lars von Trier was able to shoot the musical pieces using 100 digital video cameras placed around the set at one time.  This is mind boggling.  His idea was to do the number once and just capture it that way, but it didn't work out to well and they had to do mulitple takes.  But just appreciating the idea behind this portion of the film must spark your interest for the dramatic portions of it.  Bjork is amazing.  I would like to see her do more films, but I know it probably won't happen, sadly enough.

101942,"All the President's Men (Alan Pakula, 1976)We has met the enemy, and they is more ours than we realized they was. Pakula's fact-based look at the way Woodward (Robert Redford) and Bernstein (Dustin Hoffman) uncovered the story behind the Watergate break-in is a classic piece of filmmaking that's influenced almost every, if not every, piece of film and television dealing with journalism that's come since in America. Most, thankfully, are a little more coherent than this, but the confusion factor doesn't make All the President's Men any less a film.Much of what allows All the President's Men to straddle the line between confusing mush and classic filmmaking is in that everpresent devil, the details. Want an example? The main theme of the film is that words are weapons; the unforgettable opening sequence, in which the typewriterkeys strike the paper with seemingly epic force, is the result of mixing whip and shotgun sounds with the actual sounds of typewriter keys. Now that's attention to detail, folks. As well, Pakula never allows the story to stray from the straight and narrow. Woodward and Bernstein remain the focus throughout, and while some minor characters get enough screen time to be memorable (Jason Robards' performance as Ben Bradlee garnered him a very well-deserved Best Supporting Actor oscar), we don't need to know who they all are; their function in the film is solely to either funnel information to, or keep information from getting to, Woodward and Bernstein. We don't need to know anything else about them. It adds a little kick to know trivial details, such as the guy playing Frank Wills (the security guard who discovers the break-in initially) actually was the late Frank Wills, but it's not necessary to comprehend the story of what started as a routine newspaper article about a hotel burglary and ended up being a series of articles that won the Pulitzer Prize, changed the face of political reporting in America, and incidentally saved Bob Woodward's job at the Washington Post. *** 1/2",N/A

588883,"He defeated Sonny Liston in 1964 for the heavyweight title, and shortly thereafter converted to Islam and changed his name to Muhammad Ali; was stripped of the title a few years later; reclaimed the heavyweight title by defeating George Foreman in 1974.  He was Cassius Marcellus Clay.  He is ""The Greatest"".But is ""Ali"" the greatest?To begin, ""Ali"" shows that there is more to Ali's life than boxing, that the fiery charisma he radiates extends beyond the ring.  His conversion to Islam and his proud defiance in refusing to be inducted into the U.S. army are as dynamic as his in-ring demeanors.  In addition, he is also surrounded by some interesting personalities:Angelo Dundee (Ron Silver) - Ali's faithful trainerHoward Cosell (Jon Voight) - sportscaster whose on-camera tussles with Ali, in which Cosell takes all the comedic beatings, masks a deep friendship between the two'Bundini' Brown (Jamie Foxx) - Ali's moral supporter who has disappointed him in more ways than oneMalcolm X (Mario van Peebles) - influential speaker for the nation of Islam, the catalyst of Ali's Islam conversion, and with whom Ali forged a mutual respect and social beliefsCassius Sr.(Giancarlo Esposito) - an artist, and Ali's father though not a very good one in his opinionElijah Muhammad (Albert Hall) - the conservative head of the Nation of Islam, and the one responsible for giving Ali his current nameHerbert Muhammad (Barry Shabaka Henley) - son of Elijah, and Ali's not-so-dependable managerDon King  (Mykelti Williamson) - boxing promoter whose flamboyance is rivaled only by his love of making moneyHoward Bingham (Jeffrey Wright) - Ali's no-nonsense agent and best friendChauncey Eskridge (Joe Morton) - Ali's reliable attorneyAnd he is also a ladies' man.  Who can forget his bevy of wives which he has captured in suave but poetic fashion - the first Sonji Roi (Jada Pinkett Smith), the second Belinda Boyd (Nona M. Gaye), and the third Veronica Porsche (Michael Michele) whom he met in Zaire prior to the Ali-Foreman bout but did not marry onscreen.  Plus, the closing lines stated that he took one more wife.  Let's not forget his longsuffering mother Odessa (Candy Ann Brown).The screenplay covering Ali's prominent moments of his professional career does not deviate from historical facts.  They are presented in three parts: the beginning part details his entry into fame with the Ali-Liston fight, his conversion and name change, and his associations with Macolm X; the middle part focuses on his trials, vindication and the Ali-Frazier fight; the final part culminates on the Ali-Foreman fights.  Director Michael Mann does a terrific job in keeping these three parts distinct.  However, he spotlights almost exclusively on Ali's public life in the final part.  He also included some scenes that are better left out, as they are more unimportant than informative.  Chief among them being cameos by LeVar Burton as Martin Luther King in only one scene - the assassination scene - and Malick Bowens as despotic Zairian president Mobutu dining in his palace.  So we know these two political figures exist, but what purpose do their scenes serve?  Another distraction is the excessive coverage of Malcolm X, which includes his assassination shown in gratuitous gore.  Even with the coverage minimized, his liasons with Ali would still be effectively presented, instead of taking up nearly the entire beginning part.As the Champ, Will Smith is The Greatest.  He captures the iconic personality perfectly, which Mann successfully translates to film with adept close-up shots while zooming out appropriately to capture Ali's flamboyant speeches.  His boxing sequences are riveting, thanks largely to Michael Bentt, James Toney and Charles Shufford, who play Sonny Liston, Joe Frazier and George Foreman respectively.  They are interspersed with slow motion sequences to heighten the hair-raising tension of getting clobbered by a devastating uppercut.  Although the actual fights themselves are far less dramatic than Mann's version.  Foxx is surprisingly impressive in a non-comedy role, even adding some comedy routines of his own without disrupting the drama.  Another great performance of mention is Voight being almost unrecognizable as Cosell with his conspicuous toupee and his stiff but somewhat goofy portrayal.  Now we know he can do comedy.""Ali"" concludes immediately after Ali's victory over Foreman, which seems abrupt.  The tensions between the Champ and Belinda was neither fully played out nor resolved.  I was half-expecting it to continue with Ali divorcing her and moving on to marry his third.  Indeed, ""Ali"" certainly floats like a butterfly and stings like a bee, but is overshadowed by Will Smith and the larger-than-life icon that he portrays.  Don't be disappointed if Muhammad Ali himself does not appear at all.",Ali

It's dark with a lot of twists and yet, at the same time, lighthearted and humorous.AMERICAN BEAUTY takes place in a modern-day suburban American town. It basically revolves around two particular families living next door to each other in a quiet neighborhood. The first family: the Burnhams - Lester Burnham (Kevin Spacey), Carolyn Burnham (Annette Bening), and Jane Burnham (Thora Birch). Lester is the father, and he is going through a mid-life crisis. He has even fallen in love with Jane's new friend, Angela Hayes (Mena Suvari) by her beauty. Caroyln is the perfect mother who has to have everything perfect - everything and everyone. Jane is the rebellious teenager who can't seem to appreciate anything her parents give her or do for her.Family number two: the Fitts - Colonel Frank (Chris Cooper), Barbra (Allison Jenny), and Ricky (Wes Bentley). The Colonel Frank is the father, a retired US miltary colonel who is hard on his son - to the point of abusive - and even though he claims his son is a homosexual, he is actually a homosexual himself, though you don't really find that out until the end. Barbra is mainly silent throughout this film, and doesn't have a lot of lines so you can't really know what her character is like, though she often forgets and is lost in her daydreams a lot. Ricky is the son, and he films everything that is beautiful or interesting to him - which is how he and Jane meet, because he was filming her all the time. He also is very confident and calm about everything, and is afraid of his father, though he never likes showing or admiting it.A beautiful film about a man in his mid-life crisis and falling for the beauty of his teenage daughter's best friend. The ending is very surprising, and the film didn't really live up to all of my expectations....The bonus added stuff to AMERICAN BEAUTY is really good, but couldn't they have just added the special edition stuff to the same video tape as the movie itself because then this wouldn't have to be a double video. Oh well. This is still a very good movie, and I really recommend it. But I don't think it really deserved all those Oscars. I really think THE SIXTH SENSE still should've won Best Picture.

The hack-job English dubbing doesn't do the movie any favors, especially a party scene which might have made sense in Japanese but speaks more about the lack of comprehension by whoever dubbed the movie when viewed in English.

Try and find this movie in the original Japanese with subtitles, it makes a bit more sense that way. Though you'll want the dubbed English version first.

While the special effects are impressive,and the director's distinctive visual style displayed in full regalia, DePalma's main strength here lies in giving the audience some genuine emotional involvement with the characters, which is rare in a sci-fi movie. For sure, the script could have snagged a few more IQ points in places,and that organ music does start to grate on you like a Rick Wakeman solo, but I really think DePalma was just out to make an entertaining &quot;popcorn&quot; adventure film, as opposed to an Important Statement.

506569,"Who could resist listening to Richard Burton perform Hamlet?  Shakespeare is about the poetry and the heart of poetry is the voice in which it is spoken.  Burton's voice gives a life and passion to the role which is wonderful.  Add to his the voices of John Gielgud as the ghost and Hume Cronyn as Polonius and what more could a person want?How about seeing it?  Granted, the film quality here is not up to the standards of a modern audience.  First of all, this is a recording of an actual Broadway performance and not a true film so the lighting is bad and there aren't as many close-ups as one would expect in a movie.  But the darkness and black and white filming actually give the show a moodiness appropriate to the story of Hamlet.  Still, there are moments where facial expressions are difficult to make out because of distance and lighting; however, there are also moments of extreme beauty.On the whole, whatever one might think of the filming, there are a number of good performances here.  Burton is, of course, wonderful despite the fact that he leans a little more towards madness than I read into the character.  Cronyn plays Polonius with an intelligence often missing in actors who see this character as an old fool.  Linda Marsh makes a good attempt at Ophelia which may be the most difficult female character in the Shakespearean canon but it is not definitive.  None of the characters was weak so the overall effect is wonderful.The staging of this version is also worthy of noting.  It is done on an almost bare stage with the actors in modern &quot;street clothes.&quot;  Many people dislike this kind of minimalist theatre but I enjoy it.  It takes the focus away from the set and puts it on the actors, where it belongs.  All too often in modern theatre (and film) the set overshadows the acting when it should just be there as a support.Ultimately, people expecting a movie on the order of recent films by the likes of Mel Gibson and Kenneth Brannagh will be disappointed.  People who enjoy going to live theatre, however, and who love to hear the beauty of Shakespeare's words will find this film a worthy addition to their collections.",N/A

The movie really clicks because of some of the main actor's wonderfull potrayols of some of the characters. For one, Ellen Burstyn is simply sensational in her lead role as a tough mother who must watch as her innocent daughter is possesed by a foul mouthed demon, Pazuzu. Burstyn is a wonderful, talented actress and she played the role so well, it's like she's not acting! Jason Miller as Preist/Psychiatrist Father Damien Karras is just great. His quilt ridden character, fearing that he is losing his faith, is duplicated so very well by Miller's performance, his facial expressions, the way he talks, his eyes.... he's very convincing in this important role. Max von Sydow, as old FatherMerrin, is also very, very good. He was covered in thick layers of make-up to look older than he really was, and he still acted great. Wonderfull job that I feel deserved an Oscar. Lee J. Cobb, in a pretty much unimortant and gratuitous role, is still quite stunning. He plays Detective William F. Kinderman, a fan of movies as well as a sly investigator. Well done. Father Karras' sick mother is portrayed by Vasiliki Maliaros, and although she didn't ever make another movie, she's excellent as an old, dieing woman who stays sweet to her son. Now, of course, you can't forget Linda Blair, can you? No. I don't think anyone who sees this movie could forget Linda Blair as the demon possesed 12 year old girl. Mrs. Blair received an Acadamy Award Nomination for this movie, and I say it was well deserved. Although her voice was dubbed over by Mercedes McCambridge and the gross-out scenes were done with Eileen Deitz (is that spelled right?), Mrs. Blair does some sensational things in this movie. It's the way she let herself go and just acted that made her performance unforgettable. The directing on this film is quite good. It's been reported that director William Freidkan beat up his cast and crew to get a good reaction on-screen (he even fired guns to make people look surprised) but I beleive that's what made the acting so good. The writing on this is also good. William Peter Blatty adapted his bestseller book into a movie and I think he did a good job. He didn't change much from the book, but his adaption does the book faithfully and his script is well written, especially in the first half (those medical examination scenes give me the creeps).Some people have said the movie is only about a girl who gets possesed and spews pea soup and has sex with a crucifix, but this movie does have a message. It's quite difficult to find, and I know that when I first watched the movie, I thought it had nothing to do with faith, but after several repeated veiwings, I can see what the message is. There are several scenes about faith and it's faith that is needed to save the poor little girl, Reagan, but Father Karras is losing his. The film has a strong moral behind all the possesion scenes, but it's hard to find.The Exorcist has already gone through two DVD releases, one of poorer quality than the others. The second release, the 25th Anniversary Special Edition, was very good, full of extras and a beautiful transfer for the picture and sound, but this ""Version You've Never Seen"" release is slightley better, yet slightley poorer. The picture and sound on this one are far better than the previous release, much less film grain and brighter colors. The sound is in a new Dolby Digital 5.1 soundtrack that is quite spectacular. The new version adds scenes, which blend in seamlessly, as well as some discarded musical cues that help add to the tension. The new scenes flesh out the characters and the reason behind the girl's possesion, and there's also the shocking ""Spider-walk"" which really made me jump. I won't tell you what happens, but it's quite a surprise! There are also some new CGI effects that I feel add to the creepiness, also. The new epilouge between Father Dyer (Rev. William O' Malley) and Detective Kinderman (Lee J. Cobb) was mostly hated by fans and criticts (including Roger Ebert) but I like it a lot. At first I didn't think much of it, but now, having seen the third film, I can see why this scene's important (Dyer and Kinderman are good freinds in Part 3). We've also got an extended scene of Merrin's arrival at the house, him asking Reagan's middle name, a conversation on the stairs in a break in the exorcism, a slightley longer beggining, a new medical examination scene near the beggining, as well as a scene of Father Karras examining a recording of Reagan before she got possesed (very helpful). Those are the good things about this DVD, but the bad things are there, too. The disk seems to lack in any special features. Sure, you got some interesting notes, trailers (for the 2000 version) and a commentary, but it's not nearly as packed as the 25th Anniversary disk, which has TWO commentaries, a very insightfull 76 minute documentary, trailers, cast index, and a few more things. This disk has a different commentary by director Freidkan than the other disk, and this one is far worse. It's a commentary in which the director gives almost no insight into the making of the film (except at the beggining) and goes for basically saying ""In this scene Reagan steals a cookie from the cookie jar and Chris chases her to get it back"" or ""Chris asks Karras if Reagan will die and he sais 'No'"". Not a good commentary. I like the trailers and Radio Spots, though. They're quite well done.The movie, as I said, looks great. Occasional grain comes, but not to often and the print is quite breathtaking (this movie was made in 1973?). It's presented in its original widescreen format and it features a 5.1 track, a Mono, and French sub-titles.So, anyway, I'd say you decide which Exorcist DVD you like best. You must at least rent the 25th Anniversary disk and watch the wonderful documentary, but I say this version is better.",N/A

187231,"Upon its original release this movie was far more successful in overseas market than in the United States (not surprisingly, as two of its stars, Ursula Andress and Toshiro Mifune, were bigger stars in their respective home markets than pre-&quot;Death Wish&quot; Charles Bronson was in the States).  But I would say that &quot;Red Sun&quot;'s reputation as an &quot;Art House&quot; favorite still shouldn't keep American Western fans from giving it a look, even those casual fans of the genre who believe that a Western requires either the presence of Clint Eastwood or John Wayne for a Western to be considered any good.&gt;As a point-of-reference for those whose tastes in Westerns (or movies in general) run along more contemporary lines, I would categorize &quot;Red Sun&quot; as an &quot;Old School&quot; variation of &quot;Shanghai Noon&quot; (that takes itself far more seriously).  The obvious hook for the movie is the &quot;East Meets West&quot; theme, as well as the &quot;discipline vs. lawlessness&quot; and &quot;faith vs. betrayal&quot; conflicts that provide additional energy to the story.  If the multiple subplots aren't enough, there is a brief frontal nude shot of Ursula Andress that makes it easy to remember why she was cast in &quot;Dr. No&quot; (and was thus subsequently identified in &quot;Trainspotting&quot; as &quot;THE quintessential 'Bond girl'&quot;) in the first place.&gt;Now, the quality of the DVD itself isn't that good, I'm afraid.  Yes, it is formatted, which for a Spaghetti Western qualifies as a crime against humanity.  The transfer itself is as good as can be expected, going on the questionable quality of the original print.  There aren't any additional features (a documentary piece regarding the international quality of the cast would have been interesting at the least, but the movie likely wasn't considered worthy of such pretention at the time it was made).&gt;In truth, if I hadn't found the DVD used (I'm not even sure if they're actively being printed anymore), I probably wouldn't've bought it at full price.  I'm hoping that its &quot;limited availability&quot; at this time means that someone (hopefully the folks who re-issued &quot;Repo Man&quot; and &quot;The Wicker Man&quot;) will put together a proper re-issue package for this film.  Surely Charles Bronson fans alone at least deserve that much.&gt;In conclusion, I do recommend this movie to anyone who has a soft spot for Westerns and/or abstract productions...it's not one of Mifune's best works, but it is (all things considered) one his more interesting efforts as an actor.  I just wish this DVD included a better presentation.",N/A
435612,"&quot;Cobra&quot; is an interesting movie in that it shows just how much movies have changed over the past fifteen years.  I don't think a studio would put out a movie like this today.  Special effects have altered the action movie landscape forever.  And the storylines have changed, too.  You wouldn't see a movie where a bunch of zombie-like killers stalking the streets makes up the main plot.  Thus, &quot;Cobra&quot; is the last of its kind.  Stallone does a decent job, but this film marked a slowdown in his career (it came out right after his 1985 hit &quot;Rambo II&quot;).  It wasn't until the mid-90s that he began to revitalize his career with &quot;Cliffhanger&quot; and &quot;Judge Dredd&quot; (pretty good movies, in my opinion).",Cobra

She plays Pearl, a young mother who feels that she missed her teenage life as she was married way too young. Liev Schreiber plays her husband and Viggo Mortensen is the blouse man with whom she has an affair with. Anna Paquin plays her daughter. Tony Goldwyn (the bad guy from Ghost) direct. The DVD is wonderful. The picture quality is very good and Dolby 5.1 is great during Woodstock. I would have given it 5 stars if not for the lack of extra features.

The problem is there is no character development and no time is spent to really flesh out any kind of storyline.

I especially liked the hints as to who will end up marrying each other; nice touch. Preserving Akane requires a special sacrifice from Ranma. Will he be willing?  Does he really, ummmm, Love her?Bad point: The cute innocence of the series is lost with a bit too much skin. One might conclude that the REAL plot centers on who is the ultimate babe -- Nabiki or Ukyo? Both are animated as fabulous babes, wearing revealing bikinis, but where's the humor? (The series has Shampoo providing humorous contrast to Ranma's repeated complaints about Akane. Shampoo can cook, fight, is madly in love with Ranma and also happens to be THE ultimate babe. It's enough to make guys sigh &quot;Ranma, don't be such an idiot!&quot;)Overall: It's an enjoyable movie, but don't be surprised if females get disgusted from the slow pans of the jiggling Nabiki and quivering Ukyo. On the other hand, otaku guys into this stuff will think this is the best ever. Ranma 1/2 collectors will want to get this, but might think about getting the OVA Series first.

37321,"Baseball is a game that reflects, in many but not all ways, America. Because of this, Ken Burns has decided to use the history of baseball as a vehicle for one of his sanctimonious sermons - in this case, civil rights - just as he did with the Civil War and has done with Jazz.  The struggle for racial equality is an element of the baseball story, but it is not the baseball story.The ripoff here is seen in the black players who are interviewed.  Burns elicits only half-hearted testimony that, yes, there was discrimination and, yes, it's good that the black leagues are extinct, thanks to Jackie Robinson and his successors.  It would be a crime against Burns's political correctess to say anything else, but it's not that hard to see through the cant, for it is obvious that these players loved oplaying the game, regardless of where they played.  But Burns disingenuously tries to portray them as the miserable victims of a plantation culture.If you really want to puke, just try to get through Burns's attempt to make baseball a struggle for *gender* equality!Burns flogs sentiment for every drop he can extract.  How many times must we hear the Star Spangled Banner or Take Me Out to the Ball Game rendered as variations on a hymn?  How often must we feel ourselves being manipulated by the slow, stately, pretentious narration?  If we didn't understand English, we would be hard pressed to say, by the narration alone, whether we're listening to Ken Burns's version of the Civil War or Baseball.But there is a big difference between warfare and a non-contact game (unless you define baseball by Ty Cobb) and, though Burns would have us think otherwise, a game is just a game.  Fun.  A film about a game should be fun, too.

However, after the reign of the emperor Commodus (portrayed in this flick by Christopher Plummer), the empire never was quite as powerful as it had been while the Aurelian emperors ruled.

61786,"This is not really the drum I march to, but I do have to give credit where credit is due. First, I will say that this movie DOES NOT hide behind effects or excessive obscenities. Nor does it try to force feed us any politics. Well, let me start on the film's merits. Fox's first bit of ill fortune is dramatic BUT plausible. (Good!) His desperate run to his distant uncle is drawn well. Although he does not really state his frustraion at the job he manages to get, we can clearly see it. (Great!) The company is drawn well. To put this in civil language, the certain breeches of sacramental promises, the favors given of a PG 13 nature for promotions on the job, the suits who have the childish  'I'm going to tell' attitude, the suits who can never figure out what to do, and the rare suits like Davis who try to be honest and do their job right, all give us a very realistic picture of this kind of environment. The mail room is also drawn very well. Mel and Fox's boss are very well drawn! I was in a situation once where the workers on the low  end of the scale clearly had a higher sense of awareness of what was going on. There were the very few Davises (the more honest and honorable suits), but most of the suits did not fall into this category. Mel clearly shows us someone who has little if anything to lose; so he does not delude himself into going along with the present politics of the environment; he is aware of what goes on; he is cautious to avoid interaction with people better avoided; and his loyalty to Fox is clearly drawn. Fox's boss is also very well drawn. Unlike the suits in charge, he is not smooth. Rather he is quite loud. Somehow, we are given the impression that he is on the intelligent side. At one point, he displays understandable frustration at the suits: 'This is a messenger service! Not a car service!&quot; I DO NOT think it was an accident that this is the character who was the FIRST one to stumble across finding Fox's double game. I don't want to ruin the ending for those of you who have not seen it. So I will just say, it is a memorable fight between politics and reality. Chances are, you will never find this movie boring. The scenery may not be Franco Zeffirelli's, but it is surprisingly well done. If you see this movie, pick it up.",N/A

This is a 2-disc set loaded with extras, but how good are they? 20th Century Fox puts out some of the best DVD releases around, and this is no exception. The running commentary is by 5 or 6 people, including director Robert Zemeckis, but it is dominated by discussion on sound effects, followed only by visual effects. I found this to be very enlightening, but it started to get repetitive toward the end of the film. I mean, there are only so many ways to say how wind and water sounds replaced music in the film. I was also disappointed that other topics weren't discussed. Fortunately, all of the featurettes included on the 2nd disc take care of the commentary's missing information. In hindsight, it actually seems like careful planning on Fox's part as there is a document for almost every aspect of the production. There is a featurette describing the island location, one describing the story of Wilson, small snippets on visual effects, Charlie Rose's interview with Tom Hanks describing his experiences, and a documentary about the research done for surviving on a deserted island. Anything left out is covered in the above-standard &quot;making-of.&quot;  Fox has once again done a wonderful job with a DVD release: elegant, animated menus and content that has been well thought-out and full of interesting information.

Faye Dunaway gives a fairly polished performance as the renowned but fragile photographer Laura Mars who has the uncanny ability to recreate (using live models) violent crime scenes that have taken already place. This ability does not escape the attention of a local police officer, John Neville played by Tommy Lee Jones in an early acting role. The relationship between John and Laura is both tender and brittle. Both are damaged people with secrets to hide and both fear exposure of the truth behind Laura's gift of second-sight.

12000,"Every 4th of July I watch ""1776,"" the musical that has our Founding Fathers singing and dancing their way to Independency, and every time John and Abagail Adams sing goodbye to each other (""Till Then"" and ""Yours, Yours, Yours""), I get choked up.  William Daniels has his role of a lifetime as John Adams, the obnoxious and disliked Massachusetts delegate to the Continental Congress who is the most fervent advocate of independence (""Piddle, Twiddle and Resolve"").  Virginia Vestoff plays his wife Abigail, and their exchanges are based on the ""Dearest Friend"" correspondences they wrote to each other during the crucial summer of 1776.  However, the most unforgettable performance in ""1776"" comes from Howard Da Silva as Dr. Benjamin Franklin.  The actor, who played movie villains for years, manages to convey not only Franklin's wit but also his firm belief in the new race of ""Americans.""  Ken Howard plays Thomas Jefferson and joins with Adams and Franklin in the show's two cutest numbers, ""But, Mr. Adams"" and ""The Egg.""  I have never cottoned ""The Lees of Old Virginia,"" the song sung by Richard Henry Lee (Ron Holgate) and where every lyric line ends with ""LY,"" but at the other end of the spectrum is the chilling ""Molasses to Rum to Slaves,"" the song about the Triangle Trade sung by South Carolina's Edward Rutledge (John Cullum).  The ensemble cast brings the Second Continental Congress alive, with Roy Poole as Stephen Hopkins, David Ford as John Hancock and William Hansen as Caesar Rodney standing out.  Most of the cast members were in the Tony Award winning original Broadway cast, although Blythe Danner replaces Betty Buckley as Martha Jefferson (""He Plays the Violin"").Peter Stone's book is remarkably accurate in relating the historical events; the biggest error a historian would point to is that John Dickinson (Donald Madden), did not show up the day of the crucial vote so that Pennsylvania would not kill Independence.  But Broadway and Hollywood must be allowed to make things more dramatic.  What makes ""1776"" so wonderful is how it teaches history while being so entertaining.  The opening of the film, where the tirade by Mr. Adams against the do nothing Continental Congress is interrupted by the collective Founding Fathers jumping up and singing ""Sit Down, John,"" sets the tone and Peter H. Hunt's film delivers throughout.  The show's best moment comes in ""Is Anybody There?"" when John Adams, all alone in the quiet chamber, dreams of the pomp and pageantry of a free America.I also have the laserdisc version, which runs 176 minutes and includes 35 minutes of material originally cut from the film, including the song ""Cool, Considerate Men"" and alternative shots in several sequences.  While the quality of the additional material is in very sad shape, fans of ""1776"" will take what they can get.  Hopefully the complete film can be restored before we get to the DVD version (hint, hint, hint).  Granted, the idea of a musical about the Declaration of Independence seems bizarre; I once blew off a chance to see ""1776"" on stage because I thought the idea was stupid.  But this is a first-rate musical that makes the time and issues come alive, so that even thought we obviously know the outcome, we are enthralled because it looks like Mr. Adams will never get his Declaration adopted.  If you are looking for a film to watch each 4th of July, ""1776"" is the one.",N/A
577546,"I'm a dog owner myself, not that I show my dogs.  I couldn't they're Mutts.  However, I do enjoy watching the occasional Dog Show.  I was a little skeptical about this movie, because I just didn't think the material lent itself to a feature film.The movie chronicles four different groups of dog owners and their adventures and misadventures on the way to the Mayflower Dog Show in Philadelphia.  The story continues with the actual competition.  The commentators for the show are actually the best part of the movie.Given this, I would say that this is a pretty good movie.  Its not hysterical by any means, but it is enjoyable.  The movie is slow going for the first 30 minutes or so, but by the time the actual Dog Show starts, it has developed into a funny tale in which you realize its not the dog's fault, it's just that humans are insane to put this much crazy effort into showing a dog.

562945,"Actually, I rate this movie 3 1/2 stars, but that isn't an option here, so I'll give it 3 stars plus a thumbs up. Most of what the other customer reveiwers had to say was true, though a bit exagerated in a few cases. I do disagree with much of what the Amazon reveiwer, Bruce Reid, had to say. For example, as to the kids' over-repeating their moral indignation. When real kids get something this big on their minds (they learn that their Japanese/American buddy and his family are to be sent to an internment camp) they are like a broken record! If anything, this is understated, not overstated. Another place Reid is wrong is about the musical score. It does no hammering at all. In fact, it happens to be Samuel Barber's Adagio for Strings, for the most part, and seems quite appropriate.The film's bright spot is its young stars, and it is no stretch to call these four kids stars, because they surely do shine. They are all good actors, and I must say that I was most surprised and impressed by Trevor Morgan, who left me cold in The Sixth Sense as an antagonist. Here he is not only a protagonist but the central character in the story, and the difference in his performance is remarkable. He is very natural most of the time, but this, especially with kids, has a lot to do with the writing, which I'm sorry to say is so spotty and irregular that it swiftly becomes the Achilles heel of this movie.At times, though, the writing combines delightfully with the superb natural acting of the boys (if indeed it is acting rather than just these four kids being their natural selves with the dialog given them). Their best scene is near the beginning, when the four of them fling themselves onto the bed and read a letter sent to Duke (Trevor Morgan) by his brother Anthony, who is a soldier seeing action in the War. They laugh and giggle and wiggle and hang upside down, all the while making comments that are so natural that the whole scene could have been entirely ad-libbed.However, this level of dialog does not hold up, and there are times when the overall quality of the movie in all respects seems to be wavering at the edge of an abyss. Fortunately, it never goes over the edge, and we are rewarded in the end with an overall favorable experience. You can poke fun at the story all day long, but in the end it must be said that there is more than enough that is good in this movie to place it a notch above the usual &quot;kids save the world&quot; children's adventure story.I titled this review, &quot;Good, should have been much better.&quot; I'll stick with that. The kid actors are so good, in fact, that they alone are able to carry the movie, even towards the end when their dialog occasionally borders on the insipid and jarring. You go along thinking one minute you're watching a film that will be among your all-time faves, and the next minute wondering what in the world the writer(s) and director could have been thinking of!

But when I was 10 getting up on a Saturday morning to watch it the American version is what I saw and I couldn't get enough of it. I didn't buy this DVD to get the Japanese version although they are very interesting and I do like them more. But I bought it as something from my youth. A show that I just couldn't get enough of and something to share with my kids. Sure 7-Zark-7 is campy beyond belief. But I don't mind. For now I will show kids the American version with it's more family ideals and when they are a little older they can watch whichever version they want. I was just happy that the Americans did a version. Because if they didn't then I probobly would not have seen it as a kid and found a love for anime.,N/A
528987,"I did not see Almost Famous at the theater but looked forward to seeing the film on DVD.  I was not disappointed.From Patrick Fugit as William Miller, the young writer, to Frances McDormand as his mother, to Billy Crudup as the lead guitarist of the band that William goes on tour with, the performances are extraordinary.  When you add in Kate Hudson in a luminescent role as Penny Lane, a groupie (excuse me, Band-aid) and Philip Seymour Hoffman as the editor of Creem magazine, you have a film that is like a great desert.  You savor each scene, and can't wait to see what happens next.The DVD is crisp in terms of audio and crystal clear in terms of video.  The soundtrack, which could have been either predictable or purposefully obtuse turns out to be just right.  If you can make it through the &quot;Tiny Dancer&quot; scene without a smile on your face, you are unsalvageable.I did not particularly enjoy the seventies.  I was exactly the age of William in this film, but actually enjoyed the music of the fifties and early sixties better at the time.  (I am the product of a family that listened to early Elvis, country, and classic fifties rock).  However, this film gives me an appreciation of the era.Cameron Crowe captures the feel of a segment of society that has come through the late sixties flower-power era and has developed a hard-edge, in things like their drug use and their attitudes towards money and success. At the same time, he portrays them as what they truly were - just kids who wanted to make music, write, be part of the scene, but, at the same time, realized that being successful at what they did was not necessarily a bad thing.Buy this DVD and enjoy it.  It is not the perfect masterpiece that certain people have professed it to be, but it is darned close and that is more than I can say for most of the films I have seen in the last 5 years.",Almost Famous

I prefer the Dolby Surround sound on the widescreen tape to the Dolby Digital 5.1 sound on the DVD.

573455,"On the surface, this is a fun (albeit minor) murder mystery made special by the performances of an all-star cast.  When a local resident is poisoned at a reception for a film crew on location in a small English village, Agatha Christie's resourceful Miss Marple character begins to piece together the story of whodunit. In her only film appearance (to date) as Marple, Angela Lansbury is marvelously warm, wise, and witty.  Her earnest performance is complimented beautifully by those of Elizabeth Taylor and Kim Novak, who seem to relish their roles as feuding movie queens with tongues of acid.  Geraldine Chaplin also scores as a long-suffering agent who is secretly in love with Taylor's husband (Rock Hudson).  As the men in the mystery, Hudson, Tony Curtis as a film producer, and (especially) Edward Fox as Lansbury's nephew all do fine work, but the spotlight remains fittingly focused on the distaff characters throughout.The movie would be a harmlessly fun little romp if it weren't for one underlying conceit which taints the screenplay (as well as the novel on which it is based).  Unfortunately --- and unforgivably --- the essential plot is nothing more than a cynical and tasteless exploitation of an actual tragedy that had a devastating and life-long effect on the lives of Hollywood beauty Gene Tierney (&quot;Laura&quot;) and her first husband, Oleg Cassini.  What was Dame Christie thinking when she so callously and obviously mined Tierney's heartbreak as fodder for a piece of fiction during the actress' lifetime?  If you're unfamiliar with the details, you may choose to go ahead and enjoy the movie ... and then look for a copy of Gene Tierney's best-selling autobiography, &quot;Self-Portrait&quot; (1979) to learn the real story.  Remember ... movie first!  Otherwise, you may find the on-screen version vaguely objectionable and even downright vulgar.",N/A

76504,"Pi is one of the better independent low-budget films I've seen in the last couple of years. It's a strange, twisted, subversive film, which takes as its thesis the idea that it's possible to know too much, to ask too many questions, for one's own good. A good example is the troubled protagonist of Pi, played to chilling perfection by Sean Gullette, who struggles with both the outside world and himself in his quest for the ultimate knowledge -- an equation which will tie together everything, from the beginnings of the universe to the chaotic ups and downs of the stock market. He is spied upon by unnamed big business interests, hoping to cash in on the latter idea; he is spied upon by Hasidic Jews who hope to cash in on the former idea; both sets of spies add the perfect element of paranoia to the film, and convince you that there is far more going on here than meets the eye, far more going on than is being talked about. The ideas put forth in later scenes bear this out -- boy, do they! -- but I wouldn't want to spoil that for you. The events of Pi, especially in the later scenes, are so surprising that any discussion of the plot would be totally unfair -- like telling someone who hasn't seen Citizen Kane what Rosebud is. So instead I'll confine myself to theme and character, which are sort of intertwined in this film. Gullette's character is a genius mathematician (as you might expect), a child prodigy of sorts who has always, we are told by his narration, courted such dangerous ideas and notions...and has paid the price for his arrogance more than once. He suffers from migranes -- really serious, agonizing ones which give him nosebleeds and vicious hallucinations, and which no painkillers seem able to stop or tame. (In fact the depictions of the migranes are amongst the film's best sequences; I watched it with a friend of mine who suffers from such headaches, and he said that these scenes were pretty close to what he experienced, at least in the feeling those scenes evoked.) It is during or just after the onset of these migranes that Gullette's character seems to receive his greatest revelations and insights -- and here the filmmakers use a technique of showing bright light as the literal image of these insights, a bit of symbolism that is almost, but not quite, clumsy and overdone. I believe it's by their sheer conviction that it works that the filmmakers are able to pull it off at all. In fact, it's through the use of this symbolism (light=knowledge) that Pi does some of its best work. It's used to illustrate the thesis I mentioned earlier, that it's possible to want to know too much for one's own good; Gullette's character relates how as a child, he stared too long into the sun, possibly triggering his migranes and his gift for numbers at the same time...which is why both seem intertwined in his perceptions. The use of light in the migrane sequences, and Gullette's subsequent gifts of insight, not only are symbolic but provide foreshadowing -- is he staring into the sun again? If so, what damage will he do this time? And as the plot slowly reveals where it is going, those questions become not only more difficult to answer, but more unsettling to even ask.Pi was shot in black and white, which I find entirely appropriate. The harsh images created by the cinematography are a perfect echo for the harsh story, spoken in a language of such harsh rhythms...like the song a puppet sings when it siezes the strings of its own puppeteer. It may take more than one viewing to get everything out of this film, because there's a lot packed into it...but the more you watch it, the more rewarding it is. I would heartily reccommend Pi to any lover of experimental film.",N/A

78050,"This two sided dvd contains two films from producer Dan Curtis (who was responsible for the famous gothic soap opera ""Dark Shadows""). The first is a very good adaptation of Bram Stoker's ""Dracula"". This novel seems to be an awkward one to film because almost every version you see changes the plot somewhat or takes liberties with the characters, especially Lucy and Mina. This version plays liberties with the characters and plot as well (the most faithful adaptation seems to be Francis Ford Coppolla's version (1992).  This is a handsome production made for television (in the U.S.), so you do have the awkward editing (for commercial breaks) and zoom shots. It has an excellent gothic feel to it and was filmed in beautiful houses and castles in Europe. Jack Palance plays a great Dracula - he is hulking and menacing and brings a sympathetic edge to the character. Also included is the original European theatrical trailer and brief interviews with Dan Curtis and Jack Palance.The opposite side of the dvd is ""The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyl and Mr. Hyde"" which also stars Palance. This production also has handsome production values but was filmed on videotape, so you feel like you are watching a PBS drama. Also, Palance's transformation to Mr. Hyde is somewhat humorous - his makeup job makes him look like the Joker from ""Batman"".  Acting is good all around, especially Denholm Elliot and Billie Whitelaw, who was introduced in this film.On the technical side, these films apparently have not been restored and there is some nicks and scratches (especially on ""Dracula"") but not enough to distract. Many of the outdoor scenes in ""Dracula"" are very dark. Some enhancement on these scenes would have been welcome.A recommended purchase, especially for ""Dracula"".",N/A

578274,"Think &quot;Good Will Hunting&quot; in the Bronx.The tried and true &quot;teacher-student relationship in which the teacher learns as much, if not more than the student&quot; resurfaces in this film, although Gus Van Sant gives it a new spin.  This time, the &quot;teacher&quot; is a misanthropic former wonder boy author, and the student is an inner city basketball player with an incredible talent for writing.Sean Connery and Rob Brown are very good as William Forrester and Jamal Wallace.  The role of Forrester allows Connery to go beyond his superhero pose, and Connery imbues the character with genuine human qualities.  He examines Forrester's wounds and eccentricities and lays them bare, but he also lets the character's arrogance shine through, exposing just enough to keep Forrester from being merely a crotchety old man.Of course, Forrester also happens to be Scottish, which isn't a huge stretch for Connery, and it allows him to plug his ancestral homeland, of course.  (An ancestral homeland he hasn't lived full-time in for over twenty years...But I digress...)Brown's intense, honest, understated performance is an excellent foil for Connery's occasional grandstanding.  It's not what Brown reveals, it's what he doesn't reveal that makes the performance noteworthy.  You can see the intelligence in Jamal's eyes, a difficult thing for any actor to convey.The problem with &quot;Finding Forrester&quot; is that the film spends so much time developing the two main characters, everything else pretty much goes by the wayside.  The plot is conventional and predictable, and the supporting cast is pretty much forgettable.  Will Hunting's scrappy, sometimes obnoxious group of drinking buddies (Ben Affleck, Casey Affleck, and Cole Hauser) were some of the most memorable minor characters in recent film because they were so well developed, but Jamal Wallace's friends and family are barely given enough screentime to have a conversation with him.Other characters fare just as badly.F. Murray Abraham essentially reprises his role as the disgruntled, talentless composer Salieri in &quot;Amadeus&quot;, but this time, he plays a disgruntled writer who takes out his anger and disappointment on his students.  Unfortunately, Abraham is never given the chance to reach the emotional complexity of Salieri, reducing his role to an angry, jealous old has-been.Anna Paquin, one of the finer young actresses of the day, is basically wasted in the thankless role of Jamal's potential love interest, Claire, the upper class white girl.  Paquin is given neither the screen time nor the material to develop Claire into a remotely interesting character.  The film ends before it can delve into &quot;West Side Story&quot; territory.&quot;Finding Forrester&quot; has every intention to be something other than conventional.  Unfortunately, so much time is spent building up the relationship between the two main characters, there isn't enough film left to do anything new, and the final message is nothing that we haven't heard before.",N/A

Mandy Patinkin is his usual fanatical self - which should work, considering he's playing an artist, and it does for most of the time, but he occasionally is just too &quot;Mandy.&quot;  Bernadette Peters is amazing, and her performance is much less affected than it is in Into The Woods, when she does some just-for-the-audience, out-of-character &quot;cutesy&quot; things that get on my nerves.  She plays Dot (Seurat's lover) perfectly, capturing her &quot;averageness&quot; and yet also her extraordinariness.I also liked James Lapines' script in this, even more than I did his script for Into The Woods.The show doesn't look like I imagined it while listening to the CD, although this is not necessarily a bad thing. The music is beautiful, performances are great, but it - well, it could have been even better - which is not to say that it is not amazing now.If you love the CD (anybody who loves musicals - especially ones by Stephen Sondheim - MUST buy it), then I recommend this movie.",N/A
533735,"Call it what you will--archetypal fable with a feminist twist, exquisitely choreographed martial arts movie, balletic spectacle balancing image, action, poetry and music--&quot;Crouching Tiger&quot; is a distinctive variation on familiar genres.  The words &quot;ballet,&quot; &quot;choreography,&quot; &quot;Eastern&quot; exotic myth don't quite do justice in describing the film.  For one, the action sequences are lightning swift--reminiscent of American silent comedies and more suggestive of music than of formal dance.  And certainly the tempo of this music and the pace of the film seem more Western than Eastern (as does the throbbing romantic cello of YoYo Ma).  Some will single out the three female leads in this rite-of-passage archetypal story as the film's most distinctive twist.  But even more novel is the way the form foregrounds allegory and approaches the theme of teaching and learning.  Film is a medium that is normally &quot;relentless&quot; in his  representation of the physical world, satisfying viewers' expectations of actions that are at least humanly plausible.  But by making his characters fly all over the frame, director Lee keeps reminding the spectator that if you try to respond this film as another action movie you will not only miss the point entirely but be thoroughly disappointed.  Sword play, flying, and fighting are metaphors for living, learning and loving.  All of the 5 principals in the story are learners--and all are failures to greater and lesser degrees.  In fact, the alleged villain, Jade Fox, is in some respects the most sympathetic of all the characters.  She had access to the most masterful swordsman of all but not to his teaching because of her status as a woman.  At one point sword play is compared with word play, or writing (through the picture-grams of Mandarese script).  Whether the instrument is a sword, a pen, or a brush, the viewer of this enchanting parable is finally enjoined to fashion a personal narrative that rejects pride and selfishness in favor of a life sufficiently disciplined to give itself over to love.","Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon VHS"
670334,"Finally! The original die-hard lethal weapon now has all of his adventures available on the digital format! I was wondering what took Warner Bros. so long. And the new digital transfer looks a whole lot better than the old VHS tapes I used to own! Looks like the WB did a bit of film clean-up as well- I don't see nearly as many scratches or other visual clutter in any of the movies like I did the VHS versions. If you're looking for the movies that made the police action genre what it is today, this is the series to take a gander at!There must've been a time when being in a `Dirty Harry' flick was an actor's ticket to modest-to-amazing stardom. Andy Robinson, the Scorpio Killer from the original DH, eventually found his way into the hearts of the Trekkie minions as the Cardassian tailor/spy Garak on `Deep Space Nine'. Along with a brief appearance by Suzanne Somers, Robert Urich (`Vega$') and David Soul (`Starsky &amp; Hutch') were featured in `Magnum Force'. `The Enforcer' saw future `Cagney &amp; Lacey' co-star &amp; 4-time Emmy winner Tyne Daly as yet another unfortunate partner of Detective Callahan. And Liam Neeson &amp; Jim Carrey had their moments in `The Dead Pool'.Like most, I consider the first `Dirty Harry' to be the best. There's just something about the way that it establishes the characters &amp; situations that Harry will have to face in the subsequent flicks. They could've made the fake blood more realistic-looking, however. Also included here: One half-hour documentary hosted by `Magnum Force' co-star Robert Urich, an original '71 behind-the-scenes doc, and theatrical trailer.`Magnum Force' has its moments, and I found the idea of our anti-hero actually defending the system he dislikes against rogue elements in the police department an interesting one. This one also features one noticeable flub: The scene where Harry's dismantling his apartment mail box. After the wimpy complainer starts walking back upstairs saying he doesn't want to get involved, you can see for an instant the shadow of one of the crew members on the wall above the stairway. Then there's the less-than-convincing scene where a nude, coked-up blonde drops several stories to her death. If there's one scene in the entire DH canon that could use some of that `Star Wars Special Edition'-style digital correction, that particular moment is it! Also included is a brief doc on the evolution of cop flicks leading up to the first two `DH' mo-pics, and an original theatrical trailer.I consider `The Enforcer' to be the weakest film of the bunch- the group of heavies looked kinda psycho, but didn't seem as scary or dangerous as previous or subsequent `DH' villains. The LAWS rocket climax was also pretty hokey. However, it has one of my fave moments in the entire series, where Harry asks Big Ed Mustapha, a Black Pantheresque militant, if he knows him from somewhere. This moment is something of an in-joke- Albert Popwell, the guy who portrayed Mustapha, also played the bank robber who felt lucky in `DH', the pimp in `Magnum Force', and Horace in the subsequent `Sudden Impact'. Strangely enough, he's absent from `The Dead Pool'. Also included: brief male full-frontal nudies (gasp!), a mini-doc, and a theatrical trailer.I thought `Sudden Impact' was pretty cool, even though most of it takes place a short distance away from San Francisco, rather than in the city proper. It introduced us to Harry's `old stand-by', the .44 Automag, which made for an impressive addition to our anti-hero's silhouette during the climactic `final fight' scene. And let's not forget the introduction of his most famous line, ""Go ahead... make my day."" Also added: common-law missus Sondra Locke, and Clint taking to the producer's &amp; director's seat for this one. `SI' also includes the most notable `blooper' in the series: while Harry's trying out the Automag at a makeshift target range in the woods, the aforementioned Horace drives up and opens the driver's side door to get out. As the door opens, you can clearly see the camera man in the driver-side window's reflection! One of cinema's most glaring oopsies. No docs are included here, just the obligatory trailer.Finally, there's the `Dead Pool', featuring the most bizarre car chase scene I've ever witnessed! And who could forget Harry's takin' out the last scumbag? Just when you thought he was dependent on the .44 Magnum revolver to protect himself, he surprises you with his improvisational skills! Also featured: another unfortunate cop partnered up with Callahan who's only one of two folks throughout the five flicks to survive the experience! As expected, a trailer is included.All in all, the Dirty Harry  collection box set is a pretty good presentation of the entire series. There's not an exhaustive array of extras, but if you're a big-time fan, I'm sure you'll consider yourself fortunate to have some new stuff to look at. Too bad WB still hasn't caught wind of putting their DVDs in plastic keep cases, rather than those flimsy cardboard snap sleeves that they still seem to be partial to.

The movie itself is restored to brilliant color and crisp clearness for the viewer's eye.  The extras were very interesting.  I very much enjoyed the Backstory(from the cable channel AMC).  It helps take the viewer behind the scenes a bit and see a little more than MM's undies.The deleted scenes made me laugh!!! To think what drew the line back in the 1950's as far as censors go!! These were so tame by today's standards.  They are still delightful scenes nonetheless.  They should've been put back onto the entirity of the film for the dvd.The movie itself is just elegant, as MM's character would say.  It's the story of Richard Sherman, played by comedic talent, Tom Ewell.  Marilyn plays &quot;the girl&quot; who gets Mr. Sherman's wild imagination going.

Whenever my wife and I would visit him he would offer to throw in his DVD of Hudson Hawk and we would beg off, claiming anything from work to do at home to severe stomach cramps. That's how badly we wanted to avoid this film.One rainy Tuesday afternoon, during my third month of unemployment this friend of mine and I went out for lunch and some DVD shopping. After finishing up we went back to his house and kicked back. He made his usual attempt to convince me to watch Hudson Hawk and for some reason known only to God and the demons that live in my subconscious I said yes. It was one of my most enjoyable movie experiences ever.It's almost impossible to put into words why I like this movie. It totally defies definition. It is a screwball comedy with a crime caper at it's center and a Secret Service Nun as it's femme fatale. The music is fun and fits well into the pace and scheme of the movie and the running cappucino gag is lame and contrived yet amazingly fun.It is really an experience that has to be enjoyed first hand.

536359,"When I first found out that one of my fave books was to become a film, I was a bit weary at first.  But I was curious to see just how it would turn out. Renee Zellweger puffed up approximately 25 pounds to play the british 30something.  I was very happily surprised by her performance as Bridge.  She brought great life to Bridge, and I thought that she did a great job. She carried the English accent off, and kept it for the entirety of the film..Bravo to Renee!Of course, the book is much better.. But this is one of the better &quot;book gone to film&quot; adaptations I've seen thus far.It's a good movie.  I thought that both Mark Darcy and Daniel Cleaver were convincingly brought to life by Colin Firth and Hugh Grant, respectively.  It's nice to see Grant not playing the &quot;nice guy&quot; for once.  He was hilarious as Daniel. If you're up for a romantic comedy, this is one of the best I've seen this year.

381514,"After the wooha over Moulin Rouge, I doubt one would ever expect that director Baz Lurhman (also known for the atrocious remake of Romeo and Juliet) to have anything to do with classical music.  Well this video from 1993 is proof, and excellent proof a that.  While there are some Lurhman-isms in there that are rather reminiscent of Moulin Rouge (ie: The big light-up red sign that says &quot;L'amour&quot;), this is pretty different ground for Lurhman.  He sets it in Post-WWII Paris, which is a wonderful move that portrays the bohemians in an incredibly different light (Rent, anyone?) that breathes new life into this Puccini classic.  Add an incredibly talented cast (and a pretty darn attractive Rodolfo) to boot, and this video easily earns 5 stars.  If you're looking to buy a video of La Boheme, I would reccomend this one, however if you have never seen the show live, you may want to get a video of a traditional production to see what it's original intention was, it makes for some great comparisons!","Puccini - La Boheme / Baz Luhrmann, The Australian Opera VHS"

As it is, Since You Went Away clocks in at something around 180 minutes, a famous producer's self-indulgence.  For the most part, it is wonderfully cast, my favorite role being Monty Woolley's retired colonel who adds a nice compensation to the rampant sentimentality.  Claudette Colbert is wonderful, but she can do absolutely nothing wrong in my mind, just as Robert Walker, as her daughter's love interest, can do nothing right.  That actor has always irritated me (his sleazy appearance and scratchy voice better served in a sinister role), so take my deeply subjective criticism with a grain of salt.

407244,"When I call this film &quot;standard action fare,&quot; I mean that it's a film where the action scenes and the effects are the main drawing cards.  It's not a memorable film, or one that I see myself viewing repeatedly, but it has enough strengths to be watchable.Other reviewers have found &quot;Mission: Impossible's&quot; plot confusing.  I found it merely routine--a by-the-numbers MacGuffin plot which serves mainly to fill screen time between the three big set-piece action scenes.  I simply didn't find myself caring about the characters or what was happening to them.It is the first two of those three set-pieces which make this film reasonably worthwhile viewing.  In the first, the majority of hero Ethan Hunt's IMF team is wiped out in Prague.  In the second, Hunt must penetrate a super-secure CIA computer lab to steal the aforementioned MacGuffin, a list of secret agents.  In both scenes, director Brian De Palma eschews exotic special effects in favor of some old-fashioned suspense, with very succesful results.  The third set-piece, a chase on board a train, strains plausibility at times and works less well.There is only one weak link in the cast.  Unfortunately, it is Tom Cruise, who is not a good choice as Ethan Hunt (since Cruise co-produced the film, he may be partly to blame for miscasting himself).  Cruise is fine in the action scenes, but he simply doesn't project the intelligence that his character demands.  He plays the role like it's a reprise of the grinning, live-on-the-edge pilot he played in &quot;Top Gun,&quot; and that doesn't work here.A talented supporting cast is largely wasted.  Vanessa Redgrave gives an interesting performance, and Ving Rhames leaves a strong impression in limited screen time.  Otherwise, talented performers like Jon Voight, Emanuelle Beart, Emilio Estevez and Kristin Scott Thomas are given very little to do.Finally, while I was never a big fan of the MI television series, I do think that resurrecting the Jim Phelps character from the series, only to have him turn villain, is going a bit too far.  I can readily understand why fans of the series would have trouble suspending their disbelief on that point.",Mission Impossible VHS

The acting is respectable enough, with all of the movies characters turning in solid performances. The production budget was low, given that the whole movie takes place in one location, but the director works with that limitation and creates a suspenseful movie.Unfortunately, as with other movies with storylines that occurred way before the film ever started, I spent most of the movie trying to relate to characters who seemed to have an ""in"" on what they were talking about that I was not privy to. Only so much can be accomplished by dialogue and flashbacks.. it seems as though most of what the characters struggled with happened years before the movie's storyline began.Nonetheless, there is some good dialogue and again, good performances by all around, but I must side with the other reviewer who said that anyone who felt this movie was ""great"" was probably just starved for a movie, ANY movie, with a gay theme.

He had just appeared in TALL STORY with Jane Fonda and had not yet been turned into  Norman Bates in Hitchcock's PSYCHO.I saw FRIENDLY PERSUASION about five times that year (1956 --admittance to pictures was a dime back then) and was absolutely smitten. Recently, I bought the DVD version of FRIENDLY PERSUASION and rewatched the film. I wondered if I would like it as much after all these years.  The answer is yes--only now I'm taking another look at Gary Cooper. At last I can understand better what mama saw in him.FRIENDLY PERSUASION is not an antiwar film. It was released long before the antiwar movement built against Vietnam. FRIENDLY PERSUASION could actually be construed as a pro-war film made in the glowing period of the fifties when the U.S. still basked in the victories of WWII. After all, when those bad Confederates threaten Mrs. Birdwell's pet goose, all hell breaks loose. And forget Jess Birdwell, we girls all developed crushes on Mattie's Methodist soldier boyfriend. Boy he looked great in that Blue Union uniform.During the Civil War, Friends (the Birdwells are Quaker) lived in southern Indiana at the crossroads where the two armed forces met. Interestingly, the Quakers were the heart of the Underground Railroad and instrumental, though indirectly, in bringing on the Civil War--which may or may not have been fought over slavery.As they sow, so shall they reap.  The Friends are not the victims of disciplined soldiers, they are the victims of hooligans and cutthroats--Southern Bushwackers.  A less sanguine and more violent tale of life where Union and Rebel lines were not clearly drawn and Jayhawkers and Bushwhackers constantly raided was told a year or two in Ang Lee's overlooked film RIDE WITH THE DEVIL. I recommend both of these films.And a little aside--Jessmyn West who wrote the novel FRIENDLY PERSUASION on which the film is based was Richard Nixon's cousin.

451579,"Based on the short story &quot;The Corpse Next Door&quot; by Cornell Woolrich (dating back to the '40s), Union City is a great example of what you can do with practically no money for a feature length film noir.A big reason for this is the director, Marcus Reichert.  Prior to (and after, as well) making this film, Mr. Reichert was known principally as an artist.  Sense of color is a particularly strong element in this film; in almost every interior set, we see striking primary colors predominating.  In Harlan (Dennis Lipscomb) and Lillian's (Debbie Harry) apartment, the living room is a deep disturbing red; another room's blue; a third, green.  In one scene, Lillian wears a bright yellow dress that almost makes your eyes water.The actors are all fine here.  Lipscomb and Harry are well matched as a dysfunctional couple.  Everett McGill turns in a solid performance as the hunky superintendent.  And Sam McMurray, CCH Pounder and Pat Benatar (I guess this was a queen of rock casting film!) are all right on target in their respective roles.This is a story of anxiety, obsession, murder, and guilt.  It's an edgy work well complemented by the moody colors of its sets.  The dialogue is a little stilted, but you can see that these slightly awkward phrases work well in the context of the jittery atmosphere.  The two principals both have something to be agitated about--murder and adultery.And with the price of this DVD, this is a real bargain.  Buy it before it goes out of print!",N/A
242159,"'The Lost Weekend' leaves a lot of fascinating questions unanswered - for instance, why wasn't Don 'Lester' Burnam fighting in the war?  There are some remarkable sequences here, in particular the opera scene nodding to Chaplin's 'The Gold Rush', or the Kafkaesque purse-snatching incident.  Throughout, Wilder emphasises the circle, the vicious circle, the noose, encircling even the narrative, ironising any 'cop out' move towards resolution, which, based on pure talk, has no solidity.  This is one that will go on and on, ending only in death or madness.Still, this is Wilder's most overrated film, as dated in dialogue, assumptions and wearisome drunk hero as a Eugene O'Neill play; while the visual 'daring' now looks frequently risible.  For a genuinely moving portrayal of a drunk, catch Melville's 'Deux Hommes Dans Manhatten'.",The Lost Weekend VHS
108847,"""National Lampoon's Animal House"" may have been one of the first comedies to evolve from the ""Saturday Night Live"" generation, but it could be argued that ""Caddyshack,"" directed by Harold Ramis-- and which features two SNL alumni, Chevy Chase and Bill Murray-- actually spawned the entire ""SNL genre,"" of films, because this is the one that seemed to lock in that formulaic irreverence toward all things, of which they are so indicative.  The story here revolves around a young man named Danny Noonan (Michael O'Keefe), a caddy at the upscale Bushwood Country Club, who is bucking for a caddy scholarship to get him into college.  Danny figures that the best shot he has at it is to volunteer for the assignment none of the other caddies want-- to caddy for the up-tight Judge Smails (Ted Knight), one of the executive directors of Bushwood, and ""kiss up"" a bit.  Smails responds by letting Danny mow his lawn and attend a christening ceremony for his new yacht.  But Danny is not one to be deterred, even when the good Judge tells him ""The world needs ditch diggers, too.""  He just goes on, keeping his eyes and his options open.And it isn't long before Danny gets involved with Ty Webb (Chase), an independently wealthy goof-ball with a Zen/Chaplin philosophy of life, whose father was one of Judge Smails' partners in Bushwood.  So Danny takes some advice from Ty while caddying for him; advice which just may ultimately have an effect on whether or not he gets his scholarship.  Or maybe not.  Words of wisdom like ""Be the Ball,"" and ""A donut with no hole is a danish,"" may not be what he needs to put him on the fast track to success.  But then again, you never know; it's that kind of movie.  And there's no getting around it, this is funny stuff.The humor in this movie runs the gamut from broad to subtle, with at least two sight gags thrown in that identify it as belonging to the genre it helped create.  At the time of it's theatrical release, in 1980, it was fairly on the cutting edge of comedy; by today's standards, though, it doesn't seem nearly as irreverent, especially given the digressive trend in the genre lately, which has spewed forth such fare as ""Freddy Got Fingered,"" and ""Road Trip.""  Then again, this one had Harold Ramis behind the camera, and Ramis has an acute sense of comedic timing, he knows what works, and he made the most of the basic screenplay (by Ramis, Brian Doyle-Murray and Douglas Kenney) and the terrific cast of comedians with which he had to work, all of whom fit so well into the pattern and fabric of this particular picture.Rarely does a comedy (or any film for that matter) have so many actors who fit their characters so perfectly as in this film, beginning with Chevy Chase, who embodies the slightly skewed and off-center Ty Webb so well it's almost frightening.  Webb is a guy who veritably floats through life in a perpetual Zen-like state of distraction, and it makes you realize that there probably really are characters like this walking around in the real world.  But if the existence of a Ty Webb type is only highly probable, there's no doubt whatsoever about the fact that there are guys like Al Czervik amongst us.Rodney Dangerfield plays Czervik, the obnoxious, fun-loving, high-rolling land developer with a specially made golf club and an eye on Bushwood.  In Czervik, Dangerfield creates a character who is outrageous, droll, lacks any taste whatsoever, and is entirely hilarious.  It is, without question, the best character and performance of Dangerfield's cinematic career, and -- like Chase-- it's almost scary the way he fits into the character so naturally and completely.The real heart of this movie, however, is Bill Murray, who turns in what just may be the definitive Murray performance with his character, Carl Spackler, the Assistant Greenskeeper at Bushwood.  Murray brings Carl, the socially and intellectually challenged man-with-a-plan, to life with subtle nuance and a flare of comedic genius.  A lot of what he did in this film was improvised, including much of his two most memorable and hilarious scenes, one in which he's describing his encounter with the Dalai Lama, and the other being his soliloquy of the ""Cinderella Boy"" on the course at Atlanta.  This is truly inspired, funny stuff, and it proves what can be done without resorting to banal vulgarity or crudeness (not that this film is entirely devoid of it, but at least it's tempered here somewhat-- not so overt and in-your-face like you'll often find in some of the more recent offerings of the genre).  And there's a harmless shiftiness about Carl, who is about as deep as a pan pizza, and Murray plays it all beautifully.O'Keefe gives a solid performance, as well, but he's basically the straight man here, the set-up guy for one funny situation after another.  And he does it quite nicely.Also giving memorable performances are Ted Knight, as the rigid, conservative Judge, and Brian Doyle-Murray as Lou Loomis, who oversees the caddies at Bushwood.The supporting cast includes Sarah Holcomb (Maggie), Scott Colomby (Tony), Cindy Morgan (Lacey Underall), Dan Resin (Dr. Beeper), Henry Wilcoxon (The Bishop), Albert Salmi (Mr. Noonan), John F. Barmon Jr. (Spaulding Smails) and Lois Kibbee (Mrs. Smails).  With this film, Ramis and company honed the formula for comedy that incorporated pop culture and contemporary sensibilities into it like never before.  And ""Caddyshack"" is an example of it in it's purest form; you'll have to look long and hard to find anything out of this same mold today that can come close to the prototype.  It's one of those movies that gets even better with age-- and funnier, too.  It's the magic of the movies.",N/A

I looked over at him and asked how he liked it.  &quot;I hate it,&quot; he responded.  &quot;Well,&quot; I said, &quot;I guess I could watch it myself tomorrow since I want to see them break out into all of those Cole Porter and Irving Berlin numbers during the midst of this Shakespearean comedy.&quot; All of a sudden I noticed the remote had crept closer to his chest and he said, &quot;Let's give it another five minutes.&quot;  I knew I had him and ,sure enough, he was laughing like mad when the burly Spainard broke into &quot;I Get A Kick Out Of You.&quot;  The tale itself is slight about 4 men who want to get together with 4 women but for this vow they've made to immerse themselves in asceticism for 3 years.  That vow is easily broken.  The play is also updated to the 1930-1940s WWII Europe, which of course goes better with the music.  I think a partial debt is owed here to Woody Allen's &quot;Everyone Says I Love You,&quot; which first broke the musical into non-musical material with non-musical stars.

162305,"Aaron Sorkin adapted his own play in &quot;A Few Good Men&quot; and Rob Reiner deserves great credit for his superb pacing and getting the most out of his talented cast.  The conflict presented is that which has been widely debated since the Nuremberg Trials, the question of responsibility on the part of military personnel following orders under a chain of command.Initially it appears that Navy lawyer Tom Cruise is no more than an all-purpose goof off with a penchant for shirking responsibility and a passion for softball.  This is what Demi Moore, another Navy lawyer summoned to work with Cruise on the case which is the major element of the story, believes when initially meeting him.  She ultimately learns that Cruise, whose deceased father was a former U.S. attorney-general, is fearful of failing to successfully follow in is father's awesome footsteps.The film's principal clash is between Cruise, who is defending a private and a lance corporal in the ferocious hazing death of a fellow Marine in the process of carrying out a &quot;code red,&quot; military shorthand for forbidden disciplining, and the gung-ho Marine commander of the Guantanamo Bay base, Jack Nicholson.  The pivotal scene is when Cruise deliberates whether to risk his own career by asking Nicholson in cross-examination whether he violated code by ordering a code red against the deceased Marine.  He manages to successfully antagonize Nicholson to the point where he explodes, admitting ordering the code red, and denouncing Cruise and others like him who he believes meddle in the path of brave, career military personnel like himself who seek to save lives in the only way they know how.  Nicholson after his emphatic declaration is read his rights and led away to ultimately face his own court martial trial.

71894,"Based on an equally disturbing book , American Psycho is a spectacular movie if you have the stomach for it . It tells the story of yuppie Patrick Bateman who , along with his friends , spends the biggest part of the day worrying about what they wear , eat and listen . Bateman has another side in his private live though. He is a cold-blooded murderer . He takes his victim's lives with the worst possible way. Analyzing the meaning behind Whitney Houston's music or Huey Lewis &amp; And The News's lyrics is obviously not enough to define himself. Not that he kills people  in order to achieve that . It's more like an effort from a man who has no inner-side ( as he himself confesses in front of the mirror ) to feel alive in a way . The murder scenes are absolutely abominable and can almost cause damage to a sensitive person's soul . Haron doesn't hesitate to add black humour touches to a movie as shockingly gory as this one ( Bateman washes...his gloves after that meeting with his collegue in the bathroom ) . Yet it's Bale's exceptional perfomance as the sick psycho which makes this as great and breath-taking as it is.

566119,"For those of you who have seen this and are looking for a message, I can say that the brutal facts of life, that is to say, an animal existence, will out.  Whether we are talking about sexual desire and sexual release, or about reproduction--especially that--it is the fundamental animal drives that control our lives and dictate our actions.This movie offers nothing beyond that, and it shouldn't.  It is perfect as it is.  There is no phony sentimentality to entice us to delusion, or any sort of Hollywood ending.  There is no redemption here.  There is no spirituality.  There is only desire and fulfillment; desire and frustration; desire and the end of desire which comes with...  The movie doesn't say.I don't know if this makes my top ten of the nineties--I have seen a lot of movies--but it makes my most memorable.  I will not forget this stark performance by Katrin Cartlidge, who plays Claire Dolan.  She does not have the charisma of a great actress, and the range of what is required here is limited, but within that range she is stunning.  A good part of the credit surely goes to director Lodge Kerrigan, who emphasizes the tight, washed out lines of desperation on her face, along with her intense sexual desire and the stark, rapacious environment of the urban jungle in which she plies her trade.  This is a movie that might well be viewed following Pretty Woman (1990).  I wonder how many people who allowed themselves to identify with Julia Roberts as a whore, would like to identify with the high class prostitute of this film.  Could they even watch it?I was mesmerized by the sharp cuts and the film verit&eacute; editing, the effective use of line and shadow, sound and silence, the clean, focused camera work.  Our modern cities in all their indifference--the hard concrete and steel, the harsh lighting and intrusive sounds--are captured brilliantly.  The script, cut lean and without comment, surprises us by turns, and keeps us on the edge of our seat throughout.  The sex scenes are raw, intense and numerous.  This is not a film for the kiddies.  And that is an understatement.Vincent D'Onofrio, who is an actor of suburb balance, plays the cabby who loves women, especially perhaps those in great need of his love, and he plays his part with subtlety and control.  Colm Meaney plays the psychopathic pimp, a brutal man without conscience who uses force when necessary and a kind of cheap charm when it isn't.  He has the type of the animal trainer, who plies the whip and the carrot, which he uses on women.  Note well how Kerrigan has ironically emphasized this despicable man's ability to reproduce himself, making him the father of four children.If I could sum up the life that Claire Dolan leads, I would say she lives among the wolves with a burden...her sexuality.  She has a flat affect, strangely bereft of normal human expression.  She is a kind of woman seldom seen on the silver scene, presented without an ounce of sentimentality.  She feels life most strongly through sexuality, and only smiles at the result of sexual behavior, children.  There is something profound in the realization that she is only really freed from her almost maniacal desire when she is with child.  Meaney's character says he has known her since she was twelve and she has always been and always will be a whore.  She will die a whore, he says.  If true--and again, the movie lets us decide for ourselves--the question is, how did she become that way?  The implication is that she was led or forced into prostitution at twelve.  That is why she cannot feel about sex the way others feel, and that is why she finds it so difficult to feel affection for others.  Hers has been an animal existence.  She is always on her guard, and she shies away from a world that seems always about to hurt her brutally.--Dennis Littrell, author of ""Cut to the Chaise Lounge or I Can't Believe I Swallowed the Remote!""",N/A
267891,"Criterion's DVD of NOTORIOUS is a nice addition to my Hitchcock collection.  I thought I'd seen this film, but actually had not.  The first third of the film is a bit slow, although the acting is superb (Ingrid Bergman is excellent here).  Once Bergman's character shacks up with her former German lover, the film gets very exciting.  The Unica key scene is thrilling; the wine cellar scene is full of suspense (Will the party run out of wine?? Will Cary Grant and Bergman be discovered??  Excellent suspense!) Hitchcock is, by and far, &quot;the master of suspense.&quot;The disk has Criterion's usual attention to detail.  I love the package art.  The extras are great, including alternate endings illustrated by script excerpts.  Also, memos from Selznick and the Ratings Board are interesting.  My one complaint is about a bonus section on the fate of the Unica key.  A narrator describes how, years later, Ingrid Bergman presented Hitch with the key at his AFI salute.  It sounds like a wonderfully emotional scene. I realize that buying the rights may have been prohibitive.  I only wish it could have been included.",N/A
407562,"Ingmar Bergman's best films give the viewer the feeling of participating in a rite.  Its rhythms are less those of conventional narrative, than of theatre or a religious procession, say.  As with rites, the appeal is not to the viewer's intellect; their effect is both sensual and spiritual, troubling precisely because we can't put our finger on that appeal.Of course, this requires a kind of faith, and is open to charges of manipulation, precisely the theme of 'The Magician', a splendid slice of unnerving Grand Guignol horror, where a rather academic argument between the Enlightenment values of sceince, reason and empiricism confront those of superstition, magic and the inexplicable.  These latter values might be called medieval, pre-Renaissance, and we are reminded that the modern theatre developed in this period from the Church, from rites and passion plays.  this is the kind of effect 'The Magician' has, visually and tonally.The argument is not between the doctor and the mesmerist, but between the film's surface narrative (which, as an argument, promotes the predominance of reason) and the film's form (which destroys every attempt at argument).  Everything within the film that seems to derive from supernatural forces can all be ascribed, more or less, to rational causes, for example psychological weakness; even if it is this very weakness, that border between what we know and what we can't know, in which the mesmerist exists.  Although we might say 'Ah, it's only a delusion', the very fact that these self-generated delusions can convincingly take the place of safe, everyday reality, can become that reality, suggests the limits of rationality, without any recourse to the supernatural.The shams of actors, con-men, misanthropes pretending to be mute, women pretending to be men might all be illusions which, once exposed, can restore the status quo; but once the idea has been suggested that a boundary can be crossed, that an illusion can be real, than a system based on those boundaries is undermined.In a film where actors pretend to be what they're not, whose narrative proceeds like theatre and climaxes with a theatrical spectacle, Bergman's technique can be called a charade - e.g. the haunting trip through an eerie forest, the fog streaming in the sunlight like a magical gateway; the terrifying attack on the doctor in a surrealist attic, are all an illusion to give us a sensation, but they also undeniably reveal a world for us that lives with us and which we never acknowledge.  As ever with Bergman, it is only with acting, deception and illusion, not ational argument and empirical evidence, that we can even begin to approach the truth.",The Magician VHS

93088,"I first saw this film in a movie theater and later saw it a couple of times on video.  &quot;Goodfellas&quot; is not only one of Martin Scorsese's very best films but also one of the most realistic and convincing crime movies in film history.Based on a true story, &quot;Goodfellas&quot; chronicles the rise and fall of Irish-Italian American gangster Henry Hill(Ray Liotta).  Hill goes from slick mob dandy to drug-addicted paranoid and eventually winds up in the Federal witness protection program.Martin Scorsese's &quot;Goodfellas&quot; is one of the greatest crime movies in film history.  Scorsese's masterpiece is a successful blend of the satire and crime genres.  The ultimate result is a realistic portrayal of organized crime in the United States.  Scorsese's key players are perfect: Ray Liotta, Robert DeNiro, Joe Pesci, Lorraine Bracco, and Paul Sorvino.  Robert DeNiro is the last of the great screen actors and is both menacing and convincing as murderer-thief Jimmy Conway.  Although DeNiro is a strong presence, most of the story's emphasis is placed on Ray Liotta's Henry Hill.  The story is told through Liotta's eyes and he gives the best performance of his career.  Joe Pesci is great as the almost psychotic Tommy DeVito.  In a very tense moment with Liotta at a mobster get-together, Pesci utters a great and unforgettable line that is vaguely reminiscent of DeNiro's now-famous &quot;You talking to me?&quot; one from Scorsese's &quot;Taxi Driver.&quot;  Future superstar Samuel L. Jackson briefly appears as a robber.  Scorsese and Nicholas Pileggi should also be praised for an outstanding screenplay.  The film has a great dialogue that is both creative and realistic.  Scorsese's &quot;Goodfellas&quot; also possesses a powerful sense of realism that is sorely lacking in even Francis Ford Coppola's &quot;Godfather&quot; masterpieces.

540000,"A.I. is the wonderful sylistic hybrid of two of Hollywood's greatest directors: Stanley Kubrick and Steven Spielberg. For the past twenty years, Kubrick had struggled to bring this story to the big screen. After his death in 1999, Spielberg assumed the mantle and has made this his tribute to his longtime friend and colleague. Set in the distant future, our story details the journey of an android boy's (Haley Joel Osment) search for love and acceptance. Osment, star of The Sixth Sense, is perfectly cast as the young robot child David. He is the first robot programmed to love human beings. Jude Law turns in a dizzying performance as Gigolo Joe, a robot prostitute who accompanies and aids David on his journey. Frances O'Connor is also quite convincingly heartfelt as Monica, the &quot;mother&quot; whose love David yearns to receive.The first act of the film is pure Spielberg as we see David coexist and ultimately exiled from his surrogate family. Spielberg's influence is clearly visible in the scenes between David and Monica. (Think E.T. and Elliott.)The late Stanley Kubrick's hand print is all over the film's second act. In the first scene, Law's Gigolo Joe is front and center as we witness him on a &quot;job&quot;. Although his female client is a bit reluctant and nervous, his tenderness and rationale overcome her inhibitions. There is another scene where Joe and David are captured and taken to a Flesh Fair. Here, rabid crowds cheer on as robots, or mechas as they're called, are destroyed on stage for entertainment. Spielberg successfully captures Kubrick's soul during these scenes.The film not only documents the clash between man/machine, but the clash between Spielberg's and Kubrick's ideologies is also evident. The running theme with Spielberg is that, though flawed, humans are basically decent. Kubrick, as shown in his past films: 2001, Clockwork Orange and Full Metal Jacket, forces the viewer to deal with the darker side of humanity. Human beings are not inherently evil, but are more than capable of acting without regard for their fellow man.The final act is one that will cause audiences to either love or hate this film. Spielberg borrows from his own work in Close Encounters of the Third Kind as well as the final act of DePalma's Mission to Mars. To me, it seemed as though Spielberg ended the film this way because he couldn't allow Kubrick's vision to ultimately win. It's as if he tried Kubrick's &quot;acid&quot; and had a bad trip. Evidently, Spielberg's inner-child wouldn't allow audiences to go home completely dismayed.If not for the final act of this movie, I would have given this movie 5 stars.

26386,This film owes more than a little to Hitchcock Donen is almost bordering on copy right infringement rights here. But that's a good thing! Since Hitchcock nearly invented and perfected the romantic thriller. The Film stars Grant and Hepburn in some of their most public persona roles not for a second do you believe that they are portraying characters but you believe that Grant and Hepburn THEMSELVES are in danger. That makes this film a very trippy and arresting experience. The scenes where Hepburn thinks that Grant's character is truly evil and she decides to flee is both hilarious and heart pounding at the same time. The film has an almost reved up feeling to it. In some scenes the shadows are so stark they act as if they are another character in the film and so does the eye popping color in the more splashy scenes and Criterion's transfer of the film is perfect! I love this film for just being pure fluff and escapism. It's a roller coaster ride of heart pounding images and witty dialogue and pretty faces and it's marvelous!,N/A

669555,"David Chase's series &quot;The Sopranos&quot; is a fascinating portrayal of the complex allegiances and contrasting values of a mobster struggling to cope with the challenges of his two families- his biological family, and his crime family.The series is powerfully entertaining, and also explores the dark side of the human psyche as seen through the eyes of Tony Soprano and the other richly developed characters in the show.The second season, in my opinion is clearly the best one thus far because of the new developments in the storyline and all the tensions coming to the forefront.  This is particularly true of Tony's conflictual relationship with his mother, his struggle to keep Uncle Junior under his thumb (while maintaining his &quot;stripes&quot; as the de facto boss); in addition to new challenges with his biological family.Also, these 13 episodes are well-written, acted and skillfully directed.  The sessions with Dr. Melfi (his psychiatrist) are seamlessly woven into the other plot developments, as well as the rich dream and fantasy sequences that delve into Tony's thought process, as well as his anxieties, both conscious and unconscious.  David Chase has put together a real gem.  If you can't catch the re-broadcast on HBO on Sundays at 8, or you just want the high quality of DVD, pick this one up.  It's a real thrill-ride...and it will definitely make you think, and see things from a different perspective.",N/A

182284,"Life of Brain is a little over the top, but for a Python movie it is along ways bellow the top. Terry Jones directs (with terry Gilliam as visual desinger) this movie about the alternate Jesus. Brain was born in the stable next to Jesus's (as explained in a hilarious oppening scence invlolving the three wise men) and goes on to become an accidental Messiah. Brain is played by Grahm, and the other Pythons make continual, skit like appearances. Life of Brian is more of a movie than any of the other Monty Python escapades, but it still doesn't flow as well as a normal movie.If I wanted to get a freind into Monty Python, this is what I'd show them, most of the humor is something everyone will appreciate, and everyone I know (besdes me) who likes Monty Python says that this is their favorite of the movies (I like Holy grail best).On the DVD: It has a theatrical trailer (only one, and it is basicilly just movie clips, nothing new added). It has a making of documentery (it gives nice, detailed opinions of the Pythons, by the Pythons as well as an informative look at the way Life of brian was made). It has 5 deleated scences. These are poor quality, but not overlly so. These scences all have a two of the Pythons talking (on an optional audio track). The final, special feature is four British Radio adds involving the Python's mothers telling you to go see the movie.The chapters are well organized and placed. There are two derictor cuts, one with Eric Idle (my personal favorite), Terry Jones, and terry Gilliam. The other has John Cleese and Micheal Palin (Grahm died in 1989 from cancer). These cuts are quite nice, pleanty of info about the movie, and some of the personal feeling about the movie in general or specific scences.",N/A

I had thought that perhaps my memory had been kind to the film, but it was just as spectacular as I recalled, and more surprisingly, I found the commentary track on this DVD to be excellent.  Most DVD commentaries are pretty throw-away (save those by Steven Soberbergh), but this one was very enjoyable and informative.  What was a throw-away was the historical documentary included.  I would have appreciated another documentary on the making of the film itself.",N/A
557493,"Ken Burns Jazz does a decent job of introducing jazz, but suffers from many defects that keep it from being great.  This is an interesting way to learn about the early history of jazz, in particular in the social context of how the music was evolving.  Being a middle-class white guy from the West Coast, I really didn't have much exposure to many of the social movements that went on during the first half of the century.  From that point of view it's an enligtening show, but it's neither a great jazz documentary, nor a great social history documentary.Jazz also does a reasonable job of exposing the various schools and movements within Jazz.  If you want to know where Bebop fit in the grand scheme of things, and who it's main practioners were, it's a decent way to find that out.However, too much of this is focused on the early history of Jazz.  As many have noted, Mr. Burns jams everything from 1960 onwards into one episode, after devoting a episode to nearly every 5 year period before that.  It's a little too much of Wynton Marsalis' viewpoint that the only real jazz was the early stuff.Mr. Burns spends far too much time with the Great Man theory as well.  Louis Armstrong comes into just about every episode, even when he was no longer a major innovative force in the music.  Duke Ellington is similarly constantly mentioned.  Other musicians drift in and out of the picture, usually to much lesser degrees.  While hanging the series off of Louis Armstrong's life is an interesting way to frame things, it's really rather limiting.  Many great and influential musicians never get mentioned at all.  Miles Davis is almost glossed over, Nina Simone never shows up at all.  Can't remember hearing Cannonball Adderly's name anywhere.  And if they came of age after 1970, they're lucky to have a their name mentioned at all.All in all, if you know nothing about Jazz and you'd like to learn a rough history, this is a reasonable introduction.  However, if you want a detailed discussion of the history of Jazz, look elsewhere.",N/A

In fact, this is ONLY Tim Burton movie I like. I have recently seen Sleepy Hollow and hated it with a burning passion.

I'd never seen these episodes, having started watching during season 3, and I was curious about the history between Carrie and Big, as well as having a thirst for a new fix of this great HBO original program.I was surprised that the very first show (pilot) was pretty weak, but that is the ONLY episode I wasn't crazy about. Getting to know Carrie, Miranda, Charlotte, and Samantha from the start is great fun. As the first season goes on, we really get to know the four distinct and seperate characters with their common problem, finding a normal man in the Big Apple.I really find this show very entertaining, and am very happy with my two ""Sex..."" sets. If you've never seen the show, or started late like I did, here's a chance to catch up on what you've missed. I'm sorry I didn't tape season three, but I'm wising up and taping all the shows now, new and repeat, when aired.For the single lady who is searching for her prince, or for the married lady like me who has been lucky enough to find hers, at some point you'll relate to this show, or at the very least, you'll be entertained. Even if you have a different agenda, you'll STILL enjoy hanging out with these four friends.For the men who are ""Out There,"" although I can't speak about how they might view the series, I can assume that the average man most probably won't enjoy this as much as women do.  Men are often unympathetic characters on the show.  Yes, that's an understatement!I think an open minded man might watch this to get a handle of what the opposite sex might be thinking or going through. Let's face facts though, most WON'T want to get in touch with their ""feminine side."" That said, the married woman will probably enjoy this as a solo viewing pleasure.  However, I think that women who are single, will love the show, and feel like...""Hey, it's not me, it's YOU"" toward their relationships, and about the whole single and dating experience in general.Either way, every time you pop it in the VCR, it's a girls night out in the safety of your own home.

430009,"Er, it's not *that* good. At the time, the critics went a bit mad and proclaimed this as the greatest action movie of all time, but it isn't. Essentially, John Woo is a superb director of action sequences, but pretty lousy otherwise, and 'Face / Off' suffers from having lots of 'otherwise'. There are only two or three proper, 'Hard-Boiled'-style action setpieces, and for the rest of the film there's an awful lot of talking. Both Cage and Travolta are fine, although the latter seems to be starting to bulge out of his suit,. but the plot is ludicrous, the talky bits go on too long and don't add a great deal to the film, and there's the sense that, even today, Woo is being held back by Hollywood convention. I mean, the last half of 'Hard Boiled' was essentially a long action sequence with no plot, and it worked; but here, there's lots and lots of plot but surprisingly little action.

This movie is SO FAR below the standards of film cinema that have emerged in recent years that I would be [angry] if I had to watch it free on TV!If you're under 30, please do not watch these older films unless to satisfy your curiosity.

This is not played on a grand scale but on a human and intimate scale.  There is also no motive besides outright greed.  The French location shooting is gorgeous and adds much to the film's impact.

Needless to say, that was the reason I saw it and I was reasonably surprised at what a fantastic movie it was. In all honesty the nudity is a good device to reel you in but never reaches a level that I would call gratuitous.All parties involved do a great job here including Hugh Grant in the first role I've actually liked him in.  Sam Neill as the libertinous artist Norman Lindsay is the perfect foil to Grant's sexually frustrated Rev. Anthony Campion.  Seeing these to go up against eachother is hilarious in a dry sort of way.  It doesn't take much to push Campion's buttons as Lindsay discovers and you can scarcely imagine what he does with this newfound knowledge.The story is kind of dry and slow-paced and at times deeply introspective in that way that art films can get.  But these things aside, it was surprisingly good film.  Rent it for the Elle Macpherson factor (or Portia de Rossi whichever your preference) enjoy it for its irreverence.",N/A
582647,"'Thirteen Days' is one well-done political thriller. It is based on the events concerning the Cuban Missile Crisis of 1962, when the U.S. discovered that the Soviet Union was using nearby Cuba as a missile base. Threats ensued, tensions escalated, and even war seemed like a horrific possibility.The film stars Steven Culp as Bobby Kennedy, Bruce Greenwood as a relatively convincing John F. Kennedy, and Kevin Costner as a right-hand man to the President, a sort of advisor, to keep focus and make sure things didn't tumble out of control. Costner does a good job here. He plays stern men very well, and so is perfectly suited for the role. Some have quibbled that his Bostonian accent is bad, but I judge the performance on more merits than if the voice is dead-on or not. That leads us to Bruce Greenwood as JFK. His looks and mannerisms come across quite superbly as the young President which we have pictured in our minds. The *voice* is a somewhat off, but why quibble? He's an actor, not necessarily an impressionist.The film is directed well - very starkly, with well-placed camera angles and good cuts between scenes. The other performances in the picture are good, especially the representation of Adlai Stevenson. His famous scene in the United Nations is re-created with stirring pride, and does the tension of the real event justice. Other scenes are handled well: the running of the blockade, the communications between JFK and Kruschev, and the meetings between Kennedy and his advisors.'Thirteen Days' is meant to be a tight, engrossing thriller, and it succeeds quite admirably in that endeavor. The performances and the direction are above par. Its historical accuracy is, I'm sure, flawed in certain areas (most &quot;based on real life&quot; movies are), but it excels in bringing forth the tension that must have existed at the time. If there is one slight drawback to the film, it is that the Kennedys are portrayed as nearly perfect men. There is a great deal of nostalgia for the &quot;Camelot&quot; period of time, and JFK most certainly was a decent man, but here he and his brother are illustrated to be brave, noble, better and above all the rest. It is one of the few times the movie smacks of being somewhat slanted. But that is a forgivable view. This is a movie about one of our darkest hours, and the strong men who shone brightly through it.We all know that everything turned out ok, that there was no war, that we thankfully live in a free society which feels a little safer due in part to the events dramatized in 'Thirteen Days'. It would be good to read a well-respected history book to get the cold facts on the matter, but if you're looking for a good exposition of the raw emotions involved, then be sure to watch this intense film.",N/A

366143,"Last night I recaptured a treasured childhood memory when I watched &quot;13 Ghosts&quot; in it's new DVD incarnation. I was pleased to find that the film was entirely restored, including not only trailers but theatrical prologues and epilogues that I haven't seen since I was 6 years old. The &quot;Illusion-O&quot; process worked fully as well as it did in 1960 and overall, I was not merely pleased, but actually blissful at being able to so fully re-create that important (and influential) childhood experience.One small criticism, there is only ONE Ghost Viewer packaged with the DVD, and also, the RED filter is a teensy bit too dark, although the blue filter worked perfectly.Looking at the film again from an adult vantage point I was struck by how much the film has to do with &quot;secrets&quot;. From Buck's Birthday wish right through to Elaine's cryptic line &quot;Ask me no questions, I'll tell you no lies&quot;, the whole plot of the film seems to be an exploration of secrecy/privacy within the family dynamic. Buck's Birthday Party presents the visual motif of the circle (in this case the family circle) which is threatened by squares and angles (in the form of the book, and the squarish ghost viewers.) The family circle expands to include Ben, a grave mistake, during the Ouija scene, and sets the stage for the frightening scene which follows. Buck's keeping of his secret is accompanied by his exclusion from the circle (of the Seance) and his subsequent endangerment.All three circle scenes have &quot;group communication&quot; as their theme. All the &quot;square&quot; scenes (dealing with the book, the four-poster bed, the secret panel in the staircase and, of course, the glasses) are about priviliged/private, secret communication. Plato Zorba, a man well used to keeping secrets, has been living in Los Angeles since the time of Buck's birth. Buck and Plato are stongly connected,and have a similar attitude toward &quot;spirits&quot; and, of course, secrets. It is Buck's need to differentiate himself from his family, and to trade on his secrets which leads him to confide in the one person unworthy of such confidence.Wonderful movie for kids, wonderful movie for adults, wonderful movie - period!",N/A
523103,"Russell Crowe is the reason this film won an academy award. His performance as Maximus blew me away; it was if I had never seen a movie actor before. He took a role which could have been one-or-two-dimensional and from the moment we meet him, he encompasses everything Maximus is supposed to be: a leader, a fighter, a farmer, a man who loves his family, a man of honor,  and a spiritual man. It's so hard to actually put your finger on it, but his facial expressions and the way he delivers such lines as, &quot;what we do in life echoes in eternity&quot; and especially the speech where he states his name, &quot;loyal servant to the true emporer, Marcus Aurelis, father to a murdered son, husband to a murdered wife,&quot; -- I defy anyone that hears Russell deliver that speech to not feel something. The music swells up, the crowd is cheering, the gladiators yell &quot;Maximus&quot;. A definite favorite movie moment for me. I do think Gladiator an average story and it is; but Russell, and Russell alone, takes a film with some great filmmaking and lifts it up to a point where we feel we've seen a great film.  I really believe this would have been a summer blockbuster ignored by the Academy at the end of the year if it hadn't been for Russell Crowe. I do have a lot of respect for Tom Hanks and Ed Harris, but I must say I cheered when Russell took home the prize.

86751,"This should serve as a pre-warning to Stephen King fans: stay away!!!  Yes, indeed, Stanley Kubrick did take liberties with King's 1977 novel.  But is this a crime?  Kubrick's entire approach to filmmaking is based on taking a well-know piece of literature and twisting it to meet his own artistic vision.  And what a vision it is!  While there is a genuine sense of dread permeating throughout the film, it actually plays more successfully as a sly satire of the horror genre than as the real deal.  Jack Nicholson's performance, for example, is a comedic one; there is no way one could get through the classic bar scene without cracking a smile.  Nicholson winks at the audience from the very beginning; his dialogue during early scenes is tinted with a benign sarcasm.  Once he begins to lose it, he loses it ten-fold!  Jack has never been as charismatically psycho as he is here.As with most of Kubrick's films, every character (from Shelley Duvall's spacey housewife to the hilariously WASP-y hotel manager) comes off as a one-dimensional parody of their real-life counterpart.  Why?  Because Kubrick's primary objective is to satirize human behavior, to reveal all of the absurdities and contradictions so commonplace in &quot;civilized&quot; society (check out &quot;Dr. Strangelove&quot;, &quot;A Clockwork Orange&quot; and &quot;Full Metal Jacket&quot;).  And it all takes place within one of the finest set designs ever used in a Hollywood film.  Kurick's approach to horror is take-it-or-leave-it, but there's no denying this is a milestone picture and a work of art.  If there ever was a testament to the enormous talents of both Stanley Kubrick and Jack Nicholson, this it is.",N/A

Then you've probably turned to sci-fi to live out your dystopian (or utopian) fantasies. So in the never-ending quest for the right drug, take the blue pill. Blue Thunder, that is. Blue Thunder explores all possible options for expostion. Such a revisionist history usually attempts to redefine science fiction in film-specific terms, opting variously for epistemologically based or image-based criteria instead of the source-based or narrative-based assumptions that have so far shaped most discussions of SF film. Not so with Ol' Blue Thunder. Central to the genius of this film is the reconsideration of the question of whether cinemato graphic aspects of film production could themselves mark film as science fictional or provide in themselves phenomena worthy of consideration by the SF community--the spectacle of production technology deserving and rewarding our attention just as surely as do narratives about the impact of technology. And the SF community would have a lot better things to talk about than cinemato graphic aspects if they did the wild thing more often, instead of drooling over Captain Kirk's tush in Star Trek! The fleeting colaboration of brilliant thespian (Rob Schneider) and brilliant director (John Badham), combined with the building blocks of life known as craft service (oh yeah, and let's not forget the writers!) made one tour de force without the tour or the force, so I guess this film is just made of &quot;de&quot; (get it?) So what are you doing still reading this review? Go out and rent it!",Blue Thunder
61129,"This film, like many of Cronenberg's, was way ahead its time.  I think the other reviews give it plenty of credit, however I wish to warn any potential buyers that there are more &quot;complete&quot; versions of this film in circulation.  Like many of Cronenberg's celluloid, it fell under the knife.  This is the re-released &quot;uncut&quot; version, but there is almost 30 minutes of additional footage out there, much of which has been seen on cable TV and foreign bootlegs.  There are scenes which take the storyline even farther into madness/TV un-reality, which enhance the perceived confusion immensely.  This film really deserves Criterion treatment.",N/A

All the casts are superb including Patricia Arquette and Ellen degeneres. There is enough plot and twist to make this standard murder mystery plot fresh. And funny script make this even more enjoyable.The plot basically is about the death of advertising executive (Don Johnson). His brother is the sole beneficiary of the insurance policy. So the police (Ellen de Generes) is suspicious. To say more will spoil the fun.The DVD is OK. Both WS and FS versions included. The color is bright and clear. The 5.1 sound only active during wonderful music score by John Ottman. Overall this is a highy recommended DVD.",N/A
533041,"This movie is surprisingly charming, given the fact that critics pilloried it when it first came out. All I can say is that Mel Gibson still has what it takes to be a leading man in a romantic comedy.The movie certainly opens promisingly enough with a hilarious sneak preview into the childhood of the main character, Nick, a top advertising agency executive that Mel Gibson plays with great aplomb. Nick is a divorced, male chauvinist who thinks that he is God's gift to women. Unfortunately, as so many men of this type are, he is dead wrong. He is just a man's man who thinks that he is a ladies' man.He begins to get his comeuppance when the coveted job of Creative Director, to which he is expecting to be promoted, is offered to someone outside the agency, another advertising whiz named Darcie, affectingly played by Helen Hunt. She gets the job, rather than he, so that the agency might be better able to  tap into the women's market. She is now his new boss, and Nick is not happy.After their first meeting, the disgruntled Nick goes home and drinks himself into a stupor. Look for the wonderful dance routine done in best Fred Astaire style. It is a charming salute to an all time great. While in his inebriated state, however, Nick has a shocking accident (pun intended) that enables him to be able to read women's minds.This ability causes him some distress, as he is amazed to find out what women really think of him, and it is not always flattering. It also enables him to please women as never before, as he is able to read their innermost thoughts and anticipate their needs. It even helps him repair his relationship with his fifteen year old daughter who is undergoing teenage angst.He uses this ability, however, to trump Darcie, unbeknownst to her, as he has every intention of getting the job he coveted. What he does not anticipate is falling in love with her. This certainly puts a kink into his plans. The question is whether love will triumph. Watch the movie and find out.The contrivance of being able to read women's minds creates some very funny scenes and interesting situations. It also allows Nick's character to grow as a person and become more three dimensional. There is a strong supporting cast that includes Delta Burke, Marisa Tomei, and an unbilled cameo by by Bette Midler. This is an engaging film that, oddly enough, is sure to delight both men and women, and Mel Gibson, with his easy going charm, is definitely what women want.",N/A
558171,"A Technicolor fever dream of a movie, GARDEN OF ALLAH is a guilty pleasure par excellence.  Any dramatic tension that depends on the burning passion of Boyer and Dietrich is doomed from the start; two more self-absorbed performers never graced the camera.  But, in parallel universes of suffering, they pout and posture and preen so gracefully, all is quickly forgiven.  Joseph Schildkraut and Tilly Losch bring a touch of Mittle Europe to the Exotic East, and David O. Selznick's over-the-top physical production is as hyperbolic as the story and stars.  Quentin Crisp said that in his youth, most movies were made for melancholy middle-aged women.  This picture is what he meant.  Open a box of chocolates, and wallow.",N/A
506969,"It's illustrative of Marlene Dietrich's clout that nearly all English speakers pronounce her name more or less correctly.  (OK, so my own father did not: he made it rhyme with &quot;Darlene,&quot; but I suspect he was in the minority.)  As a former German teacher myself, this fact has some significance to me.  I used to struggle to teach my students that a final &quot;e&quot; in German was nearly always pronounced as a &quot;schwa&quot; sound (an unemphasized &quot;uh&quot;).  Somehow though, even people who knew how to pronounce &quot;danke,&quot; &quot;bitte,&quot; &quot;Rilke&quot; and even &quot;Goethe&quot; would still seem to remain puzzled by an orthography that is actually more consistent than our own.When you're a true star, though, you get to insist on people pronouncing your name right.  In that Marlene had a (shapely) leg up on such other prominent German performers as Elke Sommer, Lotte Lenya or Ute Lemper.  You also get to pull stunts like agreeing to allow someone to do a documentary on your life and work (that &quot;someone&quot; being Maximilian Schell) and then utterly refusing to let him put you on camera.  Or for that matter, to let his crew film ANYTHING in your apartment.Well, if life hands you a lemon, you make lemonade, right?  And so Maximilian Schell wound up making a documentary less about Marlene Dietrich than about the near impossibility of making a documentary with a cantakerously uncooperative subject.Schell ends up reconstructing Dietrich's Paris digs in the studio.  Her taped interviews are played over scenes from her films, from performance clips and from shots from various newsreels.  The effect is haunting.  The viewer shares Schell's exasperation with his temperamental subject.  Is it possible to ever truly fathom this woman's character? It's more than a matter of a former beauty refusing to be photographed: she refuses to let herself be truly known at all.  Any penetrating question or observation is dismissed as &quot;Quatsch&quot; (nonsense).  Her life, her films, her status as a cultural icon--none of that interests her anymore, or so she claims.  Ostensibly, the reclusive screen legend is more accessible than a Garbo, say, who would never even allow herself to be interviewed.  But in her steadfast refusal to reveal herself in any significant way, she remains as remote and impenetrable as Garbo ever was.  Maybe more so.I watched this film recently, right after viewing the documentary &quot;Nico Icon&quot;--about another enigmatic German-born singer-actress.  It made for a fascinating double bill.  Nico, of course, was of a different, more jaded era, but she was once labeled &quot;another cooler Dietrich for another cooler generation.&quot; Of course, the Andy Warhol &quot;Superstar&quot; (always meant as an ironic appellation anyway) never actually achieved the level of fame that her countrywoman did in her time.  The younger woman, in fact, totally lacked the drive and ambition that Dietrich possessed in spades.  Ironic then, that both ended up (pretty much at the same time in history) as recluses in Paris.  Of course the Hollywood star lived there in splendor, while the former &quot;Superstar,&quot;  now a junkie, lived in absolute squalor.  Both women withdrew into the shadows, while living in the City of Lights.  The difference, of course, is that Dietrich could afford to pay her electric bill.  Perhaps the one image that best sums up the difference between these two iconic German women--and, to some extent, the generations that they came to represent--is the stock footage of bombed out Berlin that is used in both films.  For Dietrich it represents the world she was fortunate enough to be able to leave behind: for Nico, it was the world in which she grew up. (Both &quot;Marlene&quot; and &quot;Nico Icon&quot; are available on DVD and are highly recommended.)",N/A

475214,"This movie appeared without much fanfare between two of Soderbergh's more commercial ventures--after &quot;Out of Sight&quot; but before &quot;Erin Brockovich&quot;.  Certainly, this is a less commercial movie, but it does have some of the classic Soderbergh touches.The first is a dedicated, perhaps even obsessed, protagonist in the form of Wilson, a parolee played by Terence Stamp (who has been long missing from the screen--check out the flashbacks of Wilson as a young man, which are recycled from an earier Stamp film) who is determined to find out the circumstances under which his daughter Jenny died.The color palette of this film resembles that of the Mexican scenes in &quot;Traffic&quot;.  Other interesting Soderbergh mannerisms include jittery jump cuts and showing Wilson's thoughts of what he wishes he could do--but doesn't.This isn't a particularly suspenseful movie--we know where we are going long before we get there--but it is filled with interesting characters (including Luis Guzman from &quot;Traffic&quot; playing a friend of Jenny's) and the pace never lulls.For Soderbergh fans, this is a must-see.

The Dolby 5.1 is excellent and so is the picture transfer. Director Roger Christian provided a commentary track. I would suggest you listen to it even if you hate the movie. It is really insightful. The plot about earth that is enslaved by Alien race. The Alien general is played by John Travolta with heavy make up. Barry Pepper (the sniper from Saving Private Ryan) is the hero.

The movie has no beginning and no end, only a middle. I also think that half of the acting isn't acting at all, but real people. The characters are totally droll, however I think that was the point. But since these characters are so out there why should a viewer care. It plays more like a HBO America Undercover special, that doesn't make sense.Then there is the boy with the bunny ears, a black dwarf, a boy who looks like a troll and about 14 million stray cats.I mean there are parts of the movie where I found myself laughing at loud because it was so silly.

8397,"I was expecting the worse afterrenting this movie one night. I had seen how quick this movie exitted the movie theatre's. I had seen how quickly it came and went with barely a flick of the public's eye.  I hadn't talked to anyone who had even saw it. I only knew it from previews that left me shaking my head, 'Oh Brad please' and rolling my eyes. ANd I knew it also from hearing the latenight talk shows make fun of it. I can completely understand how and why this happened. No-one wants to be preached to by a hollywood moviestar or worse have to endure a movie to serve a moviestar's ego or sense of righteousness.  However times change and so did I. I learned about the horrors of Tibet through another source from an actual Tibetan Monk who had been imprisoned and tortured and still spoke of love with out boundaries. His message was extremely powerful in this form. That was two or three years ago. Since then, when I chose to awake to the horrors of the world, I have kept Tibet ever in my thoughts and prayers.  I try to spread the word but I know how difficult it is in this sleeping world of America. For I was part of it. We'd all rather not know and just watch TV or go to the movies. In this light it is clear why pretty much no one wanted to see this movie, even with Brad Pitt in it. The movies are what we escape with.So now I watched it and I now then expected to be dissapointed in a completely different way. I thought it was going to be too hollywood and not portray the beauty of Tibet, the wisdom, and especially the tragedy that is bieng forced up on them.  But this movie delivers. It is a personal story focusing on Brad Pitt's Henry who is pretty much a selfish jerk. He journeys and falls into some very bad luck and is abandoned by everyone and everything adn eventually he learns to abandon the jerk that he is.  He develops a wonderful friendship with the Dalai Lama and slowly begins to open his mind to TIbet and it's heart.  The movie is beautiful both in scenery and movement. It moves pretty slow but keeps a nice storytelling pace. This movie is great for anybody whether you know about Tibet or not. It's a nice story. The imagery and the music make it that much betterI think this was Brad Pitt's best chance to win an Oscar. I guess he's just too good looking to win one. Like it matters anyway. The oscars hasn't represented the Best of Anything in over a quarter of a Century. It sold out a long time ago as evident by the beautiful Iranian gem of a few years ago The Color of Paradise not even getting a best foriegn film nomination.  I guess you have to be from Italy or France or Japan or Brazil to even get consideration. Bunch of SNobs don't even get me started. But this is a great movie. A movie that makes you say why doesn't Hollywood make more of these Movies that focus on Good Stories instead of glitter. But I guess my answer is found in the success that this Movie had. Or better yet what success it didn't. I'm talking ofcourse about the Holy AMerican Dollar.",N/A
79759,"This is a beautiful film, reminiscent of something by David Lean, and in some ways superior to the book, which more closely concentrated on Kip, the sapper and Hana, the nurse, whereas the film likes the story of Katherine, the spoiled, and Count Alm&aacute;sy, the bitter, better.  I think the film is right for a popular audience.  But essentially they are similar works done in different genres.Although The English Patient won a number of Academy Awards, including best picture and best direction by Anthony Minghella, the public was not entirely pleased.  There are two problems: One, the central love story is not appealing to many people because Katherine Clifton (Kristin Scott Thomas) is committing adultery and Count Alm&aacute;sy (Ralph Fiennes) is not a sympathetic character.  Two, the structure of the movie with its flashbacks and temporal ambiguities is very demanding on the audience.  Because of this some people found the movie boring.  However, the structure is very well thought out and works well to convey the sense of time during war in which events sometimes happen so quickly that time flies, and at other times the slow pace of days is unbearable.  Additionally the Academy Award winning cinematography by John Seale makes vibrant the expanse and feel of the vast desert setting and the sense of timelessness that the desert can evoke.  And of course the cast was excellent, right down to the supporting players including Naveen Andrews as Kip and J&uuml;rgen Prochnow, whom you may recall as the captain of the Unterseeboot in Das Boot (1981), as Major Muller, and especially Juliette Binoche who won the Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress as Hana, the nurse.There is some irony here, because had Minghella followed the story and structure of the novel by Michael Ondaatje more closely, the movie would have focused on Hana, and Binoche would have had to win the award for best actress; and Kristin Scott Thomas's part, for which she was nominated, but did not win, for Best Actress, would have been a supporting role.  Also note that in the novel there is a similar disjointedness in the time structure.  Ondaatje worked as though painting in layers, going back to a point and elaborating on it, coming back to a &quot;present&quot; and then going back again and again, and then finally moving forward to the end.  Minghella tried to convey a sense of that structure because it was an important part of the novel, a statement about the subjective nature of our experience of time.By the way, the book disappoints with its phony PC notions about how Kip and some others might have reacted to the atomic bombing of the Japanese cities, the author imagining that Kip would be offended that the bomb was dropped on &quot;brown people&quot; and not on Europeans; but in truth, few at the time really comprehended or cared about anything other than ending the horror of the worst war in human history.  Director Minghella, wisely, I believe, does not bring Kip's notions to the screen.  I was more horrified by the booby trap bombs left behind by the Axis soldiers that Kip had to disarm because they were left specifically to murder people whereas the atomic bombs had at least one clear and laudable purpose: to end the war and to end it as quickly as possible with a minimum of lost life.  It should be added that the firebombing by both sides, in particular the firebombing of Dresden by the Allies, was worse in terms of damage and lives lost than the atomic bombings of the Japanese cities.  It is cliche, but a profoundly true one, to consider once again that war really is hell.",N/A

109199,"In 1926 acclaimed English mystery writer Agatha Christie disappeared after her car was found in the countryside. She later reappeared at the Harrogate Spa claiming &quot;amnesia&quot; and unable to explain what had taken place. The screenplay by Kathleen Tynan and Arthur Hopcraft constructs a solution to Christie's real life mystery by suggesting that she followed her husband's mistress to Harrogate Spa. What is intriguing about this idea is the way the treatment has Christie use the skills she presumably used to create her novels, to investigate the potentially lethal electrical apparatus used at the Spa as slimming devices. However outweighing the thriller elements of the film is the romantic approach by director Michael Apted, represented by the casting of Vanessa Redgrave as Christie, Dustin Hoffman as an American journalist following her, the lighting by Vittorio Storaro and the production design by Shirley Russell. Redgrave encapsulates the shy genius Christie who hides in her clothes and her partnership with the dandy played by Hoffman is both the coming together of two oddballs, and the excitement of seeing two great actors complement each other. Hoffman is as aware that Redgrave is Christie though she uses a false name as much as Redgrave is as aware of his awareness. Apted uses this double act of voyeurism of Hoffman spying on Redgrave and Redgrave's Christie spying on her husband's mistress as a demonstration of the public's fascination with celebrity, even celebrity as unwilling as Christie is - at a launch of her book at the film's opening, Christie can barely speak to say thank you for the attention. Redgrave and Hoffman have a delicious moment when she stoops to kiss him in profile, and Redgrave's tear as she half sings They Didn't Believe Me is memorable. Also good are Timothy Dalton as Mr Christie - a role drenched in irony given Dalton's then real life relationship with Redgrave - and Australian actress Helen Morse, radiant as someone who befriends Redgrave at the Spa. As Pauline Kael points out in the review in her collection, When the Lights Go Down, there can be no substance to the mystery theory since it is known Christie was found and her days accounted for - therefore she cannot be seen to harm anyone and particularly not herself. The plot then is about a death scheme that is foiled.  And though we know Christie will divorce the husband she returns to, giving him what he wanted all along, and we know that she will not rush to Hoffman because his role is fictional, we question Redgrave's final gift to Hoffman because there is no way it can be used other than as a personal rememberance. Perhaps, as Kael, suggested it would make more sense if Hoffman's role were more the yellow journalist or envious writer, but then that would be a different movie. As it is, it appears merely the parting gesture of people that we don't want to see part.",N/A

The writing in this series was very inconsistent.  The Hammer DRACULA series is much better overall.Anyway, the movie seems more interested in a look at society's evils and less on the Frankenstein legend.  All the Baron does is transplant a brain from one man to another.  The man who created life and transplanted souls is little more than a mad doctor in this film.  And having Frankenstein rape the woman was totally out of character for the Baron, thrown in by the producer.  None of the actors wanted it used.True it has all the famous Hammer expertise.

38156,"In the opening scenes of 'Magnolia' PT Anderson goes a great length in setting up the premise that the implausible is certainly not impossible.  However, an hour into the movie, the unusual opening scenes can be conveniently forgotten.  The movie settles into a comfortable zone, relating stories of a group of individuals who are going through a certain crisis in their lives.There is the male-power guru who has the chance to watch his estranged father dying.  There is the grown-up child genius that is searching for the meaning of his mundane life after the spotlight of television gameshow fades away.  Meanwhile, another child genius is struggling with the same spotlight that he hardly desires.  All these stories and more are told masterfully.  Anderson will show you that he has what it takes to convey such vivid emotions across the screen.  Throw in a fabulous soundtrack by Aimee Mann (although words have it that Anderson was inspired by Mann's songs and not the other way round), and there is the drama waiting to pluck the Oscars.Or so you thought.  Anderson shifts into the high gear and the denounement will blow you away.  Then you remember why he painstakingly set up the opening scenes.  As an audience you don't really know what to make of it, to like it or to turn away in disgust.The truth is, 'Magnolia' is as much a drama as it is a showpiece.  It exudes arrogance and for once you remember as an average moviegoer you are at the mercy of the director.  He is the storyteller and like it or not, he has the power over you.

However, I refrain from giving it a full five stars because as brilliant as it was, it just was not quite as brilliant as everyone said it was. Gwyneth Paltrow was lovely and charming, but she was not quite as luminous as everyone gushed (in my opinion). The story of Shakespeare fighting writer's block and looking for a muse and falling in love with Viola de Lesseps was an inspired storyline. The cast, from Geoffrey Rush to Rupert Everett as Shakespeare's rival Christopher Marlowe to Judi Dench as Queen Elizabeth, is excellent all around. Joseph Fiennes is the truly luminous performer here, showing Shakespeare as a man of passion and inspiration but all too human nevertheless. The love story is actually feasible and beautiful and tragically illuminates the way toward Shakespeare completing his tragedy Romeo and Juliet. The film is resoundingly beautiful.",Shakespeare in Love VHS

Nevertheless, the DVD (without any extras except a fascinating trailer) is superior.  The grainy film stock and sound are excellent.  The movie is a timely today as it was in 1983.

570221,"Everyone was so down on Arnold's first movie (End of days) since recovering from kidney problems. He was accused of rushing in and taking any part, regardless of the quality of the script. Well, I disagreed with the critics on &quot;End of Days&quot;; I thought the story was pretty good and it was a nice change to see him in the role of a vulnerable, fragile, average guy. The 6th Day puts Arnold back into a familiar character that we, the fans, are used to. He's back as the larger than life action hero! Performing death defying, super human feats and kicking everyone's butt along the way. This is the role that all Arnold fans (and critics for that matter) seem to be most comfortable seeing him in. That being said, I don't think this is a bad movie; on the contrary, I really liked this flick! When it come to this genre of movies, Arnold has a strangle hold on the industry. One quick note, If you look carefully, they use Arnold's stunt double allot in this movie...I guess he's not a 100% physically. Like most of my reviews, I won't describe the plot of the movie because you either read it before, or through one form or another, have been told the plot. What I will say about the movie is, the story has a great premise and touches on a current moral issue...Cloning, and the probably inevitable misuse of the technology. The movie has a nice flow to it; from beginning to end the story stays strong and keeps you hungry for the finality (that has a little twist to it). But what makes this a movie to buy, and not just rent, is the quality of the DVD. Along with Gladiator, The 6th day is a sign of the next generation of DVD's that are on the horizon; unbelievable audio and video that had little to no motion artifacts from the transfer! This movie is a dream for Home Theater enthusiasts!",N/A
329309,"Despite the setting and the idea of the mysterious zone where your wishes come true and to which natural-born guides, Stalkers, can take people, the film has little to do with science fiction. It is a metaphoric tale about people frightened by their own choice of destiny; the style is as un-Russian as a film can get. Understatement is the word; you will not see overblown emotion or people making dramatic statements every step of their way. It is amazing that, ideologically, the director got away with the pictures of barbed wire and dereliction which looked distinctly like home to viewers in the Soviet Union. It is unbelievable that censors went so easy on a film with so many hidden meanings and without a clear-cut politically correct message. The film benefits from Kaydanovsky's very strong acting, it does not feel very long at all and flows beautifully. The tiny role of Stalker's wife, played by Alisa Freindlikh, a prominent Russian actress, is one of her best.Unfortunately, VHS version does not do justice to supremely soft, understated and subtle picture and cameraman's work. This is best revealed in cinema viewing. Nevertheless, definitely top-notch work. You will be glad you bought this film.",Stalker VHS
553658,"I saw &quot;Sisters&quot; because I am somewhat of a Brian DePalma fan.  &quot;Sisters&quot; is one of DePalma's most superior films.A reporter(Jennifer Salt) sees an actress commit a murder.  No one believes Salt, so she enlists the aid of a detective(Charles Durning) and sets out to uncover the truth.Brian DePalma made &quot;Sisters&quot; when he still knew how to make great movies.  &quot;Sisters&quot; is DePalma'a third best film after &quot;Carrie&quot; and &quot;Dressed To Kill.&quot;  A pre-&quot;Superman&quot; Margot Kidder perhaps gives her very best performance as the tormented Danielle; I'm sorry that Kidder never became a superstar.  Jennifer Salt is also great as the nosy reporter; I'm also sorry that Salt largely disappeared from the entertainment industry after making this movie.  DePalma cleverly borrows elements from two of Alfred Hitchcock's greatest movies: &quot;Psycho&quot; and &quot;Rear Window.&quot;  DePalma almost literally grabs the viewers out of the audience and pulls them into the queasy and forbidding world of the characters in the story.  The film is very suspenseful and shocking, and we develop a great concern for the characters.  DePalma's use of the split-screen technique is absolutely brilliant.  The inconclusive ending is frustrating yet intelligent.  I'm sad that the director of this unforgettable thriller would go on to make such inferior movies as &quot;Scarface&quot; and &quot;Raising Cain.&quot;I plan to see this movie again.  &quot;Sisters&quot; is for all Brian DePalma fans and anyone who loves suspense thrillers.

314747,"This movie is a fine ensemble performance.  There is the afther, Burt Lancaster, who is reaching the end of a full life.  His children and their families are joining him for a birthday bash that will be the talk of the town.  Yet this isn't about a birthday party, it is about connections.Lancasters children are all enmeshed in thier own lives and families.  But it is the children who are closest to Lancaster's charecter.  He tells them stories of Vikings and valhalla and the kids take not and remember.  Lancaster expresses a final wish for what to do with his body after he dies.  He doesn't tell his children, maybe sensing their opposition, so instead he tells the grandchildren - maybe not expecting them to do it but convey his wish to their parents.There is comedy, despair, anger and sadness throughout the film.  It doesn't dwell on one particular emotional level, rather it touches them and moves on, as we all do in life.The conclusion is a remarkable combination of humor, suspense, sadness and togetherness.  It is worth the whole movie to just watch the last fifteen minutes.I recommend this to anyone with families and to those who want to watch a well crafted film production.

212889,"I've never been a fan of Stephen King's books or movies adapted from his stories, but I have to admit I really enjoyed this film.  Almost 20 years after it was released, it's still very powerful, and the reasons are multifold.I'm a big Christopher Walken fan, and in this film, he hits every emotion available right on the nose--sympathy for his character, fear of human contact (and the lack of it), disability, weariness... he does it all splendidly, and straighter than most of his other film roles.If that wasn't enough, check out Martin Sheen (now ironically playing the president in &quot;The West Wing&quot;) thoroughly enjoying himself as a complete lunatic presidential candidate.The pace of the film is it's greatest strength; it never sacrifices believeability for garishness, and ends on a fitting note, remaining as true to the book as is possible for a movie.  It's suspenseful, entertaining, and most of all, fresh.  Many movies since then have used elements of it, and for good reason; it's solid filmmaking.",N/A
16330,"This movie quickly disappeared from the theaters, which is really too bad, because it's an excellent film.  Those reviewers who disliked it because it didn't have enough &quot;Stephen King&quot; have missed the point.  Good horror doesn't always depend on lots of supernatural gore.  Sometimes the most frightening things are the terrible possibilities we find within ourselves -- if we dare to look.  Much of this film consists of psychological games, but that doesn't make it any less terrifying.  If you have ever wondered how ordinary good citizens (like yourself???) could have ended up serving the Nazi genocide machine, then this movie is a chillingly real answer.  An excellent study in how seemingly moral people can be manipulated by fear and seduced by power.What starts out as an honor student's curiousity about a dark chapter in history soon degenerates into cruelty and manipulation on both sides.  The student begins by blackmailing an old Nazi war criminal into telling him all about the concentration camps -- and that means EVERYTHING -- or else he will turn him over to the authorities.  The old Nazi, fearing arrest, complies.  But the boy soon goes beyond curiousity, as he begins to enjoy having absolute power over another human being.  At this point, the student is the sadist, and I actually found myself feeling sorry for the old man.  But wait -- the Nazi still has a few tricks up his sleeve, and the tables are soon turned...  To tell you more would be a spoiler.  Just remember: when you dine with the devil, the spoon is never long enough.",N/A

The plot, pretty basic: De Niro is Nick: he steals expensive jewels and collectibles for a living and is faced with a very large coup, his last one, where he's joined by Edward Norton (Jack). It's SO predictable that Jack is going to try to set Nick up, that I don't mind saying it here!

544611,"THE OTHERS is an intelligent, effective ghost story/psychological thriller by the Spanish director best know for his outstanding Spanish film Abre Los Ojos (&quot;Open Your Eyes&quot; in English. . .currently being remade by American director Cameron Crowe). The two films share a number of thematic elements (the nature of perceptions, for example), and in fact &quot;Open Your Eyes&quot; would have been an excellent title for this film as well. The film itself it a blend of the classic literary ghost story ala Henry James and the modern thriller ala THE USUAL SUSPECTS and, to an even greater degree, THE SIXTH SENSE. Notably, it's a film almost completely free of sex, violence, and special effects (I'll let you decide if that's a good thing or a bad thing). Kidman's performance is very good, though she does chew the scenery a bit in places.

But whatever you choose to call it, this is one of the sleekest and slickest caper movies you're ever likely to run across, and what you're really going to end up calling it is pure Entertainment (yes, with a capital ""E"").  Incomparable escapist fare, impeccably crafted and delivered by director Steven Soderbergh and a dynamite cast, ""Ocean's Eleven"" is a joy ride that gives you a chance to root for the bad guys and feel wickedly good while you're doing it.  Because, after all, what's so bad about a bunch of regular guys ripping off a bazillionaire casino owner, who in the first place isn't such a great guy himself?  Remember, the key word here is ""escapist""; don't worry about moralizing while you're watching this one, because a movie like this is made to let you to live vicariously for a couple of hours, so just sit back, relax and go with the flow.  Just remember:  These are professionals; don't try this at home.When Danny Ocean (George Clooney) is released from prison, he doesn't waste any time.  Taking a rather indirect route after leaving the place he's called home for some time, he winds up in Las Vegas where he quite simply plans to rob three casinos owned by one Harry Benedict (Andy Garcia), an extremely meticulous businessman, who is also-- if his reputation serves correctly-- an extremely ruthless individual.  He's not a guy you want to mess with.  So why does Ocean want to pick on Benedict, who has the means and the muscle to crush him like a bug with a mere nod of his head?  Suffice to say it has something to do with a personal agenda, as well as the possibility of a paycheck worth around $160 million, which-- even after splitting with the ten other guys he's about to recruit for the job-- will land him a share that won't be too bad for a day's work.  And, of course, there's the challenge; Danny Ocean and his buddies are about to attempt the impossible.  What he is proposing is something that has never before been accomplished, a gamble with nearly insurmountable odds; but, hey, this is Vegas-- and that's what it's all about.To be sure, Soderbergh had the deck stacked in his favor right out of the chute with the cast he assembled for this film; but like any self-respecting odds-makers in Vegas will tell you, nothing is a sure thing.  Soderbergh still had to mix all the ingredients just right-- cast, story, photography, music, action, humor-- to make it cook.  Well, he may not get the Oscar for Best Director for it, but if there's a Golden Chef's Hat Award, he's a shoo-in for preparing this feast.  This is a veritable smorgasbord for the senses; it's easy on the eyes, it'll give you some laughs and make you feel good, it's easy to digest and in the end is a totally satisfying experience.  There may not be anything ground breaking about this movie, and certainly nothing especially new, but Soderbergh presents it with nuance and finesse, as well as that special artistic touch of his that is so definitive of his work.  Neither was a haystack anything new in Monet's day when he chose it as a subject for one of his paintings, and the rest is history.  It's how the artist renders the subject on canvas that's important, and it is in this that Soderbergh excels.As Danny Ocean, George Clooney demonstrates that he has the charm of Grant, the magnetism of a young Brando and the down-home agreeableness of Jimmy Stewart.  With his personality alone, he defines Ocean in no uncertain terms.  From the opening frame you know exactly who this guy is.  Still, there are a few surprises along the way that keeps him interesting.  Mostly though, he's just enjoyable to watch as he puts his plan into action, and it's easy to believe he's who he is and doing what he's doing.  And that's part of the charm of this movie and, moreover, goes to show you what a good performance Clooney actually gives here.  Unlikely as the story may be, he sells it in such a way that it works; and as the customer, you not only buy it, but walk away with the extended warranty and go home satisfied.  And that's a good bit of acting in anyone's book.And though Clooney is clearly the star of the show, Brad Pitt checks in as Ocean's friend, Rusty Ryan, and emerges on fairly equal footing with his illustrious co-star.  Like Clooney, Pitt turns on the charm and serves up Rusty as a credible enough figure, with a performance that may not be much of a stretch for him, but one that is certainly engaging.  The character is lacking somewhat in depth and definition, but Pitt manages to give you a clear idea of who Rusty is without too much by way of development.  Call it a fast-food characterization; nevertheless, Pitt does a good job, and for all intents and purposes, he makes the character work.The single question mark in the casting may be with Julia Roberts as Tess, Ocean's estranged wife.  She looks good and gives a solid, if not memorable performance, but she seems to miss the mark slightly in capturing the true essence of the character, which may have been better served by someone like Catherine Zeta-Jones or even Rene Russo.  But that's a purely subjective observation, and I'm sure there are those who will argue that Roberts was perfect for the role.  In either case, Tess is an integral part of the story, and Roberts neither enhances nor distracts from the overall proceedings; most importantly, she does make Tess believable.  And in the end, with a terrific supporting cast (too lengthy to mention here), ""Ocean's Eleven"" is one you don't want to miss.",N/A

Aside from wanting 'em to shut up (not to mention telling them where they can put those lightsabers), you probably asked yourself, 'Just what does that mean, anyway?', inwardly ashamed that you didn't understand the reference. Well, thanks to the release of SUPERMAN II on DVD, your guilt trip over this little quandary has reached its final destination.Terence Stamp, who played the part of the no-confidence-voted Chancellor Valorum in SW-I, made his first mark on celluloid pop culture as General Zod, leader of a trio of Kryptonian criminals in 'Supe II'. He really chews up the scenery with his alternating moments of diabolical calm interspersed with occasional bouts of arrogant assuredness. His part was a redeeming quality in a movie that, while not quite living up to the original, held its own as a fun camp classic in the super-hero genre of cinema.Unfortunately, when it comes to adding extras, Warner Bros. decided to not look beyond the DVD release of the first 'Man of Steel' movie. While that film got the full treatment, this sequel only registered a trailer for an extra. No restored/deleted scenes (including The seen-on-TV 'Lois teaches Superman to bake a souffle' scene), documentaries, or anything else for that matter.

463461,"The problem with A SIMPLE PLAN is that its title is unfortunately accurate.  It's a little too simple, this plan.  The plot, not to mention the characterizations, are so frequently devoid of explanation that this morality play ends up drawing no conclusions we can apply to our own lives.Chief among the problems is the plot's genesis. How a plane could crash within reasonable proximity of Washington DC and not be discovered by authorities is frankly unbelievable.  Did all the radar systems on the ground suddenly go dead?  Did the NATSB suddenly forget how to triangulate location based upon the last known data received from the plane? Did they look for a day or so and then give up, just because there was some snow on the ground?  Some might call this nitpicking.  But it's absolutely crucial to the plot.  The story depends upon a money-loaded plane not being discovered by authorities, but we're never given adequate understanding of how that came to be.  It's as if the writers simply posited the existence of such an event and we're supposed to accept it without question.It also misses the boat on characterization.  Fonda's character is wholly unsympathetic.  She makes such a radical emotional change we have little reason to care for her.  Indeed, this is kind of the problem of all the characters.  There is no motivation for their criminal acts, other than that circumstances made it possible for them to commit them.  The film would've been more compelling  if there had been some nobler motivation for their acts.  Self-preservation may be the kind of goal that leads to an examination of the darker side of the human psyche, but it is, again, too &quot;simple&quot; a tale.  To be sure, this is the tale the filmmakers obviously wanted to tell.  But it would've been far more interesting had the film been a cautionary tale about the dangers of noble ends being justified by evil means.What the film lacks in plot and theme, it makes up for in acting.  Paxton is at perhaps his most powerful in this film.  Long relegated to supporting roles, or starring in fairly emotionally uncomplicated ones, we see here a depth that has been too long hidden.

484160,"A lot of people aren't going to like what I have to say about &quot;The Cider House Rules,&quot; but as a critic with my own movie review show, my personal opinion is that this film was a joke. Not a &quot;funny, ha ha&quot; joke, but a &quot;predictable, blah blah blah&quot; joke.First, I have to say that the nomination for &quot;Picture Of The Year&quot; that &quot;The Cider House Rules&quot; received was stolen from much better films from 1999, such as &quot;Magnolia&quot; and &quot;Being John Malkovich.&quot; Second, &quot;The Cider House Rules&quot; was just another example of the tired formula of Hollywood sneaking in the Independent Film formula of coming of age and passing it off in a different setting, hoping the audience doesn't catch on. And for the most part, it seems to have worked, achieving Oscar recognition. Tobey Maguire is an excellent actor, so it's sad to see him waste his time on such a predictable script. Especially the last half hour of the movie, which seems to get more jumbled as the movie reaches its end. It's like the author, who was writing the script based on his own book, realized that he only had 30 minutes left to work with, so he had to squeeze 200 pages into that time. The result is a film that feels the audience is far too dumb to understand the messages it's trying to get across, so it bludgeons the viewer into unconsciousness with its message. It's like the film keeps poking you with a stick while asking, &quot;Do you get it yet? Huh? Huh? Do you get it? Bet you didn't see that one coming!&quot; But you know what, you do see it coming.All in all, I'm not trying to tell you what to think on the subject of the film. I'm just saying that the film does a poor job of explaining the material. It's like the film is making up excuses for everything, except for coming up for an excuse for its own failure as a movie.",The Cider House Rules VHS

It's one of those personally affecting movies that prompts fans to quote from it, and my favorite moment after all these years is (as it is for some of these other writers) Maude flinging Harold's charm into the river, because now she'll &quot;always know where it is.&quot;  That was my first taste of movie profundity, and I've never lost it.If you haven't seen the movie yet, you can probably read some of these posts and not have it ruined for you.

663077,"This disc contains the first 4 episodes of the 11 episode show Hand Maid May.  There's no question HMM is a terribly cute and funny show.  The basic dynamics are fairly common in anime: quiet, sensitive boy finds himself surrounded by interested girls.  In poor Kazuya's case, most of the girls are androids--and one of those is a maid named May who's the size of a Barbie.  The hows and whys of this all make sense within the context of the show; the drama (to the extent there is any, for this is a comedy) involves how Kazuya's going to pay the $1.45 million bill for May, or otherwise keep her from being repossessed.  The character designs range from adorable to gorgeous, and the English dub cast is filled with experienced voice actors who do great jobs.There's only two potentially negative things to say about HMM.  Neither made me lower my rating, but they might affect yours.  First, this show is filled to overflowing with fan service: camera angles showing girls' underwear, girls bending over, and just generally bouncy girls.  There's no actual nudity--it almost seems like an experiment to see how far a show can go and still remain mostly cute.  While I could do without so much, it's basically innocent: Kazuya's too shy to do anything about it except blush.The second problem is the annoying DVD menu: when the disc loads, you're presented with a puzzle of sorts; you can't watch anything without figuring it out.  It's an exact copy of the Japanese DVD release, so purists might like it, but it slows things down, doesn't make any sense, and doesn't add to the show in any way.  Hopefully, future discs will have better menus, but HMM is a 5 star show despite these issues.",Hand Maid May: Maid to Order - Volume 1

203486,"This is an entertaining video - I was delighted to see the concert clips of Janis singing. I'm glad someone was recording her singing live in concert; it truly shows the powerful and passionate performer that she was.  However, I came away with the feeling that deep inside, Janis was really a sad person despite her success and free-spirit. This is evident in the interview at her high school reunion. One can also tell in the various interview clips whether she was on something, drunk, or straight.Janis was truly a unique and gifted yet tormented woman who, to this date, no other singer can surpass. She embodied the spirit of the 60's and there will never be another like her. It's such a shame she died so young.",Janis: The Way She Was VHS

252192,"Ughh. It was a rainy day when I watched this film, and as dreary as the day was outside, this film managed to beat it.  Edmund Purdom stars as the Egyptian in the title, a physician who starts out with the right ideals, but gets sidetracked often. The film follows his journey from nobody to the Pharaoh's personal doctor to nobody again.  Along the way he encounters ambitious soldier Victor Mature, barmaid with the bangs Jean Simmons, one-eyed conman Peter Ustinov, wimpy Pharaoh Micheal Wilding, hard as nails sister of the Pharaoh Gene Tierney, and vamping Bella Darvi, the femme fatale.  Those characters may sound interesting, but they're not in the least.  Maybe it's the terrible writing, but the performances are flat and dry, although Darvi was so awful she had me laughing, which at least got a reaction from me.  The Egyptian neither inspired or moved me.  I suspect it could have been better, although the writing, acting, and directing would have needed a complete overhaul.  I would recommend watching some of the other historical epics of the Fifties before choosing this one.",N/A

She runs away with a group of maiden ladies on a sea voyage to New Orleans where the women seek husbands. But not our heroine, her spirits are not ready for harnessing. This attracts our swashbuckling hero played by Nelson Eddy, who saves her from surly ugly pirates and the stuffy king himself.

9716,"Philadelphia was Jonathan Demme's follow up to Silence Of The Lambs.  Doing a 180 degree turn in stories, Philadelphia is basically a courtroom drama with Andrew Beckett, who is a gay man with the AIDS virus, suing his former employer, Wexler, Wheeler, a large, powerful and influential Philadelphia law firm, for wrongful termination based on discrimination due to his medical condition. Andy is an up and coming lawyer who is given a big and important case.  At a meeting with the partners, one of them notices a lesion on his head, but Andy makes a story up about it.  Andy works on the case while having some complications from his sickness.  He completes the work, but at the eleventh hour, the case is mysteriously lost and all records are lost.  The files are found, but Andy is terminated supposedly for incompetence and a bad attitude.  Andy decides to sue, but is turned down by many law firms, including Joe Miller who is an ambulance chaser with over the top TV ads, as they are afraid of the case.  Andy decides to represent himself, but when Joe, who is black, sees the treatment Andy receives at a law library, he agrees to represent him.  Joe has prejudices of his own as he hates homosexuals, but he believes Andy's rights have been violated.  Tom Hanks is absolutely stunning as Andy.  We see him slowly succumb to his disease and his transformation is startling.  He depicts Andy with grace and avoids any stereotypical characterizations.  Denzel Washington is equally amazing as Joe Miller.  He plays the role with the right amount of force, but peels back the layers to show an understanding side.  Joe is a blowhard and hardheaded, but in the end shows compassion.  Jason Robards is commanding as Mr. Wheeler, the bigwig at the law firm and Joanne Woodward plays Andy's mother with class. Mr. Demme gives a real feel for the city of Philadelphia. The movie was the first mainstream Hollywood film to make the subject of AIDS its main plotline.  The film walks a fineline and avoids becoming too preachy. Mr. Hanks deservedly won his first of his two consecutive Best Actor Oscars, but Mr. Washington was every bit his equal.  Bruce Springsteen also won an Oscar for his haunting song &quot;Streets Of Philadelphia&quot;.",N/A
535377,"Hmm... okay... where to begin...This is the kind of self-babble I'm left with in trying to think of things to write about in this, my review of &quot;Dude, Where's My Car?,&quot; a movie so ridiculously conceived and scripted, so reundant in it gags and one-liners, so absolutely mind-melting that to watch it is to realize a new level of stupidity. But that doesn't mean it's not fun.There's the most basic of plots: Jesse and Chester, two stoners whose vocabulary consists of relentless utterings of &quot;dude&quot; and &quot;sweet,&quot; wake up one morning to realize that Jesse's car is missing, and they have no recollection of the previous night. As they set out to find the car, they begin to piece together the silly, unbelievably outrageous events of the previous night, from a tryst in a strip club with a transsexual stripper who gave them a suitcase full of cash, to encounters with different groups of nerdy, busty, and macho aliens, all demanding from them a device known as the continuum transfunctioner.And that's it, the entire plot of the movie, mixed in with some truly hearty laughs and some good yet goofy acting from two guys who know what they're doing. The movie works for the simple reason that Ashton Kutcher (Jesse) and Seann William Scott (Chester) do such a good job of acting completely stupid that they sell us on the whole stoner appearance of the movie. A film like this can't work without the mentality to back it up, and the absence of that mentality is just what it needs.There are laughs, and while some of them are forced, there are those that succeeded in getting more than just a chuckle out of me. The two guys' mentality is one gag, but the movie also makes us laugh by playing their girlfriends, known as &quot;The Twins,&quot; to be just as air-headed as they are. A chinese fast food drive-thru results in an hilarious explosion of anger, while the whole girls-with-big-hoo-hoos mentality runs throughout.There's really not a whole lot more to say about this movie... it's stupid, it's ridiculous... it makes its characters out to be heroes in the most contrived situations imaginable, and there's no shortage of brainless dialogue and actions. But, for what it's worth, it's not a total waste of time, and I found myself laughing in all the right places.","Dude, Where's My Car?"
675309,"&quot;Wingspan&quot;, as noted, purports to be one thing but clearly becomes another.While we certainly feel his warmth of memories to his late wife, Linda, the story of Wings had little directly to do with her. Wings was a performing and recording band, they played concerts and made records.  But what is also impossible to argue, Linda McCartney's actual contributions to either live shows or records was minimal.  Those records and shows rested in the hands of Paul and his able band of musicians.What's disappointing is how little we really know of the MUSIC of Wings from this DVD.  How little of the musicians, how they came into the group, what became of them, how they contributed.  That's a real shame; they worked hard to keep up with an ex-Beatle, to do him and themselves proud, and make records that could stand up to the legacy of Paul McCartney.Instead, we get to know more about Linda McCartney than perhaps we really need to know.  It's no surprise that their love was incredibly strong - we've known that all along, they were very open, public and direct about that.  And her impact on his life was, without question, immeasurable.  But, it is also fair to say that her direct impact on the music of Wings was VERY measurable, and the overemphasis on her contributions defeats the thesis of this program.It's unfair to diminish Linda McCartney's place in the life of her famous husband, but it's equally unfair to overshadow with her memory the fine collaborations of the various members of Wings.  That's the real Wings story, and sadly, you won't find much of it here.",Paul McCartney - Wingspan - An Intimate Portrait
30441,"Atom Egoyan's &quot;The Sweet Hereafter&quot; belongs on the list as one of the ten best movies of the 1990s.  It is a movie in which the plot, a lawyer attempts to make a big civil case out of a tragic school bus accident, is almost incidental.  What matters are the performances, the mood and the spellbinding out of sequence storytelling.  Ian Holm and Sara Polley lead a uniformly excellent cast.  Both are haunted by secret tragedies in their lives that show on their faces more than in their words.  Polley survived the crash, but is paralized and doted upon by the guilt ridden father who had committed incest with her before the accident.  Holm is a man tortured by a manipulative and drug addled daughter who knows how to exploit his emotions to her own ends.  In between, is the sad small Canadian town that lost most of its children to the accident.  All of this sounds bleakly depressing, and yet curiously it is not because of the way the beautiful way the movie is filmed and sequenced.  The use of the &quot;Pied Piper&quot; story as a literary subtext is the kind of unique touch that gives the film its power.Had Hollywood any imagination, &quot;The Sweet Hereafter&quot; would have swept the Oscars the year it was released.

Unknown to them, the site of the loot is the territory of a local black gang, who happen to stop by to murder one of their enemies on the same day that the two white firemen have come to salvage the gold. Tension mounts as one of the firemen witnesses the murder and becomes the target of the heavily-armed gang. To complicate matters, the gangleaders, played to a superbly menacing effect by rappers Ice T. and Ice Cube, and fuelled by virulent racial hostility, discover that gold is at stake and the suspense and violence escalate to a terrific scale. The film is more or less a revamp of &quot;The Treasure of the Sierra Madre&quot; in its exploration of avarice, betrayal and gold-hunting, though given an updated technological touch with the ample use and misuse of automatic weapons and plastic explosives, especially in the last few reels. A haunting, claustraphobic, sometimes exciting effect is generated by veteran helmsman Walter Hill (a specialist in violent, action-filled thrillers) with his skilfully paced direction and inventive deployment of camera angles, which amplify the situation of the two firemen, as they struggle to escape from the dilapidated building they find themselves trapped in, and enemies setting out to take their lives.

432055,"The best thing about Kevin Smith is that he tries to make movies that consciously walk the path *not* of least resistance. He always runs the risk of having the whole endeavor blow up in his face (as happened with the flawed by still worthwhile &quot;Mallrats&quot;). But when things go right, and thankfully Smith is such a talent that can pull this off more often than not, it's like getting diamonds from coal.In &quot;Chasing Amy&quot; Smith is still prone to moments of misstep. An emotional scene near its middle, where one character professes their love for another, takes place during a rainstorm. It's a tired movie cliche that's made worse by well-placed thunder claps. The scene didn't need any meteorology commentary; it had enough weight in the writing. And Smith, in a weakness he has admitted to, tends to fall in love with twenty-cent words. At times this tendency gets in the way of the reality of his dialogue. But those times are few and far between, and really, nitpicking about the smartness of Kevin Smith's dialogue is like admonishing God for making giraffes too tall.There. By pointing out the above inconsequential mistakes, I now have free reign to gush over the rest of the movie.This is one of my three favourite contemporary romantic comedies (that holy trinity also includes &quot;Before Sunrise&quot; and &quot;Say Anything'&quot;), not because I find either of the leads particularly appealing, but because it asks so many valuable questions about the nature of romance itself. Is sexuality a choice? Can we decide whom we love? How fine is the line between platonic and romantic love? Smith wraps these tough questions up in loads of humourous pop culture references, to make them go down easier. &quot;Star Wars&quot;, &quot;Jaws&quot;, and, bless Kevin's heart, legendary Canadian teen-com &quot;Degrassi Junior High&quot; are all included. Fans of Kevin's previous works will also revel in his moments of self-referentiality, as many aspects of his View Askewniverse are brought back to bring life to the film's background.Ben Affleck, as the cynical hipster comic book dude who's in touch with his emotions and his passions, had a tough task here. His wasn't as outrageous a character as those around him. He had to be real, to provide the film with some firm ground to take off from. And even though it's one of the (relatively) weakest performances in the film, Affleck has enough movie-star charisma about him (this is not post-&quot;Good Will Hunting&quot; revisionist history I'm indulging in; I felt this way the first time I saw the film in '97, when he was a relative unknown) to make Holden a character you don't mind spending two hours with. (Note to Kevin: given the accessibility of modern CGI technology, can you *please* fill in the left side of Ben's hastily grown goatee? It's lopsided, and quite distracting!)Joey Lauren Adams also had a tough task. Her character, Alyssa Jones, is essentially based on her (Smith has admitted that his relationship with Adams provided an autobiographical framework for the story he tells here). She is an earnest pixie, full of energy and spunk and adventure. It sounds like it would be an easy role to play, the lesbian who falls in love with a man, in the hand of a less thoughtful screenwriter. But Smith furnishes Alyssa with an armload of prudence and passion, a level head, and a complicated past. Adams plays all of these angles with perfect precision.These two prospective lovers are ably supported by a duo of wonderful characters. Dwight Ewell plays Hooper X, a comic book artist with a schizophrenic persona (he &quot;talks like Louis Farrakhan on stage, and the King of Pop off&quot;). Ewell manages both sides of his character beautifully. There's a great scene in a record store, where he runs into a young fan, and must turn on the black militant rage in an instant. When the kid's gone, he gets this goofy grin on his face, incredulous at the act he must put on just to sell comics. Jason Lee, as Holden's best friend and &quot;inker&quot; Banky, has an army of scatological lines to deliver, which he does with deadpan precision. Banky is a loyal trooper, a man whose passions are worn on his sleeve and is unapologetic about them. His shining moment comes when he gives a young boy a quick education on skin mags. But Lee is also good when not in full-blown Banky mode. If not for this restraint he gives to the character, the friendship between Banky and Holden (their comic book is published under the name &quot;Bank Holdup&quot;' ha!) would be implausible.Of course any Kevin Smith movie would be incomplete without an appearance by those pot-dealing knuckleheads Jay (Jason Mewes) and Silent Bob (Smith himself). They only appear in a brief scene at the end, which is probably just enough screentime. The one thing I'll say about this scene is that I get a kick out of the fact that Smith delivers the first line of his vital monologue (it happens to be the movie's title) while he's got his fingers in his mouth biting his nails. Hee-hee.I've always found the ending problematic. It's a bold step to go out on that just barely works; I just can't buy the fact that one of the characters would make such a stupid decision. It's a necessary plot point, but one that falters slightly. Still, it's only a minor quibble in what is mostly a flawless movie.",Chasing Amy VHS
533540,"In a word, Crouching Tiger is extraordinary, the true Best Picture of 2000.  Ang Lee combines a touching romance with well choreographed martial arts fight scenes to develop an excellent movie.Many detractors argue that Croutching Tiger is nothing new in terms of martial arts films from Asia.  Having seen a number of HK movies, I would have to both agree and disagree.  The action sequences are not as extravagant as some other Asian martial arts movies, but it was also more realiztic to watch.  In addition, I would argue that the plot is much more robust.The fact that this movie was subtitled does not detract from this film at all.  At times, the translations do not fully convey the meaning of what was spoken, but most of the information is conveyed.Strong acting performances by Chow Yun Fat and Michelle Yeoh, breathe-taking cinematography, and exciting action sequences make Croutching Tiger a movie to own and watch multiple times.","Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon VHS"

Effects, Makeup, Sets are all top notch.Truly inspired design and great humor(Kris Kattan will never be funnier than this)! If you are a Tim Burton fan, you will go nuts over this one, but keep in mind he had nothing to do with the project. I understand it didn't do well at the box office, but don't let that make you think that it's because it's a bad movie. That's just because Fox didn't want to advertise for their 80 million dollar feature(yeah, I'm still clueless on that one). I have a feeling this will develop a huge cult following once it's been on DVD/video long enough. I just hope it's in THX with some nice behind the scenes features. And like others have said, IT'S NOT A KIDS MOVIE!!! (12-25 year old range). But it just seems that Woopie Goldberg has a cameo in every movie ever made!",Monkeybone
187022,"This is a first rate war movie, right up there with Saving Private Ryan or Thin Red Line. But, to really understand it, first you have to be from Croatia, Serbia, Slovenia or Bosna/Herzegovina. Second, you must be smart and intelligent enough to see through it and third, you must not have dear friends and family killed in a war.That's a pretty tall order, I know...At first sight, the movie looks as pure Milosevic's propaganda and it's obvious why is that. It was the only way it could get made. But the authors were smarter, so they did what Verhoeven did with &quot;Starship Troopers&quot;- an all-out SF action for the masses and clever satire for the classes.The story revolves around two friends (a Serb and A Muslim) who end up on different sides in the war (naturally), one being sieged by the other (both with their troops) in the unfinished tunnel of &quot;Brotherhood and Unity&quot; (excellent parallel, watch out for many more) somehwere in Bosnia... Terror, despair, friendship turned sour, people fooled by propaganda... All come out through the memories of better times for all peoples of the Balkans.The telling of the story is rather complex, but you'll get it on your second or third viewing, if you can stomach it. Some scenes are quite disturbing, so watch out. This is not for children at all...","Pretty Village, Pretty Flame"

It doesnt even have anything to do with the other ones, besides a brief mention of gatlin and &quot;He who walks behind the rows&quot; but its just a very brief mention and doesnt really tie into the horrible plot. Also let me say that I,m not strict when rating horror movies, I have liked a lot of them, while others hated them, but I dont see how anyone could watch this movie all the way through without falling asleep or simply dying of total boredom. I mean the only words that the kids use through the first hour of the film is &quot;Kill&quot; over and over, It really gets annoying, and the death scenes are also very weak with little to no gore, The sequels before had very graphic, bloody murders.

396346,"DW Griffth created the first epic movie in the world in 1915.  He chose a topic and subject he and the world was obsessed with, the Civil War.  Many Hollywood films of the day were about the Civil War and the human stories of that war.  Griffth was a son of a Confederate Colonel from that war.  He had deep feelings and beliefs from his family hertiage.  1915 was the 50th Annivserary of the ending of the Civil War.  Many Civil War veterans were still alive and like Spielbergs &quot;Saving Private Ryan&quot; the veterans were dying at a very high rate so this was a vehicle to launch a Classic Epic movie of rememberence.  The first of such a film that changed the world, film making and censorship forever.DW Griffith chose the 1906 book &quot;The Clansman&quot; by Rev. Thomas Dixon Jr.  Actually up to the final premier date Griffith was using the book title finally and wisely chose a new title &quot;Birth of a Nation&quot;.Summary: Story is about the abolishment of slavery in America.  The southern sanction refused to follow suit so state cessation occurs.  &quot;Birth of a Nation&quot; takes us through the Civil War, President Lincolns assaination, to the Reconstruction, Carpetbaggers and the  conception of the Klu Klux Klan.  This is brillantly done by Griffiths vision of the viewer observing through the eyes of the northern family the &quot;Stonemans&quot; and the southern family the &quot;Camerons&quot;.  We follow there lives through this complex web of controversy.To understand the scope of this epic you must understand the world of 1915 and the people who lived then.  That this movie toured the world for 2 years in all the top theatres getting up to $2.00 a ticket.  Can you imagine that???  People were only making as little as 5 cents an hour wages.  A 24 minute &quot;Making of Birth of a Nation&quot; is quite helpful in understanding this time and its people.  I recommend you watch this 24 minute clip first.  This movie was voted into the TOP 100 films of the last 100 years by the American Film Institute (AFI) in 1998.",N/A
165702,"This movie can be watched over again without getting bored and often with finding a little bit that missed detection the last time.  It is extremely clever and one of Murrays' best films, perhaps second only to &quot;What about Bob?&quot;.  Murray finds himself caught in an endless loop, waking up to the same day over and over.  Finding out that he can spend endless time practicing the piano, trying to get MacDowell to fall for him or just learning personal bits of information about the townspeople.  The results are very funny and while we never quite learn how long actually passes during the film, i.e. How many days does he live in this loop?, we never quit rooting for Murray to figure it all out and get the girl.The film editing in this movie is excellent, we watch as Murray gets slapped, slapped again, slapped over and over till finally he starts to learn a little bit about treating others and avoids the slap, only to make another gross mistake and have to learn the next lesson.  Never slow, this romantic comedy (with a little bit about life in general thrown in) is a very strong recommendation.",N/A
345456,"Bergman himself considers &quot;Cries and Whispers&quot; to be one of his best films, and many viewers would agree.  It is intense, dark, and moving, with many scenes that cling ruthlessly to the memory.Unfortunately, the movie is both stagey and self-conscious, lacking the fine subtlety that characterizes such films as &quot;Persona&quot; and &quot;Wild Strawberries,&quot; and without the natural candor of &quot;Scenes from a Marriage.&quot;  &quot;C&amp;W&quot; is dominated by a sea of red colors and overly-obvious stage setting in the style of Munch's paintings.  A tableau based on Michelangelo's Pieta is especially heavy-handed.Despite these problems -- or perhaps even because of them -- newcomers to Bergman or to &quot;art films&quot; may find the extra finger-pointing helpful and inoffensive.  Others who are looking for a similarly dark treatment in a color movie by Bergman might prefer &quot;Autumn Sonata.&quot;  In any case, &quot;C&amp;W&quot; is an essential film for all of us Bergman fanatics: its many points of brilliance -- especially in the first half -- manage to outshine its nontrivial weaknesses.",N/A

513966,"We bought this movie for the kids, but after watching it the first time, we knew that this was one my wife and I could enjoy just as much as the kids.  The basic plot of the movie is this:  The Iron Giant, an alien robot of tremendous size and power, crash-lands on Earth for reasons unknown.  Although the Giant has the power to &quot;fix&quot; physical damage, he has somehow been damaged mentally so that he has lost memory of all of his powers.  His crash-landing does not go unnoticed by the government, which sends an agent to investigate (the story is set in 1957, at the height of Sputnik-inspired paranoia).  Meanwhile, the Giant has made the acquaintance of young Hogarth Hobbs, a boy living with his working mom in a small Maine town.  The whereabouts of Hogarth's dad are never explicity made clear, but you do get a brief glimpse of a photo in Hogarth's room of a fighter pilot and his plane, presumably Dad, lost in Korea (just my theory).  The story pretty much revolves around the agent's attempts to find the Giant (with the aid of a few indiscretions by Hogarth, who really needs to keep better track of his stuff), and Hogarth's attempts to keep the Giant away from the government's clutches, while at the same time developing a relationship with the Giant that is very reminiscent of Elliot and E.T.  Hogarth gets some help in this effot from Dean, the local hippie type who runs the local junkyard (which is good for the Giant, who needs to eat scrap metal to survive).At first, the Giant seems to be nothing more than a big robot.  But, as Hogarth learns to communicate with him, we learn that the Giant has feelings and a big heart.  He doesn't want to play &quot;bad robot&quot; to Hogarth's pretend space hero, he wants to be Superman!  You can't help but like the big lug.The movie is well-written, with a lot of absolutely hilarious comedy as well as some real tear-jerker moments.  The quality of the animation is top-notch, especially the scene near the end when the Giant (who can fly) is being confronted by three VERY well-drawn F-86 Sabre jets.An EXCELLENT movie, which everyone can enjoy.  I can't imagine anyone not liking it.  But, don't take my word for it - pick it up!",The Iron Giant

Based on a Daphne DuMaurier story, this tale of the supernatural, set in Venice, is extremely intelligent, and opens doors for much analysis of how and why thoughts of the supernatural obsess people as they do. Roeg's interest in self-reflexivity in cinema, more fully realized in BAD TIMING, is invoked here as well; Sutherland and Christie give excellent performances; and, lowbrow as it seems to say this, the sex scene between them is one of the most interesting and intense in the history of mainstream cinema.

136679,"Although most people think of the 1960's as the heyday of the woman's liberation movement, in truth the movement dates back to the turn of the century with the suffragettes' crusade for the women's right to vote.  In the 1940's, the movement gained a great deal of momentum as ""Rosie the Riveter"" became symbolic of women holding down jobs during WWII that were traditionally done by men.  When the war ended and the men came home to reclaim their jobs, the battle of the sexes really began.  Women had exploded the myth of not being as capable as men and now they began demanding not just the vote, but equality in all things.  Made in 1949, ""Adam's Rib"" is a comedy that addressed one of the most hotly contested issues of the day.This is the fifth in a series of ten collaborations between Katharine Hepburn and Spencer Tracy.  This film was written by Ruth Gordon and Garson Kanin, a team that wrote two of the ten Hepburn/Tracy films (""Pat and Mike"" was the other).  Gordon and Kanin generally wrote stories that were patterned after their own marriage, and were nominated for an Oscar for this screenplay.  Katharine Hepburn always sought out roles that had a strong female character and Tracy enjoyed playing the traditional male trying to tame the tiger.  They were perfect for one another.  Their films were very popular because they were able to bring humor to a painful transition that was occurring all across America, the re-evaluation of women's roles in society.This story seems silly by today's standards, showing how far we've come.  A woman shoots her husband for cheating on her, and Amanda (Katharine Hepburn) decides to represent her as her defense counsel.  Her husband Adam (Spencer Tracy) is the prosecutor in the case.  Sparks fly between attorneys in the courtroom and the bedroom as the battle of the sexes ensues.  Much of it is in jest, but the film does a good job of making fun of the battle without mocking the women's cause.  The film whimsically makes the point that the issues are not black and white, and that the ideal of totally equality is impeded by numerous immutable differences between men and women.One of the most anachronistic elements has nothing to do with sex.  The idea that shooting one's spouse for infidelity is justifiable, whether man or woman, would be ludicrous in today's society.  In 1949, however, it was the generally held belief that home wreckers who were shot had gotten what was coming to them.  Amanda succeeds at arguing that this standard of justifiable assault should apply to women as well as men, but today a jury would laugh its way all the way to a guilty verdict regardless of the sex of the defendant.As always, Tracy and Hepburn are terrific together, with probably the best screen chemistry of any male/female team in the history of films.  Adam is always ribbing Amanda about her feminism (giving the title a double entendre) and defeats her in the end using one of her own female tricks.  Cole Porter contributes an original song ""Farewell Amanda"" which is a beautiful tune rendered trite by incessant repetition.  David Wayne is the only discordant note, elevating an annoying character to unbearably obnoxious with his snide delivery.This excellent comedy was relevant in its time, but it hasn't aged well because the times have changed (which may be all the more reason to see it).  I rated it a 9/10.  The battle of the sexes has never been so much fun.",N/A
553645,"Sisters is a psycological thriller that maintains your interest with its deliberate pacing, eerie imagery, and excellant camera work. Most notable is the unique split screen shot that shows the murder victim spell help with his blood from his vantage point as well as the lady's vantage point in the adjacent building.  Other interesting camera work abounds.  Margot Kidder is alluring, but average.  Charles Durning is a goofball who adds comedic touches where they are needed (note the ending).  The guy who plays the doctor/husband looks like Doc on Loveboat after a few drinks (scary).  The Grace Collier character is interesting as well.  Ultimately we follow her as she tries to solve the mystery (Hitchcock technique). The soundtrack is terrific even tough it could have come from the Psycho sessions (from Pyscho's Herrmann).  This film has a certain charm in that it takes time to tell the story.  Modern films often rely on slick editing but ultimately lacks substance.  This film does have some substance as it probes the relationship between siamese twin sisters and their physical not psychological splitting..  The film is only predictable in that it was made almost 30 years ago and we are jaded.  The dream/hypnotic sequences are perhaps the most interesting because they propel the story, disclose important information, and places the antgonist literally in the protagonist' skin.  As always Criterion has put out a superb DVD with a good looking transfer.  It is a little lean on the extras though.  This film truly is disturbIng, even shockingly violent.

407872,"What is demonstrated most clearly in HEAT is the different directions taken by De Niro and Pacino in the 20+ years since they were young actors in THE GODFATHER and THE GODGFATHER PART II.Pacino, who was such a thrill to watch in his early days, is now almost unbearable.  He's lost any sense of subtlety or depth.  In THE GODFATHER there was a quiet rage, an anger and intensity that bubbled just under his surface that was just amazing to watch.  Now he just screams every line.  In HEAT he cackles and yells in every scene, hollering at traffic, hollering at his wife, hollering at De Niro, hollering out his breakfast order...it just never stops.  'Round about SCARFACE Pacino stopped being an actor--and he'd been a great one up until that point--and started being a very bad caricature of himself.  I call it the Marty Scheen syndrome.De Niro, on the other hand, was already great at GODFATHER PART II, and has spent his time since then perfecting his craft.  He's become the best actor of his generation, (unless you put Jack Nicholson in the same generation, and then it's a tie), an actor who can do action, thrillers, comedy--whatever.  He is the best.As for the film itself, I'm not as taken with it as many others seem to be.  It's a good action flick, but I wouldn't put DIE HARD in the same category as APOCOLYPSE NOW, if you get my drift.  HEAT is good at what it tries to do, but I don't know that it tries to do very much.All this talk of &quot;dissecting the psychology&quot; of a cop and a criminal, finding out they're not that different, yadda yadda yadda--what a load of whooey.  The conversation De Niro and Pacino have over a cup of coffee, which could have been a great set piece for both their careers and a moment movie fans would be able to recall like Bogie getting drunk in CASABLANCA or Brando emerging from the darkness in APOCOLYPSE NOW, is tedious and contrived.  Pacino appears to make several blundering ad-libs, and you wouldn't be surprised to see De Niro come out of character long enough to ask him what the heck he's doing.And Val Kilmer's part is virtually non-existent.  Kilmer is a hit or miss actor--he hit on all cylinders in TOMBSTONE, missed on all in BATMAN--and this is mostly a miss.",Heat VHS
534125,"The sweltering Cuban countryside becomes a metaphor for the dual revolutions that co-exist in this film.  At once stunningly beautiful and heartbreakingly deppressed, &quot;Before NIght Falls&quot; testifies to the power of both the forces of nature and the innate condition of the human self.  Javier Bardem is brilliant as the noted writer Reinaldo Arenas, who was publicly humiliated by the Castro regime for daring to tell the truth, about his country, the revolution itself, and his own inner self.  Edited to resemble a rollercoaster ride, viewers might find themselves lost on occassion by the mix of political and personal stroies, told against the backdrop of a persecuting dictatorship that has thus far existed survived beyond anyone's wildest expectations.  To the director's credit, the Cuban landscape is etched with majestic beauty and pathos, at once incredibly beautiful and yet bittersweet, as if all the color had been drained from it.  Bardem does a wonderful job of conveying Arena's mixture of pain and hope, first showing the support the writer had for Castro and then seeing the personal pain the dictator imposed.  The prison sequences, some of which are told in dream settings, are forceful and rich, evocative of &quot;Midnight Express&quot; and yet intensely personal.  While the film portrays the artist's reality in a manner some viewers found difficult to take, its nightmarish vision of how the Cuban people have suffered is notable.  Few films have dared to delve into such challenging themes, and fewer still have gone within a Latino culture that at once celebrates its machoisms yet cheers the humiliation of its own.  In some ways, &quot;Before Night Falls&quot; is a testament to the power of personal will and the search for freedom, both from one's politics and one's own self.  The ending sequences, which involve dramatic and lucid moments of utter fear and pain drive home the message that sometimes, even freedom comes with a price (in this case AIDS.)  Some audience members might find the film too harried and rushed, but &quot;Before Night Falls&quot; is deeply moving and well worth a viewing.",N/A
149089,"With every entry into the &quot;Man With No Name&quot; trilogy, Sergio Leone became more and more comfortable with his overwhelming sense of style. And &quot;The Good, The Bad And The Ugly&quot; is the pinnacle of his talent. Nothing less than a stylistic masterpiece. It would be nice to see movies today take the risks that this one does.The cinematography is nothing less than amazing. Leone could have almost been a director of silent movies. So much is carried in the images. Much more so than in the lines these characters deliver. So much has been mentioned of his striking use of close-ups and staging of action set pieces, but that merely scratches the surface of a deep tapestry.Aiding this mastery is Ennio Morricone's legendary score. Though his over-dramatic tone during the civil war elements is curious, it doesn't fault the film. There is more here to appreciate than can be heard in one viewing.The acting here is also top notch. Eastwood is again dominating. Lee Van Cleef, (who played a different character in &quot;For A Few Dollars More&quot;) makes an intimidating villian. And Eli Wallach pretty much steals the movie as the &quot;Ugly&quot; part of the equation. Their grizzled faces seem absolutely mythical in Leone's vision.Overall this is the best in the series and one of the finest westerns ever made. It manages to be considerably more thoughtful than it's predecessors. Yet taken together they seem to tower over most other westerns. And as someone who admires a man's willingness to fully engage his creative vision, this film stands out as a milestone of visual technique. In the final showdown all the tension is created through the carefully crafted score and every intricate image. Amazing considering that we are simply watching men staring at each other. Yet it is mind bogglingly riveting. With this film Leone finally let go of all restraint. And &quot;The Good The Bad And The Ugly&quot; is so much the better for it.",N/A

302243,"World War II adventure film about a Royal Air Force fighter-bomber squadron assigned to destroy a Nazi rocket fuel facility in Norway. Cliff Robertson headlines the movie as a former Eagle Squadron pilot in command of 633 Squadron with a colorful assembly of international pilots. They embark on the hazardous assignment with the target located inside a Norwegian fjord, guarded by an immense array of anti-aircraft artillery. Worth noting is the story was probably inspired by the real-life exploits of RAF Mosquito squadrons that conducted such dangerous missions, hunting down Nazi ship convoys along Norway's rugged coastline.The real attraction of this film is abundant footage of authentic World War II-era De Havilland Mosquito bombers used for the movie production. The scenes of these rare aircraft in flight are a delight, especially since there the are no airworthy examples left in the entire world today (the last one was lost with its crew in a tragic crash in 1996). The model airplane special effects are too obvious, especially when compared to the quality of ""The Bridges of Toko Ri"" starring William Holden. Nonetheless, it's still pretty exciting and viewers can't help but compare the squadron's climatic attack in the treacherous fjord with ""Star War's"" Jedi attack on the Empire's Death Star.The script and several scenes could have been better, but the authentic aircraft are worth watching. Overall a decent adventure, dated, but enjoyable if you're a fan of the famous De Havilland Mosquito fighter-bomber built of wood, and flown by pilots in daring missions that helped win World War II.For those interested, there's a nice De Havilland aircraft museum north of London, England, on the actual grounds where these impressive aircraft were built.

287016,"Zabriskie Point is probably more famous for the soundtrack than it is for the movie.  The main attraction of the soundtrack was three Pink Floyd songs, written before the album, Atom Heart Mother.  It also contains a nice 7 minute Jerry Garcia acoustic instrumental.  The soundtrack album was always a must have for any Pink Floyd/Grateful Dead fan.The odd thing is that this movie is almost devoid of music.  The movie starts and ends with a Pink Floyd track, and most of the Garcia track is played during the psychodelic love scene.  Other than that, there are only snippets of the songs from the soundtrack album.  There are large stretches of the film where there is no music at all.  You would think that a movie that was supposed to be a reflection of the times in America would need a background of music, since music was so important to the whole scene.Forget about the music....is it a good movie?  Not really.  It starts out good, with students discussing politics.  But, the debate sounds false, like something an outsider would write.  It almost reminds me of how Dragnet would portray hippies; a parents view of how young people were acting.  Then the movie goes off on a tangent about the hero stealing a plane.  Most of it has nothing to do with the times.There are some beautifully filmed sequences in the movie.  However, alot of it is just a travelogue, with long, silent passages, or just the drone of an engine.  The whole thing might have worked better if there was background music to pull it all together.  The love scene is very good.  And the ending is pretty spectacular (but kind of a let down after reading all the raves about it).  But this a great example of how the music from Pink Floyd adds so much power to the scene.  Note that this scene was featured on the Oscars telecast a couple of years ago.The soundtrack was originally released as a single LP.  There is a new version of the soundtrack that contains a second CD.  The second CD contains 30 minutes of Jerry Garcia and 25 minutes of Pink Floyd music that was not used in the movie.  It is a shame.  The music could have gone a long way to making this a better movie.",N/A
458639,"One of the best movies ever. The eye candy provided in the technique of oil-painting on film screen (newly developed for this movie) makes the film worth seeing by itself- it's one of the most beautiful sights I have ever seen in my life (on- or off-screen). The metaphysics is unfortunately all over the map and very off-target, but I don't recommend going to the movies for good theology. The movie does have some very inspiring messages about the need for hope; without which we die. I appreciated the perspective that hell is where people go when they no longer have hope- it made the best sense I had ever seen of the idea that suicides would go to hell. The basis of depression is a lack of hope, and lack of hope at it's basis is sin- in the sense of the original Hebrew, meaning &quot;to miss the mark&quot;. God's best for us was to have hope- to trust, and to have, as the Greek defines the word, &quot;expectant Joy&quot;. As expressed in What Dreams, suicide is the ultimate expression of a lack of hope- in essence one is choosing to not trust God, and choosing to not be in the place of hope, but the place of despair. If we are designed for hope, and choose to deny that, we have denied the basis of all reality. Annie chooses depression, and so her world becomes what she desires, and what she can handle- a world without hope. hell. Because of it's treatment of hope and despair, I would recommend that if you are feeling depressed, see this movie. It won't solve your problems, but it can begin to help you resolve them.",What Dreams May Come VHS
335484,"(zero stars) This film makes the home shopping network seem like Indiana Jones.Basically a guy dies at the beggining (you never even see this person) next thing you know, your sitting at his funeral.

144286,"As in the 1960's, in the future, you can't trust anybidy over 30.  The difference is that, in the 22nd century, anybody that old is supposed to be dead.  Nobody seems to mind that, since life until then is pleasure free, a non-stop party.  As a further inducement, those who hit their 30th get a splendid lastday party, complete with levitation, pyrtotechnics and a good chance of getting &quot;renewed&quot;.  Logan (Michael York) doesn't think anything's wrong with that, and as a &quot;sandman&quot; his job is to track down those who would try to outlive their lastday or even (shudder) try to escape the cozy confines of the domes - a computer managed megalopolis cut off from the outside world since an undescribed catastrophe.  When the Domed City's computer (with a sexy female voice) realizes that too many of these fugitives - called &quot;runners&quot; - remain unaccounted for, it &quot;volunteers&quot; Logan into going undercover as a runner by advancing him onto the terminal list.  Having already hooked up with a prospective runner - Jessica (Jenny Agutter) - Logan explores the periphery of the domed city and even makes the impossible leap into escaping to an outside world neither he nor Jessica (nor Francis, once Logan's former sandman colleague, now turned hunter) ever thought existed.Logan's Run is a fave for several reasons - it's incredibly dated, nobody would ever confuse this film with one made a few years earlier or (with Star wars) a few years later.  But that gives the film an identity that the script doesn't, unlike any anonymous late-night cable movie which could have been made anytime between 1992 and last week (Jerry Goldsmith's score certainly helps).  &quot;Run&quot; is also great because its message is deeper than its cheesy setting (a futuristic paradise committed to hedonism) would suggest.  Sure it looks like a cross between a mall and Tomorrowland, but anything less would dilute the shallowness of the domed city's pleasure-seeking denizens.  Worse, it would minimize the shock and release shared by Logan and Jessica.  Lastly, &quot;Run&quot; excels because it's so much better than the novel, in which their is no domed city (and no comfortable future to hold onto), and the charachters seem pretty resigned to the fact that their gonna die.  The book never offers its heroes the prospect of &quot;renewal&quot;, nor do they seem to embrace their cruel fates with anything approaching the gusto of those in the film.  Sci-fi heroes in these Star-Trek-the-next-Generation days are hailed for their brilliance in technological derring-do under fire, almsot as if techno-supermen.  When Logan asks the computer if the shortfall between missing and confirmed runners can be accounted for by those who have been &quot;renewed&quot;, the sexily-voiced computer is appropriately silent.  Logan's expression, now appropriately pained by the realization that there is no renewal, contains enough cognitive dissonance for 20 years worth of scripts.  And the reservoir remains untapped after 25 years.  Grab this film now before somebody in Hollywood learns the lesson, and makes a film far more insightful than this.",N/A
561408,"I'm sorry but this movie is a very poor movie in my opinion. The problem lies in that they are trying to spoof so many films and in doing so they forget one thing - it should be funny!The jokes come thick and fast, the only problem is that practically all of them are very unfunny. I can only really remember laughing one or two times but for the most part I kept on thinking that it had to get better, it's a pity it didn't, it just got worse.The actors seemed laboured at times and the jokes might have worked if they didn't carry them on too long. I mean once you've seen the mask change to a funny face that's okay but to see the mask take on many different expression well that's going a little too far. Most of the jokes or storyline you could see coming a mile away and although that may be okay, you weren't hit with a joke or a punchline that made the obviousness of the joke worth waiting for.It's a pity that this film failed so badly on the comedy front as it could have been so much better. After watching it all I could think of was that there was so many jokes that I had seen before and more importantly the jokes in other movies were that much better arranged.To sum up I would rent this movie before buying it so you can judge for yourself if it's worth adding to your collection. For me I will pass as I've seen everything before and done so much better. If you are looking for a comedy film stick with Blazing Saddles, it may be old and you've probably seen it before but it's still one funny film!",Scary Movie
535976,"&quot;Hannibal&quot; is everything that &quot;The Silence of the Lambs&quot; is not. So much does director Ridley Scott push the envelope with excessive bloodshed and drawn out sequences, that he loses touch with the magic of the first film, that which made the hairs on our neck stand up. The film is well acted and grand in scale, but without a familiar sense of dread and mystery to keep us intrigued, it chews itself to pieces.The film kicks into gear with a chase sequence that looks like a deleted scene from Scott's earlier film, &quot;Gladiator,&quot; as Clarice Starling, now played by Julianne Moore, guns down a well-known drug ring operator. Her conduct in apprehending the suspect gets her demoted, and for a good hour or so of the movie, she will spend most of her time rummaging through files on Hannibal Lecter, reprised by Anthony Hopkins, who escaped from the law at the end of the previous film.Her investigation leads her to Mason Verger, one of Lecter's victims, who is out for revenge. Verger is played by Gary Oldman, who is probably doomed to look like someone other than himself in any role he plays. His promise of a hefty reward catches the eye of an Italian police officer, who has spotted the famed cannibal masquerading as an art collector in Italy. He intends to turn Lecter in to Verger, ignoring the constant warnings from Starling and unaware of the real danger involved in meddling in Lecter's life.The setup is good, but the execution and payoff are constantly tedious. &quot;The Silence of the Lambs&quot; had a low-key feel to it, something not quite so Hollywood or glossy. Director Jonathan Demme was able to evoke genuine suspense and tension through his photography, the fittingly creepy and downtrodden score of Howard Shore, and through the unconventional and frightening connection between its two lead characters, Lecter and Clarice.Ridley Scott gives &quot;Hannibal&quot; all the guts (literally), grandeur and Hollywood glitz money can buy, something that this sequel does not need; in fact, it's a diminishing trait. His attention to cheap thrills with the use of violence and gory murders ruins the effect that Hannibal Lecter has on us. In the first film, he was frightening because of his ability to penetrate Clarice's mind, and through that, he found escape. Here, he is free to roam the Earth without worry, and witnessing his violence, I lost what little respect I had for him.This attention to gloss diminishes any mystery or intensity we may have had in the beginning. Unlike &quot;Lambs,&quot; which kept its secrets until the blazing, bloody end, &quot;Hannibal&quot; has no secrets to reveal. Starling's hunt for Lecter turns into a cat-and-mouse hunt, which comes too little to late towards the film's end. Those of us who know the relationship these two character had in the beginning know full well that any filmmaker would sooner hang himself than deny us a final confrontation involving the two. This confrontation is the cheese atop the cracker, a finale that is more laughable than it is horrific, and further decimates the connection of these two muddled souls.Anthony Hopkins still churns out a very kinetic performance as Lecter, employing wit and intelligence through his character. We may never feel anything for the new Lecter, but the old Hopkins has not changed a bit since his days behind a pane of glass. Julianne Moore takes over where Jodie Foster left off; her acting is wonderful. In fact, it's not really Foster that we miss, but the traits of her character from the previous outing. This Clarice is given little to go on, and doesn't grab the audience's attention quite like the past Clarice.High hopes and high expectations abound, &quot;Hannibal&quot; became one of 2001's most anticipated films, and one of its biggest disappointments as well. It's mind-boggling to see just how much cinema has changed in the last decade; &quot;Lambs&quot; is genuine, while &quot;Hannibal&quot; is standard fodder.",N/A

Ben Kingsley does a sub-par job, but with the way his character was written, you have no choice.The SFX were good, but not great. The music was haunting. The script was mediocre.

576476,"Let's not be confused: this movie is not intended to be more than it is, a light comedy that highlights Sandra Bullock's considerable talents. It succeeds admirably with its goal. &quot;Miss Congeniality&quot; is funny and well-paced, slapstick in parts, but all Sandra Bullock.Gracie Hart (Bullock) is a rough and tumble FBI agent who is both clumsy and skilled in self-defense, a woman who pounds her punching bag after a frustrating day at work. She is the unlikely candidate to go undercover at a beauty pageant, but she's the only one in the bureau office who looks good in a computerized bathing suit. Michael Caine is hilarious as the man in charge of making her over in two days, and Benjamin Bratt is convincingly clueless and charming as her friend and sudden supervisor. Candice Bergen and William Shatner, as the pageant's directors, are brilliant casting choices.While Sandra Bullock goes overboard at times making her character uncouth and uncoordinated, she completely carries this movie with her on-screen presence. Her makeover is convincing because Bullock never allows us to forget what lies underneath the sheen.The best part of the DVD is not the movie itself. It's the running commentary of Bullock and co-writer Marc Lawrence found in the special features menu. I almost watched this movie twice in one sitting as I listened to them joke and tell the background of the filming and writing from the beginning to the end of the movie.

163508,"It may be hard for some in today's &quot;every man for himself&quot; mentality to relate to the strong personal honor that underlies many characters in this movie. The central 'combat of wills' is between Saito, the Japanese ruler of a prison camp deep in asia, and Nicholson, who is a traditional multi-decade British soldier that has lived his entire adult life within the rules and structure of that system.As a lover of feudal Japanese culture, I found it fascinating as Saito claimed the heritage of &quot;Bushido&quot; (the 'way of the warrior' of the samurai), yet had no problem using all prisoners as slave labor in order to save his own neck. Instead of following the Geneva Convention and treating the prisoners as the &quot;rules&quot; insisted, he bent them in order to not have to commit seppuku (ritual suicide) because the train bridge was not finished in time.On the other hand, Nicholson refused to allow Saito to use his officers as laborers (although he didn't seem to mind his *men* being sent off to work the tracks) and goes into The Oven to suffer as a consequence. Later, when work is running behind, he even goes into the hospital and talks the sick men into helping out - risking their health and lives for the 'common good' of the railway (which in fact is helping his *enemy*).I wish the movie were a bit longer, so we could go even deeper into the various characters.

What complements the stories well are the great extra (omake) material and the animation. PQC's animation is crisp and detailed OAV quality work, not that cheap television-grade stuff.

138712,"I'm sorry, but I'll have to rain a little on this parade.  Perhaps &quot;Story&quot; was the hottest thing on Broadway in the late 1950s but its evolution into a Hollywood musical and its 40-year mellowing have not, in my opinion, kept it a classic--far from it.I like a lot of the music and choreography, though in tandem they become too much of a one-trick pony.  Come on, what do you think:  &quot;DA-dum, DA-dum, DA-dum/DA-dum&quot; pretty much expresses the synergy, doesn't it?  There are some great tunes here; I personally prefer &quot;Something's Coming&quot; to &quot;Maria,&quot; probably because &quot;Maria&quot; is so self-righteously spiritual.That's probably the root of my dislike of this musical.  It is so calculatingly GOOD FOR YOU.  It is social-workerish, but in an Eisenhower kind of way that hasn't worn well.  Consider that every time &quot;Maria&quot; sings, we have a singer dubbing for Natalie Wood (a Russo-American) pretending to be a Latina, and whenever her male counterpart sings we have another singer dubbing for another American (R. Beymer) pretending to be Latino.Now, I'm not the most Politically Correct guy in the world.  I thought it was insane when California banned smoking at its bars a couple of years ago since that was basically the only public space where it was still permitted.  It makes my gorge rise to call myself &quot;Euro-American&quot;; I'd rather be called &quot;white trash.&quot;  However, I do recognize condescension to an ethnic group when I see it and what may have been cutting-edge in 1957 or even 1961 is trite today.  I suppose that's why my favorite tune in the show is &quot;Office Krupke&quot; because its message hasn't changed:  15-year-old kids have figured out that the system runs for the adults' benefit, not theirs.I'm not saying every musical has to be relentlessly joyful, candy colored, or without social or political conventions.

332110,"'2001' has been called Kubrick's most optimistic film, the most explicit presentation of religious or spiritual impulse more tacitly glimpsed in films like 'Paths of Glory' or 'Barry Lyndon'.  With its monolith as godhead; tuning fork of the universe; the infinite made material; the solar system made crucifix; the revelation to man at his dawn; the warning to man at his most hubristic; the comfort to man in his despair and fear; connector of sun and moon; arbiter of Kubrick's beloved circle, an anti-Enlightenment circle of life that negates the linear progress of history, that suggests that nman is fundamentally un-improvable; but, more benevolently, perhaps a circle that returns man to his Creator, the Universe, the Infinite, makes him a child again, as he begins new life after death.It's up to you whether you buy the idea that '2001' is some kind of secular-sacred allegory: maybe it's just a coincidence that Kubrick uses Ligeti's 'Lux Aeterna' so crucially throughout.  I like to see Hal the super-computer, ironicially, as a projection of the human soul, a receptacle of all those emotions airbrushed out in this perfect futuristic utopia, where everything is clean, and everyone speaks with polite, robotic articulacy.  He is, to adapt Robert Warshow, the No to this world's Yes - I am not the first to suggest he has more character than any human in the film.  Is Hal a genuine tragic hero, that common Kubrick figure, the man in control, in power, who spectacularly loses it?Anyone who prefers misanthropic Kubrick (as I did when younger) will find plenty of material too, especially in the spectacularly cynical prologue, where the Dawn of Man - a phrase conjuring Enlightenment visions of reason, craft, hunting, farming - is a sermon on man's grotesque nature, his base instincts of greed, fear, violence, schism etc.  The godhead monolith doesn't awaken a sense of humility or goodness, but a brutal, nihilistic hubris, a desire to conquer the unknown.  Kubrick's famous cut, from a bone to spaceship,  suggests the unlovely instincts we have watched are not so much ironed out in the bright new 21st century, as channelled, or refined.Of course, '2001' has the tendency to bring out the pseud in anyone who falls under its spell.  An important part of its mesmerising power, however, like all Kubrick, is its comedy, which is often deflating.  The bone of a dead animal becoming a fantastically elaborate spaceship might be a profound philosophical statement, but a spaceship that becomes the floating pen of a snoozing passenger, or the idea of gravity-defying lavatories, are surely bathetic.  It is no accident that Strauss' 'Also Sprachen Zarathustra', a piece that suggests the majestic, the otherworldly, the beyond, is replaced by 'The blue Danube', which somehow lacks the stature for space, suggesting more the idea of holiday, carnival, reflected in the spaceship that looks like a carnival ferris wheel.This is to suggest that Kubrick is always keeping things in balanced tension - cynicism/optimism; philosophy/comedy.  The Melville-like emphasis on process, on man ritually doing things slowly, in real-time; the idea that movements are patterned, obeying unthinking processes, suggests an ancient, more primal world or spirit beneath the futurism.Surely it's enough that '2001' is one of the cinema's most beautiful films, each dazzlingly, delicately choreographed camera movement slamming open a doorway in your mind, culminating in the gorgeous, ice-grey apartment of my dreams.",N/A

Many Hoffman's confront us through the screen: Hoffman the Fool, Hoffman the Revolutionary, Hoffman the Fugitive, Hoffman the want-to-be father, and Hoffman the Bipolar.We see the story through a series of recollections by Hoffman's friends and family, through the eyes of a journalist. &quot;Is Hoffman paranoid,&quot; he wonders as the movie begins--a question that never quite gets answered, even though the United States Government _was_ out to get him.In this biography, we also see an ugly dissection of governmental policies. We see oppression, suppression of dissent, blatant violation of rights, and the resilience of that oppressive system. Although many of the things Hoffman fought for were achieved, we still read of protesters beaten and gassed in Seattle and Los Angeles. The police still assault those who protest for non-mainstream causes. The System has not changed, only the faces of the activists. Although we're not drafting our boys and sending them to die in tropical jungles, we're helping third world governments to defoliate their forests in a &quot;War on Drugs&quot; that regularly claims innocent lives, both at home and abroad.After the farce of the 2000 elections, what would Abbie have done? He'd be there at each Bush appearance, playing the fool, pranking this pretender to the White House! Where is he now that we _really_ need him? Where is his successor?(If you'd like to dialogue about this movie or this review, click on the &quot;about me&quot; link above &amp; drop me an email. Thanks!)",N/A
372934,"If I could, I'd give this 3-1/2 stars, not just 3. Colin Firth, Ian Holm, Nicol Williamson, and Donald Pleasance, among others, make this film worth watching. History fans might enjoy the before and after synopses of the characters and the historical figures on whom they were based. Colin Firth fans will definitely appreciate his bed and bath scenes, although his acting abilities take everything up a notch. Still, with the gratuitous nudity, modern feel, and slim production values, this film can't aspire above B-movie status.The plot's a bit convoluted. The story is minimally narrated by Matthieu, the law clerk, yet he figures very little in it. Is the story about his boss--the advocate--or about the town? Maybe it's too ambitious in scope, what with its contrasting of country life and city life, interjections of witches, superstition, racism against Jews and gypsies, fornicating by the local clergy, secret societies of merchants, the Black Plague, unusual hunting prey, and sodomy. Oh, yes, then there's the trying of animals in court, a central theme that adds both humor and pathos to the proceedings and proves to be the unraveling of a dark and dirty secret hidden within the town walls. The ending's twist on the knight in shining armor is a good one.The film's worth a viewing for some fine performances and relatively interesting Medieval subject matter. Just don't expect it to be high brow.",The Advocate VHS
200750,"I was six when I first saw the original ""Jaws"" in the theatre, so I saw ""Jaws 2"" in its theatrical release at the far more mature age of nine.  At the time, I really liked this sequel more.  I don't feel this way now, but my reasoning wasn't bad for a pre-adolescent: the shark scenes are complicated and beautifully staged (especially the first attack on the catamarans), Roy Scheider's performance fleshes out even more depth of his character, and John Williams' score is a masterpiece....but of course it's not better than the original.A few thoughts: the original has always received all the accolades, and then all of the coverage (a la interviews, behind the scenes info, etc.).  I love all that this DVD has to offer: the documentary brings in Zanuck & Brown (not surprisingly, both very smart and articulate), Joe Alves, Carl Gottlieb, and director Jeannot Szwarc.  (I do wish that Scheider had participated.)  As a theatrical actor, director, and teacher of theatre, I couldn't get enough of all that those connected with the film offered.  Szwarc particularly impressed me; some have criticized his direction of the film as a Spielberg ..., but he demonstrates that he did his homework and made a film that was truly his own.  For example, I've never liked the fact that the film shows the shark in all its glory so early, but Szwarc explains why this was a deliberate choice.  (I still don't agree, but it's good to hear a smart director defend his choices.)Actor/director Keith Gordon also delivers a wonderful short film chronicling his experience with ""Jaws 2,"" and it is also not surprisingly excellent, full of great story-telling and humor.  (If you haven't seen ""The Chocolate War"" and ""A Midnight Clear,"" these are two superb independent films which he directed.)I do have a few complaints.  Is it me, or does the widescreen here look just slightly squashed from side-to side?  It looks like it needed some more black on the letterboxing to me...also, I don;t have home theatre, so I can't tell if the sound is as disappointing as some of these reviews have said.And finally, the one shot in the film that drives me crazy is the one that concludes the extraordinary sequence in which Mike is pulled on board the catamaran just as the shark propels by the boat.  Everything works until the shark opens its mouth, and the rubber or the shark's nose bends in a totally unnatural way.  Szwarc explains how difficult that shot was to get so we can forgive it...but it's always taken me out of the moment of suspense to see that, and I wish that he had said ""[darn] it, I wish the nose didn't do that.""Well, this is nit-picking, isn't it?  I definitely recommend this film -- and for me, the DVD is a winner.  Long live nine year-old film critics!",N/A

I can swear that he took all the cliche lines from Home Alone and stuck them in this movie.  The fighting sequences should have been better choreographed.  The Patricia Valesquez character was brutally betrayed by the film...it made no sense.  And is the cleavage supposed to distract from the bad dialogue?  Anyway...the special effects were eye candy.

81165,"Everyone kept telling me how great this film was and that I HAD to see it. But after seeing it I walked away thinking was that it. There is nothing more.  The film is very slow and drawn out, trying to make the small plot seem bigger. The script is so poor. The dialoge sounds written, it feels worked out. It rarely sounds natural. Which is a huge pity, because the idea is very interesting.  A lower class boy genius and only one man that can really seem to help him. There was so much room to develope and expand the idea. Yet it never really does so.  Robin Williams was brilliant, Matt Damon and Ben Affleck had moments of brilliance. Affleck moreso.  There are some moments where real emotion is shown and it draws us in. But the movie always seem to lose that connection. Not all the characters were expanded like they could have been.This movie is good, but it could have been great. A rent rather than buy.",Good Will Hunting
57951,"Good performances highlight this film. Jeff Chandler once again gives an excellent portrayal as the stoic, strong silent type as he upholds the law in this modern day western. Orson Welles turns in another convincing performance as the powerful rancher, a similar patriarchal role that he perfected in several of his latter films. Jeff Chandler was a rugged, virile leading man characterized by his steel gray wavy hair, high cheekbones and a muscular physique.  He starred in action films from the late 1940s into the early 60s, often as American Indians, hoodlums and cavalrymen. Not an obliging star, Chandler often rebelled against Universal's mediocre action projects he was often relegated to and was suspended on several occasions. Chandler deserved better roles than he was given in the likes of  ""SIGN OF THE PAGAN"" and ""YANKEE PASHA."" In his best roles Chandler was the introverted enigmatic and stoic leading man of high uncompromising character as this film demonstrates. This quality can also be seen in his performances in ""AWAY ALL BOATS,""  ""FOXFIRE,"" ""RAW WIND IN EDEN,"" ""THE JAYHAWKERS,"" ""RETURN TO PEYTON PLACE"" and ""MERRILL'S MARAUDERS.""

564747,"Okay, I probably liked watching CZJ more that I would have the real CTG, but surely there must be actresses who could have played the role better.  It's a shame we couldn't peel (sorry, I couldn't resist) a few decades off of Diana Rigg, or CZJ's co-star Jeanne Moreau, or better still, Francesca Annis. Get ""Lillie"" and watch Annis and a much better supporting cast (and direction and production) put CTG to shame (and they did it a quarter-century earlier) in a MUCH better costume show about a young woman who starts as an unsophisticated teen and conquers a man's world, royalty and all.  Annis is a lot more believable as she charms, beguiles, teases, scorns, tolerates, manipulates, and sometimes frostily discards kings, princes, artists, ministers, captains of commerce, seemingly whatever men she chooses -- all this without being a princess, czarina, or empress.  The boss ladies in ""I Claudius"" and Lindsay Duncan in ""Traffik"" likewise showed how it should be done.  The fake duchess in ""Hornblower"" and the perfect cast of ""Pride and Prejudice"" show that A & E can find great actresses now.  Why didn't they do it here?  For instance, the actress who played CTG's lady-in-waiting could probably have done a lot more with the lead role.The one star performance is by Jeanne Moreau as the aging / dying Empress Elizabeth.  Too bad she's gone before the movie's half over.  Ian Richardson is satisfactorily sly and slimy, but Omar Sharif helps prove that actors, like wines, do not all age well (sorry to say that about a fellow bridge freak).  The role of Potemkin could have been so much greater than the hardly believable boy-toy play it got.This movie is worth watching because it depicts highly significant times and events often ignored in the US as we focus on our late colonial and early revolutionary events occurring about the same time.  Also, for the guys, sure, CZJ is definitive delicious brunette yumminess (but Sophia was better), and we get lotsa good cleavage shots, but in a skin flick, I want more skin.",Catherine the Great VHS
521055,"In 2000 there were two movie released dealing with Earth's first human landing on Mars. The first one out of the starting gates was MISSION TO MARS. That movie was full of pretty pictures, but lacked any substance; contained an all-star cast, but no talent was displayed; and gave tribute to a classic film by one great director (Kubrick's 2001), but failed to display the talent of it's own director (DePalma). The other Mars movie of 2000 is RED PLANET. It is a much better film than MISSION TO MARS.The movie takes place in the not too distant future of mid-century 2000. The Earth is polluted and overpopulated and not only are fossil fuels running out, but so is oxygen. Algae has been deposited and growing on Mars so that if all else fails, life on Earth can be transported to the Red Planet. However, after years of depositing and growing the plants, oxygen levels on Mars drop off significantly and all traces of plant growth disappear. A team is assembled to travel to Mars to discover what has happened and bring back answers (and perhaps some hope) to Earth.Unlike MISSION TO MARS, RED PLANET doesn't take itself too seriously. It's a by-the-book Hollywood formula movie. The movie boasts a talented cast of supporting actors who must have enjoyed themselves while making the picture because their characters are believable (unlike those in MISSION). Also, the effects and scenery are just as beautiful as in MISSION (well the ship here isn't as detailed as in that movie, but that's a minor point).The only major flaw of the picture is that it fails to really engage the audience. Since this is a formula film and it takes place on Mars there isn't nothing new to see (well AMEE is pretty cool, but killer robot dogs aren't new either). The film has more substance than MISSION TO MARS, but it lacks the excitement of another 2000 space film, PITCH BLACK. Of course, that film contained some blood and guts, but it was much more exciting. RED PLANET doesn't have the rush of PITCH BLACK, but nevertheless is a nice piece of mind-candy movie to keep your mouth wet.",N/A

It's Dolby Stereo Surround this time, and the music is nicely enveloping. The picture, framed in the standard TV 4:3 ratio, is sharp enough to pass muster. The extra features, the usual bios of Christie and Suchet, are showing their age. A nice retrospective of Suchet's career as Poirot would seem to be in order eventually.All in all, a jolly good show for all concerned. One hopes other Poirots will be forthcoming.

680492,"I have a sort of love/hate relationship with Takeshi Kitano. I think he's got a HUGE ego, likes to put his own image on screen far too much, can overindulge in sentimentality, and occasionally offers filmic messages which border on being fascist. At  his worst, his films are extremely hostile towards people who look or behave outside the norm -- see the scene in FIREWORKS where, disguised as a cop, Takeshi pretends to shoot a long haired kid from his car window; it's EASY RIDER from the point of view of the rednecks in the pickup. He seems to advocate a shoot-first-ask-questions-later defense of the family, the home, etc., which seems to identify him with the more conservative or right-leaning aspects of Japanese society, which leaves me (and some more progressive Japanese) with misgivings about his work. His movies also are brutally violent -- there's a scene in BROTHER where my hands leapt to my face and I cried out involuntarily, which I just don't DO in movies.  All that said, I rather enjoyed this film. It's a relatively simple tale of loyalty and friendship among mobsters. Takeshi is a Yakuza who goes looking for his brother in LA, and ends up working with his brother's gang to take over drug distribution in their neighborhood, going to war with other gangs to do so. Some of the violence here doesn't seem to have much to do with the story -- there are scenes of finger-cuttings and hara-kiri that aren't really that justified in terms of the narrative -- and as I say, there is some very extreme brutality from time to time -- but if you don't mind violent cinema, are interested in the Yakuza, like gangster movies, or just like to watch smartly-made films, BROTHER is ultimately rewarding and enjoyable. It doesn't break much new ground, but it kept my interest up. The supporting cast, by the way, are quite good; Takeshi seems as able to direct in English as in Japanese. As far as I know, this is his first film since JOHNNY MNEMONIC (which he merely acted in) that has a substantially English-speaking cast....",N/A
237194,"The late saxophonist, Dexter Gordon, was absolutely fabulous in this film about an American jazz musician in Paris as the 1950s come to a close.  He befriends a young Frenchman who tries to help him but ultimately such friends will always be the givers in a relationship with a jazz artist.  There is dialogue in this movie that is always the first thing I remember about it.  Gordon's character wonders why people always expect that by escaping to somewhere else, that they will find a new life.  &quot;But you're still yourself when you land there,&quot; he adds, &quot;You'd have to be a different person inside if you wanted to escape into a new life.&quot;  These are prophetic words because although race-blind Paris will offer yet another jazz opportunity to this American black musician, he will never escape from himself. He ultimately sees a French psychiatrist when he can't stay away from booze and drugs.  &quot;I can't turn off the music in my head,&quot; he says, &quot;It is always playing.&quot;  Perhaps no truer words have ever been spoken by an artist because even those with smaller gifts in the fine arts see images or hear music in their heads.  They might be able to turn it off at times but a huge talent won't be able to do so.  As they say, there is no free lunch.

557448,"Alexander Nevsky is a lively pro-Soviet propaganda piece partially intended as a warning to Hitler at the time not to invade Russia.  The epic battle on the frozen lake is justly famous and the sheer scope of the logistics of filming are impressive.  Some of the characters are somewhat cliche stock creations of the time including the two soldiers fighting for the love of one woman who must prove themselves in battle, but overall it's a modest success.The real prize in this three film Criterion set however is of course Ivan the Terrible parts 1 and 2, a great masterpiece, Eisenstein's most &quot;enjoyable&quot; film(s) and indeed one of the oddest works to emerge from Soviet cinema of the time.  Highly expressionistic visuals combine with a melodramatic (and slightly revisionist) take of Ivan's life to create one of the stranger filmic experiences one will see.  Eisenstein clearly had a very highly developed visual style and the numerous extreme close-ups of faces are extraordinary as are the sets and costumes.  Part 2 doesn't quite live up to the promise of part 1 but nevertheless brings the characters to an appropriate conclusion.  Bizarrely humorous (perhaps unintentionally at times) Ivan is nevertheless a film more for afficionados than for the casual viewer looking for another classic in the mould of Casablanca.Regarding the transfers, they are superb and anyone expecting better prints is simply not being realistic regarding the age of the material and the conditions in which they were kept.  While not as pristine looking as other recent releases of 40's films on DVD such as Shadow of a Doubt or Monsieur Hulot's Holiday they are more than adequate considering given the circumstances.",Eisenstein: The Sound Years

82493,"Walt Disney's first full length feature, animated, and in color, is now regarded as a classic above criticism. Well, while it is a huge achievement, especially for 1937, it IS a little thin on story.Set in a European-esque fairytale world, Snow White is the pretty young Princess living under the shadow of her evil stepmother the Queen. Envious of her beauty she orders her huntsman to lead her out into the woods and cut her heart out. He gets the first bit right, but chickens out on the actual heart-cutting. Instead he banishes her to the woods where she promptly invades a private home, claiming it for herself, and enslaves the forest animals to do her bidding.When the rightful owners return they are first alarmed but then happy to have a woman living in the house to seize their passions and cook their dinners. I assume that all dishes served in Casa De Dwarf are all vegetarian since we never actually see Snowy kill, skin, and butcher the animals that she has enslaved.Eventually the Queen learns that Snowy is still alive and aims to kill her with a poisoned apple (that can be reversed by a kiss from her true love). Why she doesn't just slit her throat or burn the house down is beyond me.There are not really enough developments in the story to maintain the 83-minute running time, with a lot of space devoted to singing and rhythm-timed animation in the style of Silly Symphonies. But the animation, and especially the backgrounds, are wonderful to look at and really do create an atmospheric, beautiful world. It's a shame Disney didn't indulge in them more.Still a classic, but perhaps a little too quaint from a modern point-of-view.The Blu-ray presents the movie in a 1.34:1 1080p aspect ratio that is almost completely flawless and makes it look like it was drawn yesterday. There is an optional ""Disney-View"" feature that fills in the empty space left by the window-boxing with appropriate animated framing. It is not intrusive. There is not a single pop or hiss in the restored DTS HD-MA 7.1 sound either. A MASSIVE amount of extra features are included.",N/A

The final showdowns are always the best, but this one really shows how a final showdown should be done. If you're a fan of The Goonies and the Universal monsters, then check The Monster Squad out.",N/A
576305,"PANIC is another in a string of fine performances that have shown William H. Macy to be 'quietly' establishing himself as one of the best actors working today.  He delivers the line quoted above just moments after being confronted by his wife, Martha (Tracy Ullman), about possibly being involved in an affair.  It's a very telling line -- Macy gives it such an air of detached resignation -- it exemplifies the pivotal, life-changing crossroads at which Alex, his character, finds himself.  It's a decision that he has to make -- there is no way to avoid it -- but one that he dreads.  He is a man in a corner with no easy way out.A first directing and writing effort for Henry Bromell, PANIC is a well-composed and intelligent film.  The casting, acting, cinematography and music all combine to create a seeming oxymoron, a sort of 'relaxed tension' that builds as the story progresses.Alex is having a bit of a mid-life crisis -- he's a son dominated by a cold, controlling father (Donald Sutherland), dragged at an early age into following the old man's footsteps into the 'family business', which just happens to be murder-for-hire.  The only other person who knows what the business really involves is his mother (Barbara Bain) -- until the stress and unhappiness of his life bring him into the office of a psycholigist (John Ritter).  In the waiting room he meets fellow patient Sarah (Neve Campbell), a beautiful, troubled 23 year-old woman with issues of her own, to whom he becomes uncontrollably attracted.It is at this point that the viewer begins to realize that this film doesn't take the easy road.  In the hands of another writer or director, everything might become nauseatingly predictable -- but it the case of PANIC, the audience is treated to a more realistic, 'inside' look at a hit man, indeed, a hit man with a conscience.The DVD edition includes a few deleted scenes -- interesting, but just as well left out.  I would go so far as to say that any one of them being included in the finished product might have actually detracted from the overall effect of the film.  Clocking in at only 88 minutes, the film is leaner than many -- but that allows it to move along nicely, to the point, with the fat trimmed away.This film did well at festivals, but didn't fare as well with most critics (Roger Ebert raved about it, however) or in theatres.  Available now on DVD, it's one that viewers should take the opportunity to explore.",Panic

568565,"This is a project that should have been done when GB was in top form, conquering the world: the 70's. Unfortunately, it wasn't, resulting in nil 70's video output and this too-late show from 2000. It's not bad at all, and often very enjoyable, but if you're old enough to remember how this guy used to absolutely tear up the stage with his guitar pyrotechnics and incredibly soulful, soaring voice, this show might disappoint you. Age and a lot of touring/singing has taken its toll on his voice, but not to an intolerable degree. He tends to scream or slur off tough notes instead of hitting them melodiously like he used to, and his voice is raspy and harsh occasionally. He's had these tendencies as far back as the 80's though. The parts that are hardest to deal with are those on which he attempts to scat without his guitar - he just can't do it very well anymore. He needs the guitar in unison with his voice to keep him from getting silly. GB does have a quirky sense of humor, and you'll see it in this show (particularly when an older woman hops onstage and dances with him - his look of alarm is priceless!), but it doesn't serve him well when singing or scatting - it's at these moments when he seems to be just parodying himself.For this show, he was trying very hard to please, and it shows. He sometimes tries to do a little more vocally than he's capable of, but he can still do ANYTHING he wants to on guitar. The highlight in this respect is &quot;Danny Boy&quot;, a solo instrumental in which he emulates the sound of bagpipes on guitar. It's an amazing, virtuoso performance, reminiscent of his early days. When GB has a guitar in his hands, he's still a very dangerous man. But he spends half of the show guitar-free, as usual, which is mystifying considering his obsession with pleasing people.The biggest downer with the first half of show are the bland, lifeless arrangements and GB's need to get warmed up. The BBC Orchestra plays without any big band fire at all. I was really disappointed for a while; the songs seemed very slow in comparison to the album versions, and everyone seemed to be just going through the motions - zero inspiration. &quot;Beyond The Sea&quot;, for example, was pathetic, with GB's lousy vocal and the band playing as if they were in molasses. GB just doesn't work as a lead singer for a big band - he doesn't have the vocal firepower anymore. Then Joe Sample comes out for a few passionless songs from &quot;Absolute Benson&quot;. Those tunes (except for The Ghetto, which is good) are reminiscent of his &quot;Collaboration&quot; album; weak, aimless melodies in the Earl Klugh fashion, with the obligatory, bland solo spots. Same overproduced junk he's been doing since the 80's. Up to this point, halfway through, with the weak performances and frequent, weird costume changes (why does he feel the need to wear a hot, snazzy suit all the time?), it looked like hope was lost.However, GB finally turned up the heat by returning to his glory days: &quot;This Masquerade&quot;, &quot;Breezin&quot; (with a great arrangement that he obviously likes to improvise to), and many of his other hits are marvelously performed. This is where the crowd gets really pumped up and comes alive, as do GB, the band, and the viewer. He sings these songs more passionately than the rest. Again, when he picks up his guitar (and stops the silly dancing and mugging), his inspiration level increases and the music sometimes catches fire. Although, I wish he'd have gotten the old group back together for this gig: Ronnie Foster, Ralph MacDonald, Harvey Mason, Phil Upchurch. With those guys, he could actually improvise, instead of just being the &quot;star of the show&quot; and playing the hits with a generic backing group. His group was a major key to his greatest music, and the guys playing with him at this show are okay, but seem afraid to do anything but play the chord changes. These isn't much interaction between them and GB. At least the great Stanley Banks is still with him.The DVD quality is fine. The 5.1 sound is excellent and a blast to hear, although I thought the keyboards were mixed too low. George is WAY out front, but has sound great. The picture is good, high res, but a widescreen format for something like this puzzles me.I think it's safe to say GB's most creative musical days, and best singing, are behind him. But it's okay; people get older. His guitar skills are unaffected. This DVD is a good show, but sort of like hearing Sinatra in his later years. He's not what he used to be, and it takes a hell of a lot of effort to get back to (or near) that level on a song-per-song basis. I think GB can do better, but this is what was released, so I'll take what I'm given.",N/A

The film's plot isn't believeable if you were to describe it to someone but do that person a favor and lend the film to them. The film transports you into a world where a young artist sketches a portrait of a demure young girl and gains critical fame for his work only to realize that he needs his muse to maitain this new found level of brilliance. He searches for and finds her to only realize how she seems to have grown into an adult in a very short period of time, and he falls in love with this newly matured beauty.

Just watch the sparkle in Jones' eyes as she talk to Cotten about her parents when they meet for the first time in Central park. Cotten's character Eben Adams is intrigued by her but the events she describes have taken place years not days ago!! Is this woman real? Will their love endure? I won't give a hint more about the plot but the final scenes will have you crying so hard you can't see the action on screen. Jones was made for this role and Selznick knew it!

THe story, which centers around a 15 year old who writes for Rolling Stone, is very interesting, and even more intriguing when you know that this story is based on the Director's life. The music is way cool, and captures the era well. Francis McDormand is very outstanding as the know all mom who has to deal with her growing son. Billy Crudup is great as the guitarist/star of the ficticious band: Stillwater. The movie is worth the price itself, but the DVd contains many interesting extras like articles written by Cameron Crowe back when he was kid, that were published in Rolling Stone.

570294,"I've been a life long &quot;Governator&quot; fan, but I passed on seeing 'The 6th Day' in theatres. However, The 6th Day is a fairly decent movie along the lines of Total Recall. In fact, it is so similar to Total Recall that you might be experiencing Deja vu when you watch this movie.Its not a bad thing that its so similar to Total Recall...its nowhere near as good, but its an entertaining film dealing with the possible future issues of cloning. As usual with any Governator flick, Arnold has his classic grunts and groans and funny faces throughout the entire movie. Its never short on violent, over-the-top action, and the comedic element is present throughout the entire film. And the best part about it? Why, having double the Arnold of course! Using the ol' Hollywood duplicate trick, we get to watch two Arnolds cleaning house.If you're expecting a masterpiece you'll be sorely disappointed...its far from it. As I state in the title of this review, this is basically 'Total Recall: PG-13 Edition'. Robert Duvall has a small but good role in the film as well. Even in a cheesy movie, his acting ability shines through. Otherwise you will probably enjoy this film if you're an Arnold fan.

579526,I think this is the best of the series so far.  It is an excellent adaptation of the LT Hornblower book with the follow up written by Forrester (the letter of Admiral Hornblower telling the truth about what happened).  The movie develops ship board life more fully and we are made to live on board seeing how each of the different ratings actually lived as opposed to the more sanitised view of the Hornblower with Gregory Peck (which I liked as well but for different reasons)It is an excellent exploration of how damaging a command structure can be if all of the officers are not in sync.  Another excellent treatment of this topic is Damn the Defiant with Guiness as the Captain and Bogarde his First Lieutenant.As with Hornblower in general the plot is a bit to pat (Damn the Defiant is probably a better story)but that may be the result of the fact that I first read it more than 30 years ago so it holds no surprizes for me.I thought the battle scenes featuring the ships were nicely done...better than the first ones in the series.  They are now using ships appropriate to the time period.  (In the first of the series they were nice but looked like they should have been in the Seven Years War.)But I will admit to being a fan of the genre so I will buy anything having to do with wooden ships...this is certainly one I think any other fan should own.,Horatio Hornblower - The Adventure Continues
527621,"I thought this movie was pretty fun and completely fits in with Verhoeven's state of seeing things on film--however, the scene is which Bacon's character attacks the woman in her apartment was heavily cut for the theatres--which is kinda absurd because Verhoeven sees things through a lens perversely--so when I saw on the dvd that this scene was included on the dvd in the deleted scenes section, I was curious to see what the test audiences deemed too intense, but instead of showing the scene--the people who created this dvd thought it best to include maybe 30 seconds of it and keep Voehoeven's voice running over it.  This is a major disappointment citing that this is one reason we buy dvds, but also with a film that was as trashed as Hollow Man by critics, it would be best to include as much as possible to make ones already unsure about the movie want to buy the dvd.

524294,"&quot;Erin Brockovich&quot; is a wonderful movie! Starring Julia Roberts, Albert Finney, and Aaron Eckhart, it's based on the real-life story of Erin Brockovich, a down-on-her-luck, twice divorced former beauty queen with three young children. Having no post-high school education and few job skills, she has great difficulty finding and holding down a job. Despite her adversities, she displays a fierce grit and determination as she constantly seeks ways to support her family.Then a seemingly tragic twist of fate puts her on the road to a complete reversal of  luck. After being seriously injured in a car crash, she sues the doctor who hit her. Her antagonistic personality and foul mouth cause her to lose her lawsuit. With bluff and bravado, she persuades  her lawyer, Ed Masry, into giving her a job as a file clerk in his law firm.Erin finds herself intrigued by one of the cases contained in the files she's putting away. Why are people's medical records included in a simple real estate transaction? She asks Ed if she can look into it. He agrees.  What Erin finds horrifies her. A large electric utility near the small town of Hinkley has been dumping a highly toxic form of chromium into the water. Citizens in Hinkley are contracting various forms of cancer and other gravely debilitating diseases.The film's main story line tells of Erin and Ed's efforts to persuade Hinkley's citizens to join in a class action lawsuit against the utility.Julia Roberts, Albert Finney, and Aaron Echhart each  illuminate the screen with their superb performances.  In Roberts' case, it would be easy to focus on her good looks and skimpy wardrobe and slight her acting.  The fact is, though, her acting in this movie is probably her strongest attribute!  Throughout the film, Roberts' character comes off as completely natural, believable, and admirable - if not always likeable. Julia Roberts is certainly deserving of her 2001 Academy Award Best Actress award!Albert Finney (nominated for Best Spporting Actor) plays the gruff, irascible, hard-working, and totally decent lawyer Ed Masry. Finney's Oscar-worthy performance is certainly the equal of Roberts. The chemistry between Roberts, the star of modern-day female movie stars, and Finney, the grizzled veteran of stage and screen, sparkles.Aaron Eckhart' s portrayal of George, the biker-turned-boyfriend and live-in baby-sitter is a refreshing change from the typical - and expected - Harley-Davidson rider stereotype. As Eckhart depicts him, George is smart, tender-hearted, probably a bit lazy, possessed with a wanderlust he keeps under control, and a thoroughly decent fellow.How director Steven Soderbergh managed to keep &quot;Erin Brockovich&quot; from becoming another tedious, clich&eacute;-ridden legal and family drama is intriguing, and is probably one of the key reasons for the movie's tremendous popularity. It would have been easy to turn &quot;Erin Brockovich&quot; into a film filled with stereotypical courtroom pyrotechnics; long, idealistic speeches about the &quot;little guy&quot; versus corporate America; and characters that are either too easy to hate or too easy to love.That's pretty much what I expected when I began watching the movie. Instead, I witnessed a film filled with ordinary, decent people... people with faults, to be sure; but all living their lives as best they can. Instead of slick lawyers seeking victory at any cost, there are attorneys zealously representing their clients to the best of their abilities. Instead of hapless, pitiable victims of corporate greed, the townspeople of Hinkley are portrayed as caring, decent, law-abiding citizens whose only concern is the welfare of their families.What Soderbergh has, in fact, done is present to his audiences a wonderful reflection of American life - the good as well as the bad. At the conclusion of this wonderful film, it's easy for viewers to walk away feeling pretty good... not only about the ultimate outcome of the movie, but also about the fact that we Americans are, for the most part, decent, caring, law-abiding citizens. And that makes &quot;Erin Brockovich&quot; a film well worth seeing!",Erin Brockovich VHS

88584,"There are only a few words worthy enough to describe Elia Kazan's 1951 masterpiece.  The words are adjetives.  The first is Flawless, this would refer to the direction and cinematography that gives the film such an uncannily realistic quality.  Incredible is the next word I would use.  This word applies to the performances of Marlon Brando, Vivien Leigh, and all the actors who participated in this film.  It's dominance in the acting categories at the Oscars is testimony to this fact.  Each actor portrays a character so feasilbe, and so real, it's difficult not to get wrapped up in the film.  Reguardless of gender, you can relate and really feel for each character.  A Streetcar Named Desire is probably the first REAL movie, with realisic characters to come out of Hollywood at the time.  And the final word I would use to describe this film is timeless; all one would have to do is colorize it, and you'd never know the difference as far as time frame is concerned.  This is the definative movie that really examplifies what acting is, and should be.  It is the film that inspired me to become an actor myself.",A Streetcar Named Desire

When this came out it drove the leftist media absolutely nuts similar to the way Mel Gibson's brilliant Patriot drove them nuts more recently: kids with guns. Is a foreign takeover of the USA possible? I would say not, the movie's critics bash the notion of it, but the delicious irony of it all is the lefties are right, but because of the thing they hate the most - private ownership of firearms.  I loved the part when the soldiers ransacked the records of the sporting good stores looking for the gun sales records as a means of disarming any possible resistance.  The picture itself was a bit farfetched in some ways, but moving in others, and leaves every viewer with at least a few things to ponder ( at least the ones still capable of independant thought). In the long run, the actual nationality of the oppressors is not that important. Change the color of the uniforms if you must, the story and the message of resistance to tyranny stays the same.

534925,"&quot;Cast Away&quot; is one of those all-too rare, brilliant films that is perfectly structured, perfectly conceived, and perfectly acted. In many ways, it is like a three act play, or three short movies. The first act introduces the main character and shows his life up until his being stranded on a desert island. The second act, the major bulk of the film, is a tour de force, one man character piece about the struggles to survive all by oneself.  To craft a film in which most of the action involves one actor by himself for around an hour or more of screen time, and make it absorbing, insightful, and never boring is an amazing achievement, one which can be attributed to the great direction of Robert Zemeckis and the wonderful performance by Tom Hanks, who manages to make his character both an everyman and three-dimensional, living, breathing person. It is in this second act that we really learn about this man. By seeing every creature comfort he has grown up with instantly snatched away from him, and watching a modern man have to utilize talents of survival he didn't even know he had, we the audience are rewarded with the experience of seeing a character closer than usually happens in film. The third act is the resolution: what happens when this man who has had to live a primitive lifestyle, returns to the modern world. The amazing thing is, not much has changed in terms of technology or so forth (therefore it is not a Rip Van Winkle type tale). Instead, he has changed. Watch this movie for one of the most fascinating character portrayals in recent film history,and for the great performance by Tom Hanks. Rarely does a movie so brilliantly set up a life for a character, take it away from him in a flash, thus forcing him to create a new life for himself, and then see the results when he is returned to the old one, forever now a changed man. Notice that the title is not &quot;Castaway,&quot; the noun, but the verb &quot;cast away,&quot; giving the movie much richer, symbolic levels of meaning than what the former would have been.",N/A

446648,"Comedy has always been a strange facet of human entertainment: a method in which the flaws of one's self - or the follies of mankind in general - are exposed and subsequently reduced by a knowing chuckle; the pain and suffering of miscommunication transformed into a cathartic moment of release.  Just as laughter is essential to the health and constitution, comedy can be an essential vehicle to gain insight into misfortune, to understand and perhaps overcome those same redundancies/patterns which plague the waking life.Turn on the boob-tube on any given ""prime-time"" night and the options for said release are near limitless: a thousand and one situational comedies vying for your attention (and commercial dollar, of course).  But are any really worth the time spent? Given the plethora of recycled motifs - unresolved sexual tension, slapstick excess, emotional estrangement, miscommunication in extremity - do any of these time-worn human-flaw laugh-triggers produce more than a hollow snicker? It really depends on the quality of the script and the dedication of the actors, the competency of the men behind the camera and the synergy of the crew as a whole to produce something fresh and uniquely expressive from human angst.  Few comedies, in my opinion, succeed in this regard: year after year, the bulk of Hollywood output is a case of diminishing returns.  But then again, Los Angeles is not quite the cultural center is pretends to be, now is it?In the late 1970's, John Cleese of Monty Python fame assembled a crack team of artists for an interesting variation on the situational comedy theme.  Based around the neurotic, perpetually grumpy hotel owner Basil Fawlty (played by Cleese), _Fawlty Towers_ is a heady blend of slapstick, misinterpretation and emotional overload, with impeccable timing and flat-out brilliant dialogue.  Comedy rarely gets better than this.The episodes:The Builders - Basil's ""need for the cheap"" comes on strong when the hotel needs repairs.  Naturally he goes for the lowest bidder for the job, behind his wife Sybil's back no less, with disastrous hijinks as a result.The Wedding Party - The Heat is in the air one summer night, and Basil, guardian of British upper-crust morals, seeks to put a lid on the brimming sexual tension run rampant in the hotel...only to get caught in several compromising positions himself.The Psychiatrist - When a psychiatrist comes to stay at Fawlty Towers, Basil goes out of his way to avoid the good doctor, subconsciously aware of his own unsteady sanity... all the while exposing his deepest anxieties and inconsistencies as he seeks to evict a (hilariously portrayed) debonair guest for ""loose conduct.""Hotel Inspectors - Basil Fawlty has a low tolerance for tourists of any kind.  After an extreme bout of rudeness to a pretentious guest, Basil bends over backwards trying to make amends with what he thinks is a hotel inspector...and, upon discovering his error, will do anything to enact revenge upon the poor individual.The Germans - After a slight concussion, Basil acts crazier than ever, and his unfortunate German guests must bear the brunt for some deep-seated post-war resentments.A Touch of Class - One of my favorites.  Basil Fawlty is the consummate snob, spitting poison at the `lower class' guests while fawning all over those with the slightest title and/or bearing.  But what happens when his snobbery is taken for a ride by a confidence trickster? Many laughs, I assure you...Gourmet Night - Fawlty Towers' first Gourmet Night seems to have everything going for it: a professional chef, the cream of Torque society, an eager Basil to genuflect and bootlick...yet events to not proceed as planned...Waldorf Salad - An obnoxious American guest stops by Fawlty Towers, receives an eyeful of Basil's inconsistent managing style, and proceeds to ""lay it on the line"" with the gangly Brit.The Kipper and the Corpse - a guest dies in his sleep and Basil runs himself (and the rest of the staff) ragged trying to conceal it from the other guests.  Probably the best tension-building episode of them all.Communication Problems - Mrs. Hinderson is deaf and doesn't use her hearing aide because `it runs the batteries down.'  She and Basil are like oil and water, with a flame about to touch down...The Anniversary - In his typical cruel fashion, Basil pretends to forget his anniversary with Sybil, all the while planning an elaborate surprise party.

540456,"I've always had a personal connection avec the original JP...it came out and one of the happiest times of my life; perhaps that's why I've projected that it was a great movie. Certainly it holds a technique that the sequal and this third installment lack: incessant suspense. Yes, there were some suspensful intentions, but many never followed through. Perhaps the fact that it is a mere 92 minutes as compared to the first two which were two hours+. This film also lacks the majestic qualities and the inspiration of awe, the feeling that you were taking in something new and unique just as the charcacters in the movie were and the inability to comprehend the situations put forth before them. It seems that JP2 and 3 have a fatal flaw (predictability and casualness).Mind you, I certainly enjoyed the action sequences. I'd go as far to say that they are certainly braver than the originals. You can tell Spielberg did not direct this movie. It is not overly sentimental. Instead it harbors a darker flavor and it works well.It's a shame that the movie has a tendency to drop dead with banal dialogue. There's a speech delivered with William H. Macy about the joys of fishing trips with his ex-wife, Tea Leonie. Yes, that's right. Ex-wife. Yes, you've seen Twister and you've seen the Parent Trap so you know the formula. Happily, we care so little about the characters (though I should note that they are wonderfully acted by a quasi-all star cast) that wether they live or die is not an issue. We care more about the action and adventure. The action and adventure sequences are so top notch that we are left wanting much more. But they've followed Hollywood's ONLY pertinant Golden Rule: Leave your audience wanting more. Unfortunatly, you should have some sort of conclusion before abruptly ending the film with no catharsis.Jurassic Park is not something I would consider a movie, I would consider it an object. It is not pretentious, it does not masquerade as art. It is a movie that you can go and enjoy without having to get involved with characters. As opposed to other knock 'em out formula films, JP films always always succeeds in entertaing you no matter how thin the plots are. I definatly reccomend this film. It is a perfect summer movie. By all means, hang disbelief at the door, sit down with you popcorn and enjoy seeing a Spinosaurus (or Tricephlaplotz as William H. Macy calls it) eat an airplane.",Jurassic Park III VHS
219287,"The Greatest Show on Earth won the Academy Award in 1952 and watching it now that seems quite hard to believe.  This movie has not aged well and does not show off Cecil DeMille's skills that were so much more in evidence early in his career.  The circus parade scenes seem quite unfocused (and endless) although there are some film work in the behind the scenes shots and of the circus performers in action that maintain some interest.  The audience watching the circus seems alternately bored and excited (including a delightful cameo by Bob Hope and Bing Crosby during Dorothy Lamour's tacky song solo) and the audience watching the film would probably tend to agree with them.  Charlton Heston gives possibly his worst performance, delivering lines only slightly less woodenly than your average porn star.  Betty Hutton is saddled with playing a lady when her strength was always in playing the broad.  Without the brass, she becomes quite generic.  Cornel Wilde, by showing a little flesh, and James Stewart, by showing a little understatement, come off well.  The acting kudos of the picture, though, belong to Gloria Grahame.  She plays her usual tart with a heart of gold but manages, often, to feel like the only flesh and blood human among all the sawdust.  This overlong, dated work has small moments of pleasure and a wonderful train crash but has deservedly lost its place in the pantheon of epic movies.",N/A

The script translations were very faithful, the voices were good, and the overall story was just plain enjoyable.The film is pretty much showing what happened to Mewtwo and everyone else after the first film &quot;Mewtwo Strikes Back&quot;, and how in the end, everyone's memory from the battle was erased.  If anyone had watched the dubbed version of MSB like I did, you'll notice that the dubbed musical soundtrack makes its way back in the TV Special.A lot of the original music does make its way in, however, during the silent scenes of the original version, the score in the dubbed version of MSB was placed in this special as well.  The music isn't bad, however, the cues were done rather poorly, and some of the songs were repeated a few times.  Where they cut in and cut out didn't sound too well overall, and this was my only beef with this.Some scenes are quite violent, however they are not as violent as the first movie.  Still, some of the younger children in the audience may not be too comfortable with some of the scenes, and the older fans of the show may rejoice that no actual footage of this TV special was lost.And of course, it's not Pok&eacute;mon if there's no moral to the story, and this story has a very good one.

486583,"Thematically rich film even though it has trouble juggling everything smoothly.  Tucci never really prioritizes his themes and as a result, the profoundness of the &quot;secret&quot; is obscured.  I was still won over however because, well, because these topics are just not given enough attention in mainstream films.  On the surface, it appears that Tucci is examining the tumultuous relationship between the two Joes, but the real subject is the equally chaotic relationship between artists and their artistic endeavours.  Tucci examines how artists endure much suffering for their work and as a result, they tread a fine line between genius and madness.  He also seems to be saying that if the artistic impulse is not reined in, it can potentially become destructive because the truth that artists feel compelled to convey is much too complex and diverse to be expressed merely by the simple tools at the artists' disposal.  In fact, Gould's oral history reminded me of the director's rushes at the end of Assayas' &quot;Irma Vep&quot; -- an unrestrained vision gone haywire, short circuited by the futile attempt to express grand and divine ideas in a conventional format.  Tucci touches upon other themes as well, such as the difference between patronage and commercialism, the root of artistic inspiration, the responsibility of journalists for their subjects, etc. but they do not really go anywhere.  When the &quot;secret&quot; is revealed, in a most nonchalant manner, by the closing captions of the film (the &quot;secret&quot; is actually multi-layered -- there is another &quot;secret&quot; on the story surface, readily apparent just from the plot), a chill went down my spine.  Consequently, it made me re-examine the whole story and although &quot;Joe Gould's Secret&quot; is a good story, it isn't the main story nor the most compelling one, or otherwise the film would have been called &quot;Joe Mitchell's Secret&quot;.  It's puzzling why Tucci approached the story the way he did, but this movie is still a winner, and it's nice to finally watch a film that is bloated with ideas.  The detailed set-pieces of New York in the '40s are also a treat to look at.  Ian Holm gives the performance that is conspicuously remarkable, but it's Stanley Tucci's performance, which is nearly invisible next to Holm's, that becomes more noteworthy upon reflection, particularly after pondering the meaning of the film's closing captions.",N/A

Dressed to Kill first aired on cable back in 1981, and I only remember some of the racier scenes with Dickinson in various forms of undress in a shower, a taxi cab, a bed, and an elevator. When I finally sat through the whole film, I was impressed by De Palma's direction, with his Hitchcockian style, but also the clever twists which keep the viewer guessing right up to the end.

575211,"""Postcards From The Edge"" is by all means an autobiographical account of a very chaotic period in actress Carrie Fisher's life.  Her inspirations for her debut novel (originally published in October of '89) were her personal experiences in a drug rehabilitation center surmounting a cocaine habit, the relationship between she and her screen-veteran mother Debbie Reynolds and, generally, her wry perspective of life itself.  However, instead of sharing her mordant musings as the main character, Fisher created her counterpart in a character named Suzanne Vale (Streep).  Vale is a rising talent in the film industry with - surprise - an addiction to cocaine.  She has other indulgences as well and one day pops pills until the inevitable occurs - she is rushed to Cedars Sinai emergency room to have her stomach pumped.  Upon her near-death experience, she is committed to rehab and makes a deal with her director Lowell Kershak (Hackman): stay sober, get paid.  Of course, this is a grueling period not only because Suzanne is trying to curb her addiction but also because part of the deal involves living with her mother Doris Mann (MacLaine), an aging starlet who is eccentric, overburdening and an occasional alcoholic.Meryl Streep said while reading Fisher's acerbic but earnest screenplay that she immediately fell in love with the story from a single line uttered by her character during her struggle with sobriety: ""I know my life is good - I just can't feel it."" Streep undertakes one of her more complex roles; using Fisher's insight on the driving force behind drug dependence and building from her own interpretation, she portrays Suzanne as a conflicted but staunch individual struggling to gain a sense of authority over her own life.  Although the role of Suzanne called for a serious dramatic depiction, Fisher's dry humor and Streep's impeccable comedic timing make her conflict frivolous and fun to watch.  Director Mike Nichols (Regarding Henry, Working Girl, Biloxi Blues) had brought out the best in Streep before - she earned an Academy Award nomination in his 1983 film ""Silkwood"" as the title character.  He proved once again to be her good luck charm when Streep caught the Academy's attention for the ninth time, earning her seventh nomination for Best Actress.Nichols also enlisted Shirley MacLaine as Doris Mann, Vale's brazen mother.  She had already been intimately acquainted with the role of an oppressive parent, winning an Oscar for her endearing performance as Aurora Greenway in ""Terms Of Endearment"".  This bawdy, russet-tressed thespian has a long resume; although she has portrayed many a character, she gives Doris a much-needed spark combated by a unique sensitivity, making her performance a markedly impressive one.  This is a sorely underrated role, overshadowed by critically acclaimed performances of her past.Gene Hackman and Dennis Quaid make for entertaining supporting roles as Jack Faulkner and Lowell Kershak, respectively.  Quaid is adept at playing the smug spinster and therefore makes his character easy to despise.  Hackman, a refined player with credits like ""Target"", ""Mississippi Burning"" and ""The Firm"" plays a hard-edged but sympathetic film director who is willing to forgive and forget, knowing that Suzanne has so much more to offer to the film industry.Both MacLaine and Streep get a chance to boast their musical theater skills - Shirley sings a lively rendition of ""I'm Still Here"", a song by Stephen Sondheim that the man himself amended with personalized lyrics especially for her.  Streep sings the languid Ray Charles classic ""You Don't Know Me"" and at the very end of the film belts a country-western tune ""I'm Checking Out"" written by Shel Silverstein with little-known Canadian rockers Blue Rodeo in accompaniment.When Fisher was asked to write the screenplay for her novel, the producers wanted the film to focus more intimately upon Vale's relationship with her mother, even though much of the content of her book dealt with her tenure in rehab. Fisher didn't mind the change but much of the facts were slightly exaggerated not only for the drama but the comedy as well.  People will find this out as well as several other factoids while listening to Fisher's gravelly voiceover during the commentary mode.  It's almost as if one is sitting in the very room with Fisher while watching the movie, cracking odd jokes and having a drink or two.  Her dry wit is unique and distinctive, making it easy for the audience to realize and identify with the overall philosophy of the film.On the whole, ""Postcards From The Edge"" is an endearing portrait of the impenetrable bond between mother and daughter and, coming from Fisher's point-of-view, a quirky and poignant portrait indeed.",N/A

125918,"*Braveheart*  must be an influential, if not exactly good, movie:  witness its many imitators  (*Gladiator*, even Gibson's own  *Patriot*).  For the handful who haven't seen it, it chronicles the mythic tale of William Wallace, a Scottish commoner who in the early 14th century successfully engineered a movement for independence from England.  (Well, it was really Robert I who engineered it, but in this movie the Bruce is ineffectual, to put it kindly.  You see, Gibson is portraying WALLACE.)  I'm not going to sit here and bash the film; there are so many others that are more worthy of my disdain.  Let it be said that  *Braveheart*  will remind you of those old Hollywood epics featuring a cast of thousands.  The point being, the script and characterization are just as hackneyed as any DeMille movie.  (Or any movie from the 1930's starring Errol Flynn.)  There's a Milady in the form of a French Princess of Wales.  There's a wicked King.  The characters are either all Bad or all Good, and never mind the attempt at ambiguousness e.g. Robert the Bruce.  (He's all Good.)  There's the time-honored tradition, old as Seneca, of our hero's blending of personal revenge and patriotism as motivation to fight the injustices of the wicked King.  And there's Wallace himself, who seems to be a conflation of several cliched types  (Robin Hood, The Man With No Name, Charles Bronson in those  *Death Wish*  movies, etc. etc.).  Your toleration of this movie will depend on how willing you are to tread very, very familiar paths.As for Mr. Gibson's direction, it's no big deal.  Static compositions; close-ups intended to convey Meaning  (my favorite was the one where he's atop some mountain, the aerial camera delicately swooping around his tragic face); wistful scenery shots; and an excessive use of slow-motion.  In his defense, it must be stated that his battle scenes are really rather well done, inviting unsuccessful imitation  (think  *Gladiator* -- pee-yew!).  Mr. Gibson provides us three hours of all this -- his sophomoric direction, as well as his apparently sado-masochistic tendencies  (Wallace is constantly beat up throughout).  Some will find it worthwhile; some not.  I guess I'm with the latter group.",N/A

Maybe it's the effect of being fed up on weak movies packed with CGIs (like Tomb Rider, Cats&amp;Dogs, Final Fantasy etc), but the F&amp;F had somewhat refreshing effect on me. Let's leave the threadbare plot aside, for its just being there to bring the main characters together; and by the end it becomes so lame that it is not important any more who and why was stealing those trucks, as well as how on Earth P. Walker's character would face the ramifications of his generous actions a cop undercover would never perform. Oh, never mind... However, the movie is pulled out by the V. Diesel and P. Walker duo, the first being so eye-strikingly young and handsome it's unthinkable to sent him undercover ANYWHERE. V. Diesel, despite his pitbull face expressions, excersises the unmistaking magnetism of a &quot;bad guy&quot; who actually is a &quot;misunderstood good guy&quot; with a &quot;history&quot;. These two dudes do have some chemistry together, and it's not only for you, girls, to notice that.

422114,"Besides particular types of fashion, music, and television, the 1980s also contained its own unique movies. In a typical 80's movie (whether it be comedy, action, or drama) there is the roguish, dashing young man who is the film's hero. The hero is down on his luck, is in trouble with his girl, and is forced (usually out of necessity) into the most dangerous mission of his life. The hero has become an anti-hero and he hates it. He sees no way out but to do what he does best. However, something bad happens and the hero finds himself in a jam where he can't save himself. Ironically, he has to rely on a bumbling fool to come to his rescue. In doing so, the fool rises above himself, becoming a hero in the process. The plot is as old as time and Shakespeare used it over and over. Nevertheless, it wasn't until the 1980s that American moviemakers really delved into this age-old concept.In this regards, INNERSPACE is a typical 80's movie. You have the fallen hero (Dennis Quaid), his estranged love (Meg Ryan), and the fool that saves them both (Martin Short). There is also the usual dash of bad 80's clothing and techno rhythms. However, INNERSPACE is not a typical 80's movie. Much of the plot is taken from the sci-fi classic, THE FANTASTIC VOYAGE. However, INNERSPACE takes the idea from that movie to a whole new level.  Not only that, but INNERSPACE is an action-comedy, with a little bit a romance tied it.

The film clearly operates on a three act structure. As many of you readers already would have read chunks of the story, I won't repeat it here. The first act is really good but weak on some levels, glimpses are seen of a film director at his best with his creation. Some touches are brilliant and we can't wait to get more.

I immediately dismissed it as &quot;a piece of crock&quot; the ending just ruined it all. But i kept hearing two stories..one camp stating my views, and the other one proclaiming a film at its best.This intrigued me quite a bit, I certainly saw some magical touches with the music, the cinematography, sets and atmosphere which was very dominant and very classically executed shots but uh uh nope..bad movie.I thought to give it another chance and oh boy this one is quite a thinker or a puzzle,and dont get me wrong , I like smart movies but am still trying to get this one. I purchased the DVD for cheap and saw it again. Yup, same good stuff I saw before but the ending really made me think. I still havent come to a conclusion. I might be an idiot or a smarty for buying this one. But this film really has something going for it, Im very sure of it so you should give this one a chance, even if its a letdown, just be sure to put your thinking hat on and watch this one very very carefully.As for the DVD, this is one of the best video transfers I have ever seen, Artisan has done an excellent job. It has to be seen to be believed how the colors come out, no hints of grain or any scratches, the blacks are perfect and the hues are brilliant. Very little chroma key effects are seen in some scenes but these are few. The sound is your standard 5.1 dolby digital with an aggressive mix. no complaints there and the extras are neat..The commentary by Polanski is entertaining and oh for heaven sakes i wished he explained the end but no...the dude left it to us. maybe it makes movie watching more exciting he thought. :)give this one a go..see what you think but dont dismiss it too easily like nearly everyone else did.",The Ninth Gate

86033,"Stanley Kubrick, in this film, apparently deals with two problems by cutting the film in two separate parts, and yet he only deals with one problem that goes beyond the two parts and reunifies the film. In the first part he gives us a precise, accurate and nearly sickening description of the training of a Marine in the US. This training has to do with brainwashing, physical training and ideological conditioning. The objective is not to produce robots, but Marines who are so well conditioned that killing is their first reflex in a war situation.  Born to kill  as they say. This first part leads to a drama because in the mass of new recruits, there is, not a rotten apple, but one who cannot stand the brainwashing, because he cannot erase some of his old psychological attachments. His unconscuious reacts against the brainwashing and turns the brainwashing against the trainer and against the owner of this unconscious : to kill becomes to settle accounts (in vengeance) and to commit suicide. In the second part,  Kubrick gives us a vision of the Tet offensive in 1968, hence of the dramatic turning point of the Vietnam War that will eventually mean the American defeat. There we find again some of the characters of the first part and a few others and Kubrick describes how the killing instinct of these Marines has become the only survival strategy they have. They can survive and even remain sane because they kill, blindly and without thinking. Kubrick even goes further by showing that this leads to deranged personalities. One case is only quoted, but the main hero is confronted, right at the end, no longer with the blind reflex, but with the necessity to kill in order to respect some deep belief he has (suffering is not justified on a moral level) and the necessity to kill willingly, out of a conscious resolution. This leads to two possibilities : either the Marine is an animal and he will let the wounded person die, hence suffer, thus showing that he has no more moral values, or he will kill just as if it were an ordinary and simple action like drinking, eating or anything else, thus showing that he has no more moral values, no sense of perspective. And that's where the film gets its unity : either the Marine has become a robot for whom killing is as simple as breathing, or the conditioning is in contradiction with ethical values, making the reflex difficult if not impossible. Killing becomes then a regressive attitude and the film can end up on Disneyland famous song : M.I.C.K.E.Y.M.O.U.S.E. And this last image of Marines coming back from their exterminating mission for the night and singing that song, shows how deep war can make people sink. The last scene is poignant and revealing. A masterpiece. Dr Jacques COULARDEAU, Paris Universities II and IX.",N/A

With Lectors help, Starling gets closer to cathing Bob. Lector also gets deep in Starling's psyche, seeing that her father died when she was a child.

441325,"I recently purchased this movie, and after viewing it I got mixed feelings about it. The plot is exeptional and has alot to offer. Dracula and his loyal band of high society devil worshipers have developed a mutant form of the dreaded Bubonic Plague. This virus can spread from one person to another by touch, thus all of mankind can become infected in a matter of months. In doing this, Dracula will end his life and get the &quot;last laugh&quot; on humankind. Definitely fast paced, and very suspensful, this film benefits from Cushing's excellent performance. This isn't Lee's best work, but he does get the job done. Putting Dracula in the 70's was a major mistake. Dracula needs the moody, dark, and gothic ambience of the 19th century to be truly effective. Thanks to Lee's performance, the character manages to be effective enough to satisfy the audience. The one thing that REALLY ruins this film is the dreadful music. It is so James Bond, and it doesn't belong in a Dracula movie. Period. If Dracula wasn't present, I'd swear this was a Hammer James Bond movie. The plot teeters dangerously close to the realm of camp, but a good cast and excellent performances do make this film worth watching over and over. All in all, a fitting end to an excpetional saga. It's great to see Lee pitted against Cushing. They are the dynamic duo of Hammer horror. If you have seen the other Hammer Draculas, don't skip this one. It's reasonably good entertainment and provides an exiting firey finish to the Hammer Dracula saga.",N/A

368327,"AKIRA is the benchmark Japanese animated film, instilling an intelligence and uncharacteristic adult element into the false world of cell animation. The results are breathtaking. Each bit of trash, each shard of glass, each drop of sweat is amazingly animated, giving AKIRA a highly realistic, yet fantastical, look and feel. Set in post-World War 3 Tokyo, AKIRA tells the story of two boyhood friends who become entangled in a government experiment to harness the power of the human lifeforce, an attempt to speed up the human evolution. One of these friends, a young and mistreated boy named Tetsuo, finds himself the unwilling guinea pig in these experiments. He developes strong telekinetic powers and sets out to seek revenge upon those who have put him down and made him feel inferior. All this strong emotional material is set against a chaotic backdrop of a city in the midst of revolution. Protests and terriorist bombings sparks the streets, sidewalk preachers scream out their gospel, all while the government and the army fight to keep control. It's strong stuff, aimed at adults, with oodles of violence and true, thought-provoking questions. The ending is a bit convoluted for most, highly reminescent of Stanley Kubrick's 2001, but nothing can quite ruin the 100 minutes that preceed it. What transpires is a work of art that is extremely fascinating and genuinely exciting. This is a startling example of the power of animation and deserves to be viewed as a true film and not just a cartoon. But this is for thinking audiences only. DOn't expect any talking bunnies. Do expect a massive adrenaline rush.",Akira VHS

The true story of a nun who went from Belgium to the Billboards is told through this film, and it is to be enjoyed by adults and children alike.Debbie Reynolds is the sunny young nun Sister Anne, who comes to a convent in Belgium to begin her religious life, and hopes to one day continue her work in the Congo. With her guitar, &quot;Sister Adelle&quot;, and her beautiful singing voice, Sister Anne's talent is quickly recognized by the warm Mother Superior (Greer Garson) and the enthusiastic Father Clementi (Ricardo Montalban). She is encouraged by an old friend, Robert Gerarde (Chad Everett) to record an album of her hymns. The album becomes a sensation, and &quot;The Singing Nun&quot; is soon making appearances at parties and engagements, even appearing on &quot;Ed Sullivan&quot;! At first, Sister Anne is able to take her success in stride, as she begins teaching young children and forming a friendship with one of the underprivileged children, Dominic. But as the film progresses, Sister Anne finds herself torn: Should she continue her singing, or devote herself to God?One critic wrote that the film had &quot;the warmth and poignancy of a child's first prayer.&quot; And &quot;The Singing Nun&quot; is truly, that touching.

This movie chronicles a group of friends who go together to the front to fight.  This is a tough bunch of guys, but they never lose their humanity, like most of the nazi soldiers did.  The Soviet forces were lacking leadership due to the fact that Stalin had decimated their ranks in one of his insane paranoid murderous purges.  This is the war that convinced Hitler that the Soviets would crumble when his army attacked them.  The film does have a kind of washed out, grainy look, a little more than Saving Private Ryan did, but that didn't detract from the movie.  It kind of emphasized the bleakness those men were facing.  This movie has great battle action sequences, and I'll bet if there were environmentalists on the set, they'd have all had heart attacks because of the number of trees that were destroyed by tanks and artillary.  This movie isn't hampered by contrived plots, like SPR, or unnecessary love triangles, like what is in Enemy at the Gates (which is a good movie in every other respect).

In addition to the crackling script and sharp direction, the look and sound of &quot;Do the Right Thing&quot; is near perfect.

AI fails in that regard throughout: all dialogue is surface, &quot;on the nose,&quot; as Hollywood calls it. One-dimensional dialogue.

Ah, as with most successful failures, the script was the main failing.  The story follows 4 storylines, and Soderbergh pulls an Altman, and coherently intertwines them, a mammoth task to say the least.  The first story follows the newly appointed drug czar played by Michael Douglas.  His daughter played brilliantly by Erika Christensen, is smoking crack cocaine with her friends.  Supposedly this plotline is to be ironic, no, it's extremely heavy-handed, with no reason given for her drug habit, she is just a plot device.  Peer pressure may be a reason for alcohol, but she is smoking crack, she has to have problems.  The second plotline involves a mexican drug officer played absolutely flawlessly by Benicio Del Toro, no words can completely describe his performance.  This story is by far, the most compelling and coincidently, involves no heavy-handed tactics on the part of soderbergh or the the writer to get an emotional response from the audience.  The third plotline involves Don Cheadle and Luis Guzman and their attempts to bring down a local drug dealer.  Their performances are great also, they play off each other, with often funny results.  This story gets the least time.  The last plotline involves Catherine Zeta-Jones.  This is by far the worst story of the lot.  Catherine never could act, and giving her a role like this, is playing with fire.  And soderbergh got burned and burned badly.  When her drug dealer husband is arrested, she must pay back a cartel back a lot of money.  The sheer speed with which she becomes a ruthless adversary is completely preposterous.  She is ordering assassinations, and arguing with the leaders of high-powered cartels, literally within days of her husbands arrest.  This is completely ridiculous, she would be completely out of her league.  I don't care how tough you are, I don't think anything can prepare anybody to deal with drug cartels head on.  The multiple emotional layers of the character are never shown either, because, as I stated earlier, Catherine is without talent.  This movie was doomed from the beginning, Hollywood remaking a documentary into a movie, is just wrong.  They were obviously going to put some schmaltz in there, when the material doesn't support it at all.  The little coincidental meetings and when they pass in the street is just stupid too.  It isn't needed, and just distracts.  The performances will uniformly excellent, except for Catherine and the direction was impeccable.

540714,"Jurassic Park was a movie that astounded millions with its original plot, groundbreaking special effects and heart-pounding screenplay.  The Lost World broke that mold with unrealistic acting and a poor excuse to return to Jurassic Park.  This, the third installment in the Jurassic Park series, does much better than Lost World, but fails to bring back the same feel of the original.To start out with, the film is far too predictable.  Of COURSE ***SPOILER*** Billy took the eggs, Of COURSE Billy wasn't really dead. ***END SPOILER***  These things were far too easy to call in the course of the movie.The scares are sometimes predictable (raptor in glass tube) but are mostly genuine.  All in all, they're fun.The acting is superb on the part of William H. Macy, T`ea Leoni, and Sam Neill.  Trevor Morgan seems plastic at times, but generally, plays a brave lost boy genuinely.  Of course its good to see Alan Grant back, and apparently the cast thinks so as well, as they all seem to flock to him constantly throughout the flick.See this movie if you liked Jurassic Park.  It's a fun action movie with maybe too many prequel references and predictable suprises, but its the second sequel in an action genre- what do you expect?",Jurassic Park III VHS

Later on you try and see if there were any slips and that's where the DVD will offer endless hours of fun to the hyper critical.,Memento VHS
587440,"What can I say, I enjoyed this movie.  It wasn't as good as I expected, but was entertaining.Being the comic book geek that I am, I went into the movie expecting a sprawling epic, and suspensful tale of Jack the Rippers murders.  Instead we get a rather convulted story that sort of sticks to the plot of Alan Moores original graphic novel but not really.  Having read the behomth From Hell a few times now, I can point to parts where more character development could have been alittle better.  Particularly with the character of William Gull.  In the book he is much more of a disturbed psycho than in the movie.  He books shows that he used to cut up animals as a kid, and had a bad experience sexually with his wife.  His obsession with the freemason rhetoric is also very disturbing in his book as well as the fact that he believes he is creating a work of art.  All of these things would have helped in character development and made it much more disturbing.  Johnny Depp plays a decent Aberline, and looks the part, other than the fact Aberline in the book is alittle more plump.  Heather Graham seems oddly out of place in this movie.  Now why is it all the other prostitutes are ugly and she is the only good looking one of the bunch.  She does a good job as Mary Kelly though.Another thing I noticed was the romance seems to very aparent in the movie, but in the book it is more or less implied.  In the book they don't even know each others names and when she disapears Aberline doesn't really know what to think.In my opinion the best scene in the movie was when Gull is taking out Kellys heart.  He hallucinates that he is doing an anatomy lesson is very chilling and psychological.  Overall I realize the book and the movie are diffrent, but I still like From Hell quite a bit.  It was one of the better adaptations I have seen in a while.",From Hell

He gets angry and delivers a bone crunching tag on a player which gets him a place on the football team. Now, don't get me wrong. I like Adam Sandler. I really do. But, this is just too awful. The funny voices he always does get old in the first 2 minutes. A whole movie of it is unbearable!. It's also sad to see a great actress like Kathy Bates in this. What was she thinking?. Same with Henry Winkler. Fonz, this isn't cool!. Fairuza Balk, as the love interest, is shrill and unappealing. So is this whole movie. A waste of money, time, and talent. Folks, it doesn't get any more sickening than The Waterboy. If you like Sandler, I recommend ""The Wedding Singer"", ""Big Daddy"", and ""Happy Gilmore"".

584309,"This movie came and went in theaters so fast I didn't get a chance to see it, but I rented it because Pootie Tang was always funny on the Chris Rock show, and I consider Chris Rock one of the funniest men in America. Pootie Tang is a rapper who speaks some sort of very extreme rap lingo, to the point where you cannot understand a word he says. Meanwhile, everyone else always understands him (kind of like Chewbacca, somehow the other characters can interpret what he says perfectly) though once in a while they'll say, ""What the hell you talkin about?""The plot isn't complex, Pootie fights bad guys (like drug dealers) with his magic belt, sings songs that somehow people can understand, and the ladies love him. Chris Rock plays his father, one of his friends, a DJ, and probably some other character I'm forgetting. Meanwhile The Man wants to brainwash Pootie into endorsing their horrible product, and (surprise surprise) he loses his magic belt, and goes on a mission to get it back. Wanda Sykes is great as...uh...I forget her name, but she narrates the story and helps Pootie, plus she wears a different cool-... wig in every scene. I wasn't rolling on the floor laughing, but the movie was funny and entertaining It starts out with Bob Costas interviewing him and saying he's gonna show a clip from his movie, 80 minutes go by, maybe even less (the end credits seemed to go on for 10 minutes) . The opening, with him fighting Dolemite-type bad guys, is hilarious. I also was impressed that the movie didn't rely on gross-out humor and wasn't violent-I don't think anyone got killed- and has a positive message that makes it a good family movie. I think it was ""Do right, fight what's wrong, but the important thing is to love the world while you're doing it ."" And what's wrong with that?",Pootie Tang
528925,"This movie is about what it was like to be a fan of 70s album music, albeit from the privileged viewpoint of a teenage journalist who had access to rock groups that most of us could only dream about.  Though I didn't see the movie in a cinema, I'm one of the fans who has gone a bundle with its release on video, buying both the DVD and the soundtrack CD.  Though there are already 268+ reviews of the DVD on this site, I feel I just have to say how much I too love it.What I love about the movie, besides its gentle humour, its superb choice of music and uplifting theme, is that the characters are so fully rendered that there is so much going on in each scene.  Take the moment where guitarist Russell first speaks to William's Mum on the phone -- though the key to the scene is that she manages to freak even him out, writer/director Crowe still finds space in the same moment for Penny Lane to fend off another groupie making herself too available to Russell.I also like the fact that the plot contains no bad guy or violence.  Though in the UK the DVD carries a '15' rating -- for the use of expletives -- I'm happy to let my ten-year-old daughter watch it with me.  (I'm using it mainly as a covert means of getting her to appreciate the 70s music that I enjoy so much!)Despite the fact that there's no bad guy and the superficial resemblance of the film to a road movie, we shouldn't allow our senses to be beguiled into ignoring the clever plot structuring, which is still based on the Hero's Quest map used for 'Star Wars', 'Lion King' etc.  Lester Bangs makes an excellent mentor in this movie -- far more wisdom spews from his lips than say, William's Mum's.  Setting the climax in an aircraft poised on the brink of crashing in an electrical storm was a brilliant stroke.The choice of songs for the movie was excellent. Camercon Crowe chose the high-quality album tracks of the period, rather than the dance-oriented oldies that most nostalgia movies go for. 1972-76 is the period in rock that I ought to know best, but there are several songs here, such as 'Tiny Dancer', 'Mr Farmer' and 'Every Picture Tells a Story', which I hadn't heard before. Even the Cat Stevens' track ('The Wind') was a revelation which has considerably increased the respect I have for the artist.  My appreciation of Led Zep's acoustic numbers and even Simon &amp; Garfunkel has also improved as a result of Crowe's highly intelligent juxtaposition of sound and vision. But I still loathe Rod Stewart!But the soundtrack sound quality is so good that I'm half-convinced that Crowe re-re-mastered many of the tracks specially for the movie.Much of today's expletive-loaded music seems to do nothing but encourage violence and bring out the worse in people.  (There I go sounding like William's Mum!) The late 60s and early 70s was a time when music tried to elevate our senses.  Many thanks, Cameron, for making this excellent tribute to the period.  One of my teenage friends at the time regularly went on about what a superb journalist Lester Bangs was.  Now I know what he meant.",Almost Famous

His son was kidnapped by lost tribe of the amazon. He searched endlessly for his missing son for 10 years. It is based on true story. The acting is very good and the location is beautiful. Too bad the DVD can't displayed it properly as the color is a bit pale and dark. The sound is Dolby 2.0 only and a bit let down, especially after the DVD opens with the high power MGM logo presented in Dolby 5.1 and when it plays the film, you can immediately feel the drop in the sound quality.

205807,"Preston Sturges, as a director, had a strong fancy for trains.  In SULLIVAN'S TRAVELS, he had a great railroad yard sequence in which an old tramp was killed by a streamliner, and later Joel McCrea and Veronica Lake spent much time in freightcars.  Here, Sturges again picked out a railroad car - a private Pullman to Florida - for a wild and slapstick farce.  Claudette Colbert, fleeing from her husband in New York, finds herself in Pennsylvania Station without a cent.  Here she is taken in tow by the millionaire members of the Ale &amp; Quail Club - who are going south for their annual shoot-'em up and drink-em'-down vacation.  What happens on the train is one of the funniest scenes in vintage comedy.  Rudy Vallee plays the world's richest  man who believes that it's un-American to give more than a 10-cent tip; he was praised by the critics for this performance because he showed he could do more than croon the Maine STEIN SONG, and act ineptly as he did in his early talkies.  As John D. Hackensacker III, Vallee (playing straight comedy) rescues Claudette from the pyrotechnics of the Ale &amp; Quail Club and takes her to Palm Beach on his yacht.

577689,"I had to laugh when I saw a one-star review for this film. I agree this film is not for everyone. It's really only for those who actually watch AND listen to a film. The comedy here is subtle (if you're looking for Adam Sandler/Rob Schneider humor, look elsewhere). Don't get me wrong; if you get the humor you WILL laugh out loud. The genius of Christopher Guest and his troupe of actors (which include the brilliant Catherine O'Hara, Eugene Levy, Parker Posey, Michael McKean, Michael Hitchcock and the Oscar-overlooked Fred Willard) is that they inhabit these people so completely because they know people like this EXIST. They put a satirical spin on them, but these people are types, not stereotypes and that makes the humor so much more satisfying. If you enjoyed the great &quot;Waiting For Guffman&quot; or &quot;This Is Spinal Tap&quot;, you'll love this.

390392,"A terrific movie which exposed the mindless artificiality of some thirties Fifth Avenue socialites with sparkling verve and wit. A whimsical tale of a well-born down-and-out who's engaged as the butler for a family of wealthy loonies (whom he saves later from financial ruin). As in most such escapades, this wacky social farce relies on the comic expertise of its cast. In the title role, William Powell is completely at home with Godfrey Smith's wry humour and unflappable reactions to the unpredictable chaos all around him. Carole Lombard, as a heroine less vivid than in 1934's TWENTIETH CENTURY or 1937's NOTHING SACRED is as zany as she is beautiful, however icey, cynical Gail Patrick frequently manages to steal the scenes they share and ultimately leaves the more indelible impression. As the flibbertigibbet mother, Alice Brady portrays a fluttering, falsetto-voiced scatterbrain with amusingly innane dialogue: ""If you're going to be rude to my daughter, you might as well at least take your hat off""! Basement-voiced Eugene Pallette, as the Bullocks' failing breadwinner, is, as always in fine form. Mischa Auer's ape-mimicking Brady protege almost makes the nuttiest of the clan look sane! Jean Dixon, the gal who plays Molly, the all-wise household maid delivers her lines with exquisite comic timing; she should have had more to do in films. The fun lies in the development of character as the Bullock clan's fortunes change for the worse and they learn a few lessons in humanity. The wit derives form a well-crafted screenplay by Morrie Ryskind, Eric Hatch and Gregory La Cava, and the verve is easily attributable to the inspired guidance of comedy expert La Cava, a director known for his penchant for improvisation.",N/A

541822,"Strikingly original and gloriously film-noir, Memento is a rare film that finds the perfect marriage between substance and style without sacrificing the tension, drama, and humor in its well-written script.  The first offering from writer-director Christoper Nolan, and adapted from one of this own short stories, Memento engages audiences of all levels in a murder mystery of the first caliber.Leonard (Guy Pierce) is hot on the trail of the man who murdered and killed his wife.  He, too, was injured in the attack, rendering him unable to record any new memories - everything fades after around 10 minutes.  Although he remembers everything until he blacked out, including his wife lying dead on the floor, he has formed no new memories since that time.  This unusual condition has obviously rendered his search somewhat problematic, and Leonard is forced to rely on scribbled notes, photographs, maps, and tattoos to attempt to piece together his investigation.In what has been described alternately as a pedantic, pretentious film-school choice and a masterful way to tell a story, the story is told in 10-minute segments, starting at the END and working backwards.  Therefore, the audience can piece things together in a way Leonard cannot, and our reality becomes totally different from the main characters'.  In fact, one could make the case that Memento is a meditation on the meaning and reliability of memory in and of itself, but I'll leave that one to the scholars.With its legions of fans, it's a wonder this DVD wasn't released with more extras on it.  In fact, there are FOUR different versions of Memento on the world market, and all four DVDs have their strengths and weaknesses.  The American NTSC-format Region 1 version, seen here, has an interview and the incredible Memento website on it (which, I should note, adds to the story, but only look at it after you've seen the movie, because it might spoil some things).  The Canadian version of the film, also a Region 1 NTSC DVD by Alliance, has no extras but has an option where you can select the film's chapters in chronological order, allowing you to see the movie &quot;backwards&quot; (forwards, really).  The French and Belgian version is Region 2 PAL, and lacks all the extras but has an option where you can actually play the film in chronological order, instead of having to go back to the chapter screen 48 times.  And, last but not least, the planned UK Region 2 PAL release (slated to hit the streets on January 14, 2002) will have a director's commentary, the &quot;play chronologically&quot; feature, but none of the American version's extras.This shouldn't surprise people, as Memento was released first in the UK and did significantly better there at the box office than it did here.  However, unless you want to import a DVD from Europe - which requires a DVD player configured not only to play Region 2 discs, but one that can translate a PAL signal to an NTSC signal - the American version will be just fine.  The picture and sound are great, and the chronological mode is basically, as a friend put it, a gimmick.  And, with a movie as good as this, we can live without a commentary.",Memento VHS

320805,"I really do like this movie. It's not intended to be funny or comedic, it's not a 'tramp' film. Instead, it is the musings of an old man, who has reflected on his life, realized how great he was once, how poorly he has become, and yet never gives up hope. This is a pretty serious dramatic film, actually, which seems to me why people didn't accept it too well: they were expecting something silly. The film does have its sillier moments, of course, especially with Buster Keaton, and a bit of clowning and dialouge, such as the flea circus bit.I find that Chaplin had an incredible speaking voice, and was very well capable of playing a dramatic role. Considering how his life went, as the movie seems to follow pretty closely, it makes sense. The relationship between the Chaplin and the ballerina is fascinating, how they keep each other from death, how they give each other hope.

Roman soldiers on motorbikes?Well, it works for me.As an example of the latter, Tamora's sons playing on theirarcade video games, this just seems contrived.Killing the nurse with the pool cue on the other hand - that works.So I suppose it is a tight line the director has to walk in anadaptation like this and I think Ms Tamor acquits herself well.Towering over this movie is Anthony Hopkins portrayal of Titus.One of the great acting performances of Shakespearean cinema.And Jessica Lange?

543882,"&quot;American Pie 2&quot; is a very hard film to review. Why? Because, on a purely filmmaking level, it is not as good a movie as the first. It has a weaker (almost non-existent) story, almost completely ignores all of the female characters from the first film, and has very little purpose other than to entertain. On the other hand, somehow it manages to be exponentially more fun than the first film, which, although I loved it, was weighed down by its moral that sex is not as good as its cracked up to be, unless it's with someone you love. It is more fun than the first film, more hilariously, gutbustingly funny, and is also one of the few sequels that (1) should not be missed and (2) is a logical extension of the first film. What do I mean by that? This sequel wisely picks up jokes and story threads from the first movie, and reworks and twists them in ways that make them even funnier. One would never guess watching the first film how some throwaway lines and jokes pay off in this second film. More than most sequels, this is a truly a companion movie to the first.Another great idea is how the small, yet extremely popular character of Michelle (the band-camp girl) from the first movie, is expanded into a much fuller, more poignant character in this, the second film.I will guarantee you that, if you have an open mind for humor, and enjoyed the first film, you will have a great time with this movie.

Being a big fan of action flicks, particularly the `Lethal Weapon' series, I was hoping to get a few chuckles from the endless array of action-movie-cliche spoofs, deadpan dialogue with plenty of double-take-producing double-entendre &amp; puns, and silly sight gags that would doubtlessly pop up in this genre parody. You know, kinda like the `Naked Gun' flicks, but even more over-the-top. Only problem is, most of the gags fall flat, or were just plain dumb.

I thought Emilio Estevez and Samuel L.

325102,"Simply put this is the finest Muppet film of them all and easily one of the best family films of all time.  There are quiet little messages of hope and humanity hidden beneath the hijynx of the characters that is somehow missing in subsequent films (especially Muppets From Space).  From the Muppets interacting in the &quot;real&quot; world to the famous 'Kermit riding a bicycle' scene, everything presented here was fresh and new when it came out and suprisingly, retains that feeling today.  You'd have to have a heart of stone not to find this film charming, funny, uplifting and just all out entertaining.  It's just too bad it received such a mediocre DVD release.On the plus side, the film is presented in both it's widescreen (anamorphic!) and formatted versions with a Dolby Digital 5.1 soundtrack.  Plus there is a very funny, though hard to hear at times, screen test showing Kermit and Fozzie in different real world locations.  It must've been to see how believeable the Muppets could be in our world, but unfortunately no context is given on the DVD.  There are a few trailers you can choose to see as well as an odd feature called &quot;Muppetisms&quot;.  They're simply 30 second to a minute long segments featuring a muppet or two being wild and crazy.  What they're from or supposed to be about is beyond me, but they are fun to watch - once.  The biggest problem with this DVD is the picture quality.  Not only is it grainy, but the colors seem to bleed into each other through out the film.  Worse the color tends to lean towards the red end of the color spectrum.  Why more care wasn't taken in transfering this film is beyond me as it's a classic and one of Jim Hensons landmarks.Don't let these failings and oddities sway you from owning this masterpiece though if you don't already own it on video.

Throw in a bang-up performance by Christopher Lloyd (who I loved as Reverend Jim from &quot;Taxi&quot;), and I've got yet another reason to enjoy it. And of course there's the two soundtrack cuts by one of my fave 80's pop groups, Huey Lewis and the News. Let's face it- who DOESN'T think of the first celluloid adventure of Marty &amp; Doc when &quot;The Power of Love&quot; or &quot;Back In Time&quot; plays on that local Classic 80s Hits station that you have your radio tuned to?Aside from the concepts of time-travel, the story &amp; plot is fairly simple and straightforward, with few complications. Marty McFly (Michael J. Fox) goes back in time, and disrupts the past in a way that'll threaten his own existence. He then spends pretty much the rest of the flick trying to correct his mistake. Add in a few uncomfortable moments of Marty's future mother being smitten with him during his visit to the 50s, and you have... well, some rather funny uncomfortable moments. Kinda like those Luke &amp; Leia moments in the Star Wars trilogy, only intentionally funny. It's your basic Hollywood-style lighthearted &quot;feel-good&quot; comedy couched in a sci-fi theme. There's no need for deep thinking here, and don't worry about looking for a message or meaning. Just kick back and enjoy the ride. Save your brain cells for the sequels... they'll be needed more there than here.And now, a useless trivia tidbit: Look for a cameo by The News front man Huey Lewis. No fair peeking at the closing credits now! Besides, it wouldn't help anyway- he wasn't given a credit for his role, just the songs he performs. Here's a hint: he makes a comment about Marty's musical abilities. It's basically an in-joke, and it adds a humorous touch of irony to the scene. Happy hunting!'Late!",N/A
522773,"I loved everything about this movie. I wasn't sure at first, but after I saw it, I wasn't disappointed. Unlike most animated films, where everyone is very sappy. The characters had an edge to them. Cale felt abandoned by his father who promised he'd see him again. Akima wanted nothing more then have a home again. Korso drove himself hard to find Cale and keep him. It was a nice change of pace not to have singing in the middle of the movie, instead you have a great soundtrack. The animation was great. The aliens were different from what we have seen in other films. How many films have aliens with two knees and a bad attitude? I am a 22 year old woman who just fell in love with this movie. I don't think it's just for the little boys. You have so many strong character and you can only guesswork what they have lived through. I think Don Bluth did a great job. I can only say I was disappointed to hear they shut down the production of the video game.",Titan A.E. VHS

54135,"Okay, this is a feel good movie. You cry at the end because you are happy for Costner's character for having this supernatural chance to meet again with his father and ""have a catch"". They, beyond the grave, reconcile differences they had in life. The plot is fantasy at its best, very far-fetched, but with an excellent cast, which makes the story engaging and heartfelt. It is one of the few movies in which I have enjoyed Costner's performance and found him warm and likeable. Although at first his pairing with Amy Madigan as his wife seemed a bit strange, I came to appreciate their functioning as a family unit. Madigan and Costner are passable as 60s liberal leftovers who try to make a life as farmers in Iowa, but somehow are missing some magic that leads Costner into a quest for himself (midlife crisis, you could say) that makes him hear voices and obey their commands. James Earl Jones is excellent as Terrence Mann,  and it was nice to see Burt Lancaster play the small but pleasant role of Archibald ""Moonlight"" Graham. Ray Liotta was actually also a joy to watch as Shoeless Joe Jackson. I genuinely enjoyed the picture and appreciated that it did not try too hard to teach any lessons nor did it try to be anything more than it was. It also has at its heart a healthy love for American history and baseball's place in it.",N/A
178526,"I love Python, and even though this is not my favorite of their films, I still like it a lot. It's a bit uneven, moving forward as it does in fits and starts (as in the case of And Now For Something Completely Different, feature films do not make the best home for sketch comedy); Gilliam's Crimson Permanent Assurance short is well overlong, though amusing enough. Some of the other sketches misfire as well -- the search for the missing leg goes on far too long, though a good deal of the surrounding material (&quot;A tiger? In Africa?&quot; &quot;Shh!&quot;, plus the hilarious examples of british pluck in battle) still makes me laugh. Gilliam coming out of the Zulu suit is also a good bit. The American tourist couple in the Hawaiian Torture Chamber restaurant, however, brings the film, not just to a screeching halt, but damn well near to narcolepsy (if I want this kind of dialogue, I'll watch a Pinter play, thanks very much). And I could live a long and happy life if I never had to hear &quot;Christmas In Heaven&quot; (hip-hip-hip-hip-hip hooray!) EVER again.What does work: Jones and Palin's utterly brilliant &quot;Every Sperm Is Sacred,&quot; which does for the Catholic position on birth control what Yoko Ono did for the Beatles (sorry, that was a cheap shot). Ditto Eric Idle's &quot;Universe Song&quot;, which compresses billions of years into three minutes and still can't prove the existence of intelligent life on Earth. The boys' school scenes are vintage Python (Cleese's matter-of-fact sex-ed class is a scream), as are the WWI (WWII?) battle sequence and the drill sergeant bit (&quot;'Aven't you ever seen the 'And of God before?!&quot;). And of course, it wouldn't be Python without some disgusting humor -- the &quot;Organ Donor&quot; sketch, with Gilliam as the Jewish-sounding Rastafari, is a classic (&quot;Can we have your liver, then?&quot;); as is &quot;Mr. Creosote,&quot; which is simultaneously the most sickening and the most hilarious thing I've ever seen Python do. Terry Jones makes you want to laugh and puke at the same time, and that's an incredible triumph. And then there is the &quot;Death&quot; sequence, with Cleese as the Grim Reaper, which almost defies description it's so good. I love Palin's exit line in that bit. It's just too bad it's followed by the abovementioned &quot;Heaven&quot; sequence. (They should have gone to Hell instead -- it would have been a lot funnier!)There are other good bits in this film too -- such as when the Crimson Permanent Assurance attacks the film, and the beyond-surreal &quot;Middle of the Film&quot; bit, but that's all my heart can stand for now. If I had my druthers I'd watch Holy Grail or Life of Brian instead, but Meaning of Life is still worth watching.",N/A
227353,"Characters drive stories, regardless of their surroundings or ---in this case --- time.  Louis Gossett Jr. deserved an academy award for his work in the reptillian costume and his incredible use of voice and movements.  Absolutely high caliber acting.  Dennis Quaid is no less phenomenal but didn't have to wear a cumbersome outfit and makeup like Mr. Gossett did.  Most notable is the fact that this film was made over 16 years ago and is still an excellent science fiction movie.  Stands the test of time.The story is that of a pilot out in space on a space station who is helping to 'defend' the mineral rights and other human interests of this sector of the galaxy.  The only other living space-faring species out there are the Dracs.  Mr. Gosset plays a Drac known as Jareeba (or Jerry as Dennis Quaid comes to call him).  They are mortal enemies and nearly kill each other many times after each of their ships crash land on an unihabited planet that has impressive meteor showers, little food and funky weather patterns.  Eventually, through time and circumstances, these two enemies are forced to cooperate together so that they can survive and in so doing learn a little bit about each other and their respective societies.  They aren't that different, humanity and the Dracs.  An age-old story done over and over again, right?  True, but this one gives us a twist.  Jerry becomes pregnant (no he is neither female nor male.  Dracs simply become pregnant when the time is right).  But Jerry's pregnancy goes awry and he dies before giving birth.  Dennis Quaid has to cut the child out and raise it until he's rescued.  But should he be rescued by humans, what will happen to Zamis (the little Drac who grows rapidly)?  And if rescued by Dracs, what will happen to Dennis Quaid?Dennis becomes the father figure for Zamis and they are eventually 'rescued' from the planet by human slave traders that force Dracs into mining colonies.  What happens to Zamis in the end?  What can Dennis Quaid do to help Zamis survive?  Watch the movie and learn the twist on an old theme.  Excellent.",Enemy Mine VHS

One forgets that this area consisted mainly of farmland then.  The ""Sala Post"" house (""Sala Post"" was a pricipal character) is right down the road on Route 75 in Windsor...Parrish is a story about what it is like to be young and idealistic, in a time when it was still hip to be young and ralistic.  The film is beautifully photographed, lushly romantic, and sexy.  The often campy and stilted dialogue add to the fun.  This is a lark - don't take it too seriously.

81522,"Where do you go and to whom do you turn, when it's time to emerge from adolescence and get on with your life, but you find yourself incapacitated from having had your self esteem methodically peeled away year after miserable year by a brutal father who has convinced you that you're worth less than a piece of garbage a dog wouldn't touch?  That's the story of Muriel Heslop (Toni Collette), a young woman who, along with her brothers and sisters, has been mercilessly and ceaselessly denigrated and publicly humiliated by her father, Bill Heslop (Bill Hunter), seemingly since the day she was born, in ""Muriel's Wedding,"" directed by P.J. Hogan.  Bill Heslop is a local councilman in the less-than-thriving city of Porpoise Point, Australia.  In the eyes of those who don't know him, he's a great man, a hero even; and he's definitely a legend in his own mind.  But in his own home he doles out psychological abuse relentlessly-- and the sad thing is, he does it seemingly without realizing what he's doing.  Muriel, out of school, but so unsure of herself that she's unable to wrench herself free of the dominating Mr. Heslop, escapes into a world of ABBA songs and daydreams of her own wedding, which she perceives as being the ultimate reward-- the thing that will finally bring her happiness and give her life meaning.Not surprisingly, Muriel has some problems to work out before she can even think of making a change that will turn her life around.  Her lack of self esteem has rendered her socially inept, overweight, slow witted and incapable of making a decision.  And as far as the wedding that will change everything-- well, Muriel has no boyfriend, never has had one, and there are certainly no prospects on the horizon.  Her dream of being ABBA's ""Dancing Queen,"" is about as remote as pigs that can fly.  Muriel does have friends, however; four girls she knows from school, one of whom just got married, into whose lives she basically imposes herself in a last ditch effort to find acceptance any way she can.  Then one night, even they tell her not to come around them anymore, that she is an embarrassment.  And for Muriel, it's the final straw that drives her to do something desperate.  Something that will ultimately change her life forever.That it is billed as an ""Hilarious comedy about friends, fun and unexpected surprises"" and ""Hysterically funny,"" makes you wonder about the marketing machinery of the entertainment industry.  Is it a funny movie?  Yes, it is; just as life is often funny, even when it's at it's worst.  Hilarious?  Yes.  All of which seems contradictory to the story that is at the heart of the film.  And yet, it's those very contradictions, those same multi-layered complexities of which life is made, that makes this such a wonderful movie.  On one hand, Bill Heslop is one of the most despicable characters you'll ever encounter in a film; and on the other, Muriel is one of the most sympathetic.  The humor of this film is derived from the natural and very real situations in which the characters find themselves.  And just as there is something within us all that at times allows us to laugh at the misfortunes of others (perhaps occasionally born of a ""better you than me"" mentality), there are things you're going to laugh at in this film.  But as you sit back and watch as one misery upon another is heaped upon Muriel, you'd have to be either an unfeeling moron or a sociopath not to be crying at least on the inside, even if you're laughing on the outside.  There are times when you just want to reach out to Muriel and let her know that one way or another, everything is going to be okay.Toni Collette (in her second film) gives an incredibly moving performance as Muriel, making her about as real as a character can get.  She conveys so much through her body language and facial expressions alone, that you can feel the torment and the turmoil she keeps bottled up and buried deep within herself, without ever having to hear her speak a word.  Anyone who's ever known even a moment of misfortune in their life will be able to relate to her.  Unwittingly, she wears her feelings on her sleeve; not that she wants to, but when your cup of adversity finally overflows, it's going to show.  And it takes a special actor to play a character like this and make her so convincing, without taking it over the top or into the gray planes of melodrama.  And Collette is that actor.  She's perfect in this role, and she had to be for this film to work.  Anything less than a perfect counterpoint to the character of Bill Heslop would've quickly derailed this project, and the humor alone wouldn't have done the job.  All of the tricks, jokes and funny lines in the world wouldn't have been enough to overcome that very real sense of loathing Bill Hunter brings to the role of Heslop.The supporting cast includes Rachel Griffiths (Rhonda), Sophie Lee (Tania), Rosalind Hammond (Cheryl), Belinda Jarrett (Janine), Pippa Grandison (Nicole), Jeanie Drynan (exceptionally effective as Betty, Muriel's mother) and Daniel Lapaine (David).  In one of the most uplifting scenes you're ever likely to see in a movie, Muriel and Rhonda lip-sync to ABBA's ""Waterloo,"" which in the screenplay probably came across as something fun but rather insignificant in the grand scheme of things.  But on the screen, it becomes a moment that is absolutely transporting.  And that's the magic of ""Muriel's Wedding.""  It takes you into the dark, but never allows you to languish there; ultimately, it takes you into the light, and when it does, it's brighter than anything you could imagine.",N/A

I didn't &quot;take the journey&quot; with the characters.And there were good things about it. GREAT attention to detail. I mean I really felt like it was 1913, or whatever year it was, and that they were there.

I think this is the kind of movie that older people and my parents would really like. It's got all the elements of a &quot;good&quot; movie. The young callow guy and his dynamic with Mel Gibson's older more life experienced character. They go on cool travels. There are funny little moments here and there. It's sort of an epic.

And there were a couple moments at the end where I rolled my eyes like, &quot;oh come on. they're not going to THAT are they?&quot; But, they did.So all in all, I'd give it a C+, B- (more like a C+ though)Oh yeah, there a great shot of Mel's ass in this.",N/A

I won't say the British series is &quot;less of&quot; in any way. Both versions have their merits but an All-American gay boy coming from the US will most certainly relate much better with the US version simply because of &quot;culture&quot; which in-turn will make it far more entertaining and easier to understand. I wouldn't say making something easier to understand ""dumb downed.&quot; That's just a cheap shot as far as I am concerned in doing a fair review. America is just beginning to understand the whole &quot;gay community&quot; and it's philosophies (if it has any) &lt;grin&gt;. QAF-USA has developed a huge audience made of not only gay people but everyone!  Education seems to be the main focus for this series as many of it's stars and producers... convey in their chat interviews. The US version is most certainly made to educate and entertain, which it most certainly does. The British version (although educates somewhat) seems more in tune to entertain the audience. Rightly so! The British version broke new ground and pushed the envelope on the way Europeans watch prime time TV. That's something that will probably never happen in America-so BRAVO for the UK! If you really want to have a smidgen of understanding the &quot;core&quot; story, I suggest you purchase the first 8 episode DVD British version first and then start watching the more amplified characterization in the US version. You'll see why the US series is quickly becoming one of the most popular and most successful television shows in history. I also suggest you purchase the kickin US soundtrack, which will most certainly get you in the QAF mood. Cheers!",Queer as Folk British TV Series  VHS

474589,"One of the few movies I have ever seen that was so respected and admired that no one ever told anyone else what happened at the end. Rare, to say the least. At the heart of this exceptional film is a moving performance by Hollywood action star Bruce Willis (of all people) as a child psychologist trying to help a young boy who seems to be haunted by visions of ghosts. The film unfolds slowly, picking up pace after a half an hour or so and then seems to end all too quickly, with a surprise twist at then end that will leave your jaw hanging on the floor. What director M. Night Shyamalan has done here is nothing short of amazing. An involving, emotional, and frightening film that recalls the days when vile special effects were not needed to terrify the audience. Instead, Shyamalan juxtaposes between subtle visual suggestion and bold, striking images to constantly calm and then shock the viewer and it's a strategy that works beautifully. I have never been so frightened by the turning of a doorknob as I have been during this film. But as terrifying as it is, THE SIXTH SENSE is also a film about loss and redemption and love and it will easily move you to tears. Haley Joel Osment is superb in the role of Cole Sear, the small child haunted for reasons he doesn't fully understand. Child stars like this don't come along very often and here he gives a performance that is both heartbreaking and assuring. His growth in both character and understanding during the course of the movie never seems 'acted'... it is such a strong performance that we believe every word he says even when the characters on the screen beside him don't. He is remarkable. As is Toni Collette as his hard-working mother, a woman at a loss to explain what's happening to her son. But the key performance in the film, the one that sets the story down it's unforgettable path comes from a most unlikely source: ex- New Kids On The Block singer Donnie Wahlberg, who lost a lot of weight to play a bitter and terrified ex-patient of Willis's. It is an amazing bit of acting that not only sets up the story but also defines it. THE SIXTH SENSE is one of the best films of 1999 and deserves a place in your home library.",The Sixth Sense VHS

517589,"Like most film musical buffs not old enough to have caught this when it was new nor even to have seen it on TV, I have waited years to get a look at it. But ultimately it's a disappointment. If you happen to love Betty Hutton then you'll like it. But if she doesn't do much for you -- and she never has for me -- then her relentless mugging and stagey line readings wear thin real fast, and the film is in the end all about her. The score is great, of course, and most of it is here. But to see how Judy Garland rendered &quot;Doin' What Comes Natur'lly&quot; in the appendix, even obviously too ill to pull it off with professional verve, is to see what these songs CAN become in the right hands. In comparison, Hutton is paint-by-numbers BIG. Then you have the problem with MGM musicals of this period -- the constant tug towards bland apple-cheekedness. Midway through, Annie Oakley is abruptly transformed from dirty-faced hoyden to glowing, coiffed MGM blonde, and starts singing her numbers in a drippy &quot;girl singer&quot; style that would have been alien to the character she first introduced us to. We condescend to the film to assume that this was &quot;just the way it was in old movies&quot; -- musicals like FORTY-SECOND STREET or even MGM's own THE BAND WAGON conveyed humanity with more nuance even within the strictures of the period. At another studio, they would have let Frank fall in love with something closer to what Annie really was, a much more interesting story. Howard Keel is good as always; the occasional number is not bad (&quot;My Defenses are Down&quot; comes off especially well). But overall, you get a kid's vision of a Wild West show, J. Carroll Naish's rather funny turn as an &quot;Indian&quot;, and a lot of forced, loud corn.Where now is Berlin's other lost film musical, CALL ME MADAM?

But her and Van love each other and they say that they can see each other whenever they want. I don't know if that means they will teleport, or if they will just see each other in visions and dreams... Sigh....

211979,"FRIDAY THE 13th PART III(USA - 1982)Aspect ratio: 2.35:1 (3-Depix)Theatrical soundtrack: MonoThough not without entertainment value, the third entry in this long-running series (initiated by FRIDAY THE 13th in 1980) is no more than disposable fluff, reliant on its 3-D gimmick to draw a mass audience. It serves no other purpose. Whereas the first two movies established the basic premise (the villain in part 2 takes up where his/her predecessor left off in part 1), ""Part III"" doesn't advance the scenario at all, merely restages the same plot as before: Teens take a weekend trip into the woods and are targeted for destruction by the seemingly unstoppable Jason.The plot is negligible, the characters conform to stereotype, and the constant stream of violent murders seems even more senseless than before. In fact, the indiscriminate nature of Jason's victims allows consistency to fall by the wayside, thereby signalling the film's status as little more than a mindless thrill-machine, the victim of lazy scriptwork by Martin Kitrosser and Carol Watson. To be fair, however, it's doubtful that a radical change in the basic scenario would have been acceptable to contemporary audiences. In 1982, these simple thrills were more than enough to ring the box-office bell, and woe betide any producer who dared to mess with a winning formula!The best efforts of sophomore director Steve Miner (also responsible for FRIDAY THE 13th PART 2, 1981) are compromised by two important factors: First, the cast seems to have been chosen on the basis of looks rather than acting ability, and the only character with a halfway decent plot-thread (the overweight guy whose feeble pranks are a desperate attempt to ingratiate himself with his peers) meets a predictably 'ironic' end long before his genuine emotional distress can be allowed to detract from the orchestrated mayhem. And secondly, the requirements of 3-D photography - in particular, the attention paid to the point of convergence from shot to shot, in order to prevent eyestrain and headaches in the audience - has resulted in visual and dramatic compromises, slowing the movie's rhythm and sapping all vitality from the narrative (this was true of many other 3-D movies which opened the following year). Seen in 3-D, the extra dimension is a genuinely effective novelty which enhances the viewing experience tenfold, from the opening credits (which seem to shoot out of the screen with startling clarity) through to the extended finale when Jason's rampage literally spills into the audience's lap. Viewed flat, for all its bloody violence and exaggerated body count, the film is a lumbering, pointless rehash of the first two entries, with no identity of its own.Followed by FRIDAY THE 13th: THE FINAL CHAPTER (1984).","Friday the 13th, Part 3 VHS"

It is one of those rare films that brings tears to one's eyes even while it makes one want to cheer (which the audience did in several places, including the end.) My only problem with the film is that I was led to believe that Peter Jackson shot it in New Zeeland. Clearly Jackson found some way to get a camera crew to Middle Earth and somehow get some of the original participants in the War of the Ring to recreate the events they actually lived. I do not believe that, for example, we see Ian McLellan playing Gandalf. I will wager that Gandalf is playing himself.--Mark R. Whittington (...)",The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring

There is just something uplifting about seeing a young woman, who is in a rough neighborhood with rough relatives and rough peers, handle it all by learning literally how to be the best fighter she can possibly be. She trains to be a professional boxer.  She even gets to box her boyfriend in the ring, who also wants to go pro. We were both laughing during this part because actually it probably would be a tremendous help to marriage and relationships to pick someone you could literally go into the ring against and beat the hell out of them (professionally speaking, of course).  This sure would be one marriage or relationship where abuse of one party would have a hard time arising!

Being a guy and all, I basically picked it up because of Katherine Heigl. After watching it, I think that the only thing that kept it from being promoted more was the not-so-original story of people switching bodies.Yet, the movie is just sheer charm and fun. Both Danielle Harris and Heigl are an absolute joy to watch. Perfectly cast. Well-crafted and touching.  Both stars show personalities that had previously not been shown in their other movies;  making this a highly enjoyable movie that exceeds, by far, some of the more heavily promoted theatrical releases of the same genre.Perfect movie for a rainy, boring day.

After you watch the movie, you will ruminate over it for days. It is that powerful.Powder is our hero, a teenager who is misunderstood and unloved, even by his own family. When he emerges into our world from his grandparents' basement, he cannot even comprehend how cruel people can be every day.Some films have various layers you have to get underneath before they go to your heart, like Forrest Gump. Powder is a film that will go straight to your heart, and will not leave.The setting in which the movie takes place is rural middle America, but seems like another world. The entire movie is akin to a dream. It will probably wont make you cry when you see it, but rather when you have time to fully digest what you have just watched.The best part about this movie is it provides deep emotion without being visually disturbing or graphic. It keeps a very respectable PG-13 rating. You can even feel sorry for the antagonists in the film, and soon you start to empathize with Powder. You could call it a teen Forrest Gump, although Powder's character is less real, but more beautiful than Forrest.I highly recommend this movie. I have talked to ruffian-type teenagers who saw this movie and they despised it. This is because they saw themselves in the antagonists so vividly, that it deeply disturbed them. I liked that.

After an exciting start detailing the capture of the violent ""gill-man,"" the plot drags a little during the creature's captivity in ""Ocean Harbor,"" a forerunner of Sea World.  As the man-fish languishes on display for gawking spectators, Professor Clete Ferguson (John Agar) moons around the delectable Helen Dobson.  Both are academic types studying the creature, and each other.  These romantic interludes (not to mention the pointless Flippy the porpoise segment) become tiresome, and one squirms waiting for the script to get back to the sci-fi/horror plot.  Thankfully, the gill-man eventually breaks loose and typical monster-movie mayhem prevails.  The panicked crowd fleeing Ocean Harbor in their best '50s summer-wear evokes chuckles.  Rarely have we seen so many white shirts, crewcuts, and bobby sox in one place.  And checkout those Panama hats.  As the gill-man makes his way down to the sea through various canals and inlets, he brings dreadful death to clueless victims.  They fatuously wander around at night, although there is a well-publicized monster on the loose.  Feeling conflicted by freedom lust and other lusts, the gill-man stalks Helen, who lounges around in swimwear, underwear, etc.  She obligingly stays by water, and leaves her doors and windows open and unlocked.

Also, once he finds out there's a giant spider around, he flies to some professors 200 miles away without telling anyone in the town. I know no one would have believed him, but that brings us to the biggest plot hole of all. Are we really suppossed to believe that absolutely no one has seen this thing walking around? At least the scientist and &quot;Steve&quot; should have noticed; it was right behind their car in the beginning! However, I did find Leo G.

Marlowe's deadpan private dick persona seems a bit out of place with all the love beads, paisley and acid-spiked cigarettes swirling about him. (I suppose you could argue that it boosts the film's appeal on a purely camp level). Garner makes up for most of the incongruity (and the rather complicated plot) with his usual devil-may-care on-screen appeal. A few supporting perfomances also keep things moving along, including a very sexy Rita Moreno and surprisingly funny Bruce Lee. Lee eats up his two brief scenes with much aplomb and choreographs a memorable rooftop &quot;exit&quot; for his irrepressible Winston Wong. Not classic Chandler, but an entertaining curio nonetheless.",Marlowe VHS
535301,"Don't get me wrong, I loved the film (any movie that drives out a group of senior citizen viewers 40 minutes into it is GOLDEN to me) but the whole time I could not shake the feeling that it was nothing but the violents bits of Lock,Stock warmed over with a darker storyline and more dumb humor.Lock,Stock was a classic not only for the violence, the quick edits, and the vernacular, but for the intricately plotted storyline that effortlessly interwove a cast of many into one big tapestry that flowed perfectly.  Snatch seemed disjointed, almost as though the interactions were forced there, just to suit a gag later on, or merely to invent some eccentric humorous character.  Nowhere do you get the feeling that this is more than just a funny heist-gone-wrong movie, unlike Lock,Stock which was a very well-thought-out cohesive film.Brad Pitt?  Big deal.  He barely spoke in the entire film.  Yet the theater practically erupted in paroxisms of sympathy laughter when he did.  I'm guessing people were more into the role he played than how he played it.  The movie would have been better without him (though I'm sure his presence helped the box office receipts.)  Dennis Farina (real life ex-cop) is SO genuine as the exasperated American of the caper.  Brick-Top is genuinely scary, and Vinnie Jones gets to play another smooth-talking tough guy.  The rest are either pathetic or forgettable, and that goes for the 2 leads, as well as Benicio Del Toro.Not a wretched cash-in sequel, but definitely not the inspired work of art of Ritchie's first and superior film.

Now I am delighted to find that star-studded film on DVD with the Anchor Bay label.  As has been pointed out by many, this plot fits the Agatha Christie pattern in which an isolated group of people (on an island, a train, a boat) experience murder and the guilty party must be one of themselves. In one of them, they ALL did it. In two of them, the detective did it. In one of them the only two who could not have possibly done it did it. In the slim case you do not know the solution to &quot;Death on the Nile,&quot; I will say no more.As with &quot;Murder on the Orient Express,&quot; the period d&eacute;cor is just about perfect and each one of the Big Names in the cast gets at least two good scenes in which to do their thing. Possibly Maggie Smith can be singled out as giving us the most subtly comical character in many a film. Angela Lansbury, on the other hand, pulls out all the stops as the forever tipsy author of sex novels. And indeed the entire project has an obvious blend of comedy that helps make this (perhaps) a bit more watchable than was the far more serious &quot;Orient Express&quot; that had preceded it. (How seriously can you take a film in which the manager of the cruise ship exclaims &quot;Goody goody gumdrops&quot; when they dredge up the murder weapon?) (And how did the villain acquire a live cobra aboard the ship?)There is no point in comparing Ustinov's Poirot with Finney's in the &quot;Orient Express&quot; film, since they both are very good in their own ways and neither had David Suchet with whom to contend. What is a good example of missed opportunity is one of the DVD's bonus features that gives us an interview in Spanish with Ustinov in which he is not really being asked the right questions to elicit any really interesting answers. A similar interview with Jane Birkin proves even less enlightening.Among the DVD extras is a not-bad 24 minute &quot;Making Of&quot; short, the original trailer, and some short but detailed printed bios of the cast, included Harry Andrews, who shows up for only a few moments at the film's start.All in all, this is a DVD I know I will view many times in the future, as I have done with the full screen tape edition, but with far greater satisfaction.As a footnote, I should mention that Audio Partners has released a reading of the complete novel with David Suchet as narrator and the entire cast.

She pioneered many cinematic techniques in this film about the Nazi Party Day in Nuremberg, and the movie is brilliant from a technical point of view.  The fact that it was about the Nazis was purely an incident of history - she could have easily made the movie as a commission by the Republican Convention in the US had she been in the States at that time!

Many good films about ancient Rome have taken artistic license to make themselves entertaining. Even PBS' &quot;I Claudius&quot; took such liberties. The imagination required to create a spectacle like Gladiator is justification enough to watch and enjoy. Historical accuracy be damned.In addition to the many other merits of this film the action sequences are riveting though quite graphic.",Gladiator VHS
520958,"This movie was boring and non sensible for several reasons. First, the five man crew on Mars seemed to face impossible odds, where they sit and wait to die for five minutes with each problem, before some miracle saves them. Such as there is no air on Mars in reality, but at the last second when the crew is out of air, they then discover the air is breathable. Another impossible odd is when their own surveillance robot gets damaged then goes against the crew, just when you think the crew will die, the robot merely runs away. I am very open-minded, but the more amazing things I saw with the movie it just became an insult. It simply gets ridiculous how many killer problems the crew has to go through, and the 5 - 10 minutes the film kills time making the viewer believe that they will actually die. The special effects were great, but they can be seen in any other movie about space.",N/A
421337,"This movie is loaded with kilos of negative energy: scenes of fights and brawls between Skins and Chinese are really scary because it's real violence, not the cranberry juice sprinkled violence of action movies. All three main characters (Hando, his buddy Davey and doll-faced brat Gabriela) are hard to sympathize with: they are what they are and that's it. Speaking of &quot;love triangle&quot; seriously would be wrong in this film - yes, something like that is present here to move the film along, although what characters express can hardly be called love. And maybe something is wrong with my VCR, but I haven't noticed any &quot;blue haze&quot; the movie is supposed to be shot in, simply that's how the movies looked in 1993.Go search for charismatic Crowe somewhere else - in Romper Stomper he is as attractive as a rabid dog, although his character is sound of body and (relatively) of mind, he's brutal and haughty, but leader in him you can sense from afar (the saunter, the squint, the voice). Funny though, when Hando says, &quot;I want revenge&quot;, you'll see Maximus Decimus raising his head in defiance, &quot;I'll have my revenge in this life or next&quot;. That only proves Crowe not to be some Aussie upstart, but a person whose talent has remained integral for 10 years.In general, it's a movie to watch for those curious how R Crowe was starting his career, as well as to find out that such far and peaceful country as Australia has its racial problems. Otherwise, it's not an entertaining spectacle: leaves you with unpleasant aftertaste and your faith in human beings and their ability to live in peace strongly undermined.",Romper Stomper VHS

The pristine, clean-cut sounds and the album's mellow instruemental overtones conspire to make a truly great disc.  It's certainly not a 'kareokee album' in any way, the songs are very much instrumental and the lyrics are a bit too abstract for one to really enjoy the lyrical content of Two Against Nature.  Interestingly enough, in a year chalk full of controversy (sponsored by Eminem), Steely Dan did what some could call 'controversial' by making the Grammy-winning song &quot;Cousin Dupree&quot;.  The song describes an interest between two long-lost cousins with a small reference to incest.  Appearantly controversy is becoming much more of a trend than it ever has in the music industry.",N/A

249765,"Although credited to Norman Foster, and co-written by Joseph Cotton, Welles infact &quot;supervised&quot; (i.e. controlled) most of this production.  What we get is a tight and very compact (barely over an hour in length) thriller.Joseph Cotton plays an Engineer who someone is trying to assasinate.  Trapped on a steamship crosing the black sea, he avoids attempts on his life (several of them by Welle's real life business manager, Jack Moss).Think of &quot;Journey...&quot; as a practice run for &quot;Touch Of Evil&quot; and &quot;The Third Man&quot; (I know he didn't direct it but you'll see the similarities). The humour is broader, the dialogue not quite as sophisticated, but it is still Welles at work.  While not a major work of Art, it is still a masterpiece of craft.The Camera-work, as usual, is brilliant -- partucularly the interiors of the steam-ship.  Welle's always worked his cameramen hard, forcing them to new heights; lighting rooms &quot;without light&quot;, and building sets with ceilings (not a popular practice in the forties).  It pays off -- the clautrophobia on board the ship is extreme, and Cotton is excellent as it's primary sufferer.  Naturally the camera angles have Welles' innovative stamp all over them.If you're a Welles fan, &quot;Journey Into Fear&quot; is an absolute must see; a nice precurser (thematically, chronologically,  and cinematically) to &quot;The Stranger&quot;.And if you're not a Welle's fan, then you should give your corneas to someone more deserving.PS:Unfortunately there doesn't seem to be any plan for releasing this lost gem on DVD any time soon.  A shame, since &quot;Journey Into Fear&quot; (with it's short running time) would make an excellent double bill DVD with another Welles film (The Stranger, for example).",Journey Into Fear VHS

The most dramatic moment is when Paltrow's character lets an insult slip out of her mouth - an act most unbecoming a lady.From a technical point of view, this movie is nicely crafted. The acting is top-notch, and the story is tight. The look and feel of the period shows an attention to detail that is fun to watch.The only problem is that it was unable to make me care much about any of the characters, or what happened to them. Even when the characters were watching their lives crumbling, I still felt like a member of the audience, watching the actors moving around on the screen. Nothing that happened was able to draw me into the movie.",Emma VHS
416097,"This film deserves 2 stars because it is different and does make you feel sad and empty, so I guess you have to give a film something that makes you feel that way.  You also have to mind that these kids were just actors.  After having taught in the New York Public Schools in New York for two years and growing up as a white teen in the Mission Hill section of Roxbury, Massachusetts, I can say that the kids in this movie make up less than .2% of the kids in the inner cities.  Lots of kids have drank when they were 8 or 9 but not many of them act as stupid as these kids.  People just arent that bad in real life, and most of the kids in NYC are great.  Many kids in the suburbs or parts of the city that have money have an attraction to these kinds of movies becuase of some insecurities of their own, and want to be a part of this urban culture because of something that they are missing in their own lives.  I guess this movie had a message that people are bad in many cases, but overall it is a movie that doesn't have one likeable character or moment.

43832,"Having not heard what this 'SPAWN' thing was, nor having seen the movie, nor knowing who Todd McFarlane was or what he did - I bought 'SPAWN: Ultimate Collection' ( on DVD ) with a completely open mind.Why did I buy it ? Well, why is the sky blue ? All you meteorologists out their can give me an answer I'm sure, however, I can only say that my curiosity had the better of me.Having browsed in DVD stores and on the Internet I remembered that I heard of a movie called: SPAWN. I'm not sure how the hell I remembered such a thing - but I did.Anyway, to cut a long story short I bought SPAWN: Ultimate Collection ( The three series shown on HBO in the United States ).Back to the story.I opened my package and whacked it in the DVD player. From the moment I put the DVD in the player I was submerged into a dark world. A world where I have never been before. I've seen animated series before but this didn't compare to any of those that I had seen, in my opinion.SPAWN was better..!!I have to say that I enjoyed all three series and that each series got better. Just like a good wine, SPAWN matured damn well as the series embarked on its completion.Each character developed as the shows progressed and it was obvious that SPAWN himself was going to mature as a character. The emotions, feelings, sensations, anguish, anger, hate, love and lust were symptoms of a character that HAD to mature and evolve, otherwise, this could have ( and would have ) turned into a mediocre animated cartoon. Thankfully, as each show progressed so did the characters and the plot. It is such a pity that only three series were made. It would've been interesting to see how all of the characters would have developed over a longer period.I have to say that it is a violent animation with plenty of adult language and nudity but it fits into what Todd McFarlane wanted for the HBO timeslot ( according to what I heard in his DVD interview on the flip side of the third disc of the series ). A cartoon with content to suit its audience in which case was adults over the age of 18.All in all it was brilliant and I enjoyed every second of it. The only down side of this is that there wasn't any more after the third series ( I don't think ). Such a pity because as I stated the characters were all beginning to bloom and show their worth. For me, all the three series intertwine and one cannot do without the other, hence, the third series was so good.I know there have been a couple of people that reviewed SPAWN and rubbished it. Well, to each his/her own is my opinion. You didn't like it then good on you for warning people who don't like this type of animation and content, or lack thereof. My problem is that the people who do rubbish it have to think that we are ""under-14-year-old (mentally, if not physically) male? "" .People have opinions, however, this is best kept to oneself. Generalizing in this manner typifies the immaturity of the person who writes it. It is also just pissing other people off who do actually like SPAWN and have the intelligence enough to make their own decisions on what is good and what is bad without the extra dialogue  that comes with it. If you don't like a movie point out the garbage within it but NOT the supposed immature and intellectual idiots that watch it..!!Overall, I found this series d***good and I enjoyed it heaps. If, however, you're a bit worried then I'd rent it out ( if you can...unlike where I am here in Australia ) then get it rented and make up your own mind.Finally, everything about SPAWN has got me hooked just like a happy fly-fisherman with a 5kg salmon on the end of the line. Well, that is my opinion. I'm sure there are others that will think otherwise.To each his own........",N/A
313576,"The remake of The Blob is a high octane monster movie packed with attacks and effects, for the first forty-five minutes or so.  Then it slows down a little and settles into the typical monster on the loose with the teenagers saving the world plot that make those drive-in schlock fests of the fifties so much nostalgic fun.Once again a meteorite slams into earth and from within it slithers a blob of protoplasm that absorbs any flesh it comes in contact with.  As the blob grows it becomes more and more aggressive in its attacks, each a show stopper, until it's oozing down main street USA, the populace running for their lives.  Can it be stopped?Writer/director Chuck Russell (who co-wrote this with The Shawshank Redemption's Frank Darabont) is an obvious fan of fifties horror, this movie being one on 80s cinema steroids.  While he doesn't neglect the characters, developing most of them enough to care about whether or not they are engulfed or narrowly escape the horrible fate of being an evening snack for the overgrown amoeba, the individual attack scenes are the highlights.  Well worth the purchase price, or at least a rental.  Recommended.",The Blob VHS

At that time I told them no, but if they wanted the &quot;prequel&quot; to check out &quot;Manhunter.&quot;  To me, this was on par, with &quot;Silence.&quot;In &quot;Manhunter,&quot; we are introduced to the forensic area of psychological profiling of a serial killer.  We see the results of what happens when one of these profilers gets too close to the mind of Hannibal Lektor/Lector.  While it might not be as accurate as &quot;Silence of the Lambs,&quot; (John Douglass of the FBI's Behavioral Crime Unit was an advisor), it still has all the makings of a great crime film.Because of the director (Michael Mann), it's got '80's written all over it. From the glitz to the art shots so prevalent in &quot;Miami Vice.&quot; But sometimes it's great to have a little reminder of what we used to watch twenty years ago!  The soundtrack was interesting, although I thought that it got in the way of some of the dialog.Brian Cox was great as Hannibal. While he isn't portrayed as the sociopath that we have all grown to love in &quot;Silence,&quot; he is, however resourceful and highly intelligent.  In comparing Cox and Hopkin's portrail of Hannibal, I thought that both were actually downplayed.  In either of these films, Hannibal could have been made into an over the top evil villian, but both Mann and Demme looked to have their actors subdue the roles, which I think makes them much more menacing.My only negative comment regarding this movie (or should we call it the Hannibal Trilogy), is that we never see the capture of Lector. There are a few loose ends that could have been tied up, but otherwise a great movie to own and watch. It's one of those movies that you can pick things up in each time you watch it.

52071,"The actual rank I give this film is 3.5 stars.If you have a chance to watch this movie and time is not rushing your way - do it. It can all be summed up to a harmless action 'flick' , that offers the viewer a couple of hours with the old Willis' McLain we all know all to well from the 'Diehard' trilogy . In addition to that , you find a kind of routine man plus kid getaway from the bad guys thriller , which is enriched with a secondary interesting (though superficial) dramatization of the autism's syndrome .The matching of Willis with the child works quite well . My hunch is that this role had turned Night Shyamalan's attention to Willis , this attention ended up in a collaboration that was concluded in Willis' biggest blockbuster to date . This point of view makes the film more interesting , because you get a chance to watch Willis making his first steps in an uncharted territory for him . Eventually this journey brought him also the role in 'Disney's the kid' and of course in 'Unbreakable' , so it's pretty nice to see another brick in his developing career .Aside from that , the movie is vastly flawed and has lots of holes in the script and plot . I recommend a good and through review of a Canadian writer , that wrote one of the first reviews about this movie and really pointed out  all the defects this product has , in a funny and humorous manner . Nevertheless , for an entertaining movie that doesn't take itself too seriously these are bearable defects you can live with .

I will admit it's a bit better (my actual rating for this movie is 2 and a half) but it should not have been made in the first place but that's show biz. The story is about a 16 year old named Sally (Coralina Cataldi Tassoni) who is having a sweet sixteen party but when she takes a break from her party to watch TV a demon from a documentery about what happened in the first DEMONS comes out of the TV and possess her and the rest of the movie which is set in a glass high-rise apartment building (with bullet proof glass)is basically demons gobbling up the people in the building. The movie still has a lot of gore and blood but unlike the first DEMONS there is not a huge abundance of it.Thank goodness. And the characters in the script are not as dumb as the ones in the first DEMONS though don't misunderstand me, it's still a poor script.

It is interesting, an interesting (and relevant!) approach to our fake televisionized Big Brother world. And The Truman Show gives the meta theme a lot of humouristic touches as well.In other words, a great film.

However, the other actors (almost all of whom are native americans) play their parts incredibly well, pulling you into their lives, and tugging at your spirit and heart.If you're tired of the 'hollywood' junk out there, and want to see something fresh and rejuvenating, pick up this movie.

I was highly disappointed in the quality of Tim Robbins acting.  It has seemed his film career has really taken off lately, but it takes a step back with the making of Antitrust.  The directing was OK, but nothing to brag about.  But I did think Milo (Phillippe) figured everything out way to quickly.  And the bad guy/good guy was easy to figure out.

Their star, Abdullah (Wee Willlie Davis), refuses to loose when they tell him to and he returns home to Algeria.  The boys have to go after Abdullah and bring him back because they borrowed $5,000 from the syndicate to bring him to America in the first place.  However, Abdullah's cousing, Sheik Hamud El Khalid (Douglas Dumbrille) and the evil Foreign Legionnaire Sgt. Axmann (Walter Slezak), have been raiding the railroad being constructed so they can get rich extorting money for protection.  The bad guys assume Bud and Lou are spies for the railroad and order them killed.  Lou has also upset the Sheik by outbidding him on six beautiful slave girls, including Nicole (Patricia Medina), a French spy.  Anyhow, the boys end up enlisting in the Foreing Legion, narrowly avert death several times, and end up saving the day with ample help from Abdullah and Nicole.This 1950 film, directed by Charles Lamont, was the 25th film featuring Abbott &amp; Costello, then in their 15th year as a comedy team.  The film suffers somewhat in comparison to Laurel &amp; Hardy's 1939 classic &quot;The Flying Deuces,&quot; but there are enough laughs in this one to make &quot;Abbott and Costello in the Foreign Legion&quot; at least an average comedy by the boys.  Of course, to be fair, Costello had faced a pair of serious illnesses, rheumatic fever and a gangrenous gall bladder, in the months before this film was produced.  The wrestling sequence remains the comic highlight of the film, along with the mirages the boys encounter in the desert.

Jackson is in it.The Caveman's Valentine is everything that I expected in the form of craziness and oddness, but it failed in my eyes in the directing department and the overall writing of the story.  2 Stars",The Caveman's Valentine
431679,"Musical theater can frequently delight you and occasionally move you but how often does it actually instruct you? &quot;Into The Woods&quot; has more valuable life-wisdom to impart than all but the greatest dramatic plays and novels. It's an amazing piece of work. (And the tunes are infernally catchy to boot...)That said, I'll indulge myself with a few trifling criticisms. Bernadette Peters sings well enough but she frequently panders to her &quot;theatrical&quot; fan base with campy line readings that may be good for a cheap laugh but instantly propel me out of the story. Chip Zien as the Baker is irritatingly nebbishy, using the same trembly-panicked inflection over and over again. And while you hardly need extras when the primary content is this rich, the absence of any DVD commentary from the extraordinarily gifted creators seems like a tragically wasted opportunity.",Into the Woods VHS
523553,"Although it seems it's been the most reviewed movie of 2000, I can't refrain from saying a few words in its praise. If you're not blind or from Mars, you must have seen this epic &quot;how a general became a slave, the slave became a gladiator, the gladiator who defied an emperor&quot;.The movie has been compared to Ben Hur and Spartacus (from which it drastically differs, having in common only historical background and costumes; as Star Wars of 1977 differs from Phantom Menace 1999; it has been compared to Braveheart (the latter being much more steeped in patriotism and historical inaccuracy). It has also been blamed for being theatrical (and it is) and pathetic (oh, thumbs up), and illogical (indeed, flight to Spain over hundreds of kms to save his family and this abduction of Maximus by slave-traders are, well, unconvincing.Its success has been cemented by three ingredients: R Scott's director's genius and talent &quot;to create worlds&quot;, R Crowe's colossal charismatic performance that as magnet glues your eyes to screen whenever he's in frame and CGIs. However, so much has been dwelt on their grandeur in creating the world of the Ancient Rome, that I'll skip this part. All the CGIs prove once more that still (and thank God), movies are held together and brought to fame by actors. R Crowe fits in perfectly (imagine someone else in his place now? Impossible!), he's of the new actors whose talent comes from within - you can rewatch some scenes for a dozen times only to catch change of emotions on his face or expression of eyes (exhibit 1: Maximus scraping off Pretorian insignia from his shoulder - mixture of choked up pain, hatred and wry humor; exhibit 2: last conversation with Commodus - mixture of hatred, defiance and surprise and many others). Well, I like him so much I'd spare you and save the extra-space of this site. Watch for him, he'll get his Oscar if not this year, then the next.The supporting cast is harmonious as well: especially J Phoenix: although his Commodus is a capricious spiled brat, but watch his royal profile and gait, contempt in cold eyes and hidden fear. C Nielsen as his sister is not less ambitious and powerful, only in a more subtle way (I'd bet she was the one to jilt Maximus, not the other way round). The music is opera-suiting, sounds in your brain long after the movie is over.The finale is ... well, the best you can expect from Hollywood. Pathos is towering to heaven, but still sends shivers down your spine and mist into your eyes. I'd ask happy DVD owners: has there been any alternative ending in mind?To sum it up, although I'm a VERY BIG movie fan, it's the first movie EVER that I've watched for 4 times during last 1.5 months. It's a treasure for your home collection.PS: My greatest fear now is that R Crowe will squander his newly minted stardom and huge talent on some brain-dumb movie. Greatest hope - maybe someone will dare to revive Spartacus or come up with story of Alexander?",Gladiator VHS
38202,"This is one of those movies you don't see often. It is not a normal movie like others, and it doesn't has a normal story.  The way of filming isn't normal either, and I think that real movie lovers will love this movie because of the beautifull way of filming and montage plus the very good score and songs which fit perfect in the film.The movie begins brilliant which shows right away that this isn't a normal movie. But you think it will be a comedy and it isn't.  Then, the first hour you will look at it wondering what happens and after the first hour you still don't have a clue where it exactly is about. But don't worry, everything will make sense at the end. The acting is also fantastic, from the prefect preformance of Tom Cruise as the sex-therapist to the boy genius. Everybody is great. I only didn't like William H. Macy very well, but that's just me.And well, the frogs... I think Paul T. Anderson means that symbolic and everything thinks different about it. One way to think at it, is that it is the plague of the Bible and after that, all the sins of the characters are forgiven and they can live again or die in peace (that's the way my mother thought of it).I think this movie is a must to see for all movie fans, and you will like it as well if you like strange and very deep movies.",N/A

I think I got the apple with the razor blade inside.  Some treat....I was under the decidedly mistaken impression I would be getting a martial arts flick.  Sure, I figured there'd be some augmentation with wires and such, but at no point did I expect the parody of a fantasy flick this ended up as.  However, even if I had gone in expecting a noncombative fantasy movie, I still would have been disappointed.At no point during this movie was I impressed.  I think even the Dungeons and Dragons movie was better fantasy, and you know just how bad that is!  The effects are silly (the bad guy kills people with magical soap bubbles), the acting is atrocious, and the storyline is the same hackneyed plot that's been sifting down through schlocky fantasy books/anime for decades.  I kept hoping for something terrible to befall the female love interest.  I kept hoping for scenes involving tentacles a la The Legend of the Overfiend.  This would have been the movie's saving grace, a fall into badness so extreme that it would have achieved the ranks of high comedy.Alas, it was not to be.(...)If you're looking for a good Chinese fantasy movie, do not watch this abomination.

48485,"Many believe that this was greatest work of a master renowned for the outstanding direction of suspense thrillers.  Alfred Hitchcock creates a vortex of emotion and deception in this classic film about obsession.There are so many complex themes to this story that it requires several viewings to appreciate.  It metamorphoses numerous times, shifting from a detective story, to a love story, to a murder mystery, and finally to neurotic obsession.  It is a deep character study of flawed characters.  Some are not what they appear to be and others change before our eyes.Hitchcock's direction is superb, not only from the standpoint of assembling the story, but from a technical perspective as well.  The photography, lighting and perspectives are brilliantly done and the locations wonderfully selected, especially the shots at the foot of the Golden Gate Bridge.  Hitchcock also brings forth outstanding performances from Kim Novak and James Stewart.  Stewart generally played admirable and heroic characters in his career, so the deeply flawed John Ferguson was a clear departure for him.  This is probably his best and most gut wrenching performance. I don't think it would have been possible without Hitchcock's direction, because Hitchcock was the master of bringing such characters to life.  Novak and Barbara Bel Geddes (most famous as Miss Ellie on TV's ""Dallas"") also give excellent performances.Bernard Herrmann's musical score is superlative.  It is beautiful, compelling and chilling and brought additional power to almost every scene.  Hitchcock had such great respect for Herrmann that he stated during production that whether the scenes of the film worked or not depended completely on the music Herrmann would write.  He trusted that Herrmann would create just the right mood, and he was correct.The DVD version presents us with a completely restored version of the film with rich color and powerful sound.  The new DVD is the only way to watch this film if one hopes to experience it the way it was originally presented in 1958.This film is ranked number 61 on AFI's top 100 movies of the century.  I rated it a 10/10.  It was virtually ignored at the Academy Awards garnering only two nominations for set decoration and sound.  However, it endures in the opinion of many as one of the best suspense thrillers ever made.",N/A
502528,"Being a fan of Truffaut and having seen such great movies of his as THE BRIDE WORE BLACK, THE 400 BLOWS, and THE WILD CHILD i expected this film to be as great but unfortunatly it was not as great as the ones i have mentioned but it is not one of Truffaut's worst either. It manages to make the cut because of great direction, cinematography, costumes, sets, locations, and most of all because of Isabelle Adjani's great and haunting performance, a performance for which she was nominated for the Academy Award for best actress and an award she should have won but which she lost to Louise Fletcher for ONE FLEW OVER THE CUCKOO'S NEST. She portrays the daughter of Victor Hugo, Adele Hugo (hence the H in the title). The story is based on true events which were recorded in a diary the real Adele kept. Adele falls in love with a soldier she met in France and soon after he leaves her and goes to Halifax, Nova Scotia. The movie begins by showing us Adele arriving in Nova Scotia and from then on we see her try to win her love back but he reveals he had no serious intentions with her and she becomes obsessed with getting him back. She has little pride and dignity and she does what she has to do to get him back and we see her suffer and through journal entries and letters we understand what she is going through psychologically. But for some reason the movie never becomes totally emotioanlly involving which is the problem. If it had it would have been a masterpiece. I think this might be due to the script in some way. But if not for Adjani this might have been a mediocre movie. You can't take your eyes off her delicate beauty. As Truffaut once said &quot;you could make a movie about just her face.&quot; Also look for a cameo by Truffaut as a soldier who runs into Adjani on the street.",The Story of Adele H. VHS
536070,"&quot;Hannibal&quot; was a pretty O.K movie except for the fact that Jodie Foster wasn't in it. As a southern woman, I must say that Julianne Moore had one of the worst southern accents I have ever heard before, and she didn't bring any justice to Clarice Starling. However, I did love the story, and I thought it was a good thriller. It wasn't necessarily what I thought it was going to be. When you say a name like Hannibal Lector you think of cannibal, but in my opinion he hardly did any killing, and those he did kill weren't killed in the fashion that I thought Hannibal Lector had become accustomed to. &quot;The Silence of the Lambs&quot; was a classic, but I guess you could say that &quot;Hannibal&quot; was a fairly good movie, certainly not one of the best though.",N/A
12907,"Yeah, it's silly. It's derivative. It's not the greatest (or even close). Still, I think a lot of people are missing an essential point in this film...IT'S A PARODY!!! It's a big joke, with running gags, lots of humor, fun characters, especially Broderick. Matthew Broderick is at his best when he looks like the idiot hero; he's self-effacing and lovable and that should be enough. They constantly mispronounce his name, followed by &quot;er...whatever&quot; and he's regularly referred to as &quot;the worm guy&quot;. It happens a lot. I'm a fan of running gags. That so many people took this film WAY too seriously may explain its failure. The extras on the DVD are good, especially listening to the uber- master Emmerich trying to sound like the expert (which he's NOT!). A bit disturbing to me, was to see NYC destroyed, yet there were some great aerial shots of the WTC. When one watches a goofy film like this, it's good to keep in mind that it's all fantasy. The aerial shots were glorious, and can live on, at least superficially, as a testament to the NYC skyline, as some of us knew it. The ones who don't like this film are the ones who can't find humor in the silliness of grand fantasy.",N/A

529118,"This is the rare instance where the director's post-release tinkering has improved what was already a fantastic film. Watching the &quot;Untitled&quot; cut (Director Cameron Crowe had such difficulty coming up with a title he almost released the film as &quot;Untitled&quot;) is like discovering long-lost chapters to your favorite book, or hearing outtakes from your favorite band. The additional scenes bring viewers further into both the hero's home life and the surreal life on the road of a touring rock band. The original cut of the movie is included in the set, but why anyone would want to see it after seeing this film in the longer form is beyond me.And the extras ... simply the best on a DVD I've ever come across. The commentary with Crowe and his mother is at turns insightful, touching and hilarious. The part where they discuss whether Crowe lost his virginity the same way his alter ego on screen did is worth the price of admission alone. The deleted scenes include one that invites the viewer to cue up &quot;Stairway to Heaven&quot; since that was supposed to be the soundtrack for the scene, but the rights was unavailable. The satisfaction of seeing the characters on screen react to your dubbing is incredible. And there's a bonus CD of songs by &quot;Stillwater,&quot; the faux band in the film. The songs are a great pastiche of 70s rock that heighten the believability of the film. You really think you're listening to a great undiscovered band from the time.As for the movie itself, the original film deservedly won an Oscar for best original screenplay and should have won more. Had more of Kate Hudson's performance as &quot;band aid&quot; Penny Lane been in the movie, she would have an Oscar today. Billy Crudup perfectly personifies both the innocence and the arrogance '70s rockers exuded, while Patrick Fugit's performance captures the uncool kid yearning to be cool we all were at that age.Put simply, if you even just mildly enjoyed &quot;Almost Famous,&quot; you owe it to yourself to give this a spin.

At 250 minutes between the five episodes that turns out to be quite a rib tickling time.  Readers of the Jeeve's novels are no doubt aware of the difficulties of reproducing Wodehouse's stories verbatim, but these chaps have made a bally good show of it. The stories that inspired writers like Douglas Adams, Ben Elton, and Richard Curtis (as well as the films of Blake Edwards) are done admirable service here. Hugh Laurie and Stephen Fry are every bit as funny as they are in Black Adder's tales. The scenery is authentic (since they filmed the series in England) and the supporting casts are wonderful.

572426,"Many of the more positive reviews seem to have been written by Israelis.  Unfortunately many of the qualities they found in this film will be completely missing in other people's experience.The average viewer who watches this film to either understand the incident or to gain some insight into the Isreali/Palastinian conflict will be disappointed. So will those seeking the vicarious thrill of watching a real life action-drama unfold.Much of the film attempted to appeal to the emotions of the audience dwelling on the personal tragedy of one hostage's family and to a lesser extent that of another. That did little to give purpose or coherence to the film. There was considerable padding with footage of the Olympics, in case you have no idea what goes on there, footage of policemen, people lounging, and what felt like 20 minutes of terrorists staring out of windows and doorways. It could easily be pared down to an hour and serve as midweek PBS fodder. The early 70's rock music in the soundtrack, chosen perhaps to lend period mood, was cheesey and extremely annoying.One positive comment I have is the movie explained some of the mystery behind the very bad performance of the German authorities. The greatest problem was lack of control (TV crews had free access allowing the live broadcast of an attempted police ambush which the terrorists were able to watch on TV) and lack of communication, both attributable to lack of training and appropriate organizational structure. The Germans at that time had no counterterrorist police units and their laws prevented military intervention. The police snipers had no radios, body armor or even proper sniper rifles.  One policeman was accidentally killed and another officer accidentally wounded.",One Day in September 1999

676457,"Moulin Rouge is nothing short of spectacular. With some of the finest costumes, cinematography, and art direction ever to be seen. The film is directed by Baz Luhrmann whom also directed the 1996 version of &quot;Romeo and Juliet&quot;brings his gift sense of style to this movie. This is not to mention a wonderful musical score which blends contemporary hits in a traditional musical style of presentation. The only flaw in this gem is the first ten minutes of the movie, which I did not know if I was watching a comedy or a serious drama. Yet once I found my self inside the Moulin Rouge I found that this was a heart warming romance, and a tragic drama. Ewan McGregor and Nicole Kidman give there best preformances in this film, even if the majority of there lines are present though music much in the style of &quot;Evita&quot;. The story of a young man whom goes to Paris to write a story of his ideals of truth, beauty, freedom and above all love leads him to a group of eccentric artists which ask him to write a play for them. This allows our main character the chance to meet the beautifull dancer Satine, whom is the main star of the Moulin Rouge and a prostitute. Yet there love is over shadowed by a jealous and insane duke whom holds the deed to the Moulin Rouge and there very lives. The film is rated PG-13 yet this movie should have been rated R for the strong sexuality, violence language and mature themes which include a scene of rape. This film is suggested for those sixteen and up, anyone under should truely view this film with their parents.

I liked it then, and since I've recently been reading the book, I decided to watch it again.A Harvard scientist is sent to Haiti to discover the secrets of zombification, after having undergone a hallucinatory encounter with the forces of evil in the Amazon.  Once in Haiti, he explores the underground world of Voodoo with the help of a psychiatrist contact.  He ends up contracting for a special zombi-making powder with the help of a Voodoo shaman.  However, a corrupt government official (also a black magician) discovers this and intimidates the scientist into leaving (after a harrowing scene in which he punctures his scrotum with a large spike, &lt;ouch!&gt;).  He leaves Haiti, but not before the Voodoo shaman who promised him the powder secures it for him.  Back in the United States, he discovers that the powder's effects are indeed promising.  (He intends to use this to create a new form of anesthesia.)  However, he is continually plagued with visions and nightmares involving his own death and burial and the corrupt black magician.  He decides to return to Haiti to confront this evil yet again.  In Haiti again, he is immediately taken by a friend who offers him magical help.  But, the evil magician discovers this and has the doctor sprayed with powder, turning him into a zombie himself.  He appears to die and is buried.  Another zombie hears his screams as he awakens from his agonizing catatonia in the graveyard and digs him up.  Finally, a revolution occurs in Haiti, and in a confrontation between good versus evil the doctor must meet the magician in battle, who now controls his soul.  This movie offers a bizarre interpretation to the phenomenon of zombification.  (Of course, for the scientific approach read the book.)  It is entertaining and worth watching.The movie has tried to capture something primal, and that is man's fear of the great beyond, death.  It leads us to ask the question of what is death and can death be conquered.  By far the most disturbing scene in the movie is where the scientist is buried alive with a tarantual in his coffin.  The idea of being buried alive is so horrendous that it operates on the nether-regions of man's unconscious.  This is what makes the scene so disturbing to watch.",Serpent & the Rainbow VHS

I see a lot that a couple people down the line of reviews could not see, could not comprehend.  One such reviewer is too hung up on the music.

536669,"Okay, maybe I'm crazy this way, but I _like_ &quot;The Mummy Returns&quot;. I love it, in fact. I found it to be a really, really good movie; I enjoyed it more than the first. (And yes, I love the first one, too)This movie is an _action_ movie; that's all there is to it. It keeps you on the edge of your seat the whole time. The special effects are a*maz*ing . . . I can't even imagine the small fortune they must have dished out for those effects. Almost every scene had something-or-other in CG animation.But that's not what made this movie so spectacular, really. All the computer generated effects in the world won't do any good if the acting isn't convincing. The actors, during filming, have to act afraid/angry/etc. at nothing but air; but if they act well, once the effects are added in, the result is nothing short of amazing. At the acting in this movie, especially when it was in response to really _nothing_ for THEM, was spectacular.(spoilers ahead) But there was also some real _emotion_ in this movie. The real grief on Evelyn's face when she is thinking about her kidnapped son; the anguish on Rick's face when he loses his wife; the affection parents and child all have for each other----this is an action movie, but these are real _people_ here. Kudos to all the actors for a job well done. And my favorite characters from the last movie were only heightened in my respect for them by this sequel----the brother Jonathan, who provides plenty of moments of comic relief but also gets to have some serious, dignified moments; and of course Ardeth Bay, the leader of the Madji (or Madgi, I really must look up t'at spelling sometime), who has some great drama sword-fighting scenes. I love Ardeth, not only because I have a thing for guys in black with swords *g*, but because, for lack of a better way to say it, he is not Bruce Willis. When he has a hoarde of ten hundred thousand warriors of Anubis pouring towards him and his band of a hundred or so Madgi, he refuses to run away, he stays to face it----but the guy looks a little nervous, okay?  Of COURSE he'd be nervous!  Wouldn't you be?  Kudos to the actor (Odin Faer, perhaps?  It escapes me right now) for giving this character not only bravery, but fear (which he overcomes) at the same time. It's about TIME we see a real action character for once.What about the &quot;in-depth&quot; stuff I was babbling about?  There isn't much time for a long slew of character development, but it is there. My favorite would have to be Evelyn, who becomes as much as a warrior as the rest of them in this film. I won't spoil by giving away the reason as to how she learned all this, but it is a good one. :) And Rick is told by Ardeth, who catches sight of a tattoo on Rick's forearm, that O'Connell is one of the Madgi himself. Rick, who has been running from responsibility to anyone but himself (and now, his family) for a long time now, refuses to accept what Ardeth is trying to tell him----that is he a warrior for God. He doesn't want to be responsible in any part for humanity----&quot;You've got the wrong guy.&quot; Ardeth tries to convince him a few times, &quot;If you embrace this, you will find peace in yourself,&quot; but that doesn't go over too well. :) It is resolved at the end of the movie, because Rick has a choice of whether to send Anubis's army back or use it to take over the world----and he takes no time in deciding what he really wants to be.So what can I say; the acting is great, the effects are great, and the kid (&quot;Are we there yet?&quot; -- &quot;NO!&quot;) is quite fun. My advice would be, lighten up, stop expecting this to be the next &quot;Star Wars&quot; (and quite frankly, I enjoyed this more than I did &quot;SW&quot;; I'm sorry, but it's true), and just enjoy it for what it IS, not what it is NOT. And you will probably find that this truly is quite a good movie. Enjoy.",The Mummy Returns VHS

269872,"Can you believe that &quot;Dark Night of the Scarecrow&quot; was a tv movie that came out in 1981? Since then its been rediscovered by millions of cable viewers at Halloween. The movie is set in a small rural town. Its a tale of prejudice and hatred and how it destroys lives. The movie stars Charles Durning as a hate-filled,child-molesting mailman named Otis Hazelrigg. Otis hates the town retard Bubba(Larry Drake) a 36 year old mentally handicapped man who loves to play with children. Otis convinces his three friends that Bubba is dangerous. When a little girl that Bubba has been playing with gets attacked by a dog, the town immediately blames Bubba. Otis and his gang form a lynch mob to track down Bubba. They find him hiding in a scarecrow in a field and promplty execute him by firing squad. Unfortunately they get a call seconds later informing them that the little girl is ok and that Bubba actually saved her life. The men stand trial for their crime but are let off for lack of evidence. Bubba's mother(Jocelyn Brando, Marlon's sister!) warns Otis that &quot;there's other justice in this world&quot;. From then on weird things start to happen. Otis and his friends start seeing the scarecrow everywhere and one by one they start getting picked off by strange &quot;accidents&quot;. &quot;Dark Night&quot; is an amazing movie. It has a great plot with some great acting by Durning and really the entire cast. Everyone in this movie fits their parts to a tee. It is simply a great story turned into a terrific movie. Everything in this movie clicks, it is indeed a rare and superb movie. It will probably be around for a long time because the movie stands up to multiple watchings. I highly recommend this film to anyone looking for a great movie.",N/A
344627,"Finally, two enjoyable Blake's 7 episodes running consecutively - meaning they are both on the same tape! &quot;Project Avalon&quot; and &quot;Breakdown&quot; are among the highlights of the series' first season - both are taut, suspenseful stories which plots that progress and develop. &quot;Project Avalon&quot; continues Blake's Robin Hood style quest against the Federation; this time he is coming to the aid of another high profile freedom fighter, Avalon. But she has been captured by Travis, and the rescue attempt begins. The fact that viewers have the foreknowledge that Travis is setting a trap for Blake, but are unaware of its exact nature, adds to the tension. While Stephen Greif's performance of Blake's nemesis is good, and his character firmly established, it is at this point evident he is the central enemy - he will be behind all plots, schemes and machinations and, because of the hero/villain rule, will never be successful. This is perhaps the only problem with Travis - the character's single-mindedness can only lead to &quot;single-plottedness&quot; as well. But this is not to fault &quot;Project Avalon&quot;. The atmosphere builds up as the story progresses, with the plot shifting between two halves: the &quot;action&quot; half, in which the task is to get into the complex and rescue Avalon. This includes walking through caves and corridors, a not very well realised shootout and the obligatory retreat and escape. In my opinion, this is the poorer half. Much better is the &quot;suspense&quot; half, after the crew escape in the Liberator. This is indeed suspenseful - the pace of the story has slowed down, but in its place is the creeping anxiety that something is not quite right - the true nature of Travis's plan will be revealed. &quot;Project Avalon&quot; is the kind of story with fast and slow moments, but the story is served better by the slower paced scenes, rather than the outright action packed ones. The following episode, &quot;Breakdown&quot;, is also played out in two halves, although neither are clearly divided between action and suspense. Blake is forced to face an interesting dilemma. A malfunctioning limiter implant puts Gan's life at risk - he will die if he does not get specialist medical treatment. But as the Liberator crew are wanted criminals, where do they turn? The two halves serving the plot make for a well balanced story - the first is the race against time, and journeying into the unknown, to find help for Gan. The second part of the story deals with what unfolds when they arrive at their destination. Unlike &quot;Project Avalon&quot;, this episode explores more character traits - Jenna's loyalty, as she will not give up on Gan; Cally's naivete and alien (almost child-like) innocence where she deplores restraining Gan, and Gan's ability to trick her into releasing him; Avon's motives and his preparedness to leave Blake. The episode also tackles the issue of neutrality - its feasibility and, indeed, whether it succeeds or fails. This is the cue for the always brilliant actor, and perhaps the biggest guest star in the series so far, Julian Glover. He plays the neurosurgeon Kayn, a member of a neutral space station, XK-72; Kayn is in fact a Federation sympathiser who informs them of Blake's presence. Glover plays Kayn with an icy coolness; a blend of arrogance and determination. One of the best moments of the story is when Blake threatens to destroy his hands; the other is after Kayn murders the station administrator - a long shot when the neurosurgeon stares at his own hands, reflecting on what he has just done. There is one irritating quibble with this story. Surely the crew of XK-72 shouldn't have to wait for the administrator's order when a plasma bolt is about to hit them? Surely it's not as bureaucratic as that? Arrrgh! However, it doesn't ruin &quot;Breakdown&quot;. Nothing can ruin either of these excellent episodes of Blake's 7.",N/A

It was an ok movie. Just OK. I think the plot of it is so generic that it offends people. The people I saw this movie with (they wanted to see it, not me) did not like it at all.

When I finally had the chance to watch it at home, I found I was actually excited about seeing it.  I can't say that it's a bad film.  It's good.  I think I just expected to much.  With so much talent in a film, it's hard to have low expectations.  These actors do an incredible job in their roles.  I did feel like Tim Robbins (The Player, High Fidelity) was not giving his all, but the rest of the cast was as on as ever.  Don Cheadle (Traffic, Boogie Nights) shows that he is one of the top talents working in film today.  Sinise (Forrest Gump, George Wallace) is great as always and Jerry O'Connell (Sliders, Jerry Maguire) does a good job as the younger crew member.It's not a bad film really, just not what I had hoped for with all these talented actors and a legendary director like DePalma (Carrie, The Untouchables).  If you see this on cable, check it out.  I don't think you will feel the need to own it though.",Mission to Mars
59062,"The subtitled VHS version of this film was a great introduction for me years ago when I was learning about opera. Despite the valid criticisms about some of Zeffirelli's cuts and embellishments, I still think it's a beautiful film, both visually and musically. It's great to have it finally available on DVD, in widescreen format.I do have a major criticism of the DVD however. Although there are regular subtitles in French, the English titles are actually &quot;Captions for the hearing impaired.&quot; This is the only option for English titles, so there are sometimes distracting descriptive captions on screen: eg. &quot;[Music Starts]....[Laughing]....[People Singing]....[Finale}&quot; One would think that Universal, an American company, would have provided standard English subtitles as well. (There were standard subtitles on the VHS version and, I would assume, on the American theatrical release.)The nice thing about subtitles on opera DVDs is that they can be used when one is learning about a new opera, but then turned off when they become intrusive. The English captions are adequate for this purpose and I would still highly recommend this disc for newcomers and opera fans alike.",N/A
280033,"The summation of ad man Clark Gable's reading of the riot act to soap magnate Sydney Greenstreet is just great in this a-one movie about the post-war radio advertising world. Gable has just hung up his uniform--literally--when the show begins, and is ready to resume his radio ad man career. Along the way, he has to tangle with Greenstreet, a really dopey Keenan Wynn, and decide which of two lovely ladies he wants to pursue. Quite a dilemma: the upper-crust war widow Deborah Kerr who seems like she'd be made of ice but is surprisingly warm to the touch, or sultry torch singer Ava Gardner, who might seem like a live wire but secretly yearns for an apron and a man in slippers.  For those who are as confused as Gable as regards the woman issue, have no fear--just check out &quot;Mogambo&quot; where once again Gable has to choose between a lady (this time, Grace Kelly) and a, well, not so much of a lady (Gardner again). See both movies together, and you can play out both scenarios.Really wonderful supporting work by Greenstreet as the overbearing soap dictator, used to making everyone alternately jump and grovel, and by Adolphe Menjou as the beleagured head of the ad agency, who has lost so many of his scruples that he embarrasses his wife in a terribly effective drunk scene in a nightclub double date with Gable/Kerr. Smaller role for veteran Edward Arnold, but just as solid as usual, playing a man who trusts Gable a little more than he ought.If you're in the mood for great post-war King Gable and a bevy of top-rate supporting players, make a bee line for &quot;The Hucksters&quot;--and that's no soft soap.",Hucksters VHS
452520,"What a waste.  Those were the words that echoed thru my mind as the movie ended.  What a waste of an outstanding Trevor Rabin soundtrack.  What a waste of the considerable talents of Jerry Bruckenheimer and Michael Bay.  Not to mention an all-star cast that includes Bruce Willis, Ben Affleck, Steve Buscemi and Liv Tyler.The fatal flaw of this movie is that it can't seem to make up its mind what it wants to be.  NASA locates an asteroid the size of Texas heading straight for the Earth, and everyone seems to think it hilarious.  After the laughter settles down, NASA hires a bunch of oil-rig drillers to go up and take out the asteroid.So, what we end up with is a movie full of slapstick comedy, combined with good special effects.  However, every once in awhile a sentimental, tender moment is stuck in.  Can you imagine someone trying to integrate a serious, emotional moment into a movie like ""Airplane!""?  No?  Well, that's what they did with this movie.  The result is nothing less than absurd.  And I won't even ask why NASA deemed it necessary to take gatling gun  into space with them.Don't get me wrong:  I'm all for fun movies.  ""Con Air"" and ""Gone In 60 Seconds"" are two of my favorite movies as far as pure entertainment goes.  It's just that there is something about the threat of an asteroid hitting the Earth and making the human race going the way of the dinosaur which seems incompatible with a slapstick comedy.  ""Deep Impact"" is a far superior movie;  it has the reflective moments minus the comedy.",Armageddon VHS

WE created God so he really doesnt exist,  thats why he's not in the movie - just a bunch of eccentric followers of his that are foolish enough to believe that he does indeed exist.

545042,"This Two-Disc DVD set is really an improved version of the VHS tapes released two years ago, but now include bonus live performances, an audio commentary from Mike, camera angle switching options and photo gallery.The cool thing about this DVD set is that it really underlines the potential for the DVD format in the area of instructional videos. For anyone who has used VHS to learn either an instrument or foreign language, you know how difficult it is to keep forwarding and &quot;bookmarking&quot; particular sections that you are trying to study. Nobody just watches a video from beginning to end while learning a particular subject. You will want to focus on sections, sometimes for weeks at a time. With the DVD format and chapter breaks, it's simple to do and frankly makes any instructional VHS tape obsolete.The next fascinating thing about the DVD is the audio commentary. Already there are over 3 hours of playing and instructional information, but with the audio commentary on, you get a behind the scenes view of what it takes to make a video like this. One interesting tidbit was when Mike was talking about how a particular drum sequence was so difficult to get right in one take, that they actually took several different takes of him playing and spliced them together! You would have never guessed this unless you had the commentary on. The other great thing about it is just the ease at which Mike talks to the viewer and lets them in on all the details of being in a working rock band. He tells interesting stories of tours, recording sessions and drum technique. All of this is extremely interesting to practicing musician who just can't hear this stuff enough.Another technology introduced on this DVD is the multiple camera angles provided in certain sections. Mike is known for his use of double bass work and being able to fix the camera on those sections that are difficult to the viewer is invaluable!In conclusion, the DVD set is a MUST BUY for any musician hoping to improve their chops or just be entertained by the amazing drumming of Mike Portnoy. My girlfriend, who isn't even a musician, let alone drummer, actually enjoys just watching the DVD because of the great music. There is so much to this deep and useful instructional video that you will continue to view it for years to come.",Mike Portnoy:  Liquid Drum Theater VHS

This is exactly what one might expect.  Atrocious acting by a somewhat talented and recognizable cast,  TERRIBLE snake effects, but a satisfying amount of gore, and &quot;leave you hanging&quot; non-sex scenes.  All in all, it was a load of fun and it was great for late-night viewing.  I had a fun time with the over-the-top performances and seeing the results of the snake effects.  There was very little nudity but be warned:  Those expecting to see Jenny McCarthy in the buff will be sorely dissapointed.  My only complaint was that one character i liked got killed and Keith Coogan, (Brad from adventures in Babysitting and Cheetah) who is billed in the opening credits, doesn't show up until the end for one speaking part and it is after the snake &quot;problem&quot; has been resolved.

193450,"Two scientists investigate mysterious attacks by ants - not the overgrown ants in &quot;Them&quot; or a host of weaker rip-offs, but normal everyday ants that just happen to band together and short-circuit computers, clog up exhaust vents, gum up the gears of any mechanism, etc.  In short, instead of growing big and stupid, these are ants that look normal but act very smart, testing the wits of two scientists sent to determine what's going on.  From a mnostrously sized nest (for ants anyway), the ants lay seige to the geodesic dome covering the scientists' lab.  Surrounding it with light-reflecting pillars, the ants bathe the dome in heat, raising higher than the computers within can stand.  With the ants outsmarting man at every turn, the scientists' defenses soon run thin (the ants learn how to immunize themselves against insectocide), wearing away their material and emotional reserves, and forcing them to take one last desperate measure.

332286,"No science fiction film has been more successful in portraying mankind's potential space-borne future than &quot;2001: A Space Odyssey&quot;. It is still among the most realistic portrayals of how human exploration of the Solar System may unfold. Sadly, that exploration has not kept the pace envisioned by Stanley Kubrick and his collaborator, noted science fiction writer and visionary Arthur C. Clarke. The film is based on Clarke's early short story &quot;The Sentinel&quot;, a science fiction literary classic. Those who pay heed to negative comments by previous reviewers will miss a genuine cinematic masterpiece replete with vivid imagery and great special effects. Keir Dullea and Gary Lockwood give credible performances as the American astronauts aboard the USS Discovery, though the finest performance is by the actor who is the voice of HAL (HAL 9000, the Discovery's computer.). Incidentally, &quot;Star Trek&quot; fans will remember Gary Lockwood for his portrayal of Lieutenant Commander Gary Mitchell, the ill fated first officer of the Starship Enterprise and friend of her captain, James T.

Thank god that finals are over...oh, sorry back to the movie.Well, i agree with the overall consensus, this movie is quite good.  I was exceptionally skeptical due to the trailors i had seen, but the customer reviews swayed me to take a dive, and i did, and i enjoyed the swim afterwards.  This movie is more story than martial arts.  it has fighting in it, but if youre looking for a kick and punch thriller (what i kinda enjoy) then this may not be the movie that will satisfy your appetite, however, it will impress you nonetheless.It's quite an interesting story about two young martial artists from opposing clans that fall in love, they meet, they fall in love, they vow to love one another, they do, and then something happens.  what you ask?  well, watch the movie, i wont ruin it anymore than i already have. haha.It's not cheesey, although i was expecting it to be (remember i took a dive).  Although, i have a complaint about the unnecessary nudity in the film.  there was one scene that showed some naked woman wearing a mask, yeah, not your typical martial arts studio activity (i havent seen something like that,and ive been involved with MA for 12 or so years).  but its a movie, so if youre planning on watching this with your children, don't!  it only occurs one time, but my other complaint was with the sex scene in this movie.  no nudity here, just acting, but quite explicit. so if youre easily offended by this type of material, you have been cautioned.the story was honestly pretty good, the acting was also very good.  I got the DVD copy, so i didnt have any problems with blurriness, i thought it was a pretty good translation (picture and sound quality wise).

Maybe they play better when I'm drunk or something. On to my reviews.The first Superman on DVD. This is a great movie with plenty of extras. But there is a flaw. Warner Brothers did not provide the original edit of the movie. Sometimes this is not a bad thing. Many of the other DVDs I own offer up two seperate edits of the movie &amp; I usually select the longer take. But I probably would have made an exception for Superman. There are 2 inserted scenes that I had problems with. The first was early on in the movie where the council sends a guard to arrest Jor-El. The guard goes on his way &amp; disapears. Undoubtedly he was killed en route when Krypton blew up, but it felt like a hanging plot point. The other problem scene takes place after Superman reveals himself to Metropolis. A certain tone &amp; pace is established in this movie at that scene which is thrown off by a sudden cut back to the Fortress of Solitude where Jor El counsels Superman on the importance of maintaining a secret identity. It isn't a bad scene, but it throws off the pace of the movie. The commentary track by Richard Donner &amp; Tom Mankiewicz is informative and makes me wonder how much more wonderful Superman II would have been had Donner been allowed to complete the picture. Apparently they had filmed Marlon Brando's scenes for the movie &amp; for reasons I will never understand, those scenes were excised by Richard Lester. It made me crave a completely alternate edit of Superman II. I would also like to have seen the original ending for Superman I which was also discussed in the commentary track.Superman II. Great fun. Effects aren't as good as the first Superman, &amp; the disc is woefully light on extras. One can also see camp elements at times threatening to overwhelm the picture, particularly when the three villains are blowing at the citizens of Metropolis. Scenes like that didn't bother me before, but annoyed me here. Maybe I'm getting old. Still the movie carries on quite nicely from where I left off &amp; is highly satisfactory as entertainment.Superman III showed the Salkinds getting desperate with their franchise. Or maybe they just didn't know how to manage it. The camp buries all sense of adventure &amp; wonder in the first two films. The only way they could have excused such silliness is if they had made the villain Mr. Myxlptk or whoever the little irritating imp is in the comics who turns up to harass Superman every now &amp; then. That would have provided an excuse for scenes involving walk &amp; don't walk street lights getting into a fight with each other. Margot Kidder was written out of this movie because she protested the firing of Richard Donner during Superman II. I hope she laughed in the Salkind's faces after they released this one.Superman IV: The Quest for Peace. This was the first time I actually sat all the way through this movie. It has lots of problems, beginning with Superman saving a runaway subway train when the driver suffers a heart attack. Lois Lane is on the train &amp; when it speeds up she is the only one screaming for help. The other passengers are jostled a bit but nowhere near the panic that Lois is displaying. That is very out of character. Then, when Superman stops the train, he actually keeps some rescue workers from getting to the injured driver so that he can deliver a short speech on the safety of Metropolis's subway system. Not so super. Scriptwise they were about 4 drafts away from something presentable. In terms of special effects, this is diametricly opposed to the first Superman movie. The special effects in Superman I were great with one or two bad effects shots. In Superman IV the effects by and large were bad with one or two good effects shots. And why did they have Nuclear Man take Mariel Hemingway into outer space? It was a very very stupid scene. It would have played better if they were just high over the city. Yet all in all I am satisfied by this set.",N/A

443672,"In typical Tarrantino fashion, another multi-leveled, many charactered, in-your-face display of people doing what they need to do when extreme situation call for action, Jackie Brown is another masterpiece. Sadly, it did not receive all the hype and promotion as did the his previous work, Pulp Fiction, but like many things, that has little bearing on the greatness of the film. In a smart, savvy, sexy performance, Pam Grier smolders with brains and wit as the title character trying to get her life back on track. With great support from Robert DeNiro (looking very disgustingly dirty and dirtbag-ish), and absolutely amazing Robert Forster (a bail bondsman with a heart), Samuel L. Jackson (love his attitude!), and a very annoying (but in that &quot;good&quot; sense) Bridget Fonda. I hesitate to give away anything about the plot as much of the pleasure you will get from this film is watching the plot unfold, point by point. Just trust me on this one, you will see things you wouldn't expect, and things you do expect will be done in ways which will blow your mind. Sure, expect lots of violence, sure, expect lots of foul language, sure, expect some sex...this is Quentin Tarrantino...what do you expect? If you object to that content, then don't see this film. If you realize these are standards in Tarrantino's work, then you'll see far past this, and see the great work for what it is: good writing, and superb acting.

38343,"This film centers around a number of seemingly-unrelated characters in seemingly-unrelated situations, yet every one of these characters' situations has something in common-- none of this film's characters are portrayed as containing any sort of redeeming value. The director and screenwriter would not have you believe that the characters here are evil, but Magnolia's perspective on humanity is very negative.Throughout this ungodly long film you will see these characters in pain, in misery, in desparation, crying out but not being heard, needing help but not receiving it; and all the while, no rationality is given as to why we, the audience, might want to see so many miserable people in pain, suffering, even dying. The dialogue here, and the direction, is reminiscent of other films that have previously been hailed as thought-provoking films, and so many may mistake this as a thought-provoking film, speaking of its powerful message about society. But this film has no message. This film has no point. If this film has any point whatsoever, it is that one man can write a meaningless, dry, miserable story, and make it look intelligent through intelligent presentation; and for this he will receive critical acclaim, even Golden Globe awards, all because today's audiences are too stupid to realize when they're being mocked.For Magnolia is a mockery. It mocks its characters, it mocks its audience, and it mocks other films that manage to entertain by providing a pleasant and/or complete resolution. I commend this film on its success, for it has managed to prove its point: film audiences and critics alike know nothing about storytelling, only about what they are expected to appreciate. But in the end, this is a miserable film, one that I cannot recommend to anyone.For fans of the film, though, this DVD is an excellent package. Considering the film's length and the inclusion of more than one audio track, the quality of the transfer is very good, if not excellent (there is some artifacting at times). More importantly, though, a second disc is included which contains a number of interesting extras, including a seminar done by Tom Cruise while in character.",N/A
432068,"This DVD is something great.  Not only do you get commentary from writer/director Kevin Smith (&quot;Clerks&quot;, &quot;Mallrats&quot;) but also Ben Affleck and some of the producers.  In the commentary I was intrigued with what Kevin Smith had to say about his favourite scenes, the score, why he cut certain scenes and each of the actor's performances.  The Criterion Edition of this DVD is packed with extras which include trailers, commentary, deleted scenes &amp; outtakes, an introduction by Kevin Smith, etc.Ones of my favourite scenes is the emotional blowout between Holden (Affleck) and Amy (Adams) in the arena parking lot.  Joey Laura Adams is simply exceptional.  In the commentary Kevin Smith can't stop blabbing over Joey Lauren Adams' performance being a &quot;tour-de-force&quot; and it definitely is.  In this scene she gives every ounce of energy into her performance.  I would have to agree with Kevin Smith in saying that the most powerful line is that scene was &quot;No !  I used them !!&quot;  You have to watch it to know what I'm talking about.Ben Affleck and Jason Lee were very good as well.  Ben Affleck's performance had some many powerful subtlties.  Jason Lee was very effective as his comical bestfriend who holds in a lot of deep hostility, jealousy and anger due to his own personal issues that he has trouble facing.  Jason Lee won the Independent Spirit award as Best Supporting Male for his performance.  Joey Lauren Adams performance was nominated for Best Actress in a Comedy or Musical at the Golden Globes that year.  She certainly derserved it.

664897,"The two men racing to break Babe Ruth's single-season home run record in 1961 were about as different as they could be.  Mickey Mantle was the rock star of the Yankees, beloved by fans, living fast and hard, while Roger Maris was, as the film puts it, &quot;at best, a very good player,&quot; but also a reserved, everyday family man.  It seems almost incongruous that the one to break the record was the last one everyone expected, and &quot;61*&quot; suggests, not the player the public wanted.The film is excellent at portraying the building tension of the season, as Mick and Maris, the M &amp; M boys, battle against each other for the record.  But director Billy Crystal dispels the myth that Maris and Mantle were at odds with each other.  If anything, the film shows that their greatest enemy was the press, who mercilessly play up any misstep by the withdrawn, non-charismatic Maris.  Baseball commissioner Ford Frick is also depicted in a less-than-sympathetic light, as a stodgy old-timer who wants to preserve the Babe's record at any cost, a desire that manifests itself in the asterisk that appeared after Maris' record until 1991.Unlike their forebears, Ruth and Gehrig, Mantle and Maris are portrayed as having a very supportive friendship, devoid of competition.  They share an apartment together, and Mantle helps Maris through the daily press barrage.  Although Crystal is ostensibly a huge fan of baseball and Mickey Mantle, he does not shy away from the less-savory details of Mick's personal life, his womanizing and reckless living that even he admitted stunted his career.  It really makes a fan wonder what could have been if Mickey Mantle had taken better care of himself.But, as the film progresses, it become less about Mantle and more about the unlikeliest of heroes, Roger Maris.  Barry Pepper not only looks enough like Maris to be his brother, he nails the conflict and torment that he faced when shoved into the limelight, turning Maris into a sympathetic, complex character.  Thomas Jane may not have Mantle's sweet swing and powerful physique, but he shines at portraying Mantle's fun-loving, live-for-today attitude, as well as his own inner struggle.  His wisecracks add much-needed levity to a film that could have been mired in its own self-importance.Sports-themed films that hark back to the glory days of a sport often take on a mythic aspect that often rob the film of its honesty.  &quot;61*&quot; embraces the myth but doesn't eschew the honesty, resulting in what is arguably a much more rewarding film.",N/A
385078,"This movie was entertaining to watch. I liked a lot of the details and concepts presented in the story, even most of the acting was all right. The storyline seemed to be fairly well developed although there were a few flaws. I did like the talk of satellites years before anyone really had them (especially the proposed satellite with a TV camera and transmitter) and the science stuff (even if it was technobabble). Our guys shot first, asked questions later at first contact all because they didn't understand the first attempted message, something that has turned up in other stories since then. In this case they were right to shoot, which is a switch. The alien ships appeared all over the world then converged on Washington D. C. for the final battle, I'd call that a low budget solution for a way to end the war. Our weapon would probably kill the operator but who knew that in 1956?

566470,"Come on people, the cinema isn't perfect these days. Very rarely do we get gems these days. Yet, most of the stuff that is being put out is certainly entertaining. And although a large majority of people do not have this movie on their list of entertaining ones, I do. Bless the Child, I think, contains a well thought out story of a young girl who was sent from God. A Satanist who has been searching for her will stop at nothing to make sure he turns her over to the devil.The good stuff: Some of the acting. The little girl who plays Cody, Holliston Coleman, was actually very good. Her character never once annoyed or bothered me. She can deliver some strong lines. &quot;After you.&quot; Yeah, I know, it may sound corny to some people, but while watching the movie and what happened before she said it, kind of chilled me. Christina Ricci did well here. Her character was used to get Kim Basinger's character closer to finding Cody, but wasn't used enough. I really wish they would have broadened her character. It was also nice to see Jimmy Smits put back on the &quot;cop / detective&quot; routine. Although this is labeled as a psychological thriller or what have you, there are jump scenes and gore. The jump scenes were pretty much non-effective in some parts, but in anothers, it worked well. I didn't even expect the gore. Yes, there are decapitated heads and knitting needles through eyes here. It surprised me.The bad / fair stuff: Um, Kim Basinger really didn't do well here. In her other movies she's been in, she is awesome, but here? She rarely gave a convincing performance. The ending is pretty much where she shines. Rufus Sewell, who was Eric Stark - the villain-  did okay as the Satanist Eric Stark. But he wasn't that much of an intimidation with his actions. Although his performance really never dulled.  I felt as if the beginning of Bless the Child was a bit rushed, but after that, the movie settles into the basic plot, and rides from there. It's not a quick ride. I do admit, sometimes it dragged, but it never lost my interest.The DVD's video and audio transfers are pretty good. The colors are done very good. The only supplements on the disc are an audio commentary (Which I have yet to catch), theatrical trailer, and interviews. Would have been nice to at least seen a featurette of some sort.In the end, Bless the Child isn't top Hollywood material, but it's interesting none-the-least.",Bless the Child
24054,"For the many fans of the book &quot;Memoirs of a Geisha&quot;, &quot;Sisters of the Gion&quot; is a treasure of a movie. Released in 1936, it was intended for an audience who daily lived similar lives to the ones onscreen. Thus, for the casual Western viewer the actions &amp; social conflicts it presents may seem strange. To someone who wants to see what daily life in the Gion quarter of Kyoto was like in the mid 1930's, it's a gem!&quot;Sisters of the Gion&quot; opens with an auction of household items. We are told they belong to the merchant Furosawa who has gone bankrupt. Mr. Furosawa then abandons his wife, child &amp; faithful clerk to go stay in the Gion residence of Umekichi, a geisha to whom he had been patron. Umekichi lives with her more modern sister Omocha. We know she is more modern from the first scene she appears in, as she wears Western fashions as opposed to the kimono worn by her sister. Omocha is not happy they will be supporting Mr. Furosawa &amp; gives Umekichi a lecture on geisha economics; she believes men are only as good as the size of their wallet, &amp; has no use for a man who can't support them. The rest of the short movie (66 minutes) follows Omocha's plots to secure herself &amp; Umekichi wealthy patrons &amp; the emotional devastation she wreaks in the process. Of course the final scene shows her having been punished for her pains, as was expected by the conservative moral climate of the time.What will prove fascinating to the viewer who has read &quot;Memoirs of a Geisha&quot; is the minutiae of daily life in Kyoto during this period. The original viewers in 1936 took the street scenes &amp; shots of domestic life as a given, but to modern eyes it is astonishing to see the tiny corridors that passed as streets in Gion, the platformed tatami rooms with tea braziers &amp; ubiquitous long-stemmed pipes smoked by all the characters. The few traces of European influence (large cars, fedoras, Omocha's dresses) slam jarringly into the timeless framing of bare rooms &amp; kimono clad women.There isn't a building higher than two stories evident in any outdoor shot, &amp; merchants still visit customers homes to thanks them for their patronage! An early scene even shows the sisters walking down a street, stopping every few steps at shrines to clap their hands in homage, all without pausing their conversation! Truly, a world which vanished irrevocably at the end of World War II!Honestly, &quot;Sisters of the Gion&quot; gets it's 4 stars as an anthropological artifact, not as a movie. But to anyone interested in daily life during this period of Japanese history, it is an invaluable record.",N/A

572124,"This dark mystery/thriller begins well enough, but it gets increasingly implausible until by the end it loses most of its credibility.  Crystal Ball (Natasha Henstridge) walks into a second hand bookstore owned by Sam Kane (Angus MacFadyen) ostensibly to apply for a job.  Upon leaving, she is hit by a car.  Sam takes her to the hospital and cares for her while she recovers.  The impact causes her to lose her memory, so she doesn't know who she is or where she lives.  The two fall in love and then Crystal suddenly remembers that she was sent by Merv Gutman (Peter Fonda) to kill Sam because Merv thinks Sam stole money from him.  The film goes through a number of gyrations including confrontations between Crystal and her boyfriend Tommy G (Liam Waite), Crystal and Merv, Sam and Tommy G, Sam and Merv, Crystal and Sam, etc., etc.The plot has a few interesting twists, but the dialogue is banal and many of the scenes drag.  However, for a film made on a $3.5 Million budget, director Darrell Roodt delivers some excellent photography and shows himself to be talented at creating powerful imagery.If there are two things that stand out from this film, they are the talents of Roodt and Henstridge.  Roodt gives the images style and richness with interesting perspective shots and a number of beautiful location shots.  I'd like to see him get a more prominent project where he can put his talents to work.  Natasha Henstridge carries the film with an excellent performance that should portend a shot at meatier roles in the future.  Her striking appearance and superior acting ability is made even more obvious playing against journeyman Angus MacFadyen, whose performance here helps validate his relegation to supporting roles throughout his career.  MacFayden is stiff and forced, contributing little to the believability of his character.  As mediocre as MacFayden is, Liam Waite is worse.  Peter Fonda gives a nefarious performance in a minor role.This film isn't bad for a B movie and shows twinkles on the horizon for Roodt and Henstridge.  I rated it a 6/10.  With a stronger screenplay, it could have been very entertaining.",Second Skin

I felt like I was watching a cheesy horror flick (like Scream). The movie had a very bad turn when the husband arrived. His arrival was utterly pointless and went on for a boring 30 mins. Finally the movie got back on track. The ending was not a big enough payoff for the hour and half of creaking floors, slamming doors and horrified gasps.

Sad to say, Mr. Damon, it wasn't so fun to WATCH Thornton's finished product. ""All The Pretty Horses"" is like trying to interpret someone's bad dream, all scattered images and unintelligible action thrown together in a two-hour video.  It is obvious in the first 30 minutes of ""ATPH"" that integral parts of the film were cut to fill a specific time frame. Enormous amounts of footage that would've made the film more understandable and perhaps even more enjoyable ended up on the cutting room floor due to squabbles between Thornton and studio execs.  From what would've been a potentially long film (almost four hours, to be exact) it was severely sliced down to a mere 116 minutes by the hacksaw editors at Miramax and the film suffers greatly because of it.The story is as follows: John Grady Cole (Damon) is a young man in late 1940's Texas who dreams of living the life of a prosperous rancher.  He is determined to see and experience the old frontier before it disappears for good and makes a plan to travel to Mexico on horse with his good friend Lacy Rawlins (Thomas).  On route, they meet tough-talking teen Jimmy Blevins, a young fugitive traversing the desert landscape on a stolen horse.  He leaves the entourage only days later, dodging authorities for a second-theft of the same nature.  Sans Blevins, John and Lacy cross the border and find work taming wild steeds for a man named Rocha, the most prestigious rancher in the area.  Trouble brews when good ol' John falls for Rocha's beautiful daughter Alejandra (Cruz).  Despite the tumult that their interracial relationship will cause, they begin seeing each other in secret and fall madly in love.  About fifteen minutes after John and Alejandra are officially an item (it occurs so quickly - it's almost implausible), he and Lacy are detained by the local captain for murder and meet up with Blevins again when they are thrown into a filthy cell with him after their arrest.  John and Lacy do time in a Mexican penitentiary (don't know how long; hard to tell) and Alejandra is completely out of the picture for the next hour.It's at about this point in the movie that people who have not read McCarthy's novel will be thinking, ""What's the hell's going on here?""  They have good reason to ask this question, for nothing makes sense because of Thornton's massive amount of missing footage (probably about an hour and a half's worth, if I carefully judge).  What will really boggle people is the relationship between John and Alejandra.  The dialogue between them is too insubstantial and vague; their wordless exchanges aren't nearly enough to justify their instantaneous love affair.  In a matter of minutes, John and Alejandra go from perfect strangers to voracious paramours, a tangle of limbs beneath the sheets.  You don't see any emotional growth to their relationship.  Instead, it's...BAM - they're in love!  Cruz's Alejandra is reticent one moment and in the next moment knocking on Damon's bedroom door every night for a romantic rendezvous. Even their love scenes are shown in jump cuts, each shot of them kissing and embracing only seconds long.  Fade in, fade out - and that's the way it goes.  There is no insight to gain for their sudden chemistry and their heartrending romance.  Of course, this is due to the faulty editing that is so apparent throughout the whole movie.Many other defects stand out to the ardent observer.  For example, Henry Thomas and Matt Damon look not the least bit rugged in their travails across the border.  There is not a millimeter of stubble visible on their baby faces, even after several days in the rough and unforgiving terrain of Texas and Mexico with no hygiene whatsoever, not to mention an arduous stint in a filthy and fearsome penitentiary.  They remain clean-shaven through it all. Not very realistic, if you ask me.It is hard for me to critique most of the performances in this film because of all the missing pieces, but I will say this: Lucas Black RULED the screen.  Black was the high of the lows and a welcome spark to the extensive and languorous shots of the Mexican range.  Cocksure and completely resolved to keep both his horse and gun to his minute list of possessions, Black's strong-headed Blevins is a spunky refresher when someone becomes bored with John and Lacy's dreamy trek across the border.Despite its greatest flaw, ""All The Pretty Horses"" still manages to come off as a striking and meaningful piece of work from a progressive director.  I sincerely hope that within the next year, Thornton releases a director's cut version on DVD so that audiences predisposed to shunning this insufferable edition will get a chance to see Thornton's original and complete vision before the production axe came down with a loud and deadly crack.",N/A
62357,"If I were still an adolescent, I'm sure I would absolutely love this movie.  It is filled with loads of silly, gross-out humour, swearing, and lots of sexy women gyrating in skimpy outfits.  Sure, I do still get guilty pleasure out of such things but, alas, I am no longer so easily amused.  On occassion I did find the humour in this movie as laugh out loud funny as anything in &quot;Airplane!&quot;, such as Ernest Borgnine's performance of &quot;I'm Too Sexy&quot;, but such scenes are too few and far between.  This is disappointing because I am a fan of the creators' work on South Park, but with the exception of the brilliant opening lamenting the current sorry state of professional sports, this movie lacks their usually strong satire, making it little more than a pale imitation of Zucker/Abrams/Zucker movies.The plot consists of Stone and Parker, unsatisfied with the commercialization of sports, creating a new game which in reality would be absolutely boring to watch except for the fact that players can do almost anything during the game to distract their opponents from sinking shots (this is where most of the gross-out humour comes in, which takes up about a third of the film).  Of course an evil businessman wants to commercialize Baseketball and to do so has to turn Stone and Parker against each other.  Meanwhile the two are also competing over a busty volunteer worker from a Make-a-Wish Foundation style charity.  Predictably, they wind up having to bury the hatchet and win the championship in order to preserve the &quot;integrity&quot; of their game. Most of the ensuing humour is along the lines of Stone and Parker taking one of the dying kids out to a bar to get drunk.  Not a bad time waster, but not really worth collecting.",N/A
239229,"&quot;Mary Poppins&quot; has been around so long that it is hard to review objectively. I saw the film in the movie theatre in 1980 when I was 14 years old, and all my expectations were surpassed. There is so much to love about it, it's hard to analyze it without evoking sentimental memories of childhood.While not quite in the same caliber as &quot;The Wizard of Oz&quot;, yet much better than &quot;Chitty Chitty Bang Bang&quot;, the movie does have irresistable assets: a lovely score, great sets and costumes, as well as infectious acting, singing and dancing by all the leads. The movie itself is somewhat episodic, with no real tension or conflict (unlike the tense and scary scenes of conflict in &quot;Wizard&quot;), and is about 45 minutes too long for contemporary audiences (1960's audiences didn't have short attention spans as they do today, and lumbering musicals could just take their own sweet time). Despite the accolades regarding the film's special effects, some of the blending of live-action and animation is just not on par with Disney's earlier classic &quot;Song of the South&quot; (1946). Even the wires used to fly Mary and her cohorts are sometimes glaringly visible, especially on a great DVD print, not to mention in the movie theater. Perhaps some of these shortcomings caused the film to not receive mention on the AFI's 100 Greatest Films list. Nevertheless, &quot;Mary Poppins&quot; is a bona fide Disney classic, with a wonderful message about life and family.",N/A

559813,"As a Nick Hornby fan, I read &quot;Fever Pitch&quot; and found it to be very masculine. It was organized much like the sports page--match by match, sort of a statistical chronicle of Arsenal over several decades. The film, on the other hand, centers on the personal life of the football fanatic (closely based on Nick Hornby himself) and provides much more balance and intrigue.The match-up of the serious, somewhat humorless female English teacher and the passionate-about-football but about little else male English teach is enticing. She wants to learn to loosen up and connect with her students and their parents the way she perceives he does, and he wants to be with someone attractive with backbone and spark. As played by Ruth Gemmell and Colin Firth, you see why these opposites attract and you also see why they conflict.Despite the provocative cover, I don't see why this film is rated R. Language, maybe, and adult ideas? The sex is tame and modest, although there is an out-of-wedlock pregnancy. Still, I think this would be as good a film for the teenage sports fan as it is for adults. How passions conflict (in this case, between love and sports fanaticism) and how compromises and resolutions can be made is a worthy topic to address and is well answered in this film.",N/A

No matter how great the film is. Jim is great in this. This film shows yet again how versatile and comedically brilliant he is and can be. His character is the most sympathetic one he's ever played. His three sons is another great comedic idea. That can't be said for Rene Zellwegger. She's good, but doesn't do enough. There is some things in here that would of been better if left out.

428681,"We now have August of 2001, and I'm already angry at myself that I'm only getting around to seeing this 1985 milestone AIDS film today!  I work in the television industry, and I must say that I feel proud that a major network like NBC had the guts to produce a film this sensitive and revolutionary for its time.  It truly makes a valiant attempt (and succeeds for the most part) to make AIDS an every-day, living room topic without ever getting too sticky or maudlin about it.  Even though this was really in the stone-age of AIDS, it's amazing how right-on it was in so many areas.  The only thing that feels dated now, is the lack of therapeutic possibilities, which we have today, but my God, we just all lived through 20 years of Hell, and only now - recently - have a shimmer of light at the end of the tunnel.  The writing team had great insight and foresight.That said, now the silly TV producer side of me needs to have it's say:  I wish that the script had gone one round with a good dialog doctor.  There are moments, where - despite the AMAZING cast - that I did have to cringe.  It was always a matter of sticky dialog, but - believe me - not the heart, soul, or deeper truth of the piece.This film might be somewhat old, but it is still incredibly valid, and is heads-and-shoulders over most films of its genre.  I'm sure that the executives at NBC who gave the green light for this production are long gone, but I raise my glass to you for your courage and for your vision.

224064,"After the stylistically flat, albeit somewhat entertaining, Part 5, the Friday the 13th series roared back to life with what is arguably the best movie in the series (albeit one cut to shreads to receive an R rating).Tommy Jarvis (well played by Return of the Living Dead star Thom Matthews) is still suffering from hallucinations and violent outbursts as a result of his killing of Jason in 'Final Chapter'.  Enlisting the aid of a buddy (Horshack from Welcome Back Kotter of all people), Tommy heads out to Forest Green (formerly Crystal Lake) to dig up the serial killer's corpse and completely destroy it and, hopefully, his trauma for good.  I guess a different body was mistakenly cremated in Part 5.  Things go bad when an electrical storm reanimates Jason's corpse and the now killer zombie strides off into the forest to look for victims while the guilt plagued Tommy runs to get help for the quite understandably disbelieving police.While writer/director Tom McLoughlin's script is witty and self-deprecating in tone, and some of the jokes are pretty good, it is nonetheless more of the same.  However McLoughlin does give this series entry a strong visual style - something almost all the others lack - Jason standing atop a crashed motor home being a good example.

Never a dull moment, although the slapsticks do occur - &quot;Puff the Magic Dragon &quot; and all the cranky jokes on Focker's name - makes it entertaining and accessible yet not crude. The director Jay Roach (AUSTIN POWERS) sits back prudently to watch the two leads steal the show with their effervescent chemistry. Never mind the plot - just watch the two male actors enchant.

319624,"Directed by Michael Curtiz, this film focuses on the symbiotic relationship between southern planters and their tenant farmers or sharecroppers. It was, inevitably, a relationship fraught with conflict and was a social issue that this film sought, in some measure, albeit melodramatically, to address. It was an issue that would later be more eloquently addressed by the classic film &quot;The Grapes of Wrath&quot;.&quot;Cabin in the Cotton&quot; is representative in style of a cinematic effort that still showed the transition the film industry was making from silent films to talkies, as it has some of the stylized accouterments representative of a silent film. It begins with the written word from which the viewer gleans the context in which the movie is to be viewed. The leading male role, that of Marvin Blake, the sharecropper's son, is played by Richard Barthelmess, a noted silent film actor. Unfortunately, he plays it as if he were doing a silent film, down to the painted lips that he sports in some scenes, a la Ramon Navarro. Why he sports these painted lips in some scenes and not in others is somewhat puzzling. Moreover, his acting, while perhaps impressive in a silent film, is notably unimpressive in a talkie. He is clearly miscast as the sharecropper's son who rises above his station in life and becomes the love interest of the plantation owner's southern belle daughter, fetchingly played by Ms. Davis.The story is simple. Sharecroppers are taken advantage of by the planter who keeps them as virtual slaves. Sharecroppers look to get back at the planter. Sharecroppers steal from the planter in an effort to balance the books, so to speak. The planter seeks redress for this. Marvin Blake, the sharecropper's son who got an education of sorts, is now the planter's right hand man. Caught in between the divergent interests of the competing groups, Blake is forced to come to a decision about what he is to do to reconcile the two groups, both of which are clearly getting out of hand in their efforts to win for their side.Blake should have been portrayed by someone for whom the viewer would root. Unfortunately, Barthelmess does not cut it. He is, at times, laughable, at other times, contemptible and simpering in the role. He makes the viewer want to give him a swift kick in the can. He does not demonstrate the qualities of which leaders are made and that is a quality demanded of his role.Bette Davis, on the other hand, is wonderful as Madge Norwood, the attractive daughter of the planter whose sharecroppers are bedeviling him. She is vampish, seductive, and beguiling, as the love interest with whom the hapless Blake is totally besotted. She plays Blake like a violin, and he falls for her like a puppy dog for its mistress. This, of course, breaks the heart of a sharecropper's daughter, who loves Blake wholeheartedly. To see who triumphs, watch this film. It is a must for all Davis fans.",N/A

There are so many nice bits like the running gags about the store lights and the name of the band.  But the things that make you fall in love with the film are joyful touches like the first time the band's song is heard on the radio.  You can't help but feel happy right along with them.

580857,"I've been a fan of Taylor Hackford's since the great Devil's Advocate.  However, Proof of Life is not up to par with DA.  In my opinion, and I base this on the fact that I am in fact a practicing screenwriter, Proof of Life contains some of the most trite, worthless dialog I've ever seen.  But it is given with such conviction by David Morse and Russell Crowe that they sometimes make it fly.  I myself have written a film based on a magazine article, so I know how hard it can be to complete the amount of research that is needed to pull something like this off, and more research is exactly what was needed to help get this film truly moving.  After a brilliantly staged opening, the film moves off by trying to show how much knowledge Tony Gilroy thinks he has on the K&amp;R subject.  However, it never takes off and ends up being stuck in fourth gear and not shifting into overdrive until the absolutely amazing climax.The action scenes are extremely well done, and this is thanks to Hackford's great eye and not Gilroy's script at all.  By trying to create the tension of a romantic triangle, the film pulls away from the action that it could've had and joins the other &quot;Almost&quot; films that could've been brilliant, but never quite made it.  After seeing a sound byte that called the film &quot;Casablanca with firepower,&quot; I was psyched to see how this was done, but nothing never really meets this expectation.  Whole parts of this film are lifted straight out of Casablanca and you can tell that Gilroy was really trying to prove he was original and smart.  However, the parts that everyone will notice feel cheap and detract from the film.If this had been a straight action film, it could've been really great, but instead it gets stuck in mediocrity in its own pretentiousness.  The performances are very good, especially Crowe and Morse, but the only actor that is truly annoying is Meg Ryan as Alice.  You can tell that the filmmakers were hoping that the off-camera romance between Ryan and Crowe qould help fuel what happens on screen, but it doesn't really matter because the scenes involving the blossoming romance come out of nowhere and feel completely out of place.  If this film had better cohesion and pacing, it could've been a monster of a good film.  Instead, it slips into that &quot;okay&quot; state that crushes so many films of this kind.",Proof of Life

Russell Crowe performance is astonishing, you can actually feel the torture that this man went through -I loved Kevin Spacey in American Beauty, but I think Crowe is fantastic here, well, they gave him the Oscar for Gladiator, to compensate. The documentary-styled photography makes the movie even more gripping.I loved Lisa Gerard's music, by the way, solemn and dramatic, and finally redemptive, when Crowe's character's battle is finally over.",N/A

In Endless Waltz, the implications are that the &quot;customized&quot; Mobile Suits were referred to as if there was no previous version of them. Here are some examples about different MS:(Tallgeese III): &quot;It's THE TALLGEESE!!&quot; (Wing Gundam Zero Custom): Tell Quatre to send the WING ZERO over here.

532479,"I think the assorted reviews here show that Unbreakable is a movie you'll either love or hate. As a confirmed comic geek, this movie was a dream come true, and the DVD even more so. It is a movie that treats the mythology of the superhero with the reverence and respect ignored by almost all the big budget comic-book adaptions.The problem is most people aren't comic geeks. The mixture of gritty realism with the notion that a man can be born with super powers may seem like oil and water to those who've never heard of &quot;Watchmen&quot; or &quot;The Dark Knight Returns.&quot; When I saw this movie in a theater, I distinctly recall the audience moaning and groaning at certain scenes, especially those involving Samuel Jackson's character. Many people I talked to afterwards also complained. I think what they fail to realize is that while Jackson's character seems surreal or worse, corny, it makes perfect sense. Quite simply, he's is a guy who's read too many comic books. To me, he doesn't seem corny or out of place at all. In fact, I think it was one of Jackson's best perfomances, and one of the top five of the year.The pacing also proved trying to many. I know a few people who even walked out on it. People hear &quot;super-hero&quot; and they expect punches to be thrown immediately. Granted, the pacing can be a little slow at times, but I never said the movie is perfect.From a technical standpoint, Night does an incredible job. His bizarre perspective's and subtle use of color and sound are extraordinary. Like &quot;Sixth Sense&quot; it requires several viewings to absorb. The performances, while understated (excluding Mr. Glass of course) are very genuine.The second DVD included with the set contains some really great stuff. This movie had some of the best deleted scenes I've ever seen on a DVD. I also enjoyed the 20 minute feature on super-hero's and comics. It was awesome to see Will Eisner, Frank Miller and Dave Gibbons talk shop in a documentary format. I only wished it was longer. Maybe they'll include more in the sequel (Hope, hope, hope.)So, while the movie isn't perfect, it's definitely worth seeing. If you can't get into the whole comic book angle, maybe you can relate to the ultimate theme of the story: finding your place in the world. While this may not be a traditional story of good and evil, it is a story of a single man's potential, for good or ill.",Unbreakable
175521,"I was one of the many who first saw 'Supergirl' during it's theatrical release, and were stunned into disbelief by plotholes you could drive a TRUCK through, some really bargain basement FX, and acting that ranged from sleepwalking (O'Toole), to blandly sincere (Slater), to 'Mommy Dearest...The Sequel' (Dunaway). While the film wasn't QUITE as horrendous as 'Superman III' had been, it came close, and the critical and audience reaction soured the Salkinds on the entire 'Superman' franchise (they passed the torch to Golan/Globus, with Christopher Reeve taking on much of the production duties for 'Superman 4'.)It is surprising, therefore, that the Special Edition 2-Disc DVD is amazingly good! Loaded with extras, it gives the viewer an enlightening glimpse at the behind-the-scenes work that creates a motion picture, from the casting (Slater was a charming, unpretentious girl of 19 when she won the role, and you can see her 'grow into' the part during the filming), to the tension on set (Jeannot Szwarc was not the easiest man to work with, and you can see him 'age' during the long shoot), to the marketing of the film (trying to revitalize a franchise that was already past its prime). 'Superman' expert Scott Bosco puts the film into perspective, noting its many flaws, but also acknowledging that there were good points, as well (there was a ballet-like quality to Slater's flying scenes, as well as her exuberance at having superpowers). Best of all is Szwarc's commentary...while he acknowledges that the film didn't turn out entirely as he had hoped, he was able to make it a more personal film than Richard Lester had, in his 'Superman' efforts.The viewer is given two versions of the film to choose from; a slightly lengthened theatrical version, and a 'Director's Cut', with a lot of extra footage that never made it to the theatres.While 'Supergirl' has never achieved more than a campy cult status, the Special Edition DVD 'set the bar high', and showed the industry what 'Special' meant. If you are a fan of DVDs that really give you your money's worth in extra features, this will be a very welcome addition to your collection!",N/A
247070,"Yes folks, America was then, and is now, as corrupt as we all think it is.  Preston Tucker, as portrayed by the film, courageously tries (and fails) to defy big business and big politics to follow his dream of building a gorgeous, brilliantly engineered, truly revolutionary car.  He's a modern Howard Roark, not bothered by what others think, attacking any obstacle put in his way, pursuing his own ideas at any cost.  There's a great deal of truth to the auto industry colluding with politicians to squash him rather than fairly compete with him.  I'm suspicious though, that the true motives of he and his business partner, a convicted bank defrauder (deftly played by Martin Landau) to sell stock and dealerships, was underplayed by the film to maintain Preston as hero.  The film manages to move along briskly throughout, with great imagery and a tightly-integrated, 40's-ish score, and doesn't sell out to any unnecessary romantic stories to get ladies into the theatre.  All in all a very good film, worthy of several viewings.",Tucker--The Man and His Dream VHS

Yes, the plot relies on actions by innocent guests that could never have been planned for, making it almost impossible to guess what actually happened, but the ingenuity is still a delight.

119423,"Batman Beyond: Return of the Joker (BB:ROTJ) has proven to be a great work in the animation world.Not only has this spin-off proven to be a worthy successor to the venerable original series, despite strong resistance from purists, and not only did it keep all the Batman mythos and atmosphere, despite being set in a more futuristic Gotham City, but it has showed great craftsmanship in story telling. The story is much deeper, with hidden surprises from beginning to the end. From tragedy to suspense to drama, this one delivers. Note however that the movie, even in its edited form, might still be a little too intense for the very young...The animation in the movie is above average, using much more involved screenshots and camera angle. Although the movements are not ""Disney-quality"" smooth, it is much better than what is showed on television.The soundtrack is excellent. Where the television series only used techno-rock as background music (which was still very good), in this movie, they used a very successful blend of orchestral and techno-rock music. The result is a much richer, grander atmosphere surrounding the story. You'll also notice that the orchestral music takes centre-stage during a ""flashback"" sequence, showing the original Batman, Robin and Batgirl.I have seen some clips of the original un-edited version, and I must agree with at least two re-edited clips that were redone for the final version. These new scenes actually were more dramatic than the original, dealing with the ""death"" of two characters. The original version of these scenes might be considered as ""too-ordinary violence"". Now, I won't elaborate so not to spoil too much the story, but I believe that the hoopla around the re-edition of this movie was greatly exaggerated.But yes, there were some scenes I wished they kept, since that would explain some oddities that sneaked into the edited version. My example is a fight scene between the Joker and Batman. In the edited version, Batman is stunned and weakened by ONE punch from the Joker, despite having pinned the Joker to the wall. Just one lousy punch. Well, the original version actually showed the Joker holding... a hidden knife. Well that explains everything. And yes I do believe that the original version is much more intense, psychologically, than the final edited version.But to say that the final product is but a shadow of the original work is largely exaggerated. This is good animation matched with a good story.The DVD version comes with a good documentary, a trivia game, a music video, one pre-production, very intense deleted scene, and interesting movie-long commentaries from the creators of the movie. It also comes with trailers from different other movies.As a DVD movie, it is a good bundle----------------------------------------UPDATE: The UNCUT version is available at the end of April, 2002!  I guess somebody pushed VERY hard to get it out.  I heard even Mark Hamill (Joker) was displeased that they cut a lot of stuff in the edited version.  Anyway, this review concerns only the edited version.  I shall review the UNCUT version seperately once I get it.",N/A
476145,"It's hard to give a bad review to a movie that you have grown up with. I believe that nothing could of lived up to Star Wars fan expectations. Expectations were simply just too high. The first three Star Wars movie were great, but not critically acclaimed since, lets face it, some of the dialog was corny. But at least there were great characters that you could love.  With Phantom Menace the biggest let down is the lack of great characters. In the original movies you have a more threatening villan. In Phantom Menace, Darth Maul seemed like he was just thrown in the movie for the light saber scenes. The only character i did enjoy was Senator Palatine, he was the only one in the movie that seemed to have the dimension, and intelligence that the characters from the original movie had. All the other characters, especially the annoying Jar Jar Binks, were not as likable as the original cast...although he seems to be the most memorable character from the movie just from the fact that everyone hated him so much.Great, ground-breaking things were done with special effects and animation in this movie. It seems too much attention was put into being 'state-of-the-art' and not enough attention to story lines and characters. The original Star Wars didn't have all the digital gagetry that this one had but still told an interesting story. Some other things raise questions also, like the huge age difference between the Queen Amedala and Anakin Skywalker!After watching and loving the Original Star Wars trilogy it is hard to totally hate this movie. As far as classic sci-fi motion pictures goes i think maybe George Lucas should have left well enough alone and just be known for three great movies. But i think that no matter how bad his movies are we will still watch them and buy them just because we are addicted to the Star War legacy...even though the long wait for the release of the DVD version is a blantent attempt to get more of our money, after already buying the VHS version.",N/A

345748,"It is to the credit of this film that so many people thought that it was a true story, although in the commentary track on this DVD, director Tobe Hooper admits that the date shown at the beginning of the film (August 18, 1973) was a few weeks in the future at the time of production.  The film simply works.A true horror film is difficult to come by these days.  Many filmmakers go for satire and pop-culture in-jokes.  That's fine, for what it is, but there is still an audience for a film that is designed to scare and disturb.  This one fits the bill perfectly.  First, it does not have a slick Hollywood look or feel to it.  As others have said, it has a certain documentary quality, which lends to the realism and believability.  Also, it is absolutely relentless in its single-minded attempt to disturb its audience, which is precisely what a proper horror film should be.For this DVD edition, the film has been restored to its original widescreen format, which makes more of a difference than one might think for this type of movie.  Also, the commentary track is very entertaining (which is something that cannot be said for such tracks on all DVDs) and informative.  For fans of horror or good independent films, this is a must-have that has been given its due in this superb DVD.  Highly recommended.",N/A

His performance as Sid Vicious was stupendous, while Chloe Webb was believable as the strung out Nancy Spungen. I am not a fan of drug abuse movies, but somehow this film and Trainspotting held enough of a deeper draw to keep me watching.

I am neither one so with that said let me begain.The set up:In October 1994, three student filmmakers disappeared in the woods near Burkittsville, Maryland, while shooting a documentary... A year later their footage was found.The footage is edited into the movie:The Blair Witch Project follows a trio of filmmakers on what should have been a simple walk in the woods... but quickly becomes an excursion into heart-stopping terror. As the three become inexplicably lost, morale deteriorates. Hunger sets in. Accusations fly. By night, unseen evil stirs beyond their campfire's light. By day, chilling ritualistic figures are discovered nearby. As the end of their journey approaches, they realize that what they are filming now is not a legend...but their own descent into unimaginable horror.Now, this movie did give me some chills but the overall fear facter when watching this movie is close to none.  The end and some of the sound FX will give you the willies but nothing more.  No big jumps.  Hardly any blood.  This movie goes back to the roots with sound, isolation, and darkness becomes scary, and it works.  When this movie is over turn off all the lights or go outside in the dark, you will be freaked out.So I figure in the end this movie works, it does what its sopossed to do.  The hype might was to much for this movie so people feel let down when it came out.  I suggest for everone to watch it once.",Curse of the Blair Witch VHS

At the beginning of the movie we're slowly moving threw the story while the credits continue on, helping the anticipation on the coming story by cinematic-great John Carpenter, who also directed Hallowee, Escape From New York, and perhaps my two favorites, Big Trouble In Little China and They Live. The story tells of gooey-green son of the devil in a tube where he eventually, turns one of the character's into a horror film-baddie. One-by-one the characters are turned into more horror film-baddies. And the humans that are still themselves duel against the forces of evil until a great near-finale, and an also great finale that is of Carpenter-tradition.

Granted, not as much as the 1975 original classic, but this second installment in the series had some very scary and tense moments of its own. The helicopter being eaten by the predator was a bit much, but still interesting.I thought the group of young people assembled to form the cast of ""Jaws 2"" did a darn good job. Reactions to the situations facing them seemed genuine, in my opinion. And the dialogue used by the writers seemed to fit 1978 standards.

It seems that Jason Voorhees is very much alive, and avenging his mother's death is very much on his mind. I guess mental illness doesn't skip a generation; we have slashings, stabbings, impalings, and a garroting until plucky and resourceful Ginny (Amy Steel), a child psychology grad student, meets her match in the deranged boy/man which leads to another heart-stopping finale.First-time director Steve Miner has a tighter direction with this sequel, with improved (or at least believeable) dialogue. Carl Fullerton handled the special effects this time as Tom Savini declined, citing the reason that he disagreed with making Jason a ""live"" character. This time the MPAA came down harder, and 47 seconds were removed at their request. Suspenseful, scary, and paced well. Jason looks suspiciously like The Phantom Killer from 1976's ""The Town That Dreaded Sundown"".

I loved the movie because of the gift she received when she died and the fact that she could help so many people who were in so much pain, I think it would be wonderful to be able to do something like that.  Only one thing that made it not true to life in my opinion is her language she used, and the affair she had right on her Dad's property.  I do not feel that God would give such a gift of healing to a non-christian, immoral person such as she was.  One of my favorite parts was the last healing of the boy.  She had a gift she should have cherished.  She was even allowed to heal herself.  She should have done nothing to jeopardize the gift.

What JAWS did for the beaches, DUEL for the highways, and PSYCHO for motel showers, ROLLERCOASTER does for amusement parks--turns them into places where absolutely no one is safe.George Segal is quite good as a cynical civic inspector looking into two very suspicious amusement park ride &quot;accidents.&quot;  He soon comes into phone contact with a young man (Timothy Bottoms), who is actually perpetrating these accidents to extort one million dollars from the owners of these parks.  The result is slowly escalating suspense leading to a very tense conflict between Bottoms, Segal, and an FBI team headed by a very cynical agent (Richard Widmark).Boosted by Lalo Schifrin's often sinister Herrmann/Stravinsky-like score and James Goldstone's efficient direction, ROLLERCOASTER isn't the disaster movie it is often pegged as.  Rather, it is an unjustifiably overlooked movie that deserves a revival.  Look for a very young Helen Hunt as Segal's daughter.",Rollercoaster

I saw it 3 out of the 4 opening weekend days it was playing!  I love this movie.  The plot you can follow and the cast is great in roles which could seem somewhat silly at times.The most pivotal thing for me in this film is REAL actors doing REALLY good kung-fu action/fight scenes!  Keanu Reeves, Laurence Fishburn, Hugo Weaving, and Carrie Ann Moss all spent 4 months training with one of the best martial arts directors in cinema history.  It shows!  The fight scenes are amazing if they do suffer from a bit too much wire work for my tastes.There is also the stunning visual effects utilizing a brand new method of film making.  They have to be seen being put together in the documentary on this disc.  Also a key on this dvd is the white rabbit feature which allows you to see how certain scenes were filmed and put together.There is a not-so subtle use of green through out the film, aside from this is one of the best films of 1999.

187279,"Michel (Guy Marchand) falls in love with Jewish refuge Lena (Isabelle Huppert) at first sight and offers marriage as a way she can avoid being sent to a German concentration camp.  She accepts, and although she doesn't love him, they have two children and are still married when we pick up the action again in Lyons in 1952 when Lena is 29-years-old.  There she meets the sophisticated and well-to-do artist Madeleine (Miou-Miou) who awakens her to the drabness of her existence as a housewife with a loutish husband who now runs a gas station.  The attraction between Lena and Madeleine is very strong, and very threatening to the men, especially to Michel.Huppert's poignant and bittersweet portrayal reminds me of her delicate work in Madame Bovary (1991).  There is the same listlessness expressed along with a vague desire for something better out of life, and the anticipation of the sadness that we know will come of such desire.  Miou-Miou is sharp and cynical with perhaps a streak of the manic-depressive about her.  The love they spontaneously feel for one another is real and beautiful and makes us want it to be fulfilled.  But Lena holds herself back because of her family, and then it is the men and propriety that get in the way.Of course this is very French and Lena and Madeleine hold hands and comfort one another while telling each other their innermost secrets including the infidelities of their spouses, etc.  (The men have no such communication.)  Director Diane Kurys exercises more restraint in showing the physical nature of their mutual attraction than would be displayed today.  Lena says to Madeleine at one point, ""I want to kiss you,"" but we do not see them kissing.  The most explicit scene sexually is the startling, but delicately expressed, meeting with the soldiers on the train where we discover the full extent of Lena's frustration.This is not quite a great movie.  The pace is a little slow in spots and sometimes the focus is not as sharp as it could be.  But it is an extraordinarily honest movie, and I'll take that over sharp technique any day.  Huppert is not only at her best here, but her exquisite and subtle beauty is shown to great advantage.  Miou-Miou is also very pretty of course--this is the first time I've seen her--so I would say her strength of character is perhaps her strongest suit.  This is a human tragedy on a small, intimate scale, one that we can't help but feel could have been averted had those involved understood one another better, had they been a little wiser.  We've all been there before and so we can share the sadness and the sense of loss.--Dennis Littrell, author of ""Cut to the Chaise Lounge or I Can't Believe I Swallowed the Remote!""",Entre Nous English subtitles  VHS

Although I hadn't gone to see it  in the theaters because it was a &quot;kids&quot; film, I had &quot;broken down&quot; and purchased the DVD on the recommendation of a friend's daughter (Grace, aged 8 years), and loved it.  So did the friends with whom I watched it at Thanksgiving.As with any successful comedy, whether cartoon or human driven, the story has various layers to it, appealing  in different ways to different age groups.  For those of us who have grown up on works like Monty Python, Saturday Night Live and other irreverent fare, the punch in the eye to standard fairytales is enjoyable.  (Early on  Shrek tears out the &quot;and she was awakened by true loves' first  kiss&quot; page out of his book in disgust and uses it as toilet tissue!)  Younger children will probably love the cute little donkey character, young girls the Zena like princess, young boys the mud bath of the ogre, etc.As usual, Eddie Murphy does a superlative job as the &quot;annoying, miniature beast of burden.&quot;  As with his little dragon character, Moushu in the Disney film Mulan, he is both dear and slightly idiotic at the same time.  He has all the genius for delivery that Robin Williams exhibited in Aladden, but brings with it his own style, a  more direct and more connected sense, that one finds in all of his work.  His was by far my favorite character.  I hope he does lots of other voice over parts like this in the future; he's truly gifted.Mike Meyers is the real surprise, at least to me.  I've only seen bits and pieces of Austin Powers in trailers and was not impressed.  When I was told that it was he who played the central character Shrek, I have to admit I was impressed.  Maybe CGI characters are his forte!One of the facits of the work I liked best was the clear message--lost entirely, I might point out,  in the Disney version of Beauty and the Beast of which Shrek might be considered a modern day version--that happily ever after, love, and happiness do not come packaged in a pretty or handsome face.  Although the Disney movie pointed out that, as the old adage has it, &quot;handsome is as handsome does,&quot; it botched the works by changing the beast into a handsome prince as his reward for being a person worthy of love.  Any school dance wall-flower knows for a fact that this never happens.  Shrek makes it clear that, while a person may not be what the rest of the world considers attractive, they are beautiful as long as the one they love sees them as so.  In fact, the movie makes several points important for adults as well as children to learn.The visual effects of the film were impressive.  The hair, facial affect, and movement of the characters was very real.  The movements and habits of the little donkey kept reminding me of my great danes Courageous and Tempo.  Expressions on faces created a sense of person and mental and emotional content that most cartoon characters lack or can only approximate by physically &quot;aping&quot; human behaviors.  The humans were not quite as real as some of the central individuals  in Final Fantasy, for instance, but the fact that they had to interact with totally make believe characters in a believable manner, made this less an inadequacy and more a means of promoting the story.  In fact, the facial affect of those in Shrek were far superior to Final Fantasy despite their overall less &quot;real&quot; appearence.  Probably the most impressive innovations in the film were in environmental design.  Many of the effects were very realistic, even more so than the much awaited monument to CGI, Final Fantasy.The double DVD edition, in addition to providing the wide screen and the pan and scan versions of the film,  has several special features.  My favorite was the &quot;out takes,&quot; that is the computer bloopers that produced bizarre results.This is definitely a wonderful addition to a family library of videos or DVDs and would make a lovely holiday gift for almost any age group.",Shrek VHS
447512,"I watched this video for the first time over a year ago, and I have to say that it could have been a LOT better.  I'd like to state a couple disavantages to this DVD that could have been prevented:1)  I don't know which TV the glasses included work best for.  They didn't really work for mine.2)  The sound editors used the same sound effects over and over on almost every ride.  I say, that can be irritating.  You'll know what I'm talking about when you see this.3)  The quality of the video isn't quite perfect either, at least on a few coasters.  At least they didn't show the whole ride on Kumba from front row.  Overall, the video is average.Overall, this DVD is OK; still recommended for hardcore coaster fans.Well, God Bless!",N/A
276165,"Gotta confess: I've never cared much for silent movies.  The pancake makeup, the googly eyes, the permanent waves, the heaving sighs--they never did anything for me.  But _The Crowd_, surprise, surprise, just so happens to be the best movie I've seen this summer.  The simple human tale of waves of dreams being dashed into spray on the cliffs of New York satisfies the viewer far more than the latest computer FX ever could.The film has its own remarkable special effects, achieved mostly through clever framing.  The scene with 12-year-old Johnny ascending the staircase is a masterpiece of the use of the lines of perspective.  The camera panning over to the adult John at his desk totting up columns of numbers, in a vast room with other men doing the same thing, is a great evocation of anonymity.The story itself is streets ahead of silent films from just ten years previous to it.  It has its share of pathos and melodrama-the plot twists at strict right angles--but a surprising element of ambivalence pervades the film, too.  The plucky young go-getter gets the girl with little effort--no Bluto to overcome.  But his hard work and winning personality don't win him the brass ring, either.  Instead, as he drifts further down into the anonymous mass, he finds reasons to count his blessings.  The film ends with everyone having a good laugh--for tonight.  This is not the stuff of _Rescued by Rover_.  Quite an experience.",N/A
41132,"Many of the reviews of this Highlander DVD claim it is terrible quality and is unwatchable. I think that is highly exaggerated. This DVD was not made with much care, especially when it boasts a THX remastering (i guess Lucas's team slacked on this one). But it is not that bad. I found it very watchable and only noticed some fuzziness now and then. The soundtrack isn't done that well (the dialogue is too low and the music by queen is too high), but this really isn't that big a deal. Unless you're a hardcore Highlander fan i doubt you'll notice or care about any of these faults. This was probably the cheapest DVD i've ever gotten (it was like 7 bucks), and for that price it was well worth it. Sure, it's not made as well as it could have been, but it's also not as expensive as it could have been either. The quality is good enough and its faults are really not that bad, it is certainly worth the low price.",Highlander: Director's Cut
43112,"What makes this one of the best programs ever to watch on your DVD:- Facts are real, has plenty of information about what probably is humankind`s greatest achievement. The mix of real footage and amazingly created ones add to its real life/documentary spirit. But it`s far from being a documentary, although every fact is real. It goes beyond on the narration.- It`s not ""Americana"" on its spirit. Mr. Hanks and his team deserve merits for showing this great achievement as a mankind victory instead of an ""America only"" feat. Congratulations!- Each episode is presented thru an original point of view, not the one you`d expect. This gives new life to the facts. The Apollo 13 episode, for example, shows how an anchor man from a TV network faced his drama at the same time as the astronauts. A great achievement since if it was presented the other way it would fail when compared to the movie. Actually, one complements the other.- Many generations have not lived the man on the moon. This is the best way to give them a small feeling of what that meant. It`s the closest an historical document can get to emotion. Anyone will learn great and funny facts from the Apollo project and its missions.- Episodes are very successful in passing the feeling of this great achievement. You`ll be proud of it, specially if you happened to be alive when it happened. At the end you`ll regret the fact that today we (humans/nations) spend too much time and energy with small problems that don`t take anyone anywhere.- On the latest episode you`ll learn that one of the century`s ""greatest"" men was, actually, the first pirate whose actions screwed up the life of the first great filmmaker.- Mr. Hanks talents go far beyond acting. Congratulations!- Acting is amazing, direction perfect, screenplays compelling. You won`t believe this was ""just"" a 12 episode TV miniseries. It`s FAR better than many movies made on science fiction/space exploration genres.The only point where they`ve sleeped:- The box and its opening ""book"" scheme doesn`t feel it`ll be up to date when man reaches Mars.I`d like to remind you all that this is not a science fiction miniseries. Its focus is on the spirit, the challenge, the emotions, the technology, the men and women involved on taking the man on a voyage from the Earth to the Moon.It`s not cheap. But worth every cent.",From the Earth to the Moon
414352,This is a very good early score from Jerry Goldsmith. It is very sensitive and reflective on the relationship of blind girl (Hartman) and black man (Poitier). Goldsmith received the 1965 Oscar nomination for this score. A good album.,A Patch of Blue VHS
660773,"This movie is essentially the same story as George Pal's &quot;The Seven Faces of Dr. Lao,&quot; i.e., mysterious stranger comes to town, offers downtrodden residents insight into whatever ideals Hollywood is pushing this year, is opposed by the forces of conservatism, yadda yadda.  The main difference is this movie is not portrayed as a fantasy, and we are expected to regard the heroine's role as the chocolate fairy hawking her medicinal goodies with absolute seriousness.  If you can do this (and some will do it more easily than others) you then have to look past the cliched, cardboard characters; the ultra-conservative religious civil leader, the degenerate wife beater, the crotchety old dowager with a secret heart of gold.  Once that is done you must look past the blatantly predictable storyline, plot &quot;twists&quot; you can see a mile off and &quot;symbolism&quot; that hits you with the subtlety of a sledgehammer.  If you like Johnny Depp (which I do), be prepared to see his talents wasted as his understated character serves two purposes 1) to serve as a downtrodden misfit whom the heroine can befriend and prove how politically correct (i.e., &quot;good&quot;) she is and 2) to provide a sex scene, which all modern movies must have, because &quot;how can there be love without great sex&quot; asks the modern scriptwriter.After doing all this I concluded that &quot;Chocolat&quot; was an entertaining date movie, but not in any way great art, or even a great film.  See it sometime when you're not feeling too critical and you will be fine.  or better yet, watch &quot;The 7 Faces of Dr. Lao.&quot;  The original is still the best.",N/A
513100,"&quot;The Shop Around the Corner&quot; is a film about people.  Simple everyday people, and just how colorful they can realy be. That romance plays a large role in the lives of people is, as far as this film is concerned, of no coincidence.  Set around Christmas, &quot;The Shop Around the Corner&quot; makes a wonderfully festive film, although it does not deal with Christmas directly.  But as Christmas brings out both the best and worst of people, it could not be a better stage for this delightful and touching film.  In the hands of a great director a depression ridden Budapest becomes a soft, charming heaven on earth.  And two &quot;psychologicaly very confused&quot; people become the luckiest on earth.As it is nearing the Holidays, please, do not pass up this film.

535963,"When Hannibal was eating his way through theaters earlier this year, I thought to myself &quot;I can't wait for the DVD!!!&quot; I live for the behind-the-scenes stuff, so I was dying to find out how the filmmakers accomplished the effects...Gary Oldman's Verger makeup, the pigs, the climactic buffet scene....so did the DVD deliver? Pretty much. The deleted scenes were very good, and I was especially pleased to see a VERY long sequence concerning Inspector Pazzi's hunt for the infamous &quot;Il Mostre&quot;. These scenes really fleshed out the characters. The 5 behind the scenes featurettes are informative, even if there is virtually NOTHING about the Verger makeup. I really enjoyed the the poster gallery, as well. The film itself looks great, and the commentary by Director Ridley Scott is a keeper. I especially liked his overview of the 3rd ending they were considering. Couldn't they have filmed the Book's ending though?",N/A
532450,"If your like me, you liked &quot;The Sixth Sense&quot;, but hated Haley Joel Osment.  A lot of people aren't a fan of the kid, and I'm one of them.  Although I do give him credit, because he can act extremely well... he just annoys me.  So, going into &quot;Unbreakable&quot;, I had a few mixed emotions.  I didn't even know what the plot was, just knew that it was another thriller from Shyamalan, who, under the right circumstances, is a genius.  In my estimation, this just so happens to be one of those circumstances.  In the opening minutes, the camerawork involved got me worked up, and anticipating what was to come.Of course, if you've seen the trailors for the film, you know the basic outline: Bruce Willis becomes the Sole Survivor of a train wreck, and oddly enough, he comes out of it with not even a scratch.  He gets a mysterious letter, which makes him think about how many times he's been sick.  He can't remember a time when he was ill, and eventually meets Elijah, whose convinced that Willis contains superpowers, and just might be a superhero?  A lot of mind-boggling things happen after this, and the story only develops for the better.The thing that made me love this so damn much was the entire movie was like the first act of a regular superhero movie.  Usually the hero accepts his powers, and goes on to save the world, but Bruce Willis just doesn't want this power/burden.  The ending is one of the best I've seen in a while, and Willis and Shyamalan are thinking about making a trilogy.  A trilogy would definitely be good, but leaving it where it is now would be even better.  The film is almost flawless.The DVD isn't a slouch either.  The only other thing I wanted on this was an audio commentary, with Shyamalan, Willis, and Jackson.  That would make it a perfect package.  The transfer is beautiful(the colors are brought out magnificently), and the audio is just as lovable.  I loved the score to the film.  On the second disc are a few fun, informative featurettes that could have been a little bit longer.  There's also a multi-angle, multi-audio &quot;deconstruction&quot; of a scene that will probably only suit movie-buffs and film students.  Next up, there's a slew of deleted scenes which were really good, instead of the usual trash found with most deleted scenes.  They could have been very important in the telling of the film, but would have really slowed down the pacing.  Lastly, there's a hilarious bit in which M. Night Shyamalan includes another one of his extremely funny &quot;kid films&quot;.  This one's entitled &quot;Night's First Fight&quot;.  The sound effects and acting pretty much sum up what I'm talking about.The film is stellar, as is the DVD.  If your a fan of thrillers, this is definitely up your alley, and go into it more open-minded than usual.  You'll enjoy it much more that way.",Unbreakable

483898,"This is perhaps Disney's best film yet, even managing to top the original, which is certainly a rare feat.  Basically it's a children's film for adults, who'll love the many movie references ('Jurassic Park' and 'The Empire Strikes Back' to name but two) and the jokes that go over the kids' heads.  Thankfully though, the film also delivers to the kids though too, with plenty of visual jokes as well.There's not one annoying character, each one drawn sympathetically and realistically to help the audience completely forget that they're only watching an animated film.  The new characters are great too - especially Jessie (Joan Allen), Stinky Pete (Kelsey Grammer) and Mrs Potato Head.  More importantly though, 'Toy Story 2' grips its audience with some stunning action pieces (with the camera moving as if Woody and co. were real) and real poignancy.  I can think of countless children's films that have been spoiled by an overly schmaltzy ending, but this is genuinely heart-warming, with the story of children outgrowing their toys being startlingly close to children outgrowing their parents.  Wisely picking Sarah McLachlan to sing the theme 'When She Loved Me', with her achingly sad vocals, works well.Quite frankly, this is a movie that crosses all boundaries as well as all expectations.  One to be watched.",N/A
77679,"Stir of EchoesScore: 41/100People had been talking about Stir of Echoes around New Zealand, saying it was 10 times scarier than The Sixth Sense and it was very well commercialised. But, Stir of Echoes borrows so heavily from The Sixth Sense that it might as well have been titled The Seventh Sense, and it is a huge disappointment.Tom (Kevin Bacon) is a regular guy, a utilities lineman, married, with a young son, his wife is pregnant; he hangs out with long-time pals in a Chicago neighborhood. At a party, his sister-in-law hypnotizes him, and he goes into a deep trance. Before waking him, she suggests that he keep his mind open. That night he sees flashes of violence and the ghost of a young woman. His young son, too, is &quot;a receiver,&quot; but while the boy is calm and coherent in his conversations with spirits, Tom is confused and agitated. Over time, the young woman's story comes to the surface, and Tom begins a hunt for her body that puts him and his usually understanding wife, Maggie (Katherine Erbe), in grave danger.Stir of Echoes does not only take scenes from The Sixth Sense, it uses The Shining's story, man-goes-crazy-and-freaks-family-out, and it basically insults the brilliance of Stanley Kubrick's masterpiece. Most of the performances are laughable, especially Kevin Bacon and Zachary David Cope in a stupidly over-blown chemistry, but, Katherine Erbe manages to an okay heroine, though she does not put nearly enough effort in to save this film. The easy way to say it is this film is predictable, annoying and boring, and does not deserve the critical-acclaim and large audience it got.The finale is entertaining and neatly done, but, guess what! It uses exactly the same techniques as The Green Mile did! God, it's becoming uncountable how many movies this borrows from. Stir of Echoes is a passable and mostly lame horror film that always tries to score, and never earns many points.",Stir Of Echoes
578228,"This disc has two great episodes of the original series:In &quot;Obsession&quot; Kirk pursues a mysterious, if clearly deadly life-form - a cloudlike being that sucks the life out of men.  As Ahab encountered &quot;Moby Dick&quot;, Kirk has had a fatefeul run-in with the cloud-beast, years earlier.  Men died and Kirk was too slow to pull out his phaser and despatch the beast.  Unsure whether the mysterious beast would have even succumbed to phaser fire, Kirk is left only with his doubts, guilts and an obsession - something he had practically forgotten....until the good captain re-econcounters the evil cloud.&quot;Obsession&quot; excels because the guilt and fear are convincingly etched on Kirk's face, but also for another reason hard to forget: the beast has its own scent, something like honey, and its effect on Kirk surpasses the cheesy effects of the show.&quot;Immunity Syndrome&quot; is also an excellent epsiode - the Enterprise seeks the story behind the mysterious dissappearqance of a Vulcan starship, and discovers a huge space-born amoeba.  The life form surrounds itself with a dark zone that nothing can escape from.  Rather than make the nature of the creature and the ship's predicament (once the Enterprise enters the zone, it's trapped) immeidately obvious, the story builds gradually.  Once inside, the beast sucks the ship and its crew of their energy - rapidly diminishing the crew's ability to deal with the problem.  I remember this episode especially for the desperation clearly etched on the crew - when Kirk decides that somebody has to fly a shuttlecraft into the mysterious creature, You just knew that it was a one-way trip.  The episode culminates in excellent exchange with Spock - calling out from his dying shuttle - for the Enterprise to leave him behind and save itself.  &quot;Dammit, Spock&quot; McCoy shouts over the speaker &quot;We're trying to save you!&quot;  Spock responds, registering perhaps the most surprise he's ever displayed - &quot;why thank you....Captain McCoy.&quot;  A True TOS moment and one more reason to get this video.",N/A

889727,"Paddy Chayefsky wrote 3 great movies in a row in the 60's and 70's, each dealing with great institutions and centering around the crack-up of men within those institutions. All are bitingly funny, wise, and loaded with a knowing cynicism, the satire just barely exaggerating the themes explored. They are, of course, The Americanization of Emily, Hospital, and Network.In Hospital the target was the bureaucratization of Medical Care and Science (pre HMO era); in Network it was Corporate Media and the merger of Power with Journalism and Popular Entertainment (pre AOL/Time Warner etc.), and in The Americanization of Emily, the first, it is the Military and the marketing of Warfare and Valor.In each film, men struggle with their sanity amidst institutions that have gone mad. But, to render these films into a few lines of description is not to do them justice. They are complex films, with many ideas and subplots all wrapped up in Chayefski's beautiful, intelligent, and unique language.They are also hilarious, and complimented by brilliant casting. In The Americaniztion of Emily, James Garner is the perfect choice to play the conniving and slick &quot;dogrobber&quot; Charlie Madison, a confirmed &quot;coward&quot; since tasting combat and finding life as an Admiral's facilitating aide much more to his liking. It is arguably Garner's best performance.The rest of the cast is fine, with Julie Andrews demonstrating how her goody-two-shoes image (from Mary Poppins etc) probably kept her from better roles, such as this passionate and sexy woman. James Coburn and Melvin Douglas are both standouts as well.An Admiral having a breakdown wants the first fatality on Omaha Beach to be a sailor so that he can parlay that into bigger appropriations for the Navy from the Congress. Using this, Chayefsky (working from William Bradford Huie's novel), fashions a terrific discussion of the nature of valor, heroism, modern warfare and love &amp; one's true responsibility.Chayefsky basically understands that modern warfare is a meat-grinder, killing thousands at a go, and individual acts of heroism, while noble, are lost in so vast a slaughter. They are the myths of another era and perpetuate the idea of war as somehow noble and worthwhile. He centers his blame not on the Military and Politicians who blunder us into wars, but on the mass of people who go along with and surrender to the myth of sacrifice and heroism. How does one individual cope with this massive power bent on destroying him?You may find the ending with Charlie going along with the myth problematic, but it is a final acknowledgement that one individual can only affirm and cherish his own life and that his world begins with &quot;you {Emily}, a room, a house, a neighborhood, a city, a country and a universe...in that order&quot;.The themes may be serious, but the movie is a load of fun.

667571,"I saw this film some 8 years ago in a revival theatre along with most of Godard's early classics. As a part of his body of work, Les Carabiniers fits in snugly, but I would most emphatically recommend NOT to start your Godard spree with it. The film appears messy, with inconsistent pacing, strange comic interludes, baffling dialogue and pointed (but rarely obvious) commentary about the nature of war. Godard utilizes some action scenes (taking cues from Sam Fuller) and plays with the conventions of Hollywood cinema with obvious delight. Much of this is true of all his films up to WEEKEND. But at the heart of this small film there is an anger that would only resurface years later - probably due to the fact that this film was pulled from the market soon after its release (thanks to public indifference and critical vehemence, both of which are understandable reactions if you expect your standard fare from a film such as this). It is invigoratingly different, energetic to a fault, and of course pure Godard. It doesn't have (m)any familiar faces in it, and the sloppy approach with eccentric acting only enhances the narrow line between innocence and cruelty that the film repeatedly touches on.

333221,"This is a huge Chaplin collection featuring thirty-two of his short films from the 1910s and 1920s.  Be warned that while some of the films have obviously been well preserved, some others have not been as carefully looked after.  There are definitely some signs of aging in this collection, but that is only to be expected.  The poorer quality shorts seem to be randomly distributed throughout the videos, presumably based solely on who was in charge of taking care of each individual film.  A few of the films are of quite poor quality, however, there is nothing that is actually unwatchable.  This does not mean that the collection should be ignored by the silent movie fan.  There is quite a lot of excellent material included in this collection that will leave you literally falling off of your chair in laughter.Chaplin did a lot of things very well in his films and with thirty-two shorts to view here, you gets to see quite a bit of his filmmaking range.  Some are hilarious, others are touching and sentimental, and a few others are early-film experiments that just do not quite work.  Chaplin obviously enjoyed the sentimental themes that run though his film, however, more than any other filmmaker, he consistently got them right.  The sentiment is not gratuitous and is rarely over the top.  And the beauty of the short format is that if you don't care for the one you are currently viewing, you will not have long to wait until the next one starts (just like Sex Pistols songs).My personal favourites from this are as follows:THE ADVENTURER -- the story of Charlie as he escapes from jail and wrecks havoc on some upper-class people at a hotel.  The chase sequences in this are priceless as Charlie jumps off of balconies and dives over banisters with the grace of a ballerina.THE IMMIGRANT -- Charlie comes to America.  This is an excellent story that manages to be both hilarious and thoughtfully sentimental at the same time.  The downtrodden tramp adds a waiter and an immigration officer to the long list of people he has kicked in the backside.ONE A.M. -- a drunken Charlie comes home late from a party and does battle with his house.This collection is highly recommended viewing for any silent movie fan.",Chaplin Collection VHS

The action is brilliant; you get everything from gruesome killings to leaping tigers in some visual effects that look truly real, you won't even notice they are computer-generated or CGI. The drama is the heart of the movie however, the back-story is the story of a man, his love for his family, his strong abilities and his will to escape. This man is played to perfection by Russell Crowe in one of his most gritty roles to date. There is also a fantastic supporting cast - Oliver Reed, Joaquin Phoenix, Connie Neilsen and Amistad's Djimon Hounsou - all give life to interesting roles. Okay, so there are lots of flaws in the editing, Joaquin's scar changing from right to left and an aeroplane crossing the arena, but, this is a movie you watch for enjoyment, not to diss the mistakes that come up, even though they do.

663337,"As a newbie in Moby matters (started seriously paying attention to his work, like lots of people, since the release of ""Play"") When I first heard of the upcoming release of this DVD, I could hardly contain my excitement.The DVD is made up of a combination of previously seen material with some new things worth seeing:-Play the videos: for the most part it's a compilation of videos from songs of the 'Play' album. Yes; incredibly missed here is a video for the song that Moby came to re-record alongside beautiful Gwen Stefani, ""South Side.""-Moby's Megamix: Moby's Megamix: 90 minutes of remixes of Play's very best, which are synched to some very nice visuals ranging from kaleidoskopic views, to the most hypnotic takes you can imagine. It equally makes an excellent audiovisual background to the intro or the highest point any party you may throw at your place.-Give an Idiot a Camcorder: features shots of Moby by himself while on tour, doing accents (Scottish, English with a French accent), including a not-so-glorious spot of him in a toilet, among other things.-Live on TV Jools Holland: some (6) live TV appearances, where he plays some of his material as well as a long time Joy Division favorite of his.-Play the computer: you can remix your own version of Moby's music.Overall, a must for any serious Moby fan.",Moby: Play - The
108200,"Hey guys,If you know anything about this film, you'll know well enough to stay away.  Yes, this film is below garbage, but again, I never thought I'd witness another film by (former stunt-driver/director) Hal Needham,  Mr. Needham has a fresh approach this time, a bold approach - place the characters in the center of the frame, get acceptable lighting, place them in focus.  Nothing to it.  Well, there IS something to it.  And it's called a Real Movie'. This film is flat out garbage.  It's almost an Anti-Movie, those Hollywood pirates involved went out of their way to make a film that is flat, simple and just darn stupid.  Which is why I bought a copy.  Nobody - but NOBODY - makes films like this anymore.  Our current studio system may hire once-talented acting folk like Ben Affleck, Leo DiCaprio, Wynona Ryder, etc., the lot, whatever.  But never have we seen such a concentrated potion of ex-stars like 'Cannonball Run 2'.  But we get our shot - Burt Reynolds, Sammy Davis, Dean Martin, Abe Vigoda, Telly Savalis, Marilu Henner, Jim 'Gomer Pyle' Nabors, Don Knotts, Charles Nelson Reilly, that big klutz who played 'Jaws' in 2 James Bond films, even Jackie Chan, who later found some worthwhile projects to latch onto.  There are many other has-been appearences, but they merge in the film.  A film which is flat-out garbage, but a film that is so bad I own.  Again, I own it, but one question remains:  just how much cocaine was on the set?  The reason I ask?  This is a movie without a purpose, a plot, a soul, a reason for being.  So, drugs HAVE to be the explanation....  Did I mention that this film has to be seen to be believed?  Well, you already know the answer.  And if you don't - enjoy the film.

410219,"I think this movie makes a good point about what matters when it comes to finding a boyfriend.  Julie, the main character, has a good-looking boyfriend, but feels the relationship is getting old.  Plus, Tommy (the name of her boyfriend) is a complete jerk. Julie meets this guy named Randy at a party and immediately takes a liking to him (and vice versa).  He's a Hollywood punker, he may not be a part of their group, but he's really a great guy--sensitive, caring, and above all, he loves Julie.  Julie is smart enough to see past his appearance and love him for the person he is, but her shallow friends can't see beyond that.  They want her to be with Tommy because he's &quot;so good-looking&quot;.  The pressure gets to Julie as she has to decide what she wants-- follow her heart or listen to her friends.

560737,"I know that Samuel L. Jackson made more movies in the last decade than anyone, and maybe that's why this movie is so ordinary. In his haste to get into every movie being made, Jackson must have forgot to actually look at the script for this film. As always Jackson gives a terrific, larger than life performance, but he had so little to work with that the movie seemed beneath him. The Shaft franchise has so many possibilities, but it soon turns into a confusing mix of shallow characters and sub plots.It all starts with the assault (turned murder) of young African-American man outside an upscale nightclub. We know within five minutes of the opening credits who committed the crime (A rich spoiled white guy who's daddy would never let him go to jail.), so there is very little suspense or mystery there after. Soon you see Jackson in a courtroom consoling a woman you must assume is the murdered young mans mother. I say assume because they never actually tell you if she is or even what her name is. Fed up with the corruption surrounding this case and so many others Shaft quits the police force and vows to get justice his own way. From there the movie goes on to be confusing and way to hard to believe.I expected much more from a movie with Sam Jackson in it, but I can't fault him because he didn't write, direct or produce it. You have got to love the addition of Richard Roundtree to the cast but, Vanessa Williams as a tough city cop? I am huge Vanessa Williams fan but come on people, lets at least try to keep it real. Overall Shaft is a huge disappointment, but I give it three stars for the presence Samuel L. Jackson brings to the screen and for including the real Shaft (Roundtree) in the film.",Shaft

On the other hand, it is so violent and graffic, it exposes you to that side of life that is far too real, unfortunately. Having known victims of violence, I can relate to them much better now than before, and I am glad that a movie can helped me on this point without having to go through it myself.The plot lacks a bit,, and the characters aren't delved into with much energy. However, there is enough there to help you through the horror scenes. So if you can deal with being depressed, and you just want to test yourself, this movie may not be a bad idea.",N/A
523217,"Seeing this for the first time today, it was greater than I could've ever imagined. For the first in a long time I felt overwhelmed, dazzled and completely in identification with the movie.I truly admire the film, the writer, the director, and the crew -  They've done a superb work. Reviving a distant history tale to life is an admirable achievement I will always salute to.The thing that seized me most of all is the model Mister Russell Crowe portrayed. This is certainly not a surprise, for he was meant to do just that, being the good hero, nevertheless, the core of his being still stands out, maybe more for people like myself than for others.I'm trying to express here that the Gladiator is unique for representing the survival of the is right and honorary in a world that is crumbling apart, and that is running out of all the things people consider as good, true and justified. Despite the horrible world surrounding him, Maximus (Crowe) manages to survive - But not by completely becoming a ruthless beast. He does develop and uses dreadful skills of an animal - but only to survive. Whenever he can the man of honor in him evokes to show that he isn't completely corrupted, and forward, to show that this good side is his true self.For that I'm humbled. I want to always remember this in spite of the world where living in, which tends to drag a man down a slippery road of corruption and acts that lack all honor. Our culture is degrading in a one-way direction toward decadence, and I think that anyone who objects this mainstream should stay true to what he believes in no matter what the rest do or think. It's a hard task, very hard; there are so many temptations out there, and obstacles to pass through. In here, Maximus give us an example of endurance - and for that he deserves all the credit we can give him - in return.Maybe a moral of the story could be that if you fight hard you will eventually win . I'd like to believe it is true. Russell Crowe has created in me one more sincere hope it is achievable, and it's a great sucess for itself.In the end, he did win the Oscar price, he earned respectively. In all the other aspects this film is magnificent . I'm glad the film has won all those Oscars, evidently, the best film of last year ,and of course - not one to be missed.",Gladiator VHS

Basically, you need to set it so that the blue portion of the 3D image matches the blue lens of your 3D glasses.As for the story, well, it was kinda weak, and very similar to the (as stated above) Twilight Zone episode where the couple wakes up, hungover, after a party in a strange town that seems to have no escape. Here, however, the characters get to the outskirts of town to find a clear wall/dome surrounding the city.

36869,"TRICK is a bolt out of the blue -- a delicious farce-comedy that deals pleasantly and very romantically with two young men who meet with lust on their minds and whose relationship develops into warmth and charm in the course of a muddled and harried night.  The &quot;trick&quot; here is the truly superb work of John Paul Pitoc and Christian Campbell, and the zany off-beat casting for Tori Spelling as Campbell's ditsy, no-talent, off-off Broadway actress-singer friend.  Pitoc has the kind of charisma that should propel him into important roles.  He has the unique ability of not saying a word and conveying the growth in the character.  His skills as a comic performer are evident as are his abilities at sensitivity.  The goofball comedy follows these two men as they try -- with no success at all - to find a place where they can be alone.  Yes, some of the moments, involving Campbell's odd assortments of friends that almost reach straining points.  But TRICK snaps back, and you are apt to leave it smiling -- no matter what your sexual preference.  It is a surprising delight from literally out of nowhere.",N/A

It is a compelling story told by a strong cast, backed by breathtaking cinematography and a haunting musical score. It is an unparalled blend of action, morality and romance. The movie presents without preaching what every man should want to be, heroic without conceit, loyal to self and family without compromise, cognisant of duty without ambition.This would easily make my list of 10-best movies.

540191,"This movie quite clearly demonstrates the two diametrically opposing views of two very different moviemakers.First Comment: This movie didn't just push the limit for a PG-13.  It broke well through that veil into the realm of &quot;R.&quot;Consider: Stanley Kubrick... Full Metal Jacket (grusome murder/suicide), A Clockwork Orange (raping and beating a woman to death with a huge ceramic penis), etc etc.  Kubrick cannot MAKE a PG-13 film, and this one is NO EXCEPTION.  This movie is NOT suitable for children - no matter how sappy a happy ending was tacked onto it.  This movie was mis-rated.  It should have been rated R for violence, gore, and strong sexual inuendo. Do kids really need to see a gigilo seducing a yound, crying, abused wife into having sex with a machine?  Do kids really need to see a city with a building in the shape of a woman's spread legs, up in the air, with neon-light fishnet stockings, and people entering and leaving through, well, you know...?  Does that sound like a PG-13?  How about &quot;virtual&quot; lap-dances?I'm not suggesting that the world may not one day bee like that, or that it's not like that already in some places.  But that doesn't mean your kids need to see it.Do not take your children to see this movie unless they are comfortable seeing &quot;people&quot; cut in half with chainsaws, shot out of cannons (on fire) into spinning chopper blades where they are sliced to bits and their heads go flying, people getting their faces burned off with acid, people tied to &quot;crosses&quot; and then pulled limb from limb, and listening to gigelos describe what they are going to &quot;do&quot; to some women when they get their hands on them.The robots are left JUST enough &quot;robitica&quot; to make it clear that they are not human, but that doesn't change the fact that someone with a kind, motherly face who has taken a small frightened boy under her care get's pulled away violently, tied to a post and has that face burned off with buckets of nitric acid.A second notion that is being passed around is that the movie &quot;really makes you think&quot; and &quot;raises some good questions about mortality and love.&quot;  Perhaps.  But these questions have all been asked by far greater philosophers and writers in far less of a vulgar way.  You will not find yourself asking any questions that Shakespeare or Nietche or Kant (or Spielberg for that matter) have not already asked of you time and again.The movie starts out as a slow, steady progression of childhood discovery and love, then takes a violent &quot;Mad-Max in the Thunderdome&quot; lurch to the side into a domain that could have been left out of the movie entirely with no impact at all on the main characters lives, or the story, or it's impact.  When it comes back from it's detour (presumably where Spielberg takes over), what's left is more &quot;slow steady progression&quot; towards a bland, not entirely unexpected finish.  The ending was, however, rather unique and every bit as sad as the little boy who by now, you already know, is lost.But the movie does move along, and the visual scenery is quite fascinating (except for the detour-to-gore).  Some points really are made very well.  Like for instance the &quot;robot hunters&quot; who travel around in a huge balloon that looks like a HUGE moon.  The result is a terror implanted in the mind of a boy: a terror of the moon.  Something usually taken as a symbol of beauty becomes a symbol of fear and terror to a small boy.  What kind of people would DO that to a young boy?  But that's the real world.  A normally happy childhood is, for some, a terror.  Who would do that?  Look around you - you probably know some of them.Worth seeing as an adult - kids should go see something else.  Jude Law does a VERY good &quot;Artful Dodger.&quot;",N/A
526095,"Scream was so famous because of it's use of comedy and horror. This movie has decided to mix drama with horror and it doesn't work....at all. Its soooooooo drug out and boring that when something truly scary happens, it scares the crap out of you! The drama in The Sixth Sense was so enjoyable because of the great script and the terrific cast. The cast in this is nothing short of terrific too, but its the script that makes the movie so slow. The characters aren't interesting at all. They are extremely ordinary and and just lifeless. They are only likable because you know going into the film that they are your main characters and you have to like them. They do nothing or say nothing to make you like them. Michelle Pfeiffer's character is scared through out the whole movie - even at the beginning - for no reason. First the neighbor scares her, then the ghost scares her, then she's scaring herself! It seems like she walks around this movie trying to be scared. She seems to have no hobby or no life. The reason I gave this movie four stars is because it is well acted, there is a great mystery (even though it passes by sooooo slowly) and the ending is nothing but a shocking twist that leaves your mouth hanging open for about a half an hour (being the horror movie lover that I am, I did guess what was going on before it was revealed). There are some really good scares, probably because it is slow then the scares come fast, but at least it does it's job. And the setting is quite eerie. What Lies Beneath is good and is definitely worth watching....just know that its slow and does drag for sometime.",What Lies Beneath VHS

I just bought the book and know that even though it will not be exactly like the movie (when are they ever?), the book will most likely prove to be even better.

(You know, the Rapture, the Antichrist, and other weird stuff that's been written about for the last 35-40 years.) Hal  Lindsey tried to do the same thing, in his best-selling, but far-fetched book, upon which this film is based. Supposedly, both ventures make the claim that that it's all based upon the Bible. I guess that statement is supposed to make it all true, and cause us to quake in our boots.Unfortunately, the film doesn't make its case. Not even close. Like the book, it simply piles claim upon amazing claim. In the process, it quotes, what look like, authoritative Bible passages, as &quot;proof&quot;. But all of those verses are either ambiguous, taken out of context, or irrelevant to the issue being soken about. To say they pertain to the 20th, or 21st, century, is seriously distorting the plain meaning of the sentences. It's reading too much into those passages, for the sake of getting people to make impulsive faith decisions out of fear. And, quite frankly, to make some big bucks. The bottom line is that the existence of unicorns has more &quot;proof&quot; than any of these supernatural claims.The sad part about it is that otherwise intelligent people have fallen for this claptrap, and invested a good part of their lives in these beliefs. For many believers, as long as an authority figure guides them along, they'll believe anything. When did Orson Welles become a Bible scholar? Mr. Welles might have been one of the greatest film directors and actors of all time -- and I'm a BIG fan of his cinematic efforts -- but he was also a great showman and magician. (He would take on any project for the cash.) The problem is that there are too many gullible people who will fall for these wacko theories.When I say that the book and the film are both absurd examples of hucksterism, it's after I've read the book, and viewed the film. Then I asked myself the question: &quot;Is this REALLY what the Bible is saying?&quot; Do yourself a favor, and think, think, think, before you take that leap of faith. Stop, relax, check it out. Listen to what he's saying. And ask a lot of questions. Are all of these Bible passages describing events before the end of the world? Or are many of these verses describing things that already happened? Orson Welles, or Hal Lindsey, for that matter, won't tell you that these verses have been interpreted in five different ways, throughout the last 2,000 years. Check out a library book about the history of Bible theology. It's all documented.Shame on Orson! This was not one of your brighter moments.",N/A

You see a new vision of Earth after the melting of the Polar Ice caps, due to Global warming...what else. (see Waterworld for a butchered-dirty version of this idea).I enjoyed it. And I think Spielberg did too. But what happens when you get two great, but entirely different visions of the same project: an immediate shortcoming. Two visions means two beginnings, middles, and ends, and there lies the problem. Haley Joel Osment, doesn't blink the entire film. That alone shows his committment to character. A.I. has its own pace and rightly so, because there are many characters and ideas in the mix. I just don't know...I am debating as I type. What was missing?I guess just enjoy it. Allow yourself an open mind and realize that you will not leave the theater with a frozen smile on your face. A.I. is just what it is. A story about a creation that can love, and all it desires is love in return. He encounters several odd characters, some helpful, some deadly.

""To Live"" takes a different approach to narrate the confusing periods in Chinese history in the 20th century, to tell a store of life, and a history of a nation.  Don't get me wrong!  It's not a heavy movie like other portrayal movies of Chinese History such as ""Farewell My Concubine"", ""Blue Kite"" or ""the Last Emperor"" (they're good movies as well, but no comparison to ""To Live""); quite the contrary, ""To Live"" is humorous, delightful, positive, and encouraging. It's not only a good comedy that makes you laugh, but also makes you laugh with tears in your eyes, sad and sore in your heart.The main story line is how am ordinary family of Fu Gui (Ge You) and Jia Zhen (Gong Li) went through their lives in various movements, wars and revolutions in China.  A careless gambler, Fu Gui, lost everything he had - money, property and family - only left with a set of puppets. It's the same set of puppets that went through all the ups and downs with Fu Gui, his family and friends. Through all the tragic and comic moments and events, through all the bitter-sweetness and irony, the characters were in such a positive spirit that they could make jokes of anything in life, but only through the body languages and their eyes, you could see the heartache.There is an old Chinese proverb that states, ""the old man lost his horse, but it turned out to be his good luck"".  The entire movie is based on this theory: whether you gain or lose, promote or demote, you would never know if it were good for you at the end.  Life is a series of comedic dramas; if you don't face it with a positive attitude and joke back, even during the hardest struggle, you would not be able to survive.This movie is a masterpiece if you want to find out the meaning of Life, and how meaningful it is ""to live""!",N/A

The Coens have less and less originality and importance with every new trivial movie they release. Back when this was made they had no budget and amazing ideas, and that is the pleasure of watching this movie. Now they have big budgets and bland ideas. Were you concerned once in ""O brother"" that George Clooney might not get Holly Hunter back? If you were, are you under the age of nine? If ""O Brother"" was half an hour longer or shorter it would have no impact on the finished film. I've seen K-mart commercials with more tension than ""Fargo"" and ""O Brother."" For every challenging moment in ""Blood Simple"" there are engaging and satisfying results.So here it is finally... You've waited forever for this DVD and there are NO extra features and it's more expensive than movies packed with features. This DVD compounds the violations the Coens began with their re-edited re-scored and re-duced re-release of the movie. Anything resembling a pause has been edited out along with some amusing details. This is like taking Lars von Triers Zentropa (Another badly needed DVD that's missing in action) and releasing it in pan and scan and cutting thirty minutes out of it.

412676,"BIG DISCLAIMER: HALLOWEEN III HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH MICHAEL MYERS!!!! Okay, now with that out of the way, you may be able to enjoy this film for what it is without trying to compare it to other Halloween movies. It has a good storyline and is well-acted.While making &quot;Halloween III&quot;, the filmmakers had the idea of releasing a new Halloween film each year with a different storyline, and &quot;H3&quot; was the first, and sadly last film under that concept. It bombed at the box office and was widely trashed by fans, mainly because it veered off the Michael Myers path. The backlash forced producers to go back to the tired slasher motif for future &quot;Halloween&quot; films, none of which were worth the film they were printed on. &quot;Halloween III&quot; would've fared better if they simply titled it &quot;Season of the Witch&quot;. And for those who wonder where the witch was in the film, chief antagonist Conal Cochran is a Warlock (i.e. male witch).The film is very Cthulhu-esque in its mood. The plot is very creepy. Conal Cochran (portrayed nicely by Dan O'Herlihy) is a mask &amp; novelty magnate, who more or less controls a small town in California. He's also a Warlock, part of a long line of Irish Druids, and is not happy with the commercialization of Hallow's Eve. So what better way to keep his tradition alive than sacrificing millions of kids on Halloween night? He devises a master plan which includes to use of his masks, computer chips laced with stonehenge dust, a catchy TV commercial, and android goons who do the necessary dirty work, killing those who know too much.Dan Challis (Tom Atkins) &amp; Ellie (Stacy Nelkin) become caught up in the scheme and are determined to find out what is behind the murder of Ellie's father, who owned a novelty store and bought masks from Cochran. The story unfolds as they do their detective work, climaxes at the Silver Shamrock factory, and ends all too ironically. It's not a gore-fest, but more of a thinking-man horror film. The plot slowly dawns on our heroes &amp; viewers as we go.I have two  complaints. The storyline moves very slowly. It's a good plot, but could have been better if the plot unfolded quicker. My second complaint is the inclusion of the androids. The story would've been much creepier if they were simply human cronies or zombies. Overall, it's a decent horror film and a nice break from the slasher genre. Give it a shot if you need a break from the gore-in-your-face horror film.",Halloween 3 - Season of the Witch VHS

And this was the same issue with his earlier two movies but back then he managed to pull the movie together with an amazing shocking ending. But here with Fight Club, I was hoping that the ending would make this movie makes sense but instead it was an insult to the viewers!Second, the twist of Tyler Durden (Brad Pitt) in the last quarter of the movie... can't be swallowed easily because all through the movie (if you watch it back) nothing indicates that this can be valid!Third, the bodies of those club fighters were all skinny with little body modification. I haven't seen one person with real big body!!!Fourth, what is it to enjoy in this film? It is not entertaining, not logical, no suspense... etc.This movie can not be accepted with all audiences, it is either love it or H A T E it nothing in between! And I hate it!!!",N/A
478203,"When I first sat down to watch &quot;Cowboy Bebop&quot; I really didn't know what to expect. Many of the reviews here at Amazon.com say that this is one of the greatest anime series out there today. I found this very hard to believe considering some of the other choices out there: Trigun, Tenchi Muyo, Slayers, Dragonball. Those are some very good series in and of themselves and I found it hard to fathom that another series could be considered, hands down, to be the best out there.After watching the first two episodes on the DVD, I found that I really didn't understand the story very well and the characters were a little foggy. Thankfully, this was quickly cleared up as I continued watching. The characters are slowly, but smoothly developed and I didn't find myself having to ask very many questions on why someone was doing something. By the end of the DVD, I felt as if I'd grown up with Spike and Jet and I began to look for their tell-tale quirks. Overall, the story and characters are pretty average (so far) for an anime series and they don't break any new ground. At the same time, however, they make it entertaining to watch.The soundtrack and imagery is definitely not average. It is far, far above average. This series contains, quite possibly, the greatest soundtrack I've ever heard... Outweighing even some Hollywood films! Meanwhile, the imagery used in some of the scenes is outstanding. This includes a breathtaking cathedral scene in episode 5 and an awesome hyperspace chase scene in episode 4. When both of these aspects are paired, you'll be floored by it.In conclusion, I can't really label any anime series as my &quot;favorite&quot;. Trigun is great to watch when I'm in the mood for goofy humor or excellent character development. Dragonball is great for watching exciting action. But, when I'm in the mood for intense imagery and a great concept, Cowboy Bebop is definitely the way to go.",Cowboy Bebop - Session 1

82395,"My 2 year old daughter absolutely loves this film. And as her loving father, I have watched SNOW WHITE with her now countless times. Back when I was single, I found SNOW WHITE AND THE SEVEN DWARFS (dwarves?), to be boring and weak on story. But now seeing it through my daughter's eyes, seeing her pure glee as Snow White befriends and sings and dances with the little people... it's all extremely charming and heart warming.But here's what I don't understand. The Evil Queen is the ""fairest one of them all"" for quite a while, until Snow White suddenly wakes up one morning (puberty completes?) and is declared by the Magic Mirror to be the fairest one in the land. So now the Evil Queen is the SECOND fairest one of all. Not such a bad thing to be, really, particularly given her age. But she gets so enraged by being bumped down to the second slot that death to her own step-daughter appears to be the only reasonable answer.After the Huntsman warns Snow White and lets her escape (as opposed to taking advantage of the ""fairest one"" and then killing her with the Queen's permission), the Queen decides she's going to take care of her herself. And how does she do it? The Queen opens her huge spellbook and CHANGES HER APPEARANCE into that of an old beggar woman. Why not just change your appearance back again to become the fairest of them all?!? Why does regaining the title of the fairest cause her to instead change into a wretchedly ugly beast? That seems like poor planning.Or why not just let Snow White run off with that Prince at the very start (she watches them from the window)? Then Snow White would be out of the Queen's hair and she'd again be fairest.Cartoons are so hard!",N/A
351539,"The only reason I am rating this a 4 is because the supporting characters that would do just about anything to beat Ranma, or make him look bad, or just enjoy the simple sight of watching him lose a fight, end up acting like his cheerleaders towards the end of the movie, and I am sorry but Mousse, Ryouga and a few others would *NOT* cheer for Ranma in a fight.Anyway, the story has almost every main character ever introduced to the series in it, and quite a few that are new or seldom seen, and the additional bonus of a new character named Jasmine who hails from China and has a large grudge against Happosai, and a large elephant to back her up.The story then moves to China as Ranma and the gang chase her abductors (yes *sigh* - Akane gets kidnapped again, by another idiot that wants to marry her).  These abductors happen to be VERY powerful, and very elusive martial artists from China, and the battle for Akane gets hot and heavy towards the end.Overall I liked this Ranma 1/2 movie, even though it was a tad predictable.  But part of what makes Ranma 1/2 a winning formula is using the bits that work.  So you can't blame Takahasi and Viz for making the first Ranma 1/2 movie released in theaters a bit fomulaic.  The second movie is much better, if also a little cookie cutter.","Ranma 1/2 - The Movie 1, Big Trouble in Nekonron China VHS"

540408,"AI is the kind of movie that leaves you desparately wanting it to be better. Perhaps if you think about it hard enough, it ispossible to convince yourself that its as good as you wanted it to be. I suspect this is what American critics were doing when hailing the film as a masterpiece, a fantastic Spielbergian fusion - the imagination and magic of ET with maturity of Schindler, with a touch of Kubrickian objectivity thrown in for good measure. Unfortunately, if one is looking for AIs precedents in the Spielberg canon one need look no further back than Hook, or going right back, his 1978 flop1941.  These are very different movies from AI it is true, but they are also examples of an unrestrained and out of control Spielberg, whose presence is felt very early on in AI, and who proceeds to gradually to rip the premise beyonds the bounds of credulity.  It would be wrong to label this Speilberg's worst film, but it certainly his most desperately uneven.The plot, ostenibly a curious whismy to have come from Kubrick (although mans co-existence with technology is a strand running throughout his output), is set in a not too distant future, in a world where humanoid robots are commonplace. Here, a robot scientist sets out to make a  hummanoid boy who is capable of both giving and recieving love.  Here, the boy, David (Haley Joel Osment) is adopted by a couple whose own son is in a coma, essentially to fulfil their emotional needs.  Its a fascinating concept, but right from the start, the emotional dynamics of it are ambiguous.  Are we suppossed to feel happy when Monica, the mother figure, begins to &quot;love&quot; David because the implication is that parental &quot;love&quot; is little more than a superficial need which can be filled by any bowl-haired cutie with cow-like eyes and a need for cuddles.In a strange way, there is misogynistic vain running throughout AI.  Ostenibly, the most important aspect in the films is its examination of the mother/child bond.  But what does AI say about that bond?  Monica falls in love with David, not a selfless, maternal love but a love based on how David is programmed to make her feel about herself - needed and loved. Then when her own son returns,  she dumps David in  the woodlands, having outlasted his usefulness. This is a cynical and deeply unfeeling portrait of the maternal bond and one senses it has far more Kubrick than Speiberg in it.However emotionally barbed they maybe, these are actually the best scenes in the film. They are Kubrickian in vein - shot in cool, stone-washed colours and alarming us with the emotionalseductiveness of David, a creation Speilberg never lets us forget is artificial, and therefore perhaps making us question our own precept of what love is.  It is unsettling and provocative, not at all pleasant,  but it has its own voice and logic.  The next two acts of the film, which concern Davids misguided quest to find his mother after she dumps him in the woods, dispense completely with both of these.The main problem with the remainder of the film is that there is virtually no interaction between humans and robots.  Therefore the principle strand of tension and interest in abandoned,  and Spielberg chooses to underline the artificiality of the premise by having virtually all the interaction take place between David and Gigolo Joe(Jude Law), a sort of robotic prostitute.  Because it is a relationship between robot and robot, there is no gravity here, and the film becomes increasingly emotionally and stylistically unhinged, with every weird odessey seeming stranger and more out of place than the next.  It feels, and there is no better word, artificial. The ending, a cloying and manipulative retreat in to Spielbergian sentimentalism, underlines the innocence of the child's love, but also the naivety of the director himself.  Spielberg has always dealt in moral and emotional certainies - and even in his most mature works, those polarities are crystal clear.  AI is ambiguous, even paradoxical in terms of its moral and emotional tenure and rather than acknowldege this with a thoughtful, somewhat inconclusive ending, Spielberg simply reverses the tone of the entire film for its third act which is almost jaw-droppingly miscalculated.Kubick passed Spielberg the mantle on AI becuase he thought it to be closer to the young director's sensibilities.  The problem with AI as it turned out is that there is no prevailing sensibility, just an ultimately incoherent hash -a director trying to tell a story whose ambiguities he does not acknowledge and whose need for restraint he does not recognise.  Whatever else AI maybe, on its own terms it is ulimately a faliure.",N/A

He's surrounded by people that make him go even more mental, plus the fact that he can't save as many people as he used to.  The movie has some humor and drama; I guess it's worth your time.  Then again, there are a few poor qualities that leave the movie down.

571755,"...I thought this was going to be cute cookie-cutter chick comedy, but it ended up being quite dark and original.  Some reviewers have complained about the violence in the film, but these elements are justified and logical....the people involved in the violence generally get what they deserve (which kinda bugs me about lighthearted films where someone dies....the person that dies always is set up as a complete jerk, just to make the audience feel better...Boo!).Anyway, definitely a quirky, vivid film worth the acclaim it has received. All actors involved do a fine job (especially Morgan).  Don't, however, expect a hilarious performance out of Chris Rock--his character is somewhat unpleasant and cynical.  However, he pulls it off well...just don't expect the humor he is known for.The extras are pretty good, too...the soap opera episodes are included (9 of them, about 5 minutes each), as well as commentary tracks by the director and cast, and a second track with the director and film crew.  The movie trailers and TV spots looked totally unfamiliar to me--I don't really remember this film being in theaters!",N/A
452859,"The twentieth-year anniversary of John Carpenter's seminal slasher opus, ""Halloween,"" finds original star Jamie Lee Curtis once again facing off against her arch-nemesis: Michael Myers. Set exactly twenty years following the events of ""Halloween II,"" ""Halloween H20"" ignores the three installments preceding it. That means no Jamie Lloyd, no wacky cult subplot and no mysterious man in black.In this reboot of sorts, Laurie Strode has faked her own death, fleeing to California where she works as a private school teacher. Wrestling with her demons, she struggles with blatant alcoholism while trying to raise her resentful teenage son, John (Josh Hartnett). Things eventually come to a head when Michael plans a family reunion of sorts and follows her cross-country, engaging her in one last (?) game of cat and mouse.While ""Halloween H20"" tries its hardest to restore order to a franchise that had gotten more and more convoluted with each subsequent installment, it can't help but succumb to some problems of its own. Capitalizing on the teen-slasher boom of the late 90's, the seventh film in the long-standing franchise opts to pay tribute to Wes Craven's ""Scream"" in more ways than one. From its cheeky self-referential script penned by ""Scream"" writer Kevin Williamson, to its recycled score by Marco Beltrami and its casting of hip and hot WB stars, this film reeks of late 90's teen slasher. While ""Scream"" itself paid homage to the original ""Halloween"" in clever ways, the reverse treatment given by ""H20"" is not only premature but serves to date the film horribly as well.It's not all bad news for the film, though. Jamie Lee Curtis is in top form here, portraying the on-the-edge version of Laurie Strode as naturally and believably as she did the sweet and innocent girl next door decades before. Her final showdown against Myers can only be summed up as epic and is the saving grace of the entire film. This final act is jam-packed with suspense and emotion, and it's all thanks to Curtis's fiery performance. Supporting roles from LL Cool J and Adam Arkin are adequate, while a young Josh Hartnett cuts his teeth on a potentially juicy but ultimately one-dimensional character.Director Steve Miner made his bones in the 80's directing two ""Friday the 13th"" sequels as well as the semi-cult classic, ""House,"" so it should come as no surprise that he does an adequate job with his take on the Myers saga. While he's no John Carpenter, Miner does his best to bring the expected suspense and drama to the table, and even when it's obvious that the studio undercut him in more than a few ways (what's up with that CGI mask?) he still manages to provide significant class and closure to a floundering franchise.In the end, ""Halloween H20"" is hardly a perfect film. It's arguably better than the two films before it, but hardly lives up the original film or even its sequel. Fans will rejoice in seeing Jamie Lee Curtis back to the genre and hellbent on revenge, especially in the film's final moments. Unfortunately, the rest is just so painfully average and sanitized that it renders itself ineffective as a companion-piece to John Carpenter's masterpiece and plays more as a sign of the times. What could have truly been a grand cinematic event for horror nuts is instead yet another teen slasher flick, albeit one that's a slight notch above the rest.",Halloween H20 VHS
521431,"Bryan Singer was not my first choice to direct this film. I thought maybe Sam Raimi or Alex Proyas, someone who was a bit more VISUAL a director. Don't get me wrong here, Singer's debut film 'The Usual Suspects' still ranks as one of my favorite films of all time, but it so much different then adapting one of the most beloved and revered comic books of all time. But in the end Singer turned out to be the perfect choice. Why? His attention to characters. The X-Men, from it's earliest days, has always been a comic driven and defined by it's attention to character development, not just explosions and chaos. What Singer does here is miraculous. He takes a group of unbelievable characters and turns them into easily identifiable people, people who you might actually believe existed. The talented group of players lucky enough to play the roles in the film are uniformly fine. Patrick Stewart was born to play Professor Xavier, Famke Janssen is touching and alluring as Jean Grey, and Hugh Jackman (in a superb out-of-nowhere performance) brings humanity and lonliness to the imposing visage of Wolverine. The film also marks a bold departure from other films of it's kind in one more crucial area: special effects. Too many times the effects ARE the film, they are what holds our interest and define our excitement. While X-Men is by no means short on effects, the effects ENHANCE the characters instead of BEING the characters. These are people with gifts, we focus on them and not their abilities. The story is common-place comic book drivel, the good guys are out to stop the bad guys, blah blah blah... but it all hold together because of the intelligent and sometimes touching script. It's actually thought-provoking at times, a fact that makes me wonder why every other comic adaptation can not muster a single brain cell half the time. It is a fabulous achievement, a film that should not have succeeded but does because of a great script, wonderful performances, and assured direction from a man who is clearly out of his game. The DVD edition of X-Men is unique in one way as well: it's deleted scene can be viewed separately or pieced back into the film via a special 'branching' version of the film. It is clever and important. Many times I have watched the deleted scenes included in DVDs and been completely unable to get any impact from them whatsoever because they were being viewed out of context. This 'branching' feature marks a new standard and precedent that i hope many other DVDs will live up to. The picture quality is crisp and the sound is vibrant. No commentary track however (bummer) but it also house a few easter-eggs that a few people will stumble upon. A great package for a great film.",X-Men VHS
481143,"The comparison to Life is Beautiful is inevitable.  The only similarity that I can see is that both are a comedy that encompasses the biggest horror in humanity: the Holocaust.  Whereas La Vita e Bella is a one-man show, this is a story about a community that has to deal with the crisis in their own unique way.When the Germans are approaching the little Jewish village in France, the village votes to purchase a train, a German train rather, and a group of the villagers would pretend to be German soldiers accosting the condemned Jews to the concentration camp.  On their way to Russia and safety, one thing after another goes bad, there is the dissension in the rank by the &quot;Communist Jews&quot;, there are a French soldiers who really think that the train is a real German train and try to bomb it to save the Jews.  Then they meet up with real German soldiers and the adventure continues.  Whether they make it or not, you would have to watch it yourself, I won't ruin your ending.The comedy is rather heavy-handed, along with the amusing adventure, you learn about the passengers, their hopes and dreams.  At times it almost falls into drama while quickly making a retreat back to the comedic genre.  A light-hearted comedy this is not, at every misadventure they come to, as an audience, your heart jumps along.  You wonder if they will make it past this obstacle.  You predict that they will, since it is a comedy after all, then again you probably remember how Life is Beautiful ends.  Can you really make a pure comedy out of such tragedy?This is the aspect that keeps the movie rolling.  The anticipation of what is going to happen next.  The movie contains enough moments to keep you laughing.  However, it is during the moments when nothing happens and the passengers deal with their own issues, that the movie gets interesting.",Train of Life VHS
63850,"Yes, the general consensus is that this movie is terrible.  But this is simply not true.  It may not be comparable to the rest of the Speilberg canon, but thats where the first mistake lies in judging this film.  Its a big dumb comedy filled with slapstick, pratfalls and belly laughs, its not designed to be anything else.  If anyone but Spielberg directed this it would've been better received, I'm sure.  Methinks the wolves were sharpening their knives back in '79, waiting for a glitch in the armor.  That said, John Belushi's histrionics tend to grate, and the Tim Matheson/Nancy Allen subplot is just plain stupid, but thankfully this is an ensemble comedy, and these bits are just small parts of the whole.  As for the DVD, the film looks great, and the bonus materials will give you more info than you ever thought you could handle about the making of 1941.  The making of documentary is feature length in its own right, and it doesnt try to hide the fact that the film was badly received.  In fact, a large portion of the special features Speilberg rightly defending it against its many detractors, explaining that he thinks that its funny. So do I.",1941

Contrast to Kubrick&iexcl;s carried weight and is very difficult, this film is funny and absurd. It is a feature of Carpenter&iexcl;s films; there are many funny scenes, which transcend an imagination. The plot of this film is nothing special. The spaceship crew who have a mission, but their life is a continuity of boredom, so as to their acting is very funny. Childish pranks of the crew and a pet alien which looks like a beach ball with claws, Ii makes people cannot help laughing. In addition, this film was made when Carpenter was a student of university. It was a low-budget film, so some special effects were little bit clumsy. Nevertheless, it deserves to watch because it is a comedy film, so it makes people feel funnier. As watching these scenes, I cannot help recognizing Carpenter&iexcl;s imagination is great. Dan O&iexcl;Bannon who co writes screenplay with Carpenter and played one of the crew, after that he created &iexcl;Alien&iexcl;. This is also interesting thing.

Maybe I wouldn't have bothered to watch it.When I saw this video coupled with Kings of Comedy as a combo, I was hyped. I went to see the Kings @ the MCI Center in DC and it was all of that.

So when I saw the Queens of Comedy, I am thinking, &quot;Wow, I am going to laugh my heart out.&quot; NOOOOOT. The is a crude, boorish movie. The ladies try and make sex talk funny and do not succeed at all. They come off as comedienne has-beens looking for a cheap laugh. What I found sad was that I have seen all of the ladies work (excl.

537384,"There's a great debate among film fans these days as to the proper use and place for special effects in films. Too often, it seems that Hollywood films are built around special effects and action sequences, with scenes featuring actors and plot development as filler.No modern filmmaker is more guilty of that than the director of &quot;Pearl Harbor,&quot; Michael Bay. In all of his previous films (including the excerable &quot;Armageddon&quot;), special effects and action are the point, with human beings tossed in to provide plot references and excuses for sappy Aerosmith ballads.&quot;Pearl Harbor&quot; is no different. Sure, it takes great pains to be historically accurate, and it even makes an attempt (though a lame one) to create a plot based on human relationships that (gasp) isn't punctuated every ten minutes by something exploding.And that might have worked, had the story not been a banal, poorly written romance between three leads who looked as if they were in it for a paycheck. By the time the attack actually happens, it's as if Bay realized he'd put the audience to sleep and needed a big BANG! to wake them up.In any case, the storyline leading up to the titular attack does little but set up the big-time special effects bonanza we know is coming (and soon, we hope, as Ben Affleck flubs yet another line).Compare that to the far more effective approach of &quot;Titanic,&quot; in which the big-time special effects bonanza (the ship's sinking) actually does nothing but tie up the various plots, relationships, and stories that have been told in the first part of the film. The point of the story is to explore the relationships of the people we meet on Titanic, and the sinking is a part of their story.However, in &quot;Pearl Harbor,&quot; the point of the story is to get to the big battle sequences, and the stories of people we meet along the way are meant to kill time until we can get until December 7, 1941.

312626,"Marilyn Monroe proves she really could act in this film, a chilling psychological thriller set in a luxury hotel.  Also starring Richard Widmark and Anne Bancroft, DON'T BOTHER TO KNOCK is a fascinating film.Monroe plays a psychotic babysitter assigned to look after a little girl in a big hotel.  Her past is cloudy and she seems shy and withdrawn.  Also in the hotel in a lounge singer (Anne Bancroft) and her old flame (Widmark).The young man finds his way to the babysitter's room, and she passes herself off as the occupant, wearing a fancy robe and diamond earrings &quot;borrowed&quot; from the girl's mother.He takes a liking to her, but when he discovers her dangling the girl from a window, he decides to call the police.......Monroe gives an emotionally vulnerable performance here.  She is remarkably good, which makes me wonder why studios only gave her &quot;cheesecake movies&quot; instead of the roles and movies she knew she could do.Top shelf entertainment.",Don't Bother to Knock VHS
13036,"Besides the 2 or 3 lulls (especially one BIG one after the rousing start) Godzilla 1998 is an underrated classic. The obvious draw is the top of the heap special effects. I was out of breath during several long scenes that are pumped up versions of several Jurassic Park moments (reminded of the T-rex chase and raptors in the kitchen). There's enough here to justify better ratings than people are giving it. On DVD it's unbelievable. The production values are top drawer in visuals and sound. Believe the double 5 for picture and sound. Spectacular!There is a worm in this apple however. Many people were put off by the ludicrist dialog in some scenes (mostly involving the tv news people). I think scrapping these scenes in favor of something more suspenseful would have been advantageous. They needed to establish several key characters and have them killed to create more tension. Those French guys are like Star Trek &quot;red shirts&quot;. They unfortuanately can't run or get out of the way as fast as a dingy New York Blond and her nerdy worm-lovin boyfriend!Godzilla has its share of genuine laughs too. All of the scenes with the French Foreign Legion were right on target. I loved the poke at the American military who couldn't hit the broad side of a Godzilla. They were best, and funny, busting up the buildings while the big lizard bobbed and weaved like Evander Holyfield. Hilarious!The ending was a good idea-bittersweet. However, they could've went for something more like Jaws (complete with a catch phrase: &quot;This one's for Tokyo!!&quot;).It's ironic that in a time of ultra-realistic special effects that a movie like this can feel at home with its ancestors. Some of us get it and some don't. For the good parts sit back and enjoy...for the not so good have your Mystery Science Theater 3000 buddies over for some laughs.",N/A

293728,"Lance Henriksen and Jeffrey Combs make a gruesome twosome in this horrifying tale of the Spanish Inquisition, presented in director Stuart Gordon's usual style, a mixture of violence, sex, nudity, gore, and very black humor -- in short, a fine witch's brew of a movie!  Henriksen, as far from his portrayal of the emotionless ""synthetic human"" Bishop in ALIENS as he can get, is the Grand Inquisitor Torquemada here, a man driven by his emotions, religious and otherwise, particularly his lust for the accused witch Maria, played by beautiful Rona De Ricci, who must endure a grueling ordeal by her tormentors.  (Making this movie must have been a grueling ordeal for her as well, since she apparently never acted again in anything else!  Very unfortunate for her fans!)Unfortunate, too, is the fact that this DVD seems to have a defect in the Video Zone segment of the bonus features!  This is the most interesting feature (the others are: a lengthy chapter index, trailer, merchandise ads, mini-biographies -- but nothing about Rona De Ricci! -- and website info.) since it has the behind-the-scenes stuff and interviews with Gordon and Henriksen, and maybe others, but I don't know, since it doesn't play well at all!  It skips and freezes at random, and dies!  Very annoying!This also occurs occasionally during playback of the movie itself (yes, I've cleaned the disc, at least half a dozen times, to no effect!) and despite the very good image quality and sound, I can't recommend this DVD.  For this kind of money, everything should work!  Full Moon Pictures, be advised!",N/A

25041,"As other reviews say, this film is outstanding - moving, and unrelentingly true in its depiction of oppressed youth.  Like another classic of French cinema, 'Rififi', it combines realism with lyricism.  Shame then about the quality of the DVD transfer - there is notable and recurrent distortion in the voices (fortunately the music is largely unaffected), and the image lacks clarity and contrast.  At the moment there is no alternative to this (FoxLorber) version, so I would encourage anyone vacillating to buy it anyway - Truffaut's work is that good, and despite obvious shortcomings the transfer remains readily watchable; but it's strange how the classics of cinema fail to receive the technical treatment they deserve.",N/A
499280,"This is without a doubt the most consistently cheerful of all Lanza's seven movies, and a real hoot. The tenor's hitherto-unknown comedic skills are a big surprise, and the film boasts a wonderful supporting cast that includes J Carroll Naish and David Niven. Kathryn Grayson is also back on hand as the romantic interest, and - like Lanza - gets more of substance to sing than in That Midnight Kiss.This is the film that introduced the tenor's signature song, Be My Love. The scene in which the song is first sung (as a duet between Grayson and Lanza) is great fun to watch, with both singers trying to outdo the other, while impresario David Niven watches the pair with startled interest. The climactic Madama Butterfly Love Duet scene is even better, as Lanza throws caution to the wind and shows Miss Grayson the true meaning of passion. As Armando Cesari has amusingly revealed in his recent biography of Lanza, there is more going on in this scene than meets the eye: Kathryn really is not amused by her co-star's ardour!In the role of Pepe Duvall, shrimp fisherman from the Bayou, Lanza plays a character not entirely dissimilar from his own personality, with his lusty ways and thorough lack of pretentiousness. He also sings impressively throughout, with highlights including Libiamo, Libiamo, nei Lieti Calici from La Traviata; and a beautifully rendered Bayou Lullaby, replete with some stunning mezza voce touches.The comic scenes involving Lanza and Carroll Naish are a particular delight. Watching this film today, one is struck by how good the former's comic timing is - especially for a man who had only acted in one picture before this. Arguably the funniest scene of all does not involve Naish, but rather David Niven and Kathryn Grayson. Lanza, trying to play the gentleman in order to impress Miss Grayson, is simply hilarious as he fumbles all the rules of social etiquette on a visit to the latter's home.The movie performed very well at the box office on its release in September, 1950. As with That Midnight Kiss the preceding year, the critics tended to single out Lanza for praise, rather than the film itself. The verdict of Howard S. Thompson, writing in The New York Times, was typical of his peers:""There is no need to continue with the story, not when there is so much enjoyment to be had listening to Mr. Lanza's extraordinarily gifted tenor voice and Miss Grayson's accomplished soprano...Miss Grayson and Mr. Lanza give us just enough in a duet from Madama Butterfly to further the wish that more of the opera had been used.""Following Toast, Lanza would go on to star in The Great Caruso, the pinnacle of his movie career and the film that has inspired more singers than any other in cinematic history.",Toast of New Orleans VHS

393577,"In the 1980s, Eddie Murphy single-handedly recreated the Black Action hero, replacing the old murderous superstud of the 1970s with black characters who depended on their quick wits more than their big guns.  That formula was quickly run dry, however, both by Murphy himself and the imitators he inspired.So, Eddie intelligently decided that he needed to recreate a forgotten genre of comedy, one which Peter Sellars had mastered in the 60s, and which only Murphy could do today: he would make movies in which he played multiple characters. The Genesis began with &quot;Coming to America&quot;, in which Murphy played not only the lead role, but also all the inhabitants of a Harlem barbershop. The sequences were short, but Murphy was building the road to becoming the most brilliant character actor of our day. Soon followed the &quot;Nutty Professor&quot; movies, &quot;Bowfinger&quot;, and his animated TV series, &quot;The PJ's.&quot; In all these Murphy played a multiplicity of roles, and played them all brilliantly (the Academy's disdain for streetwise comedies, and--well, lets just say it--their dismissal of black performers not playing slaves or pimps, are the only explanations possible for Murphy not owning an Oscar or two by now).With these projects, Eddie was not only playing different characters, but also honing a new Eddie Murphy genre: raunchy, but intelligent; gross, but heartfelt; hilariously over the top in the particulars of plot, but firmly rooted in emotional reality. He has created or has been involved with, some of the arguably best comedies of the 1990's and onward--and has been responsible for inarguably the best comic performances of the era.So, in this era, Eddie decided to push the envelope by mixing the new Eddie Genre with the Horror films he loved as a kid. The result, &quot;A Vampire in Brooklyn&quot;, is unsettling to some because the lines between Eddie's wildly improvisational Black (or African American, if you insist) character comedy to straight vampire horror movie are so starkly drawn. There are very few instances where the comedy and horror overlap. This, I feel, is the brilliance of the film. There are no horror moments broken by a punchline or bad joke, and there are no comedy moments punctuated by some kind of sick horror gag (that has been done to death since John Landis' &quot;American Werewolf in London&quot;. Now its being beated to death by &quot;Buffy the Vampire Slayer&quot;). The funny parts are funny and the scary parts are truly scary.  And Murphy also gets to shine in multiple well-defined character parts as well, as the shape-shifting African Vampire assumes the physical identity of several of his victims.&quot;Vampire&quot; failed at the box office not because it was a bad film--its definitely is not. But because it was too unusual a film for the limited abilities of the studio's marketing department to sell. Those going expecting to see a comedy were disappointed it contained so much pure horror, and those going to see it based on the publicity that painted it as a horror film were dissapointed it contained so much hilarious Murphy style comedy. It dies because of false expectations. Eddie's other films contained quick changes in tone as well--the shifts between bathroom comedy and pathos in the Nutty Professor films is no less abrupt than those between horror and comedy in &quot;Vampire&quot;. It's just that the choice of horror as the second element mixed with the comedy is a more daring and unusual one.Years from now, &quot;A Vampire in Brooklyn&quot; will be viewed as one of the highpoints of the second phase of the Eddie Murphy Genre.",Vampire in Brooklyn VHS

438482,"&quot;Job Switching&quot; (Episode #36, September 15, 1952), is the classic episode of  &quot;I Love Lucy&quot; that I always show to my television classes so they know what a classic sit com looks like.  Ricky is tired of the way Lucy spends money without regard for where it comes from, so the boys and girls switch places: Lucy and Ethel will get jobs and Ricky and Fred will do the household chores.  One of the greatest moments in television history comes when Lucy and Ethel have to work a conveyor belt in a candy factory.  Elvia Allman is the supervisor (&quot;Let 'er roll!&quot;) and Amanda Milligan, an actual candy dipper at the Farmer's Market in Hollywood is, uh, the candy dipper.  Meanwhile, Ricky is ironing stockings and making rice while Fred bakes a cake.  Note: The bit Lucy and Ethel do at the job placement service with Alvin Hurwitz is lifted from the two sisters in &quot;Mr. Deeds Goes to Town.&quot;&quot;Lucy and Bob Hope&quot; (#154, October 1, 1956), was the sixth season premier episode.  Ricky has finally managed to buy a controlling interest in the Tropicana club, which he proudly re-names Club Babalu.  Bob Hope has agreed to perform at the opening, but Ricky keeps this little tidbit from Lucy, afraid she will mess things up.  Lucy, worried that Hope will not agree because of her fabled troubles with celebrities, tracks him down at Yankee Stadium to persuade him to do the show.

458597,"The projects of Robin Williams over about the past two and a half years have brought to light what a fantastic actor he really is.Never has a performer been able to interact infantile comedy with dramatic acting so masterfully.But this one just failed to click with me,like his other recent film ,the superb Patch Adams,did.The story is not only off-putting and depressing,but incoherently told,with no structure or involvement.Needless to say as it meanders on towards the end,it starts to get incredibly boring,despite Williams,Annibela Scorria,Cuba Gooding Jr. and Max Von Sydow trying hard.But it's sloppily directed by Vincent Ward.When you see how reliant it becomes on special effects,you know you're in trouble.Wheras Patch Adams was actually a true story,which never tend to be as entertaining as fiction,it carefully timed the comedy and the serious drama moments,which resulted in something great.Here,it is consistently downbeat and overly sentimental,which results in a one dimensional ,thoroughly unappealling affair.To see Williams turn in the best performance of his career,rent Patch Adams,as it's so superior to this.Sorry,I wanted to like it,but it just wasn't possible.",What Dreams May Come VHS
27277,"Set mainly in four homes in a small 1950's Japanese village, Yasujiro Ozu's Good Morning (Ohayo) is an exceptionally wise comedy. It appears outwardly gentle, but hides a great deal of political content. Sure, there are some jokes about bodily functions here, but much of the film's humor comes from the pretense that makes a fart joke a faux pas, not from the flatulence itself. That seems to be Ozu's game. He takes down our defenses by showing us characters that are exceptionally mundane working-class folks, then uses their petty concerns to make broader social commentary. That he seems to think their concerns are petty is a suspicion that occasionally arises, but generally he seems to legitimately care about the characters on display. He takes the camera literally down to the level of a seated character, and his camera looks at them head-on while they speak. He seems to suggest that he's interested in examining these normally unexamined characters, but his stylistic choices could easily be interpreted as condescension. After all, that same focused attention almost feels like a study of these ""common"" people. That he feels compelled to study them so intently suggests he might not quite relate to or understand them.The temptation certainly exists to just read Good Morning as a slice of life tale that shows the foibles of the people in the town, but there may be a bit more to it than that. Although Isamu, the small child who follows his brother throughout the film is adorable, the goal of their protest (they want a television) seems less than noble. Also, Isamu's mimicry appears to be endearing, but isn't it also a tad creepy that he's being led into a strike that he doesn't quite understand? This ambiguity seems to extend to the other characters. Ozu brings up the effects of Japan's mandatory retirement several times during the film. He seems quite critical of the system, as it forces ""retired"" workers to act as door-to-door salespeople that seem to function more as a burden than a service to their customers. Still, when his main adult characters realize their own retirement is impending, they simply shrug it off without any real planning. He doesn't necessarily decry their behavior, but the film almost seems as contemptuous of it as it is of the system that forces the predicament. The film's greatest amount of vitriol is spent condemning the communication gap between generations. Quite simply, the film thinks true communication between generations is impossible. It could be argued that Ozu raises such issues precisely to show that his love for this class of people extends beyond whatever faults they might have. Still, the decision to end many of his scenes the way he does makes the film feel less like a collection of slices of life and more like judgements of that lifestyle. I haven't seen enough of Ozu's to judge his attitudes, but his established reputation as a great cinematic humanist seems somewhat simpleminded. As admittedly funny as it is, Good Morning doesn't seem content to simply giggle at the poor folks, but instead creates a profoundly stated comic view on society. This is a much more complex, ambiguous, and challenging film that most reduce it to. The reason for the 4 star review? The print is less than perfect... Still, a highly recommeded film.",N/A

575033,"Wow... These DVD sets just keep getting better and better. Not only does this set contain what is, in my humble opinion, the best season of the show ever, it also contains some pretty neat extras.Once again Fox has produced beautiful packaging with great artwork and a nice little booklet. The packaging does contain an amusing mistake in the text inside - see if you can spot it... The set folds all the way out to reveal 7 glorious DVDs containing 24 of the best episodes ever to grace our TV screen. The first six DVDs contain the episodes, while the seventh DVD contains all the extras. There are more extras in this set than either of the first two sets. Two of the episodes have director/writer commentary, which is great. The deleted scenes are generally interesting to watch, and the 20 minute documentary is really great. I'm a die-hard x-phile so there's not much I don't know about the show - however, the extras contained a LOT I didn't know.The season as a whole is almost perfect, containing just the right amount of stand-alone and mythology (ongoing storyline) episodes. The season opens with a bang, concluding the major cliffhanger that ended the second season. There is really not a bad episode in the whole bunch, except maybe one or two near the end of the season but the quality of those is debatable.  Writer Darin Morgan contributes the three 'comedy' episodes, all of which work well and one of which (Jose Chung' &quot;From Outer Space&quot;) is my all-time favorite episode EVER.There are some great two-parters here too; &quot;Nisei&quot; / &quot;731&quot; have great action sequences and do a lot to advance the show's ongoing storyline. &quot;Piper Maru&quot; / &quot;Apocrypha&quot; are classic episodes which introduce the mysterious 'black oil', a storyline that continues to this day and was a major feature of the X-Files movie. &quot;Talitha Cumi&quot; is the final episode and is a cliffhanger. Probably not the best season-ender ever but a fine episode nonetheless, and it will definitely make you want to see the conclusion (note: if you can't wait for the season four DVDs to come out, the concluding episode &quot;Herrenvolk&quot; is available on VHS). For Skinner fans there is a great Skinner-centric episode called &quot;Avatar&quot; which was co-written by David Duchovny. And of course there are Mulder-centric (&quot;Grotesque&quot;) and Scully-centric (&quot;Revelations&quot;) episodes.One interesting tidbit of trivia: Lucy Liu of &quot;Ally McBeal&quot; and &quot;Charlie's Angels&quot; fame is one of the guest stars in the episode &quot;Hell Money&quot;. And &quot;D.P.O.&quot; has a great guest performance by Giovanni Ribisi, who has since become quite famous (he has starred in &quot;Friends&quot; and &quot;Saving Private Ryan&quot;).David Duchovny and Gillian Anderson put in a great performance every single episode, and if you can't see the great chemistry they have together then you need to go to your optician immediately. What makes this chemistry even more remarkable is the fact that the two actors have a very frosty relationship off-screen.Bottom line: you NEED this set. It's the most intriguing, consistent, diverse and interesting seasons (although some may disagree) and when you take 24 episodes of the best TV show ever and put them on DVD with great extras and a very reasonable price, you have something that any TV fan should have.Picture quality is better than the first two seasons but some may still be annoyed by the graininess of the image, especially in the dimly-lit scenes, of which there are a lot in this series. Of course, it's vastly better than VHS though and is really not that bad. Please don't let it put you off buying the set. After all, it's the best quality you'll ever see these episodes in.Non x-philes should start with the first season and watch the show in order - you'll get much more out of it if you do it that way rather than just randomly watching episodes or seasons in the wrong order. And for x-philes, what could be better than owning an entire season in one great package? Put this next to your season one and two sets and you'll be one step closer to heaven. I for one am counting the days until the season four DVD set.",The X-Files - The Complete Third Season

At least they fall in love with each other, rather than inflicting themselves on others.  (When it pops up on cable from time to time, I find it curiously watchable, because it has the innocuous blandness and careful inoffensiveness of a good TV show, and sometimes I'm just in the mood for that.

230272,"That's the philosophy lesson we get from Sophia Loren as she waits impatiently for her fiance El Cid (Charlton Heston) to arrive for their wedding. While looking thru the reviews, I saw that someone judged this movie to have an above average script--what do they usually watch, airplane evacuation videos? This is maybe the worst epic I've ever seen, due to a preposterous script and a lot of outlandish acting. El Cid throws a monkey wrench into his wedding plans by refusing to put a group of Moslems to the sword en route to the nuptials. The head of these Moslems really appreciates it, and dubs him &quot;El Cid&quot; while pledging fealty. However, the king of Spain and his court are not so open minded as El Cid, and the upshot is he has to fight a duel with his prospective father-in-law. Suffice it to say that Sophia soon has reasons to have a real grudge against El Cid. So, the movie is about El Cid having to battle Moors for Spanish monarchs he's not too crazy about and about the turbulent love relationship he has with Sophia.  In my opinion, too many love scenes with both actors trying to have their faces in the camera at the same time. Let's face it: most lovers are interested in kissing each other's lips, not smashing their cheeks together like flying buttresses. Somewhat &quot;El Rid&quot;iculous movie.",N/A

The Genesis Project is now very controversial because it is known throughout the galaxy as a very powerful weapon.  Enter the Klingons, led by Christopher Lloyd (in a role that had to have been tailor-made for him).  He battles Kirk for the Genesis Project...and so on.This movie's emphasis on the theme of friendship and sacrifice above all else makes it a winner in the hearts of Trekkers, or anyone with feelings for that matter.  The rescue of Spock and the aforementioned ""sacrifices"" are just as dramatic and haunting as Spock's demise was in part II (there are two really big shockers in this sequel).  The only real weak link in this movie was the replacement of Kirsty Alley by Robin Curtis as Lt. Saavik.  Alley's Saavik in The Wrath of Khan was played surprisingly with a lot of emotion, and that's what made her character likable.  Curtis plays her as being very dry and too ""logical,"" which given who she was in part II, makes no sense. Part III was cleverly directed by Leonard Nimoy who also directed part IV: The Voyage Home.",N/A
553636,"Sisters is the first Hitchcock homage that Brian De Palma launched, and it&#8217;s a doozy. There are scenes in any horror film that put the viewer on edge. Right before the slasher slashes his victim or before the monster eats his prey, a good director will rile us up. Sisters takes Hitchcock&#8217;s famous comment that he plays his audience like a fiddle to heart, and De Palma makes the first forty-five minutes of the film feel like anyone on screen is about to get hacked up, if only the bogeyman would jump out of the shadows. While there are films, like 1994&#8217;s Mute Witness, that offer a similarly distilled horror show, what&#8217;s amazing is that De Palma manages to create the sense of a threat without actually revealing the film as a horror film or showing us much action that&#8217;s in any way dangerous. He&#8217;s obsessing on details and using his camerawork to underline certain dialogue so that we know there must be a point to it all. Obviously, this narrative device has been lifted from Psycho, but it&#8217;s almost one-upped here since Sisters relies on fewer red herrings and is more up-front that we&#8217;re being teased, turning the passing of time without incident into a game instead of a frustration. The events that actually happen in the first half of the movie are so mundane that the suspense feels illogical even as it mounts, and as a result, it has a giddying effect. You know that the director is setting things up, and you can&#8217;t wait for the punch line to rear its head. It&#8217;s almost a shame that it has to end and launch the film&#8217;s plot properly.Once De Palma&#8217;s initial game ends, the film doesn&#8217;t lose much. Sisters becomes an energetic reference to the great scenes and themes of Hitchcock&#8217;s work. Beyond Psycho&#8217;s plot structure, we get Norman Bates&#8217; motivation. Vertigo&#8217;s psychological premise (the obsessive seeker creates the object of obsession in its absence), a body hidden in an apartment (taken from Rope), a Bernard Herrmann score, and Rear Window&#8217;s crime solving via voyeurism also turn up here. Even if the abundance of such themes don&#8217;t manage to make Sisters better than the combined work of Hitchcock, they all integrate well into the tale that the director tells. Certainly, Sisters feels less constrained by the indebtedness caused by creating homage than De Palma&#8217;s later works like Dressed to Kill or Obsession. De Palma&#8217;s constantly winking eye and his juxtapositions of horror and humor keep us interested as the film slides into logical implausibility. Though the performances are solid, the director is clearly the star of this show. As such, Sisters is the first De Palma film that I&#8217;ve seen that I would deem great, and the first one that makes me feel Pauline Kael&#8217;s famously rapturous praise of the director was completely founded*.

580206,"Gluck wrote an Italian version of ""Orfeo"" in 1762 for Vienna. In 1774 he re-wrote a French version for Paris, with ballets and an extended role for Orph&eacute;e. Gardiner chose a French version Berlioz wrote in 1859 for the great mezzo Pauline Viardot. This ""Orph&eacute;e et Eurydice"" opened in the renovated Chtelet together with ""Alceste"", also availavable on DVD. Both were recorded in October 1999 and share similar aesthetics.""Alceste"" too has an early Italian and a later Berlioz version. For ""Alceste"" Gardiner constructed a French hybrid that incorporates elements of the two. For example, the famous aria &quot;divinit&eacute;s du Styx&quot; has a French translation of the Italian version: &quot;ombres, larves.&quot; Why? Ask Gardiner. He also transposed the ""Alceste"" score downward. On both DVD's, his approach is fresh, idiomatic and unforced. His fast tempi balance the dreamy pace of action on the stage. He loves sprightly rhythms and now and then an abrupt chord.The still very young Czech mezzo Magdalena Ko&#x17E;en&aacute; (Orph&eacute;e) has a pleasant voice of exceptional sheen and beauty, a good command of the coloratura with delicious lightness, agility and clear diction. However, she lacks the necessary depth. The demands of the role surpass her experience, evidenced by a deficiency in the lower registers that sometimes breaks her musical line. These problems in the passaggio are particularly evident in the challenging ""Amour vient rendre &agrave; mon me"" with its tessitura spread over three registers (27:00, in the trills), added by Berlioz especially for Viardot. American soprano, Madeline Bender (Eurydice), dressed in a virginal white gown, has a smooth, crystal tone. French soprano, Patricia Petibon is a delightful Amour. All three are quite ravishing. Paradoxically, the exquisite Ko&#x17E;en&aacute; suffers from ugly makeup that is supposed to give her a certain masculine hue.Robert Wilson, an American originally from Texas, active mostly in European opera houses, directs both productions. Under his direction the singers move in a highly stylized and ritualistic choreography inspired by the Japanese Nh theatre tradition. A section of the French public booed him loudly. This was echoed by French critics. They panned his approach and made vaguely suspicious references to his Texan origins. English and German critics liked and defended him from this lukewarm reception.Wilson is known as a minimalist. He presents the action as a series of tableaux that flow naturally from one to the other. Orph&eacute;e and his spouse move about the stage looking something like ancient Egyptian bas-reliefs. The famous ""Ballet des Ombres Heureuses"" and ""Danse des Furies"" are tableaux devoid of dancers, with a few shifting shadows of the chorus in the background, plus a few abrupt lighting changes. Both the ""Alceste"" and the ""Orph&eacute;e"" share a projected cube that floats near, approaches and departs again. I find it amazing how communicative this device is, despite its abstractness. It is evocative of the power of fate, descending arbitrarily from the air to threaten the loving pairs in the two works.  The Ancient Greeks' concept of fate is not immediately accessible to the modern mind. Yet, Wilson dramatizes it in a visceral way that is completely modern. He is truly a genius of the 21st Century. Unlike other productions, ravaged by the excesses of ignorant and megalomaniac directors, espousing post-modernism, minimalism, or any other faddish -ism, this unique collaboration between Gardiner and Wilson produces a consistent musical-dramatic unit.Despite this, I must admit that initially both productions struck me as detached, contrived, devoid of rubato and under-whelming. I rarely  bother to listen to anything written before 1812, being  heavily invested in the romantic and post romantic repertoire. It is only on repeat viewing that I was able to appreciate the wonders of these productions. If you approach them in a fairly suggestible mood, the experience can be (and has been) described as ""hypnotic."" From the moment the blue square enlarges to encompass the action on stage you enter an enchanted world. The set, merely a rock and a few poplar trees in silhouette, is bathed in the same cerulean color as Orph&eacute;e's costume. This ever present blue is reminiscent of the azure of the endless heavens or that of the Aegean Sea, pristine in its primordial beauty. I couldn't tear myself from the screen.The characters too, seemed to be hypnotized, or even bewitched. Wilson's approach has given rise to various interpretations. I read of one viewer who felt that the characters moved slowly and artificially as if their movements were controlled by the gods. Only the god Amour has the freedom to move with spontaneity. Another thought that the unisex costuming and makeup emphasized the femaleness of Ko&#x17E;en&aacute; and Petibon, which gave the tale an intriguing Saphic slant. For me, the action took place in an arctic dream world, cast in an eerie light, inhabited by almost frozen figures residing on the edge of death.Where these productions take you is highly personal. It has been an insidiously enticing operatic experience for me. Wilson dissolves your defenses by seduction rather than by force.Many operatic productions lose their power in the transition from the stage to the small screen. These two works seem perfect for television because the heightened artificiality, often an unwanted effect, is at the core of the stylistic language here. The intensity of the experience is ironically heightened in this case by the intimacy that this medium provides. Another advantage of the DVD is that the lack of projection of the voices, always a problem with Chtelet acoustics, is easily solved here. Like all the other Chtelet DVD's, these two have an almost perfect picture quality.As a final note, I am curious to see Wilson apply his approach to Wagner's ring. He may be able to make dramatic sense of its warring gods, without reducing them into ""symbols"" of one kind or another.",N/A
528318,"2000 was a very dull year for film but &quot;Dancer In The Dark&quot; made it worth it. First let me start by saying two things to prove that this won't be a biased review; 1.I hate most musicals(I can stand a few like &quot;Cabaret&quot;) 2.I like Bjork but I'm not a big fan. I don't want to touch too much on the plot because I had no clue what the film was about when I went to see it and I'm glad I did. The themes in the film are many, touching on everything from single mothering and the death penalty. The style of the film overall reminds me of Bertolt Brecht's plays. Most of the characters are very alienated and the singing and dancing are always upbeat on a dismal subject and aren't sung to sound pretty and clear. The last number in the film with in context of what was going on is the most Brechtian scene I've seen outside Brecht and Churchill's Mad Forest play. The story is very tragic but I wasn't crying at the end. It's the same technique Brecht was trying to use in his plays. The film doesn't indulge in being too avant garde and arty, it keeps a perfect balance of creativity and straight forwardness. I won't say too much more because I want you to fully experience this film without knowing too much. My choice for best film of 2000.",N/A

257169,"This film came out in 1979 and seems to get better every year.  It is the bizarre story of a blank slate of a gardner who literally has never been outside of the walls of a single house until he is in his 40s or 50s.  The entire view of this man comes from watching television.The basic story is quite simple. As Chance the gardner is forced to leave the house he has lived in as a child, he is hit by a limosine transporting the wife of a dying plutocrat.  Taken to the home of the plutocrat, he eventually meets the rich and powerful of the land (the president included)and is taken to be an oracle of wisdom with his simple statements about gardening and the television he has watched. It is a great satire that just keeps getting better as we rely more and more on soundbites for our information.The best part of the film is Peter Sellers who plays this absolutely blank, innocent, and slow-witted person with complete aplomb.  I remember an interview with Sellers when the movie came out, and he said it was a real struggle to develop an accent that had no roots at all -- a perfect blend of voices heard on television.  He plays the movie absolutely straight, the comedy being how people react so seriously to his child-like comments.  For example, in a television interview about the economy, people take his comments that &quot;there is always growth in the spring&quot; to mean an end to a recession when he is simply talking about his garden.This is a unique film with lots and lots of subtle humor (no slapstick ala Clouseau). There are some very funny moments as people react to Peter Sellers, but the humor always comes back to how we choose to see the world. There is no deception of the part of the character of the gardner -- it is everybody else who plays the fool here.This is a definitely a movie to own and to watch over and over. I know some people who have found it a bit slow, in that very little really happens -- it is almost a comedy of manners. It is a great memorial to Peter Sellers from one of his very last movies.",Being There VHS
428302,"That exchange in &quot;The Adventures of Robin Hood&quot; was first drawn to my attention because it was used in the frontspiece of a trashy book about Flynn's being a secret Nazi spy. Well, I don't know whether he was a spy or not, but Errol Flynn was the best swashbuckler I've ever seen, and this movie is the crowning acheivement of his career--maybe one of the ten greatest films released by Warner Brothers, too.While Flynn is the star, I must admit that my love for this film is rooted not to his performance, but to those of Basil Rathbone and Claude Rains. After all this time, I still can't determine which actor does the better job. Rathbone is Sir Guy, Robin Hood's nemesis, who hates him not only because Robin is a threat to the usual evil usurper plans, but because he senses correctly that Maid Marion is in love with Robin Hood. His striking good looks are used to full advantage--in some scenes, such as when Robin is sentenced to hang, Rathbone actually looks like a figure in an El Greco painting. And of course, there's his skill with a sword. The prolonged duel at the film's conclusion would never have been as good if Rathbone weren't so agile and malicious. When my three-year-old nephew happened to see this scene, he became hopelessly hooked on swords and armor! (Although, to be sure, Robin and Guy wear no armor in this scene, but toddlers tend to overgeneralize sometimes.)As for Claude Rains, he's a wickedly good actor! His Prince John is a wily schemer, overthrowing his brother's regent by playing on others' greed for advancement. He himself never lifts a sword, but he manages to get very far on the metal and mettle of his co-conspirators. Just listen to the way the words just trip off his tongue: he's one jaded Plantagenet, all right.It's a beautiful-looking film, too, as if a Howard Pyle or NC Wyeth book just popped up and came to life. The costumes, the sets, the cinematography--everything comes  together for a feast for the eyes. Topping it off, Erich Wolfgang Korngold's Oscar-winning score underlies every scene magnificently.If you're looking for a film for a special family holiday or a romantic evening with your honey, or just a night in by yourself with a pizza and a pint of ice cream, look no further than &quot;The Adventures of Robin Hood&quot;--and by St. George, you'll see I'm right on target!",N/A

185776,"Through composiotion, in which every line of dialogue is sung, is common enough in opera, but rare in musicals; for most fans of theater and movies, &quot;Evita&quot; was the first example of this stylistic technique they'd ever seen. But long before &quot;Evita&quot;, Jaques and Michel Legrand pioneered this style in &quot;The Umbrellas of Cherbourg&quot;. At first it's a little jarring. Mechanics in a garage are washing up, and singing to each other as they do. &quot;What are you doing tonight?&quot; &quot;I'm going dancing. What are you doing?&quot; It seems all very unnatural. But very quickly the viewer adjusts to the style, and it begins to seem not at all unusual.Legrand's music is of course wonderfully lyrical, and the combination of the music, the pastel colors that dominate the sets and the soft lighting result in a look not unlike the great MGM musicals- though with a very French feel. The story is a perfect tragic romance; boy and girl fall in love, they're seperated, and find love elsewhere- while still remembering each other. The entire cast are warm and sympathetic, and Catherine Deneuve in her first major role is breathtakingly beautiful.If you love musicals, and you like the classic post-war French cinema, you'll find in this film the perfect synthesis of the two genres.",N/A

Both versions are complete american versions(the european version of Utopia is longer than the american version) but until that version is available this will sufice. Granted Utopia all around is generally a bad film, but compared to their 1940-1945 films at MGM and 20th Century Fox where they had no say or control on the films they were making, it in a way shows some of thier old style and gags from their Hal Roach films. Stan Laurel was very ill during production and it definitely shows in his appearance and he later regretted completing this film.

132912,"'You can count on me' is the indie movie 'Friends', where prickly situations about families and relationships waft in a feel-good haze.  A case in point is the crucial bout of violence.  The films of Shane Meadows usually feature such a scene, which have a tendency to break the fragile nature of the home or society in which it is played out.  It's either bleakly final (24:7) or desperately covered up ('A Room For Romeo Brass').  Director Lonergan doesn't quite have the courage of this scene, and neuters it with tears, big smiles and hugs.  This is symptomatic of the film as a whole, where even the mumbling are prodigiously articulate.  And yet, deep down, the film's circular pattern, where a couple representing Happy Family  die in a car, and a couple representing Family That Can't Live Together drive apart, suggests more searching themes.  If the excellent Matthew Broderick had been central, you'd have had a more troubling film.",N/A

207845,"Now we come to what is clearly the most famous, most admired and most controversial Star Trek episode, &quot;The City on the Edge of Forever.&quot;  As I would think most people know by know, McCoy goes back in time through the time portal of the Guardian of Forever and changes history.  Kirk and Spock follow to set things right, ending up in the U.S. during the Great Depression where they learn that the focal point in time is Edith Keeler (Joan Collins), a social worker: Because McCoy will save her life, Edith will lead a peace movement that will delay U.S. involvement in World War II, allowing Hitler time to create the atomic bomb first and win the war (which is not a good thing).  Unfortunately, Kirk falls in love with Edith and does not want her to die.Originally written by Harlan Ellison, who has published both the original script and his side of what really happened (that's an understatement), the only thing everybody can agree on is that changes were made in the script.  The biggest difference in the two versions has to do with which character prevents Edith from being saved: in the episode it is Kirk, but in the original script it is Spock.  Ellison's point was that Kirk was willing to sacrifice the future for love; the powers that be maintained their hero would not act that way.  But then they also think that two hundred years from now no one will remember Clark Gable (or &quot;Gone With the Wind&quot; apparently).Ironically, these two opinions are enshrined in the second and third Star Trek movies, where we go from the good of the many outweighs the good of the one (Spock sacrifices live to save the ship), to the good of the one outweighs the good of the many (Kirk save Spock at the expense of his career).  I have to admit that I very much like both versions; it was years before I stopped crying when I watched the end of &quot;The City on the Edge of Forever.&quot;  Yet as great as that ending is, with Kirk having nothing to say about what has happened except &quot;Let's get the hell out of here,&quot; what Ellison was attempting was even more operatic.Ultimately, what hurts this episode the most is not the great debate over which version is superior, but that Kirk would have a different girl on a different planet for what seemed like every other episode during the rest of the series, which undermines his (supposedly) epic love for Edith Keeler.  If you have not read Ellison's script, then you should do so.  You can even skip the vitriolic account of the bad blood between Ellison and Gene Roddenberry, but there is a minor character named Trooper in the script who deserves to be remembered because he was deemed negligible by history.","Star Trek - The Original Series, Episode 28: The City On the Edge Of Forever VHS"

348444,"I'd heard about THE HIDDEN FORTRESS as a young man whenever the roots of STAR WARS were discussed.  FORTRESS is always mentioned as the film that influenced George Lucas the most in crafting his STAR WARS films.  It wasn't until last year that I actually decided to rent it and see what it and its director Akira Kurosawa were all about. THE HIDDEN FORTRESS was my first introduction to the incredible direction of Akira Kurosawa. I've gone on to watch several of his other films and am now a huge fan. I also discovered that quite a few Hollywood movies have their roots in Kurosawa films.  Interestingly enough, an interview with George Lucas has been included on the disk as a bonus, which completes the HIDDEN FORTRESS/STAR WARS connection.FORTRESS is a fast-moving film.  It's story is reminiscent of the serials of the 1930's (including &quot;wipes&quot; to transition from scene to scene -- again, another technique that Lucas borrowed for STAR WARS).  Our heroes leap out of frying pan into fire on several occasions.The Japanese style of acting (at least in 1958 when this film was made) is very stylized and  little over the top or &quot;stagey&quot;.  However, the stylized performances only add to the wonderful, other-worldly atmosphere of HIDDEN FORTRESS.  That's one thing that I enjoyed about this Kurosawa film:  it definitely takes the viewer to a world he has not seen before ... a weird, ancient and savage old-Japan.Those are my thoughts on this film.  This was the first Kurosawa I ever saw and I was very impressed.  Immediately I rented YOJIMBO and HIGH AND LOW and SEVEN SAMURAI and went on to be a fan.",The Hidden Fortress VHS
374262,"I wish I could give this film four and a half stars because it almost deserves five.  Some people will argue that this picture has no point and is light on story.  I totally disagree.  The message of this film is simple: if you are dissatisfied with your situation in life, stop complaining and do something to improve things.  The main character, Dante, is incapable of changing his life for the better.  Although he is sick of working at a convenient store and making nothing of himself, he has a tremendous fear of change.  Randall, who is seemingly afraid of nothing and operates the video store across the street, lacks the desire to do something more important with his life.  Both characters are smart malcontents who are obviously not getting nearly enough out of their potential.  Randall's poor treatment of the video store customers may irritate some of the film's viewers, but as a former video store employee who knows how stupid those types of customers can be, I found his behavior hilarious and I could certainly relate to it.  In a way, Randall is the person everyone would like to be -- rude, obnoxious, unafraid to piss stupid people off, outspoken, and irresponsible.  Dante, however, represents the type of person most of us are -- compromising, reluctant to take big steps in life, scared of confrontation, and dissatisfied with life.  Clerks is one day in the life of two kids in their early twenties and the bizarre events that happen around them.  The dialogue is great and the fact that the acting is not always great seems to actually help the movie in some strange way.  The black and white in which the film is shot is probably indicative of the dull lives these young clerks live, although there is nothing dull about this day.  Without a doubt, Kevin Smith's best film.  The cathartic speech Randall delivers to Dante at the end of the film makes for the perfect ending and adds a level of depth to the picture.  Though the awful language employed by the characters will not be enjoyed by many older viewers, Gen-Xers can certainly relate to the unique jargon used by those in the picture.

135785,"The inimitable Peter Sellers strikes again as Chief Inspector Jacques Clouseau, in this fourth installment of the classic ""Pink Panther"" series, ""The Pink Panther Strikes Again,"" directed by Blake Edwards.  Given the fact that the assessment of comedy is intrinsically subjective, this film is arguably laugh for laugh and sight gag for sight gag the funniest of the five (followed closely by the second of the series, the hilarious farce, ""A Shot In The Dark).  In this one, former Chief Inspector Dreyfus (Herbert Lom) is about to be released from the mental hospital-- in which he has resided since being driven crazy by Clouseau-- when on the very afternoon of his hearing he is visited by none other than Clouseau himself, who has come to speak on behalf of his former boss.  Suffice to say that by the time Clouseau is through ""helping,"" he is driven from the premises by the relapsed, raving madman, Dreyfus.  And it's only the beginning of the inept French Inspector's antics that, before it is over, will include a trip to the Ocktoberfest, encounters with a dozen hit-men from around the world, a beautiful Russian spy named Olga (Lesley-Anne Down), a surprise Egyptian spy (who will remain nameless) and a one-man assault on a castle.  As Laurel and Hardy proved so many times before, for every action there is a reaction; a theorem of which proof is unequivocally provided here by the relationship between Sellers and Lom.  This was the film in which Edwards and his stars not only further devised, but honed to perfection, their foolproof formula for laughs:  After the ""first wave"" of hilarity provided by Sellers, it is followed up-- in just enough instances to be totally effective-- by Lom's reaction to 1.)  Sellers directly (as in the first, classic scene at the mental hospital), or 2.)  Lom's reaction to Seller's antics as they are related to him by a third party.  It's a one-two punch that never fails and which, in effect, derives twice the fun from a single gag.  And it's brilliant.  But at the end of the day, it must be noted that there is one element above all else that accounts for the success of this film, and that, of course, is the Man himself, Peter Sellers.  Sellers must be regarded as-- if not ""the,"" then at least one of the-- funniest actors ever to grace the silver screen.  There was no end to the ways he could make you laugh; from the subtlest expression-- an eye averted or perhaps the slight raising  of an eyebrow-- to the broadest slapstick, it was all within his personal domain, and he was the Master.  Physically, practically all he had to do to get a laugh was show up; consider the scene in which he arrives at the hospital to visit Dreyfus:  As he saunters across the lawn of the vast grounds surrounding the buildings, a croquet mallet and ball lying to one side catches his eye; there is just the slightest hesitation in his step, the subtlest change of expression in his eyes and the merest inclination of the head.  And there, in that briefest of moments upon the screen, you know-- beyond the shadow of a doubt-- what is about to transpire.  And you're right; a moment later Clouseau has the mallet in his hand and his foot on the ball, and even as it's happening-- just as you knew it would in that split second before it did-- he has you on the floor laughing.  That was the gift-- and the genius-- of Peter Sellers.  Was every film he made a classic?  A great film?  Of course not; but you would be hard put to find a single performance of his, even in a bad film (Like 1970's ""There's A Girl In My Soup""), that did not embody that unique spark that defined him.  It was certainly alive in his portrayal of Clouseau (possibly the definitive Seller's character), and in retrospect, what a shame it seems that there were only five ""Panther"" movies ever made.  But so it is, and shall ever be.  The supporting cast includes Burt Kwouk (as the ever faithful and attacking manservant, Cato), Andre Maranne (Francois), Colin Blakely (Alec Drummond), Leonard Rossiter (Inspector Quinlan), Richard Vernon (Dr. Fassbender), Briony McRoberts (Margo) and Michael Robbins (Jarvis).  A funny movie that showcases one of Cinema's truly unique and funny actors, ""The Pink Panther Strikes Again"" is a side-splitting, fun movie you can watch over and over and never grow tired of.  The best of the series, it stands as a glowing tribute to the comedic genius of Peter Sellers.",N/A

There isn't anything about the characters you find out 2 hours after you watched it that you didn't realize after the first five minutes of the film.  A &quot;brilliant&quot; student experiments with alcohol and that's about it.Go to a rocky cliff with a friend who can't hold his/her liquor, get them boozed up and watch the results.  It will be much more entertaining than this production.After wasting nearly two hours of my life watching this production and pleading to the motion picture gods that something would actually occur (heaven forbid), I was left motionless.Trust me on this, nothing happens in this movie.  it isn't about anything at all...and that's really disappointing when you consider a man who brought you something as great as 'LA Confidential' was behind this mess.

Helen breaks her abusive relationship and Spacey gets over himself.  Osment tragically dies.

157099,"Killer Klowns?  From Outer Space?  Actually, they are bloodsucking extraterrestrials that look like circus klowns who invade a Kalifornia kollege town and, using innocuous-looking circus props, spin local folks into kotton kandy-like kacoons to preserve them for later konsumption.Yes, much of the acting is hammy and overdone.  Yes, the premiss is outrageous, and yes, the actual plot is rather thin.  But all that doesn't really matter; it only adds to the charm of this flick.  Using an exaggerated blend of the same horror-and-humor mix that made movies like BRIDE OF FRANKENSTEIN and AN AMERICAN WEREWOLF IN LONDON such memorable classics, KILLER KLOWNS FROM OUTER SPACE is actually a hilarious send-up of both sci-fi alien-invader stories and horror splatter flicks.  All in all, it's a very entertaining 1980s-era klassic replete with real thrills and genuine laughs.The effects, props, and sets in KILLER KLOWNS are zany yet very cool eye candy, and the alien klowns are truly memorable and frightening villains.  The Chiodo Brothers and their crew do a top-notch job in creating a genuine circus atmosphere, yet they keep the audience constantly aware that something sinister is lurking inside every circus ride, balloon animal, and ball of cotton candy.  The eponymous killers exude this same dichotomy: At first glance, they look like goofy, brightly colored circus clowns, yet closer examination reveals that they are quite gruesome looking and downright scary.  Anyone with a genuine fear of clowns (coulrophobia) will freak!This DVD edition of this flick is a penny pincher's delight!  Not only is it reasonably priced, but it comes packed with extras like deleted scenes, theater trailer, interviews with the Chiodo Brothers and other crew members, and much more.  One of the most interesting extras is an 8mm home movie--complete with a fur-covered GI Joe villain--made by the Chiodo Bros when they were in high school!  Anybody who was an aspiring movie maker in their youth will get a real kick out of that one.This is definitely one of the best of the MGM Midnight Movie series.

The film is accurate and entertaining, but not exactly the most exciting movie of the year. Frankly, as the film starts, its boring. But, as the characters develop and the story neatly unfolds, The Dish becomes a light and enjoyable experience. The film gives us comedy without being too in-your-face.

The script is very funny and well-written -- dialogues are a bit Kevin Smith-esque, but more genuine and less over-the-top. Jokes work because the actors don't sound like they are just reading their lines. Interesting note: I had a chance to attend Q&A; session with Jenniphr Goodman (the director/co-writer), Duncan North (real-life Dex/co-writer) and Donal Logue (who plays our slacker lothario to perfection) at the Seattle Film Festival, and apparently very little, if any, of the movie was improvised. Donal said since it was written by ""real"" people (as opposed to those non-human screenwriters ;) he felt natural saying the lines that were given to him.Despite a rather predictable ending, ""Tao of Steve"" is a super fun movie -- something worth keeping around for occasional viewings.",The Tao of Steve

The Mosquito was an exceptional aircraft, and 633 Squadron deserves praise for showcasing it.As for the rest of the film, the story line staggers and doesn't fully develop.  The end of the film does provide an exciting bombing run that results in the destruction of a Nazi fuel factory in a Norwegian fjord.

566045,"You wouldn't think so, but Jon Favreau and Famke Janssen have a great deal of on-screen chemistry. I also would not guess that Janssen had the comedic abilities that she displays in this film. The film chronicles a relationship between Favreau and Janssen in its various stages from meeting to the first parts of the relationship to the tough times the break-up, the post break-up trying to make each other jealous, and if I am not mistaken, they do reconcile in the end? It has been about a year since I saw this film, so forgive me if I am wrong. I do know they at least end up as friends. While the concept of the film is nothing new, there is something fresh and charming about the way their relationship develops and how the characters perceive their lives and themselves within and outside of their relationship. Both characters are endearing in their own ways, and you genuinely feel what each is going through. (Also this film boasts a good soundtrack).",N/A
520748,"This film was stellar and I am so thrilled to know that the makers were wise enough to do all three films at the same time because this cast and director, these incredible sets and locations are perfect!  I've read the Trilogy three times ( a relative few times, I realize.)  I have loved it for nearly four decades and I consider it the best book ever written and so I was worried that the film would not measure up.  It did!Any nitpicking about the plot changes and the development of the Lady Arwen's character are just that...nitpicking.  This is an ADAPTATION and so editing it down to a convenient size without losing the power and flow of the story was a difficult task, I am sure.  No, we do not see Old Man Willow or Tom Bombadil and Goldberry.  If the Barrow Downs scene would have been included and done well it would have taken another 1/2 hour alone.  We don't visit with Farmer Maggot either, but remember this is an adaptation and we cannot be literal minded if we hope to enjoy this film.  What we are given is fabulous! The Lady Arwen is placed in the scene at the Ford of Bruinen rather than Glorfindel but it works as well and gives Arwen a much more rounded character that will later be important to our understanding of Aragorn and Elves in general. It works and her newly enlarged character is breath-taking and so beautifully played by Liv Tyler.  The casting was, all in all, magnificent and the make-up and hair and costumes were brilliant.  These characters meshed well with the perceptions I had in my head as a result of reading the books. My one fault with casting was in the character of Elrond played by Hugo Weaving.  Weaving does a good job and his fine bone structure is very Elvish in appearance and the strength in his voice is appropriate, but unfortunately at least for this part, Weaving's previous role in &quot;The Matrix&quot; tainted him too much to make him acceptable. The vibration of malignancy from &quot;The Matrix&quot; role spilled over into this role and Elrond should not have a whiff of malignancy about him however faint.  I am easily willing to accept that tiny flaw because of the excellence of all the rest of the cast. My favorites are Orlando Bloom as Legolas, Billy Boyd as Peregrin Took, Sean Astin as Samwise Gamgee. These three manage to stand out in a brilliant cast and their acting is just a dead-ringer for their literary counterparts. I thought I might object to the pointed ears that were given to the Elvish folk in this film because the books never describe Elves as having pointy ears, but it works well, actually, and gives just the right flavor of the Fey to these people without making them in the least like Santa's helpers as I had feared.The Shire IS the Shire in this film. Isengard and the tower of Orthanc are right on and the depiction of Khazad-dum was deep and heavy with doom and magnificence. Satisfying.This movie flowed swiftly and was totally engrossing at every  moment. The characters drew you in and made you believe in them. The bits that were spoken in the Elvish tongue with subtitles added to the film rather than detracting as some subtitles can do. The film succeeded in being great in its own right and able to stand alone as a film even for people who have not read the books.  I expect it will draw legions of new fans to the books.I am thoroughly pleased with the results of all this movie magic and I bow to the creators of &quot;Lord of the Rings&quot;. I offer them my sword. Let no one pass who would naysay their Majesties.",The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring
424990,"It paints a very frank picture of the ugly nature of politics and begs for just one honest man to make a difference. James Stewart is flawless and absolutely irreplacable as that man - Jeff Smith. The stellar Capra stable of players from Jean Arthur to Edward Arnold to H. B. Warner are pitch perfect. But my special favorite may in fact be Claude Rains, who plays an honest man gone bad with such conflict and realism that he makes a potentially cartoon ""villain"" feel all the more palpably plausible. This is why ""Mr. Smith"" may be the ne plus ultra of idealistic films but it is not unrealistic. And I have yet to see any film sustain a half hour that matches this film's third act - the filibuster - in intensity and exaltation.It's interesting to see how the reviews here reveal the film as a Rorschach test for viewers' political leanings. One sees it as taking a stand AGAINST the liberal Democrats in power at the time, another as raising an alarm AGAINST Republican business interests controlling corrupt politicians. That's funny, because I always thought the film was FOR something, that it was a monument to the American ideals of truth, justice, equality, and the common good - regardless of party.One more thing: It disheartens me to read comments about how ""cheesy"" this film is and how all the idioms of the 1930s make it unwatchable. I think these writers are incapable of appreciating any culture but their own. They would probably go to Spain and make fun of the people that speak Spanish. Even though it's set in the US, this movie takes place in a different culture: Depression-era America. Back then, people knew when you were ""full of hooey"" and called you a ""crackpot"" to let you know it.",Mr Smith Goes to Washington VHS
529546,"TRAFFIC, helmed by Steven Soderbergh (OUT OF SIGHT) triumphs in its documentary narration of how drugs have devastated and rooted in America. The 3 simple stories are linked together, each offering different perspective on the critical issue. Benicio Del Toro plays sublimely to effect a Mexican cop who witnesses the death of his buddy to drug syndicate. The power of drugs lead to intense and volatile obsession and violence as greed reign even amongst the politcal kingdom in Mexico. Michael Douglas plays an American senator who has taken over the Drugs Office to raid out drug trafficking, only to ironically discover his daughter has been abusing drugs. Family conflicts and emotions run high in this story and the climax is shattering and most heart-rendering. Don Cheadle and Luis Guzman portray undercover cops who is on the chase for a drug lord and when he is arrested, Catherine Zeta Jones as his wife takes over his business to support their child.TRAFFIC is in fact this year's most outstanding film in terms of direction and acting. The ensemble elevates the intense atmosphere with their seasoned acting and the direction gives it an exciting documentary vision which stimulates reality. The story-telling builds up with a climax and is acutely thought -provoking without preaching morals. It leave the audience to think and dissect the world of drugs, though the insight is not really there yet. However, as a movie, it is unequivocally this year's best - it puts the motion in picture with Soderbergh's direction and leaves the audience hopelessly addicted to it.",N/A
522835,"Most of the time, ... reviewers tend to exaggerate how bad something is. In this case however, that is not the fact. This movie has an average 3-star rating, but it's much worse than that. The plot for this movie is just another played out Hollywood theme that is executed rather poorly. The thought of Jim Carrey playing a man with two personalitys excited me. Jim did a decent job at his role, but his performance is overshadowed by the stupidy of the plot. The Farrelly brothers are the lone bright spot in this film, and their place in the plot was pretty much the only funny thing is this movie. This movie does not have the same PG-13 feel of ""The Mask"" or ""Liar Liar"", it is rated R for a reason.If you go out and rent this expecting something as good as ""Dumb and Dumber"" or ""Kingpin"", you are in for a real suprise because those films are in a completely out of the league of this movie.

425993,"Fist of Legend is arguably my favorite movie (rivaling ""Top Gun,"" ""The Long Kiss Goodnight,"" and ""Superman"").  What appealsto me about it is that it takes itself seriously; the movie actually has a worthwile storyline instead of the usual super silly, comic, slapstic antics that typically occur in Chinese cinema (consider ""Once Upon a Time in China"" or ""Fong Sai Yuk"" aka ""The Legend"").  The wire work in such movies usually spoils the action for me, too.  If there is any wire work in ""Fist of Legend, however, it is not at all apperent.  What makes an action movie entertaining is its ability to convince the audience that it isn't a movie.  Seeing ""Fist of Legend"" makes me believe that what Jet Li does on camera is the same as what he does in real life.The fight sequences in this movie are also much more ""down to earth"" than in other typical Chinese movies.  We don't see the hero, Chen Zan, for example, knocking out fifty OTHER kung fu masters with a single swing of a quarterstaff (as in ""Twin Warriors"").  Instead, when confronted by multiple assailants, he has to fight to disable each one as quickly as possible by breaking their arms and legs etc.All in all, ""Fist of Legend"" combines fantastic, yet realistic kung fu action with a good story and great conflict....",Fist of Legend VHS

580435,"There are very few films about vampires, much less about Dracula, that I enjoy or will endorse. 1922's Nosferatu is ground-breaking and stunning for its time, and Werner Herzog's 1979 remake is simply the best of the genre. I heard about the film &quot;Shadow Of The Vampire, but basically ignored it, thinking it was just another sad attempt at cashing in on a far too trite genre. However a while later, I took a chance and purchased &quot;Shadow Of The Vampire&quot; on video, brought it home and watched it. Needless to say, I was impressed and amazed how good this film is! How could there yet be another film about Nosferatu that is original and worth watching, I kept saying to myself? Well, this movie prooves that there is, as well as how there can be.&quot;Shadow Of The Vampire&quot; is a film within a film; a story within a story. It is a film about the crew and director and players who made the original 1922 Nosferatu--but it is not a docu-drama. It is an orginal story of fiction that touches on non-fiction.The movie is full of grace, elegance, atmosphere, wit, and refinement. The acting performances, particularly by Willem Dafoe and John Malkovich, are superb and brilliant. The musical score is tasteful and effective.&quot;Shadow Of The Vampire&quot; isn't a particular scary film, but it certainly does get creepy at times, and can be quite disturbing.

50467,"Harper Lee must have loved her Daddy and big brother.  Her warm fictional remembrance of them as Atticus and Jem in To Kill a Mockingbird is filled with respect and love.  She had a story to tell of race and hatred and tolerance and understanding, but underpinning all of it is her love of the two central males of her childhood, her kind and wise father, and her loving, protective brother.  This is the heart of her book, and it is the heart of this faithfully adapted film of that book.In an age that usually draws males and females in broad caricatures, depicting brutishness and carnality as the norm, and crassness and &quot;in-your-face&quot; as the only form of honesty, the characters in Mockingbird are not only refreshing, they are a revelation.The book and the film is largely about decency.  Simple human decency.  The characters in this story of childhood adventures, awakenings and surprises, with the trial of an innocent black man in the South of the 30's at its center, are by and large decent people.From Scout's father, Atticus, sincerely defending the man, to the Judge wanting a fair trial and result, to the defendant Tom and his family, to Cal the housekeeper, to the lady next door, to the Reverend, to the simple and plain but honest Sheriff, and even the farmer momentarily caught up in the lynch mob mentality....all are essentially decent people struggling within their society's preconceived assumptions and intolerances to do what's right. And, of course, there is Boo.Yes, the world has its share of ignorant, cowardly, and hate-filled Bob Ewells.  But, they do not define the world, so long as there are good men and women striving to do the right thing.This flawlessly cast movie is a masterpiece.  It captures the innocense and wonder of childhood, and the sometimes tragedy &amp; struggle of adulthood without preaching. The performances are first rate down to the smallest role.  Robert Mulligan manages to capture the world from a child's perspective without belaboring it.The world has spun around a few times since I saw this movie on it's release when I was little more than a child myself.

The story takes place immediately after the first, as in most Rob Zemckis sequels.  Marty McFly Just got back from the 50's from saving his parent's fate and his in the time traveling DeLorean that Doc Brown created.  But before Marty and Girlfriend Jennifer can relax, Doc shows up saying that Marty's kids are in deep trouble.  They travel again to 2015 (which, although seems a bit ""80's-ish"",it still is very well done, with flying cars and all.) to fix the mistakes.  After meeting an older Biff, the nemesis from the first film, Marty Purchases a Sports Aliminac, in a very clever scheme in winning money, but Doc throws in away,in order to save existance.  But when the the team gets back from 2015 to 1985, the 1985 Hill Valley that we know and love is a pit hole of filth, money, gangs and greed. It turns out that older Biff got his hands on the Alminac that Marty Puchased, took the DeLorean and went back in time to the younger Biff we knew and gave it to him to buy.  He became so rich and greedy from the money, that he turned 1985 upside down.  Now, Marty, Doc and Enstein (Doc's Dog) must go back to 1955 to take back the Alminac before the future is destroyed!BTTF2 is very well done for a sequel, espacilly the finale in which the gang goes back to 1955, in which most of the orginal scenes were re-shot to make a different angle for the film, since Marty sees himself many times in action getting his parents back (the object of the first film).  Many of the original cast returned, including Micheal J. Fox, Lea Tompson, Crispin Glover and Christopher Lloyd.  Not many people know that the girl who played Jennifer, Elizibeth Shue, wasn't the original girl from the first film, but make-up can fool many people.

562115,"'Under Suspicion' is one of those movies which is, to put it honestly, mediocre. It stars two fine actors (Morgan Freeman &amp; Gene Hackman), is quite innovatively directed (by Stephen Hopkins), and has an interesting setting (Puerto Rico during a carnival). The plot, on the other hand, comes across pretty standard.This is basically a police interrogation, familiar to many as it has been rendered time and again on television and in other movies. It is done well, by all involved, but it has also been done before. Hackman and Freeman, and the direction of Hopkins, lift the telling of the tale up a notch, but it still feels like old ground. There has been crime commited (in this case two murders), there is a prime suspect (Hackman), and so he and the overzealous policeman (Freeman) square off for a close-quarters interrogation.This sort of scenario, though well-worn, can make for a really good movie, so I sat back and soaked it all in. The film kept me riveted throughout, until the ending came along. Now, I am not here to give anything away - don't worry. But what I will say is that the picture suddenly went from its entire focus of a &quot;Did he do it?&quot; interrogation flick to &quot;Let's pause and reflect upon these characters, their lives, their hopes, their troubles, their fears, their desires, their angst&quot; - etc. etc.A movie which wants to end so poignantly must be sure to make the audience care about the characters. Maybe other viewers did. I did not, as I took this movie as a mystery/thriller. Most mystery/thrillers are simply plot-driven, and I saw no exception with 'Under Suspicion'. In a mystery/thriller, most of the actions taken by the characters are usually scrutinized for how they affect the *plot*, not the characters themselves.I don't know if I've expressed my thoughts on the matter very well - perhaps not. But my final word on the film is that it is enjoyable and engaging until the last 5-10 minutes. Just be prepared for what some may deem a possibly disappointing ending.",Under Suspicion
678520,"Dominic Toretto (Vin Diesel) rules the streets with his ""team"" in the world of illegal street races.  Running a luncheonette and a garage, Dominic makes money to pay for the mortgage on his house, and keep his sister (Jordana Brewster) in school, but that money alone is not enough so he resorts to the illegal ways to keep the cash flowing. Vowing to kill himself before returning to prison, Dominic stays one step ahead of the police until he meets Brian (Paul Walker), an undercover cop investigating a series of bizarre truck heists.The FBI believe Dominic and his crew are behind the robberies, and it's Brian's job to find enough evidence against, but putting together the case against this crew will prove to be difficult because Brian becomes friends with Dominic and starts to understand his difficult life, and at the same time he is falling in love with his sister.  To make matters worse, Dominics rival Johnny Tran drops in to settle some old scores, and the list of suspects in the robbery case is growing larger.`The Fast And The Furious' is top-notch entertainment.  Containing serious action sequences, and a thrilling mystery of the robberies, `The Fast And The Furious scores on many levels.  The action scenes are some of the best filmed racing sequences I have ever scene, and the pulsing soundtrack keeps things at a high energy level.The performances from Walker, and Diesel are right on the money, and the supporting cast of Brewster, Michelle Rodriguez, Chad Linberg, Johnny Strong and Ted Levine bring life to the characters they play.Great action, and a pulsing soundtrack will keep you glued to your seat for two hours of entertainment.",N/A

698417,"Before I urge you to rush out and revel in this romantic wisp of a movie, I must warn you that it is the kind of film that will make you either quake with bleary joy, or propel you out of the cinema with an ungovernable urge to smash things.  If the words 'sugar', 'naive' or 'cute' are not in your vocabulary; if the mere sight of a bobbed gamine making eyes at you across the screen doesn't make your heart flutter; if scenes where lamps discuss their owner's love life with her paintings, or a young girl screams to save her suicidal goldfish don't enchant you, than, in the words of Gilbert and Sullivan, don't go.If, however, you feel your spiritual home is in France, than 'Amelie' might just make you fall in love again.  it is for those who love Paris in sunshine or rain; who palpitate at the very thought of tree-lined Parisian streets and cafes; who have experienced haunting musical epiphanies at night in empty Metro stations; who have read Raymond Queneau novels; who rejoice in street markets, Renoir paintings, or the sight of horses running in the Tour de France.'Amelie' is a romantic comedy for those who prefer the chase to the clinch.  its heroine is almost a ghost, unloved and friendless as a child, who presides disembodied over strangers' lives, linking characters, punishing baddies and deciding destinies in ways that seem supernatural to them.  She can only observe others from a distance and act accordingly - her own life remains emotionally dead.  Of the various Queneau-like mysteries, red-herrings, non-sequiters and paper trails strewn throughout the film, the most pressing and emotionally charged is - will Amelie find love and rejoin the real world?The film is unashamedly nostalgic in its romantic vision of a vanished (never-was?) Paris, where musette is still played in sparse cafes, and funfairs and ghost trains become sites of erotic possibility.  The CGI effects are used not for inhuman spectacle, but to do rich justice to individuals' inner lives.  The idea of reworking the past; the comfort of myths, lies and delusions; the creation of one's own future - these are some of the film's themes, and they encompass characters, culture and place.  As such, the film has been condemned as reactionary.  It's probably sexist (although I identified with Amelie, rather than simply fancying her).It has reminded people of various reference points from the Oulipo writers to the early films of the French New Wave to Ally MacBeal.  its most recent counterpart might be 'Magnolia', from the opening narrtion with its comic chaos theory, and its narrative about disparate people trying to connect, to the godlike force that contrives to do so.  But it's much more treasurable than that.  i loved this film.  I loved the adorable Audrey Tautou, funny and smart, with huge melancholy eyes - a 21st century Audrey Hepburn.  I loved the way the film felt like a cinematic novel without being literary.  I loved the way the mystery plots took on emotional dimensions - the connection of clues to recover the past to restore happiness.  I loved the colours, especially those rich reds; the wistful accordian music; the love of vignettes, photographs, chance, fantasy, dreams...",Amelie
186860,"I first viewed this great work with Jose Fernandez, who was delivering a series of lectures here in Southern California, where he alleged that many film directors use archive footage of Popitekus for dermatophytic purposes. He highly recommended &quot;Pierrot le Fou&quot; as a key example of a director who strives to accomplish just the opposite. Jean Luc Godard presents a dithyrambic forage that successfully quenches any student's thirst for a portrait of jaspoid intrusion, brimful with jessant heraldry, yet not lacking in brilliant Manichean humor.Don't get me wrong; Jean Luc-Godard is no Ren&eacute; Cardonas. This bold attempt at cinematic brilliance merely mimics the magasame visions that Cardonas acheived from the late 1950s through 1965. While I must praise Godard for presenting a message in which the main protaganist strives for something greater than his mundane existence, certain portions of the film bear the propensity to contrive the real message. By throwing in the melodramatic suggestion of gangsters attempting to thwart the heroine's means, the thesis becomes overstated. I find it sad to think that perhaps Godard, deep inside, feels he lacks what great directors like Ren&eacute; Cardonas and Doris Wishman possess. This film is well worth purchasing until the films of the late Cardonas become available on DVD. In the meantime, &quot;Pierrot le Fou&quot; is worth your time.",N/A
679528,"Ok, let's try again since AOL booted me when I had my review finished and I lost it...I was pleasantly surprised that it was not the typical comedy/slasher movie of late, such as Scream (1,2,3), Last Summer, etc.  There was only one funny scene in Jeepers that I can recall and that was the name calling stint between the brother and sister.  I, and other movie goers, jumped out of my seat several times.  I had to move to the back of the theater with my back against the wall to avoid those irritating late attendees walking up behind me and startling me while watching the movie!  (And people, pleeeeease get a clue and leave your cell phones and crying babies at home!!!).  Even though there were scenes where you wanted to scream out ""get out of there dummies!"" to the brother and sister, there were still many scary scenes.  I agree with some reviewers that the psychic was just a waste of time, and would also like to know where the creeper came from, but it was a fun movie regardless; not in the true sense of the word ""fun,"" but fun as is getting to be scared.  I haven't been scared since the original Nightmare on Elm Street came out at theaters in 1984.  When I and other people came out of Jeepers (JC), several of us jumped when turning a corner in the theater hallway and there was a dark luminous shadow on the wall which happened to be just a shadow from the drinking fountain...Immediately after Jeepers, I went over to see Rock Star thinking it would get JC off my mind; talk about scary...go see Rock Star.  Anyway, while leaving the theater, I kept thinking I heard footsteps behind me and with the creeper on my mind, I ran to my car.  I can't wait to see it again and buy it on DVD!  I'm going to drag my husband (he's scared silly of horror movies) and my teen son to see it too.  Some reviewers are giving it reviews as if it was supposed to be some Shakespearean play, gees, lighten up, it's exactly what it's supposed to be; a ""B"" horror flick, but much better than the silly teen horrors out.",Jeepers Creepers
498681,"Some folks will try just about anything to get people to come to the movies.  &quot;A Knight's Tale&quot; is a case in point.  In this latest attempt to fill seats and make money, a Medieval setting featuring several jousting tournaments (including the world championship) is accented by a soundtrack that mixes an original Medieval-type score with, of all things, classic rock.  To some, that may seem like a fresh and exciting twist, but to me at least, it only serves to bury this already-laughable flick even deeper.  In my opinion, the movie itself wasn't even all that great; the plot is pretty much as simple as it gets (the whole story's in the trailers!), the dialogue was pretty much ripped from an episode of &quot;Xena&quot;, the action was bordering on just plain goofy (although I did actually flinch at several of the lance shots these guys were taking), and, of course, the soundtrack (don't even get me started).  Strangely, though, it seemed that every time this flick fell on its face, something would happen that almost redeemed it.  It was pretty much a rollercoaster for the emotions, actually; I groaned, I laughed, I flinched...all told, though, the groans were more frequent than anything else, and between that and looking at my watch at least twice during the movie, it makes a good summary for how it turned out.  Medieval &quot;purists&quot; will probably be insulted by this flick, but a few action fans might get a kick out of it.  Far as me, it was definitely not the best eight bucks I ever spent.  I might as well have stopped at the trailer.",A Knight's Tale
534793,"I love a movie that challenges me as a viewer and this movie definitely did that. The non-dialog, non-soundtrack portion of the film is original and different and challenging. I have decided I loved the uniqueness because they weren't there just to stretch but as storytelling techniques. I left my initial viewing not knowing for sure how I felt about it. During the film I was intensly interested in Tom Hanks and his performance as well as what his character's next step would be. So, when watching the DVD, seeing the film for the second time, I was just as involved in the tale. In addition to the excellent film this DVD included the kinds of things we are growing to not only love but expect from DVDs. The &quot;how it was done&quot; feature was great as was the vollyball feature and I just loved the Charlie Rose/Hanks interview. Anytime Hanks or Bob Zemmekes (spelling?) has something to say about the film I was facinated. I loved both discs in the two disc set and I know that from time to time I will pull out this gem and enjoy it all over again.",N/A

For once, a kind of historical theme based in the Middle Ages was picked up by the film industry and what is the result: a mixture of Mad Max, Alien and the 13th Warrior plus Techno-Music and technical equipment that did not quite fit into the time. I wonder how the producers put those things together!Anyhow, if you are looking for action-type movie without hoping to see mythical themes covered then you may enjoy it.

527795,"Now, I know what you're thinking. How can a sequel be better than the original? Well, it rarely happens that a sequel is better than the original, with THE KLUMPS it has. THE KLUMPS is a hilarious film, that will leave you laughing for a while after you see it. It picks up where the original left off, to expand on Sherman Klump's family. This time around, the plot is better, as is the quality of the film. Thus, I think it was better than the original.THE KLUMPS was not as groundbreaking as the first installment. However, it shows just how talented Eddie Murphy really is. Talented enough is he to play all the members of the Klump family (save the little boy) and a white exercise guru. Each character is wonderfully played and is unique. Also, as Sherman's love interest, we see the amazingly talented Janet Jackson. She is incredibly beautiful and adds real sparkle to the film. Her chemistry with Sherman is extremely believable, making the romance part of the film great.In essence, THE KLUMPS is a great film with a great plot and cast. If you love very very funny comedies, with great plots and a sparkle of romance, then THE KLUMPS is a film you should have. You won't be disappointed. Enter the very funny Klump family today!",N/A

454046,"&quot;Henry: Portrait of a Serial Killer&quot; is based on the life of Henry Lee Lucas, who got his jollies by committing gratuitous acts of murder in a variety of forms. It's a brutal piece of filmmaking, an in-your-face horror film that possesses little story but really does not need one. This is not a movie about solving a mystery or finding a killer's identity; it's about murder, and little else.What makes a film such as this scary is the fact that Henry is not a killer in a hockey mask, or someone who comes back only on a certain night each year to claim a victim here or there. He kills as he pleases, something he does to relieve his tensions and stresses. No money? Go kill a man and take his Visa card. It's this kind of blunt attitude that permeates the entire picture.He lives with his friend Otis, whose sister has come to live with them until she gets on her feet. As Otis's sister becomes strangely drawn to Henry, Otis also begins to uncover the sensation one gets when killing someone, and begins going on drives with Henry to exercise that sensation.There's little else to discuss in terms of plot; the movie is not concerned with developing the story. Director John McNaughton throws out any and all horror clich&eacute;s and creates a film that is strikingly original yet extremely controversial. Some have hailed it as a masterpiece, while others have slammed it for its excessive use of violence and brutality.I find the film to be very interesting. Watching Henry driving his car, walking the street at night, makes me think just how many people with similar skeletons in the closet do those same things each day. It makes you think about just what kind of people could be living right next door to you, or standing behind you in the grocery store. It's very chilling and unique.But I'll never watch it again. For all its brilliance, &quot;Henry&quot; is too disturbing, too gruesome, too realistic in its acts for me to stomach another viewing. These scenes do have a purpose, yes, but once seen, they are hard to strike from the mind. A scene involving the murder of a family is haunting and almost unbearable, while the climax involving Henry and Otis is excessively violent.So what is my final consensus on the film? A positive one. &quot;Henry&quot; is about a simple man who commits complex crimes, someone who is no different in his appearance than anyone we know in real life. The horror is more shocking than it is frightening, and while the substance is minute, the brutality is not. &quot;Henry&quot; will be remembered by all who see, even those who choose not to recall its events.",N/A

558950,"Many others have already summarized the plot of this movie, so I won't bore you with those details.All I'll say is that Frequency contained a few surprises, a lot of heart and solid acting by Dennis Quaid and others. I enjoyed it tremendously -- so much so that I bought the DVD and have watched it three or four times already.Even though the main focus is the relationship between father and son (separated by 30 years since the death of the father), this movie of the heart doesn't shirk on matters of the head. More scientific in its foundation than Field of Dreams (which simply featured a magic cornfield that enabled the living to interact with the dead), Frequency still manages to make the viewer wonder and wish -- and yearn for second chances with lost loved ones.If you like your movies to be intelligent, well-acted and able to employ both your heart and your mind, you could do a lot worse than Frequency. I highly recommend it.If you don't want to take the plunge and outright buy it before you see it, rent it first. However, I think you'll enjoy it enough to want to own it.

557407,"This 2 DVD set is any true fan's dream come true.  I've loved the Beastie Boys since I was a kid listening to to &quot;Licence to Ill&quot; on my boombox.  While I've grown out of many of the things I liked as a kid, the Beasties have grown with me.I love their music.  The Beasties have proven thmselves capable of growth and versatility while keeping everything in perspective. Whenever I'm with a group who can't agree on music, they can almost always settle for Beasties, whether they ONLY like the punk tracks or ONLY like the rap tracks or like me, love all of it.  I'm going to go out on a limb and just say it: BEASTIES RULE!!! If you don't love their music, this set is not for you, you can stop reading this and go try and find the new 'N Sync or Michael Bolton CD or whatever it is you listen to.Ok, I always like to get my complaints out of the way early, believe me, they'll be brief.  1. Censorship.  It's not that I can't live without the 'f' or 's' words, but it drives me crazy when they are edited from original material, be it movies, or in this case songs.  While Beastie tracks have never been drenched with profanity, they do sprinkle some curse words here and there.  They are noticeably absent from this set for whatever reason.  It's nothing to get riled up about, not even worth a star from my review, but it's a big pet peeve of mine and worth mentioning.  I've returned CD's for the same offense.2.  Also absent are all those &quot;Licence to Ill&quot; video's.  This is probably do to some copyright wars or something.  Russell Simmons maybe?  What strikes me as strange is that, while the songs appear on the &quot;Anthology&quot; CD set, their corresponding videos do not appear on the DVD's.  Not a big loss.  REALLY old punk video's like &quot;Holy Snappers&quot; do however.  Again, it's a small complaint.Everything else about the set is absolutely fantastic.  Each video contains a wealth of information.  One of my personal favorites is the inclusion of almost all 'B' side remixes.  I used to own the single for &quot;What'Cha Want&quot; which had a ton of remixes.  When I lost it, I was never able to replace it.  I was very pleased to find almost all of the remixes on this DVD all sychronized to the video.  Good stuff.Using &quot;What'Cha Want&quot; as an example of quality, it also contains several alternate angles from the original filming: Beasties in the studio, talking head Beasties, etc. which can be mixed and matched with the different remixes.  While most of them are just good for a quick laugh, it adds variety to something that used to be very static.There are actually two formats when you want to watch and listen.  The first basic way of watching is by viewing them in sequence, this is the only way to select the 5.1 sound and the commentaries, but you can't select alternate tracks.  The DVD will play from beginning to end without prompting. The other way of playing is as I described with &quot;So What'Ca Want&quot;.  You select an individual song and then set it up how you like, or view bonus material for that particular track (&quot;Body Movin' and &quot;Sabotage&quot; have some cool/funny extras).  You can also switch mixes and angles in mid-play by using the on-screen menu.  I thought this feature was one of the coolest and most practical.Almost all the songs have alternate tracks and angles, and all of them have Directors commentary and commentary from the Beasties themselves.  While you might not get a huge amount of technical advice if you're a budding director, the commentaries are entertaining and give a glimpse into the Beastie world.Also, not surprisingly, the disc contains links to the Beaties web site and their various &quot;Free Tibet&quot; sites and charity organizations which are all non-profit and rely on donations.  Incedentally, anyone who's owned the &quot;Tibetan Freedom Concert&quot; 3 CD set might find it as another good example of how well the Beasties throw together a compilation.  It too contained a wealth of great information, movies and interactive material similar to the stuff on this set.From a fans standpoint, this is a great set because of all the cool Beastie stuff, from a technical standpoint it sets a new standard for interactive DVD viewing and shows just how versatile the format can be.  Artists should be going out of their way to emulate what the Beasties have done here with a little bit of foresight, planning and a total respect for their fans.  The sad thing is, most artists are either too lazy, too self-involved, or too god-awful to provide a quality product for their fans and customers.  This is why the Beasties are far ahead of the pack.",BEASTIE BOYS DVD VIDEO ANTHOLOGY
293391,"PERSONA is everything a film should be - visually groundbreaking, thematically complex, and a deeply involving emotional experience.  The plot is almost laughably simple: A famous stage actress, Elisabeth Vogler (Liv Ullmann) appears to have a nervous breakdown.  Unwilling to speak or even interact with others, she is sent to recuperate at the seaside home of her doctor in the care of a young nurse, Sister Alma (Bibi Andersson).  Over time, the talkative Alma becomes more and more obsessed with her famous patient, and resorts to emotional blackmail and even violence in her attempts to force Elisabeth to communicate with her.  Ultimately, the two women's identities seem to blur into one.  Driven nearly insane by her relationship with Elisabeth, Alma leaves her service.  It is impossible to overstate how complicated a viewing experience PERSONA is for the uninitiated spectator.  Both of the lead actresses are phenomenal.  Liv Ullmann delivers one of the most nuanced and complex cinematic performances in existence, despite having no more than one line of dialogue (or possibly two).  Bibi Andersson's interpretation of Alma is equally stunning - cool, calm and professional at first, then slowly descending into a whirlpool of self-doubt and then madness.  Characteristic of this film is its ambiguity - the viewer is forced think for themselves about the meaning of events and individual sequences, rather than being spoon-fed a series of definitive images, as in Hollywood movies.  Is Elisabeth actually ill, or is she merely selfish, acting yet another role to manipulate those around her?  Is Alma's mental breakdown the result of Elisabeth's treatment of her, or does she bring it on herself by using Elisabeth as a blank screen on which she projects her own fantasies?  The emotional and intellectual themes of the film - what is identity and how do other people play a role in our construction of our own personalities? - are perfectly balanced by an extraordinary cinematic style which foregrounds the illusory nature of the &quot;actions&quot; taking place in front of us.  Beginning with its opening montage, PERSONA explicitly reminds the viewer of its status as a fiction, and of the material process which transforms a set of still pictures into shadows with the illusion of life.  Within the body of the main narrative, certain sequences (such as Elisabeth's midnight visit to Alma's room) are structured so that we are unsure whether what we are watching is &quot;real&quot; or merely an hallucination on Alma's part - indeed, the entire last half of the film may be no more than Sister Alma's fantasies, but then again...PERSONA'S mystery and meaning are best expressed in an astonishing shot within the opening montage - a boy interrupts his reading and reaches towards the camera/audience.  A cut reverses the perspective, and we see the boy extending his arm to caress what seems to be a huge screen, on which colossal images of Andersson and Ullmann's faces appear, merge with one another, and disappear.  In this single sequence, Bergman amalgamates Woman and the Screen of the cinema, and the child seeking the embrace of the mother with the cinema audience.  PERSONA is one of the most unusual, even philosophical films ever made and it will certainly haunt your dreams as it haunts mine.",Persona VHS
253699,"Ben Hecht and Charles MacArthur seemed to have had a great time tossing off this adventure film about Kipling's water-boy, Gunga Din.  With vaguely fond memories of Soldiers Three and Thugee and even My Lord the Elephant, they let themselves go and concocted a lively and two-thirds exciting action piece of celebrating, not too solemnly, some of Britains (of yore) with the natives of India  Following thier own errant fancies, they have skipped lightly from melodrama to slapstick to sentiment to genuine thrills mingled with theatrical heroics, sticking to only one discernably resolute aim, to break conspicuously away form the conventional boy-and-girl theme: the girl (Joan Fontaine) is quite brutally abandoned by her fiance for the presumbably greater pleasure of life in Her of His Majesty's Service.  George Stevens took this dazzling, irresponsible script and directed it for all it was worth and did a great job.  Everybody concerned with putting GUNGA DIN on the screen did his technical best (including a remarkably good composer of the musical score), and to excellent effect. The bhisti, Gunga Din, appears only intermittently for all his title role, but he (the excellent and unique Sam Jaffe) has the final big moment.  Eduardo Cianelli is excellent in a great example as the man you love to hate with Grant, McLaglen and Fairbanks doing commendable work in thier roles.  If as a whole it can't be taken very seriously, it's because its author seemed to have been indulging in a little swing session on Kipling themes, improvising with more gusto than intention, with really nothing to say.",N/A

40898,"First, let me compliment the cast.  The two female leads, I believe, did an absolutely fabulous job with their roles, and convinced me that they could have actually have fallen in love.  That is very important, because everything else that happens in the film is dependent on believing that they have developed enough love and trust in each other to pull off the caper they are attempting.  Joe Pantoliano also does a good job as the mobster trying to pull himself out of the hole he finds himself in when the movie really kicks into gear.Okay, to get to the plot.  Basically, Jennifer Tilly's character(Violet) sees and then meets Gina Gershon's character(Corky), they develop a relationship, fall in love, and then decide to steal over two million dollars from the mob and blame it on Violet's boyfriend.  That's only the nut shell though, the actual story takes many twists and turns over this material as things start spinning wildly out of control, and things don't always go the way that the girls had planned.A lot of the story depends on split timing from the girls, and the belief that they could trust one another enough to pull this off after knowing each other for such a short time, and the fact that they could have fallen in love with one another.  Their relationship does seem to develop fairly fast, but from the first time the two of them really talked to one another over a cup of coffee, to the scene where Violet entices Corky over by asking her to get an earring she dropped down the drain out for her, I was sold.  Just listening to Violet breathlessly asking Corky to kiss her as they sat on the couch after the earring episode was an experience in itself.After that, when the money enters the picture, their relationship is primarily put on the back burner as everything now hinges around the money.  The money is stolen, rather cleverly, but from there things start going downhill for the two of them.  Ceasar, Pantoliano's character, doesn't react the way Corky thought he would, and soon the bodies begin to pile up, and after a little trick with a redial button, the girls find themselves in real danger, where they really need their trust in one another to save their lives.The pace of the movie always remains brisk, and I found myself constantly sitting on the edge of my seat as I watching it, all the way through until the end.  I don't want to spoil the ending for anyone, so don't read the end of this if you haven't already seen the movie.  I like the movies where the bad guy gets his, and although almost everyone in this movie was a bad guy in one way or another, even the two female leads, I still enjoyed seeing Violet blow Ceasar away, and the two girls riding off into the metaphoric sunset with the two million dollars.  A most enjoyable way to spend two hours of your time, at least in my book.  Hope you think so too.",N/A

The &quot;scene&quot; dynamic once again taking something relatively innocent, and putting price tags and labels on it. But this movie is a true classic, and some how captures that era so well. A time when stage diving, being in the pit, and wearing anything and everything to offend others wasn't the status quo. But, all good things must come to an end.

To tell you the truth I enjoy the films that they pumped out in the 80's (others include Missing in Action, Death Wish 3, Enter the Ninja, ect.). Their films all include bad acting but are full of great action. I love 'em, well most of 'em, in a duranged sort of way. I enjoyed American Ninja thouroughly because it is exactly what I expected. I would not recommend this film though, only to fans of B-Action movies. Dudikoff can't act, but he knows his martial arts, and that is what this film relies on.

397068,"Strange low-budget Abel Ferrera film is much too pretentious, arty and slow moving to enjoy as horror film, but at times is a fascinating film which melds drug addiction and vampirism. It's not always sure what it wants to say or where it's going and in the end seems pointless (though there's a muddled message about spirituality in here).It combines some ruminations on the philosophy of Kirkegarrd, Nietzsche, Sartre and shows us a woman struggling against personal convictions, desires and addictions.  When attempts are made to link all of this to things like the Holocaust, and the My Lai massacre it lost me, but it's an ambitious and at times interesting film shot in black and white.  It is slow going though.  Don't be fooled by the cast which includes Christopher Walken(a cameo), Lili Taylor and Annabella Sciorra and the presence of Ferrera into thinking there's some camp value in the film-it's a low budget serious arty film with very little humor.Chris Jarmick, Author of The Glass Cocoon with Serena F.

341132,"This film production of Bizet's Carmen, shot on location in southern Spain, is magnificent. The singing and acting are first rate, as are the sound and picture quality of the DVD. Carmen, like Don Giovanni, is a complex, multi-faceted character that can be played a variety of ways. Julia Migenes portrays Carmen with raw sensuality, and it works, as we see her opposite, Don Jose (performed brilliantly by Placido Domingo), unable to escape her womanly powers. The film uses dialogue rather than recitatives, as that is what Bizet intended--Carmen is an opera comique, which means that spoken dialogue (not recitatives) are employed between the singing. The dialogue definitely heightens the drama of Carmen, and it was only after Bizet's death that sung recitatives were unfortunately used in in this opera. Because this is a film version of Carmen, there are many creative and symbolic options that couldn't be done in the opera house. The use of a live bull in the ring is extemely effective, and it is the first image we see in this film. We see how beautiful and noble the bull is, how strong and free spirited he is. This powerful and tragic image will stay with us throughout the film. The use of such symbolism allows us ultimately to compare Carmen to the brave bull who would rather die than surrender its freedom, while don Jose is the bullfighter who must kill the object he lives for and loves most. There is real frisson between Domingo and Migenes as they heat up the screen--Domingo gives an amazing performance of don Jose's gradual fall and ultimate self-destruction. There are no disappointments in the entire cast. The final act is most effective as don Jose essentially is transformed into the matador while Carmen represents the courageous bull--refusing to back down, she must die, just as the bull must be sacrificed in the ring. While they are performing their &quot;dance of death&quot; we are shown clips of Carmen's new lover, a matador, in the ring facing a real bull--this is a powerful juxtaposition that could obviously only be done on film. This is a striking film, one that captures the very essence of Carmen and her world, and it only gets better with repeated viewings.",N/A

522982,"What can I say, this is the best movie I have ever seen, when I saw the trailer on t.v I knew it was going to be a box-office hit at least, but when I saw the movie, just for the first scene, the Battle, I knew this was the best movie of the year and the best movie yet. I saw it on the premiere and not many people believed my comments, but afterwards most of my relatives and friends agreed with me, this is a G R E A T movie, for years we had been expecting, or at least I had been expecting a great movie, and after the Titanic disappointment, I though it would never come, but oh boy Ridley Scott did a terrific job in accomplishing this, making a both emotional and exiting and visually alluring film, then he went on an made another amazing movie, Hannibal, not as great, but sure a great movie to spend 2 hours and 20 minutes of your time watching Anthony Hopkins do what he does best, be Hannibal ""the cannibal"" Lecter. But lets talk Gladiator, Russell Crowe is great, no wander he won the Oscar for his performance, I would have lost all my respect to the award if he didn't. Joaquin Phoenix should and I still complain about it, won the Oscar, sure, Benicio was good, but if you see Phoenix and compare it to Benicio you will see my point, the role of Commodus was much more emotional, had more screen time, the character for me was better and I think played greatly. The rest of the cast is also wonderful, specially the late Oliver Reed, too bad we lost this great actor, he may had won the Oscar for this performance. And the soundtrack is another proof that Hans Zimmer is a genius. To sum up, buy Gladiator, is a great movie, and a great DVD, it has great sound, picture, and special features, a must have. 5 stars are not enough.",Gladiator VHS

Script was shoddily written and character development turned out to be very weak, not to mention a complete lack of credibility/chemistry between Wynter & Perez in their portrayal of Alma Mahler's & Oscar Kokoschka's tumultuous whirlwind affair.You'd be better off spending your money on books on the Austrian art scene instead.

285238,"Who among the producers of this curdled melodrama could have believed it would make money, especially during the conformist year 1957. It didn't. But it did score with critics, and has since achieved status as a minor masterpiece. Never has the tawdry world of New York show business been so savagely portrayed as in the characters of Sidney Falco (Tony Curtis) and J. J. Hunseker (Burt Lancaster), schemers with &quot;the scruples of a guinea hen and the morals of a gangster&quot;. The machinations fly fast and furious as viewers reach for a score card to keep up. Still it's fascinating stuff. Tony Curtis gets the role he was born to play, a charmingly unscrupulous press agent, and a gutsy departure for this inane matinee idol. The dialogue is first rate with many memorable lines, as the characters bounce off one another like competitors in a demolition derby. Photography is aptly noirish with emphasis on lounge lizard locations. There's a distinct feel to this movie setting it apart from other depictions of New York decadence, a style and mood that linger: the leering cop, the offended wife, the crawling street scenes. Somehow a bunch of Hollywood types got together with a British director, a Chinese-American cameraman, and a couple of New York writers to craft this timeless foray into mid-century America. Don't miss it, especially if you like your lemonade on the sour side.",N/A
131973,"I am a VERY big fan of dark movies - and an even BIGGER one of gorgeous cinematography.  Which is why I liked this movie.  Matt Damon is truly incredible.  Other reviewers have stated they cannot understand why he lies throughout the movie, seemingly, &quot;for no reason.&quot;  I COMPLETELY understand his character.  I, too, lied to people &quot;for no reason&quot; - but in reality, I had a reason - I lied to get others to accept me and like me.  I feared that if they knew the truth, they would shun me.  That extreme fear of rejection caused many problems for me.  You find yourself telling bigger and more fantastic lies to cover the smaller ones.  You also find yourself lying when you don't really have the need to - because it's become so commonplace.  Tom Ripley needs to lie for these reasons and for another - he's killed a man he loves.  What happens after that is intriguing.  Gwyneth Paltrow isn't very good in this movie, but Jude Law - playing the quintessential rich jerk, Dickie (true to his name, I guess) - was great.  The ending, like &quot;American Beauty,&quot; is very shocking and extremely sad.  I intend to read the book very soon.",N/A

He has Returned to the kind of Humour his fans love him for.Adam plays One of Three Sons of Satan, (hilariously played by the ever-versatile Harvey Kietel) who has to come up to earth in search of his brothers.The Cast is to Die for. Harvey Kietel and Rhys Ifrans lead the Charge with two Deliciously Evil performances. They are both such talented actors, they can do the Silliest things, and still looks so Dignified. Rodney Dangerfield fills his screen time with Stand Up routines, and Patricia Arquette is likeable as Adams Love interest.""Little Nicky"" is also filled with Wonderful Cameos. (lots of these actors have worked with Adam before) Jon Lovitz and Reese Witherspoon make the most of their cameos, while Dana Carvey and John Witherspoon waste their cameos and waste our time. They simply aren't funny here. Many people have teased Quinten Tarantino's cameo as the Blind Priest.. Sure, he wasn't the Funniest guy in the film, but he had me laughing.Now to the man himself, Adam Sandler. His Nicky creation is a very Funny one, I'd rank him as my Second favourite of Sandlers film Characters. (""Happy Gilmore"" will probably Never be Beaten)The film is flawed. John Witherspoon's and Dana Carvey's Cameos DO hurt the film, they had the whole theatre dead quiet when I saw it, you could have heard a Pin drop. Also, Adam once again proves himself Far too Loyal to his friends, as he gives them roles in this film, like he has in all of his films, even though they are not very Talented actors or comedians. Fans of Adam's films will know whom I'm talking about.But, those Minor Quibbles aside, it's a Very Fun film, Over and Over again. It's Definitely a must for his fans",N/A

549847,"I've never been a big fan of Woody Allen's more mainstream movies, but I really liked this film.  Allen draws upon his knowledge of jazz to bring the life of fictional jazz guitarist Emmett Ray (the second greatest jazz guitarist in the world), and a completely irresponsible and idiosynchratic person.  Who else would take his dates to the dump to shoot rats?  Despite his considerable talent, Emmett lives in fear of his idol, the great Django Rheinhardt.  For those of you unfamiliar with jazz, Rheinhardt really existed and during his lifetime was one of the finest guitar players the world has ever known.Sean Penn, an actor who is sadly better known for his brief marriage to Madonna than for his considerable acting skills, turns in an Oscar-worthy performance as Emmett, playing him as a lovable but quirky and ultimately vulnerable character (Penn received an Oscar nomination for this portrayal, incidentally).  Uma Thurman appears briefly as Ray's socialite wife who marries him more out of curiosity than love.  Samantha Morton practically steals the movie away from Penn as the deaf-mute girlfriend who unconditionally loves him despite Emmett's inherent self-centeredness and lack of trustworthiness.  The director appears briefly explaining the life and times of Emmett in documentary style.  Although I didn't particularly care for this way of presenting the picture, it was at most a minor distraction.Whether you're a jazz afficianado or just appreciate an interesting character study, this motion picture is worth a look.",N/A

303307,"While I do not agree with some of The French Connection's Oscar wins (A Clockwork Orange was the Best Picture of 1971), I still believe that this is one of the best action movies ever made. Gene Hackman deservedly won an Academy Award for his performance as Jimmy ""Popeye"" Doyle, who along with his partner ""Cloudy"" Russo (Roy Scheider) attempt to bring down a narcotics ring. The Elevated train-car chase has gone down in cinema history as possibly the best car chase ever filmed. One of the things that make this film so great is its gritty realism. All the sets used are actual interiors and there was hardly any lighting. Director William Friedkin (Who won an Oscar) had a background in documentary. His technique gives a realistic feel to the movie, as if we are there.Recently, when my family decided to purchase a DVD player, the first DVD I got for it was the recently released ""Five-Star Collection"" Two Disc set of this movie. The picture quality is excellent. Not a single scratch and no `jittery' frames. There are some scenes that are grainy, especially the opening shots in Marseilles. But this is probably because it was filmed this way.The second disc is loaded with features. There are seven deleted scenes, which can come with or without William Freidkin's commentary. Most of these scenes are character development scenes. But while fascinating to watch them, after you see them you'll understand why they were cut out. There are also two documentaries: BBC's ""Poughkeepsie Shuffle"" and a special 30th anniversary documentary that covers the French Connection case, Robin Chases's book and the movie's making.Overall, this is an excellent DVD that is well worth investing in.",The French Connection VHS

As far as I know, she's not a certified aerobics instructor, but she had Karen Voight serve as Fitness Consultant for this video, and that was good enough for me. She's taught dance routines for years.  Much of what she did for George Michael, Janet Jackson, and the guys from ZZTop probably involved getting them to relax and not worry over how goofy they felt when they couldn't get the steps the first time around.  She does spend some time talking about that before you begin this routine.  In the words of the customer service experts, she practiced good expectations management there.  So I wasn't surprised or disappointed that I couldn't get it all the first time, either.  Heck, I like a challenge!You can't do this if you're sleepy.  I've never tried it at 5:00am.  To me, it's more of a &quot;let's dance and have a party&quot; routine, and one I want to be fully awake for. And there are no modifications given for those who want or need a gentler routine. But this is an intermediate program, after all. I've found that if I didin't snap my neck all the way around, bend my knees too deeply, or jump--just raise my arms toward the ceiling and go up on my toes--then I was all right. I'd also encourage folks who want to keep their heart rate up to use a full range of motion dring the &quot;teaching&quot; segments of the routine and really lift their knees up during the &quot;march-it-outs.&quot; I found that even the &quot;YMCA cooldown&quot; (which is really goofy but fun, anyway!) can be aerobic if I made my moves bigger. If this sounds like too much work, then pick up a Kathy Smith or Donna Richardson video, practice the low-impact modifiers they teach, and come back to Paula's program later!Having given those caveats, I still think this is a great, fun, inspiring workout. Paula is beautiful and she's passionate about dancing.  This tape is her way of making some of that accessible to the masses. You've gotta love her for that! One exerciser is 42, another is 50--so it's not all 20-somethings. I knew going in that it would take consistent practice to master the dance steps. After a month, I had most of them learned, and abandoned my &quot;modifications&quot; to really go for it. I'm also glad to see an aerobics tape which includes abdominal floor work after the cooldown. If I do ab stuff even a little bit following an all-out cardio routine, my back usually benefits from the stretching and muscle work, too.  The most important things are to not get discouraged if you can't get all the steps down in a week or two, and as Paula says, &quot;don't give up&quot; and &quot;have a great time!&quot;  I didn't and I did.

533719,"I have been waiting for someone to release a movie like Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon for maybe ten years.  I had hoped it would be an American film but I think it fitting it was something in the middle. Ang Lee has been directed the outstanding film Sense and Sensibilities which is amazing considering it is a perfectly British feeling 19th century English country romance-comedy-drama. In spite of this success continues to make Chinese language films like &quot;Eat Drink Man Woman&quot; that have had a small but enthusiastic following here.  For me Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon was nothing new. Even though I am a pasty white boy, I have had the privilege of enjoying Chinese fantasy adventure films before.  Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon has finally introduced America to a genre of film that has been long enjoyed in China. And in particular I believe to a great extent the film is an homage to the artistry of the great Chinese director Tsui Hark (pronounced Choy Hock)who has been orchestrating elaborate choreography such as this in forests, cities and buildings for years. Crouching Tiger is a blend of Sense and Sensibility and the films of Tsui Hark and others directors in that tradition.  It is therefore no accident that suddenly but quietly appearing on the DVD shelves of all your Blockbuster Video stores are the best known films of Tsui Hark.  Once Upon a Time in China and the Swordsman series.  Unlike most American films the sequels, Once Upon a Time in China 2 and Swordsman 2 are considered the best films. If you enjoyed Crouching Tiger,Hidden Dragon you will also thrill to Swordsman 2 just as much.  The choreography is often even more spectacular than what you have seen. Squadrons of ninjas whorl and fly through the forests displaying powers you have not even imagined. And like Crouching Tiger, men and women (and men-women in some cases) are on an equal footing. I have heard it said that once you have seen Alien or Aliens and jumped out of your seat, the only way to recapture that experience is to see the film with a friend who hasn't seen the film yet and watch them jump out of their skin.  For me it was kind of wonderful listening to the audience applaud after watching the rooftop chase.  Obviously it was the first time my audience had ever seen anything like that. So while it was not as amazing to me having seen similar it was very cool knowing this was an eye opener for many uninitiated.  I hope some people will be inspired to take a chance and watch the films that inspired Crouching Tiger.  Hopefully it will usher in inovative styles of action films in the U.S..  It already has if you have seen &quot;The Matrix.&quot;","Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon VHS"

The series ends on a high note, with the Autobots reclaiming Cybertron to it's golden age and many new characters being introduced. But come to think of it, you're most likely a Transformer fan and know that already. You know you want this (even if only for the sake that it's the final episodes). As for this DVD, the menu screen is a bit bland and there are no extras, but there is one thing to crow about.  The episode previews and recaps are included with the 3 episodes! This way you see the shows as they originally aired. I enjoyed this so much as I figured they'd drop them since all three parts are shown back to back. Also each episode is broken into 6 chapters for easy access to your favorite scens within them. The only thing I miss are the intro and outros to commercials, but it probably would've been weird to include them when there are no commercials. Now before rushing off to buy this DVD, remember that Rhino is planning on releasing the entire first season of Transformers in a box set early next year. If it sells well (I'm sure it will), the other seasons will most likely follow. Can you wait for the final series box set to be released? Didn't think so. So pick up this 'Heroes' DVD and enjoy.

The movie starts by a series of sketches designed to show life as a teenager growing up.  The beach, the party, the quick trip to Tijuana, the girlfriend, and the older surfer mentor.  All of them very cliched like they were almost copied.  The dialog by all characters is so poor it's virtually impossible to feel emotion for the characters.  A few weak attempts at comedy are more lowlifes.The movie then moves in time to show the kids growing up.  The trip to the Draft Board and attempts to be deferred are almost incoherent.  But the most humorous part of this movie is Jan Michael Vincent's occasional flashes as a drunken street person.  Look quickly because he recovers by the next scene and is normal again.  Maybe it's a disease because next the elder surfer (resembles Greg Noll, da Bull) catches the drunken role disease.As to being a surf cult film, yes there are some early surf scenes, and the ending has a solid 10 minutes of surfing as the kids are drawn to the beach 13 years later when the surf is up.  But it's not enough to sit through 2 hours of bad movie to watch some surfing.I'm surprised this movie is rated so high by so many.  If you want a movie of growing up, rewatch American Graffiti or even Saturday Night Fever.  But not this movie.  The one large positive of this movie is watching some future stars or at least working actors and see what they were like at the start of their careers.",Big Wednesday VHS

184494,"This film, alternately boring and compelling, is a work of pure symbolic imagery. I do not know what I would have interpreted  it to mean had I not read the sleeve of the video. Unlike my favorite film of all time, Eraserhead (a film with which it will inevitably be compared), Begotten made no attempt to connect the abstract, yet gorgeous, images to a reality with which I can identify. While Lynch's work takes an average man (average, at least, in the world in which it is set) and adds surreal elements to his slow crawl toward insanity, Begotten is practically &quot;DaDa-ist&quot; in its unrepenting lack of human connection. I gave this tepid piece of pretention three stars, and would own it, simply for the imagery. It is some of the most beautiful I have ever seen.",N/A
534662,"This movie is to Tom Hanks what the Cable Guy was to Jim Carrey. In Cable Guy everyone expected another Ace Ventura and instead got a wonderful black comedy. Unfortunately in most people's minds Carrey wasn't supposed to do black comedy and this truly remarkable performance was ignored and the movie floundered.In Cast Away Tom Hanks leaves his gosh-golly everyman and becomes an time obsessed FedEx manager named Chuck Noland. Through circumstances he becomes stranded on an island in the South Pacific. For almost an hour we share the island with Chuck and a ball named Wilson. While it might sound odd it is really very captivating and entertaining.In a stock movie the Hanks character would have been found and lived happily ever after, however in Cast Away the ending is intelligent and much more interesting.The DVD extras are on a separate disk and are complete from trailers through interviews to featurettes. The interview with Charlie Rose is curious but gives you an idea of the time and effort it takes for even Tom Hanks to develop a project and get it filmed. It is curious because throughout the interview Rose appears unprepared, careless, and inept which makes it almost painful yet peculiarly intriguing to watch.People will say of Cast Away that it wasn't Hanks at his best or that the story was flawed. Personally, I think that Hanks was brilliant and the storyline was original and refreshing. To dismiss this film is to dismiss both a well crafted and entertaining movie and a superlative performace by Tom Hanks.",N/A
61149,"TV will rot your brain, some say- and in the world of Videodrome, that's exactly what happens. A group working with a media philosopher (a nice parody of Marshall McCluhan) has created a signal that can be superimposed on a video program that will, quite literally, mutate the brain. It may be a tumor- or it may be a new organ. It's infected cable TV president Max Venn (James Woods), and  is starting to change him and his world in bizarre ways.Videodrome is a wonderfully original movie that mixes a well crafted script with some novel (for the time) special effects and a marvelous darkly comic sensibility. Puns abound; the president of &quot;Spectacular Optics&quot;- itself a pun- is named Convex. Brian Oblivion (the Marshall McCluhan parody) founded the &quot;Cathode Ray Mission&quot; (as in &quot;cathode ray emission&quot;), where the homeless and destitute are re-integrated into society by providing them with exposure to television.Underneath this is a dark, sexual theme- Max's attraction to the images of bondage and sadism that are his undoing, and to radio psychologist Nikki (Debbie Harry, in a compelling if inartful performance) who is willing to go a lot farther than is Max in her pursuit of kinky thrills.Is Max really being physically transformed, or is it all in his head? Is the New Flesh real, or another delusion? All in all, a compelling and original film that will delight any fan of cult films and erotic horror.",N/A
580383,"What an absolutely lovely film this was. And what a shame it never enjoyed wider release, for it is eminently worth viewing. I was even more delighted when I found out that it really was based on a true story...the director/writer is Buddy's nephew.Buddy Visalo is a lovable, warm, and bumbling dreamer whose wife Estelle constantly deflates his trial balloons--because she is expected to by her culture and the times they lived in. She wants Buddy to take no chances and would rather he kept a job he hated than try something new and more daring.To realize his dream, Buddy must ignore Estelle and also evict  the pregnant Mary O'Neary from the upstairs of the place where he hopes to start his bar. This eviction pains him greatly. How he assuages his pain and helps her out is the heart and soul of &quot;Two-Family House&quot;.This is a movie about doing good for someone and expecting nothing in return, about trying to fulfill a dream and dealing with the obstacles that are in your way. It is not a complex movie with a hidden agenda and messages tangled up in a lot of gimmickry. There are serious themes treated seriously, but never in a preachy way. It is just uplifting and full of truths with a hero who is Everyman. As one reviewer said ....&quot;Buddy is off on an adventure that surprises even him.

539378,"""Shrek"" is the ultimate fractured fairy tale, a film that manages to simultaneously honor and lampoon the conventions of its genre without becoming smug or condescending in the process.  For while it is sardonic, ""Shrek"" is never cynical, so confident and assured are its makers in establishing and maintaining just the right tone for a revisionist exercise such as this one.  The film certainly conveys a modern sensibility, yet it is a gentle sort of iconoclasm that allows us to enjoy the more conventional aspects of the story (the happily-ever-after ending, for example) even as we are laughing at the obvious absurdities contained within them.The revisionism begins with Shrek himself, as unromantic a figure as has ever earned the title of ""hero"" in a fairy tale adventure.  For Shrek is an ogre, plain and simple, an ugly, cranky, decidedly standoffish beast who wants nothing more than to rid his swamp of all the classic fairy tale figures (Pinocchio, the Three Little Pigs, The Three Bears, The Three Blind Mice et al), who have been consigned there by the dastardly Lord Farquaad, who is attempting to purge his land of all those bothersome folkloric personalities.  To earn the deed to his land and thereby have authority to evict the squatters, Shrek agrees to go in search of the beautiful Princess Fiona, rescue her from her dragon-guarded castle, and bring her back for Lord Farquaad to marry (thereby earning the latter the legitimate title of Prince of the Land).  Of course, every valiant hero needs his own wisecracking sidekick to accompany him on his journey and Shrek finds his in Donkey, a companion whose sardonic humor serves as both a thorn in the side and as a source of moral inspiration for the unlikely, often socially backward hero.It is hard to overestimate the seemingly boundless originality, ingenuity and creativity that have gone into the making of ""Shrek.""  Here is a film that can truly be enjoyed by viewers of all ages.  Children will revel in the glorious animation and the assorted lowbrow comic antics of Shrek, Donkey and even Princess Fiona, while more seasoned adults will delight in the sly in-jokes, bawdy innuendoes and clever anachronisms that pour forth in amazing abundance from the mouths of the characters.  There is never a dull moment, since the writers, William Steig and Ted Elliott, and the directors, Andrew Adamson and Vicky Jenson, always seem to have new and clever tricks up their sleeves.  Donkey, in particular, is the most amusing and endearing sidekick since the Robin Williams genie in ""Aladdin.""The script pokes marvelous fun not only at the whole fairy tale mentality, but also at the romanticized conventions of medieval life.  There are jousting knights, damsels in distress and an Inquisition-like rounding up of all those caught demonstrating any proclivity for the supernatural and the magical.  So much seems to be happening throughout the course of the film that a second viewing is surely in order, just so one can catch all those delicious details that might have slipped by on the first go-round.  (The gingerbread man interrogation scene is particularly hilarious).Despite its tone of sardonic playfulness, ""Shrek"" is, happily, not afraid to indulge in a bit of heartwarming sentimentality at times.  The romantic feelings that develop between the Princess and the Ogre are genuine and heartfelt, made palatable by all the flippancy going on around them.  In fact, Princess Fiona is very much a modern heroine, shrewd, matter-of-fact and able to roughhouse with the best of the boys this strange land has to offer.Special note must be made of the superb voice work, which is largely responsible for bringing these extraordinarily well-delineated animated characters to life on the screen.  Mike Myers (Shrek), Cameron Diaz (Princess Fiona), John Lithgow (Lord Farquaad) and, especially, the brilliant Eddie Murphy (Donkey) all turn in bell ringer performances.In every area of the filmmaking process, ""Shrek"" excels like no general audience film since ""Toy Story 2.""  Like that earlier work, ""Shrek"" provides audiences of all ages and all types with the joy that comes from seeing a superb idea superbly executed.  ""Shrek"" is an intelligent, witty and imaginative family film.  Be sure to catch it.  Films like this don't come along very often.",Shrek VHS
142829,"&quot;The Man in the Iron Mask&quot; was pretty much a Critical and Commercial Flop, in Australia, it opened in cinemas a year after &quot;Titanic&quot; and Mask was the first of the two to leave the cinemas. The Fault falls at the feet of Writer/Director Randall Wallace. His Formulaic and Overly Sentimental Writing, combined with his amature first time direction make the film Childish and Sickly when it should be at its most powerful, and Slow and Boring when it should be at it's most Exciting.Everyone else in the production of the film give there absolute best efforts. Costumes, sets, camera work; All top notch. The Acting is the films real saving grace. Without such a well known and talented cast, the film would have been a tele-movie. Even though the director seems to be pushing for very Stage-like performances, every actor manages to shine, though two actors stick out even more.Leonardo DiCaprio takes on two roles and he can make them completely different with the use of his eyes alone, and John Malkovich's performance shows a range of emotions that Malkovich isn't really known for, but he should be now.All round, I still have to say I was a little dissapointed.

Alone the way they speak out the name of the main person, Hikage (which they do a lot in the flic) is a pain to the ears. Plus they ruined the atmosphere of the movie's best parts by adding some additional sound effects which don't fit at all.This shows how much a good voice acting can give to a movie or take from it.Watch this movie with japanese audio and english subtitles (most of you are not familiar with japanese i guess), you won't regret it !",Blood Reign - Curse of the Yoma

679350,"It's been a long while since a horror movie has came anywhere close to those back in the eighties. While Jeepers Creepers doesn't exactly remind you of those campy horror films from over a decade ago, it's a breath of fresh air and different than the recent &quot;teen horror&quot; slasher films we've seen in the past few years. And I must say, it's about time.While driving home for college break, a brother and sister are tailgated by a psycho in a huge green truck. Later on, they come across the same truck parked beside an old abandoned church. They both see a mysterious figure dumping what seems to be several body bags down an old sewer pipe. A few moments later, the brother wants to go back to investigate, but the hesitant sister thinks it would be absolutely absurd to go back. After talking it over, and realizing that they could possibly save someone's life if they happened to be still alive, they decide to go back.What they then find is something horrendus. Soon they find out, that this madman knows that they've found his burial place. And it will stop at nothing to get what it wants. The thing itself, isn't even human. It's something far more evil and demonic. It's a monster. A monster that looks like a cross between Freddy Kreguer gone bad and the Lephrechaun.While the movie does fit some stereotypical cliches, what horror film doesn't? At least it's not another masked human figure stalking a bunch of helpless teens with an absurd motive. While the motive for this creature in Jeepers Creepers is mentioned, far more of it is left to the mind and remains mysterious. The acting in the film is quite good. The film itself isn't really scary, but it is very creepy and there's plenty of gore for everyone. I think horror fans should give this a try. Even if you don't like it, it's sure to be a change from the recent horror films you've seen.",Jeepers Creepers

437367,"I have no objection to the principle of film series. Star Trek, James Bond, and Carry On films prove that the Police Academy principle need not necessarily apply. However a prerequisite of any sequels ought to be that production standards are either maintained or surpassed. While there is no shortage of stars in this picture, acting talent is lacking in a couple of them. The three main females have acting ability, beauty, and sexiness, but sadly none has all three at the same time. Ron Perlman makes a good baddie, but why does Hollywood almost always portray people with facial disfigurement as evil? Think back to Phantom Of The Opera, Frankenstein, right through to the Batman films and you'll get my point. This is counterbalanced somewhat by the use of a strong wheelchair-bound character, although  sadly he is only present sporadically throughout the movie. The wheelchair is one of the best special effects used here, with the remainder being of poor quality or, in the case of the Alien creature, overexposed and overused. The menace and hence the appeal of the Alien is diminished y our clear views of it, and it looks like something a fan knocked up in a couple of days. The new Ripley is different from the old one, but not enough time is spent exploring the potential of this interesting sub-plot. The sequence where she discovers her predecessors is ham-fisted and telegraphed by the earlier shots of the number 8 tattooed on her body. A disappointment.",Alien Resurrection VHS

564339,"I thought this was surprisingly good for a Disney sequel. Tramp's son, Scamp, yearns to be a &quot;wild dog&quot; and sets out stubbornly to do so. Along the way we see many backgrounds from the first 'Lady and the Tramp'. Old characters are seen as well, from the Siamese cats to old Trusty and Jock. The plot itself is pretty good and goes along nicely. The only time your interest might wane is during the songs which aren't very up to par. The 'Junkyard Rag' started off great, but could've been much better. The characters are great and I really liked Buster. He was sort of like Steele (Balto) and Scar (Lion King) combined. The other Junkyard dogs seemed to fade into the background though once the story gets rolling. Lady's three girl pups, however, are hilarious, and their voices are perfect.The only problems I had with this movie was: The boring songs. How quickly the Junkyard Dogs, (except for Buster,) found a home. The annoying Dog Catcher. When Buster sees Tramp again after all these years he hardly reacts. And Scamp's odd voice. I thought Scamp's voice should've been younger, he sounds more like a teenage dog than a pup.Not quite as good as the original, but I still recommend it.

348565,"I don't know how aware the general public is that there is an big niche market of women who absolutely adore romantic drama or comedy stories set in Scotland. Although they like present day stories set there, it is the period pieces that they really go bonkers over.  This film is set in WWII Scotland, which now qualifies as history, in the wildest part of it, the Hebrides. Joan Webster (Wendy Hiller) travels there to marry a British industrialist, who she has never met, for his money. She is completely unapologetic about her proposed practical marriage of convenience and affluence. What completely throws her for a loop though is being marooned in a village due to the weather, where she meets handsome Scottish laird Torquil (Roger Livesey).  He rents his land to her fiance as a primary means of support.  It is the resolution of this triangle that is the plot of the film.  Hardly earthshattering stuff except that Michael Powell and Emeric Pressburger were the creative talents behind the film. Their being the top talent in the UK at the time was a reputation well deserved.  They crafted a small gem of a film here with a wonderful village and island offshore, peopled it with offbeat, eccentric characters and customs, and ultimately wrapped a love story around it that even involves an ancient curse and ruined castle of the laird's. I adored this curse and laughed for probably a full ten minutes when I read it.  I thought at first that maybe the film should have been shot in color but then saw a documentary on the DVD showing the place in color and realized that all the atmospheric conditions would have been lost.  An American film maker would not make this film the same way.  This is a very British film.  I would say that if you enjoyed, for example, Leslie Howard and Wendy Hiller in &quot;Pygmalion&quot;, which I did, you would equally enjoy this. If you hate all British films, in general, especially from earlier decades, then this 1947 film might not do a thing to change your mind.

223420,"A few years ago, I viewed this 1976 remake of the classic ""King Kong"" for my first time. My father and I both agreed that it paled when compared to the original. Recently, I got to view this one again on television. I still think it stinks, but it has a couple of good things going for it. However, lets do the bad first.First, The special effects are good but not as believable as one would think (Considering a 43-year time span). The stop-motion 18-inch Kong has been replaced by some five foot guy in an ape suit and a fifty foot robot Kong who has about 10 seconds of screen time. The best parts of the original film were all the dinosaurs that King Kong and the men of the SS Venture battled on Skull Island. The only opponent in this film is some plastic snake, which is killed the same way as the T-Rex was in 1933. Where did that amazing, $25 million budget go? That one million spent building the robot head (Today a prop at Universal Studios) should have been used for some dinosaurs (You could have bought costumes at the thrift shop). Also, Kong is subdued with Chloroform the moment he breaks through the gate. He does not do one bit of damage to the village or the natives, like in the original. If something valuable to me were just stolen, I would be in a foul, destructive mood. I also found more sympathy for the first King Kong in how he was taken away from his home and bundled up to become a sideshow freak. He was also a Christ-like figure when he died at the end. Here, I really didn't feel much for him since he wasn't shown to be much, except a giant who likes to smash people and to play with blondes.Next, the cast. Jeff Bridges plays Jack Prescott, who is a far cry from the Jack Driscoll that Bruce Cabot portrayed so well in 1933. Jack is a stowaway, rather than a mate on the ship, which is an interesting change in character. Anoil mogul named Fred Wilson (Played by Charles Grodin) replaces intrepid filmmaker Carl Denham He does get some laughs in this film and is somewhat fun, but is unable to save the film. Jessica Lange plays Dwan is her film debut. I have to say that I did admire her, not just for looks, but for her characterization. She doesn't scream as much as Fay Wray did in 1933. Instead, she punches or kicks a couple of times. She also seems to care for Kong, such as when Kong is shot at by helicopters on top of the World Trade Center. Instead of being happy, she yells at the pilots to stop their shooting. It fails, however, and Kong is killed (Or so it seems, for he would return in 1986 for the forgettable ""King Kong Lives"").But perhaps the biggest problem with the film is lack of suspense. Not much change is made to the plot beyond what I already stated.  Most of the scenes from the original have been kept, which reduces some suspense. A remake should try to do more than change around names. It should try to take a different outlook on the plot or on scenes in the original. This one didn't do that, which was a mistake. An example would be when Kong breaks out of Shea Stadium in New York and rampages around the city. We all know he will capture Dwan and climb up the highestbuilding, because that's what he wants to do and that's what he did in '33. Something the producers could have done was to have the humans use Dwan as bait to lure Kong up the World Trade Center, where he would meet his doom with the helicopters.However, as I said in the opening sentences, there are things I admired about this movie. In addition to Lange's character, there is more believability in the Skull Island voyage. Instead of an adventure for a legendary monster, it is a hopeful search for a large oil strike. There is a clever attempt at satire in this (The country was going through an oil crisis in 1976). I also liked how the film poked fun at itself. For example, after King Kong rampages off with Dwan in its grasp, her rescuers gaze at the damage done. When one of them asks what did it, another responded ""Who do you think it was? Some guy in an ape suit?"" Also, the music score in here is superb, adding some atmosphere to the film. It might even be on par with Max Steiner's film score. I also thought the cinematography, which received an Oscar nomination, was well done also. Finally, Rick Baker's ape suit is a great one and is very realistic, though that somewhat takes away from the campy fun of the original.This Kong is a controversial film. While it surpasses the original in a couple of ways and is one I will view once in a while, it fails to live up to its predecessor. One has to credit the cast and crew, however, for having the guts to make it. For it is truly a brave failure.",N/A

65928,"THE MAN WHO KNEW TOO MUCH is one of the rare films that Hitchcock started to shoot without a finished script (please read the book by Bill Krohn, HITCHCOCK at WORK), and he allowed James Stewart and Doris Day to improvise certain scenes. The reslut is amaizing, and proves the tremendous talent of those two actors. The scene in which Stewart tells Day about the kidnapping of their son is a perfect example; Stewart who plays a doctor gives her tranquilizer pills before breaking the news! These rich details permit Hitchcock to go more deeper than a very well made thriller which the original 1930's version was. The subtle tension between the couple makes them more believable, real and likable, and makes this film more engaging and ultimately more rich and emotional, because you believe in them inspite of the extraorodinary situations they are in. It's one of the most perfect Hitchcock film.In the making-of documentary of REAR WINDOW, restorationists Robert Harris and James Katz warn us about the horrible condition THE MAN WHO KNEW TOO MUCH. I guess they're right.While the transfer of this DVD is quite descent, the film elements from which this DVD is made are not in the best of condition. It looks like everything that can be done on electronic-digital domain is done to make the film look as beautiful as possible, but certain things could be done only by working on the film elements themselves. Alreday in the credit sequence, you would notice that the yellow on the letters are practically gone.More problems occurs on the composite shot done by back projection. They simply look, well, composite images, because they have badly faded. Now, Hitch and his regular cinematographer Bob Burks were masters of this illusionary technic. They would have not allowed the screen-processed scenes look as bad as this. Their magic of combining location footage (here, a lot of great shots from Morocco and London) hurts terribly because of the time that has passed.Judging from the opening logo which is an Universal one, it is obvious that this transfer was created from the early 80's re-release version. Originally, the film should have a Paramanount logo followed by the VistaVision logo (which itself looks great; I love that). I only hope that the original camera negatives and other film elements stay in a much better shape than this. And I do hope that Universal would ask Harris and Katz or somebody to do something about resucuing this masterpiece from being completely lost.For those who love the music of Bernard Herrmann as much as the films of his best partner Hitchcock, you can see the great master realising the dream of his life---to become a concert conductor; he is the conductor at the climatic Albert hall concert scenes.",N/A
241900,"If you've ever had to spend time on the road for business, you know how it feels to just want to get back home, especially for a holiday like Thanksgiving; the family's waiting for you, there'll be a fire in the fireplace and a turkey dinner with all the trimmings.  All you have to do is get from here to there.  But that's when Murphy's Law concerning best laid plans often comes into play, and the simplest things become obstacles of monumental proportions, which is exactly what happens in ""Planes, Trains and Automobiles,"" a comedy of monumental proportions, written and directed by John Hughes.  Neal Page (Steve Martin) is in New York on business; it's two days before Thanksgiving and he has a plane waiting to take him back home to Chicago.  He has his reservation, and it's not that far to go; but it's a holiday and the weather is chancy, and beginning with the trouble Neal has just getting a cab to take him to the airport, he's about to become mired in frustration as one thing after another thwarts his attempts to get home.  Not to worry, however, once on the plane he meets a guy named Del Griffith (John Candy), a showercurtain-ring salesman with all the answers and connections in seemingly every city in the country.  Which comes in handy-- or maybe not-- for Neal, when the weather in Chicago forces a closure at the airport and his flight gets diverted to Wichita, Kansas.  But that's only the beginning of Neal's problems, because Del Griffith is on the job, and he's the guy to know in a situation like this.  Or not.  And the next couple of days become a comedy of errors that takes Neal to the edge of sanity and the audience to the edge of hilarity.An astute student of human nature, John Hughes takes his observations and insights and translates them in this film into a story with which just about anyone is going to be able to identify.  We've all been in Neal's situation at one time or another, in one way or another, and if you've lived more than a day on the planet you certainly know a Del Griffith.  And Hughes has a way of bringing you into Neal and Del's world so that you are able to share their experience, while at the same time affording you the luxury of being able to observe it all at arm's length, which enables you to see the ""big picture"" and appreciate the inherent humor of it all.  And the bottom line is, this movie is a riot.  There's something of the spirit of Jack Lemmon's ""The Out-of-Towners"" about it, the whole idea of nature seemingly conspiring against the little guy, that keeps the laughs coming; and Hughes couldn't have had anyone better than Martin and Candy to put it across more successfully.Martin has an inspired way with physical comedy-- he can make walking down the street funny-- and he infuses it with a subtle, underlying sense that something is always going on inside him that's just as funny as what he's showing you.  It creates an air of anticipation, and he never fails to deliver on that promise.  Like Lemmon, he has the ability to play the ordinary guy in an extraordinary situation in a very real way, and then take it to the limit without going over the top.  And when the reserved, inner turmoil finally erupts, it has you laughing until your sides ache.  It's Lemmon standing in the middle of the street railing at the city of New York, and Martin confronting a rental car clerk and spelling it out for her in no uncertain terms what he thinks of her, her cars and life in general at that particular moment in time.  It's pure humor, and it works so well because there's absolutely nothing mean-spirited in the way it's delivered, which is something for which Martin-- and Lemmon before him-- deserves a nod of appreciation and acknowledgement; it's a fine art that few comic actors are, in fact, able to master.John Candy, meanwhile, puts his own natural abilities to the test in creating a character in Del that is the antithesis of Neal.  And he passes with flying colors.  Del is the big, lovable goof who wears his heart on his sleeve and holds nothing back.  With Del, what you see is what you get, and there's not a thought that goes through his mind, apparently, that he doesn't feel obliged to share with anyone and everyone who will listen.  Everything about Del is externalized to the point of being overwhelming, and yet Candy manages to convey the feeling that even he has something locked away that is for himself alone, and it's that which makes Del a well rounded character and makes him real.  Like Martin's, Candy's is a performance that is rich in detail and humanity, which makes Del believable, and a memorable character.  Candy was perfect for this part, one that he was seemingly born to play.  And he makes the most of it.The supporting cast includes Laila Robins (Susan), Michael McKean (State Trooper), Dylan Baker (Owen), Edie McClurg (Car Rental Agent) and Charles Tyner (Gus), with cameos by Kevin Bacon and William Windom.  More than just a funny movie, but one which exemplifies the ""human comedy,"" ""Planes, Trains and Automobiles"" is a triumph for Hughes, but more especially for his stars, Martin and Candy, who demonstrate a refined understanding of human nature and behavior through their respective characters that makes this film so endearing, memorable and entertaining.  This is one to watch again and again, whenever you're in need of a good laugh or just something to put a smile on your face.  This is one that will definitely fill the bill.  It's the magic of the movies.","Planes, Trains And Automobiles VHS"
166865,"You either love or hate Aldomovar films. This one may win over a new legion of fans but is very unlike most of his movies. So which is the real Aldomovar, the straight romanticist or the outrageous dierctor? Probably both but more bizarre than stright considering his style leans more to wacky characters verses isn't she sweet characters. This movie is different from any of his previous works in that it is, well for lack of a better word, mundane. This is not one of my favorite Aldomovar movies. The plot is simple, a woman is in crisis in her life, unhappy in her marriage, writing (romance) novels that are about everything she is missing in her life, and her denial of what she needs, real romance. Marisa Paredes, who has beeen hilarious in other Aldomovar films is just ok as the novelist in the story, Amanda Gris. Her full talents are not utilized though as she is not as funny in her depiction of Amanda, it's just not in the character I guess. Check out some of her other roles and you'll see what I mean, she's better in the other movies. Her husband is consumed with his career and other &quot;projects&quot;. It is a bit of a sad story and maybe too close to real life, that is why some will love it and others not. More women will like this than men, translation  dare I say, chick flick. This is more of a mainstream movie that departs from Aldomovar's usual flair for the unusual usual suspects.  For me this movie and the performances were just to ordinary. That said many will love it.",N/A

There is so much happening visually and aurally, with narrative conflicts and twists, plus changing political tides and intense philosophical issues - all of which truly tax the mind in a great way. The only drawbacks to the DVD version of the film are: 1.) the lack of a Japanese-language version, and 2.) the corny sounds attached to virtually all menu selections.

385560,"Another overlooked Hal Hartley gem with Martin Donovan playing an amnesia victim who is nursed to health by a nymphomaniacal virgin nun played by French actress Isabelle Huppert. Huppert is superb as the contradictory runaway nun who is trying to adapt to life outside the convent. Donovan, with amnesia and all, is confused anyhow, but also cannot understand how a nun can be a self-professed nymphomaniac without ever having had sexual relations. Huppert's nun is anxious to shed herself of her virginity and many times wants to do so with Donovan, but circumstances keep preventing them. I have not seen this movie in quite some time, but I recall that it is classic Hal Hartley, with a cast of wicked and crazy characters in unbelievable situations. Donovan's amnesia patient begins to learn that he was not such a nice guy in his pre-amnesia days as more characters come into focus and more things happen. Huppert stands by him nevertheless. Donovan pays for whatever is coming to him in the end, but not before Huppert manages to declare her love for him.",Amateur VHS

Several years might be closer to the truth, though my parents would call that an understatement. I happened upon this film at a Monty Python fan site. As one of my goals happens to be to watch every Python-related film I can get my hands on, I went to the local hastings and rented it. I liked it. A lot. It was somewhat childish, but was not without its python influences (There is this one scene in which Mr. Toad is being led to jail and there are 2 guards punching each other in the background. If that's not Pythonesque, then I don't know what is). The songs were delightful, most of them anyway. I thought that altogether the whole thing was really creative. There are a few &quot;violent&quot; parts, such as fighting, and something having to do with a dog food factory that reminds me very much of Wallace &amp; Gromit, but nothing that will lead your child to, say, becoming a Gang banger, or anything outrageous like that.",Mr. Toad's Wild Ride VHS
388335,"This is a good example of the very type of film that parents  should watch out for: an empty, non-challenging story that has just enough pretty cinematography to fool you into thinking that it might be more.  It is basically a &quot;save the panda&quot; plot that takes a small boy on a supposedly harrowing but utterly predictable journey.  The movie greatly underestimates the capacity of kids to find moral interpretations, understand symbolism, and interpret ambiguity.  What you get here is about an hour and a half of pretty predictability -- a movie that asks nothing of you as a viewer, gives nothing in return, and just  plods on with pretty images and a repetitious sound track that becomes quite irritating.  At least with the overtly &quot;bad&quot; children's films you can recoup some value by discussing how bad they are -- and why -- with your kids.  This movie doesn't even give you that opportunity.  Much better films are out there, including many &quot;classic&quot; films from earlier eras -- Walt Disney's &quot;20,000 Under the Sea&quot; or &quot;Mary Poppins&quot; for instance.

343725,"Sorry, but this has to be a dissenting opinion. As some of the other reviewers have noted, ""Superman and the Mole Men"" was later edited into a two-part episode for the George Reeves TV program, now rechristened as ""The Unknown People."" Sorry, folks, but in this case the ""edited for TV"" version is a distinct improvement and for one reason: THE MUSIC! The score used in the original movie is a pallid, third-rate job that does nothing to advance the action or to support the eerie, ""film noir"" feel of the camera work. But when the film was mixed down for presentation on TV, the show's producers had the genius to replace the film's soundtrack with some of the scariest, most vivid background scores then available.  (As a matter of fact, this weird and wonderful music - used over and over again as background music throughout the first, black-and -white season of the 1950's ""Adventures of Superman"" TV show - has been helpfully collected on CD by the Varese-Sarabande label. You can order it right here, at Amazon.com!The Adventures of Superman: Original Television Soundtrack (1950s TV Series)) Anyone who gets to know ""Superman and the Mole Men"" only through the original theatrical release with its substandard, tepid musical score will have no idea of how good the film really is, or understand how the effective use of great background music can turn a third-rate movie into a very good film.  Luckily for everyone, the DVD release of the first season of 'The Adventures of Superman' made both TV re-mix and original theatrical version of 'Mole Men' available for comparison.Adventures of Superman: The Complete First SeasonTrust me, after seeing the TV re-mix, you'll never want to watch the theatrical release again!",N/A
46449,"Anyone old enough to remember the Summer of '75 will recall the sheer terror caused by the 20-foot mechanical shark in Steven Spielberg's classic horror film &quot;Jaws&quot;. Not only did this flesh-ripping Great White take a huge chunk out of the worldwide box office, it also put a dent in the profits of beach towns on both coasts. No one wanted to go anywhere near the ocean! Heck, you couldn't even jump into a kiddie pool without some prankster breaking into a couple bars of the classic &quot;Jaws&quot; theme. (Da-Dum-Da-Dum-Da-Dum...) The media, in fact the whole world, was caught up in a stupifying feeding frenzy of Shark-Mania. You see, &quot;Jaws&quot; wasn't merely a movie; it was an EVENT! It was the original Summer Blockbuster. But, unlike the majority of mega-movies it spawned, &quot;Jaws&quot; was worth every penny of the $3.50 we movie-goers forked over in 1975. In a stroke of genius, Spielberg kept us squirming by not allowing us to see the toothy, blood-lusting shark for the first hour of the film. We only witnessed the bone-crunching damage that this monster had inflicted. When the Great White finally surfaced, a collective gasp could be heard throughout the theatre. Nevertheless, we had faith in Richard Dreyfuss, Robert Shaw and Roy Scheider -- the heroic hunters who set off to sea in a small fishing vessel named, ironically, &quot;Orca&quot;. But, alas, we knew that indeed they'd need &quot;a bigger boat&quot;. The inevitable showdown between man and maneater was more horrifying than anything we'd ever seen on the big screen. But, ultimately, in the end, we let out a whopping round of applause and got right back in line to see it again. (Well, some of us unemployed youth actually hid in the bathroom between shows!) Everything about &quot;Jaws&quot; worked. The suspense, the music, the chemistry of the stellar cast and, of course, the big rubber shark kept us coming back for more. Finally, after years of suffering through heavily edited pan and scan versions on Cable TV, we are treated to a beautiful widescreen version of &quot;Jaws&quot;. This DVD is truly worth it. The print itself is crisp and clean. The entire soundtrack, most notably John Williams' chilling score, is greatly enhanced by the DTS. For my money, the &quot;Making of Jaws&quot; documentary included within is worth the price of admission alone. Overall, a job well done and quite befitting of this all-time classic.

27015,"If Hitchcock's Psycho can be called the father of the modern slasher film, than PEEPING TOM must be the mother of them.  Director Michael Powell (Black Narcissus, The Red Shoes) kissed his career goodbye when he made this still disturbing, denounced, and banned film about a psychotic serial killer (much like Tod Browning did when he made Freaks). Most of the film is told from the perspective of a disturbed serial killer and several murder scenes are shown from the perspective of the killer and these are the ones which upset people a great deal in 1960.  The film has many thematically similar ideas to Hitchcock's Rear Window and voyeurism.  This film however took ideas where no man had gone before and did so in color.  It's still a sometimes surprisingly brutal film, though it's minimal gore is quite tame by today's standards.I'm sure there will be some who will call the film's mixture of psychological terror, voyuerism and mild gore dull.

271805,"There are days-- and everybody has them-- when no matter what you do things just don't go the way you planned, and by the end of the day you're thinking maybe you should've just kicked back and had that second cup of coffee.  And on a day like that, you can bet the odds are pretty good that even lightening can, in fact, strike the same person twice, which is exactly what happens in the action packed ""Die Hard 2,"" directed by Renny Harlin, and starring Bruce Willis as LAPD Detective John McClane.  It's Christmas time again, and McClane is at Dulles International Airport in Washington, D.C., awaiting the arrival of his wife, Holly (Bonnie Bedelia), whose plane is scheduled to land within a couple of hours.  It's snowing, the weather is chancy and the traffic in the air is heavy; still and all, things are good, and McClane is looking forward to spending the holidays with Holly and her parents.  What he doesn't know is that there are some people waiting in the wings to change all that-- and they are about to make life miserable for McClane and everyone within their proximity.It just so happens that a deposed drug lord, General Ramon Esperanza (Franco Nero), is being extradited to the U.S. to stand trial for cocaine trafficking, and his plane is scheduled to touch down at Dulles shortly.  but he doesn't intend to stay around long.  A small army of mercenaries-- all former U.S. Army commandos-- are in the process of being deployed in and around the airport, with the intention of doing what they do best:  Making war and creating havoc, and effecting the escape of the man to whom they have sworn allegiance, General Esperanza.  Under the command of the fanatic and psychotic Colonel Stuart (William Sadler), the mercenaries are ruthless, their tactics are brutal and they are determined to carry out their mission successfully at all costs.  Toward that end they've planned a precision military operation right down to the smallest detail.  But their plans failed to include the contingency of encountering a one-man wrecking crew, and they're about to meet him.  His name is John McClane.With this sequel, director Harlin devised, crafted and delivered an action film that has exactly what an action film is supposed to have:  Action, and plenty of it.  And once it starts, it never lets up until the screen has gone dark, and it's one wild ride.  It has the added bonus, as well, of having a storyline to back it all up, all of which Harlin presents in a satisfying, cohesive package.  As with even the best offerings of the genre, however, this one requires a certain suspension of disbelief, but there's so much happening so quickly that it doesn't require much effort.  A couple of key scenes are built around things that could only be accomplished through the use of creative license, but it doesn't make any difference; it works for the story and Harlin integrates it so well into the action that it all seems real, and unless you're an expert in a certain field you wouldn't know the difference anyway.  The important thing is, it's exciting and entertaining.One element that puts this film a cut above many action movies is the fact that the characters have at least been developed beyond being mere comic book caricatures; these are people with whom you are able to become emotionally involved because they have very real concerns, feelings and relationships.  They just happen to be confronted at this juncture of their lives by extraordinary circumstances.  The relationship between McClane and Holly, for example, adds that element of humanity that makes the film more than ""just"" a special effects extravaganza.  Willis does a good job of bringing McClane to life with a credible, believable performance, as does Bedelia as Holly.The supporting cast includes a number of actors who were virtually unknown at the time, but who have gone on to have significant careers in their own right, like Dennis Franz (Lorenzo), Vondie Curtis-Hall (Miller), Robert Patrick (O'Reilly) and John Leguizamo (Burke).  Also in the cast are William Atherton (Thornburg), Reginald VelJohnson (Powell), John Amos (Grant), Tom Bower (Marvin) and Sheila McCarthy (Samantha Coleman).  The role of John McClane catapulted Bruce Willis to international stardom, and reprising the character in ""Die Hard 2"" virtually crowned him King of the action genre.  Harlin did a terrific job with this one, Sadler created a memorable villain with Colonel Stuart, and like your favorite ride at your favorite amusement park, it's thrilling-- and as soon as it's over, chances are you're going to want to go again.

It gives all of the Tribal Councils, and who voted for the person that got booted off at that particular Council.This video goes through each person one by one, and it ultimately ends up with that person getting voted off.  The only problem here is that each sequence is too brief; we get maybe two or three key scenes for each character, and then we're back to Tribal Council.There are still some classic scenes that were not left on the cutting room floor.  Things like Alicia's and Kimmi's &quot;finger waving head bobbing&quot; scene; and the very gripping sequence where Mike falls into the fire.  But so many other things are omitted - things like Colby's mom coming to visit, and Mike chasing after the boar.  Many of the Immunity Challenges are left out, as well.At the end of the video, the final ten contestants' appearances on The Early Show are shown.  These are not the full interviews, but rather, just snippets of the interviews.In short, this is a fine video that wanted to be better.  Here's hoping that someone realizes a DVD or VHS set of the whole series would be a smart idea.

Fifteen minutes into this film, we were both equally charmed by it and Mel Gibson, whose talent as a romantic lead is not dimmed by age.  Every fifteen minutes one or the other of us muttered about how had this gotten such bad reviews.  I had heard Gibson was too old for this role too.  That is not true either and he is a lot younger than Cary Grant was when he bowled everyone over romantically in &quot;North By Northwest.&quot;  Both hubby and I were also thinking back to the romantic comedies of decades ago and were delighted to see its resurrection here.  Need I say this had Doris Day and Rock Hudson type charm?  I guess I better and remind viewers that &quot;Pillow Talk&quot; and &quot;Lover Come Back&quot; were huge, engaging hits with similar material.  The gist of the story is that top ad man Gibson does not get the top job at his agency because it goes to Helen Hunt.  He gets the ability to read women's minds by accident and schemes to get Hunt's job with this newest gift.  He starts falling in love with Hunt though as he steals her ad ideas right out of her head. He has a brief patient-shrink visit with Bette Midler and one of his funniest bits is finding out that women really think he is an incredible jerk! He didn't have a clue, thinking that he was God's gift to women instead. Gibson has some solo moments in the movie which are just great.  He tries on all of a woman's cosmetic products at home one night to learn how to sell them.  This was hilarious, especially watching him wriggle into panty hose.  He also dances with a hat rack a la Fred Astaire and is surprisingly good at it.  This film was directed by a woman, Nancy Meyers, and we both thought that showed in the best sense possible as it was a pleasure to see Gibson not being beaten up or used as action-adventure fodder for a change.  In fact, I haven't enjoyed seeing him in a movie this much in a long, long time and I can remember back to seeing him in his original &quot;Mad Max&quot; movie in the 1970s when it opened in the USA and loving it and seeing him in &quot;Tim&quot; shortly after that and loving that too.  Helen Hunt does a very solid job here too as the female lead but it is obviously a lesser part to Gibson's starring role.  They have very good chemistry together.",N/A
332424,"I was advised against buying the previous DVD issues, although this is one of my favorite films.  I heard how the sound was poor and the visuals were cloudy.  WEll, I'm used to watching this on a VHS tape that has been played too many times.  The sound and images on THIS DVD are first-rate.  I would agree that the dvd Collector's Edition could have had more extras.  The bottom line is the quality of the visual and auditory presentation.  According to Widescreen Review, both are improvements over the previous DVD releases.  This movie is not for everyone -- if you read the Amazon reviews you'll see what I mean! If you want to experience this film, this collector's DVd will give you what you are looking for.  I found the images crisp and the sound much better than expected.  Remember, this is a film made in the late 60's!!  The special effects still stand up to anything seen today!  I've seen quotes from George Lucas... he agrees!  If you can stay through the entire movie, you will be treated to 3, 4, or 5 of the finest sequences in the history of film!  On my widescreen TV with full 5.1 surround sound, I'm very impressed with the presentation!  The sequence from the ages of man to the Space Baby still gives me chills... and so much more to contemplate!",N/A
67914,"This movie is surely one of the year&#8217;s best movies and an instant classic. Never have I seen a movie that tapped into the real, true depiction of suburban life as this movie did.The story revolves around Lester Burnham, a lonely husband and father whose life has slipped away before his eyes. He and his family have not been getting along well, and things are not right. In fact, he is already dead. Yes, the narrator, Lester, is talking to us from beyond the grave.He wakes up every morning, attends his job in advertising, and goes home to his family to have dinner and socialize. This family has slowly fallen apart over the years, and everyone has issues, especially Lester. His wife and daughter both think that he is a loser. His daughter does not want anything to do with him. He is too &#8220;weird&#8221; for her to be around. His wife is a real-estate agent, who is in a high competition with another firm.Like I said before, everyone in this movie has issues. Jane, Lester&#8217;s daughter is your basic, depressed teenager filled to the brims with angst. She feels that she is not attractive, and to not be attractive makes you &#8220;ordinary&#8221;. She has been saving money for ... implants, and is totally determined to change her image.Lester&#8217;s wife, Carolyn, is having problems with her business. She has not sold a home in a long while, and usually goes into deep depression when she does not sell. She also puts out an image of herself. Everything around her has to be perfect. Her whole image is just a front to cover the pain that she is feeling inside. She feels that if the house is not cleaned right or the roses are not trimmed to utter perfection, then she is worthless.  She often listens to self-help cassettes, and starts off everyday with a lip-syncing of &#8220;Don&#8217;t Rain on my Parade&#8221;. She is an emotional wreck from beginning to end.Then, one night at a high school basketball game, Lester catches sight of a beautiful cheerleader, Angela Hayes, Jane&#8217;s best friend. He becomes awestruck as he watches her in amazement, and from there on, she is all that he can think about, and he would do anything to get her. He starts fantasizing about her. Something in him sparks. He realizes that he would do anything to attract her to him.Meanwhile, the new next-door neighbor, Ricky Fitts, has his own problems. His dad is an ex-military officer and is very demanding and beats him often, telling him that he needs &#8220;structure and discipline&#8221;. His mother is clearly not there. Her mind is always in outer space, and she never seems to notice all of the chaos that is going on around her. Ricky films everything around him with his camera. Everything is beautiful to him. He sees beauty in the most abnormal things: a plastic bag, a dead bird, even a dead man.Ricky also benefits in Lester&#8217;s changing attitude. He influences Lester to stand up for himself and take crap from no one. He also introduces Lester to pot. Lester goes to work the next day and blackmails his boss, then quits his job, and applies to work at the local Mr. Smiley&#8217;s fast food restaurant. He also starts to work out in order to attract young Angela to him.The rest of the movie is a chronicle of what many of today&#8217;s families are going through. Most of it is disturbing, but it is all an effort to get this most important message out.  Everyone in this movie eventually goes through a change, and this movie should change you also, as you realize what the suburban world is really like today.",Belleza Americana American Beauty  VHS
483113,"An old friend rented &quot;Nashville&quot; recently, then wrote me to ask if she was missing something. This is what I wrote her:&lt;&lt; The peer pressure among film reviewers to laud &quot;Nashville&quot; began before the film even came out, when Pauline Kael took the highly unorthodox and ethically dubious step of raving in The New Yorker over a rough cut that Altman screened especially for her. But more than even this, I think the reason &quot;Nashville&quot; got a free ride was that it passed itself off as &quot;an epic canvas of American life.&quot; Reviewers are suckers for hype like that. That &quot;Nashville&quot; is exactly like every other Altman movie, in which the director expresses his thinly veiled contempt for his freaky characters, seems not to have occurred to any of them. (Altman particularly enjoys seeing women humiliated with nudity - i.e. &quot;MASH&quot;, &quot;Ready to Wear&quot;, &quot;Short Cuts&quot;, etc.) He also manages to express contempt for the audience by making his soundtrack an incomprehensible muddle of overlapping dialogue - a pretentious little trick that the reviewers also eat up with a spoon. And &quot;Nashville&quot; lingers painfully in my memory as perhaps the visually ugliest film I've ever seen. &gt;&gt;Of the 34 comments posted before mine, only 1 dared to suggest that Bobby A.'s chef-d'oeuvre might be something less than a supreme masterpiece of American cinema. On behalf of my friend and those like her who lack the courage to speak out, let me state for the record that not only is &quot;Nashville&quot; not on par with the great films of the 70s, it is, like most of the rest of Altman's oeuvre, an amateurish piece of garbage. It is inferior in conception, execution, and artistic insight to many hundreds of other movies from that decade including, say, &quot;Can't Stop The Music&quot;.If there is a more glaring case of the Emperor's New Clothes than the continuing deference... ...by the film community, I don't know about it.",Nashville
423260,"As truly american films go, there is always a hero which blazes the trail of the unknown. Robert Redford plays a man sick and tired of city life and (much like Dances With Wolves) finds himself alone in a ravaging frontier. He meets wild men in winter with skins on their back's, wild men in summer that have shaved their heads to keep their scalp, and a crazy woman that has lost all she has and taken upon with pitty. As humorous in stuggle as it is heartbreaking, Jeremiah Johnson stands tall with cinema's American Heroes. It can be listed with the &quot;Lone Man&quot; movies such as Rob Roy, Brave Heart, Dances With Wolves, and Last of the Mohican's. If you appreciate these mentioned films then you will most definately enjoy it. When he looses everything, and fight's alone against Braves one at a time, you will cheer his strength, and laugh at his attempts. Jeremiah Johnson starts as a person not befitting a meal for a Griz, but in the end becomes a legend.",N/A
419580,"I was simply shocked at how good ""Having A Wild Weekend"" was after seeing it for the first time recently.  The DC5's film borrows the fast pace, ingenious cuts, sense of sprightly enthusiasm and b&w; artiness of ""A Hard Day's Night"", but matches it with a unique plot of its own. Rather than playing themselves, the group here are stuntmen, and the story revolves around one of them (Steve, played by the self-described saturnine Dave Clark) taking a model out for a ""wild weekend"". The press, egged on by her boss, turn it into a kidnapping story, and the rest of the film follows their attempt to recapture her before she gets to the island she's planning to buy. A suitably thin plot is thickened by scenes which are slightly ahead of their time in dramatic and culturalcontent--Steve and his girl encounter a group of long-haired ex-beatniks who ask for grass and heroin, and quote Zen koans-- and all of this in 1965! A comically bickering couple who eventually takes them in also provides for a marvellous costume party sequence in which director John Boorman, in his first film, shines. The climax, in which the journey is compared to the final result, makes for an interesting discussion; the film's themes of youth vs. elders, people vs. the press/society and the resulting question of whether it was ""worth it"" or not would become the riding question of the 60s. It's almost like an ""Easy Rider"" before its time-- the big question then becomes why the DC5 faded soon after this film's release, not being known as counterculture heavies in the least...",Having a Wild Weekend VHS
227463,"This has to be one of my favorite sci-fi/horror movies. The special effects are some of the best, and I repeat, the BEST you'll ever see! Jeff Goldblum is fabulous as a scientist who invents machines that transport matter from one place to another, called telepods. He decides to use himself as a guinea pig and transports himself. When he comes out, he feels like he's on top of the world. But all is not right........a fly gets in with him in the telepod, and he find out the fly has fused with him, and slowly but surely he begins to turn more and more into an insect. Geena Davis is also great as the love interest. &quot;The Fly&quot; is sure to please any sci-fi buff, if you have the stomach to take it.

I hope they make more Highlander movies with Duncan, Joe, and Methos, or at least bring back the series (I really miss it, the new series &quot;The Raven&quot; sucked).

569453,"From the outside, Dex is large, messy, and almost totally unmotivated (he does teach pre-school part-time), yet because of his undeniable cuteness and completely perfected Taoism on Sex and Relationships, he is **completely irresistible** to women. Well, to all the women in the world, except one. Guess Who he falls in love with!The opening credits of ThE TAO oF STeVE are displayed against the spines of philosophy books on a bookshelf, a reference to the many philosophies which have been honed and perfected by Dex, in his quest to become the most irresistible guy possible. His philosophies, culminating in 'The Tao of Steve,' (based on the belief that every ""truly cool guy"" in the world has been named Steve, most notably Steve McQueen) which instructs its 'disciples' (a couple of Dex's friends who follow Dex's thoughts mainly because he is so damn successful with the ladies, they all agree he must be doing something right!!) to follow three golden rules, basically The Rules but for Men. And the prize isn't marriage and a mortgage, it's Sex. I think the main rule was ""We pursue that... which retreats from us."" He will say that, do some cute mannerism, then say something like, ""Think about it."" Hilarious.The first major scene reveals Dex at his best, and, as we'll see, his worst. He's having hot, stand-up sex against a row of library books.... but it's with his friend's wife! (they are having an affair). As the scene pans out, we see that this is taking place during a college reunion while the rest of his friends are outside in the courtyard, milling about, drinks in hand, sun beating down. And we see that there's a girl out there, playing the drums, temporarily unaware of Dex and his current, er, activity. And we'll come to find out that, given a bit of time, and a few tugs on Dex's heart-strings, this not completely unfamiliar woman has got a thing or two to teach our hero... that no book or self-obsessed philosophy could ever accomplish!! It's all uphill from there.... well, you'll see. He might have a chance at True Love!!A lot of the comic force of the movie comes from this look into our habits, and the Garfield-esque slouch which has resulted from Dex having so many bad ones. He's a smart guy, and he does have a conscience -- he knows what he should or shouldn't do... he just can't help himself, and he has no motivation to change. If anything, all these adoring women and fun times have pushed him in the other direction. That is, until he meets Syd, the drummer-girl with the looks, the brains, and the attitude to stop 10 Dex's dead in their tracks. This woman will NOT be played, and she won't settle for a guy whose habits involve eating whipped cream straight from the can (and sharing some with the dog(!)), being habitually late to everything, flirting incessantly with anything in a skirt, and, especially, sleeping with the wife of one of his best friends.So....will true love prevail, and give our Dex the kick in the pants he needs to change his life? To go for the girl, and not just the chase?? Watch this fabulous movie, and see for yourself! (Hint, what's missing in predictability and plot is SO MUCH MORE THAN MADE UP FOR by the natural, glowing presence of the actors, and the amazingly funny dialogue. The director deserves much praise for her ability to create a realistic atmosphere and a warm, familiar mood among her actors. Top notch independent film material, this one.)This is one of the funniest, smartest, natural, giddy, hilarious, classic films I have ever seen! There are so many good lines, I can't even stand it. It was filmed in New Mexico (Santa Fe), and as such the mood is warm, sunny, and light, complete with sunny interiors, patio parties, motorcycles, and desert scenes. At the Seattle International Film Festival, this film had people rolling in the aisles laughing. Rent it, Buy it, whatever... just SEE THIS MOVIE!!You might recognize its rising star, the cutest red-haired round guy I've ever seen, Donal Logue, from his new Fox sitcom, ""Grounded For Life."" In my opinion, his skills are somewhat wasted in that series, but no matter, I'm sure we'll be seeing more and more of him as time goes on. Enjoy!",The Tao of Steve
675935,"&quot;Velvet Goldmine&quot; meets &quot;(insert name of your favorite Backstage Drama here)&quot; in this instant cult classic. The secret to &quot;Hedwig&quot;'s success is that it doesn't hit you over the head with the &quot;sexual ambiguity&quot; theme (after 25 years of &quot;Rocky Horror&quot; and several generations of Glamrock revivals, I think we &quot;get it&quot; by now, wam bam, thank you m'am.) Once the main character's androgynous &quot;issues&quot; are established, you can sit back and enjoy a surprisingly traditional show-biz tale with just the right mixture of pathos, bathos and clever one-liners. Best of all, (one or two interminable Jim Steinman-style power ballads aside) someone has finally nailed the MUSIC...most of the songs sound like they were indeed composed by Mssrs. Pop, Bowie, Reed or Bolan and would hold up alongside the original artists' work. (I was noting the rich, Marshall-amped Ronsonesque power chord sound throughout and was surprised to see none other than Bob Mould pop up in the musician's credits at the end!)

93236,"Ever since I was born I've heard the claim that America is the land of the free, with a strong belief in freedom of speech. Why, then, does a film that presents an opinion get dragged through the mud?Before seeing the film I'd read many books regarding the assassination. Going in, I had my own opinion that Oswald could not have killed Kennedy. There was definitely the possibility that he'd been involved, but he couldn't have done the shooting.This film presents the idea that the CIA had been invloved - something I agree with - but primarily it follows the case of Clay Shaw. Personally, I don't believe he had been involved. And if he was, it was unknowingly. Like Oswald, I think he was used. Like many people it would seem.The films most positive trait is its willingness to leave room for you to come to your own conclusions. It presents many well known, and some not so well known, facts. As an assistant to Jim Garrison [our main character] says, when referring to Oswald supposedly doing the shooting from the Book Depository, &quot;that's the whole essence of the case to me. The guy couldn't do the shooting&quot;. Coupled with all the reports of witnesses to a man behind the fence on the knoll, and the clear evidence that more than three shots were fired, we know that many of the reports are a fabrication.The most important question it asks is not who killed Kennedy, but why he was killed. The idea of it having to do with Vietnam is a little far fetched, but worth considering. Garrison's meeting with Mr. X is especially revealing, when you discover how much basic Secret Service protocall was ignored that day.The special features are excellent. Oliver Stone's commentary is insightful, and the 50 minutes of cut scenes worth watching twice [with and without commentary]. Also impressive was the enourmous amount of chapter selections, coming in at over 80. The multimedia essays are a little dull, but it's to be expected. A lot of effort has gone in to this DVD and it shows.The film is, despite your opinion of what actually happened that day, excellent. The brilliant editing, along with John Williams' usual top notch score, cap off an already intriguing concept.Watch with an open mind and you won't be disappointed.",JFK Director's Cut
89979,"""Blade Runner"" relies on two tremendous driving forces. The heralded visuals which have been imitated countlessly over the years, not just in science fiction, but music video, thrillers and commercials. While Blade Runner itself borrows a few elements from Fritz Lang's ""Metropolis"", it distances itself from the great German piece with a realism that is uncharacteristically grounded (pun intended) for science fiction.The startling thing about Blade Runner is that every year that passes by, Los Angeles bears a closer resemblance to this skin grafting, smog congested, racist society that was projected by novelist Philip K. Dick, director Ridley Scott, visualist Syd Mead and screenwriters Hampton Fancher and David Peoples. Organ and tissue implants are better known today as plastic surgery. LA is a town in which such an emphasis is placed on physical appearance. Inevitably, clones created from a superior genetic stock would arise in a society such as this.The Director's Cut gives the smoky and towering visuals more breathing room and the subtleties of Ridley Scott's detail come to light. The central conflict and irony of this film is that you have a sardonic Humphrey Bogart disenchanted Blade Runner commissioned to seek and retire all androids, regardless of their own personal involvement in a crime that was committed Off-World. This forces the androids to kill in order not to be killed.Just who is the true protaganist of this film? Deckard is just doing his job, and is, for the most part, a static character. One moment largely affected by the additional unicorn scene is when he finds the origami unicorn on the floor. This is one of the few intuitive moments where Deckard reflects on the human nature of his own being. The unicorn is a dream that Deckard imagines, and dreams are our own to treasure and fear. The origami folding Gaff places the very mythical creature in his dreams. He dissects Deckard's mind much in the same manner that Deckard smashes Rachael's precious childhood memories.I could go on much longer, but for the sake of this recommendation, I hope the complexity of this story speaks for itself. It is emotional in a deep sense and the visuals are stunning for its time. Many of the model techniques and wire effects outdo its contemporary rivals who utilize digital effects. They are close to 20 years old, and still drop jaws all across the world.",Blade Runner
529480,"&quot;The war on drugs&quot; is something we've all heardabout. Many feel that much has been done to stop it. And, at one time,I also thought the exact same thing myself. But, after watching one ofthe most powerful films I've seen not only this year, but on thesubject of drugs, I now feel, this is a &quot;war&quot;, we'll neverwin!  Director Steven Soderbergh (who's had an amazing year), has madea film that many might see as an eye opening experience. Thescreenplay by Stephan Gaghan based on the miniseries&quot;Traffik&quot; by Simon Moore, is so real that it's almostimpossible to get involved. The characters reminded me of people Iactually know of personally or causally.  The story is about threedifferent drug cartels on the verge of going under. I refuse to giveany important or slightest detail of this masterpiece. The less youknow going into this film, the more you'll be able to enjoy it. I willhowever try to describe a very brief outline. Something enough so itwill arouse your curiosity.  The first of the three stories includes amexican cop named Javier Rodriguez Rodriguez (Benicio Del Toro), whois ordered to find the leading dealer in mexico, and bring him toGeneral Arturo Salazar (Tomas Milian), who is determined to take downeveryone, but not for the reasons we are lead to believe.  The secondstory involves a wealthy &quot;business man&quot;, Carlos Ayala(Steven Bauer), who is arrested, take a guess why! His unknowing wifeHelena (Catherine Zeta Jones) is know an outcast in theneighborhood. She must explain to her son what is going on, whileMontel Gordon (Don Cheadle) a cop is watching her, wanting to know ifshe knew about her husbands affairs.  Things start to look bleak forCarlos when a prime witness Eduardo Ruiz (Miguel Ferrer) is brought into testify against him. But,the question is now, will he still bealive to make it to the witness stand.  I have now saved the best forlast. The last story in this film deals with Ohio Judge RobertWakefield (Michael Douglas) who is strongly fighting for &quot;the waragainst drugs&quot;.  He is determined to stop mostly teens from beingable to get to the stuff.  His high school 16 year old daughterthough, sees things differently. She is played brillantly by ErikaChristensen. I have no idea how old this girl is a real life, but allI can say after seeing her performance is, she is absolutely amazing!The way she was able to portray is character is unbelieveable. She wasable to handle to character in such a real character. It was likewatching one of the many kids I went to high school who have thisproblem.  There're also wonderful performances by people whom I'vefailed to mention like Amy Irving who plays Barbara Wakefield,Douglas's wife. Dennis Quad plays a friend\associate of Carlos Ayala,Arnie Motzger. Plus keep your eyes open for a cameo performance byAlbert Finney as the Chief of Staff.  Here is a wonderful, strong,real, film that really explores what is going on today in our countryas far as drugs are concerned. There are few films that really touchpeople in some special way. While we all may have our own list, thisfilm goes on mine.  The only downfall to this film is it's a littleover 2 and a half hours. I heard many people complain after watchingthe movie. The same way people avoided films like &quot;Meet JoeBlack&quot; and &quot;The Green Mile&quot;, I'm afraid people willalso avoid this. This is a first rate film with a first rate cast thatremains to be one of the best films of 2000!",N/A

479303,"With the early Hammer films (Quatermass, Horror of Dracula, Frankenstein) this is surely one of the best features the studio ever made.For once Christopher Lee is cast as the hero, one Duc de Richleau, a change from the usual malevolent characters he always seems to play. The plot is very staightfoward, a friend of the de Richleau becomes involved with an satanic cult, being an expert on such matters he immediately realises the severity of his friends obsession. With the hep of his friend Rex Van Ryn (Leon Greene) they discover that this occult is overseen by Mocata (Charles Gray) and are determined to put a stop to it.  Such a plot is the usual staple of B-movie Devil worship shenigans but be prepared for some intelligent filmmaking of this genre. Director Terence Fisher plus Christopher Lee plus a good sreenplay plus good production values always yields a decent movie, this being a very good example.  With regards to Mocata (Charles Gray) a particular scene where he attemps to hypnotise his way into the &quot;Safe House&quot; is one of my favorite film moments.  Five stars to Anchor Bay for another excellent presentation. The presentation is anamorphically enhanced for widescreen viewing (1.66:1) and with a quite superb 5.1 Dolby Digital remastered soundtrack (Considering it was made in 1968 I suspect some artistic license was used in its production however the JAMES BERNARD score is very vivid and far removed from the usual mono recordings you would get on VHS).  As with &quot;Dracula Prince OF Darkness&quot; the commemtary with the film is informative feauring Christopher Lee.",N/A

529680,"I can't believe how many people completely missed the point of this movie. In reading reviews it's very easy to tell who expected a Disney/Hollywood epic and who was ready to accept the movie for what it was. The film attempts to show the reality of America's drug problem and it does so with various techniques, primarily by using handheld cameras and rough editing, making you feel like part of the action.What most people misunderstand about this movie is the very premise upon which it stands. Namely, drugs are everywhere and nobody is immune from their effects. Even upper-class white prep-school students are doing it. And I can't even believe the idiotic comments I've read that cite this portion of the movie as unbelievable because these rich kids did drugs for ""no apparent reason."" Did you *watch* the film? That's its point! If people believe that these rich white kids aren't doing drugs because ""there's no apparent reason for it"" then what are they really saying? What *are* these ""apparent reasons"" they mention? Being poor? Being black? Coming from a broken home? It's amazing how transparent our culture becomes when we discuss these issues. What we really believe becomes clear.This movie at least tried to dispel the myth that the only hard-drug users in America are poor blacks in the inner city. Most negative reviews come from people who just can't accept that fact and are truly part of the problem that the heroes of the movie are trying to defeat. The greatest ally of this problem is people not believing there really is one.On a filmmaking level, I appreciate what the director was attempting to do. The film was raw and had a documentary feel to it. If you want the Disney version of a drug movie that makes you feel safe and sound as long as you stay away form cities and/or minorities, don't watch this. But if you want a film that makes you feel like you are actually one of its characters and that your own mother might be on something, then Traffic is your movie.Any time a film that tries to depict the reality of a situation is made, we usually will see two camps of reviewers - loved it or hated it. That's because one group was able to understand the movie and what it was trying to do and the other group gets upset because they weren't ""entertained"" by it, the camera shakes a lot, there weren't enough special effects, the film was grainy, etc., just missing the point totally. This film was trying to wake people up from their coma and realize that America has a serious drug problem, and everyone is affected by it. Usually we don't realize this until it's too late (as in Michael Douglas' character's case). I'm amazed at how many people still seem to have their head buried in the sand after seeing it, citing the fact that rich white kids doing drugs is an ""unbelievable"" element of the movie. It must be nice to live in their enchanted fantasy world where rich white people don't use drugs.On a final note, the DVD itself gets only 3.5 stars. For such a unique movie there are very few extra features on the DVD discussing it. There isn't even a commentary, which in my opinion is just inexcusable in this age of technology. There is no reason to not include these extra features, other than the fact they want to later release a special edition with a commentary and make us buy both versions.",N/A
72114,"this has to be one of the better recent films i have seen.  the film had attracted a lot of controversy, so i figured what the heck, i'll go.  and rightfully so.  the film is very, very violent (but one wonders how a blatant yuppie like patrick would obtain a chainsaw...) but the violence is just so funny.  i, honestly, have never seen a funnier portrayal of yuppies than in this film.  the film lacks the book's hilarious use of brand names, but other than that this is solid.so, why, might you ask, did i not give it 5 stars?well, first, i'm all senile and stuff, and second, yeah, it can get a bit ridiculously over the top sometimes.  but you should still see it.",American Psycho VHS
