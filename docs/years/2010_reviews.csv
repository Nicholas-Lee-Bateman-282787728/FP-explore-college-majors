It is not really instructional but more of a demonstration. Like many of the ""hot licks"" dvd's its not really structured learning, more of a musician demonstrating some licks. But Gatten moves too fast and is very disorganized. I would not buy this DVD again and wish I had my money back.

1204141,"Some of the critics dissed the movie by saying ""it's nothing more than two people gazing moonily at each other.""Well, DUH! when the romantic leads know how dangerous it would be to act on their attraction.This whole thing plays in LOOKS. In fact, so much emphasis is placed upon the FACES, that this could have been a silent movie. And probably should have been. Film buffs: Can you imagine the moody atmospheric lighting that a master like F.W. Murnau would have given it? With a fragile innocent like Lillian Gish and an intense guy like Richard Barthelmes in the lead roles? Clarine Seymour would have been the ideal Alice. And the young Sessue Hayakawa would have made a splash as Jacob.As it is, the FACES for this movie are so perfectly chosen, so irresistible that I come back again and again to watch their expressions, that I'm disappointed that the DVD extras did not include a segment on the casting process, who else was in the running for these roles, and why these particular actors made the cut. ""The Wizard of Oz"" and ""Gone With the Wind"" both cover the casting process in depth in their documentaries; why not Twilight? Oh well -- I guess I'll just have to wait for the release of a ""Forever"" edition of the boxed set of all 4 movies.",N/A
113777,"This is a review for the  DVD of the 1949 film WHITE HEAT, starring James Cagney in his comeback gangster role. WHITE HEAT probably raised quite a rukus with the audiences aswell as with ""Official Hollywood"" back in 1949.At that point in his career, it seems that everyone was getting used to the idea that James Cagney just did not want to do gangster roles anymore and here he is at the age of fifty, knocking all those ideas about him , true or not, right on their comfortable cans while he comes roaring out from the screen as shockingly gangsterish,if not downright screwy, as ever before.Cagney sure seems like a human dynamo in this WB classic, not only does he defy society and it's enforcers represented by Edmund O'Brien, he handles his own gang of outlaws like they were harmless kids. The only one who really seems to have the upper hand on Cagney's Cody Jarrett is his mother, who's lap he sits on early in the film.But throughout this film, directed by Raoul Walsh, Cagney's Cody Jarrett runs rampant over everything and everybody who gets in his way. Right up until the end of the film when Cody Jarrett's last line of WHITE HEAT is shouted out probably in both agony and triumph: ""Made it Ma! Top o' the world!""I have been a fan of WHITE HEAT for over fifty years, ever since it was first shown on television. Just about everything in it appealed to me but especially Raoul Walsh's use of industrial sites towards the climax. In my opinion no one has ever done a better job of showing workplace America and how it can be used as a location for an exciting dramatic showdown, especially having the outlaws disguise themselves as ordinary everyday employees.WHITE HEAT was the crown of Raoul Walsh's eleven year, to that point, career at Warner Brothers. Since 1939 Mr. Walsh turned out dynamic pictures such asTHE ROARING TWENTIES, MANPOWER, THE STRAWBERRY BLONDE, THEY DIED WITH THEIR BOOTS ON, THEY DRIVE BY NIGHT, HIGH SIERRA, COLORADO TERRITORY and so many others.But WHITE HEAT, has to be the jewel in the crown of his career, it is one of the most exciting movies of the forties and probably the most iconic picture in the career of the gangster icon. If there is a movie gangster hall of fame, Cody Jarrett holds a special place in it for nerve and energy as well as sheer entertainment value.This is not the kind of revue of WHITE HEAT that I had planned writing butthe energy and excitement of the film have inspired me to try and convey thatsense of verve and nerve to whoever reads this. And if you haven't seen WHITE HEAT,I hope that you're inspired to give it a look, I think it's Cagney and Raoul Walsh at their best.Five fiery stars, full throttle flat out.",N/A

This is quite an interesting situation where he is literally fighting for his life and a couple of times it looks like he definately won't make it.  The ending was a little silly because I don't know why his wife would be hunting him down so late, why didn't she try sooner to contact him.  But I guess that wouldn't have made him the hero in saving her also.  It wasn't a great movie, but it did keep me glued to the screen.",Throttle

And to put this into perspective, when I was a little tike, I grew up with the Jackson Five and idolized MJ myself but I knew others that were popular as well.  The Yellow Submarine, Come On Baby Light My Fire, Bridge Over Troubled Water, It's a Family Affair come to mind along with Ben, ABC, Give Me One More Chance etc (Not necessarily the actual titles but what come to my mind when I think back on those days.Maybe because it was music that was popular with older brothers and sisters or parents but my son again, is crazy about MJ and MJ only!

But this also shows you his technical side or better put, his ""Perfectionist"" side.  Something I didn't realize was how involved he was in every aspect of his performances from the dance moves, to singing, to how the music was played and his influence on making it ""JUST RIGHT"" for the benefit of his fans.We rented this but I am adding it to my list of things to buy.  It's a keeper!  Not only for my three year old but for everyone in this home that loves Michael Jackson and that's all of us.  In my opinion anyone that is a true MJ fan who hasn't viewed this, is doing themselves a great disservice.  This certainly is it!A fitting capture of the legends last performances even if he was just practicing and which displays how remarkably talented he truly was!  (Practice for Michael was like a boxer in a way, he would leave it all in the ring or on the punching bag so to speak meaning, when he practiced, it was like he was performing for the entire world.

754204,"I too was very much looking forward to seeing David Suchet's version of Murder on the Orient Express.  I've never been a big fan of Albert Finney as Poirot.  Suchet's version was disappointing to say the least and doesn't even come close to the award winning Albert Finney version.  I can now understand why authors put clauses in their wills preventing people from carrying on their work.  In this case, somebody came along with a Christian agenda and heavily imposed it on the story line.  Poirot comes across as a cold, self righteous, and judgemental Catholic fanatic.  He is dark and unlikeable.  On top of that the filming comes across as chaotic, featuring choppy cuts and weird angles.  The other actors and actresses in the film were poorly chosen and just don't work well within their roles.  The movie just isn't very enjoyable to watch.I don't think Appointment With Death was as bad as some reviewers have described it, but at the same time it is clearly not one of Suchet's better Poirot films.  The Third Girl is the best of the three movies and is most closely comparable to Suchet's previous work as Poirot.As an unexpected surprise, the set does include a wonderful documentary of David Suchet taking a ride on the Orient Express.  He interviews staff about the train, including its history, and takes the viewer along on every step of his journey (including the meals he ate on board).  It was a real treat to watch.  It's a shame the feature film didn't compare.As an overall assessment, I would only recommend this set for loyal fans who have already purchased all the other Poirot sets (featuring David Suchet).Murder on the Orient Express:  1 star (out of 5)The Third Girl:  3.5 starsAppointment With Death: 3 starsDavid Suchet's Orient Express documentary: 5 stars",N/A
1287207,"This flick is extremely imaginative, although I feel obligated to note that its basic theme has a fair amount in common with ""Alien Nation."" The film is done mostly in documentary form. A huge alien spacecraft comes to rest over Johannesburg, South Africa. Eventually humans board the ship and find about 1 million destitute and starving aliens. Due to their crustacean-looking appearance, they are derogatorily nicknamed ""prawns."" The film revolves around a scenario in which the South African government seeks to relocate the ""prawns"" to a reservation in the South African hinterlands, away from the big city.There is not much in the way of characterization in this film.  Part of this is because the aliens themselves are essentially portrayed mostly as ignorant slum-dwellers who mainly only speak their own language. The poor treatment meted out to the aliens is, unfortunately, all too plausible and this is the real point of this film.This one is worth a try for science fiction aficionados and given its limited budget and lack of big-star cast, it is impressive in its own way.

135545,"Rob Roy is a movie with a few focused characters. You won't find grand battles like in Braveheart here, but they both do take place in Scottland. Robert Roy MacGregor is the hero in this film played by Liam Neeson. Mary Gregor is his wife played by Jessica Lange. He's the leader of his small town and well respected. He see's his people not too well off. So he has a plan of borrowing money from a noble named Montrose. Rob wants to buy cattle for herding and uses some land as calleteral. Montrose agrees and is happy to get a profit for himself whether Rob honors his agreement or fails he wins.Archibald Cunningham played by Tim Roth not only gets in Rob's way of fullfilling his quest to help his town, but destroys many other lives along the way. He's sent by his mother from England to work for Montrose. Another villian more dealing in the shadows than Archibald is Killearn also working for Montrose. Killearn learns of Rob's deal with Montrose and has criminal plans for the borrowed money. Killearn let's Archibald in on the deal. Rob is forced to turn fugitive after the money is lost which Rob has no real evidence to show him who did it.This story is really about showing you how far Rob Roy will go to to protect his people, his family, and his honor. These are not easy things to balance in for him as Archibald and Killearn go after everything he holds of value to him. His wife Mary is really his support when he breaks down a few times through so much going on. She keeps him going on and talks through with him when he can't figure out what to do. Even his honor which his puts above alot of things she admires, but is concerned that it could get him killed.Archibald is one of the top villians that I like. You really can't help but just hate him. His action are only for his own business and pleasure. Whatever happens to anyone that he hurts for that is nothing to him. He's Rob's arch villian in this whole movie. As the movie goes on they come closer and closer to destroying eachother. The last confrontation leads to a great duel. And very different sword skills from both. There are some brief sword and gun battles in here, but this is really a drama. The dialogue and the characters really do make this movie wonderful.",N/A
1212062,"Gomorra (2008) is based on a book from Robert Saviano that touchesupon the  Ndrangheta or Camorra in Naples, Italy. The book receivedmassive acclaim from the Wall St Journal, the Washington Post, theGuardian, riding on the tail of the Brazilian succes of Cidade deDeus (2002) and the favela microcosm.The film's important moment is when the central character, playedby Toni Servillo, suggests that Italy's economy is failing from acompetitiveness point of view in a world global market, from costsattributable to a higher priced currency  (Euro) resulting  in amuch higher cost of living, while the earnings  of the workingclass has either stayed the same,  gotten worse or been made moredifficult, requring more effort and  more work for the same pay, toafford the same staples of health care, food, gas.More to the point, views are asked  on what are the consequences ofunmonitored, laissez faire economics in regards to society,especially in the total absence of morality and fair-play betweenbusinesses.It succeeds in showing a microcosm where people severely lackmental, emotional and  character depth. Viewers are not toldwhether the people are to blame, the lack of local opportunities ina unified Europe and free trade world, or simply the deterioratedquality of life for the working class in Italy overall.It succeeds in showing the human dependency between variousindividuals, a social hierarchy such that extortion payments areenforced from some to others. The author zooms into aspects ofmisery, drug trafficking, unemployment, lookouts and pushers onstreet corners, and rooftops, the childen looking up to gangstersas their role models, unrealistically, a complete lack of anyreligious, or educative instruction in the citizens, admiration forAl Pacino's Tony Montana character, consumption of narcotics, largecash sums exchanged, drug burns, punks and delinquents disturbingthe peace, industrial espionage, alien labor factories bidding onclothes contracts with legitimate fronts, certified garbagedisposal companies hauling toxic and radioactive waste to gardens,small farms, quarries, etc.At least from an artistic point of view, the film is 5%entertainment, 95% esoteric intellectual reflections, meditations,distillation of past events through a biographical filter.First of all, this picture will be worth naught for anyone nothaving resided in Europe, or in a Roman culture in particular(Italy, Sicily, Spain, Portugal, France, etc.)  It shows aglamorless, ghetto, poverty stricken community, for which cityslickers will have a complete lack of rapport, affection orcomprehension.Secondly, the work is too long, lasting well in excess of 2 hours.Some parts are a non sequitur, such as the opening 15 minutes whichpeppered with milquetoast visuals (naked men in a tanning salongetting shot, a scene with one pulling up his pants, anotherrequesting a manicure, or the 2 teens shown in a rice patty fieldspraying bullets from Ak-47 or Uzi's in their plain underwear.)Next, the soundtrack lacks conviction, sophistication andcharacter, existing at most simply to substitute total silence. Thefilming is widescreen, which is a plus, and although crystal clear,fails to show enough of Naples or the countryside to do areality-check, of the beauty of Europe for those loving its citiesand architecture.Instead, it insists in placing horse blinds on viewers, with aone-trick pony zoom of Naple's inner city, its housing projects andpoor in the outskirts of the city, where there is rampantunemployment, poverty, criminality, petty thievery, low-end housingconditions (plumbing, finishing materials) and lack of publicsafety. Nary a single outsider is seen visiting the place (e.g. acop).Fourth, as a form of entertainment, the film struggles in showing asocially redeeming value or humor, not offering a single laughthroughout, as if written straight from a jail cell. This hurts itsreplay potential.Some elements suggest a lack of editing rigor, such as the need toshow a tenant resisting eviction being shot, or 12 year old kidsforced to drive a truck, more alien laborors without basic skillsto function.",Gomorrah

1190709,"It takes extraordinary courage to place a film like BROTHERS before the public, and it is to the credit of director Jim Sheridan that this superb study of the effects of war on everyone around the globe is so fine.  Based on Suzanne Bier's Danish film 'Brdre' concerning the same timeframe in the Afghanistan war, this screenplay was successfully adapted by David Benioff from Anders Thomas Jensen's Danish screenplay. It is delivered in somewhat choppy format, throwing the audience one minute in the US and the next in Afghanistan, and while it does take getting used to, this choice of storytelling ultimately works splendidly, heightening the tension in a very steady unrelenting way.The Cahill family consists of alcoholic, Vietnam Vet father Hank (Sam Shepard), stepmother Elsie (Mare Winningham) and two brothers - 'perfect' athlete and successful USCM Captain Sam (Tobey Maguire) and the recently released from prison 'worthless' Tommy (Jake Gyllenhaal).  Sam is departing for Afghanistan, leaving his wife Grace (Natalie Portman) and two daughters Isabelle and Maggie (child actress par excellence Bailee Madison and Taylor Geare).  Sam entrusts a farewell letter to his best friend Major Cavazos (Clifton Collins Jr.) in case he doesn't return.  Sam is off to war and is very soon shot down and taken prisoner by the Afghanis: the report sent home is that Sam has been killed in action. Sam and Private Joe Willis (Patrick Flueger) are starved, beaten, and abused as prisoners until at one hideous moment Sam is instructed to kill the doomed Joe - an act he carries out and absorbs all the subsequent anguish and guilt that results from his act of survival.At home Grace and Tommy become close: the girls love Tommy, Tommy works on Grace's house, and when the report of Sam's death reaches them they are bonded even more tightly - despite Hank's hateful attitude toward the 'failure' Tommy. But when word reaches them that Sam is alive and when Sam returns home, the trials begin.  Sam is wasted physically and emotionally, forever devastated by his war experience and his guilt.  The story form here on must be seen to understand just how bitterly cruel the aftermath of war can be.This is truly an ensemble movie with every character perfectly cast and giving memorable performances.  Few will be able to erase the images that Tobey Maguire, Jake Gyllenhaal and Natalie Portman create - and hopefully those bleak images will force some reality testing on the ongoing question of the 'worth' of war.

It's rated R mainly because of off color language and some sexual situations, which are hardly graphic.

He's totally clueless on how to care for it.However, from that day forward he is never the same again.Suddenly and unaccountably, everyone he encounters becomes smitten by his puppy, who's the real star in this feature.The themes hinge on lost hope and looking for love and connection in a confusing world.Solo happens to meet a pretty woman who, unexpectedly, is also troubled and lonely.Aside from the language, this is a surprisingly charming and quirky little film involving lost souls who meet a dog that inadvertently leads him to some answers about their plight in life.This is lighthearted fun but not exactly a family or children's movie.The ending is touching and sweet.Dog owners in particular will get a real kick out of this film.",The Dog Problem

This is something that has cropped up here and there , in all of the earlier seasons , except perhaps the first. A good example would be the sudden, unlikely death of U-Turn. In fact, in my opinion, the writing on this show has ALWAYS been a little on the uneven side. The most popular three solutions to problems as they come bearing down on Nancy....the DEA, Nancy f's someone or someone dies...or sometimes all three, as in the case of Peter.I stuck with it this particular season and at times I thought "" cool , they're back, this is going to be great"".  Unfortuneatly, it never really delivered anything solid or even very memorable other than maybe the conclusion.I thought the show was very stale towards the end of the 5th season , again , other than the finale. Going on the run gave the show a real chance to settle, well , anywhere , really. My imagination soared at the concept of the clan somewhere a little different, such as Canada or Seattle. A chance to recapture some of that magic of the first two seasons without the repetitive, overbearing seriousness of her ascent through the higher ranks. Face it, Nancy was at her best when she was still a small fish.I couldn't help but feel that the writers did not have an end game for the 6th season and didn't really expect a 7th season. It seemed everytime they ran out of quick laugh type scenarios...they moved them down the road. Finally, another option other than death, the DEA and/or sex...just move on. I really wonder if this is an option we may need to consider as fans, in order to preserve the memory of a once overwhelmingly fantastic, unique and innovative show.I am starting to look at this show as Weeds : season 1-3, and Weeds Lite: Season 4&5 and now Sorta-Like-Weeds: now with less of a plot and fewer laughs BUT at least the scenary changes",N/A

1295616,"Many of the reviews have stated exactly what went wrong with this film, so I will not repeat them here, but I will say that everything that I adored in the cartoon series is completely gone from the film, and I mean everything. Yes, I realize that many things had to be left out in order to squeeze an entire season into one movie, however, a few SIMPLE things such as character name pronunciation and accurate character representation would have made the film less painful to watch. As a person who occasionally gets teary-eyed during the more emotional sequences of the cartoon series, I felt absolutely no emotion (other than anger) while watching this movie. The actors playing the characters were about as fun to watch as seeing paint dry. I am appalled that a 400-plus minute season of a show could possibly be crammed into a movie that was barely 1 and 1/2 hours. My husband and I were both bored to death while watching this, but we really love the cartoon series, and we are glad that we rented this at Redbox for $1.00, which, as another reviewer stated, is too high a price. The only things that were worth seeing in live action were the costumes (however inaccurate they were), and the sets. Bending was sufficient, but we would have liked to have seen more of it. I would rate this ZERO stars if I could, but the cartoon series is definitely a 5-star in my book.",The Last Airbender

1035529,"""Human Desire"" was adapted to a contemporary setting from Emile Zola's 1890 novel ""La Bete humaine"". Director Fritz Lang represents its human encounters and entanglements as an omnipresent web of criss-crossing train tracks. Jeff Warren (Glenn Ford) has just returned to his old job as a railway engineer after 3 years at war in Korea. Carl Buckley (Broderick Crawford) works in the same rail yard until his violent temper costs him his job. But Carl knows that his wife Vicki (Gloria Grahame) is acquainted with a Mr. Owens, whose influence could get him his job back. Carl begs Vicki to ask Mr. Owens for the favor. She reluctantly consents, but Carl's violent temper rears its ugly head again when he suspects that Vicki traded sexual favors for his job.Carl seems always to push his wife into the arms of other men and then blame her. Vicki is a calculating woman, at the same time victim and femme fatale, who sees no alternative but to try to turn her frustrating circumstances to her advantage. They deadlock when Carl uses a letter that would implicate Vicki in murder to hold her hostage in their marriage, and she retaliates by refusing him any affection. Meanwhile, Vicki has bewitched the one witness who might incriminate her, Jeff Warren, into falling in love with her. Although Jeff is the ""noir protagonist"" in this film, a man caught between his own desires and what's good for him, he is not the strongest character, so his predicament does not drive the film.Vicki and Carl, both unattractive characters, propel the story. Where Carl's inability to conceal or control his anger are his undoing, Vicki's emotions are equally strong but kept bottled, sublimated into her machinations. Beyond the base characterizations of these two villainous types, the way ""Human Desire"" views Vicki is interesting. This film was made in 1954, and it goes out of its way to portray the adulteress in the worst light possible, worse than that of the murderer. Vicki seems to be cast in a harsher light than her actions merit. I put this down to post-war misogyny and fear of sex. Vicki is neither as cunning nor as successful as the femme fatales of the previous decade. She usually just does the obvious, but self-preservation with a sexual twist is enough to condemn her here.",Human Desire (The Human Beast)

1170303,"This 25th Anniversary ""Silver Wedding"" special is a nice little coda to what remains one of the Beeb's best and brightest comedy series.  Peter Spence's TO THE MANOR BORN ran for three series, starring the inestimable Penelope Keith as the staunch Audrey fforbes-Hamilton, a woman who knows her place in the world (the historic Grantleigh Manor and Estate no less), but financial hardships prevent her claim to it!  Millionaire grocery store magnate Richard DeVere (Peter Bowles) snatches up the Estate and earns Audrey's wrath from the get-go with his grand plans of dragging Grantleigh - kicking and screaming if need be - into the hustle of the 1980s.  The final episode of TO THE MANOR BORN (watched by a record-breaking 24 million people during it's original transmission!) saw Audrey win back Grantleigh, and marrying Richard in the bargain.  Which sets the stage for the Silver Wedding special...Whilst preparing for their silver wedding celebrations, there's trouble brewing for Audrey and Richard.  All of their neighbours' estates have been swallowed up by wholesale food company Farmer Tom's (""And what's wrong with wibbly-wobbly carrots?"" quizzes Audrey).  Richard knows exactly what's wrong with them...and the revelation he has for Audrey will send her into a tailspin!  Good old Marjory Frobisher (Angela Thorne) has taken residency of the Lodge - complete with her menagerie of stray animals.  And Audrey welcomes the arrival of nephew Adam (Alexander Armstrong).  Of course the passage of time has also meant the loss of beloved characters Brabinger and Mrs. Poo; however the script includes some nice remembrances of them.Penelope Keith looses little step in re-assuming the character of Audrey.  She's still the glue holding the entire premise together.  And her chemistry with Peter Bowles is as palpable as ever.  Angela Thorne and Gerald Sim (as the Rector) add a nice touch of nostalgia.  Curl up and reunite yourself with the ""Manor"" family...it's every bit as magical as the original series.",To the Manor Born: Silver Anniversary Special

758565,"I had a bit of trouble with my rating because there are several issues I can see using the term ""for beginners"" with this DVD.....Beginners -- well to Pilates? Stability ball? Exercise in general? Depending on what you pick I would give a different answer.Pilates -- I would say Yes  - I own maybe one other Pilates and do not use it, so at least this caught my attention enough not to give it away. I felt the instructions were clear, demonstrated well and easy to follow. I would say a beginner could follow this.Stability ball -- sitting on the fence on this one. I got this because I just don't have many DVD's for the ball and wanted to expand the use of the equipment. That said she is OK on the basic instructions. I think someone who has never used the stability ball could be unstable and would tend to give up.Exercise in general -- No I would not say beginner  - I could see trying to stabilize on the ball and follow the Pilates moves would send the user to the floor more than once.I think this is a nice workout with great moves for toning, flexibility, and breathing techniques.

254983,"Star Trek V has a bad reputation. The criticism of the film has been so harsh that actually watching it might be a pleasant surprise, as long as you're in a charitable mood. Sure, it is definitely the worst of thefirst sixStar Trek movies. But, for the first two-thirds, it's a reasonably interesting adventure, which at least is more than I can say aboutGenerationsandNemesis.The first act isn't bad. Kirk's assault on Paradise City is a competent action scene, and Chekov has a good scene (that doesn't involve him getting hurt, for once) where he tries to distract Sybok by posing as the captain. Sybok is one of the less interesting villains in the series (again, Generations makes him look pretty good), but he shows some charisma in the opening scene, where he converts some guy in the desert.Also, I actually don't mind the goofy humour in the script. I could have done without the more slapstick moments (the one where Scotty hits his head on a bulkhead is just kind of mean), but the scenes on El Capitan and around the campfire are actually surprisingly good. Although McCoy is maybe too much of an angry old man and not enough of a good-natured ironist, at least he's finally hanging out with Kirk and Spock, and gets more dialogue than usual. Kirk's thoughts on dying alone are truly affecting (Shatner makes the lines sound like the product of genuine reflection), and underscore the friendship that forms the biggest theme of the original series. The small bits with Chekov and Sulu getting lost, and Uhura bringing Scotty dinner, are also quite nice. Not every Star Trek story has to be serious, sometimes it's okay to have a light-hearted adventure while showing the characters being comfortable in their decades-long interactions.The second act, where Kirk, Spock and McCoy evade Sybok aboard the Enterprise, is also pretty good. I'm not fond of the big revelation about Sybok's relation to Spock -- it's one of those huge plot twists that have never been so much as suggested in the entire history of Star Trek up to this moment, then are totally forgotten as soon as they serve their purpose in the movie. It would have accomplished the same thing if they had just been childhood friends, or something. But the scene where Sybok uses his method on Spock and McCoy is excellent. DeForest Kelley gives the best performance of all his years of playing McCoy, convincingly showing how his character felt helpless and never forgave himself for not being able to cure his father's illness. Shatner provides the perfect counterpoint to the scene, when Kirk refuses to play by Sybok's rules and snarls that he refuses to reveal his ""pain."" It is very appropriate to Kirk's character.Unfortunately, the third act is terribly bad. Not only does the movie completely forget about the whole Paradise City subplot, but the resolution of Sybok's mystical quest is unbelievably dumb. Imagine ifThe Motion Picturehad ended with a gunfight against giant robots, and you have something like the ending of The Final Frontier. Allegedly, Paramount stiffed Shatner on the special effects money, but it's not their fault. Sadly, the blame belongs entirely withShatner, who couldn't think of a better ending for his own story. And it's not that hard to think of one. For example, it would have been much better to do something likethat one episodeof Next Generation where Picard discovers a secret message from the earliest humanoids -- that would have conveyed all the stuff about how god exists inside every person, without the lame action sequence. It would also have made more sense than bringing in the Klingonsyet againand making it so that absolutely everyone in the entire crew somehow doesn't notice them decloaking.The problem with the movie is that it goes through a bunch of reasonably good ideas, uses each one only long enough for one plot point, and then discards it. Like how the Paradise City planet and the diplomats are forgotten after the first act (if you're giving David Warner a supporting role, you really ought to give him something to work with), or how Sybok is unceremoniously shoved out of the picture during the conclusion, or how Spock and McCoy accompany Kirk to the planet only to make comments and get beamed out. None of the supporting characters really feels that important to the plot -- they all feel arbitrary, like Shatner is just making up the story as he goes along. Which he probably did.It is a very muddled movie. If you don't like Star Trek, it will confirm your views. But, if you're familiar with the characters, it's watchable and occasionally even good. You do have to lower your expectations a bit, though.",N/A

508258,"A beautiful and distracted woman named Giuliana (Monica Vitti) wanders aimlessly through the grimy perimeter streets outside a power generation plant amidst the intermittent chaos of a workers' strike, accompanied by her young son Valerio (Valerio Bartoleschi). Observing one of the striking workers eating his lunch, she instinctually begins to feel hungry, approaches him, and offers to buy the half-eaten sandwich from the bewildered stranger. After voraciously finishing her meal in a secluded area, she pays an unexpected visit to her husband Ugo (Carlo Chionetti), the manager of the power generation plant, who is preoccupied with assisting an engineer named Corrado Zeller (Richard Harris) in finding specialized workers for an international industrial project. In Giuliana's absence, Ugo expresses his concern to Corrado of his wife's erratic behavior that seems to have manifested as a result of a car accident. Corrado is captivated by the sensitive and enigmatic Giuliana, and begins to accompany her as she goes through the empty rituals of a ""normal"" life: planning the interior decoration of an unspecified shop that she has decided to establish in a near desolate street; visiting the wife of a potential employee for Corrado's project; wandering through a power line construction site; meeting Ugo and some friends at a neglected fishing cottage for a meaningless liaison. However, her fleeting connection to the emotionally inscrutable Corrado is soon tested when Giuliana's overwhelming anxiety resurfaces after Valerio feigns a crippling illness during Ugo's absence from home.Marking Michelangelo Antonioni's entry into color film, Red Desert is a visually dense, metaphoric, and emotionally austere portrait of spiritual desolation, technological disconnection, and environmental malaise. Exploring similar themes of estrangement and ennui as his seminal trilogy of alienation (L'Avventura, La Notte, and L'Eclisse), Antonioni's color palette juxtaposes muted earth tones and bold, artificial (and often primary) colors to reflect the unnaturality and inherent competition between natural order and industrialization in a modern, and increasingly alienated, society: the automated rhythm of toxic, yellow fume emissions from the plant as Giuliana and Valerio pass nearby that bookend the film; the brightly painted, color-coded pipes that populate the interior spaces of the control facility as Giuliana pays a visit to the emotionally distant Ugo; the bright red, high power antennas that visually bisect the landscape during Giuliana and Corrado's walk (note Theo Angelopoulos' homage to Antonioni through a similarly framed horizon shot of telephone line technicians in The Suspended Step of the Stork). Antonioni further manifests the encroachment and toll of industrialization through disquieting ambient noise (modulated high frequency sounds and monotonous drone), bleak and polluted landscapes (the blackened desolate area where Giuliana consumes her appropriated sandwich and the fishing ban on the waters surrounding the disused shack), and the intrusion of man-made objects into the frame (the repeated image of ships traversing the horizon). Inevitably, the seeming cure to Giuliana's indefinable illness proves to be a resigned acceptance and emotional immunity to the irreconcilable chaos of her dehumanized and alienating environment.",N/A
512407,"Herschell Gordon Lewis made Horror history with 1963's BLOOD FEAST, widely considered to be the first ""gore"" film. In the years before the MPAA, filmmakers were only limited from showing excessive nudity on-screen. With no rules preventing anyone in the movie industry from depicting gratuitous violence or horrifying bodily dismemberment, H.G. Lewis and business partner David F. Friedman embarked on a series of films that exploited these loose regulations in an attempt to compete with the major studio releases in the drive-in circuit. The two did not ease in to this newly established genre with just a few missing limbs or a severed head, but (literally) covered the screen in blood and butchery from start to finish. This simply had never been done before, and even to this day, BLOOD FEAST continues to serve as one of the most shocking and gruesome films in the genre.Mrs. Fremont is throwing a dinner party for her daughter's engagement, so in order to impress her guests, she has hired the exotic caterer Fuad Ramses to put on an extravagant feast! What she doesn't know is that Fuad has worked up a special menu made from bits and pieces of the missing girls from around town, which he will be serving as the main course in an Egyptian blood feast to appease the goddess Ishtar!PSYCHO, this is not; Lewis' listless direction shows all of the style and finesse of an early stag film (another genre with which he was fondly familiar). BLOOD FEAST tastefully implies nothing, and instead plasters the screen in one lurid image after another, using as few camera set-ups and shots as possible for the minimal amount of coverage provided. Lewis and Friedman would tap Playboy playmate Connie Mason to star as the beautiful young bride-to-be, who would return for their follow-up 2000 MANIACS the next year. Mason, along with her fellow cast members, produce truly horrible performances, but the roles are so poorly acted and outrageously over-the-top that they give way to the highest level of camp. As if the subject matter was not forward enough, Lewis' editing clearly demonstrates his lack of concern with plotting or characterization, as the camera holds on the disfigured remains of Fuad's victims much longer than it ever does for any of the characters in the film.Using gallons of red paint and nearly an entire butcher's shop of animal entrails, BLOOD FEAST offers everything from a beach full of splattered brains, to a torn out tongue, a hacked off leg, and more in eye-popping color film stock! While this may not seem like much, the method in which the murders are filmed and the absolutely absurd amount of bright-red blood make these moments as memorable as they are completely revolting.Herschell Gordon Lewis, the ""Godfather of Gore,"" has left behind a bloody trail of influence in the wake of this seminal shocker. BLOOD FEAST has had a profound effect on countless young filmmakers, and will continue to live on in the annals of Horror for many years to come.-Carl ManesI Like Horror Movies",Blood Feast VHS
68103,"I'll admit, I kept my expectations low when I saw this, since I was aware it was a direct-to-video sequel.  But I found the ending of the original ""Dragonheart"" quite depressing, so I wanted to check this one out anyway.  I actually ended up liking it quite a bit!  This is definitely aimed at a younger audience (in the bonus features, the producer even said that she wanted to do a sequel aimed at a younger audience - and she's the same producer from the original ""Dragonheart""), but I think even some adults will find it entertaining.  It's a good, family-friendly movie, and it does have a much happier ending than the first.  I thought that Drake was actually pretty well rendered, and the costuming and set seemed pretty authentic for a direct to video movie.  Also, the choreography was quite well done in the fighting sequences.  And the scene where Drake is learning how to breathe fire is a riot!  So, taken for what it is, a family-friendly ""boy and his dragon"" story, with themes of friendship and loyalty, I think it's really quite a good movie.  Let's just say I've seen a lot worse.

I was excited when I heard about this production because Andrew Davies always writes very strong screenplays and I always like and admire his work.  This was another fantastic screenplay and production.The story follows the lives of one family the Dashwoods.  Mrs. Dashwood's husband dies and all of his property and possessions goes to his only son from a previous marriage.  This leaves his three daughters and wife with really nothing.  The son wants to help his step-mother and sisters but his pernicious wife Fanny Dashwood quickly is able to talk him out of helping them.  From here the family is able to find a small cottage with a distant relative of Mrs. Dashwood.  At the heart of the story is Elinor Dashwood, the oldest and most responsible and level-headed character in the story.  She takes on most of the responsibility of seeing to the family's needs, she is very practical and is able to manage the family well.  When she meets Fanny Dashwood's eldest brother Edward Ferrars, they develop a deep attachment towards each other that Fanny tries and prevent.  Unfortunately, Edward never promises Elinor marriage or really speaks of his feelings for her because he is secretly engaged to another woman.  In contrast to Elinor, her sister Marianne is very impulsive, romantic and lets everyone see her real feelings.  Marianne and her family meet a friend of their cousin Colonel Brandon, who falls in love with Marianne despite the age difference.  Marianne does not love him but eventually falls in deep love with the dashing Willoughby.All of the important characters that were missing in the first version were in this one. Hattie Morahan is absolutely perfect as Elinor.  I always felt that Elinor was the center of the story and Hattie Morahan really hits the part well.  When I read the book I imagined someone exactly like her in this role.  I also really liked Dan Stevens as Edward Ferrars and I thought he portrayed the part well.  I especially liked Charity Wakefield as Marianne, I thought she captured the spirit and romantic nature of the character.  Her innocence sparkles.  Another great feature of this one is the scenery and locations picked in this production, they are wonderful.  I especially love the Dashwood's cottage, it really is a romantic wild place with the waves crushing onto the steep hills.  This movie is worth watching just for Adrew Davies screenplay.

The film's time trajectory is over a period of weeks and months and only culminates with a Christmas feast.  There is so much said about dysfunctional or disconnected families but there are no alike families in the world.  Each family has it's own unique dynamic and the Goodes as portrayed here are no exception.  Frank Goode (Robert De Niro) recently retired and widowed is looking to gather his four adult children at his home.  Each concoct an excuse not to come.  Since the kids won't come to Frank he'll go to them even though they live on all corners of the U.S.A.  There is an apparent disconnect between Frank and the kids even though by all accounts he was a hard-working and loving provider for his wife and kids.  It just seems that Frank's traditional role was as bread-winner and his wife provided the psychic nurturing.  With her passing there is a definite void in the family and Frank's journey becomes both physical and one of self-discovery.  The cast here is uniformly great but it's De Niro's show.  In a subtle yet no less masterful turn De Niro demonstrates the evolution Frank makes.  Director-writer Kirk Jones script is no less knowing and insightful.

The main problem lies in Marshall and writers Michael Tolkin and Anthony Minghella's mistakes in handling the material as a musical.In Marshall's ""Chicago,"" the musical numbers were presented as the ""fantasies"" of Roxie Hart's vaudeville-obsessed dreams, and the conceit worked really well--- for THAT film and THAT musical. Unfortunately, the same musical numbers-as-fantasy device is employed here, and it simply doesn't work with this show.  ""Chicago"" is presented on stage as ""a musical vaudeville,"" in which the musical numbers exist in a deliberately ""staged"" form. The fantasy makes sense in the context of Roxie's dreams. Not so in ""Nine,"" where the musical numbers just exist organically within the drama, whether in flashback or in the present. In the film ""Nine,"" each number is presented as a fantasy--but why? The protagonist, flailing film director Guido Contini (Day-Lewis), has no reason to have ""musical"" fantasies--he's a film director.This makes the film ""Nine"" less a musical, than a ""musical,"" in which the songs are not to be taken literally. It's as though Marshall feared audiences would not believe that the characters simply sing because they just DO, but felt the need to make it easier to accept by making the songs ""dream sequences."" Does not work at all--it undermines the drama of the story by abruptly shifting the tone, while also making it lose its integrity as a musical. It's a shame, too, because there is so much talent in this film. This would have worked a WHOLE lot better if more songs were retained and this was just presented as it is on stage--in which the characters sing, not because it's fantasy, but because it's a MUSICAL.",N/A

259749,"""I listened to my own story, and brought in my own verdict."" -- Robert Young to Jane GreerThis neglected masterpiece is every bit as deserving of the praise reserved for only the finest of films in the noir drama genre. Rarely has the true nature of a heel been so clearly defined as in this RKO classic starring Robert Young a a shallow cad who can't seem to help himself. And never has one man of less moral character deserved any less the love and devotion of three women. Jane Greer, Susan Hayward, and Rita Johnson are splendid as those women in director Inrving Pichel's riveting, flashback laden and twisted tale which begins and ends at a murder trial. Enhanced by another fine score from RKO's Roy Webb, lush photography from Harry Wild, and a fine adaptation of Gordon McDonnell's story by screenwriter Jonathan Latimer, this film grabs you from the opening moments and just won't let go. Produced by Joan Harrison, more surprises await the unsuspecting viewer than in an entire case of Cracker Jacks.Verna Carlson (Susan Hayward) is dead as the film begins, and Lawrence Ballentine (Robert Young) is on trial for her murder. All the evidence has been presented, and it doesn't look good at all for Ballentine. His only hope rests with his own testimony, and when his attorney puts him on the stand to tell his story, we are frozen to our seats listening to the tale of arguably the biggest heel in film history. Pichel uses flashbacks as Ballentine tells a story both sordid and mesmerizing. The more he says, the more viewers are left wondering how it ended in murder, if indeed it did, and later, just who was murdered. So twisted is this story of love and crime you'd have to actually try to spoil it for someone to do so, and even then you might not succeed. Ballentine shows himself to be, through his own testimony, a morally deficient man who married his wife Greta (Rita Johnson) for her money. Lovely Jane Greer, before Howard Hughes tried to ruin her career, is Ballentine's first affair, Janis. But she's no Saturday afternoon girl, just a sweet and lonely one who makes the mistake of falling in love with Larry.But while Larry may have married for money, his wife Greta did not, loving very much her husband, though aware he is weak. Johnson is wonderful here, as a wife who can't stop trying to make things work because her marriage is everything to her. It makes Larry's behavior, and the attitude he displays about her to other women, even more despicable. Moving him around as quickly as her money will afford, however, can't improve his character or lessen his weaknesses, and soon he's left a brokenhearted Janis only to take up with secretary Verna Carlson (Susan Hayward). Perhaps due in part to the influence of female producer Joan Harrison, all the women here, even the somewhat trampy Verna, prove to have more character, with all of them driven by love. It is that love, so undeserved, which makes the story Larry is telling the jurors so repugnant. We learn how Verna died, but that's only the beginning of this sickening but can't-stop-watching look at a true heel.A car accident, a suicide, and a shallow cad who only realizes how ugly he's been while telling all on the witness stand can't begin to describe the twists and turns here. Every time something new is revealed, you think you've got a handle on things, then a hairpin curve nearly causes you to crash in flames, and you keep watching. Beautifully shot by Harry Wild, especially the scenes of the ranch in Tulare County with the waterfall, the story does the rest. Hayward is excellent here, eliciting sympathy as a trampy girl who finally plays it straight, but with the wrong guy. Greer is also terrific in a role which counterbalances her darker turn in Out of the Past this same year. Rita Johnson is quite wonderful as well, playing the part of a sweet wife so well we want to throttle Larry ourselves, even if he is found innocent, which is none too clear. Fantastic and much underrated is this marvelous film that deserves a major dvd release. This is a region two DVD, but it can be found on VHS for NTSC region one in the old gold and black box, with a good print. A must have film for all classic film fans.",N/A
1286455,"I can understand why this film failed to impress some viewers - it's a low-budget gay indie film, the performances aren't particularly memorable and there isn't much of a plot.  Yet for me the film had a special quality - there's just something about the way the story is told that I found really touching and poignant.Rusty is a successful architect who specializes in restoring period homes.  He's incredibly handsome - with a buff, chunky, muscular body, expressive dark brown eyes, and soft, wavy hair. The film makes full use of all this - Rusty is shown in varying degrees of undress for much of the film. Rusty's boyfriend, Daniel, is another successful type, and, Rusty, with his model-like beauty and career, really does seem a ""lucky bastard"".When Daniel goes on a business trip, Rusty meets Denny, a brash, HIV-positive crystal meth addict with a mysterious past.  The attraction between them is instant and electric, and the two begin a passionate affair.  Up until then, Rusty had led a play-it-safe, decent, fairly conventional life, but somehow feels drawn towards Denny's dark world of drugs, sex, pleasure and living for the moment in the L.A. underground scene.Rusty is intrigued by this new lifestyle, but at the same time recoils from it. The film explores this internal contradiction many of us, and certainly I, have experienced - we are thrilled about drifting outside our comfort zone, and the sense of danger and excitement that brings, yet feel anchored by the stability and 'safeness' of our usual lives.The film has a beautiful, fluid texture to it as Rusty's encounter with a very different person leads him to re-evaluate his life and goals.  For me there were some wonderful moments - the evocative scene where Rusty and Denny embrace on an L.A. street with the Hollywood Hills and the Hollywood Sign in the distant background, and Denny's monologue about how he came to be a crystal meth addict.Watch the deleted scenes in the DVD - they're good and I can't imagine why the one where Rusty and Denny share their coming out stories didn't make into the movie proper.",Lucky Bastard
61450,"The lame old joke goes that you watch this movie for two reasons - both well in evidence in the box cover reproduced here, right above Frank Whaley's head.  For some reason I own this John Hughes-written, Bryan Gordon-directed flick, but I'd never watched it all the way through.  I remember when it came out on video, working in the video store and having a Connelly-crazed coworker who had to put it on all the time, and getting so irritated by the soundtrack and the just plain stupid music-video feel of the thing that I vowed I'd never watch it straight through - despite my own attraction to Ms. Connelly's...uhh...talents.Well, it's not actually as bad as I feared.  Bad, yes - particularly the beginning 20 minutes and a similar chunk at the ending.  I don't know if it's Frank Whaley's Jim Dodge character that is incredibly annoying, or Whaley himself, and I don't know if Hughes wanted him to seem AS annoying as he is - probably not.  He's a 21-year-old compulsive liar always talking himself up who still lives at home in a small town somewhere near St. Louis who ends up in a night clean-up job at Target - after being fired from innumerable other positions.  One thing I found particularly irritating was that the guy seems to belong to a completely different family than the one he is actually a part of - his speech, his intellectual pretensions, just don't jibe.  Not that such things don't happen, but it's played entirely for laughs here and is never remotely convincing.The humor, in fact - this is supposed to be a ""comedy"" after all - is what doesn't work, and surprisingly what really does succeed is the sentimental element that comes into place when Dodge finds that Connelly's rich-girl character Josie McClellan is locked in with him, and starts to bond with her over their mutual dissatisfactions with life.  Here in the central part of the film we get to see Jim's egotistical bluster fade away and Josie starts to appear as something more than an object of desire.  And the dialogue about hopes and aspirations here is actually some of Hughes' better work I think - both Whaley and Connelly seem more natural and at ease during this section, and for a few moments the film starts to approach the kind of feeling that we find in THE BREAKFAST CLUB.Alas it doesn't stay on that level for long, and a subplot about a couple of incompetent (yet supposedly vicious) criminals (Dermot and Kieran Mulroney) that break into the store and threaten the kids is played entirely for broad laughs, and very poorly at that.  And Connelly's many cleavage shots and the infamous scene of her riding a coin-op horse really get to be obnoxious and borderline offensive by the end - which is entierly predictable if even more poorly staged than I would have guessed.If you're  watching this because of fantasies about the young Jennifer Connelly then - well, I guess it might be worth it.  And if  you find the typical John Hughes adolescent/young male arrogance and snottiness - think of Jim Dodge as a just slightly older Ferris Bueller from the sticks - more bearable than I do, you'll probably like this.  Even Connelly can't quite redeem this for someone like me who isn't crazy about John Hughes' take on youth and comedy, but at least it's short, and it does have it's moments.",N/A

Also appropriate,would be to read ""True History of the Kelly Gabg"" by Peter Carey,which I reviewed on June 24,2009.There is so much to cover in this piece of history,that the movie has to move quickly to cover the story.Some have criticized the choice of Jagger for the main role;but I think he did an excellent job.He did not appear for only short periods,but was in virtually every scene.I was also impressed with the photography and felt that it, along with the music,was outstanding.Of course,as with any piece of history,there can be endless arguments about how factually accurate every last detail is;but if one can get past nitpicking;this movie is excellent.",N/A
1273559,"Okay, another vampire film ... again. And another attempt at a comedy-horror film ... again. And critics were mixed on whether this was worth your time or simply mediocre. Well, to be honest, going in expecting just an average film at best actually made me come out saying ""that film was great"" and for all the good reasons!!!This is an English film which at times follows the same line as Shaun of the Dead but instead of zombies our antagonists are vampires (or more correctly, lesbian vampires). The stars are two blokes, one who just broke up with his girlfriend and another who wishes he had a girlfriend. With the sadness that comes from being dumped, our hero decides they should take a trip hiking just to get away and clear his head, so they randomly pick a place out in the rural section of England. Unbeknownst to our heroes they land up in a village cursed by an ancient vampiress Camilla (see LeFanu's novella) where all woman who turn 18 become walkers of the dead. At the same time our heroes arrive, a group of college co-eds are in the town to write a paper on the folklore around Camilla and her ""legacy"". So begins a film of many things: a sex comedy, a gothic horror film, a British slapstick movie, and a gore fest, and to a lesser extent, an exploitation film. One would think that a film with lesbian vampires would be no more than exploitation but oddly it is not. Marketing of the film played on this but the film makers only followed the lead while mostly keeping it in the background as they followed the other paths that this film could follow.I must admit this film was good in every way. First off, the film makers really got a great gothic and horror feel to it that you'd have seen in the old Universal horror films or the old Hammer horror films. The film is pure atmosphere. Second, the comedy works and it works well. There is the juvenile moments (see sword and sword handle) but you'll be laughing out loud. With the character of the vicar playing the film straight, the movie truly worked as British comedies do. Third, not once was I at a point that I felt I should shut off the film and do something else. I was engrossed throughout. To conclude, the film was just plain good fun.For eye candy, the blood and boobs crowd will be delighted. It has absolutely beautiful women throughout and dressed in revealing if not fully revealing outfits. And the gore is everywhere. Many deaths and they are done quite well with excellent special effects.  The whole film is obviously tongue in cheek so the violence is supposed to be a bit over the top. The music is mostly orchestral so you don't get the annoying soundtracks that you would in most films like this.  I'd go in watching this film with an open mind, ignoring what the critics have mostly said. You'll come out delighted since it is a fun wild ride of entertainment and truly a good hour and a half of a flick. Enjoy.",N/A
1153126,"Naruto the Movie 2: Legend of the Stone of Gelel is the second theatrical film in the Naruto franchise.  When watching the film, it was obvious a lot of effort went into rendering the backgrounds.  However, the animation of the characters was not as strong as in the first film.  Shikamaru and Kankuro both received consistently bad animation.  The animation for Sakura would fluctuate being rather good to being very poor.  While Naruto tended to get good animation, there were sections where he would occasionally get some bad animation.  Gaara and the new characters all seemed to get consistently good animation.When Legend of the Stone of Gelel was released on DVD, it was released as a two-disc set.  The first disc contained the film, while the second disc had all the special features.  For set up, there is a section to choose audio and subtitle options.  For audio, there is supposed to be English 5.1, English Stereo, Japanese 5.1, and Japanese Stereo.  However, if you select Japanese Stereo, it plays the English Stereo audio instead.  The only way to hear the Japanese audio on this release is to select Japanese 5.1.  There is also a section where you can turn on the audio commentary and to turn on the Pop-Up Naruto Guides.The second disc contains seven extras.  The first is a fourteen-and-a-half minute long documentary called, ""Creating the World of Naruto the Movie 2.""  Over the course of this documentary, various people involved with the production (the Production Supervisor, a Co-Producer, the ADR Producer, the ADR Director, and the Associate Producer), as well as the English voices for Sakura, Naruto, Haido, Gaara, Shikamaru, Kankuro, Temujin, Kahiko, Fugai, and Ranke are interviewed.The second feature is a twenty-two minute documentary titled, ""Write amd Adapt like a Ninja.""  Everyone from the first documentary, as well as a few additional staff members, talk about the steps that take place to produce the English dub of the film.  They talk about the direct translation script, script adaptation, and the voice acting stage.  The bulk of the documentary focuses on the voice acting.The third feature is ""Words From Japan.""  This is an eight-minute interview with the Japanese Director and Character Designer.  This feature is in Japanese with English subtitles, and has occasional scenes from the film in English edited into it.  The fourth feature is a production art gallery, which is eighteen pages of line art of the new characters introduced in the film.  The fifth feature is labeled as ""Original Storyboards.""  This is done as a thirty-one minute slideshow, where each page of storyboard is only up for a couple of seconds before moving on to the next one.  You really don't have time to make out what it is you're seeing before the slideshow moves on.The sixth feature is ""Original Japanese Movie Trailers.""  They are all in Japanese, but there are no subtitles.  This feature, which is all one chapter, runs for about eight minutes and contains eighteen trailers in all.  Some of the trailers are so similar to each other, that you swear that someone made a mistake and put the same trailer in several times in a row.  The final feature is the English trailer for the third Naruto film, Guardians of the Crescent Moon Kingdom.Even with its faults, this movie needs to be in the DVD collection of anyone who considers themselves a fan of Naruto.In order to write this review, I checked out a copy of this DVD through the King County Library System.",Naruto The Movie 2:Legend of Stone (DVD)

1334750,"First let me say I am a major fan of disaster movies; they are armchair adventures for me and I watch a lot of them. This movie, for plot, acting or special effects in no way comes even close to matching 2012, the major movie release of last year.  This particular movie is made on a very small budget; if you have watched any of the disaster movies shown on the SYFY channel, you have a good idea what you are in for here. There are computer generated special effects, some pretty good, some pretty obvious, such as the subzero blizzard in the tropics that doesn't seem to bother the plants at all or make the actors appear to be particularly cold in their tropical clothing. On the plus side, the movie was largely filmed in Belize using at least some footage of a Mayan temple, which helps a bit there.  The basic plot of the movie has various people attempting to get to a Mexican Mayan pyramid by Dec. 21st in order to fulfill a Mayan/Christian prophecy.  There are some major holes in the logic of the film, such as why the Mayans would incorporate Christianity into the design of a pyramid long before the arrival of the Spanish,  but NOT incorporate it into their lives and culture. The movie is produced by a company called Faith Films which explains why,  several times in it's approximately 80 minute running time,  it seems to grind to a halt to deliver a mini-sermon. Most of the action takes place in out of the way locations and involves a small number of people; considering the world is threatened with total destruction,  I am not sure where the rest of us are and why we don't seem to care; are we all hiding in our basements?

1209444,"The story goes that whenToy Storywas first envisioned, it was as Yet Another of their award winning animated shorts until somewhere along in the process someone got the bright idea of turning it into Pixar's first feature.The rest, as they say, is history.  If something similar was going on with this movie, and I suspect that it was, it is proof that longer is not always better, not even from Pixar.  They took the potential Best Animated Short EVER and turned it into a so-so 90-minute movie.The beginning is animation and movie making at its best; the short scene depicting a lifetime of marriage with nary a word spoken may be the most emotionally moving piece of animation ever created; and the scene where the house takes flight is, figuratively and literally, the high point of the movie.  A short coda, say showing future explorers finally reaching the top of the falls and finding the house impossibly but successfully perched there, would have finished off a stunning animated short.  Pixar chose to continue on, unwisely IMHO, because once you've reached the high point the only way to go is down.The first descent was to turn this movie into Yet Another story of an irascible old man coping with a child who fails to grasp that he isn't really wanted, hardly the most original idea, though setting it in a floating house provides some novelty.  Will a persistentDennisfinally melt Mr. Wilson's icy heart?...  Uh, that is, will a persistent Russell finally melt Mr. Fredericksen's icy heart?  Especially with the added poignancy of Russell's quixotic motive: winning back the love and attention of a father lost through divorce?Do you really have to ask?The second descent was to blow away any remaining realism by introducing talking dogs and a gigantic reject from the cast of Pixar's academy-award-winning shortFor the Birds.  This produces lots of funny jokes, but at the expense of any remaining plausibility,...and causes serious problems for the third descent: the return of a forgotten character as an embitteredCaptain Nemo, a mad genius turned killer because the world has wronged him.  This mixture of darkness and light, grimness and whimsy, simply fails to work at all, not least because the villain ought to be over a hundred years old by now.Finally, this movie gets an ""F"" for its understanding of the problems ofCryptozoology.  As a practical matter, in order to protect a rare and endangered animal you first have to prove that it exists, and that ultimately requires a specimen.  If you can bring it in alive, so much the better, but bring it in you must.  As one by no means heartless or cruel scientist investigating Bigfoot put it, we need a body.  The first hunter to bring in a Bigfoot should be given a medal; the second hunter to bring in a Bigfoot should be SKINNED.  Now, it is perfectly understandable that people would be squeamish about this idea when we are talking about, at the very least, aman-like creature, what Edgar Rice Burroughs would call ananthropoid ape, but it is sheer idiocy to take this attitude about a giant bird that in real life would have been following Russell and Mr. Fredericksen...in order to kill and eat them.",N/A
310104,"Let me set the record straight, once and for all. Only George Lazenby could have made this movie work! I'm so sick and tired of reading reviews from critics about how Sean Connery would have made this movie better. Lazenby has usually gotten the short end of the stick, because he had the misfortune of being the first man to succeed Connery in the role of James Bond. Comparisons between the two were inevitable. Critics have been quick to point out how Lazenby lacked the movie star presence and charisma of his predecessor. I can point out to them that that's the same problem that all of Connery's successors have had. I would suggest to these so-called movie experts to compare Lazenby to his successors, not his predecessor. I think of him as a cross between Roger Moore and Timothy Dalton. He combines the strengths of both and the weaknesses of neither. Lazenby can play both the comic and serious tones of the movie very well, and can make transitions between the two seamlessly. He also brings a down to earth quality to the Bond character that make his desire to fall in love and settle down more believable than it would have been if Connery had done it. It also strengthens the danger situations, because he's not the larger than life hero that Sean Connery was. What the critics took for a weakness, is actually his strength. Lazenby managed to do what no other actor who played Bond (including Connery) was able to do until Daniel Craig took over the role. He made James Bond human.  And a human James Bond is what was needed to make this movie work, and it does, beautifully. The rest of the movie pretty much speaks for itself:great leading lady, great directing, great supporting cast, etc. The action, the laughs, and the drama are all there in one of the top five great Bond movies of all time.",N/A
972845,"After the vast success of ""Three Extremes"" three other Asian horror savants (South Korea's Kim Je-Woon, Thailand's Nonzee Nimibutr, China's Peter Chan) stepped up to the plate to deliver us a successor.The original had three tales of distinct horror methods--one of gross-outs, one of violence, and one of psychological maiming. ""Three Extremes II"" however, seems to have a common theme about all three which is the voyage of the afterlife.Due to atmospheric and thematic similarities I found the stories a little less engaging when viewed back-to-back. Perhaps this could've been that the first two films of the movie (the first especially) were rather uneventful.Starting chronologically, the short ""Memories"" by Kim Je-Woon is South Korea's entry into the anthology. It starts with promise as it shows a man presumably sleeping on a couch and very gradually pans closer and closer to him. Then it shows us more of the room he is in, and immediately Je-Woon strikes a nerve of undeniable creepiness with a huddled women rocking to and from in a corner. This sense of uneasiness quickly dissolves as the story progresses. Nothing really happens throughout. Like I said above it was uneventful--sure people are talking (though there's an odd lack of dialogue in ""Memories""), sure they're walking and driving around trying to discover a mystery, but it's a mystery most viewers have probably solved. There's also a woman who seems to have lost her memory, but almost immediately I put two-and-two together and figured out her connection with our main character. Je-Woon uses rather cheap shock-tactics like sudden movements and sharp music to make us jump. Its unfortunate Kim Je-Woon's entry was so weak narrative-wise and predictable story-wise, because he is the director of one of my favorite movies ever ""A Tale of Two Sisters"". I went in hoping for something exquisite from him but got a rather generic story. I do not dislike the movie, because it does have its pluses like solid acting, beautiful camerawork, and the cutest child you'll ever see in any movie, but I cannot say I liked it either because there was so little story. All-in-all, Kim Je-Woon's ""Memories"" is forgettable, shiny, and predictable--nothing more than you'd expect from one of Hollywood's J-horror remakes.The middle segment on the disc is one of Thai origins called ""The Wheel"" from director Nonzee Nimibutr. Being only briefly acquainted with Thai horror, I found myself excited to see what Thailand had to offer. Many reviews claim this to be the flimsiest entry, but I have to disagree. I think most of ""The Wheel"" was lost in translation because it is a piece so close to Thailand. It's a cultural short involving Thai beliefs that we North American viewers simply cannot grasp--or at least not appreciate fully. That being said, I personally loved the cultural experience of watching ""The Wheel"" and felt almost like it was a documentary of rural Thailand. The set design is beautiful and exotic; the costumes and puppets are breath-taking and unique; the entire piece rings with foreign flavor, and was a nice contrast to ""Memories"" which could've been copied and pasted into any country's film. That being said, while it dealt with horror (spirits, possession and vengeance) it didn't feel like a full-feldged horror. The very opening is chilling but like ""Memories"" it fades to black rather quickly. Unlike ""Memories"" I found myself interested by the foreign aspect and the beauty of the setting, from the murky lagoon to the unique houses to the vibrant costumes. The acting throughout is rocky--there's a few actors who deliver questionable performances, and that is probably my biggest qualm with the film. Aside from that it had a very redeeming ending, and in more ways than one.The closing piece is absolutely and without question my favorite of the three, and probably my favorite out of the original three as well. I think the DVD editors placing Peter Chan's ""Going Home"" last was strategy, as they started with the most feeble and the ""Going Home"" segment is powerful enough to make you forget about ""Memories""'s weakness and leaves you with a very positive feeling after watching. Had they reversed the order, the haunting touch of ""Going Home"" wouldn't have survived through the end of ""Memories"" and my review would be two starts instead of three. That may sound ridiculous but it's all too true. The story starts with a single father and his son who are moving into a new complex, one that looks decrepit and neglected. This dirty setting is awesome for capturing what will happen later. Chan's direction then switches from the father-son relationship and to a much more aberrant relationship concerning a rather shoddy character we're introduced to through the young son and a wife who is seemingly long-dead. This is a ghastly, provocative, touching story of requited love and the testing of lengths one will go through for that love. I will not delve any further into the story--discover this gem on your own. If anything this DVD is worth the $15 for this piece alone--I wish it could've been a feature length film.Overall, ""Three Extremes II"" doesn't succeed as horror but are an excellent trio of chilling dramas. It was a disappointing follow-up to ""Three Extremes"" but the two shouldn't be compared because they are different films with different messages. I picture only a fan of Asian horror liking this DVD, so if you're new perhaps go with something more user-friendly before diving into this piece.6.5/10",Three Extremes Ii
1202703,"I've had this DVD for some time, but felt moved to review it because it has stood the test of time with me:  in fact, I like it better now than when I first used it.Violet Zaki is perfectly charming and cues well.  Always nice to have in an instructor.  She even cracks a few jokes -- not a comedy routine, just some words to make you smile.  Very likeable.The workouts have a nice mixture of cardio and weight training, often together, which is how I like it.Some of the moves, especially the mat work, looked ungainly to me at first, and I tended to skip them.  But now I find myself doing them because -- well, I suppose I'm improving.Flexibility is important in doing these exercises and I like the stretches that Zaki has you do.  Her cool-down is terrific, really enjoyable.There are one or two things she does, for a brief time, such as 'heel digs', that don't really do anything for me, or that make me concerned about my knees (I've had slight injuries), but at those times I just modify the exercise.  I don't feel that a DVD workout is something that I have to follow at all times, chapter and verse, and sometimes I prefer to keep the previous movement going while they move on to something else.  Or I change to heavier weights or keep my weights if they've put theirs down.  Obviously you have to be aware of what you're doing and think of safety, but if you're an experienced exerciser you can spontaneously 'tailor' a workout while still benefitting from having one to follow.As for the reviewer that claims 'I didn't break a sweat', well, congratulations, you must be in excellent shape!  But in that case I don't think this DVD is for you.  As Zaki says throughout the workout, it's for people who want to improve their fitness:  either those 'new to working out' (who may follow the modified movements of one of the women) or those that are up to a lot more but might have some weight to lose.  I am fairly slim, but I like to have this workout as part of my  routine.Highly recommended.",WEIGHT LOSS CARDIO SCULPT
1238566,I enjoyed this documentary. You follow celebrated banjo player Bela Fleck around Africa while he meets up with incredible musicians and they play together and make great music. Knowing that his instrument has African roots Bela wanted to explore African music and the results of his journey were fruitful. I had the opportunity to see Bela Fleck live this year along with some of the musicians featured in this film and it was one of the greatest live music experiences of my life.,Bela Fleck: Throw Down Your Heart

1147350,"It sounds almost immoral to say this is a ""good"" movie. Horror can never be ""good"".Everybody knew - since the 1940s - that the of Katyn's perpetrators spoke Russian, but it was silenced because the Soviets were the ""good guys"", the ""allies"". And the only one that raised his voice to accuse Moscow, Vladislav Sikorski, had his plane conveniently brought down by ""technical failure"".The NKVD henchmen that participated in the massacre (just 20 to 30 agents) knowing the number of executions that they would have to perform (250 per night) for their boss, Lavrenti Beria, asked for German PPK pistols, because their recoil was less painful to their wrists than the heavy Nagant revolver, and because their Tokarev TT-30 was unreliable for the heavy use intended. Besides, the use of German weapons added plausible deniability in case of exhumation of corpses (it seems they could read the future!). The chief NKVD executioner, Vasili Blokhin, a favorite psychopath of Beria, all clad in black leather, is rumored to have killed  - personally - 7.000 of the 22.0000 prisoners. Blokhin and his henchmen ""worked"" for 10 straight hours, giving us an average of 1 murder every 3 minutes. The blood bath prolonged with cold efficiency (NKVD had a lot of practice since the 1930s purges) for 28 days of April 1940.That's the real dimension of the horror of Katyn.And this is only an example of the bigger horror that had visited Russia, Ukraine, the Caucasus, the Baltic republics since 1918. And after 1945, Ukraine (again), Baltic republics (again), Poland, Germany, Romania, Hungary, Czechoslovakia, Bulgaria, Yugoslavia, etc.Finally, many people miss an important point in this movie, because at the same time that it's a clear indictment against the USSR for genocide against the Polish people, it clearly demolishes the ever present myth that Hitler began the war. It was USSR and Nazi Germany together who began WWII, but UK and France - supposed to be Poland's allies - only declared war against Germany, not the Soviet Union.Why?No wonder 1945 wasn't a time for celebration in half of Europe.",N/A

Lewis' splatter picture BLOOD FEAST in which two brothers belonging to an ancient Lumerian cult open up a chic new diner downtown, where they serve up the locals in a variety of tasty dishes in order to prepare for a carnal blood buffet that they will use to resurrect their goddess Shitar! This zany, off-the-wall Horror Comedy has seemingly been forgotten in the two decades since its release, but its hilarious mixture of slapstick humor and comic gore makes it one of the most entertaining and under-appreciated films of its kind. Following the example set by THE TOXIC AVENGER years earlier, BLOOD DINER contains a number of outrageous deaths, including one where a bouncer has his head crushed in by a passing low-rider, and another where a woman has her head deep-fried before it is knocked off with a broom, while several other characters are impaled by stalactites, run over repeatedly, lopped in half with meat cleavers, or slaughtered in the ravenous bloodbath in the end! It manages to walk the fine line between camp and typical 80's cheese, coming out on top thanks to Kong's smart handling of the material and spirited directing, as well as the animated performances given by each of the cast members (including the tasteless humor of Uncle Anwar's disembodied brain).

As he shelters her in his apartment, other inhabitants of the building begin falling into place as representations of characters from an Eastern myth in which these mermaids, or ""narfs,"" co-exist unhappily with more beastly and violent characters. In human reality, the forces of darkness that threaten the heroes of a fairy tale prove to be much more terrifying, and the victory of good over evil is by no means guaranteed.

472612,"""My Favorite Broadway, The Leading Ladies"" (1999) is a little too much of a good thing.  Originally presented as a concert in Carnegie Hall in September of 1998, it has too many solos by too many different female theater stars for one show. It would be better if there was a thematic approach, interaction among the various celebs, perhaps try to stitch together a plot line, eh? Fewer singers singing two, three, or four number each would be better than a seemingly endless parade of solos. They are all good, but there is a sameness that develops. There are eighteen or so female performers who sing twenty-two songs.Julie Andrews hosts the show, and there's an opening number with Tony Roberts and Robert Morse in campy drag singing a song from ""Sugar"" which really doesn't have anything to do with the rest of the show except it's entertaining. It's a waste of their talents not to have used them in other parts of the show. It's like a benefit performance where people just make an obligatory appearance for a cause.Elaine Stritch gives her iconic, and by now, oh so familiar rendition of ""The Ladies Who Lunch"" from ""Company."" Does anyone still enjoy that song anymore? A lot of the Broadway numbers bring back pleasant memories, and this is certainly a rare and welcome assemblage of some of Broadway's dazzling lights, but having some of these great talents give only one song seems like a great waste of talent to me.Ann Kendricks sings with the Kit Kat Girls from ""Cabaret,"" and Karen Ziemba dances with sixteen Rockettes from Radio City Music Hall in ""Kicks."" Liza Minnelli sings ""Some People"" from ""Gypsy."" Andrea McArdle, Jennifer Holliday, Nell Carter, Dorothy Loudon are a few of the many singers.This is still a choice treat for Broadway musical fans and fanatics.",N/A

718344,"I wondered why this film was so lacking in any sort of reputation (Victory was filmed in 1993 and barely released in Asia in 1999). Not any more. The film really doesn't work, either as a spiritual morality play, as an adventure film or as a love epic. Nothing really clicks or compels. Production values are a notch above but still lacking in force and uninvigorating. It has relatively stable, but bland acting, a great story on paper, nice cinematography, and is marked by a prevalent cast, and still it is lacking brilliance or luster more than 15 years after its release.Victory (1995). Joseph Conrad wrote a fascinating book in Victory in 1915. It is a tale of human alienation that is then followed by a quest for love. I can wholeheartedly concur with that.Where the picture fails is in the two central performances, Axel Heyst (Willem Dafoe) and Alma (Irene Jacob). I felt that the central issue of the movie was not clarified strongly enough, so that the story weakened toward the climax instead of growing stronger. Two great actors and a script with some sharp alteration could have been a very penetrating movie.",Victory

In this splendid set we get aquainted with the four women who make up ""Sex and the City"": Carrie Bradshaw who writes a column called ""Sex and The City"" for a New York newspaper; Miranda, a smart lawyer; Charlotte, a rich brunette; and my favorite ""Sex and the City"" character Samantha, a savy advertising genius who loves men and can't get enough of them. The story mainly revolves around these four women, their friendship with each other, and their attempts at forming relationships with their male counterparts, often ending poorly, but realizing no matter what happens they will always be there for each other. The beautiful city of New York provides the backdrop for the series with the Big Apple actually becoming a character as much as the series' leads.""Sex and the City"" went on to enjoy immense success as one of TV's outstanding cable shows with women and gay men admiring and cherishing the show. Part drama and part comedy, few shows have had that kind of support from its audience even at times when the stories lagged as what would happen in coming seasons.

No other film comes to my mind out of the many (and I do mean MANY) horror films that I've seen that in conversations with other fans, people describe graphic scenes that they recall from the movie that DID NOT HAPPEN ONSCREEN. I don't believe any other movie has had that kind of power; that just through mere suggestion creates images so vivid and complete that they are remembered as actuality...that is a testament to it's power.This two-disc special edition is excellence squared. I owned a previous ""re-mastered"" release, but this transfer simply blows the old one away...it's crisp and clean, but not TOO clean; you don't lose that cinema veritas ""documentary"" feel, but it's definitely the best print I've ever seen. For the audio, you have a choice of either the remastered original mono, or a new 5.1 mix that sounds fantastic in my home theater system...the ambient sounds alone were enough to give me goosebumps as I screened it.For special features, there are two very informative and entertaining documentaries. The ""house tour"" is not all that I expected, but it is entertaining to us fans.

Several of my women friends have commented on the level of violence in the novel.  The violence is here as well, but Lisbeth's reactions to it are worth the price of admission.

1226748,"For a storyline not billed as a thriller, horror or adventure, this one had me hanging on the edge of my seat.  While the film doesn't fit in the prior classifications, there is enough vagueness about Father Flynn, mysteriously played by Philip Seymour Hoffman,  to capture all the elements of a good mystery.  Exactly who this man is, what background he came from, and what his intentions may be, are not fully revealed - and that's exactly how he wants it.Perhaps the good Father relies on faith for those who wish to trust him.  Perhaps he prefers a sense of wonderment to revelation.  Or perhaps he's just a pervert pursuing Donald Miller, a young and vulnerable student and altar boy.  In any case the topics of his sermons, his tendency to avoid direct answers, and his slightly overgrown nails, are enough to arouse the suspicions of those far less curious than the persistent Sister Aloysius, played brilliantly by Meryl Streep.But to what point do we rely on gut instinct over lack of factual evidence?  To what extent must we do the ""right"" thing in spite of personal consequences?  And what's the ratio of prevailing goodness to sins that are washed away?  This movie asks all these questions while attempting to answer none of them.Therefore, for those liking well-rounded conclusions, then the ending may be a disappointment.  But if you believe as Alfred Hitchcock did that the greatest horror exists in the human mind, then I would highly recommend this drama.Other than my disappointment that the Supporting Actress nomination wasn't an Oscar win for Viola Davis, who played Donald's mother, my only complaint was that the movie was too short.

Live teachers are crucial to help you really understand each pose and work towards flowing into and out of a pose correctly.)

1034243,"Bloody Ties (Ho Choi, 2005)Fun little movie, if nothing original; the mismatched-cop storyline attached to the rise and fall of drug lords in South Korea that revolved around influxes of IMF money in the nineties. Except in this case one of the mismatched cops is a small-time pusher. If you're a fan of action comedies, this should be right up your alley.Sangdo (Sympathy for Mr. Vengeance's Seung-beom Ryu) is a street dealer who specializes in crystal meth. He's also been a snitch for the last five years, working for scruffy police lieutenant Do (Black House's Jeong-min Hwang). Things are going along just fine until the movements of the IMF and World Bank depress the drug culture in Pusan, giving rise to a gung-ho district attorney who's bent on putting as many drug dealers behind bars as possible. This includes Sangdo, who goes down for eight months. The money moves again while he's in the slammer, though, and a new druglord takes over his territory: the sadistic Jangcheol (The Divine Weapon's Do-gyung Lee). Do, in disgrace, wants to bring Jangcheol down. Sangdo wants his territory back. Since the two already know each other pretty well, why not team up and try to bring the guy down?It's brainless, it's got cardboard characters, way too many things blow up, and if you like this sort of thing, you'll love every minute of it. I thought it was a little on the shallow side; Jangcheol is just too evil, while Sangdo is too dealer-with-a-heart-of-gold, but Choi (who also co-wrote the screenplay) does throw some nice twists in now and again (did I mention the DA is too slimy for words?) and Hyun-jae Oh, in his first cinematography job, does a competent enough job to hold the eye's interest.

Having a brother with autism makes this film even more relatable to my life, and while I don't agree with everything Temple Grandin has said about autism throughout her life, she has quite a story.",N/A

982976,"""Superman: The Animated Series, Volume 3"" has some of the best and worst episodes of the series. The first disc has nothing but great episodes on it. First we have ""Warrior Queen"". A great comical episode about a warrior queen from another planet who falls in love with the Man of Steel, and she won't take no for an answer when Superman rejects her. A laugh out loud episode with some great action in it too. Then we have the two-part ""Apokolips...Now!"" which I think is still one of the greatest episodes of all time. Darkseid launches an all-out attack on Earth, and even Superman is powerless to stop him. It is the most action-packed and emotional story of them all. It also has the very best ending out of all the episodes as well. Then we have the two-part ""Little Girl Lost"" which is another classic episode that introduces Supergirl. Next up is ""Where There's Smoke"" which isn't one of my favorite episodes, but it's still enjoyable and has a good mystery in it. It's actually more of a Batman type episode. Although Batman does not appear in it, the story itself is more like what you would see for a Batman episode. There's even a part in it where Superman roughs a guy up a little in order to get information out of him.Then for side A of disc 2 we have some great and terrible episodes. First we have ""Knight Time"" which is a great episode where Superman joins forces with Robin in order to find Batman who has mysteriously disappeared. This episode has a lot of comical moments in it, a lot of mystery, and a lot of action too. Plus you have some Batman villains as well. Then comes ""New Kids in Town"" which is another great episode where Brainiac travels back in time to Smallville to kill a young Clark Kent before he became Superman and it's up to three Legionnaire superheroes to stop him. Then we have ""Obsession"" which I think is a terrible episode. But then again this one does have the Toyman in it, and I never really did like the Toyman. I'm surprised I liked his premiere episode ""Fun and Games"" from Volume 1. Then we have ""Little Big Head Man"" which was a real disappointment. In it we have Mxyzptlk and Bizarro joining forces, but it aint anything like the pervious Bizarro and Mxyzptlk episodes. It aint funny, just annoying. Then we have ""Absolute Power"" which did have a good story and some impressive animation in it, but the script was just too out there. Like when Superman saves a spaceship from a Black Hole. This is the same man who had problems landing a plane in the pilot episode, and yet he can withstand the G-Forces of a Black Hole! Give me a break! But the story was still good. Maybe not one of my favorite episodes, but it's not the worst either. Then we have ""In Brightest Day..."" in which Superman must join forces with the Green Lantern. I found this episode to be highly enjoyable.As for side B of disc 2... we have ""Superman's Pal"", and I don't care what anybody says, this episode was a great episode. It has a great story, lots of mystery, lots of comedy, and lots of action. Plus we really do get to see some nice charater moments in it between Superman and Jimmy. Then we have ""A Fish Story"" in which Superman meets Aquaman, and the two must combine forces against Lex Luthor who threatens millions of innocent people from Aquaman's home - Atlantis. A great action-packed episode with a good story. Plus I really love Lois' charater in this one too as we see her dodging bullets and out running the bad guys on a motor bike. I just loved that part. A great episode if you ask me. Then we have ""Unity"" which was a great alien invasion story that has Supergirl in it. Kind of a scary one too. Another great episode in my books. Then we have ""The Demon Reborn"" in which Superman and Batman once again join forces. This time they're battling the immortal Ra's Al Ghul, one of my all time favorite Batman villains. A fine Superman/Batman crossover episode. Then last, but not least, we have the two-part series' finale ""Legacy"". This might come as a shock to many people, but this is the one episode that caused me to give this review four stars instead of five. It has a great story in it, and a lot of action, but the end completely ruined it for me. In this one Darkseid brainwashes Superman into attacking Earth. After Superman recovers from his brainwashing, he, and Supergirl who had nothing to do with the attack and actually fought against Superman, are imprisioned by the U.S. government and sentenced to death. Thanks to Lois, Superman and Supergirl manage to escape. Superman has his final battle with Darkseid, but returns to Earth hated and feared by everyone. A terrible ending for an episode itself, and especially a series. A great series with a terrible ending.In all, although ""Legacy"" was a terrible episode, this volume still had some of the best episodes in the series, and it would be a shame for any Superman fan to go without.Highly recommended!","Superman: The Animated Series, Volume 3"

254846,"Tarkovsky's ""The Mirror""(1975) is more like a visual poem than a narrative story. Images jump forward and backward in time depicting thoughts and emotions of Alexei (Ignat Daniltsev) from childhood, and as an adult, from prewar to postwar. This is largely an autobiographical film that references back to Tarkovsky's childhood. Poetry written and spoken by Tarkovsky's father is intermingled with scenes. Mirrors are constantly being used. Sometimes mirrors are used like windows into the future. In one scene Alexei's mother, Maria (Margarita Terekhova), is looking into a mirror and sees an old woman (herself in the future). This scene then transitions into the old woman's present time. There are some instances like this in the film where one is reminded of scenes from Stanely Kubrick's film ""2001"" (1968) where one leaps forward in time or seems to be looking into the future. This film depicts the gaze as a reflection of the world of memories divorced from time, and so the mirror, the reflection of self, can be seen as a metaphor of the ephemeral, and as a window into memory and dreams.This film is in 1.33:1 aspect ratio and has not been remastered. It has color and black and white sequences. The audio is Dolby Digital 2.0 Stereo in Russian with English subtitles. This film was originally filmed in mono.

1387551,"Thundarr the Barbarian has finally been released to DVD after so many fans have waited for so many years! I truly do applaud the Warners for these ""exclusive"" set by set releases for those classics from the Warner library that have the cult following to warrant their release but, apparently, not quite enough for release to the commercial (retail) market.For those who are unfamiliar with the story, the opening credits do a good job of delving us into the action via the following SPOILER ALERT. In 1994, a meteor passing between the Earth and moon causes an apocolyptic end to ""Old"" Earth (obviously, this has not happened but, during the initial airings, it was fourteen years too early to tell). Anyway, Earth civilization is cast into ruin and, two thousand years later, Earth is reborn as a bastion of a combination of the realms of savagery, super science, and sorcery. If you're not sold on this concept yet, it is simply because I cannot explain it as eloquently as the show's producers at Ruby Spears, a subset of Warner Brothers/Hanna-Barbera lore.PROS:It's Thundarr the Barbarian! He was a blonde, over-muscled swordsman who wielded a mystic weapon and, with the help of his allies, Ookla, the Mok [wookie creature], and vuluptuous sorceress, Princess Ariel, saved an Earth reborn (if you think I'm describing a different iconic '80's hero who also utilized a mystic sword, don't be confused). Anyway, at the demands of many loyal fans, YouTubists, and avid Boomerang/Original Cartoon Network viewers, the Warners have given us a sort-of commercial release of this show directly through its website. Not only that but the source material that they used is in great shape.CONS:Notably missing are the classic ""Ruby Spears"" logos ending each episorde, replaced by the Hanna Barbera ""Action/Adventure"" montage generated by Turner Broadcasting around 1990-1991 and replacing the sound with what remains of the end theme. It's a deceptive end of show bumper as, at this time, there was a distinction between ""Hanna Barbera"" and ""Ruby Spears."" My best guess, as the ""Ruby Spears"" bumpers were missing from the 1980s release of ""Saturday Morning Cartoons"" as well, is that there is some legal problem or another with the release of the ""RS"" bumper.Anyway, there you have it, folks. Do not be deceived by my long list of cons; or by my ridiculous sounding review of the show. This is surely a Saturday Morning Cartoon to be enjoyed through the use of rose-colored retro glasses and right now, this nonretailer commercial release from the Warner Brothers Archive Collection is the way to go.",N/A

The underwater shots, the giant scorpions, the battle with Medusa, the flying horse Pegasus, the ultimate destruction of the Kraken, etc, the whole film is magnificent.

I was happy to add it to my collection because it has an element to it that separated it from others, in that not only is there a alien with a nasty attitude but it can reanimate the people it kills and make them just as nasty.  Even though the acting here is admittedly not the greatest in the world, it's still a good creepy scifi/horror movie and I recommend it just for the creep effect.

1343259,"WARNING:SPOILERS AHEAD!Firstly, I've not read the novel this movie is based on. So my comments are for this film only.Secondly, the most interesting about this picture is Noomi Rapace's engaging acting. She vividly played Lisbeth Salander who was a chain smoker, drinker and skillful computer hacker. What an attitude she had. She did not get mad, she always got even. There was more to her character but I would not reveal them here.Thirdly, the plot was complicated. It dealt with many problems such as police's power abuse, domestic violence, serial killing. These problems were depicted in many extremely disturbing scenes. They made me very angry seeing how much emotionally Lisbeth was suffering.  The plot also involves deep relationship between the  niece and her uncle. The uncle's love for his niece was strongly expressed from the beginning till the end. The last scene touched my heart.Fourthly, the most ridiculous aspect is this movie has at least 4 big logical holes that greatly erode my interest. If it had been a fantasy movie, I'd would have ignored its logic deficiency. However, it's a kind of detective and drama movie. So, logic is one of its foundations! I won't list all of the holes I found but one here. For example, after a member of Vanger family saved Mikael from being killed by the owner of the house he just broke in, he told his savior everything about his investigation. Consequently, he paid dearly later! Before that, the film had always shown most of the Vanger members including his savior just wanted him to go home. Why on earth, suddenly Mikael turned into a man with the brain of a junior high school student? Why many detective/investigative movies have the same problem? Because of this I gave this movie 3 stars.In short, it's worth watching once especially if you want something different from Hollywood stuff.",N/A

947434,"Mainly based upon an American Journey's Tour (culminating into a couple of concerts in Houston and Cleveland) supporting the hit album ""Escape"" on 1981, you can find some other sessions within a 4 months effort at MTV, inside the present DVD live (dated 2005). But of course their main show- taken on November 6, 1981 and featuring the most famous line up with Neal Schon, Steve Perry, Jonathan Cain, Ross Valory and Steve Smith- is not always on the most inspiring side of AOR rock. Nevertheless there are always their biggest hit singles...even though- apart from the passion and strong vocal interpretation as well by S. Perry- I'm a little bit disturbed when I listen to a kind of ""boogie rock"" entitled ""Line of fire"" and sometimes tired too, owing to their usual ballads, such as ""Lights"", ""Stay Awhile"", and ""Open Arms"".Anyway- fortunately- ""Mother/Father"" is one of the most ""convincing"" and heavier songs from ""Escape"", and above all it's not a commercial hit!! Then I like the guitar solo by N. Schon within ""Who's Crying Now"", this latter being a ballad in the opening section, but growing by means of the emotional feeling expressed in the guitar line of the following section...at the end I wait for ""Wheel In The Sky"", probably the best example regarding the style of the guitarist; nevertheless the easy melodic soloings by Neal have been often appreciated also in the pop hits. Moreover I like to mention the excellent production quality (if you consider the record dated 1981!!), with the support of MTV, performing a very good job here- as long as you find an additional song, ""The Party's Over"" , combined with the Escape TV Promo (this latter enriched by means of the interviews) , which all together make this product of ""AOR"" music quite an important event. In fact They were able to witness the most melodic moments, according to the typical mood of the early eighties, in the Golden Age of such an interesting American simple rock (however equal to Styx and Boston, just to mention a couple of bands with the same style within that period...).An interesting film for an easy melodic rock-I mean, from a shrewd ever-green band! You know that I prefer the effective prog music genre, in comparison to the world of prog related or AOR music but- talking about Journey- I recognize their importance inside the world of pop music... at the end- for me- it could be enough to think of giving it over an half star in the evaluation, at least!!","Journey - Live in Houston 1981, The Escape Tour"

Boy, it turns out that I am dead wrong. It's not them really. Christmas with the Kranks is basically watching Christmas in Nazi Germany. The poor writing drowned the picture, and the life values were destroyed by wrong messages. Just because a husband and wife want to go on a cruise...let them be. Nothing wrong with it. But...a town doesn't think so! Wake up and smell the coffee...this is America where the most close-minded people live in and that they prefer their privacy. Watching Christmas with the Kranks and seeing the message that the picture delivers, it just wants me to puke. If I ever see this Spike kid, I am gonna make a Spike out of him. I never even got the answer from Christmas with the Kranks to the question why the daughter was coming back from Peace Corps mission. You know, that mission is a two-year thing. Looking at that girl, I have to be in a disbelief. There is not a lot of humor found in Christmas with the Kranks, but of course, plenty of nauseous feeling and boredom helped to set in. Christmas with the Kranks is a totally unappreciative picture that takes a cheap shot of stealing the adorable and so fine majestic spirit of Christmas. Okay...let us pause here. Exactly what kind of people the picture focuses on? I see a family that spends $6,100 on Christmas alone with a husband who is probably a partner on a law firm and big houses along with other big houses filled with predominately white Anglo Saxon Protestants. I suspect the audience for this picture is very limited. On comedic level, Christmas with the Kranks doesn't par up well with National Lampoon's Christmas Vacation.

172582,"American Icons have been under attack the last half-century or so, a process that was started by the Left, accelerated in the '60s by the counter-culture, and carried on in the 70s-today by Hollywood and television.  You name it, if it's an American Icon, it's been trashed ..... the church, the Pilgrims, Columbus, George Washington, sports heroes, American business, the American military, the police, the President, ""Dead White Males,"" etc etc.  All to cut out our beliefs, make us weak, make us ashamed of our heritage, and open us up to radical change.  BUT there was always the Cowboy.  The Cowboy, the strong, self-reliant, self-confident yet humble, physically and mentally tough Cowboy.  He faced down the elements, wild animals, Indian attacks, and outlaws; he rode horses all day, roped cattle, slept out in front of a fire, and shot guns when he had to.  Now THAT was an image that Americans could look upon and get some inspiration from.So of course, Hollywood had to go after the Cowboy and trash him in our minds.  Replace that image with something twisted.  OK, let's see, let's make him gay!  And two of them getting it on out in the wilderness!  Now, make this into a seemingly intelligent, compelling & artful movie, so the critics have less reason to put it down, and there it is ............ you've just shot down one of America's icons.  Anytime anyone brings up the Cowboy as an example of America's proud past and toughness, and some snide jerk will snicker, ""Oh yeah, just like Brokeback Mountain,"" and undercut the argument with sarcasm and derision.  SO that's what this movie is all about.  It's called Cultural Marxism.  Destroy America's cultural icons, and you can manipulate Americans.  (See my review of American Beauty for another example.)The filmmakers dropped two gay Greenwich Villiage guys into Wyoming and Texas, made them cowboys, and ran their little ""love"" story.  They COULD HAVE changed the characters and setting and kept a similar story, but no, they had to go for the jugular, and trash the image of the Cowboy.  Next thing you know, they'll make a movie about Patton and make him gay.  Or two gay Marines on Iwo Jima.  Whatever.As for the plot, the acting, the scenery, the story, the music, the directing, that's all secondary to this agenda.  But I give the movie 3 stars because much as you might HATE the agenda, the story is entertaining.",N/A
319360,"The ""Alice"" books by Lewis Carroll have always been about a young girl's dreamlike journey as she subconsciously comes to grips with the seemingly absurd rituals of language and behaviour in the adult world around her. In Wonderland these absurdities are magnified and personified in a series of bizarre encounters. Visionary surrealist director Jan Svankmajer has brought these characters vividly to life using the stop motion animation of bizarre objects from Alice's home that she walks among after descending into the nonsensical realm.The films opening shows an Alice who is silent - but radiates boredom, frustration and confusion with the oppressive world around her. Sitting among her toys, crockery and a bizarre collection of taxidermy exhibits in the house, she watches a stuffed rabbit enliven and run into a draw - where she follows him to wonderland. She shrinks and grows - turning into her doll as she does so - is chased by animals that are live skeletons and taxidermy animals, watches the caterpillar build himself from a sock, some glass eyes and some false teeth, dines with the Mad Hatter and his crew -  a puppet, a wind-up and a fur stole - and plays croquet with a group of playing card cut outs in a toy theatre.The interpretation might not be for everyone, as it eschews the whimsy and poetry of the story to focus on the surreal and psychological elements.

Going one step further, Coppola takes '80's music (decade of ""excess"") and jams it into the landscape like a sword. New Order was a perfect choice for this age of decadence.Every frame of this picture is a work of art. Slow, and dreamy--and insulated much like Marie Antoinette's life must have been at that time. I kept waiting for ""the poor"" to show up--the suffering to be exposed and then I realized it wasn't because it simply wasn't a part of her world.

350018,"In 1994, coming off one of the worst Royal Rumble's to that point in WWF history, the quality of the broadcast improved significantly and was actually fun to watch again for two main reasons:First, all the matches before the main Rumble event (Harts/Quebecs, Razor/IRS, Undertaker/Yokozuna) were quite interesting/exciting in their own right.  They each advanced a storyline and featured some quality athletic feats, not just a bunch of fat guys rolling around that had been the standard for the past few years for the WWF.Also, many of the participants of those matches actually compete in the Rumble itself this year, solving the problem of having all the interesting characters wiped out before the big brawl even began.  Plus, the frequency of the ""jobbers"" was a bit more few-and-far-between.  The depth of big names might still have been lacking, but most of the characters at least had interesting personas that one could either root for or despise.Finally, the ending of the Rumble is one that ranks right up their in the history of the event.  I won't give it away here, but suffice it to say that you will be shocked when the final bell rings.Overall, this was a nice edition to the pantheon of RR events, especially considering the failure of the '93 edition.",WWF: Royal Rumble 1994 VHS
1082624,"I'm a gorehound who is willing to accept gore for gore's sake - but Automaton Transfusion just struck me as a totally pointless film.  Yes, there is a lot of blood and gore, but it's nothing I haven't seen before, and what I assume was supposed to be the most visceral moment in the film came across as somewhat comical to me.  I also found it somewhat awkward that the filmmakers would suddenly decide to cram a storyline in to the film with about fifteen minutes to go.  It's as if they set out to make a film in search of a plot but chickened out at the last minute.  I guess they did achieve their goal of making a zombie film that starts out kicking it hardcore and keeps the blood flowing until the very end, but it came at the expense of both story and character development.  I only liked one character in the whole movie, and he ultimately let me down by going squirrelly on me.  As for the ending, I have to be blunt and say it totally sucked - a true WTF moment, and not in a good way.This film was reportedly shot in nine days at a cost of just thirty thousand dollars.  That being the case, the gory special effects are impressive.  It's actually too much of a good thing, though, because all the pointless bloodshed eventually ends up boring the experienced horror movie fan.  Even the title bugs me because I have no idea what it is referring to.  Maybe I would have found out if I had bothered to watch the movie again with the director/producer commentary, but I really had no desire to sit through this nonsense a second time.  I tried watching the making-of featurette, but after about five minutes I decided that I really just didn't care.  That pretty much sums up my view of the film as a whole - I just didn't care.",Automaton Transfusion

360848,"Jacques Tati, a wonderful actor and one of the greatest film directors who has only created six feature films but watching it today, you can't help but feel he was ahead of his time.  The French filmmaker who saw the Paris that he grew up with becoming a different Paris that is today.With his Charlie Chaplin-esque character Monsieur Hulot, his second film ""Las Vacancdes de Monsieur Hulot"" (Mr. Hulot's Holiday) would introduce the character and would earn Tati his first Academy Award nomination for ""Best Original Screenplay"".  His third major feature ""Mon Oncle"" (1958) would be Tati's first film in color and would focus on the disappearance of the Paris that he once knew and France's obsession with modern architecture and gadgetry but also American-style consumerism.The film not only had impact in France but also in America as the film would win an Academy Award for ""Best Foreign Language Film"", a Special Prize at the Cannes Film Festival and also a New York Film Critics Award.VIDEO & AUDIO:""Mon Oncle"" is presented in color and in 1:33:1 aspect ratio.  For a film created in 1958, The Criterion Collection has done a good job in transferring the film to DVD.  There are some situations where you do see the occasional dust and scratches of the film but for the most part, for a film that is over 50-years-old, ""Mon Oncle"" looks quite beautiful on DVD.As for the film, according to Criterion, the digital transfer was created from a 35mm interpositive.  I would hope to see that the film was run through their MTI Digital Restoration system to minimize the scratches and dust but this was an older DVD release from 2001.  The film looks good but knowing Criterion and what they have accomplished with earlier films that they re-released, I hoped ""Mon Oncle"" is definitely considered for remastering and restoration in the near future.  After seeing what The Criterion Collection has done with Tati's ""Play Time"" on Blu-ray, it makes me wonder what they can do with ""Mon Oncle"" if they choose to re-release it.  I'm sure it would look equally as beautiful and vibrant.As for the audio, the audio is presented in Monaural and according to Criterion, the sound was mastered from the 35mm magnetic tracks.  I personally chose to listen to the film with audio on my home theater receiver set for stereo on all channels for a better audio experience with my 7.2 setup.  But for the most part, sound is clear and the music by Franck Barcellini and Alain Romans is fantastic.Optional subtitles are featured in English.SPECIAL FEATURES:""Mon Oncle"" comes with the following special features:* Video Introduction- (5:07) A video introduction by writer, director and performer Terry Jones who knows a lot about Jacques Tati's work and his impressions of ""Mon Oncle"" when he first watched it and now.* L'ecole des facteurs - (15:04) The second short film directed and starring Jacques Tati back in 1947.  The short film is about a new postman who has a job to deliver his mail on bike and must take outgoing mail to the airplane in time.  But with challenges he meets on the job, will he be able to get the mail out in time?JUDGMENT CALL:Fantastic!  A Jacques Tati masterpiece that has its relevance even today with the technological changes that we have experienced in the last 25-years and have become so dependent on technology for everyday life, one can't help but understand and sympathize with Jacques Tati as he had experienced in 1958 and seeing part of the world that he lived in, changing with technology and modernism.After watching ""Playtime"" (my first Tati film), I knew what to expect.  Granted, ""Playtime"" was even more modern and so ambitious for Tati, ""Mon Oncle"" is a much purer film as it doesn't rely on extravagant buildings or sets or many people and vehicles being choreographed to move a certain way.It's the characters through Hulot's eyes and also Gerard's eyes that intrigue us.  From his landlord's daughter who we see grow up with each scene to Gerard and his friends trying to fake car accidents, there is a lot to watch and take in visually and have a fun time with what Hulot provides.  There are scenes that I didn't see the first time, that I saw on the second watch especially through the Arpel side and the technology used.  From the vacuum cleaner that doesn't need a human, to the automatic window cleaner and speaking of technology, how about the garage door that activates with a sensor and traps its owners in the garage, or the modern furniture that may look visually appealing but not in terms of comfort, to the actual design of their modern home and how difficult it is for the party goers where there they have to watch where they step in and rely on the various stones.Considering that day in time where people wanted to move forward in technology and people can only imagine what the future had in store, here we are in today's modern age, dependent on technology and those things we enjoyed 25-years-ago may all be part of the past but featured in a different manner.  One would imagine how Tati would have filmed a Hulot film in today's world.There can be comparisons with Tati's ""Mon Oncle"" and Charlie Chaplin's ""Modern Times"" and Rene Clair's ""A nous la liberte"" but where those two films are more similar to each other, ""Mon Oncle"" is much different.  Part of me feels that Tati created these films as almost a time capsule of how things were like and will never be. This is a story about a man caught in the world of the old and the new and using comedy to show that transition.  The film is satirical, full of gags and for me, visually poetic but in someways, there is some sadness to the film (in my perspective) because there is no way Hulot and I would guess a lot of those others in the old French neighborhood would comfortable in this modernist world.  In one scene, a grocer from old Paris delivers food to the Arpel's and he is just in awe of the lifestyle and home that they live in.I've read that the US release of ""My Uncle"" was quite different (Tati filmed an English version at the same time) and through editing, signs were changed and certain scenes were eliminated.  Especially how the Arpel's and their friends spoke in English while the French side of Hulot's world do not.  It would be been nice if the Criterion Collection was to revisit this release, to include the English version on Blu-ray.Overall, ""Mon Oncle"" is another visual feast from Jacques Tati and with many people discovering ""Playtime"" on Blu-ray, hopefully many of these viewers who enjoyed the film will also give ""M. Hulot's Holiday"", ""Mon Oncle"" and ""Trafic"" (which the three are also available on DVD via The Criterion Collection) a chance.  Definitely recommended!",Mon Oncle VHS

1284807,"...and the Spectre short is just as good.This hour and ten minute feature is loosely based on the two part ""Crisis on Earth Three"" story in Justice League of America #29 and #30 back in the '60s. Having watched the Justice League and Justice League Unlimited DVD sets I fairly jumped on this one.I'm pleased to say that that this is a very fine effort. There is substantial evidence that this was produced some years ago. The lack of a Hawkgirl and the hint of a membership drive place it squarely between the Justice League and Justice League Unlimited seasons.The plot is relatively straightforward. Lex Luthor, the sole surviving member of the Justice League on his world, comes to the ""our"" Justice League's world for help against the super powered Crime Syndicate (doppelgangers of the Justice League). But the Crime Syndicate's Owl Man has his own agenda...The story is exciting and action packed. It's well acted, despite missing some of the regular voices. Perhaps it wasn't voiced over until much later? Especially good are the scenes with Owl Man and Superwoman.The Spectre short is very moody and atmospheric. I thought there might be something wrong with my DVD or TV but the phony defects are for effect only.In short, if you like super hero features, and especially if you liked the various Justice League incarnations, pick this one up.",N/A
473284,"I have seen this a few times, none recent. It is based on Crichton'sEaters of the Dead, which is based on Beowulf and on Ahmad ibn Fadlan ibn al-Abbas ibn Rasid ibn Hammad's ""Kitab ila Mulk al-Saqaliba"" from the 10th century. It's a credit to the film that when I was reading bits of Ahmad ibn Fadlan's works recently, I thought of the movie.It's a strong film - unfortunately even such excellent sources are no guarantee, as we saw in the 2007Beowulfmovie. This is one of the few films that I prefer to the book (Crichton's: not the original Beowulf nor the translations likeSeamus Haney'sorBurton Raffel'sand certainly not Ahmad ibn Fadlan's works). I though Jurassic Park was a better book than the film - although the film was still a good adaptation. Writers like Crichton, David Morrell and Stephen King seem to write in ways that lend themselves well to film adaptations.Beowulf is a personal favorite - despite the fact that it's obviously myth since the Danes would have been sending heroes to rescue others. =)Gareth Hindsmade a brilliant adaptation of Beowulf as a graphic novel, basing the text on Grummere's translation.This is a compelling story, with a believable - if uncommon - setting which requires little suspension of disbelief. The scripting and characterizations are strong, and the wardrobe and settings are well done. The contrast of the clean, fine Arabic sensibilities with the rough, crude European sensibilities are historically accurate and well used, leading to a little humor both for ibn Fadlan, in his role as the chronicler, and at his expense. The tale bridges the centuries well, although it does leave one hungry for more (this is why I gave it four stars).",The 13th Warrior

245892,Bloodsport from 1988 directed by Newt Arnold he's done a lot of 2nd unit work on big big name movies. What more can I say. It stars Jean Claude Van Damme as Frank Dux Donald Gibb as Ray Jackson Leah Ayers as Janice Kent & Bolo Yeung as Chong Li. Story is Frank Dux goes AWOL to compete in the Kumite a full contact tournament in Hong Kong. While in Hong Kong he meets Ray Jackson who is also competing in the tournament. He also strikes up a relationship with Reporter  Janice Kent. 1 of the competitors is messing with her & this is where we meet Chong Li.

Van Damme is furious about it he wants a fight with Chong Li Janice tries to stop it she thinks it's too barbaric. Frank & Chong Li have a well done fight a rememberable fight he makes Chong Li say I quit. I know this was another bad outline for the plot. Jean Claude Van Damme is good for an early role. Being a Martial Artist doesn't  hurt either that's why a lot people kept having Van Damme for these tournament films. I thought Leah Ayers was good too. Donald Gibb was alright for what he had to do.

1195381,"The mysterious, Gothic feel of The Wolfman was really well-done.  First of all, it was great of Universal Pictures to release this film on a full moon.  Unfortunately the full moon hit Valentines' weekend.  *shrug* What do you do??Unlike the 1941 Lon Chaney, Jr. version, which took place in the then-contemporary pre-WWII Europe, this picture takes place in 1890s England, apparently right outside of London, in the inevitably named ""Blackmoor.""  Nice.Benicio del Toro seems a bit miscast at first glance.  But viewers find out early in the film that Sir Talbot married a Latin woman, so Benitio's Latin looks makes sense.  Without the ""Why me?"" look of Lon Chaney, Jr., Benicio had the fear of God in him instead.This fear seemed real and sincere, as he discovers he is cursed.  Cursed from the bite of a werewolf.  He implores the local gypsies to help him but this version of Maleva is not much help.  Her advice is to put Larry Talbot out of his misery.  Silver bullets no extra charge.Quite a surprise as to who the other werewolf is (no spoilers here).  The duo werewolf smack-down will make any WWE fan proud.Larry getting captured and locked up in a mental asylum was quite intense.  The director's view of psychiatry as a barbaric science with its use of ice-baths to cure delusion and sticking him with some kind of drugs has, unfortunately, not changed that much in 21st century psychiatric practice.  We've graduated to electro-shock treatments from ice-baths.  A true horror story.The transformation of the man to wolf is great.  Memories of The American Werewolf in London will come to you, and naturally so, because Rick Baker had something to do with both films.  But where to the wolfman's clothes go?  Does he pick up after himself after each transformation?  But I digress.As in the first Universal picture, there is a mild love interest.  It's a subdued, subplot however.Anthony Hopkins (chewing up enough scenery to gorge on!) is delightfully demented as Sir Talbot, Sr.  The gothic mansion atop the hill with moon shining down in its full glory is so iconic -- and the fake time-lapse movement of our lunar neighbor as it glows through the dead tree branches and storm clouds brings back more memories of Universal pictures past.Example:  The usual villagers with torches marching through the forest (with the baying dogs and such, reminiscent of Frankenstein).  The deep howl of the wolfman as he bays at the moon, as he gorges on the liver and intestines of his latest victim.  Oh, the hopping from the rooftops, again reminiscent of Henry Hall's wolfman, Werewolf of London (which predates Chaney's version).The music evokes a mood and the plot moves along quite swiftly.  At times, the audience is surprised as if the director says ""boo"" out of a closet or something.  He does this a bit too often, but it's still fun to do.If you are any kind of a Universal fan and have waited for a more adult treatment of this film, then you really should watch this film.  See how many iconic pictures you can spot as Universal digs deep into its vault of horror.So don't be a cynic -- turn off your brain, don't think, and enjoy this bit of entertainment.Warning: much gore and decapitations ensue!I understand Bride of Frankenstein is coming soon.

It wise cracks and has sex with one of the characters!  Pretty ""menacing"". That's the false advertising.  The dialog between these characters is beneath contempt, the violence is crassly done without any sense of creativity.

1224497,"Being a Sherlock Holmes fan for nearly two decades now, I've read every one of Doyle's stories and have seen a ton of different versions of Holmes and Watson.  Basil Rathbone was far too stiff, Nigel Bruce far too idiotic.  A few other actors were entertaining but didn't quite meet up to task (though Peter Cushing took hold of my heart for writing on his cuff - So very Holmes, that!).  Jeremy Brett has always been my all time favorite portrayer of the role... until now.Downey's Holmes and Law's Watson are flawless, especially when you consider that all the Holmes stories except for two are written from Watson's point of view.  (Seriously, people, if you were writing about your best friend, would you tell them EVERYTHING about them?  Or would you couch your words to be as gentle, if honest, as possible?)  The Holmes in this film is the Holmes in the stories: a drug addict, a recluse until something catches his attention, suspicious of women (his behavior towards both Irene Adler and Mary Morstan reflects this), an expert fighter, deliberately ""forgetful"" when it's to his advantage, manipulative, impulsive, and extremely irritating but, at the same time, devoutly loyal to his friends, even if he may taunt them mercilessly.  Equally, we see the Watson as he was written in the stories: organized, caring, intelligent (something often neglected in other films), patient (with Holmes, you really have to be) but only to a point, and most importantly loyal.  The line in the movie that best describes Holmes and Watson is ""Brother not in blood but in bond"" and that is what you get with this movie.I can absolutely guarantee this is one DVD that is going to get played a TON!",N/A

972711,"As a film it's professionally made. However, Israeli films like this one, Lemon Tree and others like James Journey to Jerusalem, Beaufort, and Waltzing With Bashir cause great damage to Israel with their negative depiction of Israelis. There are extremes on both sides, rich, poor, strong or weak, but the general tendancy of the leftist liberal Israeli filmmakers is to complain, point out what's bad about Israel, criticize rather than show us what's beautiful and positive, i.e., Israeli doctors saving the lives of hundreds of Palestinians in Israeli hospitals, Arab-Israeli students enjoying one of the highest standards of education, freedom of speech, freedom of religion, national medical insurance, benefits Jews in Arab countries never enjoyed. Rather they were persecuted, and 800,000 of them were expelled from their homes from 1948-1950. Mostly Israelis in Israeli films are seen as unsympathetic, brutal bullies abusing the ""poor victimized"" Palestinians, while the Palestinians are glorified as heroic, resisting Israeli racism, far from the truth. Whenever Israeli leftist filmmakers deal with the Palestinians they are apologetic, forgetting the thousands of Israeli civilians and soldiers (young sons & daughters of Israel) murdered and maimed by Arab wars and Palestinian terror spanning 60 years since the birth of the nation, and going back to the 1800's culminating with the slaughter of the entire unarmed Jewish population of Hebron in 1929. One must also remember that Palestinians murdered and maimed 100,000 Christians in Lebanon which provoked the Christian revenge at Sabra and Shatila that got extensive media coverage while atrocities committed by the Palestinians & Muslims were and still are covered up out of fear of offending them even following the 9/11, and Ft. Hood murders. Israelis should learn PR from the Arabs who will never, ever criticize their suicide bombers and terrorist gunmen, rather they celebrate them as great heroes and martyers, boasting about their crimes rather than expressing guilt or shame over their murder and maiming of civilians. Syrian Bride shows the Syrian-Druze as hating Israel. Why not make a film about the thousands of heroic Israeli-Druze who serve in elite Israeli combat units and love Israel and serve in the Isreali army with honor? Anyone seeing these negative Israeli films gets a distorted view of Israel and its valiant people, and I deplore not only these stupid films, but the Israel Film Center that support these ""Israel bashing"" movies. One yearns to see Israeli films return to days when Israel was represented by the lumnious and humane films i.e., I Love You Rosa, and The Policeman, or see Israeli filmmakers make films about Israelis like My Fat Greek Wedding which presented Greeks (in America) lovingly, and since Israeli-Arab Jews and Greeks have such similar cultures, one wonders why Jews cannot make such films about themselves that would endear them to the world. Israel has such a rich culture, whereas a majority of Jews in America immigrated from Eastern Europe and predominantly ""Yiddish"" culture, the majority of Jews in Israel have either been there for centuries following their return from Spain in the 14th century, or were among the Jewish refugees expelled from Arab countries and they have very colorful Sephardi/Hebrew/Arab influenced cultures that can be translated delightfully into film. It's time for Israel to start making positive films about themselves, their heroes, i.e., the great warriors who have fought to protect Israel and preserve the Jewish nation, i.e., Avi Kahalani, and other heroes like him who fought for their country with honor. The time has come to stop appeasing and kissing the asses of Arabs and uphold Israel as a heroic nation which it is for others to see, i.e, while no Arab help came to Haiti earthquake victims, a team of 222 Israeli doctors and other emergency personnel went to help rescue the Haitian people, providing them with medical and other humanitarian assistance. The UN calls Israeli war criminals for protecting themselves, but are silent when Israeli civilians are massacred. That's what we want to see Jews of Israel as heroes, not Israelis complaining, bitching and moaning about Israel. We want to see stories about the heroic saga of the Jewish Etheopians in Israel adusting to living in the 20th century, stories of heroic survivors of Palestinian terrorism rising triumphnat over losing their limbs, or losing loved ones, or the heroic rescue of Israeli students held hostage by Palestinians terrorists at Ma'alot High School. Stories to inspire rather than discourage. Heart warming American style romantic-comedies, i.e., Knocked Up, I Love You Man, passionate love stories like the aforementioned I Love You Rosa, etc.",The Syrian Bride

That in itself is quite a reversal.The one commercial I think which totally put people off from going, one of the worst put out for a film, was the one where the character asks a woman going to the bathroom, ""is it for number one or two?""Really?

442336,"""The North Star"" is a star studded 1943 war film produced by Sam Goldwyn for RKO and written by Lillian Hellman. It was part of Roosevelt's propaganda to promote his Russian allies who were taking the brunt of the war at the time the film was made. The focus of the film is the Ukraine resistance fighters.The film stars Anne Baxter, Dana Andrews, Walter Huston, Walter Brennan, Dean Jagger, Farley Granger and Erich von Stroheim.Anne Baxter had just completed a good supporting role opposite Joseph Cotton  in Orson Welles' ""The Magnificent Ambersons"" (1942) when she got top billing for ""North Star"". After this she won the Oscar and the Golden Globe for ""The Razor's Edge"" (1946) and was nominated for an Oscar for her role as the ambitious Eve Harrington in ""All About Eve"" (1950). In 1956 she appeared as Queen Nefertiri in ""The Ten Commandments"" which is probably the peak of her career.Dana Andrews appeared in over 100 films, including memorable roles in ""The Westerner"" (1941), ""The Ox Bow Incident"" (1943), ""Laura"" (1944) and ""The Best Years of Our Lives"" (1946). He plays a young air force studentWalter Huston was churning out films in the 1930s, sometimes as many as 8 in a year. His performances were relatively undistinguished, even if some of the films (e.g., ""Gabriel Over the White House"") were hits. Huston got better as he got older, and he was nominated for an Oscar in 1937 (""Dodsworth"") and 1942 (""Devil and Daniel Webster""). The same year this film came out he was nominated again (""Yankee Doodle Dandy"") and won in 1949 for ""Treasure of the Sierra Madre"", just before he died in 1950. Huston plays the good Russian Dr. Kurin.Walter Brennan won 3 Oscars for Best Supporting Actor (""Come and Get it"" in 1936, ""Kentucky"" in 1938, and ""The Westerner"" in 1941) and was nominated for his work in ""Sergeant York"" (1941). We know him best for his Emmy nominated role in the TV series ""The Real McCoys"", and his film comedies (""The Over the Hill Gang"") or as the grumpy side kick Stumpy in ""Rio Bravo"", but he was equally capable of playing the villain, as he showed in ""The Westerner"" (1940), ""My Darling Clementine"" (1946), and again In ""How the West Was Won"" (1962). Brennan plays Karp, a peasant,  and he does such a great job that he is virtually unrecognizable, either physically or by listening for his voice.Brennan and Huston had worked together in ""Swamp Water"" (1941) where Brennan got top billing. So the chance to shoot Brennan in this film was therapeutic for Huston. Interestingly enough Huston would go on to play a similar role in ""The Dragon Seed"" (1944), this time set in China.Dean Jagger is best known for his TV role as Principal Vane in ""Mr. Novak"" for which he was twice nominated for an Emmy (1964, 1965), and for his Oscar winning role in ""Twelve O'Clock High"" (1949). He brought a grace and charm to his more than 100 roles including ""Bad Day at Black Rock"" (1955) and ""Vanishing Point"" (1971). Jagger plays a resistance leader.Erich von Stroheim plays the evil German doctor. Von Stroheim was a famous German silent film director (""Greed"", ""The Merry Widow"", ""The Lost Squadron""), but he got into too many arguments when the talkie era started, and he turned to acting. He had plenty of experience playing the evil German soldier in the silent era (""The Hun Within"", ""The Heart of Humanity"") so he transitioned easily into his role for this film. Von Stroheim is perhaps best remembered for his Oscar nominated role as the film director Max Von Mayerling in ""Sunset Blvd"" (1950).This was Farley Granger's film debut. He had a busy, if undistinguished career, appearing in more than 50 films and for awhile, as a headliner. Some of his best work was done in Hitchcock's  ""Rope"" (1948)  and ""Strangers on a Train"" (1951).Jane Withers plays Clavdia, a friend of Baxter. Withers is best known to us today as ""Josephine the Plumber"" from the commercials in the 60s and 70s, but she was, in fact, one of the most popular stars of the 30s and 40s.Carl Benton Reid plays Andrews' father, one of the resistance leaders. Reid was a great character actor. He made a big splash in his first film opposite Bette Davis in ""The Little Foxes"" (1941) and went on to appear in more than 50 films before transitioning to TV where he continued to play many parts, often a loud mayor or a heavy in a western.Martin Kosleck plays the incompetent German doctor. Kosleck was so adept at playing Nazis that he has the distinction of playing Hermann Goebbels more times than any other actor (5). A German born refugee from the Nazis, he played Goebbels for the first time in 1939 (""Confessions of a Nazi Spy"").The film was commercially and critically successful. It was nominated for 6 Oscars (Writing, Recording, Music, Cinematography, Special Effects, and Art Direction), and deservedly so. The film is beautifully shot with individual scenes that are of the same quality as GWTW.  James Wong Howe received his fourth nomination for this film, and he would receive 5 more nominations and 2 wins (""Hud"" and ""The Rose Tatoo"") in the future, making him one of the most acknowledged cinematographers in film history.The music is inspirational throughout. Aaron Copeland received his third Oscar nomination for his work, and a few years later he would win for ""The Heiress"" (1949)Lillian Hellman did the screenplay. This was her second Oscar nomination, having earned one in 1942 for ""The Little Foxes"" (in which Carl Benton Reid made his screen debut) which was adapted from her own play. Hellman's other plays include ""The Children's Hour"" (1934) and ""Toys in the Attic"" (1960). Hellman was fond of left wing causes, and her lover, famed author Dashiell Hammett was an avowed Communist Party member. Hammett and Hellman worked together on the screenplay ""Watch on the Rhine"" that starred Bette Davis and Paul Lukas.Despite the accolades, by 1947, with the winds of war changing, the film was named ""subversive"" by the HUAC, and it was heavily edited to remove the scenes which showed Russian communal farm life (in the first 30 minutes of the film) as attractive. In fact, it was re-issued as ""Armored Attack""Leaving aside the political agenda, this is a great film with strong performances from a star studded cast, beautiful photography and music, and an excellent story line. The action sequences are well done and the special effects, for 1943, are exceptional.",N/A

1342624,"""Harry Brown"" (2009)--------------------------------Note: mild spoilers below.--------------------------------A slow, deliberate pace and relentless bleakness give this English vigilante/revenge drama its tone, while the masterful Michael Caine give it gravitas and heft. The portrait of urban blight in the UK and the modern-day embrace of hedonistic, mindless violence is chilling, although ultimately the film itself tilts towards the gratuitous and grotesque, undercutting the script's emotional impact and pulling viewers out of the story. It also feels as if, perhaps, a scene or two fell onto the editing room floor that might have made the ending seem less empty: Caine's confrontation with the local baddie, a barkeep who has helped turn his neighborhood into a hellish pit, didn't have the emotional impact that the director intended. It seems implied that this character, whose Irish accent suddenly comes to the fore, may have had a background in the IRA (which would tie in with the Caine character's military training as a royal marine who learned the ways of war while deployed in Northern Ireland) but the connection seems deliberately obscured, probably for political reasons. Also, we are meant to feel betrayed when this seemingly benign figure turns on Caine, but their friendly relationship is barely explored in the start of the film; the man hardly registers as a noteworthy character, so later when the film hits its violent climax, I found myself nonplussed by the revelation. I'm just guessing, but my hunch is that there was material that made these points more forcefully, which was mistakenly taken out in the final edit.  Oh, well.Overall, this was an engaging, unsettling film with a melodramatic but probably not overly-inaccurate view of the moral and structural decay of in some British slums. Plus, you gotta love Michael Caine as a geezer with a gun.  I'd be scared of him! (Axton)",Harry Brown [Region 2]
1309265,"Jude Law as action actor? Jude Law as violence personified? Indeed, and please add a notch to his acting credentials because he is convincing in his buffed up body.Jude Law has always exuded a bit of effeminate presence, like the refined Ashley inGone with the Wind. But here, he plays a survivor of the mean streets, then a solder returned from war with nothing to do but continue his violent behavior. However, he finds the perfect job which utilizes all his skills--as a repo man. In this bleak look at a dystopian future, the medical world has landed the perfect product--retrievable and permanent body parts. Heck, sell them to anyone because if they don't pay, the part is repossessed by the Repo Man, who wears an identifying tatoo on his neck.Although the ineffable Forest Whitaker lends strong support (as always), Law still stands on his own. Frankly, I was impressed. As for Whitaker, no matter what role he accepts, he steps into it, making that character his, fleshing him out, making him real. In the story these two characters--Law and Whitaker--grow up together, playing violence for all it is worth in making them oblivious to the pain of others. The audience watches them in flashback snippets grow to the way of violence and know they are perfectly suited to steal into homes and confiscate body parts in arrears, knowing they are causing death. Too bad. They should have paid.Moral callousness aside, Law loves his son. To keep him, he must ask for a job in sales, not repossession. His wife insists on this change. Things happen (can't be a spoiler) and Law himself is given a heart. Not knowingly, not willingly, but through happenstance,  Law is given a heart. Entendre here. He has a heart and now reconsiders his job as a repo man.Of course, he gets behind in payments because he can no longer rip out organs as he once so indifferently did. It's his turn to lose his heart. More complications. His wife forces him out, he meets a singer he admires and learns that she is a conglomeration of artificial body parts. Whitaker is assigned to take his heart.That's about all I can relate without spoilers. I was so surprised by the ending. I can say, given the setting, given the characters, it is perfect. Unexpected, but perfect. I disagree with reviewers who find this a hodge-podge of story pieces, much like the singer's body. Instead, the disjointed story line and disconnected characters work together in creating a provocative world transposed from our current world of healthcare woes and mean street hardening of character. But the underlying message is hope--there's always hope as long as we are alive. But then again, the movie raises another question: What does it mean to be alive?",N/A

9910,"I never seen an animated film by Ralph Bakshi until now. I was pleasantly surprised to find American Pop such a very good film. It's the exact opposite of what you would expect in a Disney (or Pixar) film, and I don't mean it in a bad way. This is a film for adults: drugs, prostitution, poverty, politics, and bloodshed are just some things that little kids will NEVER understand. But the film also has a good story: we get to see different generations of popular music (from the late 1890's to the 1980's) seen through the eyes of a Russian-Jewish family. It's an effective story, and same goes for the stunning (and diverse) animation. Much of the animation is colorful, realistic, and at times wildly bizarre (at least in the later half of the film). The one problem I had with American Pop is that sometimes it doesn't really feel like an animated film at all. Some sections in the film (particularly scenes with extended dialogue) could have worked better if they were live-action. Still, the film is an underrated gem. The adult story, the animation, the music, the dialogue, much of the film is undeniably solid.Grade: 8/10",N/A

1293691,"Some viewers want a Michael Bay-style sucker punch to the senses, a film delivered so obtusely that interpretation becomes nearly meaningless.  Like a roller coaster, it's just about the ride.  Others prefer the intellectual or psychological, a tale that slowly develops and allows viewer imagination to dictate not only what is transpiring, but also whether or not the content is, indeed, frightening.  Given the fact Paranormal Activity falls into the latter category, I'm somewhat surprised by its relative success.Rather than taking a step ahead, PA takes a sidestep with the handheld camera concept made popular by Blair Witch Project and Cloverfield.  Avoiding too much of the rapid movements sure to induce epilepsy and migraines, PA provides a terrifying tale of a couple's cursed home.  The majority of the film is Micah talking into the video camera about a demon freeloading in the house while his girlfriend Katie self-loathingly impersonates every bad Cathy comic ever puked onto newspaper.  The only worthwhile parts are the sleeping scenes for two reasons:1)  When they are scary, they allow the viewers to anticipate and work into frenzy.2)  When they are boring, they allow the viewer to catch a quick cat-nap while Katie acts paranoid.There are a few unnerving, slowly paced scenes shot while the couple slept that could substitute for the worst insomnia commercials ever or the best advertisement for single beds in adjoining rooms in history.  Overall, however, it's just an Ouija Board clich&eacute;, which is to say that there is more meat in the marketing than on the bone.Jason Elin",N/A
1317337,"A family returns home to celebrate the birthday of their aging mother.  Their ancestral home is like a living museum, containing the works of her uncle, a celebrated painter, and of so many other important artists.  Before long, she will be gone, and she knows that the treasures she had accumulated and preserved will no longer remain intact.  It is a subtle story of a family, like all families, with things that are left unsaid but need to be spoken, with expectations that cannot possibly be fulfilled.  It is told here by Oliver Assayas with a remarkably light touch, with a beautiful palette, a fluid camera and seamless edits.  The acting is pitch-perfect throughout - it doesn't feel like acting.I couldn't help but think of this as a lighter counterpoint to the more melancholy, but more playful and inventive,A Christmas Taleby Arnaud Desplechin, whose sensibilities strike me as similar to those of Assayas - both films deal with similar issues of inheritance, of loss, of communication failures, and yet, while this film is less deliberately avant-garde than that one, it feels every bit as profound and yet more delicate, more subtle.  In addition to displaying the changes in France over generations, the film reflects on larger questions.  At what point do personal relics, a desk, a vase, a display case used as a kind of closet, become cultural artefacts?  To whom can art belong?  What is the connection between usage and display value of an artwork?

1319790,"Let me reveal right away...I'm a guy and have had my own experiences in the world I could actually call worldly. In work and play, I know how the world works, but I am always willing and eager to learn more. That said, EAT PRAY LOVE is a movie and adaptation you will either get or you don't. Either you enjoy it and appreciate it or you don't. And I am ok with that. Every movie is subjective to the viewer. With this film, it will either touch you deeply or disgust you. Let's start with touching.Not everyone is lucky enough to have experienced the pain Liz does (Julia Roberts). I say lucky because in order to grow, you must feel pain I believe. And while some people found Roberts' portrayal of Liz Gilbert trite and shallow, I found it deeply moving and an effort I could relate to. For two and a half hours, I was removed from my living room and moved along the journey of Liz through Julia Roberts. She WAS Liz and even as an actor, I think Julia Roberts was showing she is still learning about the world around her. I found her pain and sorrow and eventual growth very real. Call me what you wish, but no film needs to follow a standard formula to appeal to the masses. EAT PRAY LOVE is an interpretation of the artist and this film clicks on all cylinders.As for the disgusting part that some people label the entire film, I think perhaps they expect too much from movies and actors. To jettison the world around you as you sit in a movie theater or living room takes a talent many don't have. The message of this film and its characters is to let yourself go and create an open minded approach and view to the world around you and the world within you. Not everyone can do that and I am ok with that too. But call it what you will, EAT PRAY LOVE is an adoring look at one person's life among many. You will feel the energy and beauty of it or you won't. I applaud the filmmakers and actors for an escape that even men can, not should, appreciate. It's not just a chick flick, it's a snapshot of one person's life that is far from shallow. It is a moving journey indeed.",Eat Pray Love

1308049,"I just want to say I'm reviewing the movie itself here, not the DVD or Blu-ray since they are not yet released at the time of this writing, nor will I buy or rent the home video version of this stinker. I saw ""Predators"" on the Sunday night of it's opening weekend back in July and the stench of this lousy movie is still fresh in my mind. The original Predator is a terrific sci-fi action thriller. It's loud and dumb and full of macho dudes with huge guns tearing up the jungle. No one has ever mistaken Predator for an intelligent film. At the same time, Arnold's action vehicle remains one of the most emimently watchable pieces of pop culture cinema from the 1980s. It's been 23 long years since the first flick came out and I can't count how many times I've seen the film because it's really fun and easy to watch. Memorable location photography, fun characters, intense action and one great villian from outer space. Not that the first film was in any way original or groundbreaking, it was billed as ""Rambo"" meets ""Alien"". That's how it was sold and it worked like magic even though the critics mostly panned it. A lot of kids grew up on that movie, including me. Well those kids are now making movies of their own and here comes ""Predators"", the hamfisted quasi-remake-sequel thing to the original classic sci-fi monster movie. The people behind this new movie have probably immersed themselves in the Predator movies, videogames and comic books. Appearantly nothing good has come of it, because this movie plays like a endless in-joke between fans of the series. It has zero integrity or ideas of it's own.I saw the trailers to Predators and I was enthusiastic about it. Depressed over the miserable Predator 2 with Danny Glover and absolutely disgusted by how pathetic the Alien vs Predator flicks were, I had some hope that the filmmakers were finally ready to set things right. Robert Rodriguez was involved, not as director, but that's ok. The director was Nimrod Antal and he did the effective little movie ""Vacancy"". The trailers were terrific. The Predators kidnap a bunch of human mercenaries and assassins, take them to the Predator home planet and hunt them on that turf. Great set up! Plus we finally get a jungle/forest atmosphere instead of L.A. or Antarctica ( ridiculous ).I was going to go see this new film with a friend but I found out he had never seen the original movie! Yes, there are still men out there who have not seen that absolute essential classic of macho cinema. We rented the original movie the night before and watched it. Everyone was entertained, even me who has seen it countless times before. Then the next night, we head off to the movie theater. Talk about deja vu. There are entire sequences lifted from the original. Beyond the return of the memorable score, ( which I didn't mind at all ), there was that waterfall scene all over again, there was the Billy makes a stand scene regurgitated with a Yakuza gangster. It went on and on. The big ideas of this insipid film were things like C.G.I. Predator dogs, two different Predator races and Laurence Fishburne in a pointless cameo apperance.The cast was in no way memorable. Adrien Brody does a lot of grunting but seeing him go toe to toe with the biggest, meanest, toughest alien was silly. Even Arnold was wiped out but Brody can handle things? Absurd nonsense. The other characters had little to no personality. Compare this lame squad with the likes of Carl Weathers, Jesse Ventura, Bill Duke and Sonny Landham. And what about the chick with the big gun ( Alice Braga )? Does every action film need a chick with a gun? Finally... Topher Grace, the dork from ""That 70s Show"", doing his annoying schtick yet again. It's all a bit too much. The writing is subpar to say the least, the dramatic tension that one so desperately needs in a sci-fi thriller is completely non-existent. I didn't care about the fate of any character in the entire movie. The Predator mythology is barely expanded at all, we just find out that there is more than one race of predators and that they are at war with each other. Nothing more about the planet, it's history or anything. Brody just tells the audience, ""This planet is a game reserve and we're the game."" How does he know that? How did he figure that out in 15 minutes after just waking up in a sky diving freefall? Well, he doesn't know jack, it's just the poor mechanics of the screenplay that are working themselves out to give the audience information.I could go on and trash this hapless film for all it's worth as a way of retribution for getting me into the movie theater and taking my money but I'll leave things on a good note. This movie is much better than the awful Alien vs Predator movies. At the same time, never did I imagine that I would actually think of Predator 2 as a decent film but man, that stupid sequel from 1990 is light years ahead of Predators. That sequel embellished the mythology, pumped up the action and the violence and had crazy Gary Busey, wild man Bill Paxton and of course Danny Glover.Predators is a poor sequel and does nothing to add to the mystery of this venerable movie monster. It's a decent little midnight movie when you're alone at home with nothing to do before going to bed. That's the best I can say about it. I wish it was much better but it can't be when money and exploiting a lucrative property are the sole motives for this film's existence.",Predators
1519928,"This new franchise of 'Tokyo Erotique' from Cinema Epoch is quickly becoming the benchmark for Asian soft core exploitation. The first two volumes of 'Tokyo Train Girls' are destined to become classics, and should be required viewing for all cult enthusiasts and sleazehounds alike.The first volume, 'Private Lessons', opens with a 23 year-old teacher setting up a online webcam chat room to help pay off debts accrued while partying and getting her teaching degree. She flashes herself, paying special attention to her natural ample breasts (she'd be suitable in an early Russ Meyer film before he started using surgically enhanced side-show freaks during the 70's), coaxing and teasing her fan base seductively.She teaches a class of underachieving seniors, but if I had teachers who looked and dressed like that, I'd have never learned a damned thing either. The female lead has long legs, wears tight skirts and is capable of keeping our attention. Little does she know that one of her pupils has ID'ed her by a necklace that she wears to class, and has become sexually fixated with her. A new twist on the 'Hot For Teacher' theme. Bravo.Now we come to the staple in this series, the mandatory train molestation scenes, which bring a new element to our deviant enjoyment. Who rides public transportation daily and hasn't had a similar thought at one time or another? (Naturally, we don't succumb to these urges so we avoid jail time as well as getting molested ourselves while in jail...). But I digress - these train gropings are some of the high points of the series, long and licentious, a pervert's paradise, a Garden of Eden for the fondler's edification and enlightenment. This is one of those times when low-budget shot-on-video works remarkably well, literally bringing us into each frame of celluloid filth. Hallelujah.Another staple in the series is the fly-on-the-wall shower scenes that make you envious of soap. Seeing the actresses all lathered up for our amusement is one of life's simple pleasures indeed. It should be noted that are twice as many sex scenes in these flicks than in any other series I've seen, and I'm both proud and ashamed to admit how many those are, and the scenes are lengthy and realistic for soft-core erotica, and among the best you'll find anywhere. The keywords 'Abundant Female Nudity' don't even begin to describe the flesh-feast here. No joke.I won't give more of the details away, but I will highly recommend the first two volumes in this series to all of my brethren who found themselves here reading this - the third volume was weakest of the four, and the fourth was good as well. Read my reviews for all four volumes for details. All aboard!!!",Tokyo Train Girls 1: Private Lessons

No extras, no subtitles, and only a basic chapter-selection menu.It is advertised as ""new""... and I supposed that may be technically true, to the extent that it isn't ""used"". ""New"" in the sense that after the disc emerged from the DVD-burner, it got put it in a case and shrink-wrapped without anyone watching it first, even in the interest of basic quality control. Not usually what one thinks of when buying a ""new"" DVD.The black and white sleeve art appears to be a scan of a 1989 Congress Video Group VHS edition (hence that ""CV"" logo on the front). There is even a customer service number of ""1-800-VHS-TAPE"" on the rear of this ""new"" ""DVD"" sleeve...SO... if you really MUST have a copy of this film, don't want to spring for the pricier, out-of-print Dead of Night/Queen of Spades double-feature, and don't mind a dodgy transfer on a DVD-R, go for it.UPDATE: Looks like they've modified the sleeve art from the description I posted above (perhaps trying to disguise the crappy product...?)",Dead of Night VHS

This is a very important lesson for kids and adults alike to learn, and it is shown here with all the problems and challenges faced in learning the lesson: bullying by others who want you to be a certain way, rather than accepting you as you are; claptrap psycho-babble also focused on making you someone you aren't; people complaining about you not accepting yourself while they go about not accepting themselves first; and the value of having a variety of talents and gifts in the world.

1328916,"To be honest, I was first attracted to this film because I'm from The Bronx, I'm Italian and my dad worked for many many years on City Island (let's see, that would make him a Clam Digger, no? Or is he a Mussel Sucker? Hmmm... Tough one.). The other reason is I'm a big fan of Director Raymond De Felitta, who also directed one of my favorite films - Two Family House. City Island focuses on the dysfunctional family of a corrections officer played by Andy Garcia. The problem I had with all the dysfunction was I wasn't able to identify the root causes of said dysfunction. And there was an overkill of dysfunction so that some superfluous dysfunction took away from really important dysfunction. Let me explain. From the beginning, the main dysfunction is apparent: a man with both a dream and marital strife. But there is also child/parent dysfunction, quirks, secrets, abandonment and anger. One problem: we don't know why - not a lot of back story. Andy Garcia's character wants to be an actor and tells his wife he's gambling so that he can go to an acting class which fuels her animosity toward him. It's not clear how they got to that point (keeping your dreams secret is one thing but choosing a lie that fuels anger seemed off to me). While he's at his corrections job and out at acting class, his wife is getting angrier and angrier, the two kids are coming apart at the seams (daughter flunks out of college and can't tell her own uneducated parents she has a problem with school so she becomes a stripper; son inexplicably subscribes to a chubby chaser's website and gets turned on by watching a morbidly obese woman gorging round the clock). In the meantime, Andy Garcia learns that his ""secret son"" from a previous relationship has been transferred to his jail and arranges to take the inmate home to live with the family - work in exchange for jail time. I found that part of the story a little hard to believe. So now we have the core story line which is the man with a secret dream and his lying and scheming to achieve the dream. Then, we have the disgruntled, angry wife story, daughter as stripper story, son as chubby chaser story, secret son from a previous relationship story and if that's not enough, our main character is developing a relationship with a woman from his acting class and she has a story of her own. It's too much at times and for a film with so much, there are actually some surprisingly slow sections that drag on and on and on.The good news is, if you hang on until the last half hour, you'll be satisfied with the ending (I won't spoil that here). I found some of the stories distracting, particularly the son's chubby chasing activity which was quite a disconnect from the type of background the kid came from. There really were no satisfactory explanations or repercussions regarding that behavior which goes against everything I know about Italian families from The Bronx. And trust me, I know Italian families from The Bronx.Of this film and Two Family House, I'll have to say I prefer Two Family House because there was a heart to that film which carried through and you could feel the trials, tribulations and longings of the main character deeply and profoundly. The themes in Two Family House were more universal and relate-able - themes like honesty, loss and singing your own song even if nobody else sings along (kinda literally). In City Island, there are so many distractions from the main story, there are times when you lose sight of the man with the dream. It comes through in the end but there are moments when he fades into the background and you aren't sure why you're even there.It is through the skill of the actors this film actually pulls through. And thankfully so.",N/A

108946,"Turner Classic Movies' classic movie series continues with this two-disc set showcasing four beloved films with romantic themes. Intriguingly, while two movies have the requisite happy ending, the other two close with former lovers resigned to the wisdom gained from relationships that could not endure. All four have been presented in pristine print condition.Splendor in the Grass(****1/2): Director Elia Kazan was able to extract a searing performance from Natalie Wood in this classic 1961 melodrama about youthful sexual repression in rural 1920's Kansas. She has never been more affecting then she is here as Deanie Loomis, the local butcher's daughter deeply in love with Bud Stamper, the son of an oil scion and the high school football hero. They are the senior sweethearts everyone expects to marry, but both have to battle constantly with their sexual longing and their grasping parents.While the whole film is beautifully executed thanks to Kazan's sure hand and William Inge's screenplay (his first directly for the screen), it's the last fifteen minutes that really resonate with the characters expressing their emotions with a minimum of dialogue. At her most youthfully beautiful, Wood is wondrous as she moves fluidly from innocently infatuated to obsessive to resigned. As the none-too-bright Bud, Warren Beatty is charismatic in his film debut and makes Deanie's powerful fixation completely understandable. The classic Wordsworth poem from which the film's title is derived makes a fitting coda for this movie, and I still feel the intractable sense of longing in the two lead characters every time I see this movie. The 2009 DVD offers the original theatrical trailer and a familiar 1961 Roadrunner cartoon short, ""Beep Prepared"".Love in the Afternoon(****): There is likely no more romantic ending to a Hollywood movie than the one in this souffl&eacute;-light 1957 romantic comedy, where Audrey Hepburn tries to keep up with a departing train upon which Gary Cooper stands and listens intently to her babbling about her fictitious sexual conquests. Hepburn plays Ariane, a young cellist and the daughter of a Parisian private investigator named Claude Chevasse. She has an unbridled interest in her father's often tawdry cases, chief among them the affairs of Frank Flannagan, a millionaire industrialist and aging playboy who finds himself in various trysts with married women around the world. They embark on a clandestine affair under the pretense that she is as much a worldly bon vivant as he is.Things come to a head when Flannagan becomes infatuated with this mysterious ""thin girl"" and recruits Crevasse to find out who she is. Film master Billy Wilder leaves his unmistakable stamp on this confection with a clever, ironic script co-written with his long-time partner I.A.L. Diamond in their first collaboration. The dialogue is full of their trademark sparkling banter. Hepburn is her usual impeccable self as Ariane. Cooper played this type of boulevardier role in the 1930's under masters like Ernst Lubitsch, and it is quite enjoyable to see him come back to this milieu two decades later as an aging lothario. Maurice Chevalier is ideally cast as Crevasse even if he has to play down his naturally effervescent manner. Granted the film runs a little too long at 126 minutes, but it is fine, light entertainment. The print transfer on the bare-bones 2005 DVD is fine though not outstanding.Mogambo(****): Ava Gardner could hardly be considered anyone's second choice, but this is what director John Ford and screenwriter John Lee Mahin would have you believe in this overripe 1952 safari melodrama. Yet, she is the primary reason why this film is still worth a look 56 years later, epitomizing a primal sensuality and a hidden vulnerability, the combination of which was intoxicating in her prime. Ford captures this, as well as her dark beauty and sharp comedy sense, by casting her as smart-mouthed, carefree playgirl Eloise ""Honey Bear"" Kelly, who has come to a remote African outpost to meet up with a wealthy maharajah.Finding herself stood up, she is greeted by no-nonsense big game hunter Victor Marswell as she conveniently takes a shower al fresco. Looking the patrician beauty that served her well during her brief movie career, a 24-year-old Grace Kelly plays a prudish English wife in starchy, melodramatic fashion. As Marswell, the 52-year-old Clark Gable still shows his enduring appeal, but he really hands the picture to Gardner. Ford handles the exotic background as well as he does Monument Valley in his classic westerns, and the look of the film is sumptuous even by MGM's high standards. The only extra with the 2006 DVD is the original theatrical trailer.Now, Voyager(****): Let's face it - this 1942 Warner Bros film classic is a hoot. Directed by journeyman studio veteran Irving Rapper, it's an unabashed, only-in-Hollywood soap opera with Bette Davis at the peak of her popularity as she evolves from a distraught, overweight spinster to a glamorous Boston society social maven in about ten minutes. It's also a big valentine to the positive effects of psychoanalysis, as the plot focuses on heiress Charlotte Vale, a walking disaster of sheltered neurosis. Her sister-in-law contacts a doctor who convinces Charlotte to seek psychiatric treatment at a posh sanitarium. Transformed by the experience, she finds romance with architect Jerry Durrance, who is married to an unstable woman.Overcome with guilt, Charlotte returns to the sanitarium, where she meets troubled young Tina, who turns out to be Jerry's daughter. In what amounts to a showcase for her versatility, Davis is superb in both before and after modes, even playing a romantic shipboard teenager with sincerity in a flashback sequence. Paul Henried plays Jerry with requisite Continental charm, but he is truly overmatched by Davis in their scenes together. Claude Rains fares better in the pivotal role of Dr. Jaquith providing his medical advice with convincing paternal authority and genuine warmth. Gladys Cooper portrays Charlotte's iron-willed mother in a sharply uncompromising manner befitting the intimidating stature she holds in the family. The print condition on the 2005 DVD is excellent, though there are no other extras included.",N/A

But now I know that even if it didn't, it would still be a worthwhile film to see. It deals with serious issues, and tells the story of Tyler whose parents are divorced, and whose dad has provided everything materially, but has never been there emotionally for him or his younger sister. Tyler is somewhat reckless, who lets his temper get the best of him at times, which ultimately gets him into trouble.  It deals with family tragedy, the bullying of his little sister at school, his falling in love, and just basically his relationships with everyone he knows. It makes you think, and realize to value the time you have with those you love.  I recommend seeing it.",N/A

991286,"Alright, so coming off the high that was Season 1, we dive into Season 2. Unfortunately, like any other sophomore season, this show has a LOT of growing pains, and they're very evident. Sure, we get a lot more mystery, but most of the events of this season are virtually erased by the middle of Season 3. But don't worry, Lost is about characters, not story, right? Yeah, but they frustratingly can get much right there this season.Highlight Episodes:Man of Science, Man of FaithThe Other 48 DaysOne of ThemLockdownLive Together, Die AloneAlright, so we do get a lot of great moments in the Hatch, and we do get to know the Tailies, but by season's end, most of the Tailies are dead, and the hatch is blown up. The mystery certainly did its job, but in retrospect, it was kind of for nothing, besides a few character building moments. Which brings me to the Flashbacks. These moments in the first season often gave us insight into the characters, but in season two, they mostly tell us what we already know, and a lot of them feel just straight-up pointless and not enjoyable. Sure, they're useful when first meeting the Tailies, but that's about it.Then there's the crime this season commits against its characters. By the end of the first season, we had grown to love these characters, and while they weren't always likable, they had a good reason to be so. This season however, it seems the Island has a tendency to just make everybody annoying/jerky. Basically Sawyer, Sayid & Locke are untouched by this rampage of bad turns with characters, but that's because they align with who they were last season. I can't say as much for the rest of the characters. Jack becomes increasingly more irrational/annoying when he goes he becomes more of a roguish leader shaped by the harsh reality of the Island. Kate isn't given that much to do, but between love-triangles & more irrationality, she became annoying very quickly. Michael wasn't there for most of the season, and he was just trying to get his son back, but I found him more frustrating and just being in the way of the action I actually cared about to care about his predicament, or even try to justify his actions, since they were completely irrational. Sun & Jin took way too long to get where they were going in their personal journeys.And then there was Charlie. My god, what did the producers/writers do to Charlie? There was simply no reason to bring back the heroin storyline with him, and they just made him into a pompous jerk bent on being a smart-ass & nothing more. There was simply no reason to do this, and again, the Writers spent a LONG time after that to get the guy to become likable again, and it just barely worked because it reminded us of the Charlie of Season 1, since Charlie of Season 2 was a douche. I also wasn't a fan of Claire, since she became the new Shannon, ala annoying screaming girl, who I just lost all physical attraction for. And again, most of her actions are not rational in any sense of the word.But, for all that Season 2 does wrong with the characters, it does introduce us to the wonder that is Michael Emerson & Desmond Hume. Henry Gale/Ben Linus just makes for such a perfect foil of John Locke, and his character is just so compelling, even though you don't know a single thing about him. His expressions, his actions, every word he speaks and doesn't speak is absolutely spell-binding. And even though Desmond Hume is only in the Season a grand total of 2 or 3 episodes, the character is fascinating on every level, and does the most with his short time.Overall, the story is compelling and a lot of interesting stuff is raises, the Season suffers from a grand sense of pointlessness, and what it does to the characters that we fell in love with just a season before, is almost unforgivable. They may have Lost their way, but at least there's enough good elements here to find yourself getting through the Season, on to bigger and better stuff.",Lost - The Complete Second Season

Much, much different then the orignal but was still a good movie.  Rob made Myers more human and more savage.Now to the remake of the second Halloween.  Well I truly do not know where to begin. Well let start with the good points.1) The voilence- it is truly stepped up a notch here.  Not gore but the violence. Itreally seemed to fit this Myers.  He is no longer thisboogieman type character but a sadistic brutal killer.2) Myers - Though I still like the original better this one is still great.  He'sdifferent.  Most will either love him or hate him not to many in themiddle.3) Dreams - We got to see what was driving Myers, what was going on in his head.Now what was bad1)Dr. Loomis -  Man does this Loomis really suck.  I mean the original really  helped make the movies. With out him the movie would have weakened greatly.  This Loomis nearly destroy's the movie.2) Dreams - I can't really go into this to much without giving some things up but lets just say there to many of them and they should have been limited to Myers.All in all I would like to have given 2 1/2 stars.  I think it would not be out of the question to give it a 3 star but that would be stretching it.  If Rob would just have had a better Loomis this movie would have been soooo much better.",N/A

They will lose market share of these older TV series from the 70s and 80s.I have all of Magnum PI and The A Team and a bunch of 80s shows, as I am 42 now i was a teenager when these shows were on in New Zealand in the early 80s and loved them , but when talking to someone who is in there teens about them they look at you like you are from another planet when you mention these shows to them.We have a big discount store here called The Warehouse they had The Brady Bunch all five seasons of them on special they did go quick but i looked at the people buying them and they must have been in there late 50s early 60s so i think in the end there will be less and less of people buying these older shows.So the beancounters at Sony , CBS and all the other studios that have the rights to these older shows you guys need to get off your backsides and release the rest of these classic shows as in a few years there will be no one left to buy them.And I tell you what drives me bananas is this Vol 1 with 12 episodes on it which is normally half a season being released at a time for a outrageous price,  this is just ripping people off , the whole season guys or don't bother about it.",Fantasy Island - The Complete First Season

1322002,"First let me say that I am one of those people who can fall upstairs.  Trees and rocks have been know to find me when I walk or ride a bike.  I also live in Kansas, the FLAT part of Kansas.  This means that going down a snow covered hill very fast has no appeal to me. All this made it hard for me to get excited about the movie FROZEN.  I teach  film studies and our next assignment was to be a film critic.  We discussed the duties of a film critic and so on, so I decided to use this film as the film for them to review.  Since the film had a very short run in theatres and hadn't been seen by the kids, I thought it would be a great one for them to use.  The bottem line is this I found myself watching the film closer looking at how it was made,ie. camera angles, music, set, fx, and watching the reactions of my students.It was a new experience for me, I was taking notes in the dark about the movie on one pad and notes about the kids' reaction on another pad.  Thank Heaven the movie was only 93 minutes long.First thing I noticed was that I didn't ""click"" with the characters.  Their opening dialogue seemed strained and fake.  The male friend compaining to his buddy that the girl was taking away from their guy time just fell flat.  Now if I can not find something in the characters to like then I have no emotional reason to care what happens to them.  This first part got a chuckle and snickering from the kids.  It seemed that a lot time was taken in the first part of the movie at talking about feelings and the male friend finding a girl.  I know that the scene where the boys ""make"" the girl get the lift guy to let them on is a set up for later, but this scene and the way the guys ""shamed"" the girl into doing it seemed sleazy.The dialogue is the main thing that ""killed"" this mvoie.  For example, when they first realize that they are trapped on the lift, what do they talk about?  The different ways to die!  Another time is when the boyfriend is spread out on the ground with his legs 90 degrees from his body with a bone sticking out of his leg, what do they say?  Are you alright?  The effect is one of out and out laughter by the kids.  This mistake underminds  the guy on the ground and what is about to happen to him.  The two in the lift don't just ask this stupid questin once but several times even when the wolves are busy with the boy friend.The music does nothing to help the movie.  The back ground music is classical in nature and does not fit what is happening on the screen.  I found myself aware it when I should have been paying attentin to the movie.I may not ski but I do known about snow and cold and so do my students.  This was judged to be the greatest mistake of all in the movie.  The movie takes place at night  during bad snow snow storm and we all noticed the following things:1.  When the characters talked, the was no puffs of ""smoke"" that would be there if warm breath met cold air.2.  At first when they were trapped and the night turned into a blizzard they didn't shiver.3.  The scene when the male friend tries to climb the cable that there was no ice on it.  There was ice on everything else but not here.4.  They didn't try to huddle for warmth.  Come on now.5.  There is a wind and their clothes don't move in it.6.  The girl is the only one to get frost bite.  Why?But not all was bad.  The director of the movie, Adam Green, also did the movie Hachet.  My kids said this was gross horror mvoie and they liked it.  The scene where the boyfriend jumps is the one scene we watched two or three times because the first part and first reaction was the strongest part of the mvoie.  We noticed that this was well done at first.  The kids said oh the blood but there wasn't any.  The director wisely stage this in such away that the kids' imagination added to the scene what wasn't there.  this was very effective.  But on second viewing things began to come out.  One was why didn't the guy faint?  When looking at the position of the guy the second time the kids noticed that the body and the legs were not in proportion  and at wrong angles.The action scenes are well done and exciting.  The kids responded to these.  It was the parts in between that they hated.  And this is the director's fault.  He also worte the film.The end!!!!!  Well I can not repeat the words that the kids said about the end.  they felt that they had spent 93 minutes of exciting action and dumb dialogue and they got that ending!  I don't even want to tell you the ending.So I would not rent this movie.

Initially the guys loathe Jen and vice versa, but gradually they start to appreciate one another.""The IT Crowd: Seasons 1, 2 & 3"" has a few bumps in the road (""The Haunting of Bill Crouse"" way overextends some of its jokes) but is overall a pretty solid sitcom -- think a more farcical version of ""The Office"" with a dash of ""The Mighty Boosh."" It even has Noel Fielding as the supremely freaky goth that lives down in the basement like a vampire (for the first two seasons).And it's got some great running jokes like Douglas Reynholm's (""I don't think I've ever looked in this drawer... WOW, a gun!"") and the idiots who call IT because their computers are unplugged. But each episode has its own running gags: toe-deforming shoes, ""manly"" behavior, flaming bras, erotic calendars and Douglas offending the top five major world religions. And the dialogue is a big oozing bundle of hilarity (""I'm going to strain my personal potatoes throughout her premises!"").The core three actors are all brilliant at their very different characters -- Parkinson (who looks like a slapstickier version of Gillian Anderson) is wonderful as a pathological liar and girly-girl with the worst office on Earth. O'Dowd is deliciously sloppy and resentful about the way the rest of the employees treat him (a necessary evil), and Ayoade is gloriously monotonic and clueless about real life.It has a couple weak episodes, but ""The IT Crowd: Seasons 1, 2, and 3"" is the funniest Britcom in years -- and thankfully, it's still going strong.",N/A
530545,"In my opinion The Sopranos is the best show that has ever been created. The Wire is a very close second but The Sopranos remainsthe most entertaining show to watch, just as much now as when it originally aired. My true test of a great show or movie is how longit can remain relevant and enjoyable and The Sopranos is still very strong. The blu ray is decent, about as good as this season is evergoing to look and sound. It is much better than the standard definition DVD but cannot compare to both parts of the sixth season thatwere released earlier. Much of the problem is with the original source material and cannot be changed so I give it a four out of five starranking. Certain scenes have way to much grain and the lighting is on and off in certain scenes, again, all present on the now ancient DVD.About the only thing that I can find wrong with the blu ray PQ is edge enhancement which although noticeable in many scenes never reallydistracted me too much. The sound is great, a very noticeable upgrade. Just like most HBO releases there are very few extra materials. Overallthis is a solid high definition release of the fabulous beginning to my favorite show of all time and arguably one of the best shows ever made.",N/A

And because ""Monte"" was missing from DVD catalogues all these years, I thought I was the only one to recognize the beauty of this ""forgotten"" film. Now, after seeing the rave reviews here, I was way wrong. Ha! My favorite scene has to be with Chet and Monte dozing on the porch, and Chet gives Monte the devastating news that not only is he getting married, but that he is thru being a cowboy...man..listening to that music score makes this scene a real killer.And then there is the opening scene with Mama Cass singing the theme song...and while your at it..you can throw in the scene in ""Charleyville"" where Monte ""rides down the grey"".

379251,"This is most likely the seminal piece of work that thoroughly portrays the life of Her Majesty, Queen Elizabeth I.  Although none of alive knows what Elizabeth sounded like, acted like, or even looked like (other than from paintings that may or may not have been accurate), Glenda Jackson is Queen Elizabeth.  Her portrayal of the Monarch in Mary Queen of Scots is also incredible.  (It is nearly impossible to distinguish between her in either work because they were shot at about the same time, unless one actually views the work for a while.)Because the work (as opposed to Mary, Queen of Scots) was filmed for television, the sets are a bit dry.  Also, as it is supposed to be, it comes off as a theater piece, i.e., as a play.  The costumes are excellent, and the acting just cannot get better.The ""bonus features"" are also very interesting.  The A&E; Biography of Glenda Jackson was excellent.  I had not realized that she had become a Member of Parliament in the 1990s, and I believe she still remains an MP.

This is one of them and. While not as interesting as The Boys - The Sherman Brothers Story - its still highly recommended.This is not a ""whitewashed"" story or promo for the Disney company. There were serious personality differences at the corporate level with Eisner, Katzenberg, Wells and Roy E. Disney. And all the warts are shown. At most times you'd think that Michael Moore or someone outside the Disney organization produced and released this film. Not Disney it self. And that gives it ""street cred"". Then there are the great home movies from 1975b with Pixar's John Lassiter and the incredible Director Tim Burton as Disney animators.Director Don Hahn didn't want :""talking heads"" throughout the film so he uses ""voice balloons"" to let you know who is talking. BUT - and this is the only weakness in the production, and not mentioned elsewhere - the text is white on a YELLOW background and VERY (if not impossible) to read. I'm not deducting a star here, though I considered it. The film is too important not to give it five stars.As noted by others, the bonuses are as good as the 86-minute film.The film did play in some film festivals but - even if you saw it - you need the DVD.This DVD will probably not get heavy promotion by Disney but its one of the most important release from them this year.Next up for me is Walt and El Grupo, the third in this wonderful group of releases from Disney.Steve Ramm""Anything Phonographic""",N/A

1342544,"To put it simply, this release is just remarkable.  Filming, set list, editing, sound, it is all near perfect.What is incredible is the very beginning, during the Intro.  It gives you the sense and anticipation of actually being at the show.  For a minute of two of film, it does a great job of putting you there, not just in front of a television screen.The rise of Blu-ray has most certainly changed the atmosphere of watching a concert on television.  You no longer feel as separated, instead you feel a lot more involved and the production of this disc does nothing to spoil that.The set list is great.  The entire Fear of a Blank Planet suite performed together and then Nil Recurring with mostly Signify and In Abstenia songs mixed in.  I remember seeing a concert with mostly this set list and Dark Matter itself was worth the price of admission.  The only thing I missed was at my show, they did The Sky Moves Sideways, but truly, one can't expect everything.  That was such a treat though.The sound is perfect and is nothing short of what Porcupine Tree fans expect to hear from a Steven Wilson project. Crystal clear and very dynamic.  And of course, the band never misses a note.I purchased the Gray Special Edition through PT's site and am glad to have the CD's from this concert.  If you like rock music, and have never heard of the band, this may not be a bad starting point to get the point across about how legendary this group is.  The concert and Blu-ray production is nothing short of amazing and is a good representation as to the quality of this band.",N/A
1275338,"This is one of the best teen movies I have seen in a while.  It reminds me ofBrickbut a much better version.  The lead character, Funke, is wildly original and rings true.  Other characters are more stereotypical but still interesting and even funny.Basically, this is a story about trying to climb the high school social ladder.  An average guy (Funke) tries to leave his mark as he shoots for the prestigious Northwestern summer internship for journalism.  When his theory about who stole the SAT tests gets published in his private school's newspaper, all heck breaks loose. Funke wins the bid for the internship as long as the fact checker from Northwestern gives the green light.  The fact checker's introduction pushes the movie into high gear as Funke needs to get to the real truth of his story or risk his bright and shiny future.We find Bruce Willis as an over-the-top Principal who loves to relive his military days and he's funny yet creepy and might offend some. The love interest is Mischa Barton and we all know how this is going to end, even Funke although he desperately tries to avoid it.  Although most of the characters are classic high school stereotypes, it works for this film as we can all identify with Funke's plight.  This movie touched on all the different social classes you will find at school: the kids who are popular, the kids who hang around popular kids and those who are not even part of the social scene.  I really liked that the actor playing Funke looked real (his hair was sticking out sometimes, his skin was spotty, etc.) and not Hollywood perfect.I highly recommend this film for watching something different.  It was amusing.  This movie did not unravel at the end like so many others I have watched recently and made a good point about high school.",N/A

1188931,"The first few episodes of this show I was not so sure I liked it to much. Well I did like it but I like most anything with vampires in it, but all in all the show seamed to me to try to hard to be shocking and cool (and doing this by having characters have sex all the time) not that I mind sex or even graphic sex in a TV show or movie but when there is several long sex scenes in about every episode I start wondering why I did not just pick up a porn movie in the first place. However a little bit into the season the show do get better, the storyline and the characters pick up.The show have some very good and interesting characters, and some who are not so much. The premise of the show is that a few years into the future vampires have stepped forward and declared their presence. They have now become a part of society, partly due to the fact that they drink tru blood, artificial blood. Society is in an uproar over the vampires, some welcoming them and some wanting them hunted down and killed. In some way the show is similar to Alienation in that you have these supernatural creatures which try to become a part of society but there is forces working against that both in human society and inside the supernatural society. Now as often happens in these vampire shows one of the undead fall in love with a human girl. In this case a psychic blond redneck named Sookie. The show is about these two and their relationship as well as the pepole around them and their reactions to vampires suddenly being a part of society.I found True Blood to be an enjoyable show. I however do think that it at times is to redneck and try to hard to be trashy. At times I would love to see a character who do not live in a trailer or a house so run down it is surprising it do not fall a part and who actually have a bit off class. But I do not know, perhaps it is just me being snobby.

Those of us who are familiar, know that these are a full body workout and intense. The hip work movement is challenging and designed to strengthen as it is layered on releve and plie.Seated moving meditation follows with upper body circular and undulating movement,and leg extensions.Arm work segment follows with intricate weaving and torso involvement. The arms are articulated at every joint and the result is elegant and sinuous. I felt this section moved too fast and will have to repeat it several times.Tutorial and Combo for all four elements:Air, Fire, Water, Earth: Each element is represented in different combos. The movement here is far from classical belly dance! Here Sera Solstice elaborates the trendy and cutting edge styles of industrial, and hip hop fused seamless ly with belly dance in Sera style, which is her remarkable talent. The combos are danced by Sera and dancers with ample repetitions, and followed with step by step demonstrations, taught by Sera. A great bonus is the practice flow segments. These follow with a lovely cool down and closing with Sera and dancers.Performances: 2 solo performances by Sera;1 by Sera and Solstice Ensemble-too rich for common words!Anyone with entry level fundamentals may venture into this program with infectious enthusiasm and work hard to attain the goals that this program inspires.

1286823,"Have you ever seen one of those previews for a film that made it seem as if it was the greatest idea in the world? All the flash and bang, all the explosions, all the quick quips that make it seem exciting and witty and worth your money to see? But then when you see the film you realize that all the best parts were spliced together in such a way that the preview was more entertaining than the actual movie? Such is the case with GAMER.In the future mega whiz Ken Castle (Michael C. Hall) is a computer genius who has created two games that everyone plays. The first is recognizable as a Sims style game but with a difference. Volunteers have had nanobytes placed in their brains that allow them to be controlled by game players to do their bidding. This includes everything from standing on their head to having sex. The nanobytes also give the game players the opportunity to view all that goes on.The second game, Slayers, is a more adventurous one. In this one, the nanobytes have been implanted on prisoners sitting on death row. Game players control these people in a dangerous setting, each armed with real weapons as they make their way to a goal through high powered obstacles placed in their way. Their objective is to play the game out and win so many times and in return the player (or prisoner in this case) is granted his or her freedom.As the film begins Kable (Gerard Butler) is the most popular of the pieces in play. Simon (Logan Lerman) is Kable's controller/game player and the duo has gone further than any others in the game. Kable is nearing the chance to be free but of course the powers that be can't have that (shades of ROLLERBALL!). Instead the rig the game to make sure he loses.But Kable has a plan of his own. Via flashbacks we get a glimpse of the life he led before, some of which he can recall but not everything. Kable has a family and a life he misses and somehow Castle was involved in taking it away. Not until a final confrontation are we privy to what that connection is.Along the way we get to see Kable's wife Angie (Amber Alleta) as she plays the Sims style game as a pawn for an overweight slob who controls her into some seriously strange situations. Those involved in this game seem intent on displaying the most depraved situations everywhere. Of course, this is graphically viewed by anyone watching this DVD. Suffice to say gratuitous nudity for the sake of gratuitous nudity is on hand.Another plot line involves rebels out to take down Castle and his plans at world domination via game players and nanobytes. They interfere with Kable and Simon in the hopes that Kable will survive no matter what is thrown at him and then have the chance to find Castle.So what about the movie as a whole? It's quite disappointing with many of the action sequences the preview promoted short and far between. The plot seems thin at best and copied from various other films in the past at worst. The pacing is slow, the set up lame and the payoff predictable from early on.The acting in this film is standard with no outstanding performances. Those involved offer little or no emotion, seeming more like the characters seen in video games that they discuss. Even Butler, who I think is becoming a better actor as he goes, offers nothing that makes this one something to seek out.The effects take center stage here, most notably the camerawork. So much so that one of the main extra features discusses the camera system they used to get the look they wanted. If you've seen either CRANK film (by the same directors) you know the look I'm talking about. But while that film offered many tongue in cheek moments, this one just doesn't match up to the promises made in the previews.Die hard Butler fans will want to seek this out. Others may want to rent it just to see what its like. But if you were given a copy of this as a gift, watch it and then take it to your local DVD trader before everyone else does.",N/A

1319783,"Isn't it nice to have the time, the resources, and the money to be able to travel the world and rediscover life, love, and spirituality? We should all be as lucky as Elizabeth Gilbert. Her memoir, ""Eat, Pray, Love: One Woman's Search for Everything Across Italy, India and Indonesia,"" has sold millions, been on the ""New York Times"" Best Seller list for 158 weeks, and touched the lives of thousands. One of them was Oprah Winfrey, who devoted two whole episodes of her show to the book. I admit that I haven't read it, but I have done a little research on it and on Gilbert herself. I have to say, I don't much care for her or her story. Her journey of discovery, paid for by an advance on a novel she plans to write, seemed awfully selfish, for she had no real absences in her life; she was married, had an education, was a successful writer, and lived comfortably in New York. This wasn't enough for her?The film ""Eat Pray Love,"" which adapts Gilbert's story and has her portrayed by Julia Roberts, tells us that no, it wasn't enough. She divorces her husband (Billy Crudup), who, in an early divorce settlement scene, gave me more reason to side with him than with her. She has an affair with an attractive and all-around nice young actor (James Franco), which she then ends in a brazen display of tears brought on by God knows what. She then decides that it's time to take a year off and travel the world, to reconnect with herself, to once again have a zest for life - in other words, to escape from all the good things she had but never appreciated. She proceeds to spend four months in Italy, where she happily eats as much pasta and pizza as she can, with a few Napoleons on the side. She then spends the next four months in an Indian ashram, where the tries her hand at meditation, apparently under the impression that God can be grasped in one fell swoop. Finally, she goes to Bali, where she's presented with, but not necessarily willing to accept, love.Along the way, she just happens to meet a number of people. Never mind the fact that they all greatly impact her life, as such people tend to do in stories like this; it's a miracle they can all speak fluent English. One of them, wouldn't you know it, just happens to be from the great state of Texas. In Italy, she befriends a sassy Swede and a charming Italian, a couple who look like they stepped out of a Giorgio Armani ad. In India, she meets the Texan (Richard Jenkins), a loveably gruff old man whose every line sounds like it originated from a fortune cookie. He, of course, has his own tragic back story, although he only shares it at just such a time when it's most convenient for the plot. In Bali, she reunites with the obligatory wise elder (Hadi Subiyanto), the long suffering divorcee (Christine Hakim), and Felipe (Javier Bardem), who enters her life as men tend to do in most forgettable romantic comedies.There's nothing about this movie that feels authentic, and that's what infuriates me; it has the gall to pass itself off as an autobiography. I don't care how accurate Elizabeth Gilbert claims it is (she said during a ""Good Morning America"" interview that it played like a ""surreal home movie""). I don't believe her. This is the stuff of movies, not real life. Besides, she didn't visually document her journey at all - not a single photo, not a frame of film. All the more reason not to believe her. With so much doubt about the story's authenticity, and with Gilbert's questionable dismissal of the good life she so clearly had before making the journey, the film lacks any sense of spiritual enlightenment or emotional awakening; it comes off as little more than a portrait of a selfish woman on a sightseeing trip.Julia Roberts is a wonderful actress, and even though I disliked the woman she played, I still thought she gave a good performance. Javier Bardem seems to be channeling the same dashing mystique he employed in the much, much better ""Vicky Cristina Barcelona,"" which is to say he seems to be repeating himself, albeit competently. As for James Franco, let's just say that my mother has coined the perfect phrase for actors that display no range and speak in monotone lulls: ""They've just gotten a Novocain enema."" I don't know what director Ryan Murphy told him, but whatever he said, it was terrible advice. Franco is usually a very reliable, very convincing actor. Ever seen ""Milk""? Hell, ever seen ""Spider-Man""?""Eat Pray Love"" is phony, contrived, and unpleasant, made worse by the fact that we're supposed to take it as fact. Don't bother sending me comments that I'm wrong and that everything in the film comes directly from Gilbert's actual experiences. I'm not going to believe you. If the filmmakers had followed the leads of the people behind ""Under the Tuscan Sun"" and ""Letters to Juliet,"" who had the decency to label their films as works of fiction, then maybe I would have appreciated it more. But then again, no, I wouldn't have; there's still the matter of Elizabeth Gilbert, whose quest for meaning and happiness was really an exercise in trendy New Age mantra-talk and selfishness. The more I think about the journey she made, the less I like her as a person.",Eat Pray Love
790948,"Well worth a look, this well made movie is completely from the tormented viewpoint of the country priest via his journal.  I think it tells an important story, one worth serious contemplation.  But different people will get different things out if it.  Some may see it as inspiring, others as a cautionary tale.  I love the fact that it can be interpreted either way.  And perhaps in other ways as well, a real thought provoker.By coincidence, I happened to view this not long after watching the movie of Kurt Hamsun's ""Hunger.""  A movie also from the viewpoint of a lonely and troubled individual.  The similarities are interesting, as are the differences.  Both are clueless about reality, dumbfounded by its lack of fit with their idealisms about it.  Other people are mostly sources of confusion to them.  The priest is motivated by service, and the writer (in Hunger) by mere survival.  Both are completely incompetent at it, unable to connect with the rest of humanity in any meaningful way (though the priest does seem to make a little connection with another priest, that's about the extent of it).  Whether their psychological states could be said to be anything but disfunctional, is undoubtedly a matter of interesting debate from either side.My first impression is that the priest's torment, like the writer's in ""Hunger,"" was largely self-imposed, or at least, derived from his inability to recognize his own ignorance and do something useful about it.  Certainly, the townspeople were far less than model citizens, but this should not be all that surprising given the lack of solid priestly capabilities.  It seems to me that the young priest was not cut out for his job, wallowing in his sorrows which did himself no good and his parishoners a disservice.  His stomach problems seem a metaphor for the effects in the real world of his inability to understand much of anything.  He could not stomach the world, and the world had little stomach for him.  He does not offer what I would call a positive spiritual contribution, is a pain-in-the-gut for everyone else in one way or another, not just himself.  While he appears to have some empathy with others, I would say that it is merely imagined, as it seems only to arise in ways that are nonconstructive or inappropriate.  He seems to think he did well in his conversation with the countess, but it's not at all clear that the effect was actually a positive one.  It takes more than mere suffering to be a saint, one must also grow a backbone.  One must be able to effectively communicate.  Otherwise, say hello to self-indulgent masochism, blind fanaticism, or perhaps, just really lousy luck.  Like ""Hunger,"" ""Diary of a Country Priest,"" is akin to a train-wreck in slow motion.I say my ""first impression,"" here, because I suspect I will have other thoughts about it upon additional reflection and additional viewings.  I think there is a lot here to contemplate.",N/A

A virtual paragon of knowledge, Mary lives for nothing more than work and her bits of useless trivia, unloading her knowledge to all who will listen. Steve (Bradley Cooper) is a camera man working with television reporter Hartman Hughes (Thomas Hayden Church) for the local CCN news channel. When Mary's parents and Steve's parents set them up on a blind date, Steve doesn't have a great time and ends the date early while Mary sees him as the one and pursues him across the country.In 2009, Sandra Bullock had a red letter year at the movies. She started off the year with the romantic comedy The Proposal which became the highest grossing movie of her career. Later in the year she starred in The Blind Side which not only passed the $200 million to topple The Proposal as Bullock's highest grossing movie, but also proved that she truly had star power as her name was the sole star name on the marquee and has given the starlet Oscar buzz almost guaranteeing an Oscar nomination for Best Actress which would also be a career first. Bradley Cooper also had a great year that saw him starring in The Hangover which became the highest grossing R-rated comedy of all time, and getting cast in an upcoming A Team remake. With both stars having career years at the movies, you'd think this pairing would make for thrilling cinema.Unfortunately, I'm here to tell you that you'd be wrong. While I don't think this movie is as bad as the critics would tell you (showing up on many critic's worst of the year lists), I have to admit that the movie is not good. The characters in the movie find themselves in positions that are too absurd as the screenplay takes them to places that just don't really seem to fit. Also, the characters are not well written, being either cardboard cutouts of real people, or being too quirky for their own good. Sandra Bullock comes off the worst. While her acting is not bad, the character is too hapless, too unconvincing with too many quirks that leave you wondering how this woman survived this long in the modern world. The movie also tries to hard to make a statement about following the ""right road,"" being true to yourself, while also being a satire of sensationalist news coverage. The result is a climax that doesn't feel true to the tone of the rest of the movie while also being so sweet and sentimental that you'll find yourself in a diabetic coma by the movie's end.If there is a good point to this movie it's the news crew sent out by CCN to report on occurrences where no one else is available comprised of Steve, Hartman Hughes, and Angus (Ken Jeong). If they would have been played by any other actors they wouldn't have been so fun to watch, but their comedic timing is such that even at their most unlikable they still come across as fun to watch and make you feel that the movie should have revolved around them. They're playful jokey banter with each other, and hapless pranks that essentially drive the plot of the movie accentuates the type of the bromance love that we've been seeing in movies lately. While not the best written material, the actors play it well, and for that I have to give them props.On a certain level I can slightly recommend this movie, but on another level I cannot. It can be fun at times, and at other times it can be beyond ridiculous. If you're looking for a chuckle here or there and mindless entertainment you can probably get over my issues with the film (although Mary might still grate on your nerves a bit), but if you want more than I suggest you look for it elsewhere.2/5",All About Steve

176371,"I haven't read the graphic novel (though I should) but the film is a masterpiece of execution, bringing together a tightly-knitted plot, a tremendous cast of actors and some truly memorable visuals. V is a cinematic giant that transcends the melodramatic elements that dog many comic book adaptations, and manages to tread the line of raising complex political issues while capably keeping the audience in suspense every step of way.The main character, ""V"", is a model for every citizen - unchanged, unhinged, unwavering - he stands for ideas with a steadfast motivation that's both simple and admirable, against a backdrop of a totalitarian Great Britain as a portent of things to come. V is a fine example of mode-against-type, since he never takes off his mask, and is all the more powerful for that. It's remarkable how Hugo Weaving manages to convey the entire character without the audience ever seeing his face. Similarly, Natalie Portman is perfect in her role as a scared citizen who overcomes her fear of the system and develops a sense of true freedom.It's a great movie that's as important as it is well-made. It also has a phenomenal soundtrack from Dario Marianelli that just lifts the soul and underscores the transformative and inspirational message of the film.",N/A
893332,"Uwe Boll is often called the Ed Wood of the current film industry.  Compared to the acclaimed Worst Director of All Time, I think Boll's even worse that him.  Ed Wood may not have the budget (or logic) for any of his movies, but his movies are certainly original, or at least have original elements to stand out; can you think of a movie about aliens that raise people from the dead to threaten humanity for peace, or a movie that ended with the scientist fighting an octopus that explodes?  Boll does not have that same creative and ambitious mind, he prefers to take whatever exists in the media (i.e. video games) and defecate all over it.  His first film, ""House of the Dead"", is the bottom of the barrel of awful movies: the plot and characters are dumb, the camera shots are obnoxious awful (yea, let's have every survivor have 360 effect), the action had no substance, and it makes an asinine use of video game footage for scene transitions.  It was an incoherent, immature monstrosity.""Alone of the Dark"" isn't as bad the director's first disemBOLLment, but that's like saying a plate of excrement is better than a mountain-pile of it.  The plot was functional and it ties all the elements together (sans for the last few scenes), and at least Boll toned down the stupid camera effects for this film.  That being said, the camera effects still exist for insubstantial reasons, like the infamous monster shootout in the storage area where the camera pans and moves around like a 3D cartoon or the first-person POV during a walk in the alley when the camera makes sudden motion shifts.  I understand what the film's trying to present in those moments, but those effects aren't necessary; they're so exaggerated, they ended up losing their intended mood.  Boll makes a dubious effect to use these visual aspects for all of his movies; it's like he's trying to be Paul W.S. Anderson, but he doesn't quite understand his style.Everything else is standard Boll badness.  The actors are phoning it in, there's a lot of dragging, the special effects barely rise above those from Sci-Fi original movies, and overall uneventful to sit through.  ""Alone in the Dark"" is a weak effort, not even the director's cut can fix it.  As far what I know about this version (besides the intended framing of 2.35 instead of 1.78), the love scene between Tara Reid and Christian Slater in the original was cut; not like there was anything going on in that love scene, so it wasn't a big loss.",Alone in the Dark

1277039,"t's always so reassuring to see the opening credits of a Woody Allen film. The screen is black, the credits come and go very neatly, a tune playing in the background, and then the movie begins. Whatever Work's begins this way, and as the final credit fades away, so begins the beautiful flow of dialogue that Allen has written for us, to entertain and to persuade us to think and laugh simultaneously. His follow up to Vicky Christina Barcelona, Whatever Works is about... well, the title says it all.Seinfeld co-creator and Curb Your Enthusiasm creator/star Larry David plays Boris Yellnikoff, a nuclear physicist who claims to be a genius who was once almost nominated for a Nobel Prize. Boris is a grouchy old nihilist who, through his infinite knowledge, has decided that nothing in the world is really meaningful or important. He sees himself as surrounded by a bunch of ""inchworms"", and in his inspired opening monologue, he addresses us-the audience-informing us that he is not a likeable guy. He knows this, and does us what I'm sure he sees as a common courtesy.Boris lives in an apartment in Chinatown, and spends his time either lecturing to a table of his companions at a local coffee shop, or reluctantly teaching chess to kids, whom he refers to as imbeciles and morons. One night, as he's walking home, he stumbles upon a young girl named Melody St. Anne Celestine (Evan Rachel Wood) begging for food, and hesitantly allows her into his home. His opinion of her initially fits in with his outlook on the world, but over time he grows fond of her, and she grows fond of him. As their relationship strangely becomes something more than seems logical or even possible, events take a bizarre and unpredictable turn that leads Boris to question his own perspective, bringing him to new revelations and to the philosophy: whatever works!This attitude ends up being shared by nearly every character in the movie, including Melody's beauty-pageant-stage-mom, Marietta (Patricia Clarkson), and her adulterous, God-fearing father, John (Ed Begley Jr.), who both show up out of the clear blue sky, looking for their daughter who ran away from home. They are a southern family, but they may as well be aliens to Boris, and vice versa. Wonderful performances spiral around Larry David's brilliant work as the curmudgeon, Yellnikoff. His delivery of Allen's lines is pitch-perfect, something that I came into this film expecting. The two just seems to naturally click. Wood also does some of her most intriguing work as the nave out-of-town girl who is drawn to Boris' strange ways almost at once.The film could almost be done as a stage play, in that the scenes are fairly static, and involve many long monologues that play nicely against the dialogue that bounces between characters. There are many long streams of dialogue filmed without cutting away, which I like a lot. Allen does this frequently, and it allows the actors to talk and bicker with feeling and authenticity. My only issue with Whatever Works is that it is harmlessly illogical, and by the end, everything is too tidily settled and at ease. I like how Allen plays around with fate and happiness, but there are some bits and pieces in the final third of the movie that don't quite work. Having said that, I think Allen has a pretty decent comedy here, one that may not equal some of his other recent films, but-whatever works!",N/A

It is indeed very visually pretty; the stark black and white is definitely pleasing to the eye (the opening in particular, the shot of the baby opening the window is just breathtaking).

672509,"This 1978 production of Eugene O'Neill's ""Mourning Becomes Electra,"" is not to be missed. Inspired by Aeschylus' 5th-century BC ""Oresteia"" trilogy, O'Neill's tragedy, written in 1931, likewise consists of three dramas: ""Homecoming,"" ""The Hunted,"" and ""The Haunted."" These have been divided into several episodes on two discs. The production is so well done that I watched it straight through from beginning to end.The actors, the settings, and the costumes are of such outstanding quality that one soon forgets the annoying colorisation of the era. Joan Hackett, surely one of the underrated actresses of the 20th century, infuses the character of Christine Mannon--the Clytemnestra of the drama--with an understated vulnerability that wins her the understanding, if not the sympathy, of the audience. Roberta Maxwell is Hackett's equal in her role as Christine's warped daughter Lavinia--the Electra surrogate--in whom smolder fires of jealousy against her mother and overwrought love for her father. It is fascinating to see Lavinia gradually evolve into the persona of her hated mother as the play progresses. Eugene O'Neill, in fact, has performed a remarkable reversal on the Aeschylean original, which moves from a situation in which the characters, bound by fate at the beginning of the drama, are eventually released as the plot unfolds. O'Neill's drama works from the opposite perspective. Instead of unfolding, the events of the tragedy spiral in ever-narrowing circles around Lavinia, until she is bound inextricably in a net of her own weaving.Erich Segal's commentary at the end of each episode is especially enlightening, both in respect to O'Neill as a playwright and his concentration on Electra [Lavinia] whom, Segal notes, O'Neill considered a character that Aeschylus relegated to the sidelines in the ""Oresteia"". Those who remember Erich Segal only as the author who struck it rich with the Hollywood tearjerker ""Love Story,"" need to be reminded that he had a PhD in Comparative Literature from Harvard and was a professor of Latin and Greek at Yale. He is therefore qualified to present an informed commentary on the play. Despite the rather stilted camera work [i.e., look into camera A; now look into camera B] Segal's comments are both interesting and insightful.Much effort and money went into this production for Connecticut Public Television, as is evident in the exquisite 1860's costumes and the elegant detail of the interior of the Mannon household. As in Aeschylus' ""Agamemnon,"" the first play of his trilogy, the house itself is central to the tragedy. A Greek revival antebellum structure, its high porch, complete with fluted ionic columns and double doors, becomes a stage for the drama, and the black wreaths of mourning periodically hung on its white walls lend stark emphasis to the tragedy.  O'Neill's ending to his trilogy makes Aeschylus' metaphor of the ""witnessing walls"" devastatingly explicit. Composer Maurice Jarre sets the mood with music which, in its subtle creepiness, is as unlike his opulent melodic scores for ""Lawrence of Arabia"" and ""Doctor Zhivago"" as it is possible to be.Eugene O'Neill's trilogy may be from the previous century, but with the superb realization of his characters as performed by Hackett and Maxwell, it withstands the test of time.",Eugene O'Neill's Mourning Becomes Electra Broadway Theatre Archive

It's definitely my kind of flick so I thought I'd give it a shot and I'm glad I did.This is a really good story in the historical epic category. It propounds to be based in fact and, though I don't know how much they had to tweek it for script purposes, it contains certain things that feel true.Arn is a Swede who falls in love with a woman who is betrothed to another family. He knocks her up so she has to do 20 years in a convent while he has to do twenty years in the Crusades as a Knight Templar. As he himself was raised by the church he's a very serious dude. He was also schooled well in combat by a monk who did time in the Crusades so he can fight with the best of them. He heads off to the Holy Land where he becomes key in winning some battles. His time is up so he heads home to be with his woman but ends up facing a whole new challenge. It seems Sweden isn't all that united and there is a new grab for power he needs to thwart.This is an Historical Epic in the best sense. Great locations, costumes and lots of extras. You like Arn. He's a cool guy because he's good and devout, but can kick booty if he needs to. You like Cecelia his girlfriend. She's pretty and has a good spirit. It's acted well, shot well, edited well. The music score is good, though maybe a bit too similar to the ""Lord of the Rings"" score but that's a minor quibble. I also could have used a bit more in the building of the relationship between the two Cecelias, but again, it's a minor quibble. Surprisingly, they spent little effort on the major battle scenes. Were this Ridley Scott or Antoine Fuqua we'd have been dazzled by meticulous staging and swordplay. But here the director just didn't seem that interested. It's as though the battle scenes were no more important than anything else going on. I could have used more there myself but they were good enough to get the point across and move me to the next scene.This is a good, solid effort. It has all the right things in all the right measure.

1185230,"Roger Ebert gave this movie two stars, but he obviously wasn't paying attention from the get-go.  For example, he indicates that it's scientifically ""unlikely from a Darwinian point of view that two human species should evolve independently  and contemporaneously on separate worlds.  Even more so that they would share common sexual feelings and be able to mate. . . .""  After the main character, Kainan (played by Jim Caviezel), crashes on earth at the beginning of the movie, he asks his portable computer where he is.  It responds with ""Abandoned seed colony.""  So, obviously, Kainan and the people of earth have the same origin, i.e. Kainan's people got earth going a while back, abandoned the project and no one on earth knows about it.  It's called panspermia.All that being said, the film is an interesting take on the Beowulf legend that explains how such a creature could have suddenly ""popped up"" in Viking culture.  In the movie, the Grendel analog is known as the Moorwen, but it's much quicker and more powerful than anything in the Beowulf poem, making its eradication more of a group effort.All the actors do a fine job in this one, from Caviezel to John Hurt to Ron Perlman to Jack Huston.

To view the current 1:85.1 aspect ratio DVD properly on HDTV (filling the entire screen) I have to set the HDMI DVD player on ""480P"" and use the ""full"" screen setting.

1376902,"When I saw my first episode of ""Billy the Exterminator,"" I was instantly hooked! Just how cool is it to watch someone tackle pests like giant yellow jacket nests, bobcats, and hoards of bats up in someone's attic? At first these type situations were the draw, then I starting noticing something as the episodes progressed. Billy is actually a very cool and sweet guy - he obviously cares about his family, he cares about his work, and a couple of times I've fought back a tear or two watching him help, as an example, a family of three kids who'd recently lost their mom. They had a huge roach infestation problem, one beyond my ability to aptly describe here. Billy not only treated the problem and corrected it, he did so gratis and even gave the kids autographs when they asked him for them. In the end, this is what makes Billy and what's destroyed Kate Gosselin - Billy is real. I predict that ""Billy the Exterminator"" will run for 4-7 years, and after its run Billy will still be at Vexcon happily running the family business. It appears that he knows who he is, his priorities are what they ought to be, and his compassion and humor show through in every single episode.And hey, before I forget - Big Bill is funny as hell, he has a very dry sense of humor. Ricky and Billy together deliver classic lines in some sequences (""This is the Vexcon totem pole of death!""), and Donnie is a classy, mature lady, she's even kinda hot!Billy rocks - check this season one and you'll understand why!",N/A

The storyline is your typical love triangle where every character has a love interest in the wrong person. This situation provokes the characters to interact strangely with one another & behave awkwardly. The plot is well developed with majority of the moments focused on the comedic expressions of the characters but does have some dull moments though.The voice acting is excellent in portraying the characters personalities & emotions. The dialogue is straight forward & understandable with very little confusing grammar that might cause the viewer to scratch their heads.I recommend this anime series.Thanks.,N/A
1284643,"We're so lucky someone had the foresight to tape these rehearsals, otherwise we would have had nothing.The sound is terrific, the stage is second only in size and scope to Pink Floyd's stadium sets.This was truly an ambitious undertaking. MJ was using the largest 3-D screen in the world as his back drop. There was not a clunker song in the set. The musicians were incredible and so were the dancers and all the crew.The songs we've heard before; his hits. MJ doesn't like to vary too much from the album versions but the musicians are allowed to embellish it a little and the songs truly sound fresh and vigorous.MJ's moves are super natural. He was a god of entertainment, a most fully realized performer.He got down.The band rocked. He's the funk master. He's hypnotic and mesmerizing to watch...crank this up on a good sound system and be prepared to be swept away.Everybody else is just sloppy seconds. He was The Man!If all you've ever seen of MJ are his music videos then you need to see this. I'm a musician and believe it or not was never too impressed with his music videos since they have to be lip-synched and you can stop and start the filming and edit out mistakes.I truly became a fan of Michael when I saw him perform live in 2001 at the Madison Square Garden 30th anniversary of his solo career show. That was live so I could tell that he can really move like that and it's not just video magic.This show is live rehearsal and they are pretty much ready to go. They are just fine tuning so you get to see the band and MJ in excellent form.He does the robot dance, does a dance where it looks like he's driving a car.. He moves like liquid lightning.Every song was a universe on to itselfDuring the song ""Human Nature"" he does these really squirrely moves that didn't seem to make sense to me at all but then all of sudden he kicks into this high note and it all makes sense...Wow!He was on and he was ready to go but fate had other plansLike Elvis before him Michael did it his wayThe film actually shows the musicians playing behind Michael which I like so you know it's not a tape and they aren't lip-synching.Michael grew up in the day when you really had to know how to sing and play an instrument.The producers of this movie should have released the live songs from this performance on a CD. Instead they chose to rerelease the studio versions of the songs which everybody has already heard on CD.The dance routines are stunning...what an artist!You have to see it to believe itHe was truly in a different leagueYou have Michael and then there is everybody elseWe love you MJ.",Michael Jackson: This Is It Theatrical Release

967782,"Most fans of giallo films have an anticipation for each new film they discover with a overwhelming desire to see gorgeous european women being chased in colorful Italian backdrops to eventually find their demise by a black gloved killer. Usually the kills are extremely  creative, sometimes defying logic and the women end up exposed, in an artistic way while under the light of early 70's psychadelica.With Black Belly of the Tarantula, you find something less than common with the films characters. Most films of this genre follow the triangular pattern of an innocent man caught in between the killer and the law but Black Belly does not follow that same typical story telling. Giancarlo Gianni plays a distraught inspector trying to solve the case of brutal murders, where the victims are paralyzed by a poison needle in the back of the neck and they eviscerated with a scalpel knife, but the inspector is reluctant to finish they case and has thoughts of resigning before the murders are solved.Although this film came out relatively the same year as the great American crime film Dirty Harry by Don Segal, Black Belly shares the same theme of a frustrated but engaging inspector with distrust for the system and hatred for the criminals that he is always pursuing.The conclusion of the film has its regular twist and red herrings applied but the ending scene has more emotional attatchment than most giallo films.",The Black Belly of the Tarantula
1281964,"For me, this movie talks about lonely ""Otaku,"" which literally means maniac, but is the equivalent of fan-boy, geek, or comic book nerd.This movie follows Ueno, this nice, but lonely guy, an Otaku. Ueno's parents bought him a sexy maid driod when he was a kid.  He always had a crush on her, and after high school, he falls in love with her, and ends up spending his whole life with her.There are a bunch of sub-stories, like a cute police chief who is trying to find a rogue robot, and a couple of mean Otaku, who contrast with the nice lonely Ueno.It's live action, with a pretty limited budget, so the maid droids are real people with some cheesy robot sound effects sometimes when they move.  Reminded me of what I love about 70's and 80's American sci-fi.I liked this movie a lot.  Good, solid science fiction.  Good story.  Entertaining movie. Good ending. Sexy. I couldn't find anything negative about it besides that it's way too sensual for youngsters.On a side note, I usually really don't like Pinocchio-style books or movies, but I could stand the Pinocchio references in this one. Maybe because there weren't that many.  I also usually don't like movies that talk about Asimov's three rules of robots, but I liked this movie.",Maid-Droid

295817,"You have to wonder what goes on in the alcohol and drug addled brains of Hollywood producers that compel  them to re-make classic films. I mean, why not re-make terrible films and turn them into classics. Instead, Hollywood producers take classics and produce terrible re-makes? This brings us to Robin Hood. The 1938 version with Errol Flynn, Olivia de Havilland, Basil Rathbone, et al is a classic.There will never be a better Robin Hood, a more gracious Marion, nor a better group of merry men. Variations on a theme, like ""Men in Tights"" and ""Robin and Marion"" are welcome additions/extensions, but why on earth would you try to re-make the original?That brings us to the 1991 TV movie ""Robin Hood"", starring Patrick Bergin and Uma Thurman, with Jurgen Prochnow as the bad guy. Now there's nothing wrong with Patrick Bergin who's given us good performances in ""Sleeping with the Enemy"" (1991), ""Frankenstein"" (1992), and several other films. But he's no Errol Flynn. Bergin is clumsy with a sword, can barely run, much less fly around on ropes and vines, and his moustache is far too well groomed to be a guy living in a cave.21 year old Uma Thurman is cute as a button. This was her 7th film and her first starring role. She went on to bigger and better things (""Pulp Fiction"", ""Kill Bill""), and while her performance is certainly adequate, she has neither the beauty nor the class of Olivia de Havilland. Of course, few actresses do or did.Jurgen Prochnow is a joke as the evil Frenchman. His accent, when he remembers to use it,  was stolen from an old Peter Sellers movie, and Prochnow too appears clumsy and slow footed, a comic parody of the sleek, villainous Basil Rathbone who dueled with Flynn in several movies, but none better than in Robin Hood. Prochnow is a good actor (""Das Boot"", ""Dune"", ""Air Force One""), but this must stand as one of his worst performances.There isn't really much to say. The photography is adequate; there is a musical score; there are a host of merry men, but none of them are notable, and Edward Fox's brief cameo as King John looks as painful to Fox as it is to us.There is absolutely no reason to see this film. Go back to the original, or take a look at ""Robin and Marion"". No other Robin Hood film really merits our attention.BTW - several reviewers have commented on the ""historical accuracy"" of this film. Duh! It's a legend guys! There was no Robin Hood.

The actors/actresses not only had FAR below poor acting skills, but were also beat severely with the ugly stick! I'm not a super shallow person or anything, I advocate the use of everyday-looking people in movies for a more authentic sense of quality, but when everyone in the movie looks like they came from a low-income, white-trash town in the Middle of Nowhere somewhere from the Midwest, you have to draw the line somewhere!

1047753,"Anyone who has ever complained about big budget movies being predictable, cliche-ridden, shallow, pandering, stupid, style-over-substance, etc. ect. should see this movie.  I knew I was in for something special when the movie began in 18th century France and people looked unhealthy, filthy, & stench-ridden.  Although I must note that they did not get the teeth right.  Up until last century, oral health for the majority of the population was of little concern.  By in large, people's gums were diseases, and their teeth ugly, and their breath beyond foul.  Which reminds me to remind you to floss (only approx 25% of people in N.America do), and find out how to do it right.The story itself possesses fantastical elements, and there are anachronisms, so this isn't just an attempt at a literal recreation of the 18th century France.  So don't think that the movie is going to be one long dreary stench-fest.  Rather it is like an adult version of a Grimms's story, or maybe Hans Christian Anderson.  I would advise against reading any reviews, because this movie is best approached cold, and especially on Amazon where the do not have a SPOILER policy.

I read a few reviews saying there were no likable characters in this film, and while I don't think there are any cookie cutter good guys, I don't think that is true.SpoilersThe movie starts with a romance between Jude Law and Natlie Portman.  Its almost purely physical it seems, and after a while because of the lack of tension he finds attraction with Julia Roberts.  Because he can't have Julia, because she doesn't want to cheat on Natalie, Jude pretends to be her on a sex chat with Clive Owen, in what may be the performance of his career.  He wants to have control over her since he can't exert that in a relationship.  He is not being honest with his partner.  Taking away control from her for selfish reasons.  Julia and Clive really do fall in love and get married, and eventually she runs accross Jude again.  They begin an affair and fall in love each dumping their partners.  In order to get the divorce from Clive, Julia sleeps with him, and Jude dumps her because he can't take the knowledge and the control taken away from him.  Jude eventually wisens up and goes back to face Clive, who tells him there is no way he is getting Julia back, but he knows where Natalie is and he should go back there.  But before Jude leaves, he has to exert control, and tells him the reason he knows where she is, is because he slept with her after Julia dumped him.  Jude and Natalie get back together, but Natalie denies sleeping with Clive.  Time passes and Jude begs for the truth because it is eating him up, and Natalie admits to it, before breaking up with him.  That was her control in the relationship, and having to give that up again is too painful, and she leaves.  It is revealed ingeniously that she had more control that thought because she did love him, and she had to protect herself, where as she did not with Clive because it was just sex.  its about protecting our emotions in an oversexed world.  A lot of people don't like Clive and Natalie because they had sex, but they were both single and consenting adults, but Natalie is pure enough to get away.  Its about honesty and power games in relationships, and how vulnerable we are willing to be.  How well we know people, and how we are different people with different people because we are never ourselves with them.  Great film",N/A

1175849,"Jia Zhang-ke's melancholic film ""Still Life"" is about the search for a personal past amidst the destruction of the present. A man and a woman travel separately to the Three Gorges part of China looking for their lost spouses. But the towns along the Yantze River are being torn down and obliterated by the construction of a mammoth hydroelectric project. Paradoxically, archeologists still search for ancient artifacts as their surroundings are being systematically destroyed. The loneliness and despair that the people in the film display reflects a society where the speed of industrialization, corruption and political powerlessness create a feeling of hopelessness and inertia; perhaps that's the meaning of the film's title, although to survive economically, workers must always be on the move. Zhang-ke has a quasi-documentary film style that captures the mundane aspects of the everyday life of his primarily working-class characters. He introduces a few fantasy elements without comment--a UFO blazes through the sky and the shell of an apartment building becomes a rocket ship.

1295743,"The primary Merriam-Webster definition of ""Avatar"" is: ""In Hindu Mythology, the descent of a deity to the earth in an incarnate form or some manifest shape; the incarnation of a god."" A secondary definition in the computing world is: ""A graphical image that represents a person, as on the Internet."" In short, a virtual incarnation.M. Night Shyamalan's THE LAST AIRBENDER (originally AVATAR: THE LAST AIRBENDER) covers the first defintion. James Cameron's AVATAR covers the second definition, though Cameron managed to force Shyamalan to change his title. The truth is that Shyamalan's films are phantasmagorical, and I find them either uneasily engrossing (The Village) or uneasily boring (Lady in the Water). THE LAST AIRBENDER falls into the first category, though without the uneasiness. Never having watched the animated series, and being unfamiliar with the complex universe of Katara and Aang the last airbender, I can't say that I knew that I was missing anything in THE LAST AIRBENDER.I found the conceptual universe rather fascinating though. The idea of four human tribes, each related to one of the Classical Elements, and each with ""Benders"" who can manipulate those elements through a series of stylized katas caught my imagination. I liked the idea that one human, The Avatar, has been successively reincarnated and has learned to use all the Elements. I found the melange of cultural elements among the four races fascinating too, from the Tibetan Buddhist-styled Air Nation (who wear the Dalai Lama's colors and use his name, Gyatso) to the Native American/Eskimo-styled Water Nation with their ice teepees and igloos, to the technologically-advanced steam-era militants, the Fire Nation. The Earth Nation barely made an appearance, though.The downside to THE LAST AIRBENDER was not characterization, it was the pacing of the story. The story itself, of the Fire Nation seeking to enslave the yet-untrained Avatar made perfect sense, and the main characters were engaging. But the film dragged deplorably in spots as Shyamalan struggled to fill up 120 minutes of screen time with 60 minutes of script and the presumption of a sequel.Overall, I enjoyed THE LAST AIRBENDER (which surprised me; I assumed it would be intolerable, based on the previews), and I would like to see the sequel, and now that I've been introduced to the story I'll probably give the cartoon show a whirl, but Shyamalan needs to give The next LAST AIRBENDER a bit more---quite a bit more---story and substance. In sum, this was his version ofStar Trek - The Motion Picture: A worthy first effort, not quite up to expectations.",The Last Airbender

254166,"Now, I will admit it...I was never a great fan of John Huston's ""The African Queen"", as I viewed it's television airings, over the years. The story was too sappy (with an atypical, for Huston, 'happy' ending), Bogie was silly, rather than cool, the rear-screen effects during the rapids scenes looked pretty artificial, the overall picture and sound was poor...well, you get the picture!So I purchased ""The African Queen (Commemorative Box Set)"" with reluctance, more for the special features than the film, itself...and BOY, was I in for a SURPRISE!!! With the cleaned-up audio and video elements, the film looks and sounds brand-new, and I could finally truly savor the remarkable performances of Bogart and Hepburn (Bogie won the 'Best Actor' Oscar in the role, beating, among others, Brando in ""A Streetcar Named Desire"", and Clift in ""A Place in the Sun"", and after viewing this edition, I can honestly say he deserved it!) Jack Cardiff's technicolor cinematography is breathtaking (even if he calls it 'routine', in the marvellous 'Making of' documentary, included), and the Agee/Huston adaptation of C.S. Forrester's novel crackles with witty one-liners and humanity. The boxed edition also includes a one-hour Lux radio adaptation, starring Bogie and Greer Garson, Katharine Hepburn's funny written account of the production (""The Making of The African Queen or How I Went to Africa with Bogart, Bacall and Huston and Almost Lost My Mind""), lobby card photos, and a four-panel recreation of how classic technicolor works...lots of goodies at a very reasonable price!Do yourself a favor...Invest in this collection!

914815,"This film is a bit catatonic. Otoh, it is probably so intentionally, but then, I'm not sure what the director wanted to say through his unusual script; maybe it was radical in 1960s, but now I couldn't see what he was after. I mean, it's not quite a documentary, although it does have a fair amount of info about Bach's life. But I'd expect more from a documentary (one thing, I haven't learned anything I didn't already know).What's good about this film is that there's a lot of music played, and a lot of it is played by the young Leonhardt (where will you see such footage nowadays?). The orchestra is Concentus Musicus (Harnoncourt's famous band); they play very well. Sound quality is about what you'd expect from 1960s. All in all, I didn't love it, I didn't hate it, it's more like... well, three stars. OK for a rental because of music.",Chronicle of Anna Magdalena Bach

May's other love in life is sewing, which is perfect because, when her attempts to make friends fail, May is going to make one of her very own. Sweetly macabre, May is a macabre fairy tale about a sad little girl who just wants to live happily ever after.The brilliance of this film is the creation of a insane, ruthless character who we come to love and cheer on. Angela Bettis does an amazing job of making May so sweet and vulnerable, that when the killing starts, our affection for May isn't lessened; if anything, it is strengthened, as she turns from a bullied, insecure individual into someone who is assertive and strong.",May
1292249,"Set in Harlem in 1987, ""Precious: Based on the Novel `Push` By Sapphire"" takes us to a world that most of us will be fortunate enough never to have to experience first hand - one where troubled adults produce even more troubled offspring, where individuals, ignored and abandoned by the society at large, struggle to survive in a self-perpetuating cycle of hopelessness and despair.  Just by the mere act of taking us to this world, the movie at least forces us to acknowledge its existence.  Whether or not we choose to do something about it is a whole other matter.This harrowing drama, adapted by Geoffrey S. Fletcher, focuses on Claireese `Precious` Jones, an introverted, inarticulate and overweight 16-year-old victim of incest who is already pregnant with her second child from the father who regularly rapes her.  Though filled with dreams of a better life, Precious is caught in a vortex of misery from which there appears to be no escape: grinding poverty, a mother who abuses her (physically, sexually, psychologically), a school system that is failing her, and peers who harass and torment her on a regular basis (though she is certainly streetwise and physically imposing enough to give back as good as she gets).  Small wonder, then, that the youngster has no friends and zero sense of self-worth.  Only in voiceover recitation is Precious able to articulate her innermost thoughts and feelings and, even then, those reflections are strictly limited to the vocabulary and reference-points familiar to her from the harshly circumscribed environment in which she lives.  Yet, those reflections are no less heartfelt and sincere for that.  Even the dreams she has for her own life - of becoming a world-famous singer and dancer - are fueled by the cliches of the pop culture world that surrounds her and, hence, are in no way realistic or achievable for a girl in her situation.The small glimmers of realistic hope that do find their way into Precious' life come in the form of a remedial reading program she enrolls in after her pregnancy forces her to leave her current school, and the caring and compassionate teacher who is the first to unlock some of the potential trapped deep inside the young girl's damaged psyche.  Precious is convinced that no one loves her - worse, that, since every form of love that has come her way up to this point in her life has been hurtful and damaging, that love itself must, by definition, be hurtful and damaging as well.Directed with unhurried restraint by Lee Daniels, ""Precious"" is a showcase for some amazing female performers who, in the short time we spend with them, make an indelible mark on our spirits and hearts.  Paula Patton is very good as the attractive lesbian teacher who reaches out a hand of friendship to the troubled girl, as is a de-glamorized Mariah Carey playing Precious' social worker, Ms. Weiss.  But it is Gabourey Sidibe, in her film debut as Precious, and comedienne Mo'Nique (who won a Best Supporting Actress Oscar for this role), as the monstrous mother from hell, who create unforgettable portraits - the first, of a girl who holds everything she feels inside herself almost to the point of emotional implosion, and the second, of a woman who can`t react to the world around her except through an uncontrollable paroxysm of anger and rage.The movie occasionally interrupts the grim narrative with fantasy sequences that reflect Precious' desires to escape from reality - including, most bizarrely, one in which she imagines herself as a character in the Sophia Loren movie ""Two Women,"" of all things.  Random but definitely interesting.Uncompromising in its realism, yet still daring to hope, ""Precious"" the movie perfectly reflects Precious the person.",N/A

1290734,"Horror-comedies are one of the hardest hybrid genres to do right - the contrasting elements tend to choke each other out.  Now, a lot of horror movies haves touches of humor added in that work well (although I can't think of too many straight-out comedies that add in brief scenes of horror - that probably wouldn't work out at all).  But Jennifer's Body is one of the rare exceptions that other hopefuls in the field could take a cue from.  With perfect casting, it stars Megan Fox as popular, super-hot head cheerleader Jennifer and Amanda Seyfried as her adorably nerd-ish best friend, nick-named 'Needy'.  Interestingly, although a lot of comedies work at making their leads precisely fit their stereotype niches, both the lead characters have more depths and between-the-lines character traits than might be expected.The title ""Jennifer's Body"" refers to the possession of, well, Jennifer's body by a demonic entity, but rather than the demon taking over entirely, the result is a being who's a mix of the demon's personality and Jennifer's original personality.  For the storyline beyond that, it's difficult to know how much to say.  The movie is designed in a way that you don't necessarily 'get' what's really going on until later in, although the trailers and promo material revealed an awfully lot of it well before the movie even opened.  In trying to walk a line between giving away too much information and not saying anything at all, I'll say that the plot involves a Satanic sacrifice gone wrong (leaving aside the question of whether there's any such thing as a Satanic sacrifice gone right?)  The motivation behind the sacrifice and its exact nature would probably sound quite stupid if I wrote it down (I thought it sounded stupid when I first heard about it before seeing the movie, but it works vastly better on screen than it sounds) but suffice it to say that this angle would never have worked in a more or less 'straight' horror movie, would never hae worked in a comedy, would Only have worked in a movie that expertly balances both those elements and managed to have them complement each other, not cancel each other out.  The botched sacrifice generates results that the killers had hoped for - vast personal gain - but also an unexpected result: a town resident walking around with a real, hellspawned beast living inside them.Again, its horror-comedy nature works to the movie's advantage, allowing it to explore contrasting directions that it otherwise couldn't have.  It's funny, bloody, sexy, creepy, surreal and at times unexpectedly touching.  One particular scene stands out in my mind as one of the most visually iconic scare moments in a while, and another stands out as one of the most memorably and movingly beautiful images.  Very well acted, with an unexpected finale to die for.  Definately one of 2009's most under-rated movies.",N/A

I would love to see these two fine actors together again in a sequel.  The overall plot of the movie is about a comedic journey.  The zombies are background noise as they should be to an otherwise brilliant comedy.  The film has British humor overtones at times.  This fact likely struck my fancy.  (I love British comedy.) The ""rules"" had me roaring with laughter.  The quest for a Twinkie and the glorious, magnificent cameo by a surprise guest star (I won't spoil it for you) make this film soar to the top of the horror comedy genre.

Though the behaviorists probably talk too much during the show, one can't help themselves from wanting to talk to the guy/girl next to you and discuss what you would have done/would do were you in the same situation.  Yes, you find yourself screaming at the screen at times trying to give the participants some clue as to what they should be doing or shouldn't be doing, almost even to the morbid point of finding yourself staring open mouthed as some of the harder hitting things happening (like the participants getting their food, survival items taken from them by researcher provided marauders), much in the same way you can't help but stand up and cheer when you see the participants do surprisingly well for themselves (like when the blonde housewife tries to take off the head of one of the researcher provided bad guys, or when a dwarfed martial artist drops one of the huge, muscle-bound researcher provided bad guys to the mat with a roundhouse kick to the head).

Two funny guys who apparently have a one dimensional ability to keep you laughing only within the spectrum of specific circumstances.  Four Christmases was not that venue.  While I admittedly did let a burst of chuckling escape now and again it was more of the slapstick comedy than anything the actor might have done.  I am a little surprised that Reese Witherspoon participated in a movie of this nature.  She always seemed more seasoned and above a swing and a complete miss such as this.Damn, now that sounds harsh doesn't it?  Let me back up a little.  It was a Sunday evening, my fantasy football team had lost, knocking out any glimmer that I had of the playoffs and I was tired from drinking a little too much the night before.  It is surprising how a little wine can knock you for a loop when you don't drink that much.  You get dinged for drinking in excess and you get dinged when you don't drink enough.  You just can't win anymore can you?So we rented a movie to go with the theme of Thanksgiving since I had watched a total of four in the span of four days.  I seem to go in spurts of movie watching and I am smack in the middle of an episode.  My girlfriend and I don't always agree with our first choices so we settled on Four Christmases as a compromise.  It seemed light hearted and we always like a good laugh.  My first choice was the GI Joe movie but she vetoed that immediately.  I guess I will have to watch that one today while she is out and enjoy it in the quite solitude as I crank the volume on high.Four Christmases is about a man a woman who are living together and are so removed from family feelings they don't even have the desire to get married.  They spend their holidays on various beaches lying to their families so they don't have to venture back home.  Both sets of both parents are divorced so they have in total four houses for Christmas.  As luck would have it their flight gets canceled and they are they get interviewed on TV at the airport.  Their families' view the nightly news and they find themselves stuck seeing all four parents for one Christmas holiday.  Are you stressed yet?  It is difficult seeing one set of parents, it might kill you to see that much family all in one day.As you might expect everyone is the most dysfunctional insane people you might find anywhere on the planet.  I wonder how these two turned out normal at all.  The couple goes through the typical road bump that faces all couples in romantic comedies and they then figure out how to proceed in life.  Ah, isn't it good that everything always works out in the end.It was a little short on common sense and the believability of almost anyone was stretched.  Nobody has that many messed up people in one family.  Somebody needs to be normal to keep the peace.  Laughs were physical acts of babies puking and falling off of roofs.  It just didn't have any depth at all.  I don't have to have much in a movie but give me something.It is not the worst movie I have ever seen and if you are in the mood for a couple of beers beforehand it might make it a little worthwhile.

It does one of the very few things that 'realistic and gritty' tv shows often never do by not forgetting to bring the humour along for the ride.The plot is relatively complex but it's never hard to follow due to the acting talents of the cast, stellar writing, and the fact that you can't help but become invested in the show. The writers make you feel like you're in safe hands and that they know where they're going, and whomever did the casting deserves a thumbs up and a pat on the head, the recessions answer to a payrise.By the time I got half-way through the first season I ended up rushing out to buy the rest of the set and said goodbye to friends and family.

(It would have to be, since his biggest credit thus far is as writer/director of the classic BABE--but not the sequel!)Here, Beatrix Potter-Heelis (Ren&eacute;e Zellweger in what is hailed as the performance of a lifetime) is followed from her young adulthood to her marriage to country solicitor William Heelis (the great Lloyd Owen). Starting with her success as a children's author (THE children's author?) and ending with her purchase of Lake District land, the film breathes. I mean, it truly breathes with locations, costume (no designs, they used off-the-rack genuine stuff), perfect acting and a hint of the jolly humor Beatrix showed in abundance.Though I'm no expert on Beatrix, this dvd has two delightful, 20-minute-long documentaries explaining the life of Beatrix and the making of this film. Well worth it. In the biography, I learned that Beatrix married Heelis later in life, and there is no mention of her engagement to her publisher Norman Warne (perfectly cast Ewan MacGregor, allegedly Zellweger's idea). I do know that the Warnes are still around and in business.One thing I adored about this film was the attention paid to the actual composition/publication of the books, though it does not touch the number of books Beatrix published. It also shies away from her marketing genius: she virtually invented ""marketing rights"" and had royalties pouring in from endless sources, not just her books. She could have sold film rights...who knows.The addition of Bill Paterson as Beatrix's father Rupert and Barbara Flynn as her mother Helen is the most perfect casting I think I've ever seen in any film. Without over-burdening the film, these two immortals add the perfect weight to the portrayal of Beatrix's life. Indeed, this film could not have been done without them!My other favorites David Bamber (VALKYRIE) as Frewing Warne, Anton Lesser as Harold Warne and Phyllida Law (Emma Thompson's mother) as Mother Warne only add to the expert family quality of this great film. A surprise is in the character of Millie Warne (Emily Watson), Beatrix's best friend. Finally, kudos to the rarely seen Matyelok Gibbs as Ms. Wiggin, Beatrix's governess/chaperone.I can't say enough about this priceless gem, one of the unforgettable cinema classics of the 2000s. Get it and let your kids immerse themselves in it--especially if they like Beatrix's books (or even if they like Harry Potter).

Watched it in the dark (fell asleep halfway through!)I saw the movie in IMAX and well, wasn't expecting IMAX in my living room but again the picture and sound qualityrates wayyyyy up there in comparison to some other BR movies. Do I care that there weren't any special features? Do I care that there's going to be a re-release in the fall that'll include all of this and more? Will I purchase it again? No I don't care about special features and no I don't care if it's going to be released again in the fall.Yes I will purchase that copy as well - the way I see it is this, I had all of the Pirates movies on DVD and when the BR came out I got them as well (well my wife got them for me as presents so what!) I never watch the DVD's but have them in case I want to see how dull DVD's are! I don't think that Fox has duped any of us and I don't know why some folks are quick to call ""foul"" it's their movie annnnd that gives them the right to do what they like.

1384309,"Sadly, Ronnie James Dio, one of the greatest, most distinctive singers in heavy metal, is no longer with us, having lost his battle with cancer, at the age of 67.  An articulate and intelligent man, Ronnie is remembered for his substantial musical legacy, his humbleness, and for the generosity and appreciation shown to his many fans throughout the years.Fortunately, one of Ronnie's last live performances with Heaven and Hell, was captured on Neon Nights: Thirty Years of Heaven and Hell (2010).  Recorded on July 30, 2009 in Wacken, Germany, the DVD does a great job of capturing the band, on what is a very good night.  The camera work is solid, with a good selection of angles of the outdoor stage.  The editing that is somewhat leisurely, without an excessive number of radical cuts.Each dressed in black, Dio, guitarist Tony Iommi, bassist Geezer Butler, and drummer Vinny Appice, are very loose and in exceptionally fine form.  A very slim looking Dio, appears quite spry and energetic.  His voice is as distinctive and powerful as ever, as Ronnie goes for the tough notes, only occasionally saving his voice.  Always the consummate frontman, Ronnie seems completely into the performance, and appears quite animated and emotional throughout the night, even swearing a few times.  Inspiring and magical, except for the profanity, it's precisely what you expect from Ronnie James Dio.Tony Iommi, the metal riffmaster, is rock solid, seamlessly transitioning from rhythm to lead guitar.  His solos are extremely tight, usually very close to what he recorded on the album versions.  There not much flash to Iommi, he's almost 100% substance.  A godfather of metal guitar, Tony seems to have tapped into the fountain of youth, looking fantastic at 61.  Onstage, Geezer Butler rarely moves, as his playing solidly anchors the band.  When Tony is soloing, Geezer always plays something that perfectly fills the void.  Vinny Appice, Ronnie's long time bandmate, is equally solid on the drums.  Somewhere out of sight, is Scott Warren on keyboards.The setlist predominantly draws from the classic Sabbath albums Heaven and Hell (1980), Mob Rules (1981), and Dehumanizer (1992).  From Heaven and Hell's album The Devil You Know (2009), the band performs Fear, Follow the Tears, and Bible Black.  The new music reveals that these men have mellowed very little with age.  Time Machine from Dehumanizer is a new addition to the traditional setlist.  The song Heaven and Hell, is usually an  improvisational number, and the 17 minute extended version preformed here is one of the high points, complete with spouting flames.  It's a killer show, and Ronnie and Tony in particular, are just outstanding.The DVD also includes individual interviews with the band members, reflecting back on the thirty years since Ronnie James Dio first joined Black Sabbath.  What is said is of particular interest, given Dio's untimely death.  As always, Ronnie displays nothing but class, taking the high road.  Also included are brief interviews with the remaining members, recorded after Ronnie's passing.The band had previously released another concert DVD,Heaven & Hell: Live from Radio City Music Hall(2007).  Also highly recommended, this DVD captures another great performance (114 minutes), at another renowned venue.  It includes songs from Sabbath's Dio Years reunion album, and classics like Voodoo, Lonely Is The Word, The Sign of the Southern Cross, Computer God, and Lady Evil, all of which are not performed during the Wacken concert.Ronnie James Dio's on and off relationship with Black Sabbath spanned three decades, and was both magical and tumultuous.  After departing from Rainbow, Dio joined Black Sabbath in 1979, replacing the legendary Ozzy Osbourne.  Together with Iommi, Butler, and drummer Bill Ward, the new Black Sabbath producedHeaven & Hell, a bona fide milestone in heavy metal.  This was followed byMob Rules, andLive Evil(1982), featuring Vinny Appice on drums.In the early 80's both Dio and Appice ended up out of Sabbath, and Ronnie formed his own band Dio, with Vinny on drums much of the time.  After nearly a decade as a successful solo artist, Dio and Appice rejoined Black Sabbath, recording the severely underrated albumDehumanizer.  After which, for the second time, Dio and Appice left Sabbath and reformed the Dio band.Reuniting again, under the name Heaven And Hell, Iommi, Dio, Butler, and Appice recorded The Devil You Know.  The future looked promising for all concerned, when Dio tragically passed away.  To the one born Ronald James Padavona, who became world famous as Ronnie James Dio, and meant so much, to so many, may he truly rest in peace.",Neon Nights: 30 Years of Heaven & Hell- Live in Europe

653375,"A woman with no past returns to Russia in search of her parents, but instead finds her long lost twin when she arrives at their parent's deserted farm house. As the two start off to find answers from their shrouded past, they uncover the ghosts of the past along with their evil doppelgangers that hope to trap their souls in after escaping death decades earlier. THE ABANDONED is very light on dialog but heavy on aesthetics and mood. Its cool green and blue filters build on the dilapidated sets and foggy exteriors to maintain the creepy atmosphere throughout the entire film. Director Nacho Cerda has an excellent cinematic eye, which he uses to create several effective shots. Faint images of the ghosts are revealed throughout the house when the flashlights quickly pass over them, and in a dramatic climax, Cerda also employs the use of reverse photography to watch as the ruinous sets rebuild themselves in frame. The ghastly doppelgangers that stalk the house also instill an intense fear through their silent movements and blank stares. Stronger characters and writing could have made this an instant hit, but the visuals alone make this one worth the watch!-Carl ManesI Like Horror Movies",The Abandoned

1379344,"Some of us can remember a time not long ago when it seemed unthinkable that a classic Disney animated feature would be shown on TV at all, and with the rare exceptions of Dumbo and Alice in Wonderland (which was edited), they were not broadcast for decades but only reissued to theaters.When home video came along, again it seemed out of the question that Snow White, Sleeping Beauty -- and especially Fantasia -- would ever, ever be released on VHS tape. Now it's become a nostalgic memory to recall the fervor that arose when, one by one, they all did become part of many home libraries.The release of Fantasia was always an event when I was growing up because Disney didn't release it nationwide with a big ad campaign. It just suddenly appeared every few years in theaters and each time, seeing it was like living through a multi-sensory experience. It's not like a movie, per se, but more of a journey.When it was issued on VHS, it was a huge seller. Surely Walt Disney, who was apparently disappointed throughout his life that the public never embraced Fantasia the way he dreamed they would, might have felt some closure. It was the success of the VHS sales that helped Roy E. Disney convince Michael Eisner to green light what became Fantasia 2000.This new multi-DVD/Blu-Ray package combines both films for the first time. If you didn't get the DVD last time, do not hesitate this time because it should be in every home. If you want to see and hear it as never before -- plus finally get a look at the fabled Disney/Dali collaboration, Destino, this may be the thing that tips the scales in favor of getting that Blu-Ray player for a holiday gift.There is nothing like Walt Disney's Fantasia, including its countless imitators. You never run out of things to notice with each viewing. And thanks to the generous audio commentaries and supplemental materials, you can gain an even greater insight into what a mammoth enterprise Walt Disney had the tenacity to take on. It was produced during a period when his artists were at the peak of their form and right before the strike and the war changed things forever.Some of my own little notes about the original Fantasia:Ever notice how many characters are waking up and going to sleep? What's that big blocky thing going down the hallway in ""Toccata and Fugue?"" (Even Roy didn't know.) How many action, horror and sci-fi movie scores must have borrowed elements of ""The Rite of Spring?"" And was I the only person in the late '60s/early '70s who burst out laughing during ""Dance of the Hours,"" not because of the funny hippos and ostriches, but because Allan Sherman used the tune for ""Hello Muddah, Hello Fadduh?""It's fitting that Fantasia 2000 is being reissued to the public after Waking Sleeping Beauty, in which we learned more detail about Roy E. Disney's pivotal role in turning the Disney corporate tides, and then seeing and hearing him as a major guiding force behind this film, which was very much a personal triumph for him.The miracle is that such an ambitious project as Fantasia 2000 is excellent, too, combining reverence for the original film and its techniques with the newest innovations. How can you not admire the brilliant ""Rhapsody in Blue,"" the hysterical flamingos, the lush and lovely ""Firebird"" sequence, and the rest?The live-action 2000 ""interstitials,"" though largely amusing to diffuse the stuffiness that one might have found in the 1940 Deems Taylor hosting duties, will probably date 60 years from now, too, with several of the celebrities being obscured by time and generations, but they are there merely for marquee value and are fine.My only quibble is that Bette Midler seems a little too flip and dismissive of the early Fantasia sequences that were considered then dropped from the original. Nothing against her, but the segment comes across as if these lost concepts were all ""losers,"" reducing these ideas to mere eye-rollers, like the one about ""Salvador Dali and baseball."" It kind of flies in the face of the years of effort Roy put into restoring Destino and to the countless artists whose work was deleted for reasons other than ""dumbness."" It's a cute segment, and she is charming as ever, but it just seems a little insensitive.The new audio commentary by the always welcome historian Brian Sibley is, as expected, richly detailed with endless facts about every minute of the 1940 film, along with mini bios on the artists involved. Some of it overlaps with earlier commentary from other historians, particularly John Canemaker, but if you don't have a Blu-Ray, you only get the new one and not the two earlier ones.The two earlier Fantasia commentaries are wonderful because they feature Roy, Canemaker and ""2000"" Conductor James Levine on one, and Canemaker again on the other one with none other than Walt Disney himself in various clips, plus spot-on readings of his notes by an astonishingly gifted voice actor, who also redubbed Deems Taylor when the restored footage was found to be missing a lot of original audio.[Note to collectors: If you have the three-disc Fantasia Collection DVD set, you'll probably still want to keep it, though, because there are still a lot of extras, like all the concept art and background materials, that were included on the Fantasia Legacy disc that are not in the new package.The most touching moment, for me, came when the audio commentary for ""The Sorcerer's Apprentice"" started, and there was  Roy talking with Mickey Mouse, performed in the vocal persona who we have had the pleasure of enjoying for the past several decades. This was the Mickey I have personally witnessed doing radio interviews at various Disney events, filled with good humor and crackling wit. What a wonderful treat and what a irreplaceable treasure to have now.So what's the big deal with Destino? Well, it is a big deal because it was considered unfinished and never to be completed. With the help of John Hench, who worked with Walt and Dali originally, and again Roy's dogged determination, it was completed with the original soundtrack intact (it's a Latin pop love ballad, by the way, sung by Dora Luz, who sang ""You Belong to My Heart"" in The Three Caballeros. It is strange? Weird? Disturbing? Nutso? Oh yeah! But how cool! And what a miracle that this once-in-a-millennium collaboration survived and we can actually see it at home!One last note : on the commentary for the interstitials for Fantasia 2000, producer Don Hahn talks about the design of this otherworldly concert hall, with its ""sails"" carrying images around the frames (and on the selection menus).How appropriate that a film that is so much a result of the teaming of Roy E. Disney with great Disney artists, past and present, should have ""sails,"" since sailing was his passion?Along with Disney heritage and legacy, of course.",N/A

728769,"This movie is so bad, it's good. As a matter of fact, it is collectible! You will enjoy seeing two of the sexiest, hotest, most attractive people on earth move around each other as if they were furniture pieces from different sets, with absolutely no sensuality, or attraction of any type whatsoever, as a matter of fact, when Brando finally grabs Sophia for a kiss I thought he was going to slap her.Sophia looks gorgeous in every scene and outfit, which includes two different sets of Brando pajamas, one of which comes in an unusually strident shade of yellow that is particularly hideous. Her hair is perfect, eventhough she is staying in this cabin with nothing of her own as she arrived wearing an evening gown and a small purse that could fit a lipstick, maybe two. Yet in every scene she looks as if she had walked out of Alexandre de Paris' salon for a blow and dry. Noticing the capricious falling of her curls or the twist of her hair endings was my pastime in this movie that has one of the worst scripts ever written.  She acts her part as a Russian Countess fallen on bad times in the Orient very nicely, there is an iceness to her character that she conveys quite well. At her staged wedding with Brando's valet, which she has to go through to get entry into the US, she looks amazing in a pale green dress that is five times bigger than her size, but she manages to wrap it in a knot at the waist front , folding the long sleeves chinese style for a few minutes in which she makes you believe this is haute couture. When Sophia dives from the ship to her freedom she is wearing a perfectly tropical-patterned bathing suit and, yes, her hair dries out PERFECTLY in place, as if a hair-dressing angel was doing it for her.The furniture and sets in this film are the epitome of bad taste. Everything looks cheap, including the wood paneling in the boat's 'lavish' suite' where most of the action takes place. The pale-lavender sofas of the suite can only be imagined in the context of a provincial funeral parlor. The mustard coloring of the ballroom of the ship and the unfortunate costumes in most of the first class passengers can only be described as painful. Warning: The latticed work in most of the wall spaces in this film, as well as ""tropical"" rattan cheap-furniture can induce vomiting if you have not been frequently exposed to suburbian furniture.Brando was exasperated with his character, as he always looks bored and on edge. His pale-coral-rose lipstick and bronze makeup really show up in high definition and it looks funny. His clothes are particularly unattractive, except for his tux, yet he always looks great. Tippi Hedren plays Brando's wife Martha, and we could see here an early prototype for Albee's Virginia Wolf: A spoilt, unhappy, bitter and consistently annoying privileged creature who comes into the picture with two closets of luggage and a french maid that looks more like a lesbian companion or top model in between jobs, as a matter of fact her name in the credits is simply ""Balbina"" so she was a model or a well known courtesan. Tippi enjoys her role and plays it to the hilt, making a strong case for the failure of marriage in modern bourgeois society, her brief dialogue concentrates on denigrating Sophia's character, her husband, or both. Her presence is consistently bitchy and in seconds one can understand why her marriage is on the rocks, though it probably already started there. She does come out at one point with an exquisite Indian silk gown with gold patterns to match her conversation about Saudi Arabia which marks her only redeeming contributionIt was a schock for me to discover that Charles Chaplin was the director, as I thought this was the definitive bad Holywood movie, but then again, doesn't this depth of things wrong point to greatness?? The theme song, composed by Chaplin, which I loved, and later discovered was a GREAT hit, is also a reason to watch this movie, over and over.",A Countess From Hong Kong

For me, many of her moves are unique.Pros:- I like the chair routine because it reminds me of barre.- I like the arm routine because it kills my arms doing them.- I like TA has unique moves- lots of repetition, so you really feel the burnCons:- As many mentioned, there should be more instructions especially the isolation in the ribcage and leg routines. Sometimes I don't want to look at the tv screen all the time and I listen for cues for example to switch legs or if she wants us to look down and I like to wait for the next cue but TA already moves on without a word.- Not sure if I'm doing the leg routine correctly because of the minimal instructions.I will continue to add this dvd to my workout because I like to do different routines and workouts.

762689,"This DVD contains two New Order concerts, spanning 17 years; one of their first gigs at the Ukranian National Home in New York in 1981, and their ""comeback"" gig at Reading Festival in 1998. While the Reading gig is okay, the real highlight is the 1981 show, and while New Order where an inconsistent live band, this DVD is worth buying for the 1981 show alone.This early NYC concert shows an inexperienced New Order still finding their feet. The stage is lit in cold blues and greens, a nervous-looking Bernard Sumner stares rigidly out over the audience or hunches over his guitar, Peter Hook stands half-turned with his back to the crowd, a gothic Gillian Gilbert hovers in the background looking like Siouxsie Sioux, while Stephen Morris works up a sweat on the drums. Highlights include an intense take on 'Truth', a great 'Everything's Gone Green', and an extended take on a primitive 'Temptation'. It's also pleasing to hear all the 'Movement' songs in a live setting, where they aren't victim to Martin Hannett's claustrophobic production. 'Senses' in particular sounds more direct here than on the album.The 1998 Reading concert is a complete contrast. Here are a bunch of professional musicians, with Bernard Sumner acting like a real frontman, and the band turning in a solid performance. Like most other reviewers, I don't regard this as anywhere near as interesting as the 1981 concert; it's a workmanlike performance of well-known songs by a professional live act. Also, the track listing is ordinary, with songs like 'Paradise', 'World In Motion', and 'Touched By The Hand Of God' hardly being New Order classics. The obvious highlights of this concert are the takes on the three Joy Division songs, which for the most part are worthy of the originals, especially 'Heart And Soul' and a driving 'Isolation', although they're marred by Bernard Sumner's vocal ""whoops"".In all, this is a DVD of contrasts, from the naive youngsters of the early gig to the professional musos of the latter show. As I say, the 1981 concert is endlessly fascinating for its portrayal of a young band still establishing their sound, and for interesting live takes on early New Order tracks. The latter gig is professional but nothing special, but the earlier show is worth the price of purchase alone.",N/A

1037613,"I have mixed reviews about shortbus.  I heard about it here on amazon because of all the rave reviews and the appeal of the sexuality. In retrospect, I am confused on all the perfect reviews of this movie.  Beware! There are spoilers!From the beginning scene to the end, I was definitely enthralled and did not look away.  I am not used to seeing sex on film so raw, so real, so gay (sorry but I've never seen a gay porn) yet not be a porn movie.  For the most part, I thought the actors and actresses did a remarkable job.  How brave they all must be to bare all in a non-porn setting!  And I certainly admire the vision, or at least my interpretation of the vision, which is to show sex and relationships in a way Hollywood will never grant us--lifelike.  I like that it tries to demolish the uptight American view of sexuality and catch us up with the rest of the world (Europe, anyway.)  And I like that this movie was seemingly made for women and gay men; although I'm straight I liked the openness and relaxed nature that Hollywood would never portray to this audience.  The actors and actresses were very beautiful but in a realistic way; the female form never looked so good and was paired with men and women alike, without the unbelievable airbrushing and body doubles in movies today.  And it was kind of nice that the penis was not the forbidden genital like in all our movies outside of porn.  But there many things I did not particularly like- at times the story and the acting were lacking.The story I liked at times but overall it felt shallow and poorly thought out.  And some things did not make a lick of sense.  A sex therapist that is pre-orgasmic and blows up at her clients, physically assaulting them?  And after, following them to a sex club without her love being aware?  What sense did it make that Jennifer (sorry severin) formed a bond with our troubled sex therapist by taking a polaroid of an unbelievable dialogue between Sofia and a group of strangers?  I guess the therapist had no awareness that her view on sex and her sex life was sad, pathetic, and misguided.Rob seemed to be pretty damn carefree regarding Sofia's actions throughout the whole movie.  I don't know if this was poor writing or acting.  I also like how Sofia never consulted her true love one time before kissing or touching strangers.  Nor did most of the characters for that matter, save James and Jamie, and their ease of bringing a stranger into the relationship was totally unbelievable.And the vibrator scene?  Completely ridiculous.  In this scene both Sofia and Rob failed miserably in selling this to the audience.And the worst part of this movie by far was the stalker.  Wow.  Anything to do with that poorly written and performed character was completely unbelievable and laughable.  He works from home and has been watching and following everyone for years without anyone noticing.  Right.  I don't care if you're gay or straight or what- you would call the cops in a second and be furious if you found that you had a stalker.  Why did Jamie have sex with him at the end of the movie? And why did his frantically worried partner smile at him across the alleyway?  Don't you think James would have been a little upset?  Thanks for the call to let me know you're alive Jamie, and I'm glad your sleeping with a creep 20 feet from our place.I'm glad Sofia finally discovered an orgasm; you'd think being a sex therapist and all she'd have the resources or at least be able to seek professional assistance to resolve this before now.The ending... How disappointed I was to see everything wrapped up in a neat little happy package at the end of the movie just like all our Hollywood mainstream movies.I know this review is harsh especially in comparison to the others, and I know that alot of hard work was put into this, but overall it was just ok and it certainly doesn't deserve all the perfect ratings.",Shortbus

Woolf herself wrote of the impact of the abuse she had suffered, she read  her paper '22 Hyde Park Gate'  to the Memoir Club and described the assaults by her half brother George Duckworth, which lasted through her adolescence and young woman hood, which had "" spoilt her life for her before it had fairly begun"".There is much more detail on her often cruel and neglectful family etc. but the thing I have to wonder about is why there is never one mention of any of this in the movie.I still would recommend this movie to anyone, The acting is astoundingly good.......very profound and it touches on how everyday life can be so difficult for some people.....issues about how to deal with greif, forgivness, the ability to go on with life and experience the moments of good that are around you none the less.......and the healing effect of understanding .....The entire film is beautifully done, the actors give wonderful performances, I would say that this is the best work ever done by nicole kidman and julianne moore.drama, 20th century american fiction, virginia woolf, aids, meryl streep, julianne moore, los angeles, nicole kidman, california",The Hours

I was amazed at the sharpness of the occasionally surreal comedy and of the fast paced and clever script, that surprised and amazed in equal measure.However, the scene where our hero chats up the female lead is the 'Jump the Shark' moment, where the film turns from ground breaking to cliched and predictable. All the special effects in the world can't make the final match work, and the whole enemy-team-on-drugs ploy doesn't explain why they are so much better than the Shaolin monks.Anyways, the film is definitely worth watching as all new experiences are to be cherished and honoured.

575953,"Once upon a time, on an Irish island so small that it didn't appear on the maps, there lived these three priests... yeah, it sounds like the setup for a joke or a really bad religious story. Fortunately it turns out to be the theme for ""Father Ted - Complete Series 1,"" a kooky comedy about some painfully unholy priests -- moderately crude, quite goofy, and full of insanity.On Craggy Island, there's a single Catholic parish run by three priests -- long-suffering Father Ted (Dermot Morgan), half-witted  Father Dougal (Ardal O'Hanlon), and deranged foul-mouthed lecherous alcoholic Father Jack (Frank Kelly). They also have a crazy housekeeper obsessed with tea. The priests aren't exactly holy, since all three have been exiled there for various misdeeds.And as the show opens, Father Ted receives a call from the TV show ""Faith of Our Fathers,"" who wants to come to Craggy Island and interview him. Of course he tries to keep Dougal and Jack from finding out, but his efforts to keep this interview secret go horribly awry.Among their other problems: Ted and Dougal deal with a guest priest who is devastatingly boring, protest the blasphemous pornographic film ""The Passion of St. Tibulus"" at the hostile bishop's demand, and babysit an alcoholic TV host while preparing for a costume competition. Additionally, Ted develops a crush on a sexy author, and Father Jack is found seemingly dead after chugging a bottle of floor polish.Small warning: ""Father Ted"" is definitely not for anyone who wants an all-sparklyhappysunshiny depiction of Catholic clergy, because... well, there's a reason these guys were exiled to Craggy Island. Except for despair, I'm pretty sure the priests on this show manage to commit all the seven deadly sins, plus Dougal's unofficial sin of mind-blowing idiocy.And it's quite funny. It's not quite as funny as ""Blackadder"" or ""Fawlty Towers,"" but it's got plenty of entertaining stuff here. There's lots of slapstick, strange problems (""Ah no, not Toilet Duck again!"") and the priests being rather unpriestly (""Father."" ""Yes Tom?"" ""I killed a man."" ""Did you, Tom? I'll have to talk to you later. I'm doing an interview for the television"").And there are some running jokes that push the series just over the line into ""surreal"" -- Father Dougal somehow became a priest despite no solid belief in God, religion, the afterlife or anything except TV celebrities. Not to mention Jack's crazy drunken rants, a couple who constantly inflicts bloody injuries on each other, and Mrs. Doyle's obsession with tea and sandwiches.Morgan is quite good as the ""straight man"" of the cast, who is the most normal despite having stolen charity money -- he's constantly dealing with the idiocy around him with a kind of resigned patience (""He loved children... they were terrified of him, though""). O'Hanlon is thoroughly entertaining as the peabrained Dougal, Kelly makes a wonderful gnarled old drunken coot (""NUNS! NUNS! Reverse! Reverse!""), and Jim Norton has a small role as a hostile bishop with a dirty little secret.""Father Ted - Complete Series 1"" features the worst Catholic parish in the world, if you consider both priests and parishioners.

1269007,"Leslie Sansone's ""Walk Off Even More Weight"" has two two-mile walks that you do using a weight belt, which comes with the DVD.  The first walk is a Classic Walk - you move at a 15 minute per mile pace (4 mph).  The second walk is a Fast Walk - you move at a 12 minute per mile pace (5 mph).  Each workout gives you the option of doing just the first mile, just the second mile, or the full 2 miles.  Also included on the DVD is a five-minute energy boost walk.Hosted by just Leslie with no other walkers, the Classic Walk features all the Leslie Sansone standards (warm-up, cool down and the four basic steps: walk in place, sidesteps, kicks and knee lifts).  Since it is a two-mile walk she also adds a few more intense movements (especially in the second mile), including tap outs that turn to lunches and single knee lifts, double knee lifts, and four knee lifts.  About seven minutes into the walk you put on the weight belt which you wear for the rest of the program, including the cool down. While the belt doesn't feel all that heavy while wearing it you can definitely feel it working especially after the workout is over and you take it off.The Fast Walk (again hosted just by Leslie) is an intense workout - you wear the weight belt from the very start until cool down.  The moves are faster and more intense - for example, instead of walking back and forth you almost jog instead of walk.  In addition to the four basic steps, you do things like walk, walk, walk, tap; power kicks (almost like hopping and kicking); tap outs that turn to lunches; single knee lifts, double knee lifts, and four knee lifts; heel down; and mini-squats.  Leslie also adds a few things not usually done in her two-mile workouts -- notably a movement where you open up your feet and shift your weight from side to side (a lot of fun) and grapevines in place of double sidesteps - all of this helps add to the intensity of the workout.The Bonus Energy Boost Walk is a quick five minute fast walk.  There is no warm up or cool down and you don't use the weight belt but it uses these typical Leslie moves: walk in place, sidesteps, kicks, knee lifts, walk forward and back, double knee lifts.  Leslie also gives quick energy tips such as get plenty of sleep, make sure you eat breakfast, take a multivitamin etc.""Walk Off Even More Weight"" is one of my favorite Leslie Sansone exercise DVDs.  While I found both routines to be beneficial I tend to use the Fast Walk the most because it is more intense and I feel like I've gotten a really good workout after using it.  The weight belt adds just the right extra boost to make the workout feel even more intense.  The workout may not be the best for beginners, but is more for those who are used to Leslie's workout (especially since she's not always good at telling you what move to do next, instead she simply moves into the next step).  While I like the belt it takes a little getting used to when taking it on and off - especially taking it off during the Fast Walk when your hands may be sweaty.  Also, the set Leslie uses can be a bit distracting - it is mostly mirrors and windows and you can see the cameraman in the mirrors.""Walk Off Even More Weight"" has two good two-mile walks that make for an excellent workout.",Walk Off Even More Weight

The direction on this is fabulous, the acting, the story, the pacing, the cinematic appeal...  It's really an interesting perspective, retelling a Nazi-era drama, though as one should expect, the underlying details are gritty, ugly, and sometimes gross.

1303718,"I was excited about this, for god knows why.  I mean, I have grown tired of Sandler, and I was never really a fan of Schneider, but Spade and Rock and particularly James have always made me laugh, or at least smile, so the prospect of seeing them all together in a `no holds bar' type family comedy seemed interesting, and promising.  In the end though, this film is just awkward.  Sandler has forgotten how to edit and doesn't know when to stop pushing a good thing when he has it.  When you have scenes to establish friendships that consist of nothing more than five minutes of verbal jokes at friends expenses it becomes tired, redundant and, sadly, unfunny.  This also felt like a lazily constructed comedic version of `Why Did I Get Married' too, and that's saying a lot since Tyler Perry's film was pretty lazily put together itself.  The acting is hit or miss, but acting isn't the point here.  It is the endless gags that suffer from being too overly compacted to the point where the audience never gets a break.  It works in that you don't have time to dwell on the failed gags before one that marginally works catches your eye, but in the end `Grown Ups' feels hugely uninspired and preposterous.  The whole `warm family moments' don't ring true and the loopy development of the actual families is so blatantly obviously manufactured that it takes away from the films marginal appeal.  Thankfully Kevin James is funny and Maria Bello is hot.  Outside of those two positives, `Grown Ups' is a clich&eacute;d mess of a film.  The only reason I'm not giving it an F is because I kind of feel like this film is exactly what it wanted to be.",N/A

1294659,"People, ignore 99% of the one-star reviews. Many of them were posted weeks before this package was even released! A bunch of people who trashed the movie on the other Avatar movie product pages, plus many complaining about no 3-D or double dipping, as if no other movie has ever been released as a barebones then an extended release later. Plus, it has been extensively written all over the internet that the 3-D version would not be released until next year. Amazon IMO should not allow reviews of products until after they are released. Avatar sure isn't the greatest movie ever made, but it fully deserves intelligent commentary, whether one gives it one star or five. I have never seen so many uninformed haters cluster around a movie before. People are even giving the movie one star because their BD players aren't updated with current firmware. All I can say about these people is what Neytiri said to Jake upon their first encounter... ""You're like a baby. Making noise, don't know what to do"".I loved the extras - this is one of those rare movies where the extras are as much fun as the movie itself - and wish a lot of the deleted scenes (many with unfinished CGI and some at the motion-capture level) had made it into the movie. It would have made the movie even longer, but almost 4 hours is not too long for this type of sci-fi epic, at least to me. However, the additional scenes that made it into the extended cut really added to the movie and helped clarify the plot. The Sturmbeest hunt scene was great, and lent a bit more legitimacy to the montage of Jake's improbably quick training. Another additional extended scene involving Grace and Jake really helped flesh out the backstory and also added an important element of bonding between the two characters.Seeing the feature-length ""making of"" documentary was wonderful - it really went in-depth on just how incredibly complicated the making of this movie was. Some of the deleted scenes with unfinished CGI are a bit tough to watch - very rough and cartoonish, and it can be difficult making out which character is which sometimes - and you kind of have to fill in with your imagination the missing CGI to get a sense of how the scenes fit into the movie. For those who aren't that familiar with the movie, it helps to get quite familiar with the storyline and scene-to-scene progression before delving into the deleted scenes.Two negatives:1) Amazon shipped me the DVD version, not the Blu-Ray version that I ordered! There's a lot of extras on the Blu-Ray set that are not on the DVD set so I was not a happy camper when I opened the package. Plus, I've already seen the original theatrical release on Blu-Ray and the video and audio quality of the DVD version is very noticeably downgraded. I already had removed the shrink wrap from the box before I noticed it was the incorrect format so I watched it all anyway. Amazon's problem, not mine. (Edit 11/19/10: Amazon got the correct (Blu-Ray) version to me in less than a day and a half after I filed a return ticket. Good job guys.)2) The case the set comes in, while beautiful, is not kind to the discs. In my opinion, having the discs lie against cardboard sliders is a great way to have the discs end up scuffed or scratched. As I said above, Amazon accidentally shipped me the DVD version when I had in fact ordered the Blu-Ray version, and since I didn't notice it was the DVD version until I had taken off the shrink wrap, I watched the DVD version anyway. As soon as I pulled out the discs I noticed seriously nasty scuff marks on the playing surfaces of two of the three discs (and yes, I WAS very careful). That is NOT acceptable for a freshly-manufactured product, and I had never encountered that problem before. When I received the Blu-Ray version, very luckily, there were no blemishes on any of the discs. So, I transferred them to standard Blu-Ray plastic cases for better safekeeping and now just keep the original case in a drawer. I have seen many other complaints from people here about how the cases marred their discs, so I know I'm not the only one. This is why I gave this set 4 stars, and not 5. My attitude is that when you're buying a product like a DVD/Blu Ray box set, it's not just about the movie itself, it's an overall PRODUCT review. When the package that the product is supposed to be permanently stored in causes damage to the product, then the packaging is fair game for being included in a review. You're not just buying the movie, you're also buying the case that is supposed to safeguard the disc(s). Almost everything is fair game in a review of a movie - audio, video, cinematography, editing, music, story line, continuity, acting - plus things like the extra bonus material and the case. ALL this is part of the overall product that people shell out their money for. So, I had to change my rating from 5 stars to 4. Movie 5 stars, packaging 3 stars.Overall, if you're a fan of the movie, don't hesitate to get this extended collector's edition. And if you're one of the people who complain double dipping and refuse to buy this version and just came here to complain about double-dipping, lack of 3-D, or your BD player not having updated firmware, feel free to take your complaints elsewhere.

1126041,"Super Robot Red Baron is an immensely entertaining item of televisual sci-fi culture from 1970s Japan. A group of young people work for a super-science organization that battles a crime syndicate / evil empire from space. Central to every episode is a climactic battle between the good-guy giant robot, Red Baron, and the equally enormous bad-guy robot-of-the-week. They fight it out, Godzilla-style, in an H-O scale landscape complete with model cities, refineries, factories, and little toy tanks that actually shoot. Generally speaking, the production values compare well to some shows from the same era, for example, Doctor Who of the 70s. There is a certain amount of the quirky-seeming (to western eyes) comic relief that is often present in Japanese productions. And while character development is limited, it is not altogether absent, and there are also moments of genuine drama and pathos. Most importantly, there are occasional flashes of visual brilliance. For example, in the series finale there are scenes of a surreal virtual reality beach and a clockwork throne room that would be at home in an episode of The Prisoner or in one of Andrei Tarkovsky's science fiction films.",The Super Robot Red Baron - The Complete Series

1159660,"Let's first look at the life of the film's producer Adam Sandler for a moment please(it will become clear very soon,I promise).We have a man who is clearly unattractive and unathletic but through pandering to the twits who actually like his films he was able to marry a hot model and live happily ever after(at least until he decides to be a schmuck and upgrade).Why the bio?Because 90% of Hollywood films are made by men like Sandler who cling to a fantasy that if they weren't wealthy and famous they would still have gorgeous women at their feet.Only the catch is that the women didn't start off that way.They were nerdy girls who stayed home on Friday nights memorizing pi and playing D&D;,but they were secret babes just waiting for their geeky dreamboat to come along, take their hair out of their ponytails and their glasses off and turn them into instant sexy Cinderellas.This is why when a film is made about geeky guys becoming cool and popular(a la ""Revenge of the Nerds"")they achieve their goal by staying true to themselves and actually create a new form of cool which is superior to what the sterotypical popular kids have to offer. Contrast this when the same situation is applied to the ladies:the only way they can become cool and popular is by conforming to society's standards,in short they must abandon a large part of themselves.The ""Nerds"" did not become popular by having Arnold show up,get the boys pumped and groomed;they made being a nerd popular.Why can't we have a film like that for women?If you've seen the trailor,you've basically seen the film(along with the only funny jokes):Playboy hangeron Shelly gets kicked out of the mansion on her 27th birthday (""That's 59 in bunny years"").She finds herself in search of a job and a place to live for the first time in her life(this does raise the question about all of Hef's discards who haven't managed to get knocked up by an athlete or B list actor.Is there a bunny retirement fund?),and follows whispers of a party to the local college campus.There she is rejected by the snotty sorority,but finds her place with a group of misfits,most of whom are obviously hot chicks who just dull down their looks with glasses,bad hair,and no makeup:redhead hottie,pierced hottie(Kat Denning is so gorgeous that even when they try to make her unattractive she still blows away 90% of Playmates and models out there),pregnant girl(at least a few months ago she was popular),lumberjack like manly girl,dwarf girl,mute foreign chick,and brace wearing girl(which brings me to my next point:this film wins the Tori Spelling award for nepotism for having not one but two actors who were hired for no other reason but their famous parents:Colin,son of Tom,Hanks and Rumour,daughter of Bruce and Demi,Willis.They are average at best in terms of talent).The girls decide to accept Shelly as their housemum because they need pledges and feel that the only way to get them is to make boys interested in them(huh?I might be clueless,but why?Can't you sell your house as the smart,nonsnotty sorority to girls who,imagine this,came to college to study and not party?Are there no pre-med or advanced science majors looking to join a sorority?).Shelly of course gives the girls ""Glamourshots""makeovers,throws wild parties(how did they pay for the Aztec party,I wonder?That had to be at least a couple grand),and teaches the girls that by acting like braindead tarts their lives will be complete.Along the way Shelly falls for Colin ""not quite Tom""Hanks and learns that there is life beyond the Playboy lifestyle.I know people who liked this film are going to get on me for taking it seriously,but I am sick to death of this genre.The scene where the girls are supposedly reclaiming themselves is very telling: ""Let's keep 60% Shelly"".What this says is that even when she is trying to be herself,she should only allow 40% of herself to come through to the outside world and 60% should be walking Barbie.And how about using girls with actual physical issues,not ones who only require 10 min. of makeup and hair?How about making an overweight girl or one with severe acne feel beautiful and sexy?That would take some guts to say that beauty comes in all forms, and let's face it,Hollywood doesn't have any.To say this film was moronic is to insult morons.I gave it one extra star for the Marilyn Monroe parody and the bunny age line(both of which are the funniest moments in the films and were in the trailor as was mentioned),but really,save yourself the waste of 90 min of your life and don't add any more money to Sandler's bloated wallet.Watch the trailor instead.All of the jokes with none of the garbage.",The House Bunny
1337022,"It's quite sad that a movie that was released in 2007 takes until October 2010 to get a BD release here, especially when it's this good. I guess that's not unusual for European films, especially subtitled ones, which it's deemed by someone to not be mainstream enough for US audiences?The story was broken up into two movies in 2007, and 2008 originally so to get the ""whole"" story so to speak, is almost worth the wait, albeit in truncated form.That being said, apparently the original version ( a truly lavish scale of production by European standards ) was released initially in a Mini Series format running about 6 hours in total, much like the original German version ofDas Boot - The Original Uncut VersionTo date, no plans have been made to make this version available, and although it is possible to get the original two movies - ARN: The Knight Templar, and ARN: The Kingdom at Roads End on DVD, they are hard to find, and in PAL format, or region 2 coded.Arn (played by Joakim Nattergvist) is based on the trilogy of books by Swedish author Jan Guillou, and although I have not read the books, I consider this adaptation to be a rare treat for fans of the genre.It's easy to quickly draw many comparisons with movies like ""Kingdom of Heaven"", and even the Lord of the Rings trilogy in some ways, partly due to the fact that the movie is so well made. The acting is great throughout, the locations impressive, and the battle scenes are graphic and realistic.Some will feel that the battle scenes are scant, even though they are done on a grand scale, but the story is about the struggle, not just the fighting.It's a story of two parts really.A young boy growing up in 12th century Sweden is taken by his parents to a monastery as he has an illness, and is not expected to reach adulthood.While there, he is taken under the wing of a monk who previously ""served God"" in the holy crusades, and he nurtures Arn's apparent natural talent with weapons to teach him the finer arts of fighting, swordplay and archery - something the youngster takes to well, aided by the fact he is naturally ambidextrous.Historically, much of Europe around the time the movie is set, was not as geographically delineated as it is today, many countries were a loose collection of warring fiefdoms, vying for power, land and the throne, and Sweden was no exception. It is during one such encounter that while defending his fathers honor, he makes an enemy of the powerful Svenger clan.Against the wishes of his family, the young Arn also falls in love with Cecilia, the daughter of a local family betrothed to the Svenger clan to help cement an alliance between the two most powerful families trying to control the country.Through lies and scorn he is sent to the Holy Land as a Crusader to do penance for 20 years, while his young bride to be is sentenced likewise for 20 years in a local convent, run by a vicious Abbess, who is sympathetic to the Svenger clan.Half of the movie centers on her struggle and life in Sweden, and the other on Arn's arduous and battle ridden path through the Holy land.I'm not going to go into much more detail than that really, and that's about as much information you would get from the movie trailer anyway, so not really a spoiler.Compressing three books into one movie, that runs just under two and a quarter hours, I'm sure will leave some plot holes for people who have read the books, but to me it felt very complete.It's also going to feel a little slow to some people, this movie is as much about love and family as it is about fighting and the crusades.despite these two points, I strongly recommend seeing this movie.There are those who will be put off by subtitles, although a large portion of the movie is in English. What is particularly well done is that all the characters speak their own language, Arabic, French, Swedish and English, clearly stated on screen with the subtitles, so it's easy to keep up.There are a few familiar faces US viewers will probably recognize, not least Stellen Skarsgard, but most I'm sure like me will be amazed that they haven't seen Joakim Nattergvist in anything before.This is top notch acting, whichever way you look at it, from the whole cast but particularly him.Focused, driven and really believable in the role, he seems to embrace all aspects of Arn's character.This feels to me like old fashioned story telling, with modern technology kept to a minimum. It feels ""Epic""If you like this kind of movie genre, see this film. 5 stars",N/A
472181,"**This is a review of the stand-alone Blu-ray release, not the Blu-ray/DVD combo set**I love a good heist film, and the heist sequences in this film are certainly fun to watch.  Where this film is weakest, however, is during scenes that thrust Rene Russo into the ""sexy femme"" spotlight.Former fashion model Russo is a competent but unexceptional actress.  Too many of her scenes, in particular her scenes in the police department and in the see-through evening gown, are presented with a rather heavy hand.  There might as well have been a big neon sign overhead that read ""This is where we focus on Rene's character's sexual aggressiveness and power"".  Not a hint of subtlety.  Very heavy-handed and, as a result, distracting.  Those are the weakest scenes in the movie.  She is very much objectified, presumably for the sake of having a ""hot over-40 woman"" angle to ""sex up"" the movie as a selling point.  And if you remember the pre-release marketing for this film, that is EXACTLY what the focus was on.As a tribute to the original version of TTCA, Faye Dunaway appears in the small and ultimately unimportant role of Thomas Crown's psychiatrist.  Dunaway's psychiatrist even mocks and laughs at Crown in one scene, a HUGE no-no in the psychiatric community.  All it shows it that her character was thinly written and conceived from the start.  Her character serves no real purpose to the story except as an unnecessary framing device and to satisfy some stunt casting.Believe it or not, the movie's most believable character is the police detective played by Denis Leary.Much attention was given to the love scenes between Brosnan and Russo's characters.  The first one took place largely on a marble floor and marble staircase.  It was meant to be hot and sweat-inducing, but all I could think of during that scene was how uncomfortable it must be to engage in that act on cold, hard marble.I saw the film in the theaters in 1999 and mostly enjoyed it.  As I said, I enjoy a good heist flick.  But I forgot that the heist itself was just a small part of a much longer film, and that the rest of the film has to have some sustainability to it.Watching it again in 2010 on the bargain-priced Blu-ray I purchased from a big box store, it was much less enjoyable.  When the ""will it work or won't it?"" question of the heists has already been answered in the first viewing, it shifts a larger load to the rest of the film:  is it solidly enough made/written to carry the viewer along for the other parts of the ride?  In many instances, no.And some of the product placement was less-than subtle too.  That can often be distracting too.For the film itself and the fact that the Blu-ray is a bare-bones edition with no extra features  (not even the director commentary that is included on the regular DVD), I give it 3 1/2 stars.  Director John McTiernan has done better, but he did so with material superior to this.",The Thomas Crown Affair VHS

Rennie and Duchovny have excellent on-screen chemistry, perhaps partly due to them being friends in real life, having bonded during the making of the second X-Files movie.The on-off relationship between Hank and Karen, played by 5'10"" actress Natascha McElhone, yields many moving and entertaining moments as Hanky panky fails miserably to resist the temptations of the flesh.I was disappointed that the interviews did not include more actors, such as the superb Callum Keith Rennie, but the main cast interviews are interesting.If you liked the first season, you should also like 2 and 3.

My take: it's a great series, and the box set is a great release.Make no mistake though, Red Dwarf is probably not for everyone.  I  highly recommend it to anyone who likes both Star Trek or Doctor Who type of sci-fi and wry British sit-coms (think insult-heavy ""Black Adder"").This is not a sweeping space opera.  Plot takes a back seat to the gag, and the focus is squarely on the characters. Dialogue is well-written, the small cast is appealing, and some of the episode set-ups are quite clever.

911155,"When you watch The Card Player, you have to decide if you are going to see an old-school Argento giallo film, or a newer Argento slash-and-gore fest. I think it's best to plan on seeing a giallo, because as a giallo, The Card Player works.Argento's giallo movies never had the gore and visceral terror that his slasher flicks have. They are psychological, supernatural thrillers with a mystery at their center, and violence and gore kept to a minimum and used to further the plot, rarely becoming spectacular.All of the classic Argento giallo marks are there. The story is psychological cat-and-mouse of tracking down a serial killer who decides the fate of victims by whether the police win a game of poker with him. The police are helped by a psychic card player who has a strange ability to win. The Card Player also has the taut dialogue and psychological development of the central characters, the foreshadowing of future evil through stark symbols, and the use of camera angles and shot choice to heighten suspense.Perhaps returning to his roots was a mistake; Argento hasn't made a giallo since The Stendhal Syndrome, as far as I can remember. But I don't think it was a mistake; I think it's a chance to reintroduce us to a set of classic horror movies--Deep Red, Four Flies on Velvet, and the Bird with the Crystal Plumage.So, my recommendation is give it a try as a psychological horror-thriller; you may be pleasantly (or horribly?) surprised.",The Card Player

I was most definitely wrong and surprised at how wonderful this movie was.This has spoilers...(for those of you who are thin skinned about reading reviews and then complain because you read reviews which included the storyline.)I loaded up a 5 disc DVD player and put this one in last because I didn't expect much out of it... and to my surprise, it turned out to be the best movie in the stack. One of the most enjoyable movies I have seen in a while. I bought the normal DVD version of Journey to the Center of the Earth with Brendan Fraser. Nothing fancy. This was not a 3D version.There really was not a boring moment in the entire movie. It was fun, interesting, well written, well acted, well directed and had wonderful visuals and special effects. It was all unique and refreshing. I was glad they did not sour the movie with a bunch of unnecessary and unbelievable subterranean tribes or inhabitants like we see in other movies like this.Definitely a great family movie. No violence... other than that of the creatures they encounter... but that was also a nice feature. No blood, gore or killing of any characters in the entire movie. I really get tired of that in other movies. It is amazing how enjoyable a movie can be without those things.The story was fast paced, kept our interest and exciting to watch. The movie didn't dawdle too long in any one scene. The scenes were fresh, exciting and innovative and not repetitive of any previous movie versions. Anyone who has read my previous reviews knows I do not give out a review like this which is all positive. I usually have complaints even on my most favorite movies... but no negatives on this one on any aspect of it.For those of you who care about these things... the dialogue and gadgets were technically up to date with the times. So you won't have the teens complaining about it being old fashioned. But at the same time, it met all of the needs of the older audiences as well. It was a quality movie.The photography & sets were beautiful and unique. The action and story were fresh. The relationships between the three characters were well written and the actors were all wonderful in their roles. The nephew's role was scripted just right... and you don't often see that. Most movies have the kid too bratty. But they did a great job with this character of Sean as did the actor (Josh) who played him. His relationship with his uncle and his interactions were well written and acted and quite believable.The luminescent birds were a nice touch. I got a kick out of the ending with the bird. That was great. It is something I would have done in his place... so that was well received by the audience. The CGI barracudas and sea creatures were superb and very realistic. I liked the interaction they had with those nasty looking fish with the really hideous teeth. I remember seeing some fossils with similar teeth... so they were more realistic than most people might think since there isn't anything quite like that today.The magnetic rocks were a fun scene and quite unique. Bravo on the effects of the rock rotating. That was very realistic and would have been overlooked by most directors and special effects experts.But the best CGI scene was the one with the giant Venus flytraps. That was very realistic... and having him wrestle with them was well done.I will say that the mining cart scene was a little over the top. It was more like a Disneyland roller coaster ride. Thrilling effects which made it appear to be the ultimate roller coaster ride... but just a little beyond credibility when it jumped the chasm and all three separated cars landed perfectly on the tracks... Then a few minutes later did an impossible 3 direction split of 3 cars onto 3 tracks simultaneously which could not occur without rail switching, and even then, only one at a time per switch. However, other than taking a bit too much creative license... it was a thrilling scene with a lot of excitement. Same comments on the falling scene. A bit much on the extended falling like dropping out of the sky without a parachute and remaining in the fall for a ridiculous time period (similar to spy kids 3)... but they handled the end of the fall fairly well at the end.We especially thank the writer & director... for once, it was refreshing to see a character bring back the fringe benefits with them at the end of the movie. We really get tired of these movies where they find things like that and then lose them in the end. Finally! Someone got smart and actually brought back the goods and benefited from them. Thank you for not leaving the audience frustrated with the characters stupidity like we see in all the other movies.Very nice ending! The movie was a delight to watch from beginning to end.You'd have to be a real curmudgeon not to like it.

1271283,"A quietly superb film from Clint Eastwood, Invictus is another genre defying entry, from a director with a long track record of them, that is not quite a sports movie but neither is it a biography of its world famous central character Nelson Mandela.Anthony Peckham's clever script is nominally about Mandela's support - over fierce objections from his own party - for the hated national Springbok rugby team & how their improbable victory at the 1995 world cup finally overcame the bitter divisions of the apartheid era to unite the country at a point when civil war between blacks & whites looked inevitable.But what we have here is equally a subtle study in Mandela's brilliant grasp of strategy & leadership (he has his aides test him on the names of the Springboks so that when he meets them for the first time he can greet them like old friends) & his shrewd recognition that unless the black majority can demonstrate forgiveness to a sceptical & suspicious white minority - one that controls the banks, the police & the army - the country is doomed.Key to this is attracting much needed foreign investment (the eyes of the world are watching anxiously) & when Mandela learns that a billion people will be watching the rugby cup final he instantly grasps the PR significance of this for his country & for the world if the Springboks can win the cup.Freeman is impressively understated here not only capturing Mandela's physical mannerisms (the hunched shoulders from spending decades in a tiny cell) but also leaving it up to the audience to decide whether his public concern for those he must work with - expressed through a succession of carefully calibrated speeches - is genuine or simply the work of a brilliant tactician shrewdly exploiting his media image as a saint. There are hints, here & there, of Mandela's estrangement from his own family & these touchingly remind us that behind the public image is a man who paid a very high personal price for his actions.A convincingly beefed up Matt Damon is also excellent as the Springbok Captain Francois Piennar. Francois doesn't pretend to understand the politics of the situation but he can intuit immediately that the situation he's in concerns something far greater than just a sports victory as he tries to convince his sceptical team mates. As per Freeman it's delightfully understated acting & it's a very good demonstration of Damon's versatility.There's also a satisfying parallel storyline to Mandela's efforts which centres on his bodyguards. These guys are perpetually fearful of an assassination attempt & it's a task not made any easier by Mandela's habit of wanting to leave his entourage to go on impromptu walkabouts in the crowds. His security detail are a mixed team of black & whites who on first meeting view each other with barely disguised hostility. Indeed, on their initial encounter the first question out of the mouth of the black guard is 'Have you come to arrest me?'! In the hands of a lesser director & writer this would have descended into cringe-making backslapping & we're-all-brothers-under-the-skin proclamations, but Eastwood is too good a director to fall for this & the slow recognition that both teams are on the same side simply develops organically, without ever seeming forced.The climactic rugby scenes are satisfyingly crunchy, clearly filmed (there's a refreshing absence of Paul Greengrass-style shaky-cam shots) & the gist of the game is communicated clearly even if the specifics remain obscure. There's also a jaw-dropping scene involving a 747 Jumbo that is one of those outrageous moments so WTF? that it could only have come from real life (& indeed did actually happen).The stadium sequences depicting thousands of cheering supporters are pretty staggering & demonstrate just how far crowd software has come since Gladiator's famous arena shot. As impressive as that was I always felt there was something not quite right about it but the CG crowds packing Ellis stadium here are completely convincing, indeed overwhelming at times. Invictus is also, I think, superbly edited & it seemed to go by remarkably quickly for a two hour plus movie.As for Eastwood, he's a directorial marvel avoiding so many of the pitfalls inherent in this kind of material. There's no sense of self- importance about Invictus. The film is epic & yet intimate, if that makes any sense. It wears its themes lightly, as if aware that the material is so strong it doesn't need amping up. Eastwood's understated, unemphatic approach amusingly drives the lazy, the impatient & the immature viewer up the wall but I find his firm, gentle style so stirring it had me welling up with tears on more than one occasion.Whether it's Francois telling his stunned family he's been invited to tea with Mandela, an absolutely exquisitely judged sequence on the infamous penal colony of Robben Island, where Francois imagines Mandela reciting Invictus in his tiny cell, a blink & you'll miss it moment as a tough white bodyguard hurriedly puts his sunglasses on to hide the fact that he's tearing up at his team having reached the final, or gently underscoring the reconciliation theme by crosscutting the climactic match with a black kid outside the stadium slowly edging closer to a group of white cops listening to the match on their car radio, Eastwood makes this kind of ambitious filmmaking, so littered with obvious booby traps look so bloody easy.Granted Invictus is unabashedly feel good but there's nothing wrong with that provided it's as well done as it is here. It's a film that leaves you buzzing & although corny to say it - yep - uplifted. Recommended, but do try & catch it on the biggest screen you can.",N/A

Not only his friends but also all though that came before him and is told to those that came after him.A quick synopsis is that Old Hamlet conquered Old Fortinbras seizing his land. Now that Old Hamlet is dead, Young Fortinbras wants his land back and is willing to take it by force. Meanwhile back in D&auml;nemark Young Hamlet who is excessively grieving for the loss of his father, gets a now insight from his father&#8217;s ghost.

The hand full of true Shakespearian actors at least can say their lines well. The other actors just squeak it out.  I was never a fan of modernizing Shakespeare unnecessarily.

554110,"This was one of the most unpleasant experiences in hearing and watching an opera DVD.  This looked and sounded as another casualty of experimental German productions, although in costumes and staging this was extremely conservative.  I knew for long that Salieri was a master in comical operas, but this was not funny at all - it all looked like rather an austere burlesque at some country fair, with gray dull colors and boring looks.What added gravely to that impression is that there was no one good voice here!  How could it be?  Master Ford, the tenor, was shockingly awful in his opening aria, and never better later.  All female voices were screeching with various degree of abominable;  they also are made to play in a very dull and dumb manner.  If there was anything witty and funny in Shakespeare, nothing remained of it.  Indeed, time better spent would be just to read the play and leave acting and sound to imagination.I am not sure why this opera seemed so poor.  My exposure to Salieri was quite limited, and came mostly from listening to Diana Damrau's mixed recording of Mozart, Salieri and Righini arias.  However, Salieri was very popular in his time, and even preferred to Mozart, so it could not be so bad.  I expected much more musically, and maybe it was not just the best opera by Salieri, while nothing could really remedy the very mediocre troupe of singers.  In addition, I am not sure if it was really a good idea to make Falstaff look simply repulsive - sometimes these German post-modernist take things too literally, and the ugliness of this Falstaff was too true, with nothing funny about it.  Also, these supposed ""Merry Wives of Windsor"" looked more like Witches as well. Grim and morose hues were stiffing. Thus, in addition to being so disappointing vocally, this production was not pleasant visually as well.The only benefit to me was to hear to my amazement how much Rossini there was; it seems that the entire ""Pace E Gioia Sie Con Voi""  from ""Il Barbiere di Siviglia"" Gioachino just borrowed from here, as he is quite famous to do - borrowing from himself and obviously others.  Also one could hear occasional Mozart in this ""Falstaff"" - from ""Le nozze di Figaro"", perhaps, and some hints from ""Don Giovanni"" and ""Cosi fan tutte"".  Surely the reciprocal influence of Salieri-Mozart can be well-appreciated in this otherwise a poor production.Recommended for educational purposes only.",N/A
1297831,"Vigilante/Revenge/Justice movies started to be big box office draws in the 70s with movies like Death Wish, in which Charles Bronson extracts street justice with his pistol after the murder of his wife and rape of his daughter. This genre of movie, having to take the law in your own hands due to the failings of the justice system, is also seen inMan on Fire,Ransom (Special Edition)and the Dirty Harry movies. Law Abiding Citizen goes the James Bond route that I haven't seen in one of these movies yet. Yes, Cresey in Man of Fire (both versions) was an  ex-military/agent type, but this movie takes that to the Nth degree with lots of high tech gear. Its like a game of chess and the DA has no idea they are even playing. And as with some of these movies, the person exacting revenge/justice starts going overboard, ""Biblical"" was the term used. So the person you are cheering for at the beginning of the movie starts to look like the bad guy later in the movie.

323856,"In Bruges, in 1930, a bright and willful young woman (Audrey Hepburn) enters a convent and undergoes rigorous training for the religious life.  As Sister Luke, her dream of serving as a nurse in the Belgian Congo is finally realized, but she develops a life-threatening illness.  When she eventually returns to the strict confines of the mother house, her years-long struggle to follow the rule of obedience and the outbreak of WWII bring about a crisis of conscience.I first saw this movie in 1960 and it had a huge effect on me; I'm glad to say I found it every bit as powerful today.  It is a deeply reverential look at traditional religious life and a fine character study of a young woman who strives to conform to the restraints of her vocation.  Audrey Hepburn is so young and serenely beautiful and shows great emotional range; I'm sure she inspired many girls to consider religious life.Partially filmed in Belgium and the Congo, the movie is beautiful and timeless.

990968,"I am unfortunately one of those people that never saw the live performance. Seeing something live helps you appreciate the most minimal staging. So I have nothing to compare and found this an obstruction when concentrating on the music and the story.Based on a play"" Iphigenia in Tauris"" by Greek dramatist Euripides this presentation in four acts was composed by Christoph Willibald von Gluck (July 2, 1714 - November 15, 1787).Even if this is your first foray into the presentation it would be good to know a little bit of the background so you he would have an idea of what the people are trying to say or do. It's very difficult with this particular staging to just dive right in and understand what is going on.At the beginning of the Trojan War the goddess Diane had turned the wins against Agamemnon. To satisfy the goddess Diane Agamemnon had to sacrifice his daughter Iphig&eacute;nie. However Diane saved Iphig&eacute;nie and delivered her to Tauride, where Iphig&eacute;nie served the enemy Scythians as Diane's high priestess. The first act is 15 years after the incident and takes place during a storm that battered Diane's temple at Tauride.You can look up the details ahead of time and then follow the presentation.

271348,"This has some of the highest production values, some of the best FX sequences, the best musical scoring and some of the best acting to be seen in any Kaiju film. Personally, I rate this as 3rd or 4th all-time best in the Kaiju genre, behind such uber-classics as Godzilla, Invasion of the Astro-Monster, and War of the Gargantuas.Ishiro Honda was the greatest auteur of Kaiju. He was not only the D.W. Griffith of that genre, he was also the Orson Welles. His Kaiju films can be put into 3 rough categories: earnest (i.e. Godzilla, War of the Gargantuas); surreal (Mushroom People); and camp (Invasion of the Astro Monster).This film is mostly in the earnest category, but the sequence with the long tailed mechanical monster hints at Honda's immanent surreal and camp tendencies.Anyhow, this is definitely a very well-made Kaiju, but it is a little slow in some places and the whole strategy of the Mysterians for conquering Earth has some serious flaws. Nonetheless, the idea of alien invaders occupying Japanese territory and and seeking total domination, not to mention the aliens' designs on the local women, is interesting. And surely this storyline must reflect Honda's attitudes toward the American occupation forces which still were maintaining high visibility in Japan in this period.It is my understanding that this film was originally released in Cinemascope or the equivalent, and it really would have been a gas to see it on the big screen that way. The battles between the Earth forces in their strange slow-moving aerial battleships and the Mysterians' ray weapons, in glorious color and with the orchestra playing in full stereo, must have been a kick.Of less interest is the fact that the aliens in this film seem to be the direct inspiration for a dreadful yet popular 1990's children's TV show, the Mighty Morphin Power Rangers.All told, this movie is still a lot more interesting and fun than most of the scifi summer blockbusters nowadays, especially the crap with Will Smith or Tom Cruise.",N/A

334115,"Aladdin (1992) will either knock the socks off viewers, or confoundthem as an incomprehensible cartoon and musical or finally,constitute a piece of art for creators of art, in the sense that somuch is packed into the product, from an artistic point of view andthe manner in which it is done, that it  suggests this release wasnot entirely designed for the mass market or to have a mass appeal.First, the spectacular is definitely here,  starting with thetop-quality animation work (colors, flow, designs, accuracy andstyle of the drawings) which is expected from Disney. The historicparallel story told about ""Alladin"" is woven into this script, withentertainment being the overwhelming concern - a totally correctdecision. Those elements add up such that they satisfy payingconsumers and boost the replay value immensely.From an audio point of view,  the jingle is immediately recognizableas an Aerosmith's number ( ""Rag Doll, livin' in a movie ... so finethey'll never see ya leavin' by the back door""), here rerecordedwith a Louis Armstrong style and instrumentation.Secondly, a not small part of the story is farfetched, with noimaginative boundaries ... this definitely takes this movie into acompletely other dimension, bringing it ever closer to what everyoneknows as dreams. Being incomprehensible is perhaps intentional, inthe sense that this picture is not designed ONLY for youths, butalso for parents and grown ups, both who will find themselveslaughing out loud, chuckling and amazed at the many sequencesthroughout the 90 minutes. Some parts are sincere but hard-hitting,tender and brutal at the same time.Finally, the wide-ranging, not timid and no-limits of the story,much of it resulting from observation immersed in reality, callsforth other emotions - sarcasm,  parody or mockery of certaincultural elements of non-Western countries. Examples is the conceptof pre-arranged marriages, monarchies, strong arm guards, beheadingsfor minor misakes, a camel shown with a tongue hanging out fromoverwork and thirst,  social caste systems, etc.Or in other words, a fair bit seems extreme and not essential to acartoon, so that no doubt a part of the audience may find thempolitically incorrect or controversial and out of step with the 21stcentury.The often heard shouting raises eyebrows, considering that thescript concerns the romance between Aladdin and a princess.Taken together, the script rises above and beyond the mainstream,which is why, perhaps, this movie is an artist's art . designed forthose who are jaded about revisiting again a classic story. e.g. ashowbiz style of speech is used at times to parody certain momentsin the ableIn sum,  this is a  film that nobody could have predicted .. a curveball turned into a home run.",Aladdin VHS  1995

179092,"This film is the test of whether or not you love film noir.  From the beginning, when Fred begins his confession as a wounded man in his office, you know that you are going to witness his descent from a successful if somewhat normal salesman into the realm of loser/criminal/dupe.  The elements are all there:  a quick payoff, a femme fatale, and his nagging feeling that there must be something more to life than his routine of peddling insurance policies to people who live in bigger houses than his measly apartment.  It unwinds at an agonizing pace and is painful to watch, but fascinating and engaging all the same.  For film buffs, there are many similarities in it to Body Heat.THere are many original twists in this, in particular the wonderful character of Edward G. Robinson, an insurance investigator who has a ""gut feeling"" when something is a fraud that will cost the insurance company unjustly.  He worries and paces, unravelling in his head the details of scams instead of having a life of his own.  Fred is his friend and - as the guilty party in his own murder caper - plays a wonderful cat-and-mouse with Edward G. as he turns his attention to the case.  I also loved the way the tension built between Stanwyck and Fred, as he comes to understand that their complicity links them for the rest of their lives.  SLowly, Fred moves from loving her to fearing her to wanting to jettison her in any way he can.  A single misstep and the whole thing cound unravel.  Finally, there is the step daughter, who sows doubt but also is an apparent innocent.  She is the most subtle character in the whole thing, I think.Though I gravitated to scifi as a kid, I watched plenty of this crime stuff.

13791,"After a recent viewing of this movie, I was surprised at the negative reaction to it of some viewers and critics.  It is handsomely produced, with plentiful action, capable performances from the actors, a sprinkling of humor, and a sequence or two that almost reminded me of the Coen Brothers.  It was hardly the greatest film I have seen, but I very much enjoyed the over-the-top way it re-visited a host of archetypal western conventions.  Upon reflection, I think the negative reviews result from a problem I have seen many times before, with many other films.  The whole thing comes down to what you were expecting when you first approached the film.  The recent admirable film, ""Appaloosa"", with Ed Harris and Viggo Mortenson conveys a powerful sense of realism and the feel of a serious western drama.  Films like ""Cat Ballou"" or ""Blazing Saddles"" take the western genre into the realm of outrageous comedy.  ""The Quick and the Dead"" seems to me to deliberately go in neither of these directions.  It might be viewed as a comedy, but I don't think that this was the director's intention, and the actual laugh-producing gags are not found here in abundance.  In some ways, it reminds me of Eastwood's ""High Plains Drifter"", which is another film that does not ask to be taken too seriously; however, this one seems to be more deliberately flashy and extreme.  Right from the opening scene, you are confronted with situations that can clearly not be seen as realism.  One critic stated that he felt that Sharon Stone had not brought the desired amount of psychological depth to her portrayal.  This strikes me as nonsense.  This character, in the context of this movie, is not about psychological depth.  She is deliberately a stone-faced stereotype of a gunslinger, with the somewhat incoherent quality of being too superstar beautiful for the part.  This works like yet another tipoff that the viewer is not to be seeking realism but, instead, a sort of Hollywood send-up reality.  In flashbacks, the Stone character might well be the 19th Century melodrama ""Little Nell"", victim of a dastardly villain, so  cruel and vicious that you have no question as to the violent comeuppance they must inevitably face at the conclusion.  It seems to me that some folks expected an out-and-out comedy, while others expected more realistic, serious action fare.  The problem with this movie is that it is neither.  You can accept this or not.  I very much enjoyed it for what it is.",N/A
1254477,"FLAMMEN & CITRONEN (FLAME AND CITRON) is a dark long film that will prove to enlighten many about another aspect of WW II we know very little.  Written (with Lars Andersen) and directed by Ole Christian Madsen it unfolds a true story about two 'heroes' of the Holger Danske resistance moment, a large group of Danish citizens who fought to kill not only the Nazi invaders but also the Danish supporters of Hitler's movement: the heroes are Flame (Thure Lindhardt) and Citron (Mads Mikkelsen) and the course of their lives is traced with brilliant use of sound, cinematography, a pervading darkness which serves the story well, and attention to minute details that makes the viewer almost involuntarily involved with their mission, their plight and the final results of their work.In addition to the outstanding performances of Lindhardt and Mikkelsen, there are excellent performances by Christian Berkel as Hoffman, leader of the Gestapo, Stine Stengade as the puzzling spy/counterspy/ love interest Ketty Selmer, and a cast of bit players that remain in mind's eye long after the film is over.  Though produced as an epic (and the film is a very very long 130 minutes!) the interaction between the lead characters is clearly defined and they come across as credible resistance fighters whose plight is always one of duress and fear.As in all stories about war that are honest, there is no clear line between right and wrong, between survival and heroism, and it is to Madsen's credit that he keeps us in the shadows with every encounter.  War is war and it alters everyone who is touched by it.  Grady Harp, May 10",Flame And Citron
1138848,"""Vantage Point"" was directed by Pete Travis and written by Barry Levy. The attempted assassination of the President of the United States is told from several different points of view until all the pieces come together. Members of the cast include Dennis Quaid, Forest Whitaker, Matthew Fox, William Hurt, Edgar Ramirez, Zoe Saldana, and Sigourney Weaver.In this ensemble piece, the editing and pacing of the movie was very strong. The car chase scene was one of the better ones I've seen, it was very exciting and engaging. Some of the twists and turns in the plot were very predictable but others were pretty enjoyable. Part of the fun of watching this movie is trying to solve it before they come out and tell you what happened. It almost reminded me of the first few episodes of ""Lost"" where each character's perspective of where they were and what they were doing when the plane crashed ending with something suspenseful. Eventually it all converges on the same city block.On the flip side of that, I think too many perspectives were used. Usually about three is a good number to go with in telling different versions of a story, beyond that it gets a little cluttered and unorganized. At the fourth time, I was like, ""Really? We're going back to 11:59am AGAIN?"" Despite all that, it only has a 90 minute running time because the back story on characters is very brief and given through conversations so it all mostly converges on the assassination attempt and aftermath.Sigourney Weaver and Zoe Saldana are very underutilized in this film. They show up in the beginning to show the newscasters' perspective of the events with Saldana as a reporter trying to throw her own commentary on the event along with the news and Weaver shutting her down as the editor. This leads into Quaid's back story of his Secret Service Agent career with Matthew Fox.Forest Whitaker plays a tourist watching the whole slew of events through his camcorder and he veers between awestruck delight at his surroundings to distressed terror and determination for some reason to run down the bad guys and try to capture all the evidence he can with his camera. Granted, he does capture many relevant moments in footage, but the average tourist of his size risking his life is pretty surprising since he isn't an off-duty Jack Bauer or anything. William Hurt's performance as the President is very brief (like many performances in the film) and he mostly fiddles with paperwork and rides in cars.Matthew Fox's performance was the most predictable with no surprises whatsoever. He plays the same stubborn guy he plays in ""Lost"" but as a Secret Service Agent instead of a surgeon. I would be so relieved if Jack on ""Lost"" somehow got offed in this last season. I could care less who Kate chooses, I think the biggest surprise would be if she chose Claire instead of Jack or Sawyer.All in all, this is an exciting thriller with very short performances and maybe a few too many versions to the story, but edited together very well.",Vantage Point
1297005,"In the early 1990's MTV was at the top of its game. The music videos of the grunge era were always on and MTV had just crossed over into its own original scripted programming. On one hand you had the birth of the very first reality show and you had a strong animation department. MTV was the host of 4 major TV shows and one of them was the cult classic comic book adaptation, The Maxx.The Maxx, like in the comic is not your typical super-hero in fact while he may have powers he may be one of the most human. The Maxx is an individual that has an involuntary ability to shift in and out of dreams and reality. His only friend is a young woman named Julie, who tries to hide from it. The two of them share an unexplainable bond, but there is a strange fellow who knows the link, yet like all `humans' why spoil the fun?I was actually a reader of the comic book and I have to say that it is one of the most original stories ever. It is not about the battle of good and evil. The Maxx is a very human story with an outlandish shell. The feel of the show is like watching an old Ralph Bakshi film, very off color and honky-tonk. It is a story about being strong in a world that unjust and taking a look inside the human mind where we feel invincible. The show is well acted, has some unbelievable visuals and you get a great laugh from time to time. Though the show only lasted one season, it had a solid fan base. The show could not have come out at a more perfect time and it was perfect just the way it was. I think having to extend this show by the season would have really done it damage. Just like the show the comic went soon after. I highly recommend getting this DVD collection. You will never see anything quite as original and unusual again.",N/A

Sadly, the shows don't update that often and I got tired of watching the same 3 episodes over and over for 2 months at a time, not only that, but each posted episode is only 15 minutes long!  My solution was to order this video, which is made up of only the songs, my sons favorite part of the show.We just received this DVD today and have only watched about 1/3 of it, but my son (and I) loved every moment!

And let me tell you, I was so tired after all that dancing I needed a nap myself!

This film just doesn't capture the feel of that show and even though the animation isn't bad, it also isn't all that great. I don't mind remakes when handled with care, but this one seems uninspired and almost pointless. Sure I want to see Astro Boy with all the advances made to animation, but lets do it with an inspired story and people who give a hoot. It's actually a boring movie, which should never be the case when you're talking about an animated film....or any film for that matter! Astro Boy bombs away? Yep!.. It sure does!",Astro Boy

94657,"Batman Forever.  The first Batman movie that was not directed by Tim Burton, and did not feature Michael Keaton in the lead role.  Because of this, the tone of the movie is very different.  It is noticeably less dark than either of the two Burton films.  Batman Returns got a lot of parental backlash because it scared the crud out of many younger kids.  With this movie, Joel Schumacher tried to make a Batman movie that the kids could enjoy, while still appealing to adults.  The result is kind of a go-between between Burton's two previous movies and Batman and Robin.  This movie starts to revert back to the camp of the 60s television show, but they still put in some dark subplots, like Bruce re-living his parent's death, or Robin losing his family and wanting revenge.  Most fans will criticize this as the prelude to Batman and Robin, and the end of that Batman movie series, but I still think this movie has some qualities to it.The plot has a lot of things going on.  Two-Face, played by Tommy Lee Jones, is introduced in the opening scene.  He wants revenge on Batman (it is never really explained why, does he blame Batman for his condition?) and he pursues this vendetta throughout the story.  The Riddler, played by Jim Carrey, is obsessed with mind control.  He invented some kind of box that beams television signals directly into the human brain.  He can then read people's minds, and extract information.  Bruce Wayne initially rejected his idea, and so Riddler harbors a grudge.  Batman, played by the bland, emotionless Val Kilmer, is reliving his parent's death in his dreams.  He is starting to doubt if he wants to continue to be Batman.  He is also starting to date Chase Meridian, played by Nicole Kidman, probably the only actor in this movie who knew what she was doing.  Robin, played by Chris O'Donnell, makes his first appearance onto the big screen.  His parents were killed by Two-Face, and he wants revenge.  Bruce takes him in when he has no place to go, and begins to guide him.  In my opinion the plot had too many subplots.  There just wasn't enough time to develop one individual character.Many of the motivations for these characters are either underexplained, or just plain silly.  For instance, it is never really revealed what Bruce's dream is about.  In the novelization, he remembers as a kid looking in his father's journal and reading that the reason his parents were murdered is because they were taking him to the movies.  He feels guilty about this, and understandably so.  In the actual movie, however, this is never revealed.  Bruce is talking to Nicole Kidman, and he is about to tell her.  Then they start making out.  This entire plot point is never mentioned again.  The Riddler, after having Bruce Wayne reject his idea, turns into a supervillian.  He goes completely insane and decides to kill his boss and steal everyone's mind.  Two-Face, whose back story is only revealed in a brief video clip, is way too silly.  He does his best worst Joker impersonation in my opinion, and is always jumping around laughing and cackling like a lunatic.  Harvey Dent is supposed to be one of the more tragic characters in the Batman universe, but here he's just a joke.  He doesn't really come across as evil.  Along those lines, I didn't care much for Jim Carrey's performance as the Riddler.  He's just playing his roles from The Mask and Ace Venturra all over again.  He, along with Two-Face, is far too silly to be viewed as a villain.  But I suppose it fit with what they were trying to do: make a lighter Batman movie that was mainly aimed at kids.Val Kilmer made an adequate Batman, I guess.  The problem was, he did his Batman growl throughout the entire movie, whether he had his mask on or off.  And he seemed bored with the role, like he was about to fall asleep.  Say what you want about George Clooney's performance, at least he seemed like he was having fun with the role.  One positive thing I have to talk about, which doesn't really reflect Kilmer's performance, is the action scenes.  The action scenes are much better this time around.  I know some of the scenes were cheesy, like the scene with the bank vault near the beginning, or the part where Batman drives the Batmobile up the side of the building.  But I mean the hand-to-hand stuff.  Of the three actors to play Batman in the 90s movie series, Val Kilmer is really the only one who can play an action hero.  In Michael Keaton's movies, the action scenes were not very good.  This was caused primarily by the fact that Michael Keaton is not much of an action hero.  There were other reasons, such as the restrictive batsuit (which was finally changed in this movie) or the fact that Tim Burton cannot direct action scenes very well (this isn't a knock on Burton.  He's a good director, action just isn't his genre).  But wheras Michael Keaton was kind of small and skinny, Val Kilmer was big and muscular, which you kind of need to be to beat up seven or eight guys by yourself.  The fight choreography was pretty good this time around.  People might say that I'm spending too much time focusing on the action scenes, when there is more to the movie than that.  But seriously, Batman is supposed to be one of the best martial artists in the world.  In Burton's movies, I could have beaten that Batman in a fight.  Don't get me wrong, as far as performances go, Kilmer's performance is not equal to Keaton's.  But with all the mistakes this movie made, it's good to know they at least did this one small detail better.The character people usually tend to regard as the low point of the film is Robin.  Because of these movies, many people to this day cannot stand Robin, and regard him as a worthless character.  That is simply not true.  Chris O'Donnel is not playing Dick Grayson, he's playing Jason Todd, the second Robin.  Jason was a whiny cry-baby, who got so intolerably annoying that they killed off his character.  Dick Grayson is not supposed to be this big of an annoyance.  He's supposed to be an interesting character, and kind of a foil for Batman.  Robin was originally created because the writers of the Batman comics were worried that Batman was becoming too dark.  So they created a young character to be youthful and lighthearted and brighten up the story.  That could have worked very well for what they were trying to do with this movie, make a Batman movie that more kids could enjoy.  Robin is supposed to be a very likeable character, and instead we got someone who rivals Anakin Skywalker as the insufferable protagonist.Whining about his dead family, lording it over Bruce after he saved his life, and ordering Bruce to train him to be his partner.  Many people say they hate Robin in general, simply because of these movies.  If that is you, I ask you to reevaluate your opinion of Robin.  He is a pretty interesting character, they just messed him up here.In conclusion, this is a very average film.  It is considered a bad movie, because many people misunderstand it.  It is kind of silly and campy, but they wanted to make it a movie for kids to enjoy.  They really tried to find a balance between being dark and creepy and being silly and cheesy.  In my opinion, they did a pretty good job, for what they were trying to do.  It wasn't like the following movie where they went completely insane and did the most outlandish things they could think of.  The most important question to ask yourself when watching a movie like this is ""was I entertained?""  And yes, I was entertained.  I've even gone back and watched it a few more times over the years.",N/A

1240334,"Cons: I enjoyed the special features on Disc 2, but in three movies, Taylor Lautner is never in the commentary. Every single time I see him do an interview, he's hilarious. I hope SOMEBODY will let (make?) him do commentary in ""Breaking Dawn"" because he hasn't been in the last three, and I wanted to hear what he had to say during the tent scene. The special features also had a lot of random stuff about him throwing a football and catching grapes in his mouth but nothing about the Quileute fictional tribe or those actors. Don't they talk? I've sat in on an interview with Alex Meraz so I know he's funny, but what about the rest of the folks?Pros: I enjoyed this film. This was the very first ""Twilight"" film I saw earlier this year, and I'd never heard of the books or the movies. I just happened to be at a movie theater and nothing else was on. I'd heard Lil' C (from ""Rize"") debating about Team Edward versus Team Jacob on Twitter, and I honestly thought he was talking about krumpers. I should be embarrassed to admit this, but I went on YouTube trying to find the krumpers dance, but it turned out to be this film. The idea of watching a film about werewolves and vampires wasn't something I planned on watching in this lifetime, but again, nothing else was playing. I left that movie theater completely obsessed with all things ""Twilight."" I bought all the books, including the one about Bree, bought all the movies, went to the Twilight Convention in Chicago and interviewed a couple cast members, and people knew I was so hardcore about it that I even got a ""Twilight"" birthday card last month. Before this film, I had no desire to read about stuff like this, but Meyer had a way of making the vampires and werewolves seem more human than fictional.I think all of the cast did a phenomenal job at their roles, although I'm 100% Team Jacob. The tent scene was my favorite scene, and I just use the ""Jump To"" special feature to go directly to all of Taylor Lautner scenes. However, outside of Lautner's work, I enjoyed watching the fight scenes with the wolves. The behind-the-scenes features with real wolves made me want to stick a big wolf painting in the middle of my living room because they are gorgeous. Kudos to the cast. They did a great job!Note: Although I wanted Taylor to be in the commentary with Kristin and Robert, I was entertained to listen to them try to dodge the bed scene, talk about the ""leg hike"" (that was one of my favorites in the book), make Yogi Bear noises with BooBoo Stewart and relieved that Rob realizes how ridiculously sprung Edward is.",N/A

1305851,"The movie KICK ASS lives up to it's title. It's another movie based off a comic book. I wouldn't even call it a super hero movie, because it really wasn't one. It was a action, comedy that mixed in some drama.The story is easy to follow, a unpopular kid named Dave Lizewski(Aaron Johnson). One day he thinks why hasn't anyone tried to be a super hero before. So he decides to become one and Kick Ass is born. The comedy follows, as one early scene he tries to find a cat by show the picture to random people in his costume. Eventually he gets in over his head and runs into Big Daddy(Nicolas Cage) and Hit Girl(Chloe Moretz). Things get more serious, but the movie never leaves what it's best at it's comedy.I won't give more of the story away, so I'll move on to the acting and actors which was great. Though for me two stole the whole movie. First Nicolas Cage was simply great. His best movie since LORD OF WAR. Then there was Chloe Moretz as Hit Girl. This was a dangerous role playing a child who's killing people. I'm sure there's some in the media who will be appalled, but it's just a movie it has no bearing on society or the down fall of it. Chloe did a outstanding job blending he childishness with cold and calculating killer. The best was her chemistry with Cage, you could just tell they enjoyed working together and were having fun.The action and directing by Matthew Vaughn was extremely well done.  The music was also really good.Kick Ass is the best movie of the year for me so far. I highly recommend this movie, I really don't think you'll be disappointed.  I plan on seeing it again.",N/A

1354756,"Part Two of ""Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood"" is what the fans have been waiting for.  This is finally the point where the original ""Fullmetal Alchemist"" parted company with the manga and went off on its own story, but here with ""Brotherhood"" there is the chance to do it right.""Brotherhood"" was a pretty bold experiment.  The firstFullmetal Alchemistanime out-paced the manga, and had to invent new storylines and resolutions separate from Hiromu Arakawa's intentions.  This in not unheard of in Japan.  The same thing happened toNegima!which leads to a drastically different storyline in the manga and the anime.  But with ""Brotherhood"" they decided to go back and re-make the series from the beginning, produced by studio Bones with new directors, character designs and overall look while keeping the story in-line with what was going on in the manga.Part 1of ""Brotherhood"" was good, but a little too rushed.  They were basically covering ground that had already been covered in the first anime, and it isn't until Part Two that the story gets to break free and develop according to plan.  It shows in the quality and attention to character development in Part Two.Part Two contains episodes 14-26, covering volumes 8 through 13 of the manga.  There is too much going on here to give a full synopsis, but there are plenty of surprises in story for the Elrics as they encounter foreigners from a distant country who use alkahestry, an alternate form of the more familiar alchemy used by the brothers, and more secrets of the Philosopher's Stone are revealed.  The highlights of Part 2 are in episode 19, when the power of the homunculi Lust is finally unleashed for an action-packed showdown with Roy Mustang, and the heartbreaking episode 20, where Edward discovers some harsh truths about his transmuting the souls of the dead.I don't know if you have to choose, but I am enjoying ""Brotherhood"" more than the original ""Fullmetal Alchemist"" anime.  The stories are deeper and more complex, and the animation style is more luscious and colorful.If you haven't given ""Brotherhood"" a shot, here is where it really shows itself to be more than a re-do of ""Fullmetal Alchemist.""

504534,"Sudden Fear is a fascinating cross between a woman's film and film noir. Perhaps because of its older female protagonist, it has been unfairly neglected. Joan Crawford, acting less histrionically than usual, plays Myra Hudson an heiress and successful playwright. The fact that  she's rich and talented makes her an obvious target. She falls for and marries sleazy actor Lester Blaine, terrifically played by Jack Palance. Blaine and his mistress, the younger and more attractive Irene (Gloria Grahame) plot to kill her for her fortune. Crawford looks middle-aged and frumpy in this film; she seems to be wearing less make-up and is photographed from less flattering angles. It almost transforms her into a different actress. Its as if we're seeing her true face. For financial reasons, Lester and Irene only have a small window of time to murder her in order to get the money. The latter part of the film is punctuated by ticking clocks. Myra has minutes to pull herself together and save her own life. The ticking clocks also have to do with Myra's aging, dwindling attractiveness and mortality. There are many close-ups of her aging hands and feet that have the effect of magnifying her physical vulnerability. In the film's dramatic denouement, Myra dresses like Irene and the two women's identities merge as they become the object of Blaine's murderous rage. Crawford's training as a silent film actress make the last part of the film extraordinary. A truly great film!",Sudden Fear
606525,"I want to make my review short.There are over 1,000 reviews of this movie so far, so read those for some really in-depth analysis of the plot.  I just want to talk about a few things.I generally like this movie.  It's a good story, spooky, suspenseful, dark, and gloomy.  I think the best thing this movie has going for it is the atmosphere.  There is seemingly a never-ending overcast sky for the entire movie.  I think this creates a consistent spooky atmosphere.  The other thing this movie has going for it is that it's scary and suspenseful most of the time.  Naomi Watts?  She's perfect in her role.  Another thing - the music by Hans Zimmer is highly effective and fits in with what is on the screen.  This music is not overpowering.  Instead, it's very low volume, subtle, and delicate.One thing that just jumped out at me was that this movie borrowed from The Omen (1976 & 2006) and The Changeling (1980).  Watch the movie and you'll see what I mean.  Also, the girl with the hair over her eyes who was thrown into the well looks a lot like Regan from The Exorcist (1973) did when she was possessed.Overall, this is a pretty good flick that I rate at 3 1/2 stars.",N/A

625494,"This film borrows its title from a collection of short stories written by Isaac Asimov (there actually is no individual story or novel called ""I, Robot"").  It also borrows several concepts and terminology from Asimov's ""Robot"" series, particularly the ""Three Laws of Robotics"", the first of which is: ""A robot may not injure a human being or, through inaction, allow a human being to come to harm"".  The movie received a lot of criticism from classic sci-fi fans because it is not really an adaptation of any of Asimov's stories, and because some of the action actually VIOLATES the Laws of Robotics.However, this movie has a deeper connection to classic science fiction than many fans realize.  This movie combines themes from Asimov's ""Robot"" stories with ANOTHER classic science fiction story.  This story is ""With Folded Hands"" by Jack Williamson.  In the Jack Williamson story, a bunch of black robots appear on earth ostensibly to ""help"" human beings but in reality to protect them from any danger at all.  By the end of the story humans are being lobotomized and kept safely in padded rooms where they can't be harmed.By combining these two themes, the movie makers are addressing the central conundrum of Asimov's ""Laws"", namely, how far can you go to protect humans before they're no longer human?  In addition, the movie's ending addresses another theme from Asimov's ""Robot"" stories that is actually much deeper than the ""Laws"": as robots drift towards becoming self-aware sentient beings, how will this affect them and humanity?  What will they (and we) turn into?  On the surface this movie appears to pay minimal service to Asimov's writings, but in reality it is built solidly upon a foundation of classic science fiction ideas.","I, Robot"

Not that I spend much time or effort in doing so, but every time I review something he has a hand in making, I am always wondering what the uproar is about this guy.  He makes mediocre films at best and can't take a lead role in anything really worth watching.  That was until ""Up in the Air"".  This was a damn good movie.  Let me get that out of the way right up front.  George Clooney was fabulous in this picture.  Ryan, his character, was made for George Clooney to beautifully portray.The film focuses on Ryan, whose primary job is firing people.  There appears to be too many people in management lacking the balls to extinguish their employees, so they hire Ryan and his company to fly in and do the job for them.  I happen to agree with the management lacking balls statement personally as well, but what do I know.  So Ryan flies in, cuts the driftwood and flies home.......  Well that is the interesting part.  He doesn't actually fly home, since he is on the road almost every day of every week of every month of every year.  He has no real home to fly to.As with all misguided corporate flailing, Ryan's company hires a fledgling out of college who thinks that she can cut costs by firing people remotely, via web conference.  I love this.  How cathartic is corporate America becoming.  So Natalie brilliantly played by Anna Kendrick, sets out to learn the ropes from Ryan all the while setting up her cost saving death by video scenario.  In addition to tutoring young Natalie in the ways of death dealing, Ryan has found his love interest in the form of Alex, played by Vera Farmiga.  Possibly the one woman in the world as superficial as he is.As with all lonely lost souls the second Ryan opens his heart it is crushed underfoot.  He might have found his only true calling, is a lonely existence, helping pathetic corporate America cut loose its dead weight.  It is a sad story showing how lonely we are as individuals even while we are engulfed by superficial relationships everywhere we turn.  How many people truly know us?  How many people care about who we are as individuals?  Where is the one or two true friends who help make our lives worth living?If you only see a handful of movies each year, you really need to make ""Up in the Air"" one of them.

I am not an expert about film transfers, but I do a lot of amateur photography so I can truly say that there is nothing I would improve with this transfer. Let me say it again--there is NOTHING improve about this transfer. You can disagree with me all you want; I couldn't care less. The contrast and saturation are both perfect--the colors just pop and everything is amazinly bright and crisp. The black levels are normal, ie. they haven't been given a face-lift like on the DVD, but for the amount of whining some people have done you would think it's a bad thing. Guess what? On my 52"" Samsung the blacks look rich and detailed and perfect. Much better than the DVD.I just barely watched this on DVD a little while ago so I was just planning of renting the blu-ray and watching it a bit to check out the transfer. But I could not stop watching, it was so gorgeous. I literally could not tear myself away. I was completely enthralled for two hours. There are not many movies that have that kind of magic. With the HD transfer, I felt like I was watching an entirely new movie and that I was right there in the action. I am not a noob to HD, in fact I have been watching HD movies since 2007. Again, this is an amazing transfer and as long as you aren't watching it on a crappy HDTV with poor black levels, I can promise you your jaw will drop as you watch. And let's be clear, the whole movie isn't filmed at night. There are five, maybe six scenes at night, but they all looked fantastic to my eyes. I just don't get why people are complainging about this transfer. The saytime shots are even more beautiful and there were several scenes (Gen. Monroe's surrender where the two armies march out, the battle in the glen, for example) that had me totally floored with how crisp and rich the colors and details were, particularly on the flags and uniforms.Anyway, I can't say enough about how good this transfer is. Don't believe the whiners on this one. It's completely amazing.P.S. One minor quibble-- I was annoyed that they changed the Clannad song to some weird language version. It didn't feel right at all. Better no song than a butchered one. I think we all just want the original back, are you listening Michael?",N/A

1293118,"During this last generation or so, it has been common for employees to have to travel extensively for their jobs, but usually not to the extent that Ryan Bingham (George Clooney) does in ""Up in the Air.""  Ryan's job is anything but stress-free, either, as he has to fire people for a living in a very tough economy--he is hired to do so by firms that do not want to fire their employees themselves.Ryan leads a solitary life, but in the course of his travels he meets and takes an interest in hottie Alex Goran (Vera Farmiga), a fellow road-warrior, and also meets Natalie Keener (Anna Kendrick), a young employee in his company who suggests changes that, if implemented, would radically change his job duties and lifestyle.In the course of the film, the issue of commitment, and how each of the three deals with it, surfaces.  Ryan states that he doesn't see many stable marriages, but he has no close family ties, no rich friendships, no absorbing and stimulating hobbies, no intellectual pursuits, and no acts of community service--nothing that would make an unmarried life fulfilling and rewarding.  When he is not working, he just rides on airplanes--period.  There is a difference as wide as the Mississippi between him avoiding what he sees as unwise or unhealthy commitments and simply damning existence altogether.  He does start to have feelings for Alex, and the viewer does ultimately see whether his dealings with Alex reinforce or dispel his reluctance to commit.The movie is rated R for adult content, but this is a movie that most children would not be drawn to anyway, as it is for mature audiences.  Even if you are not a big film buff, don't miss this one.  Since the film examines the issues of commitment and economic dislocation, ""Up in the Air"" might be seen decades from now as being emblematic of the late Aughts and early Teens.  It is very much a movie of its time.",N/A

It's actually a gem of a movie with a great cast, a suitably suspenseful plot for a family sci-fi film, a fun version of Godzilla who manages to be a fearsome monster and hero at the same time, and truly great baddie monsters in Kamakurus (giant mantis) and Kumonga (giant spider).One of my favorites.This DVD sadly doesn't include the original English version of this film, instead using an inferior dub from Hong Kong, but since we can watch the movie in the original langauge with subtitles that isn't so bad.",N/A

333738,"It's funny because, while I was watching `Orfeu Negro', I kept thinking to myself; `this seems so French'.  If you know of my absolute adoration of New Wave French Cinema then you'll understand that that statement is meant as a complete compliment.  Finding out that this film was indeed directed by a French filmmaker (Marcel Camus) came as a surprise, but obviously not a big one.  There is an air of jovial intensity that surrounds French film.  It has a carefree quality that entices the audience, but it usually has a tendency to litter the prose with weighty and poignant material.`Orfeu Negro' has that same structure.The film tells a rather abrasive story of a young man (you could label him a ladykiller) named Orfeo, who is engaged to be married despite his displeasure in the idea.  When he happens to meet and fall in love with the luscious Eurydice, his life becomes suddenly complicated.  During `Carnival' (the film takes place in Belize), Orfeo and Eurydice find their spontaneous love affair threatened by the aggressive advances of Orfeo's fianc&eacute;e, Mira and the encroaching Death, seeking to take Eurydice away.The films first half is an unrealistic yet wholly enjoyable thrush of whirlwind romance surrounded by samba music and lavish costumes, but then the films second half delves deeper into the darker context of the film and delivers a shockingly severe (and at times eerily evocative) message about love.It does exist.With ravishing lead performances (Breno Mello is undeniably charming and Marpessa Dawn is enigmatically tantalizing) as well as a slew of supporting performances that more than merely support the leads (Lourdes de Oliveria is tackily vicious, Lea Garcia is splendid as the big-hearted cousin and Waldemar De Souza shines despite being relegated to the background); `Orfeu Negro' really steps up on every front.  It's the direction though that really sets this film apart.  It is so light and airy and just plain fun, yet when the darker elements come into full effect the film becomes undeniably grounded and poignant.  Despite the unrealistic nature of the plot, the film never feels fake.  The spontaneous love that blossoms feels appropriate and remarkably meaningful.I don't think that this film will please everyone, but it is a film that is sure to be cherished by many.",N/A

1203302,"THE PACIFIC, a ten episode HBO series just begun, promises to be much more than many expected.  It is, of course, the true story of the battle for the Pacific theater from December 8, 1941 on and features the Marine Corps battles against the Japanese for this important stage of World War II.  The writers and directors and actors take great pains to show both sides of the conflict: there is the expected use of expletives and pejoratives against the Japanese, but at the same time there is meaningful time spent with the frightened and sorrowful looks in the eyes of the Marines who are killing the Japanese 'like a turkey shoot' - especially in one scene where the lone surviving Japanese soldier (Yoshi Ando) stands against the marines, wounded and crying until out of pity a Marine shoots to kill him, releasing him from the tragedy of war.  It is a purgative moment.The banks of Australia make for good backgrounds as the Marines land on Guadalcanal and the fighting that follows is played with suspense and then horror.  But all along the progress of the film we are introduced to the personalities of these young kids who were fighting for their homeland.  One image that will remain in the viewer's mind throughout this series is the set of maps of the world behind the de-briefing officer: all of Europe on the Atlantic side  of America is colored red with the Nazi swastika symbol while the Pacific side is covered with the advancing red and yellow fag of the Japanese.  America looks very small in the middle and makes us remember why the country felt so attacked during that particular war.  it is a sobering memory.THE PACIFIC  has a cast of mostly unknown actors (except for star Jon Seda) but with the faces of men like Joshua Biton,  Joseph Mazzelo, Toby Leonard Moore, Jon Bernthal, Tom Budge, James Badge Dale, Ashton Homes and Jacob Pitts among many others theses actors will likely join the ranks of those who played n the similar European front in BAND OF BROTHERS.

1307970,"Piranha 3D is a remake of the 1978 original film Piranha which was itself a parody of the classic film Jaws. The film was made by French producer Alexandre Aja best known for his remake of The Hills Have Eyes. You might be asking yourself: now why would Piranhas come out of seemingly nowhere and kill people? The storyline provides the answer: 1) There is a lake under a lake in which Piranhas have survived by eating their own kind in order to survive in this prehistoric lake and when an earthquake hits the Piranhas break loose 2) This is a ""horror"" movie (I'd say it's more of a horror-comedy), it doesn't have to actually make sense in order to enjoy. This is a remake of a movie that was really a parody of Jaws, let's put it that way.I'd say a fun aspect of the film is how it's not that well-written but it makes for a fun B movie. One advantage the movie has is acting, except some characters that were rather goofy the acting in Piranha 3D is pretty good considering how this is a horror movie. The main characters especially were portrayed by good actors in which we actually do see a development to the point that we do care if they survive. The humor of the movie is similar to that of teen aimed movies such as American Pie and Sex Drive, not necessarily a bad thing unless you would consider that sort of humor juvenile. For instance about the humor, watching a penis eaten by piranhas with the 3D effect can only be funny or tasteless, you decide! Now the 3D effect worked very well to a certain degree I'm not sure how well it worked because I have not seen much 3D movies as of yet. Yet there were some pretty good effects and some good thrills resulted out of it. The Piranhas looked amazing and the death scenes (of which there are many) were done in an excellent gory way and looked like an actual death suffered due to Piranhas, it was convincing and not over-exaggerated like you might think it would be. A low point would be the ending as it's a big thrill but ends perhaps too suddenly and surprisingly (maybe a Piranha 3D 3 is in the works? Yes Dimension Films has announced that due to the success earned on the opening weekend by grossing over 10 millions there will be a sequel).Was I disappointed with Piranha? Not really as I knew what to expect (even though some things were unexpected) and knew what kind of movie I was going into. Should you expect high quality from this movie? The answer is no but you should expect to have some fun watching it, especially with friends. Who would I recommend Piranha 3D to? To those who are looking for a fun mindless movie on a boring night, it's entertaining to say the least. One thing is sure if you think the movie misses the target it achieved (whatever it is) it misses in an amusing way. 3 stars out of 5, flawed but fun in the way that you enjoy a good B movie.",N/A

Probably the most recognizable thing about the movie is the Zip A Dee Doo Dah song. If you didn't come across it in this movie first, it is very likely that you came across it in one of Disney's Sing A Long Songs as I have. The song alone helps the movie stand out compared to other movies of the time period.The actual movie itself is great as well. The plot is good and the characters are very believable in portraying the time period of slavery. The movie does a very good job of portraying what it was probably like growing up in Georgia in the slave era. Uncle Remus stands out as probably one of the best characters in the movie. James Baskett was an incredible actor at the time and made me believe that I was watching Uncle Remus tell Brer Rabbit stories instead of someone portraying Uncle Remus.Some critics argue that this movie is racist and even the current CEO of Disney called this movie fairly offensive.

I didn't see the movie in the theater so when I saw the Blu-Ray on sale for $13.I thought it was a great bargain.  Not so much.The story really moves pretty slow, and the action scenes are few but pretty good.The opening scene (2nd actaull scene) at the Stark Expo (think World Fair) is Tony Stark at his narsasitic high or low depending upon how you want to interpret it. But it is just one example of how they slow the movie down and make it drag along, it takes way too much time.  There were definetly NO Acadamy Awards given for editing or scripts in Iron Man 2.The action starts about 35 to 40 minutes into the movie and its too late to resesetate the toxic script. At this point you finally get to see Ivan Vanko bring on the pain in the Monaco Grand Prix, slicing cars in half with his own Russian version of the ARC reactor and the PLASMA whips he uses to slice throug iorn. It is visually stunning for a few minutes but hardly worth the 30 to 45 minute wait.They spend some time setting up the the stroy arc for S.H.I.E.L.D. and H.A.M.M.E.R as combatent government contractors and this means they have to write Nick Furry into the script, which seems kind of forced and clumsy.  The only elegant part of this is the introduction of Black Widow (Scarlett Johansson) who steals the show in the final 20 minutes with the best action scene of the movie. (There is something hypnotizing about watching an attractive redhead rotating through Judiso space while kicking butt. Oh yeah, did I mention she is in skin tight black leather?)The final 20 minutes of this Blu-Ray along with the extra features like the S.H.I.E.L.D. Data Vault and some of the tech details make it worth keeping.Do I think Super Hero movies need to be ""elegant""? Yes, the writers have very little excuse when they have 30 years of storyline and material to draw on. The first Iron Man was far superior to Iron Man 2 and it was a bit clunky at times.The best part of both of the Iron Man movies is Robert Downey Jr. He seems to be custom made or trained to be Tony Stark.

1328491,"Engrossing, suspenseful and a film from Argentina that exemplifies wonderful cinema, ""The Secret in Their Eyes"" is absolutely fantastic!The Academy Award winner of ""Best Foreign Film"" of 2009, the film ""El secreto de sus ojos"" (The Secret in Their Eyes"" is a film that I can't emphasize enough...""must be seen!"".Directed by Juan Jose Campanella (""Son of the Bride"", ""Avelleneda's Moon""), the award winning film is an adaptation of  Eduardo Sacheri's  novel ""La pregunta de sus ojos""  and is Argentina's second biggest office success since the 1975 Leonardo Favio classic ""Nazareno Cruz y el lobo"" (Nazareno Cruz and the Wolf).VIDEO:""The Secret In Their Eyes"" is presented in 1080p High Definition (2:35:1).  The film is shot digitally and there is good emphasis on lighting and also how scenes were captured.  Cinematography by Felix Monti does an excellent job in capturing a variety of scenes, especially in one scene which required a large crowd during a soccer match.The film does display a lot of vibrant red and amber colors (due to the lighting) or characters wearing red but for the most part, the lighting is well-done.  A lot of detail is captured on the walls, texture on the photo books, twill clothing, cigarette smoke flowing through the air to the wrinkles on the skin (love what they did in transforming the characters for 1974 and 1999).  Skin tones are natural and blacks are nice and deep.  I did notice occasional banding but nothing too disruptive.But overall, picture quality is very good.AUDIO & SUBTITLES:""The Secret in Their Eyes"" is presented in Spanish and French 5.1 DTS-HD MA.  Dialogue is crisp and clear and there are times throughout the film where surround channels are being used such as gun shots or a train going through the tracks, crowd ambiance, cell phone ringing, etc.  But for the most part, the film is driven by its dialogue and music.The music by Federico Jusid and Emilio Kauderer is well done, especially during the more emotional scenes and the score is quite powerful.But ""The Secret in Their Eyes"" is not one of those films where you can expect immersive sound.  But for a film that focuses on romance, drama, mystery and suspense, the lossless audio is appropriate for this type of film.Subtitles are presented in English, English SDH and French.SPECIAL FEATURES""The Secret In Their Eyes"" comes with the following special features presented in standard definition, Spanish Stereo and English subtitles:* Commentary with Director Juan Jose Campanella - A very detailed audio commentary as director Juan Jose Campanella breaks down the film and its love story as well as the detective story.

Featuring crew and staff talking about working with each other and* Casting The Secret in Their Eyes - (10:38) Featuring audition footage of various talent for the film.JUDGMENT CALL:When ""The Secret in Their Eyes""  won the Academy Award for ""Best Foreign Language"" film, before I watched the film, I was stunned.  Could there be anything better than Michael Haneke's ""The White Ribbon"", Scandar Copti and Yaron Shani's ""Ajami"" or even the film which I felt was the true contender Jacques Audiard ""Un prophete""?  Granted, I have not watched ""The Secret in Their Eyes"" and having watched the nominated films, these films were outstanding but there must be something about this film by Juan Jose Campanella that stood out.So, I watched this film with the highest of expectations and by the final credits, I realized that ""The Secret in Their Eyes"" is not only deserving for its multiple-award winning accolades but for any fan of cinema, these are the type of films in which the cineaste yearns for, movie making at its best.  And not to downplay the other films which were nominated because I enjoyed those films very much but ""The Secret in Their Eyes"" is one of those films that stays with you and you can't help but feel that this is wonderful cinema, wonderful movie making devoid of banality and ennui.  ""The Secret in Their Eyes"" is wonderful!Juan Jose Campanella did a fantastic job in being the man guiding force of the film.  Many Americans may be aware of his work through TV series such as ""House M.D."" and ""Law & Order: Special Victims Unit"" but before these TV series, he's had success with films such as ""Son of the Bride"" and ""Avellaneda's Moon"".  Campanella is a filmmaker who has a perfect grasp on suspense but also relationships.""The Secret in Their Eyes"" is a two stories in one.  Two people who were attracted to one another 25-years in the past, separated by tragedy and then being reunited once again many years later.  But then we have the mystery, the murder case that has consumed the main character Benjamin, as well as the victim's husband Ricardo.  The corruption within the judicial system and no matter how Benjamin works hard to find the killer of this murder case back in 1974, the system works against him.  But it's that careful pacing, where you feel easy at times and then Campanella's knows when to make the viewer feel uneasy and that something is not right.  And this leads to a chilling discovery by the main character that was not only shocking but a realization that many of us were not prepared for and it works with tremendous efficacy.The performances by Ricardo Darin, Soledad Villamil, Pablo Rago, Guillermo Francella were fantastic.  Every scene was well-done and most of all well-captured by cinematographer Felix Monti.  Not only do you have a well-written story but capable actors to make us believe.  And a wonderful job goes to the makeup department that did a fantastic job in making the talent realistic for 1974 and 1999.  I thought this was well-done.As for the Blu-ray release, picture quality and audio quality were well-done.  PQ has a bit of banding but other than that, it is a solid Sony Pictures Classics release.  If anything prevents near perfection of this Blu-ray release is the special features.  Aside from the wonderful audio commentary by Campanella, the special features were just two short featurettes and I was hoping for more.  Especially on the transforming of the characters for the two time periods.Overall, ""The Secret In Their Eyes"" is a film that is most deserving of its Oscar and multiple awards.  This film is engrossing, suspenseful and truly amazing in every way.Highly recommended!",The Secret in Their Eyes

1315922,"Michael Moore's CAPITALISM: A LOVE STORY begins with a clip from the trailerfor Herschell Gordon Lewis' infamous BLOOD FEAST, which warns the audience ofwhat they are about to see. But, what you will see in this movie will botheryou far more than any campy gorefest could- that is, if you have half a brain,and care at all about what happens to America and its citizens.CAPITALISM shows how Big Business has run roughshod over The Rest Of Us,and has been, for the last thirty-odd years, aided and abetted by our oldpals, The U.S. Government. And, lest you think that only the right wing is inMoore's crosshairs, he makes it clear that Democrats AND Republicans areequally to blame for facilitating The Swindling of America.My favorite moment in the average Moore film is The Big Confrontation, inwhich Moore has cornered someone who is clearly a swine, and knows it, andknows that we all know it, but puts on airs of respectability anyway. I'lladmit to taking a great deal of pleasure in watching such swine squirm. InCAPITALISM, however, you don't really see that. Mr. Moore is so well-knownnowadays that no one with any guilty secrets will deign to talk to him.So, this movie employs more interviews with various people who are close tothe problem- even the Catholic Church puts in its two cents' worth. And, asalways, Moore's use of clips from divers sources in order to illustrate hispoint is masterful and frequently very amusing.This DVD has a whole movie's worth of special features, and they are worthseeing, as they expand upon various persons and situations that are coveredin the main movie. Included is a 1979 TV speech by then-President Carterthat actually could have been made yesterday...it's just that relevant.If you can watch CAPITALISM: A LOVE STORY and not find yourself Mad As HellAnd Not Going To Take It Anymore, you either have a case of Terminal TunnelVision, or you are actually part of the problem. In either case, you oughtto be ashamed. But you're probably not, and that is the true tragedy of it.I consider it an act of patriotism to watch this movie; by all means, do so.",N/A

The story (and Rockq there is a story) lies in the period when the American forces and the people of the Philippines were being kicked by everything the Japs had--which was plenty.  The story tells the story of the PT boats, their crews, and the work of making the top brass see that the little boats had a place as an offensive and defensive weapons--especially in places where larger ships could not go or were not available.  Everything is placed to the side to tell this--and thanks to the motion picture crew, you can see how frail and dealy they were.  As for romance, war is no place for romancing the ladies although, Lord knows, the guys tried.  This is a film to own, and to remember the real men and women who lived these perilous times.Two notes, if you look at the picture in the back, I got a feeling that the picture is one of Dan Daily and the Duke--who were in ""The Wings of Eagles"".

I actually found it to be WAY better than the rather energylessAnother 9 1/2 Weeks.The storyline is in the same vein asBasic Instinct - Director's Cut (Ultimate Edition), only with some twists.  Richard Grieco plays a fellow who accidentally killed a lady during kinky sex games.  Or was it an accident?  Therein lies the question.  Grieco seemed to be an up & coming actor in the early-to-mid 1990s before his career seemed to fizzle out.  Was good to see him again.Angie plays the dude's parole officer {the guy is given parole when a jury determines that the girl's death was an accident}.  Of course, Angie has other reasons for taking his case which cause a professional conflict-of-interest.Of all of Angie's films that are in my collection, this one scores the highest on the skin-o-meter.  While she normally doesn't shy away from shedding her clothes, other movies (like Another 9 & 1/2 Wks) have used bad camera angles during her steamy scenes.  Not so this one!  If you want some great shots of Angie topless, THIS is the flick to get!If you're a fan of Angie Everhart, this DVD belongs in your collection.  Ditto for people who (like me!) think that Hollywood could use more sensual redhead actresses.  I personally think that Angie is the hottest redhead since Tawny Kitean was in her prime.",N/A

Not in an ""MTV Cribs"", lame kind of way, but the authentic people, with down to earth attitudes and and love for music.Yeah, the video footage is dated. What do you expect after 35 years? For it's age, it's incredible and actually shot better than some videos I've seen lately where they zoom and sweep and switch camera shots endlessy in a dizzying manner. The footage was shot tastefully for the most part.The audio is pretty good for the time period as well and the song list is superb. Most every classic is covered here with some oddities thrown in for good measure.If you like the band, you'll like this concert. If you love the band, you'll love this concert.The short stories as told by the band are sometimes funny, sometimes insightful and help to appreciate where this band came from, what they were doing and where they were heading before the tragic accident that took the life of the legendary Ronnie Van Zant, Steve Gaines and Co.The new line-up is pretty great in their own right with Johnny Van Zant having taken over vocal duties for his deceased older brother and Ricky Medlocke filling Allen Collins guitar parts admirably these days.

Someone trips an alarm and the robbers blindfold the bank manager. Claire Ceesey plays this terrified woman, Rebecca Hall.When the men discover that they have escaped the police search, they set Rebecca Hall free.  Then, upon thinking of possible consequences and the fear of returning to prison if caught, Jem Coughlin thinks that Hall just may have seen something and should be killed.Doug MacRay may be the leader of the gang and accepts robbing banks but draws the line at cold blooded murder. He declares that he will watch Hall to see if she makes any contact with the FBI.  In doing this, the characters get to know each other and fall in love.Doug realizes that he has something that he didn't know he needed, someone who loves him and cares what happens to him. He tells the man who organized the bank, Fergie Colum, that he wants to stop robbing banks and move away so he can start a new life. In one of the best scenes in the movie, we witness Fergie's reaction to Doug's request to allow him to leave and stop his criminal activities.With excellent drama and believable characters, we see what happens when MacRay is the only one who wants to stop robbing and we watch the police and FBI in their attempt to find someone who will turn on the gang and give law officials a chance to catch them.A final job is planned. This is to rob Fenway Park after a Boston Red Sox game. There is a confrontation between the robbers, the FBI and Boston Police.I think that movie fans will love this movie as much as I did.

While Funeral Home was a snoozer, I was glad it was the first feature because The House on Sorority Row was worth the wait.This movie is fun and creepy. It tries to be a mystery by not showing the killer throughout the film so you are always guessing. But the identity of the killer is pretty obvious to most horror/mystery buffs but that doesn't take away from the fun.  Most of the kills are fun and unique but there are a couple of, ""she really isn't helping the story so kill her now"" kills.  There's even has a mad doctor that reappears at the end who is fully aware of who the killer is and what's been happening but still tries to keep the ""who and whys"" covered up.There is decent acting by the ""girls"".  Who were all at least 25 years old at the time I'm sure. College graduates... yeah, right. Only if they supposed to be graduate students working on their second master but happen to still live in a sorority house.  There was the big draw of having Eileen Davidson heading the cast as the super bitch sorority sister.

The Standard DVD version is no different than the previous releases except for a 9 minute documentary on ""Musicana"" that was to be the follow-up to Fantasia and a commentary track.But the Blu-ray set has WONDERFUL stuff - I only wish I could watch it! They have released -on DVD for the first time - the wonderful animated collaboration between Disney and Salvatore Dali called ""Destino"". Until recently Park West Auctions (the one on many cruise lines) owned the rights as they were selling framed prints from the film (for BIG dollars). Finally it's out. Not only that but there is a 90-minute documentary too. But this is ONLY ON THE BLU-ray disc. How sad. Imagine how children could learn about modern art by watching this film when they learn about classical music from watching Fantasia. Disney isn't even planning to issue it on a separate mid-priced standard DVD. Shame, shame shame.So if you have a DVD player, go ahead and spring for the set. I've seen Destino before (but only on cruises) and its great. And the documentary - not even available to reviewers in standard DVD format - is probably interesting.

I don't know if Scorsese's insights into our horrendously flawed fleshly existence come to him by accident, or if he is somehow uniquely able to see into the baseness of the human psyche. But, regardless, this is cinema genius at work rivaling Shakespeare's greatest tragedies in starkness, and complexity.With all that said, Departed is yet another great movie.

128485,"Deep Impact and Armageddon release dates were close together, but differently revealing the possibility of impending doom. Although Armageddon was most entertaining and fun, Deep Impact was a slap of reality that dug deep into the personal lives of heroes and victims, not to mention a planet on the verge of total destruction. (We loved the diversity of both movies, so we bought them both.)The graphics effects of both movies were outstanding, but those of Deep Impact, again, were made believable by the interjection of so many lives touched by an impending disaster.The purpose of casting Morgan Freeman as President of the US escapes me, unless the producers wanted us to think that ""this is just a movie, not reality."" If that was their motive, they failed. Freeman made it even more real to us, as he appeared very Presidential. His familiar face made the movie an even more future possibility.The Bible speaks of a future disaster like the one depicted in Deep Impact, created by a meteor named Wormwood. It speaks of one third of mankind dying in the wake of its power. After seeing this movie, and that image joined with my knowledge of Biblical prophesy will be forever etched in my mind, as we all wait for what I believe to be the inevitable.",Deep Impact VHS
404828,"Cynara: Poetry in Motion (Nicole Conn, 1996)I apologize in advance for saying this, because I'm even starting to annoy myself when I do. Every time I review a short film (and I define ""short film"" as anything that clocks in under sixty minutes), I start the review off by saying that I never review short films. I don't do it because if I did, I'd be even father behind in my reviewing than I already am; I probably watch two short films for every feature (and according to my spreadsheet, as I write this, on January 18, 2010, I have watched fourteen features so far this year). But every once in a while, a short film is so good (or so bad) that I can't help myself. And I end up writing that ""I don't normally do this"" opening sentence every damn time. Sorry about that. Still, though, I've reviewed a handful, at most, of shorts in the past five years. I have to be really moved. And the most recent short to do it is Nicole Conn's 1996 film Cynara: Poetry in Motion. This is a film that should by every possible right have been inestimably cheesy. Instead, it's possibly the most erotic, and the most romantic, forty minutes I have ever seen on a screen.The movie takes place in 1883, at Baycliff, a seaside resort in England. Cynara (Johanna Nemeth in her only screen appearance, though she's done some behind-the-scenes work; she was a production designer on Mark Polish's brilliant Northfork) is living there. She's been there for quite a while; the opening monologue is from a letter Cynara wrote to her aunt, expressing her intense boredom. Visually, while this is going on, she's working with clay. It's all very abstract and Merchant-Ivory and blah blah blah, but there's something very yonic (is that a word?) about the clay and the way Cynara's fingers are massaging it. Enter Byron (Growing Up Thirty's Melissa Hellman), the poet, whom the film recasts as female, but masculine; not in the sense of the butch dyke so common in media, but in the sense of lean, muscular, handsome, but still very aware of being a woman. (My apologies if this is as tough to understand while you're reading it as it is for me to try and describe it.) The two are instantly drawn to one another, and the bulk of the film takes place alternately in their fantasies, which are deliciously explicit, and the reality, which is as restrained as you'd expect Victorian society to be; the two of them flirt, and get just to the point where a kiss is about to happen, but propriety stops it from actually happening. My god, it must have been frustrating to live in Victorian times.The end result, however, is stunning. Conn strikes the perfect balance of explicitness and restraint to bring out both the film's softcore tendencies (what a different world film would be if, say, Radley Metzger had a tenth this much talent, or the Dark Brothers one one-hundredth of Conn's sense of the erotic!) and the tender, searing frustration of everything that's not a dream sequence. Are these two ever actually going to get together? As an amusing side note, the running time of the movie stands as a mute excoriation of the attempt to keep sexual tension running through the two main characters of any long-running TV series (The X-Files, anyone?). No wonder the tension between Emily Deschanel and David Boreanaz lasted for about half the first season in Bones. That said, give Conn a big-time network drama with two characters who have a reason for not knocking boots; I have every faith that she could pull it off where so many others have failed.One way or the other, though, get your hands on a copy of Cynara: Poetry in Motion if you have a romantic bone in your body and if you're not turned off by the explicitness. The movie has a shockingly low IMDB rating (3.9 as of January 18, 2010), but only forty-eight votes. That's hardly a representative sampling, one thinks, and I have a strong suspicion that if the film got more press, a lot more people who might actually like the thing might see it. And thus, I'm once again breaking my rule about not reviewing shorts. See this movie. It manages to be both smart and jaw-droppingly sexy at the same time, and the more supposedly erotic movies I see, the more I understand how rare that combination is. ****",Cynara VHS

The television industry is ran by idiots who's bottom line is making the fast profit. I bought this DVD because it seemed rather interesting and lets face it no one tells a better story than the British writer. I like period pieces and the British seem to be experts in the Victorian and Edwardian era. I learned quite a bit from this mini series. I was not aware that women in the upper ranks of society did not take care of their own children.Also the upper crust would leave thier children for over a year with servants. They were more concerned with their sex lives . The servant was given the brunt of the aristocrat's irresponsibility. I thought ""HOW BARBARIC"". No doubt -this program was a pure soap opera with all of its melodrama but it was well written- well acted and it engaged me but there is o need for a continution because where else could one go with a story line like this.

The language of the movie contains Fascist and Nazi phrases which heighten the uneasiness of viewers as we await each new frighening development.

1303409,"Sergio (Sean Combs) is looking for the next big thing to bring in revenue for Pinnacle Records. Aaron Green (Jonah Hill) suggests that they bring Aldous Snow (Russell Brand) to the Greek Theater in Los Angeles for the tenth anniversary of his last live concert there, which was the highest selling live album of all time. As a result Sergio sets up the concert and gives Aaron the task of escorting Aldous from London to Los Angeles in 72 hours. But since Aldous is off the wagon getting him there might be a little harder than Aaron imagined.The character of Aldous Snow was first conjured up by Jason Segel and brought to life by Russell Brand in the 2008 movie Forgetting Sarah Marshall. Not too long after the release of Forgetting Sarah Marshall, director Nick Stoller announced they would be doing a spin off movie based on Aldous Snow falling off the wagon, and that movie would star Russell Brand and Jonah Hill, albeit, in a different role than Hill played Marshall. While the idea seemed intriguing, and the character of Aldous was brilliant in Marshall, I have to admit I had some reservations about the idea of a spinoff focusing on Aldous as a main character. So how did the movie turn out?It turns out I had nothing to worry about. While the premise might sound a bit contrived at first (and the trailers don't help that feeling when you see Combs's character bring it up) the plotting feels nothing less than organic. While at times over the top, it never truly feels over the top, making the world these characters live in feel real. Part of the reason for that is the characters have been perfectly rounded out. One of the things that I was worried about, was in Sarah Marshall Snow wasn't completely fleshed out nor did he need to be, he was a blissed out rock star, and you really didn't need to know more about him for his role in the plot. For Greek writer/director Nick Stoller gives the character a soul, and Russell Brand does a great job of breathing life into that soul.Speaking of Russell Brand, he might have stolen every scene he was in during Forgetting Sarah Marshall, but here he's upstaged, not by Jonah Hill, but (dare I say it) Sean Combs. I never would have expected that I would be saying anything of the sort, but Sean Combs truly steals the movie playing a music executive who's the spiritual brother of Tom Cruise's Les Grossman from Tropic Thunder. Everyone does a great job in their roles, but it's Combs and Brand that really make the movie.Of course not everything comes up roses, the movie suffers from a nearly clich&eacute; third act that stops nearly dead in it's tracks as it gets overly serious. It's understood that in a movie where they show excessive drug use and debauchery things are eventually going to have to come to a head for the characters, at the same time this probably could have been handled in a more entertaining manner. About half way through the third act though things pick up, but it feels like a long way through the third act before they bring back the funny.Overall I highly recommend this movie, and I wouldn't be surprised if when all is said and done at year's end this remains the funniest movie of the year. If you like other movies produced by Judd Apatow (The 40-Year-Old Virgin, Superbad, Pineapple Express, Knocked Up, and most definitely Forgetting Sarah Marshall) you'll most likely, almost definitely love this movie. Come for the brilliant performances of Russell Brand and Sean Combs, stay for the Vegas scene with the Jeffrey, trust me!4/5",N/A

Although this falls short at times and especially at the end, it is so enjoyable watching Estelle and Sly interact as mother and son that the premise is believable.

This movie shows the value of a functional family as well.Sandra Bullock earned her Oscar award in this movie, but in reality it's about Michael Oher (played by Quinton Aaron) -- every scene either contains him or he's part of the discussion.Even though this movie is about sports, it isn't a sports movie. The focus is on the development of Oher. Leigh Anne Touhy may have taken the lead but the rest of the family all took an active role in accepting him.There are several things I like about this movie. First, you've finally got a movie where the main characters are Republican Christians and they're still good people! Second, it recognizes the reality of racism but it also shows that there are many whites who are not racist (including Republican Christians).While this movie is about a family, is it a family movie? I have for years believed that a PG-13 movie disqualifies itself from being a family movie, but this is one that can make me reconsider. In reality, I consider this a PG movie with a few PG-13 scenes as opposed to a true PG-13 movie. As with any movie (even G-rated ones), I encourage parents to watch it with their kids.This movie is a great blend of humor and drama. It has moments of humor, such as Katherine Bates' character describing Tennessee's football field or when Leigh Anne takes Mike shopping.I would highly recommend this movie.

It is an easy read, and you won't regret letting your imagination draw the pictures first.  When you see the movie first, the characters are already formed in your mind when you read the book.",N/A
1337951,"Although the Statlers are not my favorite gospel quartet, I enjoy watching them.  And most importantly, this collection of gospel favorites comes from the Statler Brothers Show which successfully ran on TNN for seven years.  While the show was running, I watched it often, but to my regret, I never really paid attention to the gospel section at the end of the show.  The show incorporated 40 & 50s, country, folk, and of course the gospel songs.What a surprise to hear one of my favorite spirituals, ""I Shall Not Be Moved"".  This upbeat and defiant folk song dates back to the slave era.  Johnny Cash has one of the most popular versions.The Statlers discuss with Bill Gaither, how they came to become with Johnny Cash and sing on his show for several years.  They share their deep friendship within each other.  You will learn the respect the latest member, Jimmy has for the other three Statlers.They share information about what their children and grandchildren's involvement in music.  The name for the group was derived from a box of tissues, called Statler Tissues.Another important friendship and love is the for The Cathedrals and you will see a piece of that,The Cathedrals: A Farewell Celebration.One of the Statlers popular gospel songs is Stuart Hamblin's ""The Ole House"".  A beautiful song that closes the DVD is ""Precious Memories"" when they discuss having good memories.Some great songs include:  Leaning on the Everlasting Arms; Sweet By and Bye; Daddy Sang Bass, The King is Coming; Eye is on the Sparrow; Little is Much, etc. etc.This is a Bill Gaither Tribute to a legendary gospel group, The Statler Brothers.  There is a lot of great classic music.  Rizzo","The Gospel Music of the Statler Brothers, Volume 2"
1328909,"This film is about a dysfunctional family in City Island, the small community which is part of the borough of Bronx. The Rizzo family is full of secrets; Vincent Rizzo is a correctional officer who decides to bring his child from another woman home to his family without revealing to them his true identity. His wife (Julianne Margulies) feels that she is in a loveless marriage and tries to hit on Rizzo's son. His daughter who is home for a break has lost her scholarship at college and is working as a stripper to pay for college expenses. His son has a fetish for overweight women and is using his neighbor to entice another girl from his school on whom he has a secret crush.The movie is a hilarious look at these people, their secrets and the ultimate joy of being a family. The acting, writing and the direction are all solid.The ending is highly predictable but the journey there is fun and entertaining because of outstanding performances. Andy Garcia is the best act in my opinion and superb especially in the scene when he is auditioning for the camera. I liked the movie. 4 stars. 11/24/10",N/A

1149076,"The first two seasons Dexter had a very strict code on how on he did things. He basically was a lone wolf without any attachments to anybody. This season all of his rules go out the window, he is basically influenced by everybody around him doing stuff that he would never do before. They modified his character too much to fit the story. They also made some of the other characters (Rita and Vince Masuka to name a couple) change too drastically to so they can fit the story line.I love this show because all of the characters are so well defined but this season they toss the rules out of the window. I'm not too impressed by Jimmy Smits acting either especially when his accent comes and goes and his overacting gets annoying after awhile.As you can tell I didn't like Season 3 that well but I still can't wait to see Season 4 though hopefully it will be better.Update: I did just see Dexter 4 and it was way better than season 3.

1305212,"""Inception"" is brilliant! This is how the story goes: Dom Cobb is a skilled thief, the absolute best in the dangerous art of extraction, stealing valuable secrets from deep within the subconscious during the dream state when the mind is at its most vulnerable. Cobb's rare ability has made him a coveted player in this treacherous new world of corporate espionage, but it has also made him an international fugitive and cost him everything he has ever loved. Now Cobb is being offered a chance at redemption. One last job could give him his life back but only if he can accomplish the impossible -- inception. Instead of the perfect heist, Cobb and his team of specialists have to pull off the reverse: their task is not to steal an idea but to plant one. If they succeed, it could be the perfect crime. But no amount of careful planning or expertise can prepare the team for the dangerous enemy that seems to predict their every move.

102274,"I was about to give 5 stars to this movie and to say it's the best thriller I've ever seen, but... after reading a few reviews by other people here at Amazon I changed my mind somewhat. First off, I still like the movie very much. But I have to admit that the plot is standard and predictable, there's nothing special about the story of a corrupt politician, hired killers, mafia connections and a good cop who wins in the end against all odds.The script is average at best, the cast is good but nothing spectacular, except McQueen, who doesn't really perform much, one has to admit. Yes, he looks great for this role, but the role does not require much more than good looks.So what's so great about this film? I think Peter Yates directed everything in this movie, even average things, with such a lot of taste, to the absolute perfection. Especially camerawork, late Technicolor age  obsession with color, perfect eye for the detail, street scene, so much mid-60's spirit in everything on screen - this makes even secondary frames, which might not make sense in a different movie, absolutely necessary in ""Bullitt"".Scenes in the bar, in the airport (I'm not mentioning the car chase quite intentionally) are so natural and un-natural at the same time with this Technicolor overdose that images from this movie would be with me forever. Strangely, it brought to my mind ""The Blast of Silence"", the 1961 B&W; noir by Allen Baron. Surely  McQueen is much more modern than Baron (who directed the film and played Frank Bono, the main character), but there's something about the two movies which brings them together for me, maybe zeitgeist captured with such a great skill and attention to detail.So - five stars to Bullitt after all. And yes, I saw The Getaway. To my taste Bullitt is beyond comparison.The Getaway is just entertainment. Two Lane Blacktop must be mentioned too when talking about Bullitt, surely.",N/A
16821,"This retro review is for the special edition release of the 1993 film,""In the Line of Fire"".This well directed suspense/thriller by Wolfgang Peterson shows a well cast movie and all with ""game on"".The story involves one Secret Service agent Frank Horrigan(Eastwood)who is a ""living legend"",in his own tongue-in-cheek words.He is the only active and still working agent who ever lost a president on his watch(JFK);which has haunted him for years and continues to dog him with his peers.Enter one killer/psycho by the name of Mitch Leary who is hell bent on killing the president.He starngely knows Horrigan's background and throughout the movie plays a cat and mouse game with him and the rest of the secret service.Horrigan and his staff always seem to be a step behind the killer and as close as they sometimes come,they can never quite put their hands on him.Leary slowly and methodically weaves his plan,letting no one get in the way and leaving no loose ends.For example,when he opens a phony bank account and the rep catches him in a lie about his background,he follows her home and coldly kills her because he might be able to i.d. him,and her roommate because she was just in the wrong place at the wrong time.When Horrigan does finally obtain a lead in the form of fingerprints he is stone walled by none other than the CIA.Eventually it comes out to a much chagrined Horrigan,that Leary was an ex-CIA assasin who has now gone rogue.With this information the impetus to catch him steps up a few notches.All realize that Leary is VERY capable of doing exactly what he plans to do.It is during the president's campaigning in California that the noose tightens and the Secret Service finally get their man.Horrigan saves the president's life by taking the assasin's bullet.Trying to escape Leary uses Horrigan as a shield and they ride an elevator several floors where the big showdown occurs.The movie ends with Horrigan and love interest,fellow agent Lilly Raines(Rene Russo),sitting on the steps of the Lincoln memorial contemplating their future.This movie got Malkovich an OSCAR and Golden Globe nomination,so memorable was his performance.He played the psycho to a tee;on the one hand very methodical and serious minded and on the other given to violent fits of rage.All this wrapped up in a character with no conscience who could kill in cold blood in an instant.Eastwood gives one his best performances on screen.For all his critics who claim he is wooden and lacking range,I invite them to see this.Eastwood embues his character with a very natural and appealing quality,but one who has been haunted deeply by his past.He pulls it off brilliantly and effortlessly.Technically the movie in this transfer is very good.The picture is quite clear and crisp in it's widescreen format and the sound is great in Dolby 5.1 or 2.0.There is a myriad of special features which include the trailer,talent files on the films director and three main stars,shorts on ""Catching the Counterfeiters"",""How'd they do That?"",""The Ultimate Sacrifce:In the line of Fire"", and an inside look at the real Secret Service.There is also a directors commentary and deleted scenes.All in all a fine release of a fine and well done film.Eastwood the films hero and Malkovich his nemesis,play their parts with equal panache and a naturalness that makes for a more believable and enjoyable movie going experience throughout;excellent performances by both.The movie clocks in at around 127 minutes but it doesn't feel that long;one of my time worn but sure fire ways of telling me that I'm watching something better than run of the mill.This movie is a winner all the way.",N/A

583471,"Although I had, of course, heard of this film, I never saw it untill I purchased this DVD.  It seems that everyone raves about this movie, calling it a classic and one of the best sci-fi films ever made.  To me it was kind of dissapointing.  I was expecting it to be great, like everyone says it is, but in reality, it really wasn't all that terrific.  The plot, of course, as everyone knows, concerns a team of military personnel that unearths a spaceship encased in ice that contains an alien.  After discovering that the alien is dangerous, they have to find a way to destroy it.  One of the characters, a scientist named ""Dr. Carrington"", was so annoying that I kept wanting to jump through the TV screen and strangle him!  He kept screwing things up for the crew with his ""know-it-all"" attitude.  Also, it was frequently difficult to understand what the actors were saying, owing to the fact that they frequently talked over one another!! (good thing this DVD came with subtitles).  The captain in the movie must have said the words ""Holy cats!"" about five-thousand times. (really silly!)  The picture itself is fairly clear, with not too many nicks and scratches. The only special feature on the disc is the trailer.  All in all, a rather disssapointing movie.  I can't understand what all the fuss is about concerning this film.

1247850,Iron Man 2 DVDThis was a very good sequel to the first ever Iron Man and in many ways I felt it was better but there is one thing that really bugged me about this movie. It is common in all super hero movies that the good guy usually wins almost all of the time. I am not saying that Iron Man had to lose here but it would have been nice for Mickey Rocrick to have his character to continue and kill off the other character the black guy who was helping fight Mickey at the end of the movie. Another part that would have been cool to me is if the guards would have been able to stop the girl from breaking in. I understand the point was for her to be unstoppable in martial arts but are we serious that she took out almost all those guards at once except for the one in the front which the car driver drove. I feel besides those things this movie just flowed. There really was not one point where I wanted to turn this movie off. Couple of the scenes that really standout to me are at the race car event when we are first introduced to someone that can fight Iron Man without help. Mickey played that role perfect and the twist that got him out of jail was a nice touch as well. Also a comedy and serious part of the movie came when Iron Man was having his birthday party some funny parts there but it is also where the movie started to take a different turn. Overall I can't complain. The Iron man series has been surprisingly very good and they have left room open to make a third if they wish. Great job here and I am going to go with 4 out of 5 stars and a strong recommendation to get this movie.,N/A

941907,"I watched the 2007 adaptation ofFanny Hilla couple of days ago, and though it had some issues in terms of plot, the movie itself was beautifully filmed. In this older version starring Lisa Raines in the title role, I actually enjoyed the dialogue (which is witty and funny), and the over-the-top bedroom antics, but felt the entire production was let down by the poor picture quality. The DVD I watched had extremely poor picture quality - the picture lacked sharpness and clarity, and appeared like it was lifted straight off a VHS with no attempt being made to digitally remaster it. Very disappointing, considering the story itself was entertaining and well-written, not to mention credibly acted to superior comic effect.Having never watched the original release on VHS, I have no idea how much has been edited from this version, though I did sense some choppiness in the plot - perhaps due to bits being cut out of this release. I can't imagine why - certainly, it can't be due to censorship concerns, considering the abundant nudity throughout this movie - bare breasts compete with bare bottoms and much more! Oh well, at least it afforded me an opportunity to watch this older version and compare it to the 2007 adaptation. On the whole, I'd suggest this as a rental until a far superior version is released.",Fanny Hill
1375989,"First, let me say...if you watch television and are used to three minute snippets of script, or you are a passive viewer who needs to be spoon fed every single nuance that is in a film...then this is not the film for you.  If, however, you like to dwell in what the characters are saying with their eyes, feel the energy passing between the two characters and get wrapped up in the subtext of thoughts which the actors protray...then see/buy this film.Truly it is cinema in the European sense of the word.  Texture, depth and a spirit of humanity are elements that the director brings to play as the characters each find out who they are and what motivates them.  Coupled with a modern, nonchalant acceptance/ambivalence towards gay lifestyle in the film, the characters ultimately find themselves and realize their destinies.It is about time that a gay themed film finally has characters who don't hate themselves or act like ninny's. Also, it is refreshing to see a film where there is a happy ending with no one killing themselves or walking off into the sunset stoically.  More so the pity that our American directors can't bring to the screen anything close to what their European and South American counterparts have been presenting lately.

It's got just that perfect balance of comedy, drama, action and even a bit of romance that makes a movie great. The actors are all very good in their respective roles, including some great performances by Sheen, Berenger and a young Snipes. Special mention for Bob Ucker as well for his hilarious take on being the Indians announcer.This Blu-ray edition is a good transfer as well. The picture is crisp and shows no visual artifacts or defects at 1080p viewing. One thing that I really enjoyed on this disc was the alt. ending scenes and what the original storyline was for the owner of the Indians and how they envisioned her arc in to end up completely differently. For those who haven't seen it, the movie would have been the same up almost till the end where they revealed that she really did love the Indians, there in Cleveland and it was her plan all along to get those personal (whom she could afford) and that manager and get them to pull it together for a playoff run.While I don't necessarily think they should have gone with the alt. ending, I think that could have been equally as satisfying as what we got.

90609,"Blade Runner:Final Cut has seen Ridley Scott ditch the voice-over narrative by Ford and up-beat happy ending and added a dream sequence of Deckard's of a unicorn,thus proving he's a replicant too.The film adapted from Philip K Dick's, Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep? is a cult classic.In Dick's work on which this film is based, is an obsession with the blurring of reality, dreams and waking confused together, mechanical replicas indistinguishable from their originals,what is humanity?This hard-boiled SF noir set in a dystopian future with an impoverished nature and looming towers,balls of flame in the skies.The drifting ex-cop Deckard(Ford) is pulled back into the loop of bounty-hunting replicants,who have illegally returned from outer planets,where they are slaves,to find the secret to a longer life on earth.Dramatic action has replaced overt philosophising to good effect.Four androids are at large and Deckard must hunt them down.The ways they are tested is by answering a series of questions,the answers to which show whether they have humanity.Although they failed the test,their behaviour is empathetic.Deckard finds enough life and humanity in these entities to stimulate his own sense of empathy.Deckard discovers not unfeeling robots he supposed them to be,but creatures in search of warmth,affection and personal ties he and his fellow natural beings are losing. Boundaries blur from sociopathy to empathy,and humans increasingly lose their souls in dealing out death and destruction or in materialistic pursuits.The dehumanising effects of technology on human life are latent.Androids become more `life-like' over time,humans more robotic to meet society's needs.Androids' intelligence surpasses humans,what about their rights?Are androids entitled to share our life,are we grateful for our life?Can't androids dream of electric sheep?The Tyrell Corporation can do nothing to help,it has even programmed `memories' of childhood years,which is shown to deceive Rachel(Young)into thinking she is human.When Deckard forms an attachment to her (she also saves his life),he is forced to rethink what it is to be human and to be mortal.Although Deckard loves Rachel he is intent, while saving her, to kill all the other replicants.The human story,though somewhat subdued and thin,is overshadowed by the extraordinary sets and special effects,which are amazing.Are humans without emotions more valuable than machines with?Rutger Hauer's Roy gives a soliloquy prior to his own death (and after saving Deckard's life),about a replicant's dilemma:""I've seen things you people wouldn't believe. Attack ships on fire off the shoulder of Orion. I watched C-beams glitter in the dark near the Tannhauser gate. All those moments will be lost in time, like tears in rain.""This is a thoroughly moving speech by a time-fixed replicant aware of mortality who has transfixed Deckard with his emotions and desire to have him as witness.The rain-soaked ,decaying Los Angeles of 2019 is vividly realized. The film addresses the psychological aspects of the future,not the CGI effects,not the action,but the everyday lives of ordinary people under horrendous conditions.The slower rhythmns and pace of things brings this out.I believe the Final Cut is the best version, the one intended by the director and should be the one we settle down with,as it bypasses the studio's sabotage through fear of what the director intended.Ignore the 'directors' version.He had no hand in it.",Blade Runner
98448,"""Dirty Harry"" has to be taken in the context of the time it was released.  Recent High Court decisions hampered the authority of the constabulary.  There was civil unrest and there was a feeling among some of the populace that the criminal element of society was being coddled by the courts.  All you have to do is look at my own hometown, Philadephia, where a cop, Frank Rizzo, was elected mayor and went by the monicker ""Billy the Kid"".  This film serves to vent the frustrations of the law abiding who feel they are at the mercy of the hoodlums.  Harry Callahan (Clint Eastwood) isn't so much a vigilante but a cop, disgruntled with the system, who when occasion calls bends the rules to restore law and order.  His adversary here is an amoral serial killer, Scorpio (Andrew Robinson), who cleverly plays the system to walk away from his heinous crimes.  It's of little irony that Scorpio sports a belt buckle with a distorted peace sign.  Director Don Siegel films the action in a gritty style and the story is a non-stop adrenaline rush.  I first saw ""Dirty Harry"" about 25 years ago and it left more of an impression then.  This is not to say the film is dated but I think it's that our men in blue have been restored to hero status and that we now have a more common sense approach to prosecuting the criminal element.",N/A

And  like was said before the actor paul stewart made a slimy good villian in this movie and the actor john hoyt was a good villian too.playing the mobster who tries to look like a respectable businessman. he even has  a sexy ditsy,dancing  girlfriend in his rich penthouse apartment, this blonde bombshell is  really far toooo young for him but it works in a picture like this. I would of loved to see one more big gorilla like henchmen in this movie like a mike mazurki type from the movie ""murder my sweet"" with dick powell but it was fine as it was.raft has a good looking gal too but as was mentioned he was a bit too old for her and a bit too old for this role.I think a  younger  more muscular Robert mitchum may of been a better choice for this movie. even though I am glad raft got the part.So If you like tough guy, film noir movies like I certainly do.... loan shark and arson inc wont dissapoint you .

I believe you lost the intended effect of those scenes upon the studio doing that on the previous version of the film's release on DVD.I have the Laser Video Disc version which is the same at this ""new, remastered"" version, which is presented as it was in theaters.I am very pleased with this version and they spent a little time cleaning up the print too.I highly recommend this version for those who want the film as it was originally presented.",N/A
1348589,"Well, seeing as how most of my friends are nerdy we all went out to see Scott Pilgrim vs. the World. The initial premise (as mentioned repeatedly in the trailers) is that Scott falls for a girl (Ramona) who has had an unhappy string of relationships with a bunch of nutcases and Scott has to defeat all of them. Just going off of the trailer, I was expecting a pretty straightforwards romp with hyperactive graphics everywhere. What I got was something much better.First of all the story is not as simple as first impression would indicate. Scott is also quite the heartbreaker in the film and his experience mirrors Ramona's a lot. I would even go so far to say that he doesn't so much as defeat the evil exes as much as come to terms with how he broke up with various girls and how his previous ugly break up with Envy has really slammed him. At least, that's what I got with the ""fight"" with the Evil Twin Scott. All the other characters are just as screwed up and just as awkwardly nerdy in their own way. Anyway there is a rather cute little story about respecting yourself and other people underneath all of the flash and bang.The flash and bang isn't all that bad either. This features probably the most fun I've seen with ""Bam!"" ""Pow!"" and ""Thud!"" since I was ten and was still watching Batman with Adam West. It's rather like watching a live action comic, because the sound inserts are used where one would expect to find them in a comic, including the ringing phones and headdesking. Each of the fights with the evil exes are different and entertaining in completely different ways. I loved the bass battle between Scott and ex number 3, if only because I was the only one in the theater who realized what they were playing (Final Fantasy fight music) and thoroughly amused by it.In general, I would call the visuals and the narrative style distinctly and awesomely campy. It makes utterly no pretense of being anything else and gives it a giant bear hug topped off with a big sloppy kiss instead. Anyone who has ever played and liked a video game of any kind will probably find some in-joke to chuckle at. The acting and camera work is completely tongue in cheek and it pulls it together.I wouldn't look at this film as the next Oscar winner, but the story is better than I thought, the visuals serve the narrative, the soundtrack rocks the house and the jokes are funny. There's not much more I could ask for out of this film. I loved it, thought it awesome and will probably see it again given the opportunity.",N/A

1357340,"Last year I saw ""Paranormal Activity"" on my birthday so I was all excited to do the same thing again this year. I saw ""Paranormal Activity 2"" yesterday again on my birthday, but I certainly am glad that I only paid college movie theater prices ($5). I'd have been really annoyed if I paid beaucoup bucks to see the sequel. ""Paranormal Activity"" was creepy and exciting and weird. This movie included the lady in the last movie with her sister, and it talked about the connection between the siblings and what was going on outside of her home. The difference with the sequel is that there was a baby, a German Shepherd, a married couple, a teenage girl, a babysitter/maid and the teenage girl's boyfriend involved.My initial thought was, ""The first movie was so creepy because they had to depend on each other and there was no one to turn to."" This movie seemed to have too many people, but when the babysitter/maid was kicked out and the boyfriend wasn't constantly around, I thought, ""Okay, well, they're slowly filtering people out."" The keyword here is ""slowly."" This movie was entirely too slow. I could've sworn I saw night #19 two times, but why on Earth did it take so long to get to the action? I'm almost positive it was a good 40 minutes into the movie before viewers saw anything remotely scary or even exciting. I got so tired of looking at that dumb pool and the countertop. Enough! I wanted to be scared, and this movie was not fulfilling my paranoia request.Another problem I had--that any dog owner should, especially a German Shepherd owner of which I've lived with two--was that the dog was so relaxed when noises were heard. The teenage girl and the wife would go running downstairs anytime they heard anything, but the dog would stay in place. It wasn't like they told the dog to ""Stay."" The dog just wasn't around. She was in the baby's room just sleeping like she had a sedative. Dogs don't operate like this. If I stand up to go wash my hands, both dogs I've lived with are almost knocking me in the hip to get to the sink first. Even the most well-trained dog, especially German Shepherds who are naturally inquisitive and incredibly protective, will hear the noises LONG before a human would and will investigate. By the time the dog started acting like a dog I was bored with its whole existence.This movie just didn't cut it. There are some films that don't need to be made into sequels, and this was one of them.",N/A
81420,"After watching Good Will Hunting, I was struck by two similarities to other works of fiction (in this case, novels) that I had previously read: J.D. Salinger's ""Catcher in the Rye"", and Stephen King's ""Rage"".  Unfortunately, I did not enjoy either of those efforts, and didn't take to ""Hunting"" any more pleasantly.For a basic plot summary, this film centers on young Will Hunting (Matt Damon), a mathematical genius (of savant proportions) who spends his time mopping floors at a local university before solving a complex equation left on a blackboard and catching the eye of a math professor (Stellan Skarsgrd).  However, Will is a troubled young man who lacks motivation, along with a history of violence, and thus is sent to therapist Sean Maguire (Robin Williams), who tries a rather unorthodox approach to salvaging the boy's unique talents.Although I can see why some people would like this film much more than I (due to the deep psychological themes), I have never been one much for the ""bratty youngster needs a character treatise to understand what he is going through"" type of storytelling.  To me, Will Hunting was an arrogant, unmotivated jerk in the beginning of the film, then a whole bunch of psychological terms/scenarios were thrown around, and now suddenly I'm supposed to believe that everything is okay?  Not quite.To me, the most interesting scenes in this film revolved around Hunting's potential girlfriend (played by Minnie Driver).  I actually felt that her relationship with Will (and her character altogether) were the high points of the film, not the ""tense"" client-therapist scenes that were supposed to steal the show.I realize that I am probably in the minority here, but I really can't recommend this film to anyone besides those who love to be wowed by psychological scenarios/situations.  I found it be pretentious and bloated to be otherwise.",Good Will Hunting
1295148,"I, too, am angry that once again the desire for profits leaves the consumer uninformed,ignored and basically cheated!My AVATAR journey:  first saw it in IMAX 3D at Universal City Walk in So. Cal.  Yes, it was overwhelming, brilliantly composed, basic characters and script far overshadowed by the brilliance of the technical genius.  A bit overpowering, however, in IMAX and not as comfortable as I had hoped.Second time was a screening at Fox Studios in West L.A.  Actually the presentation was much better in the normal wide screen 3D.  And seeing it at its home studio didn't hurt at all.Third through now......a screener sent to the AMPAS voters, watched at a friend's on a 50"" screen, surround sound fully enhanced....for some reason it WAS almost in 3D, no glasses needed.  For me, I have found that there are certain glasses that have been used for some music videos and travelogues which dim the input to the right eye and when the camera pans or moves, the sense of depth and 3D of the characters is created.  I have a pair that were given away years ago when the Rose Parade was presented in this kind of 3D, not the colorized double image that cuts out real color and is very blurry and ghosty (JOURNEY TO THE CENTER OF THE EARTH with Brendon Frasier, for example).  I have watched many BIG films wearing these glasses and the 3D is more ""depth"" than ""in your face"" but certainly a big change.I may not have the money to buy a 3D wide screen in the near future, but I am DEFINITELY waiting for the later release of the film, with the expected additions and discussions and making of docs, etc.If you want the film that much, see the re-release.....and wait for the end of the year.",N/A
1117002,"PERSEPOLIS is an animated adaptation by Marjane Satrapi and Vincent Paronnaud of Satrapi's critically acclaimed graphic novels which recount her upbringing in revolutionary-era Iran and difficult adaptation to Europe. The film combines both a historical presentation of Iran's tribulations with poignant observations of the immigrant experience.PERSEPOLIS has a few twists and turns like every Bildungsroman, but its course is fairly simple. As the film opens, we see the last days of the Shah's regime and the hope for a new, free country. The release of political prisoners bring Marjane's communist uncle Mantoush home, who tries to instill a desire for justice in his niece. After Khomeini turns the country into a theocratic regime and Iran is mired in a long, pointless war with Iraq, Marjane is sent to a boarding school in Vienna. Here she becomes ashamed of her background, has a constant series of feuds with landlords, and eventually ends up homeless. After she collapses in the cold and is taken to hospital, she decides to return to Iran. But now she finds that instead of the homeland she missed, the country had become even more hardline and corrupt. At the end of the film, Marjane arrives in France, determined to make it in Europe while staying true to herself.Though the tribulations of Satrapi's life were great, PERSEPOLIS is able to depict many things with humour. From Tehran's shady trenchcoat-clad sellers of forbidden music casettes to Marjane's ecstasy in a well-stocked European supermarket, there are a lot of laughs in the film. It sometimes feels a lightweight venture -- the presentation of Iran's history tends toward the didactic, while Marjane's experiences in Austria are never given as much depth as they might have been. Still, it's entertaining and often touching, and I'd recommend it.I saw this film in the original French, so I cannot comment on the voice acting in the English-language version.",Persepolis
740783,"Hellboy: 10 out of 10: Hellboy is one of the three best comic book adaptations of the last ten years. Now considering the recent spate of mediocre comic book adaptations (as of 2004) this is a bit like winning a beauty contest at a fat farm. Hellboy is simply head and shoulders above the rest.It is on par with the recent Spiderman movies (Hellboy sports a better hero and better CGI effects while Spiderman takes the nod in the love interest and villains categories) much better than the X-men films and simply puts other comic book adaptations to shame (League of Extraordinary Gentleman should be particularly embarrassed)Hellboy starts with a rip-off of one of the last scenes in Raiders of the Lost Ark and introduces horrible clich&eacute;d villains such as Nazi babe and Rasputin. Yet the scene works somehow. Director Guillermo del Toro nails a comic book style to the direction that keeps the action and humor going during the most implausible circumstances. Kudos is also in order for the special effects, both make-up (which is spot on) and CGI.In general I dislike CGI effects compared to models but they really do shine here. Many a big-budget Hollywood film has come out recently with horrible special effects that stick out despite 50 million plus budgets. Hellboy's effects are simply seamless where one forgets that entire characters and locations are digitally generated.The acting is also seamless with lead Ron Perlman giving a scene stealing cigar chomping performance that rivals Daniel Day Lewis's turn in Gangs of New York and Jeffrey Tambor turning a stock clich&eacute; (obstructionist bureaucrat who wants to shut everything down) into a humanistic sympathetic character. (This is an example of very smart writing which permeates the film that makes even the clich&eacute;d characters into three-dimensional figures.)Although all is not perfect (In addition to Nazi Chick and Rasputin we also have a Clock/Sand Nazi and a Space Cthulhu as an improbable villains); Hellboy is better than an action movie should be, much better than a comic book adaptation ought to be, and immeasurable better than a movie called Hellboy deserves to be.",N/A

30643,"I remember when I was going to college in the 1960s and being a great Wayne fan, I would hear from a lot of boobs about what a terrible actor the Duke was. (This was before the Oscar for ""True Grit"" and Wayne's final great performance in ""The Shootist."")  Well the individuals who spoke negatively of the Duke obviously never saw ""The Searchers,"" ""Red River,"" ""Sands of Iwo Jima"" or this film.  They were wrong about a lot of things, not the least of which was what a fine actor the Duke was, (on top of being the greatest movie star of all-time.)This film features one of his greatest performances as Captain Nathan Brittles, a veteran cavalry officer just a few days short of retirement.  Obviously, being a John Ford western, an indian uprising is going to start before the Captain can permanently take his uniform off.  Wearing make-up to make him appear much older than his actual age, Wayne has some wonderfully sensitive scenes, especially the ones of him talking to his late wife while sitting at her grave each night.This is the only one of Ford's cavalry trilogy to be filmed in color and, other than ""The Searchers,"" it is probably his most beautiful film.  Filmed in Monument Valley, with the red soil kicking up red dust as the horses trample through and the beautiful blue skies, this must have looked stunnning on the big screen.The supporting cast is great with John Agar and Joanne Dru (very attractive) doing a nice job as the constantly bickering young lovers, a young Ben Johnson as a former confederate soldier turned U.S. cavalry sergeant, and Victor MacLaglen hilarious as the stereotypical drunken Irish cavalry sergeant.  The rest of the cast is terrific as well.The extras include some color home-movies of Wayne and Ford scouting locations for this film, a re-release trailer and some information regarding the films Wayne and Ford did together.This and ""Sands of Iwo Jima"" came out the same year.  Wayne was nominated for the oscar for best actor for ""Sands of Iwo Jima.""  I once read an interview with him where he mistakenly thought he was nominated for ""She Wore A Yellow Ribbon"" instead.

400762,"1943's THE DESPERADOES opens with a bang, as the Clanton Bank in Red Valley, Utah gets robbed by several bandits with dynamite. They're angered to find nothing in the safe, and we soon find out why - banker Stanley Clanton (Porter Hall) himself, in cahoots with the town's postmaster and stable boss Uncle Willie McLeod (Edgar Buchanan) have taken the money themselves - though they also planned the robbery as a diversion. They pay off the robbers led by Jack Lester (Bernard Nedell), but there's been a hitch, as three townspeople were killed in the robbery - which was supposed to be bloodless? They'll have to find someone to pin the dirty deed on, as the sherrif is Steve Upton - Randolph Scott - and we know he won't rest until the killers are found.But Steve's got his own problems - his horse gets stolen from him by a bandit (Glenn Ford) who gets the drop on him - and he soon finds out that the bandit is none other than Cheyenne Rogers, aka Bill Smith, his old friend from Wyoming days past. Unfortunately Cheyenne has a price on his head - and it turns out, he was the guy who Uncle Willie was originally going to have pull the bank job until Clanton got tired of waiting for the delayed Cheyenne to show up. Now Cheyenne has to wait in town while his friend Nitro ('Big Boy' Williams) heals up after breaking his foot; stay away from Clanton and the bandits who want to put him in jail; romance Uncle Willie's daughter Allison (Evelyn Keyes), and argue with the (rather superfluous) Countess (Claire Trevor). Eventually of course his friendship with the Sheriff will be tested, there'll be drama involving the women, and showdowns will have to occur.This was a big-budget, prestige affair, a solidly ""A"" western with a top-flight cast, and Columbia's first film in Technicolor. Much of it was shot on location, and a horse stampede through town at the climax, and a truly spectacular and lengthy barroom brawl that basically destroys a large saloon show that the money is on the screen. Unfortunately, the too-large cast of not-well-developed characters, fairly dull and faceless villains, and the rather over-the-top humor (especially in the presence of 'Big Boy') take away what drama the story might have had and make this a fairly average, just watchable affair all around. I liked the character of Uncle Willie, a really gray and conflicted person, and I think Buchanan probably gives the best performance in the film - but there's too much emphasis on playing him for laughs when there is some real pathos in the character; there's a great scene where he's talking to his daughter in the stable as she's about to leave, and he mentions how this is what always happens when a kid grows up - beautifully done stuff, but the film ends up relying too much on slapstick and broad strokes, when there's a better and more serious story buried there itching to get out.  I'm not sure director Charles Vidor had a whole lot of sympathy for the genre either; there's very little feeling for the landscape or the frontier mentality here.Still the color, the action and characters make this worth a look - if not probably many rewatches.  I could almost give this another star, but I really think that this film suffers in comparison with some of Scott's better westerns of this period - notablyWestern Unionfrom a couple of years earlier - and is probably not going to have very wide appeal to any but the most devoted fans of the actors and westerns from this period.  Scott's 50s westerns are just about all worth watching and rewatching - some of his 40s work doesn't quite cut the mustard, and this is a typical example from an era when the genre was still trying to figure out how to go from the low-budget kiddie fare that exemplified the 1930s, to the much more serious films that make up the best examples of the 1950s.",N/A

1059586,"Probably Frank Borzage's best-known and generally best-regarded film, 7th HEAVEN was filmed at Fox with one of the first synchronized scores (also with some sound effects) though it is still considered a silent as it doesn't have dialogue, and this Hollywood Attic version utilizes a silent print with a nicely-done piano score by Keith Taylor.  The first of three films the director made starring Charles Farrell and Janet Gaynor, this was a huge critical and commercial success, winning Gaynor the first Oscar for Best Actress and Borzage and screenwriter Benjamin Glazer the first prizes in their categories. Glazer adapted a recently-popular play (by Austin Strong), and Gaynor and Farrell were two of the hottest young stars, so it was all in a all a match made in ""heaven"".  Surprise then that it's taken so long for a legitimate DVD release - at least, it's surprising until you start watching and see what kind of condition the film is in. The first couple of reels in particular are pretty tatty and speckly; though it does clear up after about 20-25 minutes this remains a somewhat rough print, so viewer beware.If you can get past the technical issues though, you are in for a rapturous Borzagian romantic fantasy, set primarily in the streets and gutters, and one spectacular 7th floor garret of a poor neighborhood in Paris just before and during the first world war. The plot is striking in its simplicity and spareness - waifish Diane, abused by her older sister, is almost beaten to death but saved by the noble if rather arrogant Chico, a sewer worker aspiring to higher things. Through Dickensian circumstance and coincidence Chico and Diane have to pretend to be married, and rather quickly fall in love and pledge to be married for real, before the God whom Chico despises and refuses. The war comes and the the two ecstatic lovers pledge to speak to each other at the same hour every day, but fate intervenes....or does it?It's up to the brilliant studio-bound expressionistic set design, Borzage's sensitive movement between ""action"" sequences (a rapidfire, excting shot of Diane running diagonally towards the camera mirrors similar sequences in Borzage's 1925 LAZYBONES and appears to be a trademark of sorts), lyrical movements describing the heavenward thoughts and feelings of the star-crossed lovers, and closeups of his two wonderfully expressive stars. Gaynor tends to get most of the credit, but on the strength of this film at least Farrell was a terrific presence, moving pretty effortlessly from joviality to tenderness and showing such a pure optimism and decency that you never wonder that he can turn Diane around from a scared child into a confident woman in just a few minutes of screen time. The secondary cast is pretty terrific as well, and it's probably the top-to-bottom quality here that for me bumps this slightly above LAZYBONES, and excellent film that is more obviously dominated by Buck Jones' tremendous lead work, and is of a little less interest when he's not on the screen.The ending is visionary and completely unrealistic, fantastic, and silly if you think too much about it, but the power of the film's film belief in love and truth, even in a God that I personally don't believe in, compelled me, and I hope would compel most, to want to accept it. Not many directors could ask you to take what is essentially a return from death in an otherwise ""realistic"" film and expect that you wouldn't laugh at it, but Borzage manages it.All in all then this is absolutely essentially stuff for silent film buffs, romantics, and heck, just anybody that loves and cares about the power of cinema to move, to feel, and to create a world larger than our own dull ones.  Also available on the expensiveMurnau, Borzage and Fox Box Setwhich looks to be very much worthwhile from what I've seen of it.",Seventh Heaven

Seriously, if I would have known in advance that Universal was releasing this collection in such disgustingly ridiculous packaging, I would have held out for the single disc releases.  I tend to go for packaged collections so this one seemed to be a no-brainer.  I literally sat and stared at the disc trays for a good 2 or 3 minutes studying them, waiting on that ""ohhhh I get it"" moment, and the discs would just come out of the trays with no problem. Boy was I wrong.  I seriously thought I was doing something wrong.  The trays do not have the standard hubs we are all used to.  The discs are held in place with these ridiculous plastic clips across the bottom and you literally have to pull the disc to one side while simultaneously bending the tray so the disc will pop out. Every time I open the box I start to get even more angry because I know what I'm in for and it takes tooooooo darn long to get the discs out.  It is THE biggest pain in the a$$.

877751,"""When you drive by a bakery and you jump out of a moving vehicle that's called a craving."" ~ John PinetteAfter watching ""I Say Nay Nay"" and ""I'm Stavin,"" I've decided that I like Nay Nay the best. Both DVDs have pretty much the same material with a few twists. John Pinette is one funny guy but he is also a pretty good singer and he sings quite a bit in this DVD.If you think being overweight stops you from having fun, think again! John Pinette has hilarious stories about water skiing, parasailing, cruising, white water rafting, amusement parks and water parks. He is also very well traveled and his stories of London and Paris are quite humorous. He also does accents very well.What I like most about John Pinette's act is how his stories flow from one to the other quite seamlessly. Like he tells all his stories about standing in line all at once so they are even funnier.John Pinette has been on diets for over 20 years so he knows all about exercising, personal trainers, the gym and nutritionists. I'm currently on the Medifast diet so everything John Pinette says about dieting makes complete sense.So if you are trying to decide between ""I'm Stavin"" and ""I Say Nay Nay"" go with the latter. I think it is better but mostly because I love to hear John sing.~The Rebecca Review",N/A
1354724,"Other reviewers are correct in noting that this DVD is made up of episodes and the Xmas specvial previously seen on the Disney Channel, and yes, I agree that it should not have been marketed as 'pre-order', as it could be expected to be new material.

My son especially liked the Xmas special in question, which is heavily layered with ""High School Musical"" type songs (Ashley Tinsdale, in fact, is on this disc), Phineas and Ferb saving Christmas for Danville and Perry The Platypus. There is also an extra episode, a virtual fireplace, a look behind the scenes of creating a P&F episode and so forth. Again, I do agree that it was marketed incorrectly, and so if you are Xmas shopping, make sure the recipient would want repeat eps (and there is nothing wrong with the DVD when it cuts to the next scene in a couple instances, repeating dialogue said before what was an original commercial break), and there should be no problem. Hopefully, next time Disney will be organized and upfront about their product so as to not scare off potential buyers!!!!",Disney Phineas & Ferb: A Very Perry Christmas

With the voice talents of Corey Feldman, Josh Pais, and featuring Elias Koteas, it is surprisingly good.The story takes a fairly mature tone that helps it appeal to a much broader age range than one might initially suppose.  The storyline is inclusive and rich, encompassing uncompromising emotional and physical trials for the Turtles.  Judith Hoag is decent as April O'Neill, the newswoman who befriends the Turtles.  The Turtles themselves, Leonardo, Michaelangelo, Donatello, and Raphael, spring into three-dimensional being in an achievement of visual effects that was fairly jaw-dropping by 1990 standards and holds up well today.  Elias Koteas is perfect as Casey Jones, the hockey-loving antihero whose compassion and good heart compel him to side with the Turtles.  The screenplay invests fairly minor characters with genuine fascination.  The wayward Danny Pennington, the son of April's boss, is an incisive sympathetic character, a symbol of goodness gone wrong.  He humanizes the danger the Foot Clan, the movie's evil martial arts gang, poses.Also starring character actor James Saito as the Turtles' enemy Shredder, ""Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles"" is surprisingly solid.  The film is rated PG for mature language and themes, and for bloodless yet staunch violence.",N/A
227696,"Alien was an interesting contrast to Star Wars.  That's where the cult started. Alien had a lot of good hard nosed reality to it. In the characters and their interactions who knew what hard work was all about. Alien saw a group of people fight and die due to human weaknesses and strengths.  Aliens mopped up and tried to finish off the aliens.They shifted from the miner's hard life to the Marines and succeeded in watching a non-technological species haress, frighten, and kill off the vast majority. Aliens also had an interesting survivor in a little eight year old girl Nute.  She also led the Marines in how to survive the aliens, for a little while at least.Bill Paxton from Terminator gives another great performance of a punk.  He's absolutelly hillarious in both Terminator and Aliens!  Michael Bien also comes from Terminator to give another good performance to fight off something bigger than a human. Another James Cameron find and favorite was introduced in Aliens, Jenette Goldstein.  She also later appreas in Terminator 2 and Titanic!No movie or book is perfect; so, I've gotten in the habit of starting with a four star no matter what.  Five star . . . i don't know what's five star.  Can I find fault with Aliens?  Yes!  There's the awkward gravity fields when the marines are free-falling from orbit; now, wait a minute!  First, they're in orbit; so, just releasing them wouldn't cause them to just start free-falling; if them, then why not the mother ship?  There's not much to find fault with the move though; but, i did find something, so, my principle of starting with four stars no matter what works here.I finish with noting that I've thought of a solution to Ripley and the Marines problem of dealing with all those aliens and still have seventeen days to go!  Simply pack that marines battlestation sports car with food and head far away from the atmospheric processing plant . . . till it can't run no more.

1258992,"Of all the films made about President Kennedy, none has ever given me a more intimate and almost visceral feel for the great and relentless burden upon his shoulders. Nor have I ever admired him as greatly as I do after watching Virtual Kennedy, after appreciating how steadfastly he resisted the push by his military advisers, the Republican Party and the media to go to war. A position which I believe clearly resulted in his death.Six times he resisted the drums of war, in just a thousand days. Having told the Joint Chiefs of Staff that he plainly and simply was not going to commit ground troops to Vietnam, period, this film makes the argument (along with recent books who look at the question) that it's almost inconceivable to imagine Kennedy sending in troops... it would have flown in the face of everything this man had stood for, had expressed both publicly and privately, and it would have gone against his very deep knowledge of international affairs, world history... not to mention his understanding of battle, having been there himself.A beautifully produced film with an ocean of press conference footage seldom if ever seen, and presented in long pieces so as to appreciate the President's body language, facial expression and most of all the anguish in his eyes as he attempted to answer questions from the media without giving details that he knew he could not reveal.. No flash-pow MTV editing here - this film was made by grown-ups.If you're looking for the usual fawning, celebrity idolatry of Camelot, this film is not for you. But for those who seriously want to understand the man and why he was taken from is, Virtual Kennedy will be an essential part of your video library. And it will leave you with an unusually profound sadness, not simply as is usually the case over his death (we don't need another video to open those wounds again, in that for most of us of a certain age those wounds have never healed.)

1180439,"Trading Babe Ruth.  Driving drunk.  Reality television.  Sex with interns.  Japanese zombie films.  Some things are just bad ideas.For decades Japanese filmmakers have excelled in making landmark samuraii films, superbly creepy supernatural films, or highly entertaining and erotic pink films.  Last year Asian filmakers even ventured into the vampire realm (THIRST) and nailed it like a stake through the heart.  And here with TOKYO ZOMBIE, they tried to breathe new life into the undead genre.  The only thing they succeeded in doing is being intentionally idiotic.Some might refer to this movie as a quirky gem.  Others might say it's so bad, it's good.  I can appreciate the imaginative efforts, but there's no other way around it--this is just plain dumb.It shambles along from the beginning in conventional zombie fashion--the undead causing mass hysteria in some Japanese city (I can't remember which one).  We get to witness a couple of rumblin' bumblin' stumblin' buddies struggle for survial.  The two sorta meet an annoying, foul-mouthed chick and decide to kidnap her.  Soon after catastrophe strikes.This leads to a major plot twist, which inevitably shifts the overall tone.  It goes from human survival mode to an unorthodox bourgegois clymphamatic social equalitarium rebuttal of psychological transferrance with a sole intent of entertaining the masses in a predominantly preordained aristocratic influx of societal reformation.  Basically what I mean is, it gets stupid trying to act smart.Lots of social commentary imbedded here in obvious fashion.  That's all well and good I suppose, except the film had too many other problems.  For one, the dialogue was atrocious...""Oh shutup! You sooo retarded!""Everybody got on my nerves.  I was begging for Long Duck to make an appearance and say something clever like ""No more hanky my wanky...the Donger need food!"".  No such luck.  The acting was intentionally over-the-top, and makes for a tiresome flick.This all would be easily forgiven if this movie had some freakin' action!  Please, some blood!  Gore!  Nudity!  Some hint of apocalyptic foreboding doom!  Anything!  Bad makeup and cheap effects are all the more noticeable when you don't spray the screen with some red stuff.  Sheesh!I don't know, maybe they were going for a silly PG-rated comedy with loads of social commentary that's disguised as a zombie film.  Was this a cure for insomnia, perhaps?  Or maybe this was aimed at comic book nerds with absolutely no life.  I'm not sure.  Either way, you will definitely appreciate life a little more once this movie is over.",N/A

1226484,"From Within has a pretty standard premise: small town with a dark secret unjustly murders a woman for witchcraft, witch takes revenge, townsfolk fall apart as their dark secret is unveiled and foolish teenagers pay the price.From Within plays with preconceived notions of who is wrong and right in the debate over fundamentalism by sprinkling forthright characters with dark secrets...and dark characters with dark secrets too.  Nobody's innocent.  Not Aidan (Thomas Dekker, Mr. John Connor himself) the goth pretty boy whose brother Sean (Shiloh Fernandez) committed suicide in front of his girlfriend (Rumor Willis), nor Dylan (Kelly Blatz) the son of a preacher man.  With Lindsay (Elizabeth Rice) in the middle, they form a peculiar love triangle that's not particularly convincing, as Dylan comes off as nothing more than a pious robot.  It's hard to conceive that he and Elizabeth had a relationship at all.The other characters, including Lindsay's boozy stepmother Trish (Laura Allen), her redneck boyfriend (Roy Adam) and the always-smiling Pastor Joe (Steven Culp) are all just about as awful as you might expect.  Christian fundamentalism is portrayed as just as ugly as alternative religions like Wicca.  It's not the mask of religion that's the problem, according to director Phedon Papamichael, it's what people are really like on the inside.  And with the exception of Lindsay, everyone is petty, vindictive, and self-centered.But this is a horror film with a curse at its center, and From Within doesn't disappoint.  The ghosts all appear as dead, animated doppelgangers of their future victims, providing a fun ""guess how they're gonna die"" game for the audience that has echoes inFinal Destination. The deaths all look like suicides, as the curse causes the victim to harm herself. There are two particularly inspired moments of creepiness, including a scene in a bathroom mirror and one confusing a bottle of whiskey with something a little stronger.From Within hits all the Japanese-horror highlights, including a viral curse, creepy girls with long hair concealing their faces, and encounters that are just as weird as they are frightening. The first living person to reach the most recent dead victim catches it.  This has to be the first social media curse.But what really propels From Within beyond the usual ghost story fare is the ending. Nihilistic and unflinching in its damning portrayal of everyone in the town, the director shows no mercy.  While that might not make for a happy ending, it sure makes for one heck of a twist.Not quite as good asThe Ringbut certainly better thanSeamstress, From Within is a worthy installment in American-style J-horror.",From Within
1201883,"*** This review may contain spoilers ***All romantic movies chronicle the progress of a romantic relationship as it (usually) triumphs over many small obstacles, or one major obstacle. In romantic fantasy movies, the obstacle or obstacles are supernatural. However, regardless of the nature of the obstacle, a romantic movie will succeed in moving us only if the couple portrayed is multifaceted, complex, sympathetic, sensible, and endearing. If the couple is not, they are in danger in being upstaged by the obstacle or obstacles opposing their union. In my opinion, ""The Time Traveler's Wife"" suffers from the latter condition.""The Time Traveler's Wife"" chronicles the tortured progress of the romantic relationship between Chicago librarian Henry DeTamble (Eric Bana) and heiress/aspiring artist Clare (Rachel McAdams). The obstacle that dogs them before and after their marriage is a diabolically tragic doozy: Henry is genetically predisposed to time travel randomly and unwillingly throughout his life (called chrono-displacement in the movie) whenever he is stressed, drunk, or emotionally distraught. Even worse, he must do so stark naked (a la the Terminator) because his clothing is not organic and therefore must find clothes in the time period he lands in (past, present, and even future) before he suffers social embarrassment, arrest for indecent exposure, or sickness like hypothermia. As I said, it's a doozy of a problem, and it detracts from Henry and Clare's relationship, sweet and gentle as it is.Of course, the time travel angle dredges up all the usual paradoxes (e.g. you can't change the past, alternate time-lines, past/present/future versions of yourself). But the movie complicates the paradox even further by having nearly infinite versions of Henry (from five-year old child to middle-age adult) flitting back and forth through time. Sometimes, implausibly, these different versions meet each other (wouldn't they explode on contact, like matter/anti-matter). Furthermore, Henry's appearances and disappearances are unpredictable. Not only does Clare not know when Henry will return from his bare romps, she doesn't even know which Henry will return. But she has the patience of Penelope waiting for Odysseus, and she treats Henry's condition mostly as an inconvenience.Clare's cavalier attitude towards Henry's condition is stupefying, even for a romantic fantasy. Doesn't she realize Henry is subject to a tragic curse? Why haven't the couple tried to find a cure earlier on in the relationship? Why didn't Henry and his father, who knows his son has the condition, try to cure him when he was a boy or a teenager? Life must have been hell growing up. Still, Henry amazingly appears to be a fundamentally well-adjusted and stable person. One would think his condition would have eroded his sanity and made him suicidal.Some posters advise to treat the time-travel angle as a plot device and just enjoy the budding romance and marriage. I couldn't. Without the suspense of knowing when and where Henry would vanish, the romance is actually pretty vapid and pedestrian. Henry and Clare certainly make an attractive, sexy couple, but they seem to be boring, ordinary people leading boring, ordinary lives. Even their creepily precocious daughter Alba is interesting only because she has inherited her father's time-traveling ability and can even control it to some extent. More detrimentally, Clare at times comes across as a slightly whiny, precious princess a bit too focused on her own needs. For example, she gets upset at Henry when he reappears after having missed Christmas and New Years. Honey, the dude can't help it. At that point, Harold Melvin and the Blue Notes' ""If You Don't Know Me By Now"" should have been playing on the soundtrack. Also, she wants a baby so desperately that even though one version of Henry (""the"" version, I guess) gets a vasectomy to avoid having a child who will suffer his curse, she ""cheats"" on that version with a younger, ""fully functional"" version of Henry and conceives Alba in a car in a Chicago parking lot.Not even death can really bring poor Henry release; toward the end of the movie, Henry reappears naked in the meadow where he first met his future bride when she was six. This time, however, it's winter and Clare's boorish hunter father mistakes him for a deer and kills him. No matter, there will always be another version of Henry (young or old) to visit and comfort Clare. So immortal love conquers all! Does it makes your eyes tear up? Oh, please, it made my eyes roll!If you want to see a better constructed and involving romantic fantasy involving the undeniably handsome and magnetic Eric Bana, I'd suggest watching Ang Lee's Hulk. His relationship with Jennifer Connelly's character is more intricate, plangent, and affecting. Besides, he gets to keep his pants on (most of the time) even after he transforms into the Hulk.P.S:  I theorize that Henry's chrono-displacement genes must be recessive, because neither of his parents could time travel.  Therefore, both parents must have been chrono-displacement gene carriers and gave their recessive genes to Henry when he was born.2.5 stars out of 5",N/A

502196,"This film has two different parts or halves: one is a light love story not very original:  Amy, a female architect falls in love with Virgil, a blind physiotherapist. This isn't much until you join the another part, because that's yes, a very big and I think very difficult neuro-physiological problem. Perhaps yes, in the USA that question has been attempted to cure. If yes, I don't know with what results.Because the core problem is Virgil, practically a person born blind so he never was able to see nothing, is submitted in New York to surgery of his congenital cataracts. Below this relatively simple problem of the eye, solved by ordinary surgery today, he has also the rare disease of retinitis pigmentosa. This disease is real in some few people but the question goes more far than the strictly clinical problem, as Virgil recovers the sight after surgery but although he sees with his eyes, he doesn't know nor understands what are the things and people he sees: the persons, the buildings... nothing. This is because the brain needs training in order  to interpret the images. Virgil's brain hasn't that training and he's yet a man over 30 years old.A hard question. The problem is similar to that of a person which hears a foreign unknown language: he hears, but doesn't understand nothing.This is an enormous problem as sight is a very delicate sense, very prone to false feelings.  I have my doubts if cinema is the best  mean to show this difficult question. The movie is solved in routine way but merited more than that.",At First Sight VHS
1365252,"I can enjoy fine movies with minimalist acting.  Where the actors spend a lot of time saying nothing, but looking very serious, or hurt, or angry or whatever.  The kind of the thing that lots of young American actors like to do these days.  Where emotions are bottled up.  This can be very effective.But sometimes, you just want to have a good, old-fashioned wallow in the kind of meaty, no-holds barred acting that, frankly, the British do best.  And the best, most satisfying example of that this year is THE KING'S SPEECH, a terrific, interesting, engrossing and surprisingly emotional film about a monarch who stutters.In the years between the two great wars of the 20th Century, King George V ruled England and its colonies with a stern disposition and unshakeable self-confidence.  His eldest son, Edward, is a dashing playboy type, but looks forward to his time on the throne.  Younger son Albert (""Bertie"") is shyer and more conservative...in large part because he has a rather pronounced stammer that years of consulting experts has done nothing to cure.  He has a strong wife in Elizabeth, and dotes on his daughters Elizabeth and Margaret.  And he has no ambitions to be king.His wife convinces him to start consulting with Speech Therapist Lionel Logue, a commoner with some highly uncomment techniques.  Not only does he work on the mechanics of speech, but he believes that stammers also come from a psychological place as well.  He's a sort of psychologist too.  He works with the prince, insists that two men work on a first name basis, and through sheer force of his eccentric personality, begins to wear the reserved Albert down to the point where we learn much about his upbringing.And then, as WWII nears, George V dies and Edward serves only briefly, because the scandal of his love affair with divorced American Wallace Simpson forces him from the throne...and George is horrified to find himself about to be crowned.  And eventually, George will have to give perhaps the most important nationwide radio address anyone had ever given in England up to that point...a speech rallying his people to the cause of war.  He can ill afford to stammer his way through a speech that needs to inspire confidence and patriotism.It's a fascinating story, utterly engrossing.  But it's the uniformly great acting that elevates this to such a high level.  Small but effective parts are handled by folks such as Michael Gambon (King George V...excellent), Derek Jacobi as the archbishop, Guy Pearce as King Edward (he's quite good) and Jennifer Ehle in a small but delightful role as Logue's wife.  Helena Bonham Carter is more restrained than usual, but also very effective as the Queen.  She clearly dotes on her husband, which makes her very sympathetic, yet she also shows that the trappings and conventions of royalty suit her.  The two appear to be that seeming rarity, a royal couple that are actually happy with each other.  But all this great acting is just icing on the cake for the pure movie-going joy of watching Colin Firth (as King George VI) and Geoffrey Rush (as the uncommon commoner) go toe-to-toe.  Both actors are at their finest.Rush can incline towards the hammy (as in the PIRATES OF THE CARRIBEAN movies) but when the script matches his natural characteristics (such as the unappreciated QUILLS)...he's just a joy to watch.  His timing is exquisite and his commitment to his work is amazing.  And Firth, though a more ""restrained"" actor, chews into his role with understated ferocity (this seems to make no sense...but see the film and you'll understand).  He makes his Bertie so sympathetic...but rather than just playing a shy stammerer, we see his integrity, his wit, his pain and his explosive temper.  His struggle against the casual attitude Logue takes with him is so much fun to watch, as are the great moments these two have together when they discover how well the King speaks when he is cursing.  The two develop an odd but deeply affecting friendship.  I don't know if the film presents history accurately...but it sure presents history as it would be nice to believe it happened.  Both actors should be slam dunks for Oscar nominations...and Firth will be hard to beat.  It may be his best ""upper class British"" performance to date.The film is a bit manipulative. The climactic moments being heavily punctuated with Beethoven seems a bit heavy handed.  Some of the dialogue is just TOO good to be believed.  But the two actors and their co-stars plow right through any weaknesses or pandering to the audience.  A measure of the success of the film...my 23 year old son and 18 year old daughter loved it.  For a film so far out of my son's comfort zone to grab him to the extent it did says a lot.  This is a film worth seeking out and seeing immediately.",N/A

236629,"I watched this movie when it first came out in 1984 and it made an indelible impact on me. I don't remember LOVING the film but I did respect it. The movie was probably a more cerebral and realistic interpretation of Tarzan than my 14 year old self was prepared to fully accept. The producers made some fairly radical changes to Tarzan and the storyline but this is one of those rare instances where the film actually improves on the book and in many cases the improvements are dramatic and profound.Perhaps nothing is more emblematic of the changes that the producers made than the fact that at no point in the movie is the Ape Man ever referred to as Tarzan. The name `Tarzan' was given to John Clayton by the apes but that makes no sense. `Tarzan' is not a word that an Ape could even pronounce. If his name was `Ooh-ah' it might make sense. In order to keep the movie within the realm of reality Tarzan had to lose his name and it was the right thing to do. The story also drops the racism, the jungle machismo and Tarzan's preternatural ability to learn languages and customs at a rate far beyond anything conceivable.Let me start with the few problems that the film introduces that weren't present in the book. John Clayton's ability to learn languages has been significantly toned down from the books but he still absorbs at a very fast pace and to explain this the film's writer established Clayton as a skilled mimic. That's all well and good except that Clayton can mimic both human and animal and when the Clayton mimic's an animal it is OBVIOUS that the director just dubbed in actual animal sounds and it just looks silly and cartoonish. This gimmick is used an unfortunate amount of times and brings unintentional humor to more serious scenes. The second problem was in having Clayton meet Jane Porter only after he had traveled to England. In the book Jane sees her `Jungle God' in his element in full glory. It's perfectly believable that she would swoon at the sight of the powerful bronzed warrior. In the movie Jane only sees the bewildered, out of place John Clayton. Sure he shows some signs of bravery and aggression but nothing like in the book where he literally kills a lion with his bare hands (ok, he did have a knife).The biggest difference between the movie and the book is in the second half where John Clayton travels to England to his ancestral home of Greystoke. In the book he made a quick journey to Wisconsin to see Jane but only at the very end of the story. Burroughs Tarzan seems perfectly comfortable in the advanced world whereas the movies Clayton is a complete fish out of water. It's even more than that, Clayton has a very difficult time adjusting and in moments of stress finds himself falling back on his ape like tendencies. There is one awesome scene where Clayton is alone on his first night at Greystoke. He releases his stress by rolling around on the floor making ape sounds. When actor Christopher Lambert make these `ooh ooh' sounds, extends his lips or hunches down it's embarrassing and undignified but that's the point. Clayton was raised by apes and being an ape is his comfort zone. By having Clayton act in this way the movie greatly improves on the story even if it often reaches the level of uncomfortable. I hate to label Clayton as having mental problems but if being incapable of conforming to the standards of the general public defines one as having mental problems than this is clearly Clayton's state. Of course he cannot conform to public standards, this world is completely foreign to him and naturally someone untrained in human interaction is going to act in ways that are uncomfortable and embarrassing. If anything the movie massively downplays the troubles of integrating a feral adult into society and in the end Clayton has no choice but to return to his natural environment.In the finale John Clayton transforms from the Earl of Graystoke into Tarzan for all time. Stripped nearly naked he sinks back into the jungle perhaps the only man alive who could live comfortably in an African jungle with nothing more than a loincloth and a knife. John Clayton is a god in the jungle at the expense of being able to live in modern society. Burroughs did not make this sacrifice and his Tarzan moved seamlessly between the realm of the jungle and mankind. It is to the movies credit that it created a much more well rounded believable character.The movie is a success on so many levels including the wonderful performance by newcomer (at the time) Christopher Lambert but the acting is quite good all around. The apes are played by humans in costumes and it isn't perfect but it's good enough to not be distracting (at least for me). The shots are beautiful and the movie is stirring. For me this is THE quintessential Tarzan movie even if he's never called Tarzan.",N/A

Although,my two favorite people are Sweets and the prosecutor(her one liners are awesome). I even think Booth's grandfather, Brennen's father,and Angela's father all add something to the series.Way to go in keeping this series Awesome!!!!!",Bones: Season 5

When there was no television, where there was a wonderful sense of family, this movie could let one sit back and forget for just a little while what is going on in one's life and the surrounding life when one walks out through the door into ""today"".  This is a wonderful movie and I highly recommend it for everyone.  I have always loved Little House on the Praire....I watched it extensively when it was on TV.  It was a joy to watch how everyone put Christmas together the ""right"" way.  I watch all my Christmas movies every year....and the list is getting extensive....but this one I will put high up there with some of my favorites like It's a Wonderful Life and Mircle on 34th Street and The Christmas Carol.  Everyone should have this special Christmas movie to watch every year just for that little while when one can become absorbed into another time when things were more peaceful and family and friends meant everything.",N/A

75055,"As the second installment of the &#34;Rambo&#34; saga, this film definitely ups-the-ante in terms of action and body count. &#34;Rambo: First Blood Part II&#34; takes Rambo back to the jungles of Vietnam, where most of the mental traumas that dog him began. His mission is to search for missing POWs, instead he falls right back into a war that, for him, has never really ended.As I said, the action in this film goes way beyond anything we saw in the first one (but with James Cameron as one of the screenplay writers, that's not exactly a surprise). Less content to let the personal and political dramas propel the action, this film is pretty much the reverse, with the action being cause to create those plot developments. In many way, this film seems to forget the humanity shown in the original and opts to let the excitement of the moment wash over you, like the backwash of an F-16 fighter jet, as the explosive battle sequences blast you against the back wall. Although, while extremely over the top in almost every stunt and fight, to the point ungodly suspension of disbelief is pretty much the order of the day, it is a beautifully choreographed bloodbath to behold. It basically, for good or ill, set the stage for what the 80's action epic would be expected to achieve for the rest of the decade.While not exactly a deeply emotive character in the first film, Sly gets even less moments here. There is no understanding to what Rambo is feeling being back in the place that has tortured him so. There is almost no attempt to play on those feelings at all, save an all-too-brief scene on a boat, between Rambo and the young Vietnamese woman (played by Julia Nickson) who is helping him in the mission, but that's as far as they go to give you any idea on what Rambo is thinking and feeling, being back in 'Nam after all this time. I would have liked to get into Rambo's thoughts more, as the traumas he'd suffered there could have added even more depth to an emotionally complex character. But that simply isn't what this film was about.Richard Crenna reprises his role, as Rambo's C.O., but he gets very little to do in this film. Whereas in the first he was a key to understanding Rambo and used to contrast the political themes that were presented, here he is merely a very small cog, used mainly to set up the plot to get Rambo back into action. He does have one very intense scene, where he argues with the slimy Washington bureaucrat (played by Charles Napier), which brought back a momentary flair from the first film, but it is over quickly, as the need to get back to the jungle slaughter is the paramount concern here.&#34;Rambo: First Blood Part II&#34; was less the ending of an iconic character's saga (not the least of which is due to the fact two more sequels were made) and more the start of replacing character-driven action, with action-driven drama. It created a new standard for what action films could be (and in many cases, would be) from that point on. It set up a game of constant oneupmanship with the other action stars of the day, as they all attempted to outdo what this film began. In some ways, this film is almost a whole new entity, completely separate from the original film in every thing but the characters names, yet it is also strangely completely bound to it. As a sequel to a film that had some very deep philosophical and political themes, this film fails to recapture almost any of that same spirit, but in terms of spinning the action film genre into an ever growing and testosterone-fueled behemoth, determined to make the impossible seem probable, as well as solidifying Rambo's status as an 80's icon for all-time, the film succeeds on a level no other film could ever hope to manage. This is truly the film that epitomizes the phrase, &#34;check your brain at the door and enjoy!&#34; Which I am more than able to do.",N/A

1247276,"I knew nothing about The Crazies going into the theater.  I didn't know it was originally produced by the father of the zombie genre, George Romero.  And I didn't expect to see a movie about a sheriff (Timothy Olyphant) and his pregnant wife (Radha Mitchell) with my own wife six months pregnant. Please note: this review contains spoilers.The movie starts out slowly.  In these stressful times, we're all too familiar with scenes of sudden gun violence in an idyllic setting.  After sheriff Dutton is forced to gun down a former town drunk on a little league field, the town of Ogden Marsh begins to unravel.  Everybody knows everybody else in this small town and a murder leaves emotional aftershocks that traumatize its citizens. This includes Dutton's wife, who happens to be the town doctor.The tension slowly notches up from there. These early moments are critical in establishing The Crazies as a superior horror film. The petty rivalries, the secret and not-so-secret grudges, the sadistic bullies - all of the townsfolk's deepest impulses are let loose through the TRIXIE virus, a military bioweapon that has accidentally (?) contaminated the town.Unlike so many other horror movies, Dutton and his deputy Clank (Joe Anderson) are precisely the people who should be dealing with an outbreak.  The problem is that they are little fish in a very big pond.  The movie quickly morphs from a slasher flick to survival horror when the military gets called in, loses control, and pulls out.What makes The Crazies so refreshing is that it plays on horror tropes, using it to narrative advantage.  We find out that the soldiers who are executing townsfolk aren't faceless, that the TRIXIE virus may or may not be transmitted through the water supply, and that taking one's temperature isn't a guaranteed means of identifying who's infected. The Crazies makes no promises but always delivers.This ambiguity may frustrate some people who expect everything to be wrapped in a neat bow, but director Breck Eisner knows that there is horror in uncertainty.  It's precisely this lack of clarity that makes the movie so good - the villains aren't unilaterally evil, the victims aren't always helpless, and the solutions aren't always moral.  The Crazies wallows in the gray area of harsh decisions, treating an outbreak with all the ethical gravity of a war.Let there be no doubt, this is as much a war movie as it is a horror movie. The real crazies, Eisner seems to say, is anyone who would trust authority. These days, that may not be such bad advice.P.S. Stay through the credits!",N/A
330927,"La battaglia di Algeri - The Battle for Algeria (1966) fromDirector Gillo Pontecorvo, is a monumental achievement, an epicthat leaves no stone unturned, no taboo unexposed, no analyticalpossibility unconsidered, no emotion unfelt. A like this one canchange lives, can wake spectators from their political doldrums.This work is fascinating for those having a limited knowledge orexposure to civilization in the Maghreb, the last 130 yearshistory, how local people present themselves day to day in public,colonialism, etc. In the 1950's and 60's, modern day Algeria wasdivided into what was called the ""Casbah"" (ghetto of 80,000) andthe ""European city"". Trades blossomed as seen also in any otherMediterranean or European city,  shops and cars, the onlydifference the language, the attire of women, the religion andsocial values.The picture brings back a time when the military institution wasstill indispensable to national security, to national identity, tothe economy, the psychology of each and every person as everycitizen turning 18 was conscripted for a minimum term of 2 years,either to the army or to the police corps -  no longer the case in2010,  with a professional volunteer army.The Cold War is still very visible, Cuba, USSR, Eastern nationsand others adhering to a particular political ideology, ascompared to the West. In this respect, allowing Algeria to walk inthe footsteps of India, Pakistan and Bangladesh toauto-determination was a risk, from possible changing to eitherrival system.From a DVD release perspective, there is a remarkable clarity toeach and every scene, a natural richness which is impressive andreal to this day. Even the night scenes are crystal clear, as isthe soundtrack and music on a 5.1 home theatre, by EnnioMorricone. The dialog and subtitles in Spanish are perfect.The story revolves around guerrillas within city confines in 1954,both the French Army and the Mujahideen experts in the assemblingand operation of IED's, disguises, shootout in plain view, themajority population caught in the middle.Various aspects are covered, such as occupying forces,paratroopers, helicopters, opponents rolling over,  waterboarding, electric shocks,  rope suspension, blow torchinterrogations, checkpoints, surveillance tapes.The justice system locally, when called upon, used the guillotineto carry out sentences, asrandom police officers were taken out orstabbed, and precincts overrun.The tenacity of the ideology is such as the instinct forself-preservation in some cases, disappears entirely, giving wayto a desire in making a dent in the enemy. Members are sternlywarned against partaking in the city's narcotics, gambling,brothel and alcohol services, which are long-standing.Barbed wire is deployed at key points in the city, with sandbags,with sentinels.The French troops head Col Mathieu, and the rebels, realize thatthe conflict is won in the hearts and minds of its  citizens, andnot only on the ground such that, both sides adopt propagandamethods (radio, blow horn, freebies, good PR) - despite suggestingthe resistance is a tape worm, requiring strong opposing actions.In 1962, France relinquishes its power over the colony.",Battle of Algiers VHS

1123413,"Two faiths, two empires, two rulers, colliding in 1588. Papist Spain wants to bring down the heretic Elizabeth. Philip is building an armada but needs a rationale to attack. With covert intrigue, Spain sets a trap for the Queen and her principal secretary, Walsingham, using as a pawn Elizabeth's cousin Mary Stuart, who's under house arrest in the North. The trap springs, and the armada sets sail, to rendezvous with French ground forces and to attack. During these months, the Virgin Queen falls in love with Walter Raleigh, keeping him close to court and away from the sea and America. Director Kapur interestingly puts dramatic and chilling appeal and emphasis on Elizabeth's Golden Age to reveal her personality and struggles to keep her throne and save her country from falling into the hands of conspirators and invaders. Blanchett is magnificent in her strange, enigmatic and multi-dimensional character, constantly faced with the challenges of her foes plotting and counter-plotting to take her down at her Court, in her government, and, from foreign lands. This movie does entertain, sending me on a delightfully exciting spell-bound journey to separate legend and myths from historical facts.

The movie does have some gore shots in it that are outrageous but not as wild as lets say dead alive' which is from new zealand too.  If you don't enjoy horror movies you won't enjoy this one and if you take horror really serious then you won't like this either but most people who reviewed this liked it because it is a good movie of this type. The acting is good and the effects are great and they are not computer generated but they look great, often cgi should only be used as a overlay on real makeup effects instead of the whole image because it doesn't look as realistic  unless they have tons of money to spend on cgi.  The dvd looks great and the print has no artifacts so this well worth checking out and adding to your horror collection. It's got humour and effects and a general loopiness to it but it has a straight forward plot. It has a beginning and a end and it makes sense. which is another reason to catch this one if  you are a fan of this type of movie because it's a very good one of it's type.",N/A

Choi begins to realise things are not what they should be ,especially when he discovers his patrol has one more man than it started with.The men begin to die ,and the director keeps matters ambiguous as to whether this is due to some supernatural agency ,or the men killing each other as they fall victim to madness and paranoia.This is a movie operating on atmosphere and suggestion rather than gross-out and will not please those who like their scares up front and in your face .It makes excellent use of the dark ,creepy and broody ruins rather than going for sudden jump cuts and shocks.The narrative is at times disjointed and the characters are the stock types found in any patrol movie from any movie industry the world over and one dance party sequence is hideously misjudged and defuses tension .

1344914,"***NOTE - I typed this review before the DVD was released, and I made an incorrect guess regarding the NYR 2005 Chamber Match.  Thanks to a few comments, I've learned that Chris Benoit is indeed in this collection, and has not been edited out.  I won't change the review because I don't wanna pretend that I knew how this would turn out.  But please be assured that this anthology is complete.***You know, sometimes match-by-match reviews aren't my favorite way to approach a WWE DVD.  I mean, what could I possibly add to this anthology?  I pretty much love the ones most fans love, have the same least favorites as most fans, leaving only a couple in the middle to debate over.Nothing wrong with that, I suppose.But in case, you're unfamiliar with any of these matches, I'll give you a quick rundown:#1) Nov. 2002 - Survivor Series - New York City---""Why Check It Out?""It's the first, it's one of the best, and every one of it's contenders could've walked away as World Heavyweight champion.  Shawn Michaels' title win is an emotional moment, and a promising sign that maybe his ""SummerSlam 2002"" comeback wasn't a one-trick pony.  He's got some funny brown pants, too.  Oh, and Triple H takes a vicious beating from bell to bell.---""Any Problems?""When it gets to the final 3 guys, it becomes a glorified handicap match for longer than I would've liked.  And again, HBK's got some ridiculous brown pants.  Other than that, not much to complain about.""8.0 / 10""_____________________________________#2) Aug. 2003 - SummerSlam - Phoenix, AZ---""Why Check It Out?""It starts off very good when Shawn Michaels and Chris Jericho engage in a back-and-forth technical showdown.  Also, guys like Kevin Nash and Goldberg never participated in another Chamber Match.  Finally, as cheap as the finish was (to protect Triple H's injury), it's easier to accept what the creative team was going for.---""Any Problems?""Once Goldberg enters, it's all downhill.  He wipes the floor with everyone in the match, and then he loses very quickly to HHH (thanks to some help from Ric Flair).  Some will see this as a huge ripoff.""7.0 / 10""_____________________________________#3) Jan. 2005 - New Year's Revolution - San Juan, Puerto Rico*****Unfortunately, due to the Benoit family tragedy from June 2007, WWE will probably only show this match in clips.  I'm one of those fans who believes that Chris Benoit and Nancy Benoit shouldn't be censored from WWE.  However, WWE will likely show the final 10 minutes or so, letting us witness Triple H winning his 10th world title.*****---""What Can I Do?""Buy the ""New Year's Revolution 2005"" DVD for a very cheap price.  Amazon sellers aren't very greedy with this disc, so just fork the cash, and watch what many consider to be the best Elimination Chamber Match.""8.5 / 10"" (in its entirety, of course)_____________________________________#4) Jan. 2006 - New Year's Revolution - Albany, NY---""Why Check It Out?""Other than the sweet twist that took place after the match, this Chamber Match is quite good.  Surprisingly, Carlito and Chris Masters (relatively new to WWE) looked like possible championship winners.  And hearing the Albany crowd go insane for Kurt Angle (he won his 1st WWF Championship there) is awesome.---""Any Problems?""It's a shame that Kane and Kurt Angle were made to look the weakest, especially since Angle won ""SmackDown""'s belt shortly after this night.  And as cool as it was to see Carlito and Chris Masters close out the match, it was pretty obvious that John Cena would retain his title against these foes.""8.0 / 10""_____________________________________#5) Dec. 2006 - ECW December To Dismember - Augusta, GA---""Why Check It Out?""It's the only Elimination Chamber Match to feature only ECW talent, as well as the only to feature weapons inside the chamber itself.  I personally don't hate this match, but if WWE chooses to keep the crowd's reactions, then you're in for some hilarious chants from displeased fans.  At the very least, it's a piece of history.---""Any Problems?""Well, fan-favorites Rob Van Dam and CM Punk don't last very long in the match.  Also, ECW veteran Sabu was jumped backstage and replaced by Hardcore Holly, which ticked fans off even more.  As for Big Show, I think we fans forgot how gifted he was until he came back from his year-long break.  And Bobby Lashley will always be ""Black Lesnar"" in my book - talented but uncharismatic.""6.0 / 10""_____________________________________#6) and #7) Feb. 2008 - No Way Out - Las Vegas, NV---""Why Check It Out?""This is the very first PPV to feature two Elimination Chamber Matches, both of them for the #1 Contender spots at ""WrestleMania XXIV"".  The ""SmackDown"" contest (also including ECW's Big Daddy V) is just a monstrous collection of wrestlers, highlighting the likes of Undertaker and Batista.  Also, it was refreshing to see the first two participants duke it out in the end.  As for the ""RAW"" main event, the whole match moves at a very fast pace, wisely starting off with Jericho and HBK again.  Also, Jeff Hardy's quest to reach the main event status was well-teased.  We were mad that he didn't win, but were loyal enough to wait until his next opportunity.---""Any Problems?""I don't have many problems with the ""RAW"" Chamber Match, other than Triple H winning it.  I don't believe HHH is a career-killing guy at all, but this gives the conspiracy theorists a lot of fuel for the fire.  However, I think the ""SmackDown"" Chamber Match is my least favorite to date.  It's just not very exciting once you get used to seeing all those giant athletes mix it up.  And the smaller guys like Finlay and MVP didn't get to do very much.""5.5 / 10"" (""SmackDown"" Match)""7.5 / 10"" (""RAW"" Match)_____________________________________#8) and #9) Feb. 2009 - No Way Out - Seattle, WA---""Why Check It Out?""Once again, the WWE booked two Elimination Chamber Matches, this time both were for the titles.  The ""SmackDown"" opener starts and ends very well, with the shocking quick elimination of WWE champion Edge, to the seesaw battle between Jeff Hardy and Triple H and Undertaker.  The ""RAW"" main event was compelling from start to finish.  We were given the surprise appearance of Edge (he beat up and replaced Kofi Kingston), and the surprise elimination of World Heavyweight champion John Cena (much to the delight of anti-Cena fans).  The lesser-known giant Mike Knox shined fairly well, while Chris Jericho and Rey Mysterio showed off their superior skills as veteran performers.---""Any Problems?""I don't have too many issues with the ""RAW"" main event once again, other than maybe seeing Kane once again not be booked as a serious contender.  The ""SmackDown"" Chamber match gets dreadully slow once Vladimir Kozlov and Big Show just gang up on Jeff hardy for 10 minutes, and dwarf Triple H for another 5 minutes.  It's a real patience-tester for those who don't like handicap situations, especially because these beatdowns take up a third of the match.""6.5 / 10"" (""SmackDown"" Match)""8.0 / 10"" (""RAW"" Match)_____________________________________#10) and #11) Feb. 2010 - Elimination Chamber - St. Louis, MO---""Why Check It Out?""To be honest, I haven't seen these matches, but if the PPV is as forgettable as I've read, I guess you might as well buy this set.---""Any Problems?""Well, I've read this PPV isn't very good, so this otherwise-solid collection might end on a weak note.  Again, this is just what I've heard, and not my own personal viewing reactions._____________________________________So, the way I see it, we've only got a few problems that potential buyers should be aware of:1) The NYR 2005 (Chamber Match #3) isn't shown in full.  You'll have to buy the inexpensive PPV disc (or go to YouTube) to get it.  It's not a big deal, but completists have a right to be upset.2) This is gonna sound weird, but a handful of these Elimination Chamber Matches are part of PPVs that I think any WWE fan should buy.  I strongly recommend the ""Survivor Series 2002"" and ""No Way Out 2009"" discs for their strong quality overall.  So, in a weird way, this anthology might discourage collectors from seeking out those good sets.I'm a collector who enjoys PPVs from start to finish, but if you're dying for some Elimination Chamber action and don't wanna sit through the other stuff, then I recommend this set.  It's a good collection of matches, with more diversity and creativity than you might think.",N/A
1257474,"Brad Wright does say that some fans will hate him for what he did with this pilot.  Well I don't!  A masterful job and I've been a fan since the Kurt Russell movie!Brad Wright went back to his original 1994 pilot and cleaned it up; he changed several scenes, added CGI in a few places that  needed it (without the invasive stuff that plagued Star Wars: A New Hope when Lucas tried the same thing), got rid of the scratches and marks, and even had Christopher Judge redo a few scenes to make it come across better.I do miss the nude scene with Ms. Bandera, sigh.  But I digress.Watching this reawakened my love for this series and why it lasted for ten full years of excitement and adventure.  The big, bad Goauld, the betrayal of T'lck, the struggle between military orders and humanity by General Hammond.I forgot how much tougher the military was in this pilot.  They really, really wanted to set off that nuclear bomb and send it through the gate!  Even Hammond was saying how much he just wanted to bury the damn thing and wish they never unearthed the thing.And the actors are so young!  The meeting with Captain Carter was cleaned up to where she is not bragging about her reproductive organs being on the inside than the outside...blah blah.  If you have seen the original original, you know this did not work well at all.  Brad Wright cut all that and with some re-editing made it a much more positive meeting.The development of the plot points and the establishment of Apophus and the loss of Shari and Skara was very intense.A dedication to the memory of Don S. Davis, the actor who played General Hammond and passed away in 2008, was a touching thought.The DVD has a making-of, an interview with Wright, and a discussion of the many changes that were done with the pilot.

1284753,"The Crime Syndicate has always been a favorite of mine since reading reprints of Fox's original Earth-Three version of JLA #29 (Aug 1964) and for a long time the only thing even close in attitude to them in animated form had been the SuperEnemies in the ""Universe of Evil"" episode of the 1979 ""World's Greatest SuperFriends"".  Morrison's Anti-matter Crime Syndicate of America in 2000 brought a re-imagined Crime Syndicate to a new generation of readers and the 2009 Batman: The Brave and the Bold episode ""Deep Cover for Batman!"" gave us the animated Injustice Syndicate which was again close but not quite there.This Crime Syndicate captures elements seen in the versions that came before.  The public being against the Crime Syndicate as well as bomb Owlman is building (a variation of a right at the end plot twist) is nearly straight from Fox's 1964 version, the ruthlessness and tough attitude of the SuperEnemies and Injustice Syndicate is there, as is the mob like mentality seen in Morrison's version and expanded in the Syndicate Rules saga.Unlike the Justice Lords of the JL episode ""A Better World"" this version of the Crime Syndicate like all the other versions does not see themselves as heroes doing what needs to be done for the betterment of all but as criminals taking what they feel they ""deserve"" and not above doing whatever they need to do to make sure they get it.As long as you go into this with the mindset that this is NOT an an adaptation of any one story (even though the Morrison's version clearly has the largest influence) you should enjoy this.",N/A
65756,"I seriously don't get the appeal of In Dreams.  Yes, it's about a psycho who enters a womans dreams and shows her the past and the future.  Of course it's so confusing knowing which one is which that I honestly had more trouble just following along to the plot than anything else.In addition to that, the woman who plays lead characters spends WAY too much time screaming her head off and never acting normal even for a *second* so the entire film ended up giving me a headache.I understand she'd freak out during one scene involving her daughter by a lake, but for the most part, she was extremely hard to deal with thanks entirely to her nonstop screaming.  It was completely out of control to an annoying extent.Sometimes I just don't get what the writers are going for, and this *extremely* confusing storyline is a perfect example of ""I don't get it"" that I've ever seen.  You just don't know what's going on half the time... no no, make that 25% of the time.

The actors are perfectly cast. Although Arthur Edmund Carewe has a small part in the movie, he certainly stands out and gives one of his best performances. I had to do a double-take at first, because he did not look like the Mr. Carew I saw in Phantom of the Opera. There is a eery feeling throughout and the backdrops are beautifully gothic. The camera play is excellent for the time, watch the movement and different pitches...wonderfully done. Everything about this movie is 5-star, from the acting, the use of camera and the music. A MUST HAVE if you are an old movie buff like me. This one has to be in your collection if you are a seeker of great old horror movies.",The Cat and the Canary
282702,"&#34;Motel Hell&#34; is quite a difficult film to gauge. It is referred to as a horror-comedy, but that description isn't very accurate, as it is more weird than funny and more macabre than scary.The story revolves around a couple of hoteliers (played by Rory Calhoun and Nancy Parsons), who have a side business selling fine smoked meats. But what makes the meats so good is the terrifying secret ingredient of human flesh.I have to say, going into this film, I wasn't quite sure what to expect. With cannibalism being a factor in the film, you might be expecting a lot of gruesome scenes. Yet, surprisingly, there is very little in the way of graphic gore to be found. The story is also a bit odd, in that there are some scenes that seem to drag on, yet give you little in the way of a pay-off. Also, most of the acting is fairly poor. Whether this is due to the lack of skills of the actors, or a case of a script that gives them little to work with, I can't really say. The side drama about the love triangle involving Terry (played by Nina Axelrod) and the brother of the cannibal farmer, who is also the town's Sheriff (played by Paul Linke), is little more than a strained (and sometimes dull) attempt to set up the final conflict between the brothers. Although, the film can boast of being an early work for actor John Ratzenberger (who would go onto heights of television fame on the series &#34;Cheers&#34;). Unfortunately, he gets very little to do in the film (including not a single piece of dialog) being nothing more than a victim to be killed. Director Kevin Connor never really seems to bring the story to life, until towards the very end. And if you haven't found yourself engaged long before that point, it probably won't much matter to you. The cinematography is fine, but it feels like it would play better on an old drive-in screen, than on your television, which is probably only fitting, as the film was obviously geared for such a venue.The only things that save this film from the scrap pile, are the last 20 minutes of the film and the solid performance of Rory Calhoun as the cannibalistic farmer. He manages to make you believe both his down-home country manners and his twisted psychotic reasoning in killing people for food. His performance stands high above anyone else in the film. And the final battle at the film's end also brings a spark of life to what, up until this point, has been a very strange and slow-moving tale. When Calhoun's character comes out wearing a pig's head and wielding a chainsaw, it is truly a sight to behold.As I said at the start, &#34;Motel Hell&#34; is a hard film to figure out. It's not really good and looks extremely dated today, but neither is it total crap and completely uninteresting. Die-hard horror buffs might want to check this one out, but I highly doubt many others would have much interest in this cult film. It really is an enigma in the world of horror cinema.",Motel Hell VHS
1203924,"16-year old Arizona resident Bella Swan (Kirsten Stewart) just flew from Phoenix to the small town of Forks Washington where she now lives with her father Sheriff Swan (Billy Burke). She meets some new friends including secret werewolf Jacob Black (Taylor Lautner)and Jasper (Jackson Rathborn) as she is getting use to her new home away from her mother. One day she spots a handsome 17 year old male named Edward Cullen (Robert Pattison) who she falls for as well as he falls for her, he even introduces her to his bizarre pale white like Michael Jackson family called The Cullens (Ashley Greene, Peter Facinellim, Elizabeth Reasner Kellan Lutz) where they act strange. Later on she realizes that he's a vampire for real but a different one as he belongs to a race of bloodsuckers that are part vegetarian when human but when vampire they drink blood of animals and humans, they also shine in the sun without burning due to their hard diamond skin and have eyes that make them look different in people. It seems three rival vampires named Laurent (Edo Gathegi), James (Cam Gianadet) and sexy Victoria (Rachelle Lefevre) want to make a meal of Bella but not for long.Highly entertaining supernatural horror love story fantasy flick based on the widely popular ""Twilight"" books from Stephanie Meyers. This is one of those love them, like them or hate them movies as well as the books are in that category but i would consider this a pure guilty pleasure from start since i like both being a straight 27 year old male. Some say this is aimed at teenagers and women but i don't think so, this works quite well in mixing horror with fantasy and adolescent love all rolled into one. It's a very interesting take on vampire mythology though it does have some flaws like probably one of the dumbest as a vampire can sparkle during the sunlight, i mean OK we get it! their skin are as hard as diamonds, no need to have it literal that they came out of a diamond mining facility. There is some foxy female vampires for the guys out there like Rachelle Lefevre who is just a babe as she can drain my bloody anytime and some action in places with an imaginative baseball playing sequence to show how strong a vampire could be. It's nowhere near as great as ""Titanic"" or ""Ghost"" when it comes to big screen love stories but it's worth watching.This Blu-Ray shows the film in a fantastic presentation of quality sound and theatrical clear quality picture.

1316916,"((Here is my approach to obtaining/viewing/reviewing Gay tales in film form. Simply, it's seeking the holy grail of that genre, or looking for the ""Addictive Film""---that movie one returns to time and again). Selection/purchase is based mainly on finding new releases by favorite directors/screenwriters and/or your comments/reviews at major online film sales or review sites. Sometimes I feel correctly steered by you (the ""Keepers"" filling my DVD shelves), other times mislead, occasionally badly (the ""Throwaways""----and I do toss 'em). Rarely, I come across the ""Addictive,"" those watchable every couple of months or sooner.......and some ""near-addictive"" as well). For some movies, I'll share a review with you, as follows. Thanks for sticking with me so far.))After three viewings (believe me, this film is so well done that repeats weren't hard to do), I'm ready to sit here and share with you.By writer / director intention, this is a ""grieving film"" (and you have been told, above, what it is not).  So now that you know their approach in this film, ask yourself, dear reader, the following question.  How shocking would it be for you to suddenly learn that, in the life of a now departed dearest friend (and unrequited love interest), there existed a far away, rival for the affections you had long sought?  For some of us that might be devastating.  So, with this plot lead-in out of the way, what we are left with for the remainder of this film are two grieving men who have been (and are still, it appears) in love with the same man.  Fate throws them together at this story's beginning, and as we watch we see ""feelings"" develop and grow between them.  At the same time, we come to realize that until this pair truly and completely comes to terms with the event that caused them to meet, there likely will be no future together for them.  (Although, to me the movie's ending gave hope that such a future might be delayed, but probably not denied).Oops, sorry about that......just watched the DVD Special Feature's Director & Writer Commentary, and these two guys seem to shoot down any intent of there being a future together for our two leads.  Plus in an offsite interview, writer/actor, Allesandro Calza (a bedroom-eyed hottie, playing Italian visitor, Andrea) says about his character and that of Adam Neal Smith (starring as Dallas-based Jeff):  ""....they are not attracted to each other.....they don't have sex together.....I don't think they develop a romance.""  WOW! says this viewer.  Just what is the audience to think happens after that extended kissing scene they give us to end a shot.....that when the camera pans away they'll frantically leap out of bed and run to opposite ends of the house from one another?  Yeah, sure.  Then, to further add to the expectations they've been building in us, at film's end we have Andrea extending an  invitation to visit his country.....as all the while the two are moving into a long, body against body, arms around one another, heads on shoulders--eyes closed, farewell embrace.  Such contradictory filmmaker statements about this couple's future together is certainly an unhappy note for we romantics in the audience. But always hopeful, I like to think that perhaps these two actors got together and decided to end run their bosses' intentions in the matter of down-the-road time together by giving a bit more in these two scenes than was scripted.....and that's why we actually saw what we saw (Hurray for our side!).To add to mention of this film's two noteworthy stars, one of the first things which hits us is the almost tangible chemistry between them. We've all heard of strangers meeting and immediately connecting, and here we sit watching an example of that occur. Before our eyes, two actors / characters begin coming together both emotionally and in the interests they share. Even more, as we witness the occasions on which this happens, there's a kind of quiet attraction that begins to pull us right into such scenes with them (thanks, in part, to frequent use of intense closeups).  Speaking of the cinematography, this film, to me, contains camera-work such as you've seldom or likely not seen: extended shots with static or little movement, involving both characters and everyday scenery. This approach seemed to produce strong feelings on this seasoned viewer's part of being intimately (!) drawn into a scene.....into a moment. Yes, there are many slow moving and contemplative times (a complaint of several professional reviewers)......so, if you're looking for fast action, e.g., hot clubbing, heavy-beat music, fast fu--s in the sack, this is not a film for you. However, if you're looking for something concerning the resilience of the human spirit, and hope that the future might bring love to those who've experienced deep loss, then this is a bang-up film for you.It's been a dry two-plus years since 2007's ""Shelter"" and even longer since that great, little French film, ""Just a Question of Love"" (2000).  So, am I disappointed this didn't turn out to be a romance?  You bet I am!  (But it'll still take a place on my ""Addictives Shelf"").PS--What's the bit with the skin tag?  (DVD Commentary has no mention of it, nor of a ""very, very"" long distance phone call. Absolutely no real details on the leads' working together---Film Commenters seem to have no idea what many of us out here would like to be told).",N/A

1306520,"This is the true story: In 19th century, people of Verona indicated a house as the residence of Juliet from William Shakespeare's ""Romeo and Juliet."" Later, in 1937, it became a tradition to go to Juliet's grave in Verona and leave Juliet a letter about one's love problems. In 1990s the amount of letters reached astronomical proportions and a group of volunteers, who call themselves ""Club di Giulietta,"" took it upon themselves to answer each and every letter that's left for Juliet.Enter Hollywood: A young woman named Sophie (played by Amanda Seyfried) on her pre-Honeymoon discovers a letter left unanswered since 1957 and decides to answer it. This sets in motion the entire movie and, lo and behold, the audience is following the film's characters through Italy's countryside in the search for one true love.""Letters to Juliet"" is a cute romantic comedy that has some pretty scenery and captures of Verona, Italy. The movie is rather unrealistic but in a nice, harmless way that makes the most critical of us smile. Although the film never transcends beyond the fairy-tale, it's a sugar-sweet movie that leaves a pleasant feeling.Amanda Seyfried struggles with the responsibility of carrying on a film as a leading lady and Gael Garc&iacute;a Bernal is miscast as the fiance that never has time for Sophie. It's up to the film's elders to make the story compelling and Vanessa Redgrave shines as the woman who wrote Juliet a letter and is moved to search for her long-lost true love after fifty years.",N/A
1297328,"ENDGAME, as written by Paula Milne and directed by Pete Travis, is a thinking person's film.  The subject is the ongoing crises of the Apartheid in South Africa (here during the years 1985 - 1990, with after film commentary to 1999) and the extended secret meetings between the Apartheid regime as controlled by President Botha (Timothy West), those meetings held between the African National Congress represented by Thabo Mbeki (Chiwetel Ejiofor) with prisoner Nelson Mandela (Clarke Peters) as the heart of the blacks and the increasingly disillusioned Afrikaner  Apartheidists lead by Professor Will Esterhuyse (William Hurt)  convened by a British representative Michael Young (Jonny Lee Miller) acting as spokesman for his entrepreneurial boss Rudolf Agnew (Derek Jacobi) of a major British industry vested in South Africa.  The talks are wired by Botha's intelligence officer Dr. Niel Barnard (Mark Strong) and level of intrigue is high.  The message of the film is the struggle and final victory of democracy  and the end of Apartheid in South Africa, and while the cerebral discussions by this fine group of actors is illuminating, the film gains its power from fast shots of the conditions in South Africa at the time, including rioting, terrorist acts, loss of families, and the ever present intrigue and danger surrounding those men attending the secret meetings.The supporting cast (especially John Kani as Oliver Tambo, the venerated life long friend of Mandela) is exceptionally strong, but in the end it is the unexpected fine acting of William Hurt and the always excellent Chiwetel Ejifor who remind us how small scaled dramas can have far more impact than the big epics we are used to enduring.  This film is especially excellent for informing the public about the ins and outs and meanings of the South African Apartheid and why the ending of that evil regime lighted the fuse for so many other important sociologic changes.

828692,"I have never seen a dramatic performance as powerful as that of Nicole Kidman in this film. She portrays Grace Mulligan, who seeks refuge in Dogville, a very small village (fifteen adults, seven children). Dogville is in a remote mountainous pocket of desperate poverty during the Great Depression of the 1930's. It's accessible by only one mountain road. The one radio in town only plays music. No news. It's like Dogville makes up its own shabby little world.Grace is running away from gangsters. She is at the mercy of the townspeople, all of whom know that she is hiding from grave danger. So, she depends on the milk of human kindness.For the most part, Dogville's residents appear to be kind and compassionate toward Grace at first. But that's before they start thinking that Grace just might be the perfect victim...The film reinforces the Hobbesian notion that many do the right thing only because they fear retribution for behaving poorly. So, how do people treat someone who is totally at their mercy? That is, how do people act once they think that there is no possibility of retribution?The production of the film is unique. It's set on a bare-bones stage. People act like they are opening and closing doors; there are no actual doors. Walls are just lines on the floor. The most substantial props are cars and a truck used in a few scenes.Once I got over the unusual staging, I realized that the acting was all that mattered. Kidman's performance is remarkable as Grace comes to learn, the hard way, how cruel people can be. It all builds to a shocking, explosive, conclusion. All of the acting is solid, but, for the most part, the others could just play off of Kidman's work.",N/A
742233,"Okay, just when you thought there could not possibly be any more country folk, urban folk, suburban folk, folk rock, rock folk, semi-folk, or quasi-folk music from the folk revival of the early 1960 to review here I am again reviewing some of the stars of that time-in their dotage. Well, maybe not dotage, but we are all, including Judy Collins, Eric Andersen, Tom Rush, and Arlo Guthrie, getting a little long in the tooth, and no one can dispute that hard fact. The real question is whether the artists in this compilation still have it, at least for those of us in that dwindling, graying, arthritic, prescription-needing folk audience that fills the small church basement ""coffee houses"" on this planet. And they do. Still have it, I mean.That said, this little Wildflower Festival setting in 2003 provided Judy and her guests with a chance to show their stuff, new and old. Now, for those who have heard Judy Collins sing back in the day the question is why she did not challenge Joan Baez for the ""queen"" of folk title. She had the voice, the style, and the looks (ya, that WAS important, even then) to do so. I have been running a ""Not Joan Baez"" series and will deal with that question there at some other time but her work here is pretty good, especially her well-known cover of Ian Tyson's ""Someday Soon"".

Produced as a spin-off fromAnne of Green Gables(another of my favorites), this series was unique in the sense that it accorded equal time to both the children and adults residing in the town of Avonlea on Prince Edward Island. The earlier season focused a lot on the antics of the children as they interfered in the affairs of the adults, often with hilarious and at times poignant results. The latter season saw these children maturing and undergoing adolescent pangs, as they struggled to cope with emotions and events as they grew up.Season 5 begins with the episode, ""Fathers and Sons"", one of the highlights of the season and also one that is bittersweet. Alec King (Cedric Smith) places heavy demands on his young son, Felix (Zachary Bennett)who is to inherit the King farm someday. Felix on the other hand has no real interest in the farm, preferring to work at the White Sands Hotel and dreams of opening his own Tea Room someday. This predictably does not go down well with Alex who takes pride in adhering to family traditions, but slowly comes to the realization that Felix needs to be able to have a dream of his own, and perhaps traditions can be changed.

1105974,"Being a fan of Ludlum's ""Bourne"" books, I was eagerly anticipating the first film of the series to see how exactly Doug Liman and writer Tony Gilroy were going to adapt the anti-hero to a more modern setting. Taking it from the jungles of Vietnam and the pursuit of Carlos the Jackal, and making it into a high-speed, high-intensity techno-thriller that is quite literally about identity was no small feat. And also making it a really intelligent, extremely well-acted actioner was a task that Liman, Gilroy, and Damon were able to pull off quite well. THE BOURNE IDENTITY set us up for everything that was to come: a very independent attitude brought to the Hollywood style of filmmaking; a great cast of indie players, like Chris Cooper, Franka Potente, Julia Stiles, Brian Cox and Clive Owen; a refreshing approach to the immediacy and improvisation of hand-to-hand combat; it's a near-perfect modernization of the tale of Jason Bourne.THE BOURNE SUPREMACY took that even further. With director Paul Greengrass coming in, who, instead of opting for Liman's more distanced approach to the action which is more appropriate for a Hollywood film, took us directly into the action. With fast cuts, shaky camera shots, and use of sound so that we no longer seem like we're watching the combat, but actually a participant in it, Greengrass (and returning writer Gilroy) sets a slightly different tone, and heightens the intensity that much more. And with the additions of Joan Allen and Karl Urban and Martin Csokas, and keeping Cox, Stiles, Potente and Cooper, Greengrass knows how to do it right. This is most certainly not a film for purists of the Bourne books because this film perhaps has more deviations than the other films from the book's plot points, but it keeps with the main plot, which is the Bourne impostor designed to bring Bourne out in the open. Also Greengrass seems to have more of a handle on bringing a more intense and more personal tale out of the character of Jason Bourne than Liman did, but that also may be a luxury of doing a sequel as well.THE BOURNE ULTIMATUM is the ultimate icing on the cake of this series, and is quite simply the best film of the series. Greengrass comes back onboard, with Gilroy in tow as well, and they bring actors like Paddy Considine, Scott Glenn, Albert Finney and the always-great David Strathairn to round it out. The film is ingenious in many ways, most specifically how it ties this film to SUPREMACY, because scenes that we saw in the previous film reappear in this one in very, very suprising ways. But Greengrass ups the ante once again, and brings Bourne full circle to where it all began. And again, Greengrass never lets up on the viewer for a second once the intrigue and the action and the suspense begin. He lets those moments build to a full boil, and just when you think you can't take it anymore, he goes for the kill.It's obvious the mark that the BOURNE films have left on the contemporary spy thriller. If you watch the Bond film QUANTUM OF SOLACE, it seems like there are literally entire scenes stolen from the BOURNE films. Unfortunately that didn't help that film. But fortunately, if it can help to reshape the genre of the spy thriller and bring it in a new and more vital direction, with less emphasis on gadgetry and more on character while keeping the globe-trotting action and suspense, then it makes the BOURNE TRILOGY all that much better.",The Jason Bourne Collection (The Bourne Identity / The Bourne Supremacy / The Bourne Ultimatum)
1070375,"... and before the 'magic flute' there was the 'magic book' that the beneficent magus Oromases presents to the hero Zoroastre in Jean-Philippe Rameau's boldly ""Masonic"" opera of 1749, composed decades before Mozart's Zauberflute. There's no clear evidence whether Rameau himself was a Freemason or not, but his librettist Louis de Cahusac unquestionably was, and a highly placed one. His libretto for this innovative 'tragedie lyrique' is an eloquent declaration of Enlightenment/Masonic humanism -- anti-clerical, optimistic about the potentials of humanity and society, a paean to Universal Harmony and the triumph of Light/Wisdom over Darkness/Superstition. There's not a speck of Christianity in the libretto, a fact that must have outraged more than a few people in the ancien regime. The humanistic philosophy expounded in Rameau's opera is far more explicit and radical than that of Mozart's glorious goofiness.But the comparison extends beyond literary themes. It's a matter of musical genius, also. Let me place my cards on the table: this is a great opera, one of the greatest of the 18th C, and of course the 18th C was the greatest century of musical history. (Go ahead, call my bluff if you dare!) If you're distracted for the briefest moment while watching/hearing this performance, it can only be because you fail to`grok' the music fully ...... but I'm realistic enough to know that French baroque is a cultivated taste, just as much as an appreciation of ripe cheeses or goose-liver pat&eacute;s. France took its own route through the baroque. French opera is ineluctably different from the conventions of Italian opera that prevailed eveywhere else, from Monteverdi to Mozart. Rameau (1683-1764) was an exact contemporary of Handel (1685-1759), the greatest of Italian opera composers, by the way. Whereas Italian opera was constructed as a series of recitations -- narratives that advanced the dramamtic (in)action -- alternating with da capo arias expressing vague universal themes, French opera was far closer to through-composed `verismo'. The distinction between recitativo and aria is minimal. French opera always included extended instrumental ballet passages, rare in Italian. Whereas the thrills of Italian opera are to be heard in the pyrotechnic displays of arpeggiated fast notes, in French opera the pleasures are in the `graces' and embellishments, in the sensuous affect with which the words are expressed. A manuscript of French baroque (not a modern edited score!) shows a myriad of squiggles over nearly every note. Italian composers wrote about the ""hurla francese"", the howls and shouts favored by French singers, and you will hear a lot of such impetuous vocalizing in thsi performance. Singing French baroque opera is a different art from singing Mozart or Rossini, let alone Verdi or Puccini. It requires very specific historically-informed training and complete dedication to the French manner. Even the finest romantic opera singers are not equipped physically to sing Rameau or Lully. Placido Domingo, for instance, could no sooner sing the role of Zoroastre artfully, or the superb Wagnerian Waltraud Meier sing the role of Amelite in this opera, than Sarah Palin could conduct American foreign policy without debacle. Likewise, modern orchestral instruments have no business attempting French baroque, and fortunately by and large they don't. The orchestra on this DVD combines the strings of Les Talens Lyriques with some of the winds of the Drottningholm Theater Orchestra, all `original' instruments at authentic baroque pitch. The timbres they produce are magnificent.It's the singers, however, that matter most. All eight principals in this performance are superbly trained HIP specialists, and all meet the demands of their roles. The most luscious plum of a role goes to the anti-heroine Erinice, the wicked sister who is in love with Zoroastre but who conspires with his evil rival for the throne, Abramane. Erinice has the wildest shifts of affect to express from rage to adoration, despair to pride; Anna Maria Panzarella covers the whole spectrum. Amelite, sung by Sine Bundgaard, is a simpler figure; her task is to be lovely and pure, a vocal embodiment of the Light to dawn when Zoroastre rules. Zoroastre, sung handsomely by the handsome Andres Dahlin, is likewise more an icon of Virtue than a decisive hero; his eventual victory depends more on his spiritual backer, Oromases, sung by Gerard Theruel, than on his own prowess. His opposite, the demonic and demented personification of Darkness Abramane, is sung vigorously by Evgueniy Alexiev; just as in Milton's ""Paradise Lost"", the villian in Rameau's opera is far more vivid than the hero. Basso Lars Arvidson, comes close to stealing the show in the two roles of Zopire and Vengeance, the arch-diabolical cohorts of Abramane. Perhaps the best-known singer in the cast is soprano Ditte Andersen, in the secondary role of Amelite's maid Cephie. Andersen is such a superb singer that she also comes close to upstaging her mistress.You'll notice from their names that this is an international cast. One previous reviewer, who didn't like the production as much as I do, complained about the singers' mispronunciation of the French text. He charged the male singers with being worse than the females. Frankly, I find his comments specious. The most `charmingly' Scandinavian vowels are those of Ditte Andersen, while Anna Maria Panzarella gives us Italian consonants throughout. My own French isn't perfect, but honestly I could understand the libretto most of the time without subtitles, particulary when sung by the two male principals. In any case, Louis de Cahusac didn't speak modern academy French! His libretto was written before the ""great vowel shift"" that followed the French Revolution. The language spoken in aristocratic circles of the ancien regime sounded as little like modern Parisian as a South Carolina drawl sounds like Australian.The singers do NOT attempt an authentic 18th C pronunciation -- thank goodness -- but in every other way this performance is painstakingly HIP to the ears, original instruments matched with authentic vocal technique. What is presented to the eyes is the diametrical opposite, a relentlessly ""modern"" staging in terms of dramaturgy, cinematography, and choreography. And it's Modern despite being produced on the only unmodified late 18th C stage in the world, that of the Queen's Palace outside Stockholm. Even the stage machinery there is still authentic, the painted wings and clouds are still moved by windlasses turned by human arms.I can't promise that everyone will be satisfied by the visuals. I can imagine that some aficcionados of baroque opera would prefer a `recreation' of a performance in the costumes and with the gestures of 1749. There's a lot of writhing and grimacing in the dramaturgy, as well as some extraneous jerrywork with the camera. I was least persuaded by the choreography, which I found visually short of the sensual grace that a baroque audience would have demanded. Nevertheless, the staging has the significant virtue of being consistent with the music and the text. There's nothing incongruous, distracting, or contrary about it, and that amounts to high praise in the current world of opera productions.Purely in terms of compositional brilliance, Zoroastre is the most impressive of the several Rameau operas available on DVD -- Les Boreades, Les Indes Galantes, Les Paladins, Platee, Castor et Pollux -- and for that reason it would be the first I'd recommend as an introduction to the genre. The others are all extraordinary, too, with gorgeous singing and imaginative staging, but Zoroastre approaches closest to the foundational ideal of Opera as a synthesis of music, language, and thought.The DVD includes an hour-long documentary, on the second disk, titled ""Discovering an Opera"". It's well worth watching, even for experienced lovers of French baroque. For neophytes, I might even recommend watching it first. Musical director/conductor Christophe Rousset deserves a very large share of the credit for the quality of this performance, and it's exciting to hear his thoughts about the French style while watching him rehearse some of the singers in details thereof. Stage director Pierre Audi also makes a good case for his modernistic dramaturgy.",Rameau - Zoroastre
1245875,". . . and best werewolf and best ghost show on TV.  Mind you, I like TRUE BLOOD and have even come to see the upside to THE VAMPIRE DIARIES, but both of those are enjoyable diversions with no real subtext (TRUE BLOOD gestures at subtext with its parallels with prejudice against all kinds of difference, but in 2010 that is a pretty worked over subtext and lacks power at this point).  But if you want more depth of subtext and a more subtle narrative and richer character development and, well, less garishness, than this is a show you should check out.  Not yet available in the U.S. on DVD and Blu-ray (every time I have checked on Amazon I've only seen an outrageously overpriced $70 Blu-ray that never seems to be available -- though if you have an all regions DVD player, you can order an infinitely more affordable edition from Great Britain, which I strongly recommend, I repeat, only if you have an All-Regions player).  There are only six episodes in Season One and eight in Seasons Two, so the idea of paying over $10 per episode is rather offensive.  But you can either catch the show on BBC America or on Region 2 DVDs.The series starts when two orderlies at a hospital at Bristol decide to room together.  What makes this desirable for them is that they are supernatural creatures.  Mitchell is a vampire.  Not a terribly old one by vampire narrative standards (less than a century old).  George is a werewolf and on three nights a week has a rather violent transformation into a truly nasty beastie (and thanks to CGI his transformations are truly horrendous).  Both of them are trying to pass as normal humans, and for economic reasons and simply because they don't want to live alone, they decide to find an apartment together.  By happy circumstance, the apartment they find and move into is inhabited by an outrageously sunny and upbeat ghost named Annie.  Together, the three of them try to lives that are as normal as possible.The trouble is, the rest of the world doesn't want them to live normal lives.  The vampire community (why does there always seem to be a vampire community?) wants Mitchell to return to the fold.  They especially don't want him living with a werewolf.  And meanwhile, the afterlife wants Annie to move on, into the light, and away from her human life.  So their struggles are unusually rich and complex.What made BUFFY and ANGEL so vastly superior to TRUE BLOOD and MOONLIGHT and THE VAMPIRE DIARIES and the TWILIGHT series (both novels and movies) was what they were able to do with the premises, with the metaphorical richness of the stories.  TRUE BLOOD ends up being a glorious one-dimensional guilty pleasure show, all glorious surface with nothing beneath.  BEING HUMAN is much more like BUFFY, with richly developed, deliciously articulated stories with timely cultural references.  Mitchell's vampirism, for instance, is used less as a metaphor for homosexuality, as it is in TRUE BLOOD, but addiction and the difficulty of human self-control.The show is driven by its appealing leads.  Russell Tovey (George) will be perhaps best known from his appearance on DR. WHO and the movie THE HISTORY BOYS, but Lenora Crichlow (Annie) and Aidan Turner (Mitchell) are appealing newcomers.  There are endless polls about who the hottest vampires are and if Mitchell were better known in the U.S. he'd almost certainly win them all.  He is a spectacular incarnation of the really bad boy who wants to be good but for whom it is a constant struggle.  George, meanwhile, is like the big silly family dog.  There is meanwhile absolutely noting ghostly about Annie except that she can't be seen.  She is dark complexioned, but if you had to assign a color to her personality, it would be yellow.  Bright yellow.  She is sunny and irrepressibly happy and upbeat.  Any room she is in has no dark corners.  In other words, the polar opposite of all of the stereotypes of ghosts.SyFy has announced that they are developing an American version of BEING HUMAN.  Hopefully they won't blow it.  The BBC series is a great one.  I am not opposed to an American version, as long as it is more like the American adaptations of THE OFFICE than other efforts.  But even if it fails, it should be seen as a gesture towards the excellence of the original.  But even if the American version turns out well, if you love extremely high quality shows dealing with the supernatural, you should definitely know the original.  The only thing I hate about this show is that there have been only fourteen episodes to date.",N/A

According to the series, there were quite a few different species of such early hominids  - close to the missing link - until 1.5 million years ago when rapid climate fluctuations required the primates to adapt or die..and that meant ""bigger brains.""For anyone interested in paleoanthropology - this series is a MUST SEE.

Their Beat music was a blast, but when ""Don't Let The Sun Catch You Crying"" and ""Ferry Cross The Mersey"" haunted the radios, it stopped you in a trance. Gerry's great voice was destined for moody ballads with graceful builds. Panoramic but personal. No wonder his cover of ""You'll Never Walk Alone"" became a stadium anthem moving global crowds to this day.But Gerry Marsden also rocked and this terrific disc proves it. The energy and melodies of ""I'm The One"" and ""It's Gonna Be Alright"" are as contagious as anything from ""A Hard Day's Night"". His astute taste in American platters sparkles through ""A Shot of Rhythm and Blues"", ""Dizzy Miss Lizzy"", and ""Skinny Minnie"". And of course Merseybeat faves like ""How Do You Do It?"" and ""I Like It"" are here to shine. A special revelation is the rollicking piano of amiable Les McGuire, putting the roll into all that rocking.Between clips the personable and funny Marsden quips anecdotes about early British rock, the Reeperbahn scene, The Beatles, and the Mersey explosion. Also, Liverpool music scholar Bill Harry gives us the big picture. Gerry caps it off with a 2009 solo performance of ""Ferry Cross The Mersey"" at the Cavern Club that tops the disc like a cherry on ice cream.",N/A

1249569,"OK, I watched this film only because I am a Robert Parker fan. Wowser- I really enjoyed it. Who'd a thunk that Tom Selleck could really steal the show?  He is the antithesis of what I would think of as a Parker man. But, oh, how wrong I was.Selleck or Jesse as he likes to be known, has come to Paradise, Massachusetts after a tough time in California. He comes to this small town and becomes their sheriff. Paradise, as it turns out, is a place that attracts crime. This time a mother comes looking for her missing son. He was born seven years ago and taken the day of his birth. She is sure he is still alive, and someone sent her a note saying 'your son is loved'. Jesse is not keen on taking up this case but one of his staff, played by Kathy Baker, takes it on, on her own time. The town fathers are not happy with Jesse, not enough speeding tickets, so his job is on the line. He is helping a fellow cop, chief of the state's homicide bureau, when both are shot. This is another mystery to undertake. But, it seems Jesse is up to all challenges, and he meets them head on.A lot of humor, some implied sex, danger, and the city of Boston is featured.

Slow moving, a little flat, but tolerable. Instead of moving things to a new level, New Moon wallows in the same somber material that was in the first film. But this time, girls, there are boys with no shirts = werewolves! How exciting? No, not really -  especially when there is so much maudlin dialog spread throughout this film.I have to give credit to the marketing people and the producers. They managed to create something that can directly tap into the pre-teen, teen female movie-goer. Guys know, sensitivity is a hard thing to fake, but if you fake it well then you, just like this film,  will be real popular with the ladies. The romantic mythology of this age group is a very powerful thing and this film carefully harnesses that energy, generating massive ticket sales.But is the film deserving of such attention?

1370194,"It doesn't take strong observance to see after watching a few minutes of this that this was a personal journey for Corbin Bernsen.  His busy r&eacute;sum&eacute; came to an interesting pause here as he took the writer's, directors, and co-producer's chair for this, and despite a slow start, I gradually become deeply engrossed as the film progressed.  I love movies with character growth and flavor which slowly marinates the heart, and considering many of the acting projects he has done in the past, this was really refreshing.  I don't think it will grab audiences in droves as the Kendricks' films (Fireproof, Facing The Giants).  However, this is nevertheless very touching, inspirational, and profound.  Although there is not a huge amount of characters who are involved in the fire mystery, which is the big subplot, you still need to pay close attention to the dialogue which reveals subtle pieces of information along the way.  James Moore (Corbin's character) is of course the center of the whole film, and every scene (either purely scenic or dialogue driven) is an emotional step along his path back to where he should be in his relationship with God.Corbin's real father passing in 2008 inspired him to take on this project, and knowing that piece of information going in makes viewing this even more inspirational.

823202,"A&E;'s release of what they call the surviving 5 episodes of the BBC-produced 1960s color Sherlock Holmes starring Peter Cushing is odd for several reasons.  The first is that A&E; released it on DVD instead of the BBC themselves, through their BBC/2Entertain branded DVD line.  Secondly, the package actually contains SIX 50 minute episodes, since The Hound of the Baskervilles is a two-parter.  The episodes themselves are characteristic of BBC video/film productions of the time, with the inherent occasional video dropouts and abrupt cutting between video and film shots.  Frankly, they look far better than I expected given the BBC's usual treatment of its old programs.Regarding the performances: Peter Cushing was, by all reports, a polite and gentlemanly man--as is his Holmes.  If you are looking for the abrupt and occasionally impatient man of action found in the Doyle canon, you will be disappointed.  This Holmes is so well-mannered and neat that you cannot imagine him falling victim to the lackadaisical debauchery of a consulting detective between cases.  The very idea of this dapper and upright Holmes mixing a 7% solution for his needle is laughable.  Cushing's gentlemanly portrayal is always enjoyable, if occasionally silly.  One particular scene springs to mind where he is handed a series of objects to examine and politely thanks the giver after receiving each and every one.  Nigel Stock's portrayal of Dr. Watson can best be understood if we imagine a line graph where Basil Rathbone's crony Nigel Bruce represents the bumbling end and Jeremy Brett's David Burke/Edward Hardwicke represent the serious end.  Stock falls precisely in the middle.  His Watson is occasionally bumbling and played for comic effect (in four out of six episodes) and serious and brave (in the two-part Hound of the Baskervilles).  As with Cushing's performance, Stock is relentlessly likeable.What else to say?  As with many versions of Holmes, these adventures contain enough burning tobacco to make even the viewer sick from secondhand smoke.  Perhaps that was why London was so darn foggy back then.  But I digress.  The episodes have the occasional awkward moments and unusual directorial choices--probably a result of limited budgets.  Almost everyone knows the point in Hound of the Baskervilles where a lamp in an upstairs window signals to someone across the darkened moor.  This is the only production to my knowledge that does not even show the other person signaling back.  The characters just claim he is and look off screen.  You could almost imagine a BBC accountant punching an old fashioned adding machine and tut-tutting ""No--You can't show a light on the moor.  It'll cost an extra 80 quid for the process shot!""  Another instance has Holmes and Watson, obviously garbed for the 1890s, trailing a clue along what very much appears to be a 1960s street.  Did they really use window treatments like that in the 19th century?  But I digress again.The sole extra is an episode of A&E;'s Biography of Sherlock Holmes minus the Biography credits.  I guess A&E; couldn't get the rights to their own credits (perhaps they belong to BBC video--okay, maybe not).  In any case, the episode is filled with common facts about Holmes, yet remains fun for the sequences where David Burke reprises his Watson character to attend a dinner with the London Sherlock Holmes Society.  The head of the society makes a nice speech admitting Holmes is not real and then turns things over to his real but fictional guest Dr. Watson.  Do not think about the proceeding too long or your head will hurt.The episodes are largely faithful to the stories and the series is constantly enjoyable viewing.  The above caveats and deprecations aside, I give it 4 out of 5 stars.  Highly recommended!",N/A
1329656,"Also known by the title Murder World, this straight-to-video vampire flick offers a few reasons to make it fairly watchable.  Most notably the beautiful English-Australian pop singer/model/actress Sophie Monk(The Hills Run Red).  She's definitely not your average creature of the night.Brooke and Rhea are a nice young lesbian couple that committed an inconceivable murder at a party back in the 60's.  Instead of being punished, God (a female God btw) decides to recruit them as her tool for destroying evil.  So 40 years later (I guess God is a great procrastinator) these ladies are sent back to Earth as blood-sucking vampire zombie angel lesbians.  Yee-haw.This twist to the genre doesn't make a whole lot of sense, but at least it's something different.  The two fangless femme fatales wander around the desert in their underwear and start a vicious killing spree.  There is a touch of humor and some decent gore effects, but nothing special.  Plus some people might enjoy the moments of gratuitous nudity from the backup actresses.I do feel like the concept of punishing evildoers wasn't developed near enough.  The story essentially consists of one lady vampire killing random people while her partner is conflicted with the senseless violence, despite God's orders.  Anyway, this mission did seem to lack any real purpose.  Why couldn't these sexy bloodsuckers go after terrorists, pedophiles, drug dealers and other scumbags?  There is absolutely no justice in this world.I was surprised by the abrupt ending, which seemed way too rushed.  Anyway, this isn't a complete waste.

1278634,"I find it strange to think about how many years it's been since the (American) release of Last Exile.  As much of a groundbreaking series as that was, it was only natural that I would jump at the opportunity to experience the latest masterpiece created by my favorite animation studio and Director.  From successes like Romeo X Juliet, Gankutsuou: The Count of Monte Cristo, Kaze No Stigma, and Chrono Crusade it isn't a surprise that this studio can just kick these things out left and right.Although, I must admit that the concept that went into the Tower of Druaga was quite different than what I've come to expect from them.  A unique style of animation was used to create a very serious story based on the Gilgamesh Mythos while at the same exact time making it extremely hilarious (especially to those who've experienced those old 1980s and 1990s Japanese Role-Playing Games).  At times I found it quite difficult to figure out whether I was supposed to be laughing of deeply interested in what would happen next.I understand that this is a story that is based on a Video Game series by Bandai/Naamco, for which I never played.  However, after this first of two part series, I have come to become quite interested in finding out if the game really does follow the story of Jil (Main Character) and if he really is that absent minded (at times).This was a very deep series and worth the effort to see just once (I especially like the fact that they have two pilot episodes which quite beautifully capture the more comical side as well as more serious plot-line.However, I have always been a fan of GONZO DIGIMATION since I was introduced to it via Last Exile.Oh, and the soundtrack for this series is absolutely gorgeous!

775474,"I'm kind of surprised after watching ""Suicide Club"" I actually didn't intend to at first. I saw the clip of the subway train jumping on the net like years ago and wondered where it was from but never cared to watch the movie. Some years later I check out a movie called Noriko's Dinner Table and this movie is referenced throughout it well the primary incident at least. I thought Noriko's Dinner table was pretty good strange but good so I thought I'd give this a try.After reading reviews about how people were disappointed at Noriko's Dinner table for not being a direct sequel I honestly don't get why. Compared to the 2 Noriko's dinner table was by far a better movie because it was complete,quirky,deep, and entertaining. I expected the same when I watch suicide club but what could have been a great film just turned into a waste of time.The first half of the movie starts off like a great film. Your genuinely interested in seeing what happens and solving the mystery. The film starts out with a group of girls jumping onto a railway. Probably what makes this movie famous and so talked about...then it has some odd occurrences with people killing themselves. The story has 3 main characters. 1. The cop, 2. The cute girl on the cover, and 3. The hacker chick. I only call them main characters because the events that happen to them are all turning points in the story. You start out following the cop which is by far the best part of this movie. **maybe spoiler nah not really** Something happens to him and the movie you were just watching ends right there. All of a sudden Suicide Club turns into a musical. This movie goes from Suspenseful horror to ""is this a joke?"" quick! Norkio's Dinner table had that same eerie yet goofy atmosphere but it had it throughout the movie. It didn't all of a sudden turn into a completely different movie half way through it.The moment the rock star starts singing you can consider this film over. The movie killed it's own self. From there you jump to the 2nd Main Character the Hacker and for some reason you never know what becomes of her character. It's just like the writers forgot to finish her story. Then from there we go back to the cute girl on the cover. Who solves the mystery of Suicide Club then the movie gets even weirder then it just ends with another  lame song. I honestly thought people where killing themselves because they had to listen to that horrible ""Dessert"" Pop group and that freaking song ""call me"" that stuck in my freaking head! MAKE IT STOP! MAKE IT STOP! ""CALL ME DA DA DA DA DA DA"" ""MAIL ME DA DA DA DA DA!"" some one kill me!Ahhhhh.... ok what was I saying now... That's right, I don't understand what the message was or what the point of this film was. I really don't get what this movie was trying to be. Noriko's Dinner Table said more about the suicide Club and what it was more than the movie ""Suicide Club"" only that in Noriko's Dinner table no one physically killed them selves they mentally killed themselves by acting as another person until they no longer could connect with who they once were. That and some other stuff it was a really good film. Suicide Club is just outright confusing. Once the 1st main character is out the scene the movie turns into something else that I wasn't interested in watching honestly.I give this move 3 stars for the first half of it. It's too unique to give it less than that really (first half only other half is a POS!). The rest of the movie can kiss the Dvd case... not worth your time to watch.",Suicide Club

I really enjoyed the dancers and some even interact with the bands on stage.The picture itself is sharp and clean, and looks great. There's one issue that I have though and it's with some of the shots during the slower tempo songs. The camera uses some sort of filter on the lens so that the surrounding image is blurred. It's like looking through a doughnut hole with the image clear on the inside and blurry on the out, but fortunately that effect is kept to a minimum.At the end of the concert, all of the acts gather on stage to sing a song; the perfect ending to a brilliant movie/concert.=====  EXTRAS  =====* Commentary by Director Steve Binder and music historian Don Waller* 4-Radio Spots-Just audio and no ""play all"" feature.

Maybe in comparison to Latter Days it has a bit more the feeling of low budget movie, but it's not something that weight too much on the quality. It has the merit to show what it can be the life in a small town for a gay boy; when you feel alone in your same home, maybe friendship could be mistaken for love, and when you are forced apart from that love, it becomes more perfect than what it really was.",Kiss the Bride
1337059,"This is another fine Foriegn film out of Sweden that is right up there with ""The Girl With The Dragon Tatoo"". Based on actual Swedish history, this film has an excellent story line and great acting. This is actually the second part of two flims done on this Story, as far as I can tell, the first part never made it to the United States and it actually featured the Lead Actor as the young Arn and tells the back story of what lead up to his coming to the Monks at the Monestary as a young boy. I would not have known about the first film had I not watched the behind the scenes feature that was included on the DVD/Blu-ray disc. If that film ever became available here in the United States I would buy it. Although I was not familar with Joakim Natterqvist (the lead Actor) it was the Story itself that caught my eye. There is one international Swedish film star in the movie however that I believe most people would know, Stellan Skarsgard (of ""Mama Mia"" fame)and the father of Eric Skarsgard of ""True Blood"". If you are into history as I am, I would highly recommend this film. It is both worth watching and owning.RICHARD",N/A
1241805,"""Edge Of Darkness"" is excellent! This is how the story goes: Thomas Craven is a veteran homicide detective for the Boston Police Department and a single father. When his only child, 24-year-old Emma, is murdered on the steps of his home, everyone assumes that he was the target. But he soon suspects otherwise, and embarks on a mission to find out about his daughter's secret life and her killing. His investigation leads him into a dangerous looking-glass world of corporate cover-ups, government collusion and murder -- and to shadowy government operative Darius Jedburgh who has been sent in to clean up the evidence. Craven's solitary search for answers about his daughter's death transforms into an odyssey of emotional discovery and redemption.The cast led by Mel Gibson (in an excellent performance as Thomas Craven) is excellent! The directing by Martin Campbell (who also directed the original British mini-series of ""Edge Of Darkness"" (1985), he also directed ""Casino Royale"" (2006), ""GoldenEye"" (1995), ""The Mask Of Zorro"" (1998), ""The Legend Of Zorro"" (2005), ""Vertical Limit"" (2000) & the upcoming ""Green Lantern"" (2011) is excellent!

109204,"Of all the mysteries written by Agatha Christie, none surpasses the real-life one in which she was involved. In 1926, just after the publication of her novel, THE MURDER OF ROGER ACKROYD, the newly-famous author walked out of her life and disappeared, and the search for her created worldwide headlines. She was found 11 days later, in a health spa on the other side of England, registered under an assumed name--the name of her husband's mistress. She never explained the incident, not even in her eventual autobiography. British author Kathleen Tynan published the book, AGATHA, shortly after Christie's death in 1976, and in 1979 director Michael Apted (7-UP, GORKY PARK, GORILLAS IN THE MIST) brought the film version to the screen.Though we'll never really know the truth behind those 11 days in 1926, this speculative drama offers one possible explanation, and it's fascinating. Vanessa Redgrave is superb in the title role of the troubled, publicity-shy genius, and Dustin Hoffman--cast against type--offers an interesting portrait of the brash, self-promoting American journalist who tracked her down when even Scotland Yard was at a loss. Needless to say, these two polar opposites find themselves attracted to each other. The period details are vividly realized, the tentative romance between the two leads is touching, and the film creates an aura of glamorous suspense not unlike Christie's own stories. Though not a great film, this is a good one, and a rare opportunity to see two of our finest actors together. A must for fans of Agatha Christie.",N/A
505420,"Dolly Parton stars in ""Unlikely Angel"" which originally aired on CBS in December, 1996. It was her second Holiday telefim, the first being ABC's ""A Smoky Mountain Christmas"" that aired in 1986. In this outing Dolly plays a selfish, unforgiving bar singer who winds up dead in a car crash. In order to get her angel wings and receive entrance into Heaven she must return to earth and help out a family during the Holidays. The family is very dysfunctional as the two children have no mother, are too busy playing video games and watching soap operas, and the father is caught up running his business rather than care for his kids. It's up to Dolly to pull this clan together before she can be with God.""Unlikely Angel"" is a remarkably good made-for-TV movie, even better than Dolly's first Christmas film. The script is strong and the performances are wonderful, especially Dolly and the great Roddy McDowall who plays St. Peter. This would be Roddy's final performance before his death.The movie also features two new Dolly-written compositions, ""Unlikely Angel"" and ""Whatcha Tryin' To Do To Me?"". Unfortunately, Dolly has never recorded those for commercial release, yet are two of her best Holiday songs.Dolly has done many Holiday-themed projects in her career besides ""Unlikely Angel"" and ""A Smoky Mountain Christmas"" (the later of which has only been released in the U.S. via VHS and Asia through DVD only). She starred with Kenny Rogers in the blockbuster ""A Christmas To Remember"" on CBS in 1984 and she had her own solo Christmas special in 1990 called ""Home For Christmas"" on ABC that starred her family. Both specials have never seen a DVD release, but there are many copies recorded from TV airings floating around the internet.An interesting sidenote: Dolly actually suffered from bruises while doing this movie.

481596,"My first exposure to this exposure was in my teens when a male friend and I went to a drive-in movie. We were similar in that our breast experience was limited to suckling at our mother's breasts or accidental encounters with a bare female relative. Therefore, we were both big-time gaga over the ""bigtime"" gaga's that appeared so often on the screen. Every possible excuse (and many times without one) is used to fix the camera on Chesty's massive mammary glands. In our teens, we used to joke about girls that could be dangerous if they spun around quickly, but with Chesty it may not all be a joke. She is huge and saggy.Other than that, this movie has practically nothing going for it, the plot is slow, dull, and it meanders back and forth from plot movement to breast movement. It is difficult to determine which is worse, the acting or the dialog. Fundamentally, Chesty's boyfriend is killed by mobsters, so after a good soaking of her bare breasts by her tears she vows to seek revenge. She then tracks them down one-by-one and kills them by smothering them with her bare breasts.

1227150,"Being an admirer of Jane Austen novels, I was fully prepared NOT to like this movie, but I was thoroughly fascinated by it.  Amanda Price, a present day young woman, fantasizes about the gentler time described in the novel, which she she has read many times, and gets her chance to go into the world of Regency England.  She switches places with Elizabeth Bennett and events start going wrong immediately for Ms Price.In essence, the movie turns the story on its ear.  Characters from the novel are not acting as Ms Price knows they should, and she tries to set things aright--with very limited success.  We learn that Austen had somewhat misjudged some of the characters, Wickam in particular.  All that adds to the enjoyment.Meanwhile, we keep wondering how Elizabeth is doing in 21st century London.  What we eventually learn of that comes as an enormous surprise.  In fact, there are many surprises in this lush production.  It was three hours long, and I hoped for another three hours of it.",N/A
101562,"A former principal once said (in utter irony) that teachers would like to ""teach the best and shoot the rest,"" but that was not going to happen (teaching only the best and shooting the rest). Basically, that idea is the premise of ""187,"" a term referring to the on-air police code for ""dead.""Early in the movie, when Samuel L. Jackson's character Trevor Garfield is stabbed repeatedly in the back after warning his principal that this very act was going to happen, the viewer viscerally understands a teacher's stultifying fear in an urban school when there is no support. Garfield does not die physically, but something inside him does. Not his will power, it thrives. Not his machismo, it heightens. Not his desire to teach, but a piece of it breaks off to become dark and malignant. Not his compassion, but it forks into something normal and something twisted. A vicious act, not just on Garfield's person, but also on his choice of how to value and direct his life, chips away some of his humanity.After a more than year-long recovery Garfield traverses a continent away from New York to settle in California and begin substitute teaching. His assignment? Where else but in a ""temporary"" building subject to gang-banger violence and mayhem. On his first day he is dealt a threat by an police-ankle-bracelet-wearing gang-banger.  Of course, there is the requisite confrontation between the two, setting up inevitable violence. Deja vu!Then there's the stereotypical teen girl with a heart of gold who hands out her ""favors"" as if she is passing out candy. Garfield determines to look after and encourage her as a person of worth. Two other stereotypes flank Garfield: the innocent young teacher (Kelly Rowan)  with idealism in her eyes and heart and the jaundiced, veteran teacher (John Heard)  who's in it ""for the paycheck."" Garfield stands in between: realistic in experience, idealistic in hope.Yet gang-bangers just won't let him be. Remember that dark and growing malignancy in his heart? What will he do with it? Does he become a victim of his environment like Gonzalez or does he overcome it?This film shows evil committed by evil people. Or is that the point? Is this about one good teacher opposed by a bunch of lowlife gang-bangers set on destruction, violence, ruination, rape? The film subtly suggests that evil is not committed by choice but caused by the traps of society at large and urban decay in particular. It's a short moment, but a veritable revelation when Clifton Gonzalez Gonzalez's gang-banger character excretes his defense for his violent acts. Gonzalez duly impresses with his excellent portrayal of a young man doomed not by his environment, but by his own inability to defy the prison that is his environment.Although the story is set in California, the land of the strange allows students such ridiculous freedoms as wearing ""wife-beater"" undershirts, chains as belts, open smoking on campus, including that illegal reefer, unsupervised areas where true ""gang-banging"" takes place with this young girl with no self-esteem, and sets up an environment of too much freedom,  which allows, even encourages disrespect. The school in New York was no different.This dark film, ""187,"" is not for the weak of heart. It makes crystal clear just how much  violence can impact a person in a given situation. How does a dedicated teacher escape attacks by equally dedicated gang-bangers? Is there a way to halt escalating violence once it begins? Is there a solution? This film proffers one view, that of Director Kevin Reynolds and Writer Scott Yagemann. The end credit attributes the script to a teacher.Despite the stereotyping of all the major characters, the movie works, mainly because of the consummate acting all around and credibility. Can such a story happen? I think so. Can men come to such a momentous act? Absolutely. Can they back down, given the circumstances? Yes, but not likely, not with all the existing factors in play.""187""--powerful, provocative, profound, deadly.",N/A
938444,"I have listened to this and other operas with 5.1/7.1 surround sound for about 5 years now and I consider this Blu Ray a reference recording.If you have 6 decent loudspeakers set up properly, you will feel you are at the performance. The soundstage is very wide and curved, for instance you will hear the flutes and clarinets halfway between the left front and the left surround speakers, yet still separated from each other. All instruments are clearly located and you feel like sitting in the middle seat of row 4.The voices are all recorded clear as a bell and I don't think you can record them any better. They move along the stage when the singers are moving and don't come only from the center channel. I like the voices and the acting of all the principals, Spagnoli is a fine Figaro and Mayo a fine Rosina. The orchestra and the chorus are not too loud or overpowering during loud passages.  Overall, outstanding sound and I guess the 24 bit sampling has something to do with it.Picture is sharp and the video direction is also fine.The production has some quirks, as others have pointed out, but as far as audio is concerned, you won't be disappointed.Few recordings are as good as this one.

1321936,"Synopsis: three friends go skiing, and decide to break a few rules so the more experienced skiers in the group can compensate for what one friend feels is wasted time on bunny hills that the least experienced member of the group used. But because of some confusion amongst ski run workers, the three will be stranded on a lift chair for a week until the park reopens...or they make an attempt to survive.Pros: the suspense scenes were well crafted. Lots of reversals, good acting, it worked. The story line was credible; just a few minor details were stretched for the sake of suspense.Cons: Gory parts, language, and gritty joking. For the most part, though, the coarse joking and most of the language seems to slow down quite a bit once the three realize they're stranded. Still a sprinkling in places, but not as bad. Could get the idea she needs a bathroom without the camera actually showing her southern hemisphere (which is clothed-don't worry). Pacing a bit slow in parts, but overall, a very suspenseful, exciting movie.Just an aside, the reversals really were very good. It's hard to say all the things I liked without giving away the plot, but there is one instance where the source of demise actually allows for survival. Usually you'll have varied circumstances counteracting each other, but in this one, a technical failure becomes a means of rescue. (Not everyone makes it out, of course.)I'd love to see further projects from this talented group, just maybe without the grittiness. Otherwise I thought it was well done.",N/A

435865,"Viewed: 12/10Rate: 112/10: Noticing the amount of secondhand smoke going on throughout She's So Ugly, it's safe to surmise that everybody involved had lost ten years of their lives doing the film. I hadn't seen acting this so unbelievably bad from a cast that contained two major stars, and I don't even think that Robin Wright Penn has been so comparatively bad as other films I've seen involving a female lead with the notable exceptions of Julianne Moore, Sandra Bullock, Nicole Kidman, etc. On the whole, the entirety of She's So Ugly cast has been straight F turkey. It was hard to sit through the movie because I was literally watching a train wreck, and it was also difficult to keep my eyes on the screen. That was so painfully bad that I had to keep noticing that nasty, hideous bump on Harry Dean Stanton's forehead. He and Debi Mazar have to consider retirement from acting because they plain stunk. As for Sean Penn, can there be the most overrated actor alive? She's So Ugly marked the umpteenth time that he broke down crying and feeling sorry for himself in a film. How many times had this been done before? And how many times must this phoniness continue? I am tired of him. Then, there is John Travolta; at the point of him showing up, I had hoped that he would alleviate the pain of the film for me. But nope, he started to stunk it up with the obnoxiousness of his behavior. Speaking of illegal behavior, I couldn't believe that Robin Wright Penn's character was poisoning her fetus with alcohol, smoking, and assumed drug use. Then, I get insulted in the meanwhile that the daughter turned out to be fine. Uh uh...never happens in real life. That was supposed to be a child with a full-blown Fetal Alcohol Syndrome (FAS). Now, honestly...why would anyone, especially somebody with money, to pick up a woman from the gutters who is all beaten up, drugged up, and totally out of it in her mind? That never happens either. Of Sean Penn's character, after ten years in the institution, that's how much he changed? Yeah right...we need more realism here. Some critics have said that this movie is funny. Hm, I don't see it.

1363374,"Since it is not possible to rate performances individually (in which case I would rate Dessay's Zerbinetta five stars), and there are too many negatives (personal preferences) for me to rate the overall performance other than the three stars. Moshinsky's production is adequate in the Prologue and almost non-existent in the opera proper. The conceit of 18th century staging of classical myths in the dress of the time is not a new one. Perhaps it does Ms. Voigt a favor, but I would like to think that she could have been costumed more appropriately in the similar setting that is used in the the film from the Vienna State Opera. She is not the most gifted of singing actresses (perhaps the weight loss has made a difference) moving by the numbers and gesturing in a manner that seems (to me) artificial and contrived. As to the singing I have to admit that I never counted myself in her camp,  but her delivery of the two arias is quite stunning and she easily rises to the challenge. I wonder if she could sing them as well today? Her tenor is quite un-god like, barking and in general singing with little or no distinction. The role is difficult, not too long, but it does require a heldentenor with a good top. It is not uncommon to farm it out to tenors who simply take it on as a job. The one time they didn't was the recording (live) that celebrated the birthday of Strauss: the tenor was Max Lorenz. Alas no one has met that standard set in war time Austria. The rest of the cast was pretty good too!The real star is Dessay, pre vocal difficulties. While in essence I would prefer a German trainied voice (Streich, et. al.) Dessay is quite brilliant, negotiating all the difficulties vocal and otherwise that Strauss wrote. In addition she is so comfortable on the stage that even if her singing weren't as good as it is she would steal the evening. I have admit that I prefer her to the reigning Zerbinetta of the last thiry years, Gruberova. Again, personal preference.In a number of recordings the singer chosen to sing the Composer can be mentioned in the same sentence as the Prima Donna/Ariadne and Zerbinetta. Those were the days when we had Seefried, Jurinac and Zylys Gara. Today mezzos have taken over the role; it doesn't lie that high and a good lyric mezzo should have no strain with top notes. Susanne Mentzer sings the role well, but one only has to hear Seefried (either recording) and Jurinac to hear (and in the case of Juriniac) and see the difference. She does give a good performance and has clearly has thrown herself in the role. As compared with the others currently available in DVD she can be rated very highly.Among the four sets I have, my own personal preference is for the Zurich performance with Emily Magee. She comes closer to to my ideal Ariadne (Cebotari) than any other soprano, combining a radiant soprano voice, great beauty and technique. I will admit that the production is doubtless too outre for most auditors, especially if only one DVD is to be had. Additionally the Bacchus, Roberto Sacca, is only marginally superior to Marginson vocally and carrying far fewer pounds--a visual advantage. The Zerbinetta is the house soprano who will make her Met debut this year, Mosuc. She is several light years from Dessay and Gruberova. Had the Janowitz version been a live performance it doubtless would be the main contender, but it is hardly fair to compare a film with live performances. The Dresden performance should not be overlooked; it afterall was one of the houses that used to compete for Strauss premiers. The Ariadne/Prima Donna, Susan Anthony, is really very good and Sophie Koch another mezzo an excellent Composer. The Zerbinetta is workmanlike and she negotiates the difficulties adequately if not memorably. Colin Davis in a repertroire that one doesn't usually associate with him has the measure of the score.Given the options for the  opera lover who wants an Ariadne in their collection I suspect that this current set will satisfy their needs. Only a curmugeon such as myself will be bothered by objections I have noted.",Richard Strauss: Ariadne auf Naxos - James Levine Celebrating  40 Years at the Met
1191085,"I am a little upset with people who are fans of musicals. There isn't enough product to satisfy our desire and when a very good example of this genre is released, we stay away in droves. I simply don't understand why ""Nine"", the new musical, not to be confused with ""9"", the recent animated film from Tim Burton, s getting pretty unanimously bad critical reviews. I don't understand why fans of the genre are staying away.Directed by Rob Marshall (""Chicago""), ""Nine"" is an adaptation of a very successful Broadway musical adapted from the Fellini film ""8 "". The film contains some very good performances and some amazing vocals and dancing from actors I didn't know could sing or dance. Add to that a beautiful and romantic period setting and you have a film that is a fitting companion piece to ""Chicago"".Are fans of this genre waiting for the next Gene Kelly or Fred Astaire? Is that why they are staying away? Do you secretly desire ""An American in Paris II"" or a remake of ""Singin' In The Rain""? That won't happen (I pray to God). As we continue to evolve and our tastes become more modern, the genres we love have to adapt and change along with us. For a long period of time, the only musicals we could see on the big screen were animated. Many of these were great and provided an avenue for talented people. Then, Baz Luhrmann managed to convince 20th Century Fox to let him make ""Moulin Rouge"". ""Chicago"", ""Mamma Mia"", ""Hairspray"" and more than a few films that should be forgotten followed this. A lot of people didn't like ""Moulin Rouge"" because of the frantic visual style. I loved it. ""Chicago"" is a bit more traditional than ""Moulin Rouge"", allowing the viewer to get involved in the story and characters because they take a moment (every so often) to breath. Now Marshall follows this success with ""Nine"".Rome, the 60s. Guido Contini (Daniel Day-Lewis), a very successful Italian film director is experiencing writer's block after two of his films have flopped. This is unfortunate because his longtime producer is practically forcing him to make his new film.

Even his confidant, and confessor, his longtime costume designer, Lilli (Judi Dench) knows he is having trouble, but she does her best to provide support and a nudge when needed. A set is in production on a huge soundstage at Cincecitta, but Guido is experiencing a midlife crisis and can't come up with anything to write about. When the pressure becomes too great, he runs off to a spa on the Italian peninsula and hides there, trying to escape everyone and everything. He calls his wife, Luisa (Marion Cotillard, ""La Vie En Rose"") and tells her he will be home in a few days. Then he calls his mistress, Carla (Penelope Cruz) and gets her installed in a nearby penzione. When his production team and producer show up at the spa, what was supposed to be rest quickly becomes a working holiday and continues to stress out the famous director. Instead, he begins to remember all of the women in his life and with each memory, comes a new musical number and an equally amusing performance by one of the ladies.I really liked a lot about what ""Nine"" is trying to do. Unfortunately, I also think many of the things I like are also the same things keeping people away from the multiplex.As Guido deals with his writer's block and all of the complications of his life, he begins to remember back to each of the important women in his life and their various influences in shaping who he has become. There are some references to Guido's history with women and the sheer number of sexual partners seems to be large, but there are certain women in his life who are important and he remembers each with fondness. As the memories flood back, Marshall begins to cut some of the most beautiful footage I have seen in a long time into the story, providing us with a biographical glimpse into the director's life. He remembers back to his childhood when he paid a loose woman to show off her private parts to a group of children. This is told through black and white footage and shows the boys running across an Italian beach. When the woman comes out of her hut, ""Be Italian"" begins and the story cuts back and forth from the footage at the beach to a full-blown musical number featuring singer Fergie (from the Black Eyed Peas) as Saraghina. As the musical number progresses, you begin to realize Saraghina and the many other women in the number are actually on the soundstage back in the studio in Rome, it's iconic roman arches ever present. Yet, the singers are sitting on wooden chairs and flinging sand around. It is a visually striking musical number and quickly establishes how the film will unfold.Not only do we start to get a feeling for Guido's life leading up to this crisis, we also realize he is, in fact, remembering things that will eventually make it into the film he has to make next. His memories are showing him his next film, guiding him through the narrative before he writes it.Later, when Carla (Cruz) arrives at the Spa, she sings the song ""Guido, Guido, Guido""; cavorting around in an outfit Victoria's Secret would be smart to copy. Carla is deeply in love with Guido and dances using pink velvet ropes and silk.Judi Dench is surprisingly good when her turn comes. As a major influence in Guido's life, he turns to her for support, guidance, a stern word when needed. She reveals a lot about her background as a fashion designer when she sings the song ""Folies Bergere"", about her early life designing costumes for the racy nightclub in Paris. Dancers in costumes reminiscent of the popular Parisian show dance around the same Roman arches.Kate Hudson is also very good as Stephanie, a young American journalist in Rome writing about the director for a magazine. She follows Guido to the spa and flirts with him, the sexual tension increasing exponentially. This footage is intercut with Hudson and a slew of dancers performing ""Cinema Italiano"", which is, I believe, the one new number written for the film. The musical segment is a lot of fun, very fast paced and done as a tribute to the 60s. Hudson seems to be channeling some of her mom's early persona in the performance.Marian Cotillard and Nicole Kidman are the two most personal female relationships in his life, so their numbers are more introspective and romantic.Sophia Loren plays Mamma and it is great to see her on screen as Guido's conscience. But her musical number is least successful because she doesn't appear to be as good a singer or as comfortable singing. It is more of the ""talking lyrically"" type of song people generally do when they can't do a real musical number.Overall, the musical numbers are very good. Will they be memorable enough to be remembered in a decade? Two? Three? Will Robert Osborne's clone talk about the film one day on Turner Movie Classics? I don't know. But they are fun to watch.This is one of those films set in a very specific place where everyone has a different accent. This aspect of the film reminded me a bit of the big budget films produced in the late 50s and early 60s, the type filled with an International cast to ensure box office success around the world. Daniel Day Lewis' Italian accent is impressive and even more impressive, he sings in the accent. Nicole Kidman does an okay job playing the Italian movie star. Marian Cotillard restrains her French accent and seems to be going for a more American sound. Penelope Cruz is just herself. Strangely, Judi Dench doesn't attempt any accent other than her normal voice and her character is French. Altogether, a bit of a strange hodgepodge. I guess it's better for some to not even attempt an accent if they can't do one. Hearing the actor's normal voice helps you forget they should have an accent. If they did a bad one, you'd never hear past it.Daniel Day Lewis is very good as Guido. At every moment, you can see and feel the world crashing in on him. Forced to attend a news conference to announce the new film, he tries to joke, to flirt, to laugh, all in an effort to hide the fact he hasn't written one word of the script yet. He basically has no idea what the new film should be about. When members of the press get close to unveiling the truth, he flees to the spa.When he is presented with the opportunity to make a change in life, he seems close to taking these leaps, but ultimately the change seems to hard for him and he reverts back to normal. This only serves to drive his crisis.I think it is brave of Day-Lewis to take on this role. We have never seen him sing or dance before and he does a good job with the singing. When he breaks out into song, he retains his accent, never letting it falter.Either his dancing wasn't up to the task, or his musical numbers just weren't designed to involve elaborate dance moves. His dancing resembles what kids would do on a jungle gym on the playground. Hoe holds onto bars and swings around them in large, lazy circles and slides his feet around.The film is set in Italy in the mid 60s. This gives the film a beautiful look; everything appears romantic and almost fantasy like.If you're a fan of the genre, I hope you will make an effort to see this film. If we don't support these works, Hollywood will stop making them. I can already tell you the names of two producers who will most likely never produce another musical again.",N/A
1301523,"Daybrakers tell the story of a future society set about ten years from now. In this movie a epidemic which turned a large number of the Earth's population into vampires broke loose in 2009, most of those uninfected got themselves turned anyway when they saw the perks being a vampire gave them. This has left 95 percent of the world's population as vampires. Now the problem is that with only 5 percent humans left there is not much blood to go around and the movie is about a brilliant vampire scientist who works on developing a blood substitute. One day as he drives home from work he crashes with some fleeing humans, who are now hunted nearly to extinction. Instead of turning them in the scientist decides to help the humans and then begins to question the morality of what vampire society is doing.I enjoyed this movie allot. It is one of the most original vampire movies I have seen in a while. The acting was is, the visuals is brilliant. If you like vampire films or movies about dark futures then this film is definitely for you. I do however have to complaints about Daybreakers. One is that I would have like to see more of this dark future before the real story of the movie started. In any fantasy and science fiction movie it takes a bit of time to really get into the different world you emerge yourself in through the film. There is so much great things here, little commercials on the TV's and technology which is everyday items which is made to support a vampire society, what we get of the world is great, but I would have liked to see more.My second complaint is that the gore in the film seam completely out of place. I have nothing against gore in films. I am a long time horror fan. However in this movie there are some scenes where it seams like the gore was just thrown in just to have some gore, it seams out of place.Except for these two complaints the movie is brilliant. I hate to give a one to five star rating as it is hard to get any details with that. But on a one to ten scale I would give Daybrakers 8 of 9.",N/A

Well, for anyone who ever wanted to get caught up on and with the X Files, Fight the Future is really a great flick. I think they did a great job getting this to the big screen. The acting was typical X Files so for the fan, you would not be dissappointed and for the newby you would really understand the characters being in character.Additionally, this movie takes you all around the world, you basically visit four continents, Africa, Europe, North America and the South Pole. Great FX support a great story line. Of course, you wonder what conspiracy theories and theorists Chris Carter, the creator of XFiles, reads or is aware of. But, really, thinking that ETs are coming to take over earth and there are men who are working with them to minimize any damage to the human race. Who is this cabal of men, secretive from all over the world?The extras in this DVD are also excellent. You really get a sense of Mulder sliding down the insides of the alien ship and actually, the stunt itself was really amazing. I look forward to the next installment of XFiles.",N/A
181969,"The Amazon review and all the other hype on this listing might suggest that this is an interesting movie.  Quite the contrary actually.  Though it started off well, it was frustrating how long and slow it was in reaching its anti-climactic ending.  Gimme a break, is about all I could think from the second half on, and for more than one reason.  A ridiculously convoluted, wanna-be artsy plot and typical melodramatic overacting compliments of Jeremy Irons are only half the bargain in Dead Ringers.  The other half is a more or less glacially slow film, that may keep you watching till the end only to realize you'd have done better turning it off and going to bed.If you liked him in Damaged, then you may enjoy this as well.  I will say it wasn't quite as bad as Damaged in terms of melodrama, but it does have a fair dose of 80s cheese about it and yes the 'artiste's' over-zealous flair. Damaged tried to be art, and so did this one, albeit creepier than average ""art"".  Yes, there's something of a gimmick in Irons playing twin brothers with opposite personalities at the same time, and yes, it must have been a trick to get two Jeremy Irons on the screen at once - but beyond this the movie doesn't have much going for it. Its logic and character motivation make sense only in the mind of the twins - the audience will be thinking ""What?!"".  Also, they should have chosen a more attractive female lead.  Her acting was ok but was hard to believe Irons would let himself go to pieces over her.Final analysis: Dead Ringers tries to create a world, a situation, which never comes off as fully convincing, is occasionally self-consciously over-acted by Irons himself, and finally is nothing less than boring from well before it's half over. In terms of generating interest, it comes nowhere close to Cronenberg's better films ""The Fly"" or ""Videodrome"".",N/A

1383177,"I've liked all of Korine's previous films, so I was looking forward to his fourth feature.  I've concluded that if you're fond of Korine's work, you'll be more inclined to watch and admire this film.  It was shot and edited on VHS equipment, and it's funny at times to see the ""auto tracking"" message and the accompanying video noise.  But the film would have worked just as well on digital video (which is what Korine used in julien donkey-boy), so the VHS is ultimately a gimmick.  The concept of the film (Korine said that the film is supposed to ""be"" like a lost VHS tape that has been discovered, and it has all this strange, random, unexplainable footage on it) is actually more intriguing than the actual film itself.  In that respect, it's similar to some of Andy Warhol's work, like Sleep and Empire, except not as long as those 2 films.  Trash Humpers is a mere 78 minutes compared to the multi-hour endurance tests of Empire and Sleep.I think that Korine was just trying to shock all of us, but I wasn't really shocked by this film.  Having seen Gummo, julien donkey-boy, and Mister Lonely, I am immune by Korine's shock tactics.  I found Trash Humpers funny and kind of sad in a way.  If Korine was trying to go ""punk"" and shock us, it doesn't work.  As a strange, surreal film, Trash Humpers works well at times.  The main characters have ugly, deranged looking old people's masks on, and they look like Grandpa from the original Texas Chainsaw Massacre.There are 2 shorts on the DVD.  Blood in Havana is good (showing one of the Trash Humper characters wandering around Havana, Cuba), but Mac and Plac is way overlong at 27 minutes.  It's essentially a short film of 2 characters in Trash Humpers who play ""cojoned"" twins, and the film seems to consist of outtakes from the film itself, as some of the material in the short is also in the main feature.  Some of it is OK, but Korine put the best parts of the scene in the main movie itself, so it just comes across as a waste of time and not a seperate film at all.Trash Humpers isn't bad for what it is, but I'm glad I didn't pay 12 dollars to see it in a theater.  After the maturity Korine showed in his previous movie Mister Lonely, I wonder why he felt he had to go ""punk"" in his fourth feature.  I'll have to ask him that one day.",N/A

1284536,"I grew up listening to classical music and also playing classical music. Though I have also always liked pop music very much, I never imagined there would come a time when I would reach the point of literally *falling in love* with a pop artist. Never,... until I saw a Michael Jackson video (Dangerous) for the first time. I was in awe. That was about twenty years ago but his limitless talent and his unique charisma, his jaw-dropping performances, his admirable singing abilities were more than I would have ever expected from ANY performer. For different reasons, I never had the chance to see MJ live, but I had the hope that there would come a day when I would be one of the lucky ones standing in the audience at one of MJ's live concerts somewhere in the world. I had been hoping for Michael to return to the stage and, once more, awe the world with his rare talent. It could not happen. More than a year has passed since Michael's passing but I have not been able to come to terms with his death. He was too special.  I am so glad and so thankful to have been able to have this great video. As soon as ""This is it"" became available I got it on DVD. Just recently I also got another copy on blu-ray and I am thinking of getting a third one, just in case. Had Michael had the chance to go on his ""This is it"" tour, it would have been a wonderful show. It didn't happen, and this saddens me deeply. Michael was a very special human being and, as an artist, had a talent like no other. He was the best pop artist that ever lived, he is and will *always* be the best. This video comes to prove that, at almost 50 years of age, Michael was ready, once again, to charm and inspire the whole world. I will never find the words to describe my admiration for this phenomenal artist, for this special man. Love you always, Michael.",Michael Jackson: This Is It Theatrical Release

The Doctor and Leela land on a spacecraft carrying the survivors of the ancient Minyan race on a 100,000-year quest to recover their ""race banks"" from the P7E, a ship that left their home planet millennia ago.For viewers a little sketchy on their classics, this disc includes ""Into the Unknown,"" a mini-documentary in the Special Features menu that spells out in detail all the parallels between ""Underworld"" and Jason and the Argonauts' quest for the Golden Fleece, as well as the many technical challenges the show had to overcome to be delivered on time and under budget.""Underworld"" made extensive use of ""color separation overlay,"" or CSO, technology to create scenery that would otherwise have been prohibitively expensive to build. This, of course, required the actors to perform complicated scenes in an empty studio covered in blue fabric for some 30 minutes of the story's 89 minutes of airtime. The show's designers also made double use of the set for the Minyan spacecraft, converting it into the lost P7E when needed.

The video is from the perspective of archaeologists in the year 2210.

Of note is the extraordinary effort and resources we invest in vehicles and transportation.In each case, the Romans, the City of Phoenix and Aztecs, each culture overshot carrying capacity, resources and water. Politics and short-term decisions trumped long-term sustainability. War and territorial expansion took priority over food, sustainable living and health. As a species we are genetically equipped to deal with short-term crises, but unable to plan ahead for long-term needs and limits.

Why have his skills diminished?  Because he recently lost his girlfriend to a rival hockey player by the name of Jacque Grande, played by Justin Timberlake.  Wait, did I actually watch a film with Justin Timberlake in it?  Yes, and surprisingly, it was very good.The story focuses around just that, Darren (played by Romany Malco), a once all-star caliber hockey player, and star player of the Maple Leafs, has begun to lose his touch in the rink.  His once legendary skills have begun to diminish, due to his recent breakup with longtime girlfriend Prudence (played by Meagan Good).  As a result of the rapid decline of the team's record, Guru Maurice Pitka (Mike Myers) is called in by the owner of the Maple Leafs (Jessica Alba) to try to help Darren get his game and his girl back.Guru Pitka is considered to be the second greatest ""love guru"" in the world.  He has written several books on the subject matter, and his ultimate goal is to appear on the Oprah show and become the number one love guru in the world.  His best shot of achieving this goal is to help Darren and the Maple Leafs reestablish themselves as a highly skilled team.  The story can be lackluster, at times, but the jokes can be quite invigorating.  Through a series of offbeat jokes and major laughs produced by not only Mike Myers, Jessica Alba, Justin Timberlake, Verne Troyer, and Romany Malco, but also by the wisecracking announcer played by Stephen Colbert, the laughs are consistent and frequent.Everyone in the movie seems to have something to prove, not only to themselves, but to someone else as well.  For Darren, it's proving he's more of a man than his mom thought; for Jane it's showing the fans of the Leafs that she is a competent owner; and for Guru Pitka it's much more than what he initially intended.  Many of the jokes come off as ""childish"" and immature, seeming more like jokes that junior high students would find funny, while others are actually quite good.  Mike Myers does a great job at playing the second most famous love Guru, and his humorous acronyms and abbreviations are quite unique.  Jessica Alba, as usual, is beautiful, but looks aside, she does a great job at producing a few laughs of her own.  This seemingly all-star cast did a great job despite the somewhat lacking storyline.  The blooper reel is a great special feature worth checking out as well.

238484,"One of those it-seemed-like-a-good-idea-at-the-time movies, 1981's Sphinx was one of those pictures that looked so much more promising on paper than it did on screen: based on a novel from the author of Coma, which had been a smash hit a few years earlier, directed by Franklin J. Schaffner, who was responsible for Patton and Planet of the Apes, and dealing with the search for a lost tomb and a deadly trade in stolen Egyptian antiquities, it sounded like it should have made for a smart and glossy thriller. It certainly managed the glossy part, with glorious Scope photography of most of the major ancient Egyptian tourist attractions from the pyramids of Giza to King Tut's tomb as well as a cast headed by Lesley Anne-Down, Frank Langella, Maurice Ronet and John Gielgud. It was just the smart bit it never really managed. When she's not telling everybody she meets that she's an Englishwoman who now lives in Boston to explain away her accent, Down's crop-topped Egyptologist reacts to most situations by screaming, even when it would be infinitely safer to keep her mouth shut, and it's pretty obvious that neither of her leading men is entirely to be trusted even if they're not quite as obvious stage villains as John Rhys Davies' smuggler, who actually kicks a dog in his opening scene just to underline what a swine he is.Yet throughout there's the suspicion that, faced with a plot that could have done service in a 1930s programmer despite a few modern retouches, Schaffner and co. have decided not to take it entirely seriously even if they are playing it with an admirably straight face. John Byrum's screenplay certainly seems tongue-in-cheek at times: aside from playing on tourist stereotypes in scenes with Saeed Jaffrey's tour guide, a scene where she hides under the bed from an intruder in her room is played for comedy of embarrassment rather than suspense, one truck chase is filled with throwaway sight gags and the location of the tomb itself, hidden in plain sight, could definitely be said to be taking the urine. Take it on that level and keep your brain switched in neutral for its 117-minute running time and it's entertainingly silly and resolutely undemanding old-fashioned hokum.

1291655,"Family dysfunction is given a lugubrious, sentimental treatment by writer/director Kirk Jones (Waking Ned Devine) in what is actually a remake of a 1990 Italian film,Stanno tutti bene, written and directed by Giuseppe Tornatore, no stranger to sentiment since he made the neo-classic ""Cinema Paradiso"". The earlier film starred the legendary Marcello Mastroianni as a Sicilian civil servant who travels throughout Italy to pay surprise visits to his children after his wife has died. This mirror version stars the equally legendary Robert De Niro as Frank Goode, a former blue-collar worker living in upstate New York, doing the same thing with his grown children. The first part of the plot reminds me of an even earlier classic, Yasujiro Ozu'sTokyo Story, which told the story of an elderly couple who visit their grown children in Tokyo only to discover they have no time for them. That film was a subtle classic that didn't telegraph its emotional impact around contrived plot turns.The same cannot be said for this turgid 2009 drama which bears the sometimes unbearable stamp of manipulation in Jones' overly deliberate treatment with sometimes too-perfectly composed shot compositions courtesy of Henry Braham's immaculate cinematography. The plot follows Frank on his voyage of discovery as he settles into his unfulfilling widowed existence. After being rebuffed by his four children to come home for the holidays, he decides to take matters into his own hands and visit each one of them despite a serious heart ailment. He begins to realize it was his wife who had been the emotional conduit that kept the family in touch despite the divergent paths they all took. Frank sets out by train and bus to surprise each of them in their locales. The first is David, an artist living a boho-type lifestyle in Manhattan, but he isn't home for reasons that will become clear later in the story. Then it's off to see Amy, a successful, Type-A Chicago advertising executive living a life out of the pages of Architectural Digest.Frank moves on to Denver to meet his son Robert, a symphony percussionist whom Frank thought was a conductor, and finally to Las Vegas where he visits Rosie, a dancer living in a luxurious apartment. Needless to say, things are not what they appear, and Frank becomes aware of how estranged he truly has become from his children as revelations start to unfold like clockwork. As an actor, De Niro seems to have settled into a relatively passive figure only evoking the heat of his past performances during key moments. Unfortunately, that happens in the film's worst scene, a hallucinogenic fantasy scene where Frank is talking to his memory of his children as toddlers only to have them talk back like their adults (a bit like the classroom scene in Woody Allen'sAnnie Hallbut without the laughs). Otherwise, De Niro makes his character a befuddling, somewhat endearing presence throughout. Kate Beckinsale plays Amy efficiently but not too deeply. The ad pitch during her sequence is the one unexpectedly funny bit in the whole film.Sam Rockwell fares better as the son since the sense of disappointment is palpable between father and son in his scenes with De Niro. Drew Barrymore uses her natural warmth and likeability to play Rosie as Frank's obvious favorite, a daughter who won't do anything to let her father down. The always watchable Melissa Leo (Frozen River) shows up in a convenient but touching cameo as a sympathetic truck driver who bonds with Frank over their recent spouse losses. The whole plot executes on a series of conveniences such as the blatant connection between Frank's former job in covering PVC cables and the overlapping voiceovers of the siblings on moving images of telephone wires.

Yeah, that same old setup.Add the three most incompetent idiots on the planet, the most feeble ski lift chair ever assembled, the most belligerent wolves ever born, the most inexplicably sharp braided steel cable ever manufactured, and what do you get?  A more than flawed survival ""thriller"" in the snow.Perhaps I feel this way being a self-taught German Alps climber; the plot, idiotic and full of holes, the characters unlikable and numskulled; I legitimately wished for them all to die.The idea of a pack of ""blood thirsty"" wolves on a ski hill, ridiculous.  Wolves in fact hardly ever assault humans unless they are menaced.  They are pack animals that govern their territory from other predators (wolves).

1272410,"Five years on, the episode after episode inability of Booth and Bones to come together as other than crime partners is wearing thin.  The first four seasons were highly comedic and capitalized on Bones's and Booth's relationship as a crime fighting duo who were also reluctantly attracted to one another.  However, this season, they are a mess over one another.  He is clearly and unequivocally in love.  She is also in love but is scared to death of ever acting on it.  This conflict occurs in every single episode.I frankly think to break this impasse it would be better to marry them off and then have the comedic friction come from their problems as a Nick and Nora Charles type couple (""The Thin Man"").  The unrequited love is sapping the considerable energy and magic of this show plus Bones and Booth as a comedic detective team.  Fortunately, the development of Hodkins and Angela is a lot more satisfying for the viewer.  We also have another wonderful guest appearance by Stephen Fry as Gordon Gordon, psychiatrist turned chef.The ""X Files"" developed the same unrequited problem as it continued and it took 9 seasons to bring Mulder and Scully together.  Yes, I kept watching and will keep watching this show for the very same reason, i.e. the episodes week to week make it worth it.  The forensic cases week after week, the interaction of the full cast, the comedy involving the full cast, all of this makes it worth while watching week after week. But the unrequited love over nine seasons made the final few seasons of the ""X files"" barely watchable and I hope that doesn't happen here.",Bones: Season 5
443066,"First, an aside. I don't know why so many reviewer say there is no plot. There is a pretty obvious plot, a very convoluted one, having to do with the payoff for a kidnapping. There are also more than a few sub-plots. What IS true, is, as an earlier reviewer said, the plot is just a McGuffin -- it doesn't really matter what it is, just so long as it brings together the various characters so we can enjoy their interactions. (Maybe that's why it had to be so convoluted.)But the one thing of importance I wanted to add is that the movie is glorious to look at. The cinematography is brilliant as is are conceptions behind it. As a small example, pay attention to the fades between scenes at the bowling ally near the end.

336408,"The is the first film I've seen from Dorothy Arzner, the only female feature director in Hollywood from the beginnings of sound until Ida Lupino started directing at the end of the 1940s.  The fact that this important and still-relevant and moving film isn't yet on DVD certainly doesn't offer much evidence that the position of women in Hollywood is all that much better today.  It was the first film toplined by Rosalind Russell and it made her a star - but not in the typical comedic role that she became known for over the next decade or so.  One wonders if the film and performance were so intense and potent that Russell shied away from such roles for a while, for fear of being typecast as a villainess.Here she's Harriet Craig, a manipulative and completely cold and unfeeling woman who spends her time controlling and manipulating her weak husband Walter (John Boles) into giving up all of his friends and family for her, because she really only cares about his wealth and name - and despite all of the testimonies of others around them, he can't help but to continue to love her.  Russell is extraordinarily convincing, even frightening as a person with no apparent love or feeling, but who in reality just has it all so bound up in fear and doubt that when a crack appears, it quickly turns into a gaping hole.  Mary C. McCall's script, based on a play by George Kelly, doesn't really allow her much sympathy, but when it does you may find yourself bursting into tears as the hollowness becomes apparent and the sense of loss at a life wasted overwhelms.Some great supporting work from all concerned, especially Billie Burke as the somewhat ditzy and too-nice next-door neighbor and Jane Darwell in a typical role as the housekeeper.  John Boles is excellent as well in a somewhat thankless, ""weak"" role, and the great Thomas Mitchell has a small role as his (what else?) drunken friend.  Solidly and smoothly directed, if a little stagy and too readily betraying it's theatrical origins, the film  builds powerfully for an hour and unfortunately wraps up a little too quickly, and some of the more obvious thematic possibilities involving a woman's place and power in society are given short shrift.  The second of the three films based on the then-popular play - Irene Rich starred in the silent version eight years previously and Joan Crawford, a performer much more typically associated with such characters than Russell, took on the role in 1950 in HARRIET CRAIG.Though I wouldn't call this a masterpiece, it's certainly an important film in Russell's career, and in the history of women in Hollywood, and it's crying out for a DVD release.  Criterion, or some other enterprising company, could do worse than to put out a ""Films of Dorothy Arzner"" set.  In the meantime, catch this VHS which is of decent, very watchable quality.",N/A
1155285,"While I was impressed by Winslet and DiCaprio's acting, I couldn't believe how predictable and unoriginal this film was. How many films do we need to remind us that the 1950s wasn't such a great time to be alive? And that all those neatly manicured lawns and sharp-looking fedoras came at a price? I assume films like this are aimed toward Baby Boomers who bore younger people with endless tales about how great their 1950s childhoods were. For the rest of us, this is just a soap opera. Yes, there was conformity. Yes, there wasn't a birth control pill and women had to do their own abortions. Yes, men had to be the sole breadwinners and had to put their family first. Yes, the suburbs are soul-killing and boring. Even Winslet's role felt derivative, an updated version of her character in ""Jude the Obscure"". Every plot twist was signaled a mile away. When DiCaprio eyes a sexy brunette in the office, I said to my friend, ""they will have an affair."" They do. When Winslet starts dancing with her handsome neighbor, I said, ""they will have an affair."" They do. When DiCaprio goes back to being an office drudge, I said, ""she will kill herself, I bet."" And she basically does. No surprises, just a drawn out melodrama with doses of star power, some self-important social commentary and yes, the enlightening revelation that the 1950s were, indeed, a repressive era.",Revolutionary Road

1196186,"Martin Scorcese's 'Shutter Island' may not be as praised or praiseworthy as his recent film 'The Departed,' but it is nonetheless a successfully tense viewing experience. Leonardo DiCaprio is, as expected (lately), powerful, almost overwhelming, as the tumultuous marshal Teddy Daniels. He has been sent to investigate the disappearance of a woman on an island off Massachusetts that consists solely of a prison for the criminally insane. On the ride over, he meets his new partner Chuck (Mark Ruffalo), and at the institute, he encounters a variety of cryptic doctors and disturbed patients.Dr. Cawley (Ben Kingsley) appears to be a forward thinking psychiatrist, while the German Dr. Naehring (Max von Sydow) espouses harsher beliefs about the mad. Between unfruitful interviews, Teddy dreams of his dead wife Dolores (Michelle Williams) and recalls the liberation of the Dachau concentration camp, of which the fenced in island is eerily reminiscent. Kingsley and von Sydow are reliably subtle. Emily Mortimer and Patricia Clarkson are likewise excellent in very different roles.Progressively surreal circumstances make both Teddy and the audience increasingly uncomfortable. The surprisingly straightforward ending has been criticized as cheap and predictable. However, it has enough substance to make the viewer consider seeing the film twice.Problems include one too many smiles by crazy folks. Instead of creepy, they come across as cliche. Also, though visually astounding, flashbacks and dream sequences lack intriguing dialogue. Per usual in adaptations of Dennis Lehane novels (Gone Baby Gone and Mystic River), the love interest is more a foil to the male protagonist than a fully developed character.The movie's slow pace resembles the similarly scored Stanley Kubrick classic 'The Shining.' Though 'Shutter Island' doesn't reach those heights, it is good in its own right, especially towards the middle of the piece, when viewers don't know what to think or hold on to.",Shutter Island
1305567,"Jonah Hex is bad. Really bad. Please turn around now and pick up another movie.Don't trust the low Amazon rating? Read on. I have an almost masochistic fascination with really bad films so I watched this knowing it got terrible reviews from movie-goers and reviewers alike. Sometimes a movie is so bad, you just have to watch it to experience the utter ridiculosity of the filmmaker and new-found heights of cinematic stupidity, like Uwe Boll's seminal crapfestHouse of the Dead, ranked consistently in IMDB's 100 worst films of all time. Even in its awfulness, there's a sort ofMystery Science Theater 3000-like entertainment value as an example of WTF filmmaking to poke fun at. It's so bad, it makes you laugh. Jonah Hex is so bad it makes you want to punch all those involved in bringing this atrocity to the screen. Aside from the sight of the lovely Megan Fox in a bodice, there's really no reason to watch this complete mess of a film. If you enjoyed last summer's bombG.I. Joe: The Rise of Cobra, however, you might like Jonah Hex.Previous reviewers hit it right on the head when they likened JH to Wild Wild West and Van Helsing for its mix of western, sci-fi and steampunk. All 3 films had big, likable stars, were ridiculously campy and failed miserably at the box office. I'll add in another:The League of Extraordinary Gentlemenfor JH's similarity in plot of bad guy building a terrifying ship-based superweapon that can level cities and supernatural/occult overtones. I like hero/anti-hero action, westerns/period films and historical fiction, with an occasional bit of camp, but with a muddled script, a snooze-inducing villain, and a really crappy hero, Jonah Hex manages to get everything wrong in its brief 72 minutes. On top of that, the decision to mix heavy metal into the film was just dumb. The consistently excellent Marco Beltrami provides part of the score and progressive metal band Mastadon provides the rest. Westerns and heavy metal do not mix, especially during shootouts, adding a decided factor of cheese to the whole thing. I like westerns, I like action. I like metal. I do not like them all at once.Never mind some of the severe gaps in storytelling logic: Eli Whitney, inventor of the cotton gin, went on to design a secret super-weapon for the US government that it never built, but it had all the parts and plans just lying around? Never mind that a band of ex-Confederate rebels with no scientific or engineering background can build the thing in a few weeks or the unexplained source of the glowing orbs that provide the explosive power. Never mind because this movie is already so bad that logic gaps can't make it worse.Josh Brolin, who I loved inNo Country for Old Men, is totally uninteresting in his portrayal of the title character. Maybe there wasn't much he could've done with the script. He is devoid of personality and so is his arch enemy, John Malkovich, who looks more like bum than villain and maybe even more boring than he was inEragon. The last time I saw this much wood was at a gay pride parade. Michael Fassbender does give the film a much-needed splash of personality as the vicious and combat-adept Irish psychopath Burke, as does Aiden Quinn as President Grant, and the Smith who makes Jonah's gear. In his brief 2 or 3 minutes onscreen, Smith manages to convey more warmth and personality than Brolin does in the entire film.What killed this movie, aside from the lack of character development and plot that's as chopped up as Hex's face, was just how lame Hex was as a hero. I'm not familiar with the comics, but if Hex is supposed to be the strong, silent type, you won't see it here. Brolin's Hex can hardly fight and gets shot really easily. He's pretty much a wimp and a bungler. I didn't expect to see the archetypal ""Man With No Name"" that Clint Eastwood made famous (though there is a scene ripped off from Fistful of Dollars), but I did expect a solid measure of bad-assedness, self-reliance, and the ability to avoid getting shot, either by using brains, or quick reflexes. He seems to have no knowledge of combat/assault tactics and would've died if not for the unexplained Indian medicine men who keep reviving his sorry carcass. He depends on fancy weapons more than wit, quick-thinking, or fighting abilities. The gatling gun that features so prominently on the movie poster, you see only once. For about 20 seconds. He is so poor at being a hero that he gets ambushed trying to do an ambush -- he gets jumped by Burke as he tries to sneak up the plank to their boat. At night... Lastly is some questionable CG. The crayola-colored dreamworld/flashback sequences are cheesy and poorly done as are some really fake looking explosions. Even the superweapon is lame. It shoots out cannonballs, and then a glowing Dragon Ball to detonate them.Ugh.. watch this only if you feel life is too long. I'm hoping there's a director's cut somewhere that can redeem this movie somewhat. As it stands, 1.5 stars at most.",N/A
450377,"""Way Down East"", was quite a hit when it debuted in 1920.Ninety years is a tad long of a wait for a review. But this drama (perhaps better defined as a melodrama) provides an interesting examination of the moral views of the time, and ours.It's the tale of Anna Moore (played by one of the first movie stars, Lillian Gish), a young woman who cares for her poor, sick mother. Seeking financial aid, she goes to visit her distant, wealthy relatives. The cousins are embarrassed by their poor relation and offer no help. But at one their parties, Anna meets Lennox Sanderson, a true scalawag. (A title card introduces him as a man with ""three interests: ladies, Ladies, LADIES!"")After Anna rebukes Lennox for his attempts at seduction, she agrees to marry him. The cad arranges a phony wedding ceremony followed by a honeymoon, then abandons Anna, who finds she is with child. Adding to the heroine's trouble, her mother dies and so does her newborn child. (There is an interesting, theologically problematic scene wherein Anna baptizes her dying son herself, fearing for his soul.)Anna tries to put her past behind her. She goes to work for a wealthy and yet pious farm family. David Bartlett, the handsome son, falls in love with her and wants to marry her. But when family gossip informs David's father, Squire Bartlett, of Anna's past, his actions are swift and harsh and cloaked in Biblical terminology. We then have the film's action packed set piece and Anna is stranded on an ice flow. (The director, D.W. Griffith, bogarted this straight from ""Uncle Tom's Cabin"". I doubt Griffith, the maker of ""Birth of a Nation"" was a big abolitionist literature fan.)I was surprised by how frankly the film dealt with the issues of sexuality and religious judgment. The movie deals with the hypocrisy of men's immorality being winked though less scandalous behavior of women leads to shunning. The consequence -- condemning a child without a father rather than providing help and comfort -- must have been strong tonic for the time. And viewing trailers for an upcoming teen comedy, ""Easy A"", I've thought the progress of dealing with such issues in the popular culture has not been all for the best.From what I've read about the film (again, no advanced critics' screenings for me), ""Easy A"" is about a virginal high school girl (Olive, played by Emma Stone) who pretends to bed high school boys to enhance their reputations. She then falls under the harsh judgment of the high school Christian club that assures her that she will need to answer to a higher power.Now I could be wrong, but from what I've seen of the new film, it seems to deal with the issues of sexuality and religion with much less nuance than a film made nearly a century ago. It seems all of the Christians in the film are narrow-minded and petty. In ""Way Down East"", some Christians are depicted as mean, but some exude grace. In the new film, it seems that sex is a topic of humor and that it would be crazy for anyone to think there could be any negative consequences. (Only Christians could be so crazy, to still believe in avoiding sexual immorality as Paul teaches in Romans 13: 13 or I Corinthians 6:18.)It is wrong for Christians to judge the sins of others, but it is also wrong to fail to teach that God does have standards for sexual behavior. We should be people with tender and loving hearts. God, as a loving Father, provided sex as great gift in the context in marriage. All around us we see the victims of abuse of God's gift, whether it be men addicted to online porn, women selling themselves for money (or even a false display of affection) and, yes, children who, according to studies, are less likely to prosper without the care of two loving parents.We need to be faithful to not condemn those suffer from the sin that is common to us all, but rather comfort and strengthen those that are weak.To find a source that deals much better with these issues, you might want to go to a popular novel. I believe the title ""Easy A"" comes from a work that is now 160 years old, ""The Scarlett Letter"". Sexual sin and religious hypocrisy are nothing new. But fortunately, God's grace is very old, yet ever fresh.",N/A

369005,"Usually, Disney films are filled with such sappy schmaltz that even the most emotional of viewers have a hard time being drawn into the story.  ""Angels in the Outfield"", for a change, strikes exactly the right chord between emotion, humor, and just plain fun that makes a joy to watch again and again.Here's the basic plot: A young orphan named Roger (Joseph Gordon-Levitt) is promised by his deadbeat Dad that the family will come together again when the downtrodden California Angels baseball team wins the pennant.  After a heartfelt prayer from Roger on that very matter, he begins to see a swarm of angels, led by the enigmatic ""AL"" (Christopher Lloyd), helping the team finally start to move up in the standings.  The Angels' manager, Mr. Knox (Danny Glover), begins to take a liking to young Roger, first viewing him as a good luck charm, then starting to believe in the magic surrounding the team.What I really find charming about this film comes in two different areas: First, the humor doesn't pander to the kiddies.  I'm in my twenties and, though being a baseball nut helps this process, can still laugh out loud at many moments throughout the movie.  Also, the message is just heartfelt enough to resonate with me emotionally, but not overly done to feel sickening.The acting is terrific all the way around, as the kids, players, manager, and even all the auxiliary performers shine in whatever capacity they are given.  The sport of baseball is known for harboring some colorful characters, and this film doesn't spare you from that aspect of the game!Thus, I consider ""Angels In The Outfield"" to be one of the best family films I have ever seen.  Plus, if you are a baseball fan whatsoever, the subtle references and situational humor will make you appreciate the experience even further.",Angels in the Outfield VHS

93919,"You know those movies that you know you should theoretically hate -- they're cheesy, they're weird, and they're predictable.But somehow... you just can't do it. ""Mortal Kombat"" is a cheesy, weird, predictable movie that is basically all about an Evil-For-The-Sake-Of-Being-Evil Villain, some wooden characters, and and an expanse of over-the-top action sequences. But somehow it's so unpretentiously video-gamish (well, DUH) that it's impossible to hate.Brief backstory: Mortal Kombat (with a K!) is a once-a-generation tournament in which fighters battle for the sake of their respective worlds. If the evil sorcerer Shang Tsung (Cary-Hiroyuki Tagawa) and his evil minions win this one, he gets the Earth.And he's successfully manipulated three humans into going: Liu Kang (Robin Shou) who wants to avenge his brother, actor Johnny Cage (Linden Ashby) who wants to revive his career, and agent Sonya Blade (Bridgette Wilson) who wants to avenge her dead partner. They're guided by the mysterious thunder god  Raiden (Christopher Lambert), who... doesn't fight. He's just kind of a Yoda.But even before the three fighters arrive at the island where the tournament will take place, they're confronted by danger -- Shang Tsung has brought his deadliest three fighters to destroy all three of them, and they don't care much about rules. Can the gang overcome their personal issues and win Mortal Kombat? Can you guess? Do I even need to ask?I openly admit it: I have never played ""Mortal Kombat"" video games, so I had no preconceptions about what this movie would be like.As for what it actually is like: a lot like watching an action anime when they get to the inevitable tournament -- lots of creative action scenes involving flames, ice-balls, a guy with four arms, and people wandering through a shadowy, cobwebbed palace. It's mindless, overserious, cheesy fun and... somehow it doesn't bother me.And I won't sugarcoat it: this is a plotless, bubblegum movie with all the important twists phoned in about ten minutes before they happened. I mean, did anyone NOT think Shang Tsung would shapeshift into Liu Kang's brother at some point to mess with his head? OF COURSE HE WOULD. AND DID. But somehow I can't hate it. It's just... kinda fun.The actors are mostly of the they're-okay-but-not-great -- Shou is pretty likeable as Liu Kang despite the random tantrums he has, Wilson is mildly annoying, Ashby's one-liners are so annoying that you'll want to drop an anvil on him (""I pay money, you carry the bags""), and Lambert is hugely underused. But Cary-Hiroyuki Tagawa is weirdly fun as Shang Tsung -- he always seems to be sitting halfway between ""affably evil"" and just EVIL.""Mortal Kombat"" is cheesy, cliched but still somehow entertaining -- perhaps it's all the more entertaining because you know you're only in it for the buttkicking.",N/A
1254362,I am not a big fan of comedy movies so I cannot say this is one of my favorite movies of all time but the only reason I bought it and watched it was because Tom Sturridge was in it and I find him the most  beautiful man in the world. I love to see anything that he is in whether I like the plot of the film or not. Also I was grossed out by fug ugly Talulah Riley and that fat dj man who was gross and perverted. Otherwise I thought Philip Seymour Hoffman was the life of the movie and the best actor in it. I think this is more a movie for a sixties fanatic. As I said the only reason I got it is because Tom Sturridge was in it.,N/A

The settings, costume styles, and score make it worth seeing second from the brilliant script and performances by such great actors as Sir Ian McKellen, Brendan Fraser, and sadly missed Lynn Redgrave (RIP).  This is a truly correct blend of talent that is reminiscent of another film released that year, ""The Talented Mr. Ripley"", as well as many of the classics.  Great art makes me cry, as this film's end did in '99, and still does today.  If you are interested in classic films, and high intellectual art, this DVD is for you.

1308079,"PREDATORS takes us back to what made the first film so damn good. One good move is in ensuring that there weren't sexy sullen teens mucking about, and this works to right away remove that teen slasher stench that piggybacked the franchise with the second AVP film. A suspenseful atmosphere is evoked from jump, as the opening scene features a man waking up in freefall. The parachute activates, and the stranger lands on a foreboding steamy jungle, and he's soon joined by other deadly-looking humans, all heavily armed. A sweeping glance informs that this isn't a band of saints and samaritans. Our eyes take in the San Quentin inmate, the death-squad goon from Sierra Leone, the IDF sniper, the heartless mercenary, the Latin Mafia thug, the Spetsnaz operative, the Yakuza gangster, and, er, a physician. Later on, Laurence Fishburne surfaces, and his crackpot character is also pretty unsavory.This group of nasties soon learn that they're been abducted to a hostile alien planet (the non-moving sun is a strong giveaway). It dawns on them that this alien planet is, in fact, a hunting preserve. And that they are the prey. So it doesn't take long before that bump of self-preservation kicks in and our characters are jockeying for position.The suspense is terrific. These cold-blooded killers on the run leave you perplexed as to who to cheer for, excepting Alice Braga's Isabelle. She seems to be the only straight shooter in this shady bunch. On the other hand, Topher Grace's doctor character seems so out of place I wasn't sure what to think of him. To segue now, PREDATORS resolves the different looks that these chittering, crab-faced alien hunters have espoused down the years. It turns out there are different classes of Predators, and that some look down on others. This becomes a crucial plot point.Folks may bemoan the absence of Arnold Schwarzenegger or Jesse Ventura or Carl Weathers. Topher Grace is certainly no Schwarzenegger, and neither is Adrien Brody. Heck, the notion of Adrien Brody as an action hero boggles the brain. But then you sit thru this film, and it's a bit of an eye-opener. Brody as the prohibitive lead character seems a casting choice that's just off the beaten path. And yet Brody manages to go from tickling the ivories in THE PIANIST to bulking up and being badasss and adopting a growly Batman-type voice. He pulls it off. Alice Braga, the Brazilian bombshell, isn't quite the action heroine that Ripley or Sarah Connor were, but she injects depth to her character, and she is, I reiterate, a Brazilian bombshell. And, from out of left field, Louis Ozawa Changchien becomes an unlikely gent to root for. Changchien doesn't get a lot of lines but, as the Yakuza killer Hanzo, he exudes great presence. From the moment he's introduced, in his dapper suit, he was an instant favorite, and the film treats him with courtesy.I love the hell out of the 1987 Schwarzenegger film, and I promptly recognized the musical score that heralded Hanzo's showdown with the Predator. It's the same score - but now with Oriental flourishes - that played back in '87 while Billy (remember him?) calmly stood there at the bridge, awaiting his death. Throughout its narrative, this sequel made subtle use of the original score from the original PREDATOR.Danny Trejo is here also and in IMDb his character is listed as ""Cuchillo,"" and this makes me smile.PREDATORS vastly improves on your generic sci-fi thriller. It is intense and moody, and action-packed and well-acted. For the most part, the pace moves briskly, and the fun as always lies in trying to pick out which of the cast are the victims and survivors. This is a welcome follow-up; it doesn't at all embarrass the franchise. Maybe one nitpick is that the kills aren't so innovative or jaw-dropping, although I did enjoy that moment of no-nonsense spine removal. I get the definite sense that we as a movie-going audience have become pretty desensitized. I know I lost MY innocence when I saw that cartoon of Godzilla stepping on Bambi.The DVD's bonus material includes audio commentary by producer Robert Rodriguez and director Nimrod Antal. ""Decloaking the Invisible: Alien Terrain"" is the Behind the Scenes featurette (00:10:41 minutes long). Click on the ""Motion Comics"" selection and you're presented with motion comics vignettes labeled under ""Moments of Extraction"" and ""Crucified"" and voiced by the actors of PREDATORS. To break it down even more, ""Moments of Extraction"" briefly fleshes out the back stories of Isabelle (00:02:15 minutes) and Mombasa (00:02:06), while the dialogue-absent ""Crucified"" chronicles the capture of the weaker Predator (00:02:08).

1078573,"To the long and already rambling list of attempts to juice up Sherlock Holmes for mass media audiences, we add this well-meaning but misguided whirlwind.  In what appears to be a pilot that never went to series, Holmes' preteen street squad takes center stage in an attempt to fight through the wall of crime that is Victorian London.  This one is blessed with an excellent Holmes in Jonathan Pryce, but is marred by an inability to decide what story it wants to tell.Some other reviewers have disparaged the way in which this telemovie retcons the role of Irene Adler.  I'm not sure the target audience of young viewers would much care.  I suspect that they would be more interested in the fact that the child characters' hand-wringing is particularly unappealing.  If the kids were to pull their thumbs out, the whole story would be over in thirty minutes.This story has its redeeming moments, particularly when the emphasis shifts to the grown-ups.  But then, why pretend this was produced for kids?  I really liked watching Pryce as Holmes trying to solve the mystery without leaving his lodgings.  The layers he has to work through make these parts of the story interesting.  But on the whole, this movie is a miss that doesn't have much of an idea who its audience is, or how to make them care.",SHERLOCK HOLMES AND THE BAKER STREET IRREGULARS
571653,"""Highway Star"" is the first song on this, and for the first third or so of it they perform as a 4 piece with no guitar anywhere. Then where the organ solo normally is, Blackmore makes his entrance; grabbing the spotlight, charging in with some ferocious guitar flourishes, stalking over to John Lord's side of the stage and marking his territory like a bull terrier,I mean it almost looks like he's going to physically ram into one of the other guys, the look on Roger's face...did I mention this is where Lord's organ solo normally is? After this song there is a brief composite of talking from the Purple guys, ruminating over the difficulties of having a guitar player, guitar player MIA from these segments. This is a great concert. Purple is an incredible buffet of top tier talent, a band so fluid, their influences are trades they have become masters, not hacks at; with a singer who fancies TS Elliot, whiskey and women, I would say in any order.  A band who had gotten more potent with age, and would never approach parody. Ritchie's allegations of nostalgia further fortifying a deep committment to integrity. Ritchie got a cool million just to show up, and deserves respect for walking away from the future cash to pursue his artistic vision. But the parrying and jostling with his bandmates is ever present, and very entertaining, Purple being the one group of guys who can handle said guitar player.  The Purple guys feel slighted by Ritchie's claims, and they shoud be, because it clearly disrespects the verve they put into the new Purple. Two of the new songs, ""Battle"" and ""Anya"" are highlights of the concert, brilliantly maneuvering Zeppelin avenues. And a wicked sense of humor: there's a song that opens with the ""Jaws"" theme that's about uh, well you'll have to see. And Gillan, Blackmore is better than Clapton, he wipes the floor with all of them.",N/A

918519,"This 14 movie, 15-disc set of digitally remastered prints includes some of Hitchcock's best-loved films.  Here in one convenient package are breathtaking new transfers (anamorphic widescreen when appropriate) of timeless, suspenseful stories that brilliantly ""rub fear against hope"" including all time fan faves PSYCHO, THE BIRDS, VERTIGO, REAR WINDOW, SHADOW OF A DOUBT, THE MAN WHO KNEW TOO MUCH, and SABOTEUR.I saw Alfred Hitchcock only once, near the end of his life.  He was standing in front of his famous bungalow office on the Universal lot waiting for a photographer.  Cherubic and surprisingly handsome in his $2500 Seville Row suit, he was the picture of success.  Everything looked perfect -- except the corner tip of the collar of his white shirt was noticeably bent.Later, I discovered that Hitchcock had his tailor put an intentional bend in his collar because he was attracted to things that look perfect but in fact are slightly flawed.  He often said, ""a tiny flaw is always more interesting than perfection.""Although his films usually combined murder, mystery, fear, suspense, and romance, he had no interest in ""who dunnits"" because that was merely an ""intellectual exercise.""  He wanted to trigger emotion in an audience.  Even more than that, he wanted to make them sweat.Hitchcock's films have a seductive, even fetishistic subtext that's been attributed to his own personality.  Cool blondes in literally painful situations are a recurring motif (often as victims of psychologically flawed but otherwise charming individuals).British born Hitchcock was a trained artist.  All his films, even the early silents, are carefully composed with an intuitive sense of where to place the camera to best convey the visual essence of the scene.  Dialogue was never of more importance than the flow of images.  And he rarely shot footage that was not part of the final film.  For him, plotting the story and designing the film shot-for-shot was what most interested him.  Shooting the actual film was almost an afterthought since every shot had already been carefully considered and finalized on paper.Hitchcock's best films can be seen over and over.  That's the beauty of this great collection that also includes MARNIE, ROPE, THE MAN WHO KNEW TOO MUCH, TORN CURTAIN, FRENZY, FAMILY PLOT, TOPAZ and THE TROUBLE WITH HARRY.  There's over 14 hours of special material (14 documentaries, 9 featurettes, commentaries, newsreel footage and more).  A bonus disc has interviews with Hitchcock, an AFI tribute and two fascinating films on the making of THE BIRDS and PSYCHO.",Alfred Hitchcock: The Masterpiece Collection
706930,"The *only* reason why this production rated even one star is because it is based on a C. S. Lewis classic and you can hardly go wrong with a film premised on C. S. Lewis.  That said, this production of The Lion, The Witch and the Wardrobe is at the very best mediocre.  Not only the acting, but the set designs and settings are nothing short of incompetent and shoddy.  To be even third-rate could only be something that all those involved in the production of this garbage aspire to.  That the BBC was too cheap and miserly to make this classic into a truly excellent film is no excuse for the totally incompetent acting and cheesy set design and animation.  When a far, far superior product (the Disney production) is available for virtually the same price, I can only see the BBC charging the same for this DVD because they are accustomed to gouging and cheating the public by charging unreasonable high prices for shoddy merchandise of little to no quality.  Not only is the Disney production a far superior adaptation of the C. S. Lewis classic, the graphics, animation and acting are light years better than the BBC's production -- and at nearly the same price.  BBC, you should hang your heads in shame.",N/A

1305270,"Christopher Nolan's follow-up to 2008's megahit The Dark Knight was rumored as many different films that had been seen by no one. ""This film is revolutionary!"" ""It sucks!"" ""It's dumb and pointless!"" ""It's amazing!""  And having finally seen Inception, without many expectations, I can tell you that if you were to see one film, for the remainder of the summer, you should make it Inception.Inception has alot going for it. Its cast works wonders, because every actor brings something fresh and new to the table. It never feels outdated, or irrelevant. It's original without being idiotic. It's intelligent without being implausible. It doesn't take its extremely layered plot too seriously, and there's one thing that really separates it from any other summer action flick: It requires a great deal of thought. You don't know where it's going next. Once it pulls you into its clutches, it takes you on a ride that is unlike anything you've seen onscreen in years. Its ending will be debated, analyzed and picked apart by many film snobs across the world, and it's a film that doesn't just deserve, but requires multiple viewings. It's a hell of alot to take in at once.Now, in any film review, a reader would like to know what the piece is about. This one's plot is better left unsaid, because the first viewing is enough to leave the audience in utter awe. However, I'll do my best to at least give you an idea.Leonardo DiCaprio outshines any of his previous works, playing Dom Cobb, a thief who is proficient in extraction (going into a subject's mind, during dreams, and stealing their ideas, and using them against them), who is embarking on one final job before he can retire, and go home for good. Instead of stealing a subjects dream, he and his team decide to do the opposite. Not to steal a dream, but to go into a person's subconscious and plant an idea.Joseph Gordon-Levitt, of (500) Days Of Summer fame, and Ellen Page, of Juno fame, Marion Cotillard, of Nine and La Vie En Rose greatness, Ken Watanabe, of The Last Samurai, Cillian Murphy, of indie film fame, and a few legends (Michael Caine and Tom Berenger) are the heart of this film. There is truly great acting all around. Everybody brings something new to the table. Each character is richly detailed, and multi-layered. Nobody is really who they say they are. Gordon-Levitt, Page and Cotillard are a few of my favorite actors of the current generation, who haven't had their ""big breaks"" quite yet. They've had a few parts that they're semi-well known for, and this film is a fabulous transition into mainstream cinema. That's because this is an art-house film that is financed by a major studio. That's the beauty of it. Insight, intelligence and uncanny originality are things you don't see in movies anymore. It's a breath of fresh air to see something as unique and interesting as this.But, at the end of the day, it's Christopher Nolan's genius ideas, smart script, elegant direction, and masterful artistry that make this picture what it is. This is a film that I could picture the writer-director losing his mind over. It's his story, it's his game. He invents a world that you've never seen in any type of film before. It's reminiscent of The Matrix, and the early James Bond pictures. It creates its own metropolis, and its own rules. It breaks the rules of conventional American cinema. And thank god for that. Inception is one of the best films so far in 2010.",N/A

972996,"Watching `Benny's Video' I almost find myself desensitized.  It is a rare feat to get me to feel absolutely cold emotionally.  I remember when I saw `Elephant' for the first time, and I felt so distant and separate from the madness ensuing on the screen.  It was so horrible, so atrocious and yet I didn't care.  It didn't bother me.  I get a similar feeling when watching `Benny's Video'.  Watching Benny commit a heinous crime with a seemingly callous attitude is at one moment infuriating and at the other strangely acceptable.  His actions, while completely contradictory to what I would have expected, are so genuine they seem almost appropriate.  I know that that sounds just plain ridiculous, especially to anyone who has seen the film, but `Benny's Video' has been the center of many debates between my fellow cinephiles and I, and for precisely this very reason.As the film ends we are all left wondering WHY?`Benny's Video' tells the story if a fourteen year-old boy named Benny who becomes obsessed with a home video of a pig slaughter that he shot while he was at a farm with his parents.  He watches the video over and over and even rewinds and watches in slow motion.  Then, quite suddenly, he invites a young girl he's never met to his home while his parents are away for the weekend where he shows her the video, then shows her the device used for killing the pig (which he stole from the farm) and then proceeds to kill her, all the while filming the act.What happens next is up for serious debate.As Benny attempts to clean up the body we see this coldness come over him.  He talks to his friend on the phone, goes out dancing, spends the night at his friends home, goes to school, gets a hair cut; anything but show any sign of emotional distress until he simply plays the home video he made of the slaying for his parents.  It is in this moment that the film takes a sudden shift.  I don't want to get into too much of the film, for it is in the unveiling of the third act that most of the true debate can be spawned, but I do want to express the moral complexities I think this film explores.  When you look at the act which Benny commits, it's hard to justify (well, there is no justification) a reason why.  In fact, its hard to find one, and I think that is what makes this film so brilliant.  It is easy to lash out at the parents or Benny's sick fascination with violence portrayed on film, but I think it's far deeper than that.  I'm constantly brought to a scene where, after Benny shaves his head, his father confronts him about his rebellious attitude and simply states that Benny can't say they don't love him and can't blame it on them.  I'm glad that Haneke had this put in the film because it makes it harder on the audience.  Now we have to find another outlet.  And just when we think we are looking in the right direction, Benny's father comes up with a `plan' to hide his son's crime that totally changes the game for us.There is that coldness again.And then the ending, which I found to be a complete shock and totally masterful (unforgettable), is something I am still trying to contemplate.Haneke is known for his approach to violence and voyeurism and the human psyche; how this all plays into who we are as individuals, and while `Benny's Video' is one of his earliest films (his sophomore feature film), it is (for me) one of his strongest.  A friend of mine felt that Haneke raised a lot of good points and observations here, but that he didn't complete them, but for me Haneke never completes his ideas and that is why I love him so much.  He presents to the audience something brutal and forces us to complete the process on our own, making the film all the more haunting.Oh, and lastly I just want to give a standing ovation to Angela Winkler's teeth chattering scene; truly devastatingly real (or was it?).",N/A

268408,"The third of John Ford's three films from 1939, and second in a row starring Henry Fonda is a lavish Technicolor adaptation of a 1936 bestselling novel of the same name by Walter D. Edmonds.  The second western in color after JESSE JAMES earlier that year, which also starred Fonda, it's Ford's first color film and the only one he made before 1948's THREE GODFATHERS.  It's a revolutionary-era frontier film, so it can be seen as sitting astride both the war and western genres, though on the whole I think it feels closer to the former.Fonda is Gilbert Martin, a settler in upstate New York who marries Lana Borst (Claudette Colbert), daughter to a wealthy family, in 1776 and moves with her to his farm in the Mohawk Valley - just as the war is getting going, and spreading into this at-the-time remote area.  Soon the Martins have to flee their farm to the safety of Fort Herkimer, as the British and large numbers of Mohawks attack.  Farm burned, they have little choice but to go to work for a landowner who still has property, the widow Mrs. McKlennar (Edna May Oliver), but the war rears its ugly head again shortly and they again have to repair to the fort for the film's long climactic battle sequence.Though the battle scenes are fairly fast-paced and there's a terrific chase sequence involving Martin on the run from several Mohawks over hill and through stream and brush, much of the film is, as usual for Ford, leisurely paced and concerned with community and familial ties.  Mrs. McKlennar, in a wonderfully warm if often biting performance by Oliver (nominated for an Oscar for the role) becomes in the film something like a glue that holds the communities of fort and settlers together, helping to build up the confidence of the Martins and other young farmers as their livelihoods disappear, and perpetual Ford stock company veteran Ward Bond is at hand as Adam Hartman, a jovial and larger-than-life presence who contrasts nicely with his friend the more stolid Fonda character.  Chief John Big Tree of the Onondaga plays Blue Back, the one friendly native throughout the story, and though he's certainly stereotyped in his speech patterns it's a fairly dignified performance and role - notably he disdains whiskey when first offered it.  And last but not least, John Carradine is on hand as the sinister one-eyed man the Martins meet early on while staying at an inn on their journey to their new home - but whose questioning of their political loyalties proves notable later in the film.There is one real problem in the cast, and that's Colbert - or rather, the character of Lana.  I try not to bring too much of a 21st century mentality into viewing women's roles in films of this vintage, but the early scene of Lana falling apart on first encountering a ""savage"", the harmless Blue Back, and a couple of later moments really have to make one wonder what Martin saw in her - and how well he bothered to prepare her for what she would encounter in the wilds.  To be fair, she becomes a stronger character later in the film, and I suspect it was Ford's intention to show her growth into a tough pioneer woman, but some of those early scenes can't help but feel exaggerated and a little bit cringe-worthy to me.  It's not an enormous problem overall, and it certainly doesn't wreck the film, but it does keep me from being as enthusiastic about it as I am for many of Ford's other films from this period.Bert Glennon and Ray Rennahan provide the gorgeous early Technicolor camerawork - the chase sequence, with Martin silhouetted against the flaming sun in particular is quite well done - and Alfred Newman the rousing score, full of Revolutionary-era themes and songs that give the film, made on the eve of another war, a strongly patriotic and chest-thumping feeling - though it never gets to the level of propaganda, thankfully.",N/A

1264802,"If Coen brothers can choose to make a movie about suburban middle-class alienation, why not have a physics professor at the mediocre local midwest college pose as a main protagonist?  This film is a black comedy, set in 70s dreadful neighborhood of Minneapolis.  It is a very ""Jewish"" humor kind of film and to some degree it reminded me of Woody Allen's ""Radio Days"".  In any case, I truly enjoyed this film that provides an original story about a middle aged man who totally gets blindsided by so many things going on in his life all at once: he is due for tenure at the college where he teaches undergraduate physics degree, his wife is ready to leave him for another man, his children are struggling with their own pre-adolescent angst and his students are a whole another story....This is one of these movies that may be an aquired taste for Coen brother kind of black comedy that is both entertaining and disturbing at the same time.

Great visuals & special effects, the kind that make it worth rewatching just to catch more of the details.  I enjoyed it enough... and don't regret buying the DVD, although it's less than a 5-star in my collection as well.  Interestingly successful at adapting the storyline with other headline actors to accommodate finishing of the film after the untimely death of Heath Ledger.  As a fan of Johnny Depp, however, I am probably partial in saying I probably would've enjoyed it much more if JD had played the main character from start to finish.  Christopher Plummer brings nobility to the cast & Lily Cole is very easy on the eyes.  One missed opportunity - The bonus features didn't do much to enhance appreciation of the film as they do in some other DVD sets.  All in all, a valiant rescue of a film that may not have ever been released.  All members of the cast did a good job & complemented each other nicely.",N/A

326842,"This made for TV movie was done in 1986, so one must remember the audience expectations and standards of the time and the fact that the very graphic scenes of blood and violence and gore were not really done for prime time TV at this point.It is an interesting reenactment of the Ted Bundy murder spree. Many incidents are only hinted at for their horrifying details. Unless you know the case, other than the numbers, which even then this only hints at you will not get any where near the whole horrorThe film only hints at Ted Bundy's involvement, there is some doubt for a time if it was coincidence.I do not enjoy seeing gore and graphic violence, but other than some blood spatter on pictures at the end; the movie is so very sanitized that even the last murders at the sorority house and the killing of a 12 year old girl only show a small extent of the violence of Bundy's physical attacks.Mark Harmon does a good job, in that he portrays this man who had all of his acquaintances fooled until the very end. His innocent sweet, next door neighbor looks do not lend any menace at all; but maybe that was what made Bundy so successful in his ability to pick up these girls. There is very little motive given either for this huge killing spree.Where the movie shines is in Bundy's relationship with the law enforcement officials as they closed in on him as a suspect and how he could escape not once but twice.It is a strangely fascinating movie to watch and will give you insight into the Ted Bundy case.",The Deliberate Stranger VHS

Therefore I laughed at this movie until my tummy hurt. My wife stared at me for most of the movie with a look of puzzlement on her face. LOLIf you understand why its funny to eat dough-nuts with M&Ms; inside so that you don't have to eat M&Ms; after you finish eating the dough-nuts, then you've just passed the litmus test for whether you'll laugh at this movie. If you don't think the M&M; thing is funny for any reason, give this a pass. Not everyone has to see and like every movie.Personally, I thought the special effects were very good, except for those that were intentionally cheesy to match the TV show, in good fun.The desert scenes were a real treat, with various objects from Earth (and elsewhere) sticking up out of the sand in various spots. I had a lot of fun just trying to spot all the odd objects scattered about those scenes.The characters have different relationships than the old show. Holly is ""all grown up"", and very pleasingly so.And someone bemoaned the character development? They should pay attention. Will's character goes from being a disgraced scientist on a self destructive eating binge to a successful, self confident scientist, his theories validated, who can tell Matt Lauer to ""Suck it"" and get away with it. What more in the way of character development can you ask for than that??? LOLNow, this isn't the great comedy of the coming decade, but if you like Ferrell, you will find amusement here.

187717,"Back when I was in my 20s (a few decades ago), I met a few gals that were like Catherine in Jules and Jim, seriously emotionally underdeveloped.  Fortunately for me, I wasn't attracted to them, the malignancy in their personalities had shown through making it clear to me in advance that something wasn't right.  And arguing that Catherine may have been a little more subtle than those is contradicted by the outcome of the movie.  But the real problem with Jules and Jim is that it just doesn't ""build"" up to it very well.  There's not really a detectable progression, Catherine's character should have been more and more obvious, either through gradual reveal of relevant elements, or by the development of unremarkable characteristics into unusual ones.  While there's the isolated jump-in-the-river instance as a bit of a clue, there's little else that leads to where the movie ends up.  Frankly, it seemed to me a 1960s free-spirit-Antonioni forerunner until the end bent it more toward fatal attraction.By the middle of the movie I just figured Jules and Jim were a bit thick in letting Catherine get away with her shenanigans rather than simply giving her the boot.  None of the characters were very compelling, I was reminded of all the reviews I've read about movies where the reviewer didn't care about any of the characters-- that seemed to sum it up for me until the ending, which finally showed that the plot wasn't supposed to be  (or shouldn't have been, anyway) quite as aimless as it had just appeared.I suspect the movie is underdeveloped because is was done when Truffaut was still pretty young, before he had the experience to understand the emotional and psychological nuances that would have made this movie one heck of a lot better.  Emotional content would really fill out the story here, but as it is, it's a pretty shallow representation.  There's certainly far worse movies, but Jules and Jim is nowhere near as good as The 400 Blows.",N/A
1028187,"The Darkroom is one of those movies that's honestly really *really* bad in every conceivable way, but for some really mysterious reason... I can't bring myself to criticize it because on some unexplainably deep personal level, I actually enjoyed it.First of all, the acting.  It's horrendous.  Actually what makes the acting so terrible is the way each of the main characters delivers his or her line.  After delivering it, there's an odd moment of noticeable silence.  This probably has less to do with the actual acting itself and more of an inexperience level on the part of the writers for not realizing when to trim the fat, so to speak, so as a result some segments linger longer than they honestly should.A good example is right in the very beginning when the teenage boy is talking to a guy in a diner who just escaped from an asylum.  In addition to these scenes carrying on longer than necessary, what's most awkward about them is the way you hear silence after every line.  Almost like you're hearing the wind blow in the background.  It gives the entire movie a low budget feel.The storyline actually isn't terrible, and has potential (and even achieves its potential in a few spots).  It's fairly well-written and, though entirely cheesy, isn't without its moments.  The writers were at least trying for something here.You better believe the actual ""scary monster"" is nothing more than a pitiful attempt and scaring the viewers by having some guy dress in a costume and making the camera jerk around in dizzy fashion in order to give off some fears.  This is hilarious.What won me over (actually I mean, what makes me feel guilty about winning me over) is the actual ""dark room"" itself.  The teenage boys stepdad has a dark secret, and that secret is revealed inside of this room.  There actually was a nice bit of atmosphere building up to the mystery of what's located inside the room between the supposed ""evil"" stepdad, the eager-to-discover teenage boy, and the drunk mother.  Every time the boy wanted to find out what's inside, something would prevent him from doing so.  I enjoyed these segments.By the way, how hilarious is it that the teenage boy kept claiming his stepfather was a jerk, only to have him be nothing but!  He actually came across as extremely polite and considerate, trying to help his family the best way he can.  FAR from being a jerk of any sorts.However, the film completely misses the mark in being truly terrifying.  No, that bigfoot-like ""bad guy"" creature running around town in a costume is definitely NOT scary, haha.Overall, yes, it's amazingly corny, but it actually is worth watching on some level of desperation, lol.",Dark Room
1038262,"What can I say?  Do you love disaster flicks?  This is the double combo that you've been looking for, almost.  Since there are 2 movies on this disc I'll take each one separately.10.5 - This is the weaker of the two disaster movies on this disc, this originally aired as a mini-series on TV.  It has some ""real"" footage mixed in with the CGI destruction but the one thing that is really annoying about this particular movie is the constant zooming in and out of the camera.  It can create some tension in some scenes but the entire thing is shot like this which actually becomes a little distracting.  I wouldn't say it ruins the movie.  Some of the CGI effects are horrible but c'mon it's a made for TV disaster flick.  The pacing is a little strange and they really try to build the stories in the first part of this movie while the second part really focuses on the destruction of the upcoming 10.5.The story is about a series of earthquakes that threaten the entire west coast.  The film starts in Seattle where a 7.1 destroys the Space Needle and other structures nearby which sets off a series of larger and larger earthquakes.  While the science behind this movie is probably false, that doesn't matter when you are watching a disaster movie!  Suspend your intelligence and just get some popcorn and enjoy the destruction.The acting is passable, neither terrific or horrible but I personally thought Beau Bridges really comes off well as the President.This was directed by John Lafia of Child's Play fame so there is some good pacing and some tension building up to the climax.  I would give it *** stars out of 5.  Not bad but not great.Category 6 - Day of Destruction - This was also a mini-series on TV but boy does this one deliver.  I ended up watching the whole thing in one sitting (approximately 3 hours).  The pacing is non stop, unlike other disaster films, usually there is a long character development portion and this movie really doesn't waste time doing that.  They jump right in to the action.  The first scene of Las Vegas being devastated by tornadoes is pretty convincing and the CGI is relatively well done.The plot revolves around two massive storm systems coming together over Chicago, from the South a series of tornadoes and from the North a hurricane?!?  Huh?  Whatever, it's all in the name of destruction!  The more the better in this type of film I say!  There are some shots of ""real"" footage thrown in mixed with the CGI effects but this really isn't too distracting.  The science in this one, questionable but again who cares, this is a popcorn movie and the tension in it really mounts as the storm approaches.The acting in this movie is pretty good for this type of picture, occasionally over the top but not so much so that it's distracting.  I really found this to be a fun flick and more entertaining than 10.5.  Fast pacing and great camerawork really helped this one excel.  ****1/2 stars out of 5.",10.5 / Category 6

It's incredibly hard for me to take a film seriously when Wilt Chamberlain is in it. Anyway, I thought Conan the Destroyer was slightly better than the original because it was shorter, somewhat less boring, and more passable. The acting was not bad, but it wasn't great. The subplots were wafer-thin because when one was initiated, it got dropped later. A good example is the ""ending"". It wasn't an ending at all; just a continuum. Thank goodness, there was no third part. Had Malak (played by Tracey Walter) be cut out of the film entirely, Conan the Destroyer would have had a better rating. He was so despicably annoying and hated. Also, cut Grace Jones please. Cut Wilt Chamberlain. Cut Olivia d'Abo. Man, what a lousy cast. A couple of redeeming qualities about Conan the Destroyer is the custom and set designs. I thought they were very good and deserving of merits. Poor dialogue wrecked havoc on the film as whole.

1182196,"24 may be one of the best tv shows of all time.  This is a good story taken from the series and put into a movie format and I enjoyed it.  It's not as good as the series; but should be seen as a story about Jack bauer and not a 24 serial.  On that level I think that any fan of the series should find enjoyment with this movie. Most importantly it's the direct prequel to season 7 and this movie was originally planned to be part of the 24 series with 12 hours taking place in africa then the next in the U.S.This just didn't work out and so we got this movie which introduces us the characters of the next series. So fans of the series need to see this BEFORE series seven; but even nonfans can enjoy the story and acting in this film. It's not a action fest though which upset some 24 fans , however if they just think of this as a insight into the next series (7) then they should enjoy it much more.  Plus we get a insight into the way warriors can deal with the things they have done via Jack Bauer and the character of Benton played by Robert Carlyle.

367986,"*** This review contains spoilers ***The bulk of 'Belle Epoque' is supposed to be a pastoral romance, a farce of sorts despite being set during the heady eve of the Spanish Civil War in 1931. The film begins inappropriately with our protagonist, Fernando, an army deserter, having just been taken into custody by two officers of the Civil Guard who happen to be father and son-in-law. The father-in-law wants to let Fernando go but the son-in-law, a Nationalist, can't stomach the idea of allowing a 'traitor' to walk free so impulsively he shoots his father-in-law to death but realizing he'll have to face his wife later on and tell her that he's responsible for killing her father, ends up killing himself. Not a very good idea to start off with such an unpleasant scene when most of your story is supposed to be comic in tone.Fernando arrives in a village and seeks to patronize a prostitute at the local brothel. We find out the local priest has no guilt feelings about playing cards with his buddies inside the brothel. There, Fernando meets one of the priest's fellow card players, Manolo, a retired artist, who invites him to stay at his house. Like most people in the village, Manolo is decidedly pro-Republican and is thoroughly tolerant of alternative lifestyles. Fernando is about to return to Madrid but changes his mind when Manolo's four daughters arrive by train.Since this is a farce, we're supposed to suspend our disbelief when each of the four daughters falls for the rather passive Fernando with the libertine Manolo encouraging the randy Lothario as he beds each woman.One of the daughters, Violeta, is an independent woman who works as a veterinarian and also happens to be a lesbian. When the daughters dress Fernando up as a maid for a costume party at a local carnival, Violeta dresses herself up in Fernando's army uniform and then ends up having sex with him inside a barn at the carnival. In a scene more titillating than erotic, Fernando passively lies underneath in his maid's costume as Violeta makes love to him on top. The next day, Fernando informs Manolo of the encounter and he's overjoyed that his daughter now has shown an interest in men. Violeta squelches any possibilities that she has an interest in the opposite sex and makes it clear to her father that in effect the previous night's encounter was simply 'role-playing' and she really has no interest in Fernando.Despite her great attraction to Fernando, Rocio, another one of Manolo's daughters, has been involved with Juanito, a son of a wealthy Royalist widow, who has difficulty escaping the clutches of his control freak mother. There are some rather unfunny scenes with the mother going after Rocio and Juanito even goes so far as to demand that he be excommunicated from the church by the local priest in order to prove to Rocio he's no longer a mamma's boy. At the same time, Rocio strings Juanito along but eventually realizes that they were made for each other and end up marrying.Fernando also tries to prove his mettle with Clara, who lost her husband a year before in a drowning accident. The film's scenarists try to extract some humor in a reference to the deceased husband's last meal. Clara mentions that he loved rice and her sister states it was the only dish he knew how to cook. Clara then lamely replies, ""I know"". Clara becomes so confused over her feelings for Fernando, that she ends up pushing him into the river, in the same spot where her ex-husband drowned. Fernando contracts pneumonia and the daughters then have to attend to him to ensure that he recovers.The last daughter, Luz (played by Penelope Cruz), is perhaps the least interesting of the four daughters. She's simply childish and is jealous of her three sisters who have already become involved with Fernando. I'm not sure exactly why Fernando ends up with Luz (perhaps he feels sorry for her) but the young couple are seen leaving for America at film's end.In addition to the sour note of the murder/suicide at the start of the film, there's also another unsavory moment when the priest kills himself after he feels betrayed by his hero, poet/philosopher Miguel de Unamono, who for a short while supported Franco and the Nationalists.Belle Epoque fails not only for its two brief unnecessary forays into tragedy (the death of the Civil Guards and the Priest suicide) but because the principal characters are decidedly superficial and hence inconsequential. Violeta is basically mean-spirited (recall her unchivalrous tirade after Fernando informs her father of their fling); Rocio is a shallow coquette in regards to her relationship with Juanito, the foolish Clara is disconnected, unable to truly grieve over her lost husband and Luz is simply an immature adolescent. As for Fernando, his behavior with the four daughters speaks for itself!Only Manolo, the intuitive libertine, comes across as somewhat multi-dimensional character. He's seen as particularly likable when he's willing to accept his opera singer wife's manager who he's quite aware has been involved with her while they've been on tour. Manolo is also a philosopher--I particularly liked when he reads a sensual passage from the 'The Magic Mountain' and concludes with the line: ""What youth!"".As a point of comparison, there's a British/Irish film made in 2000 entitled 'About Adam' which has a very similar storyline to Belle Epoque. A young Lothario ingratiates his way into a household consisting mainly of women who have become besotted with him. Both are farcical in tone but 'Adam' manages to exude a slight bit more charm than the specious 'Epoque'.'Belle' is the perfect kind of mediocre film which you would expect would win an Oscar for Best Foreign Language feature. It was safe and offended no one which guaranteed all the awards and accolades it managed to garner.",N/A

1293240,"Sometimes karma can be a real b***h.  Take Ryan Bingham, who works for a company that specializes in firing other companies' employees.  Yet, despite the harshness of what he's paid to do, Ryan genuinely loves his job and the confirmed-bachelor lifestyle it allows him to lead.  He loves being away from home 270 days out of the year.  He loves flying on planes - to the point where he's about to crack the magical 10 million-mile mark on his Frequent Flyer plan.  He even loves the place he officially calls home: a sterile motel room in Omaha where he barely gets time to shower and shave and unpack his bags before heading off to another destination.The problem is that all these business trips are placing an onerous financial burden on the company.  The solution the bigwigs have come up with is to simply remove the human-contact element from the firing process altogether and replace it with the impersonality of the dreaded teleconference.  For Ryan, this means that his days of flying the friendly skies may well be numbered.  Before that happens, however, Ryan is determined to make one last stand with his boss, agreeing to take Natalie Keener, the young woman who came up with the idea, on the road with him to demonstrate just how crucially important the ""personal-touch"" can be when terminating an employee.  Meanwhile, despite his avowals about how much he loves the bachelor life, a crack in his armor may be starting to show, for Ryan may in fact be falling for Alex, a 30-something fellow-traveler he meets in a bar one night and with whom he begins an initially ""casual,"" typically no-strings-attached romance.  But will it stay that way?""Up in the Air"" is the latest work by Jason Reitman, the director who gave us ""Thank You for Smoking"" and ""Juno"" in recent years.  Like those earlier efforts, ""Up in the Air"" is a subtle, thought-provoking comedy/drama that explores not only the complexities of romance and human relationships but the destructive effect rampant corporate downsizing has on the shell-shocked individuals who are its victims and on the fabric of society as a whole.Reitman is scrupulously evenhanded in his depiction of the protagonist.  Ryan may not crave an ongoing relationship with that one ""special"" individual, but he doesn't inflict his values on other people and doesn't expect everyone to agree with how he lives his life.  For Ryan, living alone is simply a lifestyle choice that seems to be working for him.  He isn't even particularly callous in the way he treats those he's in the process of lowering the employment-ending boom on.  Ryan knows that someone has to do his job and it might as well be him.  It certainly beats doing it in the new highly impersonal way Natalie has come up with.  The cosmic question becomes is Ryan's eternal bachelor mindset truly endemic to his personality, or could he find true happiness with another person if he just gave it the old college try?Reitman's wryly humorous screenplay (co-authored with Sheldon Turner and based on the book by Walter Kim) explores Ryan's relationship - one platonic, the other not - with two women:  the brash but actually quite nave Natalie who, despite her seeming emotional detachment, believes in happily-ever-after storybook endings and long-term marital bliss, and the more seasoned Alex who has few illusions about what life has to offer in either of those two regards.  The movie hears out all sides on the issue without casting judgment and without settling for easy answers.  For that very reason, the movie also earns points for refusing to cater to the audience's expectations for a stereotypical, copout ending.As Ryan, George Clooney really makes his rugged good looks and laid back charm work for him in this role, and Anna Kendrick and Vera Farmiga, as the two women in his life, match him every step of the way in their performances.Given the hard economic times in which we live, ""Up in the Air"" could not be more topical in its treatment of unemployment and the devastating effect it has on the people who suffer the ravages of it.  The movie may not blow you away as other social dramas do, but it will get you to thinking about your own life - and provide you with a few good laughs to lighten the load.",N/A

You don't just watch this movie--you feel it, right in the heart, unlike so many empty 'rom-coms' of today.I'm so pleased with these new Warner Archives releases (this is my 2nd purchase from that particular imprint, the other being the wonderful, overlooked ""The Fox""--also starring Sandy Dennis).  This is a pristine print of the film, the soundtrack is amazingly crisp, and the dialogue comes through clear as a bell.  I am so happy to finally own this film--and in such great condition--for myself, forever.I remember crying when first watching this as a child when it came out in movie theaters, and last night it got me again--I was sobbing for a good long time after the movie ended.  So very touching and unforgettable.  One of the few films that, for me, had a real feel for the actual experience of love and loss. A great, timeless film that still packs an emotional wallop.

1195234,"I can't say I was expecting much from this movie, but Wolfman disappointed. It comes across as a B-monster movie rather than something more. The focus is definitely on a monster killing people. The movie goes to pains to find odd and grotesque situations in which to disembowel a lot of people. However, this gets pretty boring. The scenes are uniformly dark and the acting dull. Simon Merrells is catatonic and Anthony Hopkins comes across as a joke.

1194711,"Liam Neeson shares a trait that all great actors possess - they can do something completely ridiculous and remain entirely believable.  If you're watching Patrick Stewart play Jean-Luc Picard on ""Star Trek - Next Generation,"" you're watching an actual Star Fleet captain rather than a ham actor over-acting on a cheesy set.  If you're watching Sigourney Weaver in ""Alien,"" you're watching Ripley take on the universe's most dangerous monster rather than an actress dancing with a rubber suit.  If you're watching Meryl Streep in ""The Devil Wears Prada,"" you're watching an egotistical editor of a fashion magazine, not a drama queen emoting for effect.From ""Darkman"" to ""Star Wars"" to ""Taken,"" Neeson has always remained believable and compelling no matter how ridiculous his surroundings or god-awful the dialogue.In ""Taken,"" we have to believe that Bryan Mills (Neeson) is a lethal espionage/security guy, one of the best in the world, whose dedication to the job cost him his family.  Too late, he realized his error and quit so he can live in unemployed drudgery and snatch a few moments here and there with his cherished daughter, Kim (Maggie Grace).  Bryan's ex, Lenore (Famke Jannsen, in a thankless role), has custody of Kim and has remarried a sugar daddy who is actually a better person than Lenore.  Kim desperately pleads with Bryan to let her go to Paris with her friend Amanda to tour museums.  Bryan reluctantly consents, going against his better instincts that his 17-year old baby is going to a dangerous place and is not ready for it.Unfortunately, Bryan is right - within minutes of landing in Paris, things go horribly, horribly wrong.  If you saw the trailer for ""Taken,"" you know that the movie is about Bryan's hunt for Kim across the Parisian underworld.This is where ""Taken"" takes flight in a ""Bourne Ultimatum"" kind of way.  There is virtually no character development - the question is whose arm Bryan will break (or worse) as he hunts for his daughter, and how efficiently he'll do it.  Like Jason Bourne, Bryan Mills is not an acrobatic martial artist who will jump, twirl, and kick for dramatic effect - he'll rip your ears off and snap your legs with economic fury.  He's not doing it to be cool.  He's doing what he needs to do to get his daughter back.Woe betide any man or woman who gets in his way.  ""Taken"" strings together a preposterous chain of events that could never happen in a gazillion years, but you won't have time to figure that out until after the movie is over.  For 90-odd minutes, you'll be taken on a compelling thrill ride, courtesy of Neeson and team.Full disclosure - while this movie owes an obvious debt to the ""Bourne"" franchise as far as the feel and look of the film is concerned, it is considerably darker in both subject matter and tone.  This is far from a feel-good movie - you get the sense there are no winners here.",Taken
356016,"V: THE ORIGINAL TV MINISERIES is now and will always be a landmark in television science fiction.  The recent airings of the two miniseries on the SyFy Channel finally goaded me into buying a DVD copy for myself.  I was not disappointed.  Producer, writer, and director Kenneth Johnson had almost complete control over this production.  The quality shows through with a good story, fluid camera work, thrifty film editing, and symbolism throughout the film.  Even better is Kenneth Johnson's director commentary as a special features option.  Johnson narrates from beginning to end.  His dialogue is tied to the scenes at hand and is a virtual cornucopia of behind the scenes production information, trivia, and memories verbalized as clearly as if the film production concluded only yesterday.  Johnson's explanation of film techniques alone almost seems to constitute a semester's worth of a film production class.Overall a first rate production.The plot for those who care to read it again: A seemingly humanoid race arrives on Earth with dozens of enormous mother ships Earth to assist mankind.  All they ask in return is the ability to process synthetic chemicals to bring back to their planet.  Quickly however the Visitors, as they are known, facilitate social unrest that is wholesale blamed on those employed in the science profession.  Scientists are blamed for attempting to derail the Visitor's goodwill, open acts of sabotage, and are linked to an alleged world-wide conspiracy to withhold medical cures purely for the sake of extorting research funds.  As such scientists are treated in much the way the Jewish population faired during the Holocaust.  In the meantime people continue to disappear without a trace much like the Nacht and Nebel degrees of Nazi Germany.  The Visitors even supplement their ranks with human volunteers in local Visitor militia groups much like storm troopers of the 1930's. The Visitors, having taken world leaders into their protective custody, enforce martial law.All is not lost as a brave band of resistance fighters, led by Julie Parrish and Mike Donovan, methodically assemble a force to fight the visitors.  Mike Donovan, formerly one of the news cameramen welcomed by the Visitors, has seen the Visitors in their true reptilian form.  He quickly discovers that the aim of the Visitors is to rob the Earth of its water and enslave the population.  Humans are primed by the Visitors as potential impressed soldiers for the leader's army, as well as a source of food for the Visitors.  The resistance is not alone in its struggle as there are a handful of aliens who do not support their leader's aims.The first miniseries concludes with the resistance having emerged victorious from a nominal battle and preparing for the next engagement.The mini series moves along smartly.  There is no useless dialogue or prolonged scenes to overly exhibit expensive sets.  Much as I enjoyed V: THE FINAL BATTLE I readily admit that the original television series is far superior.  THE FINAL BATTLE picked up where the first series left off, but quickly devolved into a more drawn out production.  Lacking Kenneth Johnson at the helm and a reduced budget, the second mini series lacked the creative camera work, superb editing, and tight dialogue of the original.  Kenneth Johnson pitched a sequel that would have ignored the second mini-series and weekly television production, but Warner Brothers (who own the television rights to the series) opted to remake the series for ABC.  Johnson's sequel eventually ended up as a book.For reasons that still escape me I missed the original May 1983 broadcast of V.  I did not become a fan of the series until early 1984 when I saw V: THE FINAL BATTLE and was later able to watch a summer rebroadcast of both mini series prior to the airing of the weekly television series.  Much as I admired both mini series and the television show, I admit that I always felt THE FINAL BATTLE's ending was rushed.  The instant resolution with the simple release of red dust was too hurried and not in keeping with the original mini series.Ultimately V: THE ORIGINAL TV MINISERIES is a superior effort.  I recommend that after you watch the film that you watch it again with Kenneth Johnson's commentary.",V - The Original TV Miniseries VHS

1040028,"I must admit that I'm very fond of the original American title for the Korean horror film ""Bloody Reunion.""  The deeply ironic ""To Sir With Love"" is not only a delightfully kitschy homage to the Sidney Poitier up-with-teachers classic, but a wickedly perverse thwarting of expectations!  Taking its cues from the slasher genre, ""Bloody Reunion"" is a deft, creative, and surprising film.""Bloody Reunion"" is staged in a remote country cottage.  Former students come to pay their respects to a teacher who is now in the last stages of her life.  From this celebratory event, a darkness starts to reveal itself.  Past grudges re-surface and confrontations are forced changing the idyllic party into an open forum catharsis of the demons that have haunted them all collectively and individually.  It seems the teacher may not have been the perfect role model--in fact, she kept her own son, deformed since birth, locked up in the basement during his formative years.  As the drama escalates, so does the body count.  From the character introductions to the way the students are colorfully dispatched, you might think this is a by-the-numbers presentation of slasher carnage.  But ""Bloody Reunion"" still has some refreshing surprises up its sleeve (but I won't go any further in my description).  What has been a fun, but slight, entertainment ultimately reveals itself to be quite a good film in its own right!There are several aspects that push ""Bloody Reunion"" ahead of the pack.  First, the performances were absolutely terrific.  Even within the limitations of ""character types,"" the actors really had opportunities to shine.  Their pain and anger and regret is palpable and heartfelt, and I fell for the genuine emotion quite wholeheartedly.  Even at the end, where the antics are at a fever pitch--I thought the actors remained quite true.  Second, the murders are pleasantly gruesome and ingenious.  And third, the film's final reveal packs quite a wallop.  A truly entertaining set-up that just grows deeper and more interesting, ""Bloody Reunion"" is definitely worth a look.  And not even a spot of black vomit or a black haired ghost girl in sight like almost every other Asian horror film on the market!  That's a big plus.  KGHarris, 10/10.",Bloody Reunion

332028,"I have loved science fiction and fantasy since I was two years old. When I was 11 years old I tried to watch 2001 A Space Odyssey, and it is the only science fiction film I never finished watching as a little girl, the movie just got to boring, and that is saying something as I ate up anything with space ships. However now an adult woman of 28 years I decided to give this movie another watch, thinking that I was probably to young to get it when I first tried to sit down and see it. So last night me and my hubby sat down with 2001 on blu-ray.I have to say that I have mixed feelings about this movie. Let me take the good first. When you take into account that this movie was made in 1968 the special effects are amazing, the space station, the space ships, the spinning interior of the main ship, all of it is just amazing, the effects even hold up today, they are just beautifully done. The movie is set to a score made up mostly off classical music and that all combine to create a beautiful film.The story is very original and it is more than a simple let us go out in space and look for aliens tale, the film is deeply philosophical. I could not really give you a summary of the film without spoiling it, and it is really more about the journey, you would have to experience the story for yourself. The characters are very well done and feel very real, and off course you have Hal, perhaps the most iconic AI character off all time. This is both a classical science fiction space tale, and a philosophical discussion about evolution, morality and even God.Ok now to the bad. Some scenes go on forever. There are several space docking sequences which take many minutes to complete, the whole first of the movie is composed of men in monkey suits dancing around that that just go on forever and at the end of the movie there are a nearly 20 minuted acid trip which is nothing but lights and sounds swirling around. I lost patience with the film and stopped caring about the plot, there is a limit to how long I find it interesting to watch swirling lights or a pen floating in zero G.Another problem with 2001 is that allot of time is spent with a scientist, we learn that he has a daughter he is estranged to, his character is really developed, and then he is just discarded and never seen again, a third problem with the movie is that it was made alongside a novel and without it there are things which are really hard to understand.I have one big issue with the blu-ray as well. In the middle of the movie there is a five minutes section where the screen go dark and there are just music playing. This was when the movie took a break in the theater so people could go buy more popcorn. However why keep this in the blu-ray, that long part where the screen is black should have been cut.I can not be to hard on this film as it is a classic, and it is a masterpiece. The visuals are amazing, and the movie do make you think. The film should have been shorter, it is not a film to watch if you do not have allot of patience. Also if you expect traditional science fiction you will not get it here. However if you are looking for an art film with a plot then this might just be the movie for you.",N/A
1390304,"This is a fabulous concert, and though it leans towards Latin music, there is plenty to admire, enjoy, and love.  Dudamel is definitely a ""hot conductor"" in that he seems to become himself electrified by the music he's performing.  His conducting of the Rossini ""Semiramide"" overture is electrifying.  There are moments when he just ""stands there"", smiling at the music he's getting his fabulous orchestra to perform.  Moreover, there are some wonderful ""close-ups"" of the strings, piccolos, etc, as they burrow through the incredibly taxing measures of the rather longish overture.  This musicians are something to behold.  The DVD is enhanced by the panning of the players.  Ditto for the Latin orchestral numbers as well.  Dudamel certainly knows how to ""turn on"" his orchestra.  The results are stunning to the ear.Of Juan Diego Florez, what can one say?  The guy is the greatest and most astonishing tenor in this repertoire known to me.  To compare any previous competitors is a waste of time.  His two Rossini arias, one from ""Cenerentola"" and the other from ""Semiramide"" (a really fiendish piece of vocal music requiring coloratura cadenzas and repetitions, is enough to astonish you.  His singing of such latin songs as ""Granada"", as well as other Latin favorites, are balm for the ears.  Moreover, he gives two incredible encores ==== the ""Ah, mez amis"" from Donizetti's ""La Fille de Regiment"" (one of his ""hit arias) with those nine incredible high C's, as well as The Djuke's ""La Donna de Mobile"" from Rigoletto"", to which he adds a few extra ""grace notes"" gliding over the music as though he were a champion ice skater, and his climatic top C seems to last forever.It's incredibly rich musical evening, and each selection is prefaced by an explanation of the music beforehand.  It's a jewel of a concert, and the audience obviously realized that it was getting it's money's worth and then some.  Heartily recommended to all who love this wonderful music.  The Dudamel/Florez combo is truly an amazing musical experience.  For those who love Florez, this DVD is a must.",N/A

Further, Catholicism is depicted as the religion for those who suffer from a massive and morbid guilt complex - surely this was not the main theme of the book?

1309843,"This is a good movie to watch if you enjoy history (reminded me of the way the show Tudors is done) and want to see some fantastic acting. Don't expect many chuckles until the middle. If you're looking for the actual robbing the rich story then you're out of luck as this is literally a movie about Robin's life BEFORE the forest.Things I liked:*Acting- From the children and extras to the A-list actors, all who had a role in this film were superb.*History- It wasn't a movie where they just dressed the part and spoke with silly accents. It's obvious when watching that they tried to remain as faithful to history as they could in all areas of clothing, scenery, language, dates, etc.*Tone- This wasn't a Disney portrayal. I half expected Robin to be lighthearted, mischievous, and arrogant running around stealing from the wealthy and living a grand life in the forest. This version had a dark and dreary tone which matched the mood and events of the time.*Action- They made Robin and the other archers good at what they did while still being human (unlike the fancy tricks performed by Legolas in Lord of the Rings).Things I did not like:*Action- The version I watched was the director's cut so perhaps it was longer than the theatrical version? In any case the beach scene in the end was just too long. By the time all the soldiers were united you already knew they would outnumber and win over the french.*The Beginning- Again, maybe it has something to do with being the director's cut but the first hour was a complete drag. I was so bored and I kept saying to myself ""why did I waste my money on this movie."" I was literally about to turn it off but Robin reached Nottingham and the movie FINALLY became good. I nearly missed out on a great movie because of the drawn out boring first hour.",N/A

525700,"So as is often the case, this movie isn't as good as the book, but it is still a must buy for the DVD collection. I watched it again recently and was surprised just how young the actors are in this film, compared to later films. They really do a great job and the director is reasonably true to the book. I'm still not convinced Harry potter is actually a kids movie. I think I would have been freaked out as a child. However this first movie is pretty slow moving and has loads of lovely scenes and ideas that kids will just love. Be warned it does get scary in patches.This is a great introduction to the land of magic. We meet Professor Dumbledore, Hagrid, Harry Potter (and his Muggle family), all within the opening minutes; And of course Ron Weasley and Hermione Granger aren't too far behind once Harry gets to Hogwarts. The magic of the first book is brought to life in this first movie, and the best thing I think about it is that it is virtually stand-alone. No previous knowledge is required and nothing but a vivid imagination is needed. It is exactly the sort of movie I would have enjoyed watching as a kid, and it has the same appeal to me today as Disneyland does.",N/A
1311341,"All of the trailers and TV spots have given people the idea that The Expendables  unites as many of the biggest action film stars in one film and promises to be one of the bloodiest and explosive films in recent memory. So to expect strong writing or a coherent story in a film like this would just be absurd, so I thought that expecting an entertaining action film and nothing more would fit the mold perfectly. Somehow the film still managed to be an out of control mess.The writing was cringe-worthy. It felt like we were thrown into a film that had already established a back story, but maybe that's what they were going for since most of these actors have action films that they're associated with. The dialogue will probably make you groan at how corny it is at times. If Mickey Rourke's speech about putting a Charlotte's Web tattoo on Jason Statham's ""perfect, round head"" wasn't improvised, then that is really disappointing as Rourke seemed to struggle on spitting the words out during that scene. The Expendables certainly felt like it filmed all the big action sequences first and then tried to throw together a script and a story at the last minute. One of the most humorous aspects of the film was the fact that it had to make a big deal about Steve Austin's character not having any objections to roughing up women when he was accused of abusing them in real life.With this many stars in the film, you can probably guess that it isn't very well balanced. Getting all of these action stars in one film is certainly an achievement, but most of them don't have much screen time. The first half of the film seems to be very Jason Statham heavy while the rest of the film is mostly Stallone. Jet Li and Mickey Rourke have a few scenes where they stick out while Dolph Lundgren seems to sit on the sidelines for most of the film. If you're going into this film expecting a larger role from someone who isn't in this paragraph, then you'll probably be disappointed due to how small their role really is.The film is capable of delivering some bone-crunching and blood soaked fight sequences in addition to an incredible amount of explosions that would even make Michael Bay contemplate whether or not he's had this much destruction in one film. Some of the ways that people die in the film are gloriously gruesome while the film shines brightest during the scenes where Barney's team is too busy fighting to say much of anything. Most of the action scenes in Vilena, the car chase that ends with the fight between Jet Li and Dolph Lundgren, and the finale of the film are all deliciously explosive, fast paced, and hit hard enough to satisfy most action film fans.The Expendables is poorly written and rather brainless, but is capable of giving its audience exactly what it advertised and that's deliver one of the loudest action films ever that features quite possibly the greatest gathering of action stars in any film. If you're somehow able to ignore the disconnected storyline and stupefyingly simple dialogue, then you'll probably be able to enjoy the clutter of explosive and fast paced action.",N/A
1354957,"I have never written a review after having been an Amazon customer for over 8 years now at least, however, after seeing the dreadful amount of reviews for the movie, I had to make sure I gave it a 5 star review.  I consider myself a ""Christmas Carol"" movie buff (of my own making of course), and this version is so close to perfect that it deserves the highest of all reviews.  For those who say that this was meant to be an uplifting story and is too 'scary', I suppose you have never taken the time to read the book.  It is a story of redemption, and of turning a miserable miser into a completely uplifted new man.  A man that was given a second chance at life...and I am sorry, but it would have sickened me to see them portray this otherwise.  In order for man to change, they must see their wrongs and the repercussions that will happen if life is continued being lived without care of others, and this is exactly what Dicken's was portraying, and what the movie came across as. To see it all 'fluffed' up and 'Disney'd' up would just be ridiculing what Dicken's was trying to prove.  I personally love the version with George C. Scott, as well as the classic with Alastair Sim, but when I saw this first last year, I knew that there was a new classic.  All the parts, minor as they may be, that have been left out of previous versions were included, and I thought that this movie hit the book to the 't' and am so glad to have this movie to pass down to others, to show what the book was truly supposed to be like when coming to life in Hollywood.  For those who feel it is too scary, I suggest you show your children Sesame Street or something of the like, because I hate to be the bearer of bad news, but guess what?  Life is not always good, sometimes it can be downright harsh....and this movie put to life what happens when a man who has been a terrible person both inside his heart and out gets a chance at redemption...a second chance to live, and if this is not something your children may understand at their young age, then you may want to just put this on the shelf for a few more years until they realize that life is not full of marshmallows and happiness 24 hours a day....otherwise, sit down and enjoy the movie of a lifetime!",Disney's A Christmas Carol

1259143,"First, the good news: In Merlin and the Book of Beasts, Merlin does indeed make an appearance, as does the aforementioned book.Now for the bad news.  Merlin (James Callis) adopts a thickly accented Welsh dialect that is as irritating as it is undecipherable. Fans of Battlestar Galactica who are familiar with Callis' pleasant inflection will find no solace here. It seems Callis wanted to take on an eccentric role, and he does so with gusto.The Book of Beasts isn't precisely the Monster Manual one might expect from a fantasy-themed movie. It starts with killer butterflies (ooh, scary!), moves to ""dragon knights"" which are basically giant zombies, some giant birds that are only heard off-screen (maybe they're griffons?), and then there's the Gorgons.What?  You thought this was a movie about medieval times?  Well you can forget it, because The Book of Beasts is one sandal away from Clash of the Titans.  The Gorgons themselves are here in all their glory; beautiful until angered, whereupon they turn into snake-haired harpies.  The Arkadian who summons them (Jim Thorburn) has a dark secret, but mostly he runs out of ideas and decides to stick with his highest-level monster.So the Gorgons take up most of the movie, more than the archvillain himself. Throughout the film is another plot about how Sir Galahad (Donald Adams) is leading the return of the next generation of knights, including King Arthur's progeny Avlynn (Laura Harris). But really this is about Gorgons turning people into statues, seducing men, and hissing a lot.Book of Beasts aims high and fails to achieve its lofty goal as a sort of sequel to the Arthurian myth. The special effects are used wisely to portray the monsters, but there simply isn't enough variety to make for much of a book.",Merlin & The Book Of Beasts

58618,"My sister and I watched this movie for the first time last night on cable. I had heard of it since its debut in 1997, but never taken the time to watch it. I had been avoiding it, to be honest. I assumed it was a film which was making a mockery of Christianity. However, I was very, very wrong.""The Apostle"" is one of the the best films I have seen. When I started watching it, I thought I might be disappointed. I was not. I have enjoyed the other films I have seen Robert Duvall in, but this was his best performance of all. He brilliantly captured the part of the the charismatic, Southern preacher. I have seen preachers like that in person, and there were times we felt were in church, or seeing them on television. We had to remember we were watching a movie.The thing about this film that appeals to me most is how Sonny is a man who really loves the Lord. However, he is not perfect, nor does he pretend to be. So many of we Christians can be so arrogant, thinking we are above everyone else, it is an annoying turn-off. He has cheated on his wife, and kills her lover by beating him with a baseball bat in a fit of anger. He is kicked out of his church. He even lashes out at God when his wife leaves him. It is a very realistic portrayal of a man who has deeply rooted issues, yet at the same time, he is still a Christian. It shows you do not have to be perfect to serve God, and to love Him. This movie does not belittle or disrespect Christianity. It makes it real and honest.After Sonny's attack on his wife's lover, he flees to a small town in Louisiana, where he decides to start his life over. He baptizes himself again, declares himself an apostle, and takes on the name ""The Apostle E.F."" He founds a new church, which starts off very small, then quickly grows into a larger, racially-diverse congregation. It is a close-knit group. Unfortunately, Sonny's ex-wife hears him on the radio, and contacts the local authorities. One night, after a touching, uplifting sermon, he is arrested for murder. He embraces some of the members, as they sing. He then walks out of the church, and surrenders to the police, relinquishing his jewelry to be sold for the benefit of the church. In prison, he is still preaching the gospel, and influencing the other inmates.The rest of the cast includes Farrah Fawcett, as Sonny's ex-wife Jessie, June Carter-Cash as Sonny's mother, John Beasley as Brother C. Charles Blackwell, the man he builds his new church with, and Billy Bob Thornton as a racist troublemaker who initially comes to the church to start trouble, but is converted by Sonny in the end.I have quite a few favorite movies.

1213811,"It seems false to say that ""Hunger"" dramatizes the events surrounding the hunger strike of Irish Republican Bobby Sands in the Maze Prison that made news around the world in 1981. Steve McQueen's film does not so much dramatize the bizarre conditions and battle of wills inside the Maze as it shows them to us. ""Hunger"" is a film of images with very little dialogue. It's fantastically cinematic, until, about halfway through, it is interrupted by a 22 minute conversation between Sands (Michael Fassbender) and Catholic priest Father Dominic Moran (Liam Cunningham) in which the IRA radical and the moderate Catholic lay out their conflicting views of how Irish Republicans should proceed. An almost entirely aural experience in the middle of a highly visual film.By 1981, over 2,000 people had been killed in ""The Troubles"" in Northern Ireland, as republicans and unionists battled over the future of British rule, and the British tried to keep the peace while tending to support the unionists. The Maze prison housed 75 IRA militants who were convicted of crimes. When we enter the prison in 1981, they're on a ""blanket"" and ""no wash"" strike. They refuse to wear prison uniforms, so they go naked except for a blanket, and they refuse to bathe or cut their hair. They smear excrement all over their cell walls and destroy their accommodations as best they can to protest their status as prisoners, while the prison officers are forced to cope with this situation with varying degrees of passivity and force.""Hunger"" doesn't give much hint of why the prisoners are protesting or what they hope to achieve with these actions or with the later hunger strikes. (They were trying to force the British government to recognize them as political prisoners rather than criminals.) Steve McQueen and co-writer Enda Walsh are more concerned with conveying the bizarre circumstances that leads to warped behavior on the part of both prisoners and guards, and its emotional toll. It is startling how clearly smells and tactile sensations come across through the use of images. Close-ups on detail, meticulous production design, and no distracting dialogue are a powerful combination. This sensory experience emphasizes the primitivism to which both sides of the conflict have resorted.Some say the IRA supported the hunger strikes to garner international support and improve their recruiting in Northern Ireland rather than out of concern for the political status of the prisoners. ""Hunger"" doesn't take a stance on British rule, IRA violence, or even whether Bobby Sands and his fellow strikers were delusional pawns or martyrs to a just cause. It contents itself with showing us the strange situation that the politics of Northern Ireland created inside the Maze prison at that time -and the deaths and damage to prisoners and prison officers that resulted. Steve McQueen has admirably combined the sensory impact of photographic art with the humanity that the actors bring to their roles to take the viewer inside a strange and disturbing conflict that played out nearly 30 years ago.The DVD (Criterion Collection 2010): There are 4 featurettes and a theatrical trailer (1  min). ""Steve McQueen"" (17 min) interviews the director about how he uses the camera, contrast between the Maze and normal life, his research, and the film's reception. ""The Making of Hunger"" (14 min) interviews McQueen, writer Enda Walsh, producer Robin Gutch, and the cast. ""Michael Fassbender"" (14 min) is a 2008 interview by film critic Jason Solomons about preparing to play Bobby Sands and making the movie. ""The Provos' Last Card?"" (45 min) is a segment from the BBC news program ""Panorama"" in 1981. Journalist Peter Taylor looks at the political situation in Northern Ireland through interviews with Sinn Fein, Democratic Unionist, and Labour Party leaders, and others. This is helpful in understanding the political situation surrounding the hunger strikes if you are not British or Irish and need some education on the subject.",N/A
1335764,"Our entire family enjoyed 'this movie,' and I found it to be one of the best family movies of all time.The Secrets of Jonathan Sperry takes us back to 1970 when times were simpler, but forever a need to tell others about the saving grace of Jesus Christ. The characters are very likeable and there are humorous parts dotted throughout.  Here is a quick look at the main characters:Dustin is raised by his mom after his father dies. He's thoughtful and kind and always ready to lend a helping hand.Albert is a silly boy who struggles with keeping a tight reign on his tongue. He provides much comedic relief.Mark is the braniac who seems to have knowledge far beyond his years.Nick is a bully who is also being raised by his mom and who has no qualms about picking on Dustin and his friends.We also meet Bailey, a girl whose father owns the cafe and whom Dustin has a crush.Jonathan Sperry is a 75-year-old man who is active in his church and taught Mark's brother in Sunday School. He lives out his faith and allows God to use him to make an impact on the lives around him.One of the things I loved most about Jonathan Sperry's character was that he actively lived out his faith. He wasn't preachy, yet he showed real-life examples for each lesson. I especially loved the lesson where the boys had to reach the $5 bill on the picnic table. The graveyard scene is also a scene full of impact that depicts the urgency in telling others about Christ.Two of the boys in the movie grew up without fathers. What a wonderful example and mentor Jonathan Sperry was especially to those two boys.  This movie had strong themes of redemption, faith, forgiveness, and kindness.This is a heartwarming film for the entire family. While not preachy, it does share an important message. There is also nothing objectionable in the movie, and I highly recommend it!I have added The Secrets of Jonathan Sperry to my Mom-Approved Family Movie list on my blog.

I own a big library of these films on dvd and jugde them for the intertainment they are,not the impact of certain scenes. That being said this movie in my opinion is utterly trash. The violence other reviews talk about is not as grusome or gory as seen in other films(look at any film by lucio fulci and thisll pale in comparison), the revenge part couldve been way better,the 10 min rape scene is nothing to write home about either. it was rather boring to watch and i just sat through it to see what all the fuss was about (yawns). the ONLY possitive side to this whole crap fest is seeing monica belluci nude in a few scenes,and the dress she wares in the rape scene looks hot on her,thats it. glad i rented this on amazon and didnt buy it because i wouldve been real pissed. the later half of the movie,after the rape is so slow and boring i fast forward it to the end just to get through it. save your money,your patience and 2 hrs of your life and skip this one,watch i spit on your grave, much better movie, better revenge, better gore, better rape scene. i would give it 0 stars if amazon would let me.",N/A
1242205,"BEAUTIFUL AND DEADLYI love this film. For me as a viewer of this film , this movie has given Frank Langella god - like powers as an actor. Understandeably , that means bad news for big government and big bussiness who don't like people to have any ideas about the possibility of acquiering god - like powers as a result of encountering totally unforseeable events whom they have no control over. The film deals with three versions of Earth as they exist seperately and yet fully connected with each other in the year 1976. The film provides the ultimate counterargument against why people like to live in little boxes - and shatters any potential box the senses of it's viewer may have encountered in their lives , including and most specifically the box of conspiracy reality. Since I am very used to have my now circle - shaped world - views shattered by the minute , I welcomed this film so much that I watched it two times. The film portrays the possibility that humanity has evolved into a very powerful series of advanced species and civilizations which can possess such powers as the ability to move themselves between planets in the form of lightning. People think it's impossible but H.G.Wells encountered this concept of travel in the form of lightning when he wrote the War of the Worlds. In the War of the Worlds the Martians visited the Earth in the form of lightning as it was seen by Steven Spielberg. Spielberg tried unsuccessfully due to his political views to present his extraterrestrial visitors in a convincing manner but Morgan Freeman saved the day and for me , sort of led the team on that one. In the Box , Frank Langella proves ultimately his enormous success as an actor since his seriously , albeit totally unintentionally , shamanistic approax to interpreting Richard Nixon in the film Nixon /Frost. That was a movie I loved to watch as well. I have watched several other Frank Langella films but until this time I realized that he is seriously interested in playing in only really good movies. So this film will be a kind of Clockwork Orange like cult classic after about 10 years from now. It has already generated some highly politically incorrect ideas on travel in the minds of many. Imagine how easy it'd be once having perfected the technology and skills to create wormholes by the use of your mind and to use them to travel between dimensions in the form of lightning. On the outside you appear as lightning but in front of you is a wormhole. Goodness knows how many visitors from elsewhere may have visited this planet in such a manner. Imagine how easy it'd be for them to possess someone really aware , such as quite terrifyingly , mr. Langella or myself , and use our bodies and ourselves as vehicles without our knowledge. I have a far more terrifying theory as to how such a communication could take place - for example , astrally just as Langella tries to portray somewhere in the middle of the film. 1976 has a particularly significant importance from a symbolic perspective for me for some reason. I have often used this year to express myself artistically to get more people to read my other internet apart from amazon.com views and pay some attention to my art in my country and occasionally to make fun out of new age thought and maoism.What if we could be struck not only by physical lightning such as that portrayed in this film but astral lightning? That'd be seriously politically incorrect for the one or two star reviewers of this film. But perhaps moderate for the three star reviewers. We five star reviewers love and honour and appreciate this movie , Langella for who he is , and Cameron Diaz for who she is , and the director , producers and other actors for who they are , without giving a damn about the consequences. We have no idea as to exactly why we love films like the Box , Solaris , etc. , we just do. Thus , we operate outside of the mainstream to the one and two star reviewers , learn from them , move about our bussiness numinously , and continue to strive toward greatness in the pursuit of our limitless potential. I love how the director of this movie and the Donnie Darko plays with water. I have never seen anybody do it as well as he does since Leonardo Da Vinci. Leonardo would have loved to watch his films. Interestingly like in Leonardo's works , water often has a somewhat apocalyptic message to tell in the film , and also very beautiful - beautiful and deadly. If you who are reading this view happen to be an nsa employee , do not try this at home - if you do , consider yourself warned!! That was of course a joke by the way. Thank you so much , Langella , Diaz and all for having brought me the opportunity to see this film. Without you , I would never have!! Hitchcock would have loved the Box. I wonder if there'll be a sequel in where the main character chooses to destroy the box and present it to Stewart in ruins. Stewart's gonna be soo mad.........or not since he likes mystery.","Box, The (DVD)"

791817,"Four true film noir entries from the golden age of film noir.  Film Noir tended to be more of a ""B"" film with dramatic lighting , story and action.  Often the film used odd angles, misrepresentation of size and other tricks to present another reality that was nightmare based.  Wrong place at the wrong time or a bad choice from temptation are two themes seen in these films. We see human weakness and frailty exploited, savage behavior and the application of sex or greed as motivation to new depths of human desire.  The post WWII world saw how underlying everyday life was evil from the highest penthouse to the lowest alley way.For those of you that don't know, while Casablanca is not truely film noir the excellent films such as the Big Sleep and the Maltese Falcon are Noir but are not as cynical or nightmarish as the later stuff.Personally I'd give Impact 5 stars, KC Confidential 4 stars, Detour 4 stars and DOA 4 stars.  These are all great to watch for post WWII values, fashion, attitudes and vision.  These were not meant to be expensive films but use ingenuity in making them exciting and worthy of seeing.  It is a fine collection to introduce people to film noir.",Film Noir Classics Collection: D.O.A. / Detour / Impact / Kansas City Confidential
129866,"If you're looking to own the complete Indiana Jones saga, this is a good place to start: not only does it include all three of the original '80's movies (1981, 1984, and 1989), but a fourth disc packed with over three hours of bonus material.  The first, defining film, originally titled ""Raiders of the Lost Ark"" (more recent rereleases add Indy's name to the title) is set in 1936 and finds archaeologist, adventurer, and ""obtainer of rare antiquities"" Dr. Indiana Jones approached by two government agents searching for information on the ""headpiece of the Staff of Ra,"" an artifact currently being sought by the Nazis.  Hitler is ""a nut"" on the occult and has agents running all over Europe (and other places) trying to gather up artifacts that may possess unusual powers; they've found the lost city of Tanis, Egypt, where the Hebrew Ark of the Covenant is hidden, but without the headpiece they can't find out exactly where.  So Indy sets out to recover it first, helped by Marion Ravenwood (Karen Allen), his former girlfriend, whose father originally collected it, and Sallah (John Rhys-Davies), the British-educated ""best digger in Cairo.""  Opposing them are Indy's long-time rival Rene Belloq (Paul Freeman), a Nazi spy named Toht (Ronald Lacey), and Col. Dietrich (Wolf Kahler).  But the Ark may not need human help to defend it--and it doesn't like Nazis at all.""Indiana Jones & the Temple of Doom"" is a much darker movie (much asStar Wars, Episode V- The Empire Strikes Back (Widescreen Edition), the middle episode of George Lucas's other famous trilogy, was much darker than either of the other two), set about a year before ""Raiders.""  We find Indy in Shanghai, where an attempt to collect pay due him from local gangster Lao Che (Roy Chiao) throws him and his 10-year-old sidekick Short Round (Ke Huy Quan) together with cabaret singer Willie Scott (Kate Capshaw).  When their plane is forced down over northern India, Indy is asked by the inhabitants of a native village to recover a sacred stone that has been stolen from them by the maharajah of Pankot Palace.  This stone may well be even more powerful than the villagers believe: the theft, it turns out, was engineered by a resurgent cell of Thuggee led by Mola Ram (Amrish Puri), who knows exactly what they're really capable of and plans to use them to rule all India.  When Indy discovers a maze of catacombs deep beneath the palace, a wild adventure ensues full of human sacrifice, enslaved children, and narrow escapes.  In this adventure Indy's character is more mercenary than he seems in the others; the prospect of ""fortune and glory"" excites him even more than finding antiquities (or ""the search for fact,"" as he defines archaeology in ""Last Crusade"").  And many viewers dislike Willie, who spends a lot of time screaming or grousing about the hardships she's subjected to--but it's worth keeping in mind that, unlike Marion, she hasn't spent her life tramping all over the world learning to be tough and self-sufficient.The third episode, ""Indiana Jones & the Last Crusade,"" jumps forward to 1938; Indy receives a strange package in the mail which proves to be the ""Grail diary"" kept for some 35 years by his father, Medieval-history professor Henry Jones (Sean Connery), who has been trying for most of his life to find the Holy Grail.  Soon afterward he's approached by millionaire Walter Donovan (Julian Glover), who has discovered clues to the Grail's location and had Prof. Jones working on the search until he ""disappeared.""  As Indy travels from Venice to Vienna to a hidden temple deep in the Mideastern desert, he not only finds his missing father but discovers plots and betrayals coming thick and fast.  (This may be my favorite of the trilogy: not only is Indy reunited with his friends Marcus Brody (Denholm Elliott) and Sallah, but the quirky relationship between him and his father is wonderfully portrayed.)The bonus material includes trailers for all three movies, featurettes on the stunts, music, sound, and ""light and magic"" (optical and mechanical SFX), and a set of shorts on how the movies were made, with interview appearances by Lucas, Spielberg, John Williams, Connery, Rhys-Davies, Allen, Ke, Ben Burtt, and various other persons important to the realization of the Jones legend.  And although the movies were quite unashamedly made in imitation of the classic 1930's Saturday-afternoon adventure serials, they're no less exciting--and believable--for all that: so well do cast and crew do their work that suspension of disbelief is very easy.  Anyone who loves good old-fashioned adventure should have them on the shelf.",N/A

Aside from being musical, it was funny romantic and serious in certain parts a huge pagage, I am here to say that at that time in the sixties that is how it was excluding the music in the streets, unles it was their holiday. it was run only by the asians..restaurants, police, and so on. to go there was like walking in a different world, a world that i love, and miss going..so yhea unless you was married in the family and you was not an asian whould be the only reason you whould be there. I love all the music sung in this movie..It made me feel happy inside.but that's me, I love romance with a twist. I have seen movies from all the actors after ""FLOWER DRUM SONG"" all have done great movies, but I'm partial to the ladies, they were acting till very old...and still beautifull..still standing tall...YOU GO GIRLS. sadly all the men are gone eccept for the younger ones.

1368170,"Like me many Bionic Woman fans were disappointed in the 2007 remake of the classic series.  This is the real deal. Like HARDY BOYS/NANCY DREW MYSTERIES instead of BIONIC WOMAN season 1 it could almost be called SIX MILLION DOLLAR MAN BIONIC WOMAN show on the box cover.  The first four episodes on disk 1 are SIX MILLION DOLLAR MAN episodes. BIONIC WOMAN from Million Dollar Man season 2 and Return of the Bionic Woman from Six Million Dollar Man season 3.Since Lee Majors series has only been release in Europe and not the states its a wonderful addition to the set. Lee Majors does guest star in several of the Bionic Woman episodes as Lindsay Wagner guest starred in Six Million Dollar Man ones.  Whole Disk 1 seems like one super long movie that pilots the Bionic Woman television series since Jamie Summers don't come to terms with her Bionics till episode 1 of her own series and still keeping her body from rejecting them in the first four episodes.While The Bionic Woman's adventures don't quite live up to those of her military counterpart, Oscar does sent Jamie Summers better missions that mixes counter intelligence spies with home life that was seen in 2007 series. Stories than include illegal government secret trades,  investigates mysteries missile launches, wild safari animal problems, protecting top secret formulas while undercover, entering international auto race to get foreign secrets, espionage in a beauty contest and evil twins.Besides the military missions Jamie uses her bionics to help her around the house, teaching at school and deals with the emotional roller coaster she feels for Major Steve Austin and the death of her parents.The commentary I listen to so far is okay but could be more focus on the events happening within the episodes being viewed and not talking about the series in general.

1229004,"Yes the acting in ""The Reader"" film is superb, the visual scenes perfected to a fault, the ability to expose the raw emotions of guilt and the need in trying to redeem oneself, are all here in this film, but for what purpose?Is this film really trying to show a realistic side to Germany's past or just another movie trying to pull at our emotional strings in an attempt of grasping an Oscar?I may seem cynical, but for me this film too readily glosses over the cruelty that some people perpetrated at this time. The repetitive scenes of perfect gray backgrounds endless shots of pouting by all the characters with somber music to assist in the mood and the classic film filler of smoking a cigarette for dramatic effect of deep contemplation (Freud would say of guilty sexual pleasures) is too scripted for my pallet.I can understand that many people will find this film a profound revelation and/or even a classic representation of flawless acting that achieves a balance of realism seldom found in the Hollywood movie industry.For me however, it loses purpose, by not exposing the ugly side of human nature for which we are all vulnerable to regardless of nationality, faith, or moral upbringing.The film is too self absorbed into the characters of Hanna and Michael's feeling of guilt and shame which makes them come across somewhat pathetic and bland. It overindulges in trying to have us feel sympathetic to the characters plights.Like most people if you like soap operas you will probably love this movie. If not, you may find this film a bit staged and historically compromised to appease the Oscar Gods.",N/A
340149,"THE BELLS OF ST. MARY'S was a rarity at the time: a true feature-length sequel. The story picks up exactly where we left off at the end ofGOING MY WAY(1944), with Father O'Malley's arrival at his new parish. The initial humor, some business with a kitten in O'Malley's hat, vanishes as fast as the cats do.Then we have a boy whose face was pounded by a bully, all for the sake of Mother Sister Benedict's advice to ""turn the other cheek."" The sequence of a guilt-ridden nun trying to teach young Eddie to box plays poorly, like a Mama's boy sparring in the kitchen with mother just before he dries the dishes.The main flaw is, O'Malley, who's just a garrulous regular Joe with a collar, has no real male friends, no monsignor's shared drink from a secret book, no best buddy to shoot a stolen round of golf with. He's reduced to observing the nuns and kids with detached amusement and staying out of the way. Or so it seems to me.The troubled girl with a single mom doesn't work as well as street kids that are organized into a choir in the first film, there's no truly great music to savor, like the Carmen ""Habenera,"" and the pathos of Sister Benedict's TB spot doesn't strike the heart the way old Fitzgibbon's reunion with his doddering mother does.I really wanted to like the movie, too.

1293198,"In movies recently, American audiences are fed alot of crap, frankly. We get the inevitable Saw VI, Alvin And the Chipmunks: The Squeakuel, and other tripe that American filmgoers seem to flock to. Rarely are we shown a movie that shows people for what they really are, and life, for what it really is, and even less frequently do audiences actually acknowledge it. And, for this holiday season, which is more or less a dumping ground for Oscar nominees and hopefuls, we are shown a bright, intelligent, fresh, witty, hilarious, yet depressing picture from some of the best in the business. That picture, my friends, is Up in the Air.Up in the Air features George Clooney as a man named Ryan Bingham, a ""corporate downsizer"", who goes from town to boring town, to fire employees, for businesses who don't have the guts to do it themselves. He's never had a real human connection in his life until he meets another frequent flyer named Alex, lovably played by Vera Farmiga, who showed real, gutsy, raw talent in the criminally overlooked horror flick Orphan, earlier this year. Alex shares alot of emotional stamina with Ryan, they click almost instantly. The chemistry that these two actors share is worth the price of admission alone.Later on, we meet an ambitious young worker named Natalie (a beautiful star turn by Anna Kendrick, who had a brief part in the Twilight movies), who has an idea to cut costs by conducting employee layoffs from the internet.After so many films a director makes, something of a trademark begins to appear, and Jason Reitman has his trademark down. And it's not a bad trademark like other directors certainly have. He has a knack for making emotionally relevant, and hilarious, yet deeply poignant and insightful films that are extremely watchable, and separate themselves from the usual Hollywood dreck that we're so used to.His last film, 2007's Oscar hopeful Juno did kind of the same thing. It gave us that salty-sweet combination, and a lot of memorable dialogue. I could only imagine what this picture would be had Juno's Diablo Cody written it. But Reitman, writing alongside Sheldon Turner, whose previous credits include 2005's remake The Longest Yard, which I didn't particularly care for. As I've said, the writing here is witty, hilarious, and completely realistic.Up in the Air is a very timely picture as well. Its major themes are corporate downsizing, and budget cuts. There's a scene in the movie where Natalie's boyfriend breaks up with her over a text message, and that's something that I know well, and I'm sure everybody else does as well. It brings up issues about how impossible love is if you're a member of today's generation, and that's part of what makes this movie so exciting.Up in the Air is a difficult movie to describe. It's not quite a comedy, not quite a drama, and there's romance, but it's by no means a romantic comedy, or a romantic ""dramedy"". There's triumph and tragedy, laughs, and tears. But what's so amazing to me about it, is how closely it relates to real life. It's real, and rewarding, and a movie I'd certainly recommend.",N/A
1382599,"What a lovely, wonderful story this was. Sure it's way too brief at just 68 minutes, but the cinematography, the expert camera work along the way, and the story line itself is just so great to behold and settle into a cozy chair to watch unfold.We begin the story watching flashbacks to three soldiers in the war, showing them to be who they are today. David Jason, as we progress, shows none of his Frost or Del Boy quirks here, which is good, and we soon forget about those characters and believe in this older one. David Warner hasn't been around on US screens for a while, and as this film was made for ITV Television in Britain in 2009 - and is seeing its first release in the US on this DVD - it seems most likely his US cinematic days are done.Shame though as he puts in a stellar role alongside that of Jason. When the two men are 'liberating' the corpse of their friend, Michael Jayston, Jason whispers, ""He's in here."" To which Warner replies, ""Why are you whispering? He's dead, not resting!""Once in Germany they, for no apparent reason save for she might be able to help them read the maps, pick up a young, blonde German hitch-hiker called Vicki, who they continue on their adventure with. 'Albert's Memorial' may be about a task that 70-year olds should never have undertaken, but felt they should do is definitely a ""black comedy"" for sure, but comes complete with some serious, thought-provoking moments too.Revolving around the ""last wish"" of one of a trio of World War II soldiers to be buried in Germany on the hill where the three were stationed in Hindenburg, the reasoning of such a request is revealed in more ongoing flashbacks. Concentrating on the two experienced British actors playing senior citizens coping in a younger world, their young female companion aiding in the driving and the listening along the way, their collective trials and tribulations in getting the embalmed corpse of their friend to his final resting place is truly brilliant to watch unfold.How they finally come across the EXACT spot where it all happened, and the actual spiritual finale of an ending is NOTHING you can see coming - I promise you!

His energy and enthusiasm and passion for music is infectious and the orchestra loves him as much as the audience.  This recording of the Gala Opening Night for the 2010-2011 season is more like a Prom concert or a New Year's spectacular.  The music is light but very well performed, the guest soloist is the handsome current rage of the bel canto opera stage Juan Diego Fl&oacute;rez, and the emphasis of the evening is fun.  There is less concern for craftsmanship and repertoire than there is for simply having a good time - balloons, confetti and all.The first half of the concert is devoted to Rossini with Dudamel spinning and dancing the overtures to 'La Gaza Ladra' and Semiramide' and Fl&oacute;rez having a jolly time with arias form 'La Centerentola' and 'Semiramide'.  After intermission the stage became Latin in honor of both Dudamel's (Venezuela) and Fl&oacute;rez's (Peru) roots, and in appreciation that there is a very large Hispanic population in Los Angeles the orchestra hopes to capture.  The orchestra bounced through Jos&eacute; Pablo Moncayo's ""Huapango"" and Arturo M&aacute;rquez's Danzon No. 2 and Fl&oacute;rez offered some all but forgettable 'canciones' and ended the concert with a couple more of bel canto arias.  Dudamel and Fl&oacute;rez appear to be having a great time on this DVD, but the sound is only mediocre and the camera work is distracting.  Of note, the other evenings of this opening of the new season were not repeats of the fiesta, but rather got down to some serious music - Beethoven and Schumann.

Oh the film rocks alright, but primarily because of the sequences that take place on the alien world the human characters are attempting to free of its natural resources. These sequences are brilliantly colorful, and completely appropriated from Roger Dean's ""Dragon Dreams"", and lets not forget the blue aliens in the Star War's saga by George Lucas. In that sense the film is the most transparent attempt to rip off other creative people I have ever seen.

I just sat down to watch it again and was very disappointed to see that the film had been cut, with several scenes deleted.  In particular, they must have decided they wanted to practically cut Donal Donnelly's Freddie Malins character out of the movie, as they cut two scenes early in the movie that provided great (drunken) comic relief- his entrance and bathroom scene (""anything under a mile and he'd miss the finish"") the racing discussion and story Freddie tells of 'old man gallaher' and the girl practicing with a piglet story.As the film is a slice of life story centered on a dinner party in 1904 Dublin, it is a pity these scenes and other bits were cut.  I don't see any reason for the cuts- it's not like this was a long film to begin with, or that they needed to cut it to fit it on a single DVD.A great film has been cheapened by Lionsgate.

Perhaps the worst thing is the film is the nearly unreadable font of the opening credits, but after that, it's all excelsior. It's small moments remind me of The Jimmy Show, a terrific, and similarly unsentimental, 2001 film that got as much indifference as this film got hype. Both films are unafraid to show life's unpretty side, but neither film buys into the false heroics of Hollywood endings, nor the false travails of more melodramatic `indy' films. It also piques one to envision what a truly adult film by the hit and miss director Kevin Smith would be like, since his films are all set in New Jersey, with blue collar folk, as well.Randy `The Ram' Ramzinsky is what his daughter claims, a screw-up. But, he realizes it. So many of the characters in films, and people in real life, delude themselves into thinking they are things they are not. And it is this sort of strength that makes the film an `adult' film, not Tomei's nudity (watch the scene where Randy heads down from the supermarket bathroom to enter the deli box, pauses, with the blare of a pro wrestling entrance theme playing, breathes, then enters to the silence of mundane work). More of this is needed. Perhaps Darren Aronofsky, if he's learnt the lessons of this film, can pick up the gauntlet that John Cassavetes tossed down a few decades ago, but which remains on American cinema's floor. If not, at least here's hoping he does not return to his earlier ways. If, instead of navel gazing masturbatory philosophy, a dose of blue collar realism (and no sport is more blue collar than pro wrestling) can work wonders for an artist like Aronofsky, imagine what it can do for the blue collars that watch it.

Well, we learn that it doesn't matter, in this case it's not important, it isn't about sex. Johnny is starved for true affection, wanting to matter, to be substantial in someone's heart, to be loved as a person, having come from a wealthy, but indifferent, family whom he rarely interacts with. Alexa and Ben, his new friends, are caught up in their own pursuits. Ben has a crush on Johnny to the point that it forces Ben out of the closet. Alexa is ambitious, but she's confused as to why she really finds Johnny attractive. She wants to be an actor and is drawn to those who have a natural gift for it. This film defies the labels we apply to ourselves and others in order for us to follow some safe stereotypical path, to create a sense of security for ourselves. We want to follow the road most travelled so that we can believe we are ""normal"". The problem arises in the trio's relationship when Johnny mistakes the interest that his friends show toward him for honest affection. And, as many young people do, Alexa and Ben are oblivious to what Johnny really needs, being consumed by their own goals. Sex really doesn't matter to Johnny and so it is left as a side issue and we never know what his true sexual inclination is. One of the most revealing and heartwarming moments in the film is when Ruth (Ana Gasteyer) is taken aback by Johnny's forwardness when he reacts to her genuine compassion with sincere affection and love. A great film that reveals the confusion of youthful pursuits stem from the innermost needs that we really have.",N/A

You really have to have a creative, and spontaneous thought pattern, and also be creative when viewing a film like this. Its definitely a unique film that won't appeal to all audiences. Not to spoil the movie for people who haven't seen it, but the young girl Salmon(Suzie) is murdered by a local man in her neighborhood, and while being in between worlds, of heaven and earth, she tries to point the way to help her mourning family find her killer. So actually what i'll do is break it down in pros and cons to tell the good and bad points of the film.Pros1. Stellar effects as expected from Jackson for the in between world seens, just beautiful2. The storyline has been done before, mainly in a movie like Ghost but is a lot more in depth this time around.3. Good performances from Mark Walburg, Steven Tucci(up for an oscar), and an ok performance from Saoirse Ronan(suzie).4. The reactions of the family were very plausible, though a little underwhelming in some spots.5. Great music throughout, and great cinematography.6. Just a good overall feel that the movie was very well planned and thought out.7. Interesting but strange on where the title The Lovely Bones came from, a bit disturbing actually.Cons1. Some pretty disturbing moments and visual content, possibly an R rating? Especially when involving young girls.2. Susan Sarandon while good is totally misplaced in this film as the grandmother.3. That being said Susans Sarandons character seems very unmoved, numb, and even seems happy that Suzie is gone, she comes to take care of the other children and makes it the comic relief of the film.4. Not the ending you want in anyway, but effective, the killer doesnt seem to get what he deserves.5. The wife of the film is pretty lousy, and leaves the family to be on her own, why? To mourn? It doesnt really specify and she is never seen again after about half way through the film.6. Some of the dialogue in a bit off base with not knowing whether to be serious or funny, or how to take it.7. Mark Walberg is a total wimp in the film, but a good father.8. It is never really explained why the killer did what he did, to Suzie, or the other people you find out he has killed, a major stone left unturned. Pervert, serial killer, child molester? You never find out.So all in all i liked the film because of its unique and intriguing ghost type premise and the visual effects, Peter Jackson is still right up there with Lucas and Spielburg, but he needs to make his next 2 Hobbit films great so we can see his real talent at work. The Lovely Bones is a good film (to me) but not stellar, i give it four stars because even with all the cons it still had a pretty positive impact on me, its just better if you share the movie with someone else, but a bit boring by yourself. Btw your young kids really shouldnt see it, the moments that are a bit improper really would make children feel violated, and as i said i think they should have beefed it up to an R rating because of that fact.",The Lovely Bones
1073227,"The story, Mimzy Were the Borogroves, finished with the girl traveling into the future to save the world from extinction. What was wrong with that? It would have been great to be included in the film. While I don't have kids of my own to be my test viewers, I can only think on face value.  Producer Michael Phillips (E.T.) also worked on the popular nostalgic films of The Sting and Cannery Row with David S. Ward.  His tendency to over-produce and add too many new ingredients repeats in Mimzy. Robert Shaye was an unusual choice for a director with only one previous film among his credits. So, two producers are deciding where the final film will go.  The special effects were overdone and the music often repetitive, but the children's parts were well cast even though a bit too young for so many stressful and demanding situations. Alien fiction can also do without the cliches of bright lights and superior races that always let themselves be discovered by the F.B.I.(Why were they so superior if they let their presence leak out by causing a power failure?) There are plenty of trivia, video games and puzzles on the extra menu that kids might enjoy. I think what's missing from the film is a suggestion of what WE CAN DO to protect our environment and save humanity from extinction.",N/A

1361803,"I am a bit stunned by the high marks for this film. While it is a bit irreverant and silly, it lacks any cohesion, suspense, or scares. However, if you are a fan of Herschell Gordon Lewis you might find something worthy of your interest.The story centers around a group of eccentric friends, armed with weapons they can hardly use, going to the backwoods for an hunting expedition. Our main character has some loosely described history about an uncle and hillbilly friends,not to mention a giant pig, but this is not explored at all. In fact, his former backwoods buddies rather unexepectedly just show up with no explanation. As do a ""hippie"" cult that has some unexplained connection to the large pig that makes a cameo near the end of the flick (or at least his head does). There are numerous storylines that are simply left dangling, and watching the movie can be an exercise in frustration. There is simply no reason for any of this to be happening.

1292999,"An extraordinarily talented and experienced international law enforcement officer watched this on loan from me before I saw it, and hated it.  Now that I have watched it myself, I understand--if you have not been deeply engaged with CIA and all of its idiocyncrasies including remote viewing, acoustic-kitty, the pigeons that came before Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAV), and then over to SOF (Special Operations Forces) where ""unconventional"" had to go covert to survive the straight-leg generals with no clue, you will simply not appreciate this movie.DanD nails it--this is satire and also a brilliant documentary of what can only be decribed as a well-intentioned long-running Goat F..k.  The movie is a collage of several different real initiatives including the First Earth Battalion (I knew a couple of the principals, decades ahead of their time); the Peace Warrior initiative, and of course Remote Viewing, the CIA's notorious MKULTRA and LSD for unwitting victims, and so on.At one point in the movie the two principal actors are discussing the remorse--the angst--over having used his power to actually kill a goat with his mind, and the other guy pops in with ""Silence of the Goats.""  That just about sums it up--this is, for someone steeped in the well-intentioned lunacy of the past--a perfect five, and I have to believe that the world-class actors that decided to do this did it knowing that it would be misunderstood by many, but a real hoot among the veterans of the seventies and eighties.The only thing not in here, certainly worthy of a sequel to this movie, is extra-terrestial encounters, leveraging extra-terrestial technologies, warnings from extraterrestials [humans now being in a state of quarentine for being stupid squared], and the exotic, wasteful, and generally hilarious methods used to keep Area 51 and related projects ""secret.""See also:Peaceful Warrior (Widescreen)First Earth Battalion Operations Manual: Reprint of Original Manual from the 70'sOn the Psychology of Military IncompetencePsychic WarriorPsychic Warrior: The True Story of America's Foremost Psychic Spy and the Cover-Up of the CIA's Top-Secret Stargate ProgramMemoirs of a Psychic Spy: The Remarkable Life of U.S. Government Remote Viewer 001Hidden Secrets: The Complete History of Espionage and the Technology Used to Support ItHidden Truth: Forbidden KnowledgeDisclosure : Military and Government Witnesses Reveal the Greatest Secrets in Modern HistoryHidden Truth: Forbidden Knowledge",N/A

The main story is a young man who dies and is looking for his lost love as he befirends a few others along the way.The prosI LIKED THE idea of people dying and going to a worse or better version of their current lives rather than heaven or hell. The acting was pretty good in my opinion with his Russian friend being the funniest character in the film. A good love story to watch with your girl friend. I also kind of like films that don't have a ton of things blowing up or fight scenes some times. I like the facts that you have a bunch of friends on a long road trip bonding as they reach their goal. The film also has directors commentary and deleted scenes for people who like those tpe of things.The consI really wish they had went into some more details about the PIC people in charge and what they did exactley and why. I would have liked them to explore the causes of and issues of suicide a bit more. I also would have liked to know more of how things work in this after life as compared to the real world. There is a brief scene of one character slitting his wrist and another threatning to commit suicide by hanging  that might turn some viewers off.

1160742,"Forget about Carmen Sandiego.  What we really want to know is where in the world is Osama bin Laden?  That's what Morgan Spurlock, the documentarian who brought us ""Super Size Me,"" is determined to find out - and he's gone and made a whole movie on the subject.  He wonders why, all these years after 9/11, the man who perpetrated that atrocity has yet to be found and brought to justice - even with a $25 million reward hanging over his head.  So if the CIA and the FBI can't locate him, perhaps Spurlock himself can.  And with a baby of his own on the way, Spurlock has a new-found reason for wanting the world to be a peaceful place.  So off he goes on a tongue-in-cheek - but, at the same time, deadly serious - tour through some of the most dangerous places on Earth in search of the Most Wanted Man in the universe.So, after getting his inoculations, a little defense and survival training, some language lessons and tips on fashion, Spurlock is off and running on his journey.He makes stops in Egypt, Morocco, Israel, Jordan, Saudi Arabia, Afghanistan and, finally, Pakistan (where most experts believe bin Laden is hiding out, if,  indeed, he's alive at all) and, in each of those places, he discovers that people are just people, regardless of their religious and sectarian differences, and that the vast majority of them want pretty much the same thing: to earn a decent living, to provide for their families, and to see their children grow up in a world where people are free to live at peace with one another.Not that he doesn't encounter individuals who express support for bin Laden and al Queda and sympathize with their causes - just that such people appear to be in the minority, even in that part of the world.Spurlock is unsparing in his criticism of America for propping up dictators in these areas and for funding their brutal regimes, thereby providing a fertile breeding ground for present and future terrorists.  But he also takes swipes at the radical Muslims themselves, who, through their extremist, blood-soaked actions, do all they can to give Islam a bad name.  Perhaps, the most fascinating leg of the tour occurs in Saudi Arabia, where even Spurlock is shocked by what he sees:  a country where church and state are truly one, where there is no freedom of speech or the press, and where religious moderates are as rare as a bin Laden sighting in a local strip joint. This leads to the most bizarrely incongruous and darkly amusing image in the film:  that of an opulent, state-of-the-art mall swarming with women shoppers covered from head to toe in black burkas.While Spurlock is dead serious in his intentions, his tone in ""Where in the World is Osama bin Laden?"" is refreshingly light-hearted and gleefully ironic.  He even finds humor in exploring the caves of Tora Bora, where, it is believed, bin Laden planned out the 9/11 attacks and where he was last seen.  Spurlock also uses animation and simulated video game imagery to enliven the tone.It doesn't require a spoiler alert to report that Spurlock is ultimately unsuccessful in finding bin Laden - if that indeed was his actual goal.  But if his intention was a broader one - namely, providing an amazingly comprehensive survey of attitudes in the Muslim world and to show that we are all in this fight together - he has achieved it ten times over.",N/A

1129388,"A fascinating silent by Robert Wiene, who I guess will always be linked with CABINET OF DR CALIGARI, but in many ways this is a superior effort to his more famous endeavour. Let's be brutally honest: for all of CALIGARI'S virtuoso expressionist design flourishes, it lacked a lot when it came to plot and pacing. By the same token THE HANDS OF ORLAC is plot-lite and slow moving, but Conrad Veidt brings so many fascinating movements and facial mannerisms to the title role as he emotes his repulsion towards his new self. The brilliant sleepwalking sequence where Veidt moves with such graceful menace is alone worth the price of purchase! Interestingly, film theorist Thomas Elseasser in his book WEIMAR CINEMA AND AFTER (highly recommended for Weimar film buffs) suggested that THE HANDS OF ORLAC depicts castration panic (Yikes!) - which, considering this film was made in Vienna (psychoanalysis-central),  gives a highly intriguing angle!!! Although I found the ending of ORLAC disappointing and more than a little trite, this film deserves to be in the collection of any Weimar devotee.There is also an extremely interesting featurette on the DVD in which the restorer of ORLAC, Brett Wood, freely discusses the relative merits of the Murnau Stiftung 35mm print (MS) versus the Rohauer Collection 16mm (RC). It's informative and opened my eyes to a few things with silent movies, especially learning about how two cameras were used when filming. Wood makes for an excellent narrator.Wood explains that the restoration uses the MS print largely because it's a sharper print, whereas the RC print is high in contrast but poor in definition. However watching the scenes on the featurette made me realise that in some ways the RC camera angles, speed and editing is often superior to the MS, despite the clarity. On balance I think the MS was a good choice - except for one decision that Wood took and that is not including the double exposure effect during Regine's confession in the final restoration. Wood correctly describes this alternative take as illustrating an hypnotic influence over Regine and I think it was a real mistake not to use it. Considering that we had already had a similar visual effect earlier on ""haunting"" Orlac's thoughts, it would seem appropriate to give continuity of effect and expression throughout the entire film, rather than just at the start. In fact, the odd request for Regine to ""seduce"" Orlac's hands (Elseasser makes even more sense now!) seems thoroughly bizarre without including this effect - why would someone in their right mind obey such a peculiar instruction if they were not in fact hypnotised?! But, then again we are talking Weimar Germany...All debate aside, I thoroughly enjoyed ORLAC, and silent films fan will too!",The Hands of Orlac

338737,"Despite occasional slapstick and the kind of randy humor that's to be expected from a movie made in the '70's, this comedy-Western-drama (it changes focus as it nears its end) is one of my favorites (possibly because of a scruffy--if not nerf-herding--Harrison Ford, two years off his defining role as Han Solo inStar Wars Episode IV - A New Hope (1977 & 2004 Versions, 2-Disc Widescreen Edition)).  In the year 1850, a recently minted Polish rabbi, Avram Belinsky (Gene Wilder), dreams of going to America and encountering the Indians and Wild West types he's read about.  When his chief rabbi receives a request from a group of San Francisco Jews to send them a rabbi and a Torah, he gets his chance.  Of course, being a greenhorn, he's no sooner off the boat in Philadelphia than he falls afoul of the Diggs brothers (George Ralph DiCenzo, William Smith) and their accomplice Mr. Jones (Ramon Bieri), who rob him of his last penny and set him afoot in Lancaster County.  Eventually, thanks to a compassionate Amish community, he makes it as far as the Midwest, where he falls in with train-and-bank robber Tommy Lillard (Ford).  Tommy doesn't know a rabbi from a tomb-rubbing, but he certainly knows a tenderfoot when he sees one, and before long he's taken on the task of seeing Avram to the coast alive.  Bitter winter weather, Indians, and eventually confrontations with Jones and the Diggses test both men's resolve and serve as the glue that bonds them as best friends.  In the end Tommy must help Avram restore his lost belief in himself, and Avram must face Matt Diggs alone.The movie provides Ford with one of his most delightful roles (Tommy and Avram inspired a long cycle of fan fiction, most of it unfortunately OP), and despite his often very rough personality and language he makes a sympathetic character of the part.  (The novelization,Frisco Kid, will provide some background and help smooth out at least one rather glaring omission of exposition.)  Though the historical accuracy is sometimes questionable and the title slightly puzzling (at no time is either character called ""the Frisco Kid""), the central motifs of buddyship and determination make this a good movie for families with older kids.",N/A

579421,"Pearl Jam's Touring Band 2000 DVD takes footage from numerous shows on their 2000 tour and mixes them all into what feels like one single concert. The performances themselves are great and the audio is powerful and loud; it doesn't take much volume to be blasting the thing. The ""set list"" includes Long Road, Corduroy, Grievance, Animal, Gods' Dice, Evacuation, Given to Fly, Dissident, Nothing as it Seems, Even Flow, Lukin, Not for You, Daughter/It's Ok, Untitled, MFC, Thin Air, Leatherman, Better Man, Nothingman, Insignificance, I Got ID, rearviewmirror, Wishlist, Jeremy, Do the Evolution, Go, Parting Ways, and the encore Rockin' in the Free World. As stated, the musical performances are top notch and the band sounds energetic and great. On the DVD they pretty much just stick to playing the songs, with occasional forays or commentary from Eddie. Two notable moments are 1) in Given to Fly when a woman is on stage doing sign language interpretation before Eddie comes over and begins dancing with her at the end of the song; and 2) during Rockin' in the Free World when Eddie pulls some kid named Jesse from the audience and takes him on stage, initially letting him just stand there and dance before putting him on his shoulders and taking him around the stage, culminating with the kid receiving a drum stick and helping to end the song with cymbal crashes. The one thing that really bothers me about the main concert though is the visual quality, which is awful. It looks like it was transferred from a worn-out VHS, with very grainy visuals, ""halos"" around the band members, and even wavy worn-out-VHS-type lines if you look carefully at stationary items like the amps. It is not distracting enough that it's unwatchable by any means, but it's worth pointing out that it is far from pristine since it's a DVD and obviously the visual appeal is part of the reason for watching it. Otherwise, though, the concert material is fine and they did a great job of putting together great performances from the tour that span the band's career at the time, with the exception of No Code which is hardly represented at all.The extras are pretty good. They start with European tour montages starting with ""The Cities,"" which shows footage of the band and the crew in the various cities with a cool instrumental playing over it, then moving onto ""The Band,"" which shows footage of the band playing onstage again with a couple cool instrumentals, and then ""The Fans,"" which shows footage of fans at the shows while Yellow Ledbetter plays over the montage. Then there is ""Smile,"" a separate montage that compiles loads of humorous moments from the band during the tour, including many which involve the band in various costumes; it is aptly titled, as it is really funny to watch. Then there is the ""Matt Cam"" feature with a camera centered on Matt for Evacuation, Even Flow, and In My Tree. It is cool to watch him drum and especially in In My Tree you can see what a great drummer he is, but it's probably slightly more interesting for actual drummers. Finally there are two bonus music videos, Do the Evolution and Oceans. Both are great and are worth watching (and both are on YouTube...).Overall this is really a great DVD that is a must for Pearl Jam fans. The musical performances are great and the band consistently hits the mark throughout the set list with high charisma and strong musicianship. The extras are not essential, but are fun to watch, particularly the two music videos and the Smile montage, which is maybe the highlight of all the bonus features. I removed a star simply because the visuals are so downright bad; if I could remove a half-star that'd be more like it. Definitely worth watching or purchasing for fans.",Pearl Jam - Touring Band 2000

I prefer ol' McClane to slicker more ninja-like modern heroes, and you probably will too.  He's still reliable as an action lead.  Timothy Olyphant is a good villain and Justin Long is pretty funny and not as irritating as I feared.Because it falls short, I WOULD have given it two stars.

204480,"Universal/Amazon.com has just released a very good DVD-R transfer of this film in anamorphic widescreen.  This product is similar to the MOD burned discs of the Warner Archives program.  It is being sold through Amazon as an exclusive.  The image is crystal clear, and the sound is very good too.I don't need to belabor the film's merits, because many others have done so here.  Suffice it to say that the film is a stylishly entertaining mystery with a gimmick.According to character actor Jan Merlin, most of the celebrity guests only appear in the unmasking scenes at the end.  Robert Mitchum was the only guest star who actually acted in the body of the film while wearing the mystery makeup.  Many of the actors' voices were provided by voice artist extraordinaire Paul Frees.When the film was brand new in 1963, there was a blurb in the newspaper movie section that said ""Talk to Kirk Douglas!"", and a phone number was provided.  When you called the number, you simply heard a recorded message from Kirk in which he ballyhooed the opening of the film in that city.  That was another gimmick associated with this fun film.",N/A

The climax with the circus train crash is riveting, and though I'd say the character development is rather shallow, the characters do change and learn to work together, and the interplay between Charlton Heston and the other characters is really funny sometimes!  In addition, it is really funny to see Jimmy Stewart as a clown (named Buttons).  The only plot element left unresolved concerns some of the details about Buttons.

The creativity was miraculous, and over the years we have had the sequel to relish in, as it was a true sequel, not a dissapointment. And, perhaps, we would allow Pixar room to make one ""average"" movie, but no, they create the masterpiece simply called Toy Story 3. Nothing fancy, that's it, and I can't think of any better way. The business side is done, here's all the hard work in the movie.And Toy Story 3 has some enviable characters once again. Andy has not suddenly become the monster that he had feared, or the spoiled brat of a teenager that does not grasp the humanity within. No, Andy has grown up to become Jesus in my eyes. I'll try not to give spoilers, He must be somehow aware that Woody and the gang have feelings, or else he has such a heart, that even toys, without soul, without life, he humanizes and treats with dignity. Imagine the good deads this young man will do that are left to our imaginations. I think people register this well and the altruism is felt.I would not rate this movie higher than Toy Story as it is more sentimental for me. I grew up with that film and Toy Story 3 is new. This is a kids movie and kids do seem to love Toy Story 3. But saying that, Kids like me have grown up since the first and are coming to see this and are also enjoying it. Toy Story 3 doesn't seem to have better graphics than the second, and I'm sure that's the point. It retains the style that we identify with.This is a movie, that so many will enjoy with flawless happiness and without fault. Not everyone will approach it as the innocent movie for a younger audience, and might hold it in an inappropriate light. Some might spite all the reasons that have been unanimous, because of the seemingly unreproachable Pixar having so little resistance to criticism. No matter though, I am confident that all will find this movie to be enjoyable on some level.Pixar can't be touched, not even by a few reviwers on Rotten Tomatoes with seeming vendettas. Awards are something special for the fans and for the talented cast and crew and I'm sure Toy Story 3 will reap in its harvast of gold statuettes. But I can't help but think now, that there was much more they could have done. I thought if would have been artistically rewarding to push the limits a little harder. I know they are being true to the spirit of Toy Story-with its simpleness, but I put forth that maybe a little experimentation such as a dream scene of the toys in which the creators could have had freedom to make something artistic.Note: I saw this on premier weekend at the theater of my town.",Toy Story 3

There is graphic violence and a fairly gruesome scene where the main character cuts off his own tongue. That little detail doesn't give away anything in the main plot, but it should provide our gentle viewers with fair and sufficient warning. Take the R rating seriously. This movie is not for kids or teenagers. It's for mature adults who occasionally like to explore cinema's darker realm. The ending has a clever, but disturbing, twist. Some call it brilliant, perhaps with good reason. It's like a bloody version of an M. Night Shyamalan film. The purple surprise package ties up all the loose ends. You won't be perplexed.

1068768,"I remember this show's run like it was yesterday.  I was 12 and there was nothing else on tv to satisfy my scifi needs.  Star trek was in sporadic rerun, and that was great.  But there was nothing else.  This show rocked.  I loved the first season, and liked the second.  The changes they made in the second season brought the show more towards a fantasy show, and less like a strict star trek type scifi series.  Yes, i understand there are many who think this show never had a good rooting in genuine science, and that's fine.  You can say that about almost any scifi show.  It's a matter of degree.  but in the days it originally showed, I loved it.  It was fantastic.  Recent viewings of this show makes it apparent that it really  wasn't that great.  The stories are hard to swallow and the special effects weren't special at all....almost as bad as Dr. WHO.  While the original star trek holds up, this doesn't.  I think the main problem is the subsequent release of STAR WARS.  That so surpassed this in quality that this show became dated very quickly.  So while i may have loved this at 12, i was easily led to another galaxy at 14 and this became somewhat of a joke.  Watching now is really hard.  Finally, the producer's series prior to this one, UFO, is a different story.  The special effects are only part of the show, not the main part, and they hold up.  The stories are really really good, and while the show is somewhat dated, it finds a groove early on and is a quality glimpse at late 60's briton and british views on scifi and the future.  I like that show much more than space1999.  Thx",N/A

The older Eastwood gets, the more thoughtful.Hereafter is a movie, and psychics and the afterlife, which Clint at 80+ might be thinking about.The action, the main action in the movie starts with a Tsunami in south east Asia. A lead character, Marie Lelay, played by Cecile de France, hard-edged news reporter gets caught in the rising waters, drowns, and has a near-death experience. She experiences the afterlife before coming back to this one. This experience changes her life from a skeptic. The other hero, George Lonegan, played by Matt Damon, is a reluctant psychic. There is also a young boy searching for answers about death. I won't reveal more of the plot.This is a gentle and thoughtful movie, well acted and well directed, but it leaves a lot of questions unanswered. Like why the Damon is so reluctant to help people? Why he feels compelled to tell people all the negative things he ""sees""? I have met psychics who do this on a daily basis, who are much better, much more psychic, who tell their clients more than the Damon character. They are not bothered by having this gift at all.The main action here is the tsunami, in the first ten minutes. The rest is love story with a lot of synchronicities. These synchronicities tend to happen to and around psychics and not to most skeptics. The world (or our experience of it) expands or contracts depending upon our expectation of it (!) I had expected Eastwood would do more with his themes, but he didn't. he chose to stick close the the generally agreed reality. I would have liked to see more hereafter in Hereafter.Actually there is an amazing convergence of opinion from people who have experienced near-death and psychics about what to expect in the afterlife (though not from organized religions).

1352938,"In most sci-fi shows, time travel is usually just a one-off deal that never has any lasting repercussions. But it forms the centerpiece of ""Eureka Season 4.0,"" in which a single jaunt back in time causes sweeping changes for the citizens of Eureka -- it sounds like a cheap way of shaking things up, but the focus on what time travel has changed is pretty interesting.Carter (Colin Ferguson) is out jogging on Founder's Day when he suddenly goes back in time to the year 1947, along with Allison (Salli Richardson-Whitfield), Jo (Erica Cerra), Henry (Joe Morton) and Fargo (Neil Grayston). With the assistance of scientist Trevor Grant (James Callis), and are able to get back to present-day Eureka.But... some things have changed. Jo is the security chief of Global Dynamics and never dated Zane, Kevin is not autistic, Andy the robot is Carter's new deputy, Henry is married to a woman he doesn't know, and Fargo is now the director of Global Dynamics. Oh yes, and Grant has come forward in time with them.As they try to adjust to this new timeline, they have to deal with mysterious power surges, a zombie-style rage infection, a super-oxygen infestation, random teleportation (from 1947!), stalkerish A.I.s, people turning into stone statues, and hallucinations of people from the past. And Dr. Grant starts discovering that the future isn't all it's cracked up to be.I was starting to lose faith in ""Eureka"" after the disappointing Season 3.5, which was basically a bunch of standalone episodes. And while ""time travel ripples"" sounds like a cheap way of shaking things up, it actually works quite well here -- the writers spend the entire season exploring the repercussions of time travel.It sounds kind of grim, but there are some fun moments keeping it light -- particularly a cute Wall-E-esque robot, or Carter throwing the despised Fargo a ravening horde. The one real disappointment is the Eureka crossover -- it's not really BAD, but Claudia Donovan's visit is kinda anticlimactic because... she doesn't do anything except ogle the machinery and make out with Fargo.Colin Ferguson continues to be charmingly down-to-earth, even as Carter gets enmeshed in a very tense love triangle with Grant and Allison. Also fun: the writers take some clever pokes at Carter's role in the show (""Hello, I'm Sheriff Carter! I'm going to save the day with my everyman logic! Ha ha ha!"").But all the characters get some solid development -- Jo is in turmoil over the loss of Zane, Allison becomes even more of a fierce mama bear now that her son is normal, and Henry starts falling in love with the wife he doesn't even know (although this happens a bit too fast).

1305341,"Going into Inception was kind of a gamble for me as my friends and colleagues apparently know me better than I thought.  I've been hearing this is the ""one to check out"" since the day it arrived in theaters this past summer and while my friends have once again proven spot-on with their understanding of the kind of fiction I enjoy, it is always worrisome when so much hype comes my way.  I have to make a very conscious effort not to get swept up in it, as that is the sure-fire way to become disappointed with any project (however ambitious).That said I was able to suppress my tendency to become the ultimate Inception fan boy until its home-disc release then quickly snatched up the Blu-ray with reservations on picking up a Leo DeCaprio T-shirt and matching coffee mug.  To cut the chase, I enjoyed this film quite a bit but perhaps not quite to the levels my buddies assumed I would and the reason for this stems from the fact that some of its finest conceptual moments have been done before in various mediums.  However, we'll get to all that.  For now, let us get to the nuts and bolts of the picture.Inception tells the tale of Dom Cobb (Leonardo DeCaprio), an Extractor (a man who enters people's dreams to gather information).  With a team of dream-experts consisting of Arthur (Joseph Gordon-Levitt), Ariadne (Ellen Page), Eames (Tom Hardy), and Yusuf (Dileep Rao), Cobb is hired by Saito (Ken Watanabe) to implant an idea (a unproven process called Inception) into the brain of Robert Fischer Jr. (Cillian Murphy).If this sounds a bit muddled to you, then perhaps steering very clear of this picture will be your best bet.  For all of its intricate explanations, Inception is a venerable swirl of intense sequences that demands multiple viewings if any coherency is to be established.I liken the initial viewing experience to the first time I went though the original Matrix (another Warner Brothers piece with similar themes): The line between reality and the construct is quite hazy and the laws separating them aren't quite clearly understood despite plenty of exposition attempting to force-feed them to you.I suppose in the interest of the average viewer's sanity, Christopher Nolan was forced to integrate a technique that I personally am not too fond of here in that when the situation demands it, suddenly the rules established earlier on are said not to apply ""in this situation"", hence upping the level of danger to the characters involved.  Again though, given the complexity of the material here, it is far more forgivable than if used in a more-linear piece.And speaking of linearity, I will continue to summarize the plot without giving away any real spoilers.  Cobb could well be the ultimate mind thief except for one minor annoyance: The appearance of Mal (Marion Cotillard) who tends to turn up in Cobb's dreams and jobs, botching them out of spite.  Additionally we learn that Cobb is a proud daddy in the real world and that motivation to be reunited with his kids is the catalyst for his agreeing to such a risky assignment.In fact, so delicate is the act of incepting a persuasive motivation that it demands Cobb and company to enter into a dream within a dream within a dream! Each depth of the subconscious mind said to be far riskier, more unstable, and (what I found to be coolest of all) operating in its own relative speed.The film is pretty stunning, visually, right from the onset with undeniable attention paid in the merging of gritty, moody dialog sequences with larger-than-life mind-bending effects.  Direction is spectacular here as well with camera moves and angles that dazzle continually.  Hans Zimmer's score is spot-on as well.  Truly from a technical standpoint, the piece is a stunner.The 2.5-hour runtime happens quickly and efficiently thanks to roller coaster pacing and a bit of disconnected editing work.In all, if having gotten this far in my review and aren't sure exactly how I feel about the piece, that's a pretty accurate observation.  Parts of this one are brilliant but unlike 1998's The Matrix or the 2005 novel Human Interface (both of which present some very similar mind-bending concepts), portions of Inception (especially the twist at the end) leave a flavor of forced existentialism.  There is potential for greatness here in every single moment of the picture but appreciation for it all takes time to settle in much in the same way one doesn't guzzle a bottle of fine wine.I suppose in conclusion the goal of science fiction cinema is to entertain and there is little doubt that Inception delivers in this regard.  It is certainly thought provoking, unique and technically impeccable.  I will conclude this review with a quote from the film that best describes the experience as a whole:  ""Dreams feel real while we're in them. It's only when we wake up that we realize how things are actually strange.""",N/A

He is joined by a team of fellow students comprised of a driven Kevin Bacon (TRAPPED, DEATH SENTENCE), a compassionate Julia Roberts (SLEEPING WITH THE ENEMY), a perverse William Baldwin, and a whiney Oliver Platt (LAKE PLACID, BULWORTH).

Curious George is one of the few shows we're very happy to let her watch and, together with Clifford, have become my daughter's favorite shows.

Although watching the episode didn't frighten my daughter, it did heighten her awareness about the dark and probably accelerated her discomfort with it.

1300456,"There are many problems with this movie, one of them not being that its a remake.  If this weren't a remake of an even more popular film then it would be just another been there, done that fiasco.  The original film gave Johnny Depp his start.  There doesn't seem to be anyone in this film that is on their way to the kind of career that he's had, but then again let's give it time.  His career took off immediately and this film is already a few years old.  The actors in this are your typical pretty boy and pretty girl where your job is to just look pretty on screen and we don't care if you can act.  Unfortunately, audiences are much smarter than filmmakers believe and want a character to be convincing.  The actor, Kyle Gallner, seems to be the only actor in this that demonstrates a bit of depth with weak material to begin with.  Jackie Earle Haley spends the entire film with his face hidden under a burned mask as the new Freddie Krueger.  He brings ominous tones to the character with stale one liners from this stale script.  People will be soon wishing the old Freddie with his hideous face and comic timing were back that Robert Englund brought to fame almost effortlessly.  The other problem this movie does is it reveals a more horrific past involving Freddie Krueger and the teens he's gutting one by one.  The more the film starts to reveal Freddie's history the less scary the movie starts becoming.  The movie is okay and that's merely because it's another one on the bedpost ad to the series.

Lu Feng is hunting the hero, Pai Piao, goes to Chen Shan's school seeking assistance, and discovers Sun Chien is purchasing medicine for someone other than himself.  This is when the real fighting is about to begin.  Lo Meng and Kuo Chui do an excellent job as two friends fed up with their meaningless daily grind.  An excellent scene is where Lo Meng (who can't read) asks Kuo Chui to read this parchment found on Pai Piao.  Lo all embarrassed with asking Kuo to read to him, but finds Kuo can't read either, this is really good acting.  There is a great deal of high quality sparring through the first half of this film, then upon Sun Chien being discovered the real fighting is about to take off.  The film could be better, but the intention of the storyline, is very well conveyed.  Chen Shan's unawaredness of his student mistreating Sun Chien is a mistake in the storyline and understandably unbelievable, yet this dosen't take up much of the story, and you do feel a bit resentful of the injustice.  This film has a very well done english dub translation and the voices fit the faces decently.  The sparring between Lo meng, Sun Chien, and Kuo Chui (who does a flip off these chairs piled up to about 15 ft. effortlessy.  A very well shot scene right there.  A definite must have for any Venom's fan and collector of real martial arts portrayed on film.  The Venom's are the real deal doing all of their own stunts and were taught weapons in chinese opera schools.  It is a bit fantastical, but that's part of the allure to Shaw Brothers entertainment.  I hope funimation does a great job remastering the english dub, and hopefully it will be released on time, for sure.",Avenging Warriors of Shaolin

744108,"After Star Trek TOS and the later seasons of Voyager I've always enjoyed DS9 over the other series (TNG and Enterprise) and despite the unavoidable comparisons with that other great sci fi series Babylon 5 I've always thought that DS9 was different enough from JMS' excellent storyline to avoid being an outright plagiarism.One thing that DS9 had going for it that Babylon 5 didn't was production money and so unlike the Babylon 5 dvd series, this DS9 dvd series has better special effects, a better soundtrack and overall better picture quality as well. In contrast with the Babylon 5 series where I feel it could definitely benefit from a thorough picture restoration when they finally put it on blu-ray I found this DS9 season 3 dvd set upscales very well to 1080p when I played it on my upscalable blu-ray player. The picture quality is not blu-ray reference quality but is a vast improvement over the first two seasons and although there are some soft and grainy picture frames (""Meridian"" was pretty bad) they were few and far between. The same holds true for the sound quality which is also pretty good unlike the Babylon 5 dvd series which I also hope will undergo intense restoration for the blu-ray release. For this reason, I am happy to stay with these standard dvds of DS9 that I already have rather than to ""upgrade"" to the blu-ray versions should they become available.Season 3 shows a vast improvement in terms of scriptwriting and storytelling and actually stands out among the better of the seven seasons and in my opinion is the most consistently good of the seven.  We see the introduction of the USS Defiant as well as the elaboration of the Dominion storyline, some of the funniest Ferengi episodes and unlike the other seasons when you get pretty poor episodes alongside some good ones, I could hardly find a dud episode here and indeed some of the best ever episodes in the entire Trekdom are found here.  I particularly enjoyed ""Second Skin"", the Riker cameo ""Defiant"", my favourites ""Past Tense Part 1 & 2"", ""Heart of Stone"", ""Visionary"", ""The Die is Cast"", and ""The Adversary"".  There are great episodes in seasons to come but they won't consistently sustain the high quality of episodes that we get throughout the entire season as we do here.The plastic packaging is also very attractive and robust unlike the Babylon 5 one which I actually had to superglue back together again when the disc holder came apart from the cardboard spine. Overall, this dvd set of season 3 of DS9 sports a good, clean picture and sound transfer which upscales well on blu-ray players.Recommended!",N/A

723922,"I consider myself quite well connected with the late 1960s, even being quite a Joan Baez fan in kindergarten! In the mid-seventies a relative gave me a big stack of old Evergreen Review magazines, and I started an interest in more counter-culture things from the '60s because of that, since I was just a child when much of it took place. One of the films Evergreen released in 1970 that they gave a lot of coverage to was Quiet Days In Clichy, showing tantalizing pics of the cast in naked moments. And in 2004 I finally got to see what the hubbub was about...Mainly a curiosity of the late '60s and of interest mainly for those interested in the ""art"" cinema of that time, this film is really another of those where philosophy and intellectual conversations are padded with people having sex, showing even the intellectuals have a base interest just like everyone else. But since it centers around someone like Henry Miller, it's high art apparently. Certainly off to an interesting start, the film immediately gets one to think though that there is a promise of more like the hardcore footage shown right after the strange credit sequence. That might have been better actually, because instead we then mainly get characters meandering around Paris and Luxembourg, laughing a lot and wondering why they are never satisfied.Here are some of the perplexing things for me:--Joey complains that Nys could have left him a few francs after he first met her and gave her his money, but Joey actually INSISTED she take all of it to begin with.--The guys keep yakking about how Colette's brains are in her genitals and that she just wants to have sex (a feeling they seem to have about women in general), but by watching this whole film it seems Joey and Carl spend all their time trying to get laid as well.--The women are portrayed as a bit mentally off, except for Colette's mother (upon which Carl then just says how hot she was, which seemed like belittling her after she was kind to them).--Joey is a writer, but we rarely see him even doing that, he just complains how he has no money and has nothing to eat, but can spend a lot of time walking around town and looking for sex.--Suddenly while in Luxembourg, and somehow with money, they wind up pouring bottles of wine all over prostitutes and letting the bread they have to just wind up in the tub and going down the drain with the wine. If we're supposed to appreciate Joey and Carl's ""bohemian lifestyle,"" it doesn't help that they just waste food and drink after always saying they never have it.--Hoping there would be a resolve to the story, instead, after a naked woman can't have sex with them because she was crying over the memory of her late husband, the others just sit there naked and laugh while the camera zooms in on their genitals. Huhhhh??? That's it?I don't regret seeing this film after wondering for so many years what it was all about, and discovering more curiosities from that era. It's just that I think some people will find any reason to say it's poetic mainly because Henry Miller is involved -- if this were not based on him and just a film of its own, I doubt as many folks would be worshiping it. Had a film been made of a character based on Henry Miller washing dishes for an hour and a half, I'm sure these people would somehow come up with many a thesis on the amazing meanings of it.But it all just comes down to silly naked people laughing, in my eyes...",Quiet Days in Clichy

1002222,"I found this 1966 BBC television production of ""The Three Musketeers"" quite satisfying, despite its limitations.  The casting is good, and the acting is intense and energetic -- if perhaps occasionally a bit too much so -- and it's a real pleasure seeing Brian Blessed and Jeremy Brett (many years before his marvelous Sherlock Holmes) at the beginning of their careers.  The costumes are excellent, thought it's a shame that the modest budget prevented this from being a color production, and the ten 22-minute films hew pretty closely to Alexandre Dumas' novel.  Again, the biggest pity is the small budget, necessitating far from razor-sharp black and white photography and apparently no music allocation whatsoever -- though effective use is made of Berlioz's ""Symphonie fantastique"" in each episode (but couldn't they fade to black for a couple seconds before slamming us into the end credits?).  Still, this is a much more successful rendering of Dumas' peerless novel than many other big budget productions.  I recommend it for fans of swashbucklers, Dumas, Jeremy Brett, and Brian Blessed.",The Three Musketeers

1284859,"I don't know why I was so skeptical of this movie, at first, because Warner Brothers has not disappointed me yet.  The voice acting was my main concern and afte watching the film, twice, I can say that the entire cast did very well.  Batman was my biggest worry and William Baldwin did a very good job.  Of course, he is hardly in the movie at all, until the end, and even when he is present he doesn't say very much.Although haven't read that many comics, I'm really interested in all comic book characters and I really enjoy being able to see new characters in animation.  While they don't really give you much backstory on the villains, it was interesting to watch the Crime Syndicate in action and their minions (evil counterparts of the expanded Justice League, i.e. Black Canary, Green Arrow, Hawkgirl, Vixen, and many others that I can't remember).  It's also fun to see Lex Luthor and the Joker (known as the Jokester on Qward) as good guys.The story was good, although as with most WB/DC films, a bit too short.  It felt a little rushed.  I also feel that they could have explained just a little more about the Crime Syndicate.  The fight scenes were exciting and fun to watch and there's even a bit of romance for one of the Justice League members, which I found unnecessary but I'm sure some people will enjoy it.I was again disappointed with the special features.  There is a featurette on the comic books with interviews of DC's writers and illustrators.  I'm sure that loyal comic book readers would find this very interesting but as a casual fan, I found it a bit boring.  There are previews for all the other DC movies (nothing new that I can remember).  The Silver Specter short was very good.  Done in 1970's style with a kind of gritty look, I thought the animation was amazing and Gary Cole was great as the main character.Overall, I enjoyed this release and look forward to the next one.

33069,"Dead and Loving It is a masterpiece, with pivotal acting that would have made any hollywood agent salivate. The scene in the anatomy college class is fantastic and hilarious, and well, let's just say the bedroom scene with the two draculaen brides attacking Renfield at the Transylvanian castle made a rise in my Levi's. Peter MacNicol in the role of Renfield is an absolute riot when you realize he's played other roles such as in Numb3rs, 24, and Boston Legal. Steven Weber is perfect as the victorian prude English twit who accompanies the film as Harvey Korman's assistant at the asylum. Harvey Korman is over the top doing a wonderful job in his role, and of course Mel Brooks is outstanding - especially the competitive dialogue with Leslie Nielson trying to get in the last word. Leslie Nielson should have received multiple awards for his acting, and I can't imagine anybody else being able to be so ideal for that role. Amy Yasbeck and Lysette Anthony are exceptionally fitted in their roles as English upper crust elite women who have no idea they are so appetizingly stunning. The story unfolds with smooth delivery, hilarious beyond my expectations, giving me every wonderful emotion and enrapturing eyefuls of great scenery, great architecture, attention to detail in faithfulness to Dracula story telling, and yet I nearly ended up on the floor a dozen times laughing hysterically. This is a wonderful addition to anybody's comedy collection, and even fits as a keeper for Dracula fans.

565037,"Dralion has always been a tough one for me. As a big Cirque du Soleil fan, I love shows like Quidam, ""O,"" and Varekai, but, while I did enjoy Dralion, it's just not one of my favorites. Perhaps its the more traditional circus nature of the show, perhaps its the somewhat-overdone themes, the more mechanical movement of some of the performers, or the more Eastern-inspired elements. Something about all of this things, particularly the more ""circus"" aspect, tend to turn me off on Dralion a little bit. That said, the filming of this show was fairly well done, and the vibrant colors of Dralion really come alive.Dralion is based on the idea of colliding cultures: East meets West. Even the name ""Dralion"" and its namesake characters represent this fusion. ""Dra"" comes from the Eastern dragon and ""lion"" is the more Western lion. With this concept in mind, Dralion's universe represents different countries throughout the world. The music has a strong world flavor to it, with heavy drums, tribal and Middle Eastern influences. The Dralion universe is also divided into four different groups representing the four elements: earth, fire, air and water. Each group is led by a character meant to represent different areas of the world: air=Europe/Americas, earth=Africa, fire=Asia, Water= Middle East.Unlike other Cirque shows, Dralion includes more Asian acts than others, thus, a stronger Asian cast. Some of these acts include ""Umbrella Juggling,"" ""Teeterboard,"" and ""Skipping Ropes."" Dralion also includes the wonderfully artistic ""Aerial Pas de Deux,"" an aerial silks act mixed with ballet that tells a heartbreaking story of two air characters.The costumes in Dralion follow the element color palate very closely (fire=red, air=blue, earth=green, earth=orange), which leads to bright, exciting visuals that make the performers jump off the stage, same with the sleek, modern set and the lighting. Everything about Dralion is louder and brighter than most Cirque shows, giving it a different look.While I wouldn't say Dralion is my favorite show, it's still enjoyable, great for families and easily accessible.",N/A

But the interesting themes of emotional stability, family discord and corporate greed make this interesting to watch.

Kern gets the whole family involved and seems on his way to riches, when his idea is swiped by the management of Ford Motor Company. The film deals with his efforts to manufacture the wipers on his own and prove his authorship in court.Kinnear did a nice job of playing Kearns, and gave him a little of the obsessed and complex personality that the man must have had. The Ford baddies, led by Alan Alda, came off as basically evil. I saw this as a shortcoming, The film really didn't delve into the complexities of a large corporation trying to work with an outside contributor who perhaps has an overinflated vision of his invention's importance.

272095,"Paul Jarrico wrote this in 1941, ten years before he was blacklisted for ""taking the Fifith"" before HUAC, but that's the history hook for me. Jarrico said he had intended this as political satire, but in later life thought it was actually a romantic comedy. I found the story a piece of delightful froth and there was a message if you look for it.Janie (Ginger Rogers), a perky telephone exchange operator, has the choice of three men to marry;Tom (George Murphy) the upwardly mobile middle-class go-getter,Dick (Alan Marshall) the urbane rich man andHarry (Burgess Meredith) a poor but streetwise noncomformist.The film has fantasy comic dream sequences where Janie acts out married life with all three men. In the end Janie makes her choice and if you understand Jarrico's view of life you can guess which one she drives off with. The interplay between the three men for Janie's hand was bright and funny and Jarrico is consistent with his perspective in showing that poverty does not rob a man of wit or smarts.It was interesting for me to see Ginger Rogers with an energetic screen image indepenent from a Fred Astire dance partner.I was surprised to see Phil Sivers, the pushy ice cream seller at lovers' point,  showing much of his ensuing ""Sargeant Bilko"" sparkle - a TV show that Paul AND his wife Silvia wrote for as well.Take the film as 1941 style humor any enjoy it for what it is.",Tom Dick and Harry VHS

808871,"Dead End may seem a bit cliche to many horror fans, but the combination of pure suspense, great acting, and amazing plot separates this film from other horror films.  What starts off as any other Christmas family road trip, ends up as a night of pure terror.  The Harringtons seem like a typical family, a husband (Frank), wife (Laura), and their two children (Richard and Marion) on a typical family vacation.  The Harringtons spend every Christmas at their maternal grandmother's home and spend hours traveling to her home on an annual basis, but this year's journey is not the same as their past ones.  The trip starts off different in the first place, since Frank (the father, played by Ray Wise) decided to take a different route.  This route is supposed to greatly cut down on their travel time, but instead it ends up being a route that they should have never traveled.The problems begin when Frank falls asleep at the wheel, almost driving head on into another vehicle on the opposite lane of the highway.  Immediately afterward, Frank notices a woman dressed in white holding a baby on the side of the street.  The Harringtons offer the woman assistance by giving the woman a ride.  Unfortunately, there is not enough room in the vehicle for all of them, so the daughter (Marion) offers to walk.  The family stops at a station to call for assistance, but to no avail, seeing as the building is abandoned.  During this time, Brad (Marion's boyfriend) is left alone with the woman and her baby.  The events that follow are sure to shock the audience beyond belief.  One by one the family is being killed off, each time a black vehicle is seen carrying off the victim as they scream helplessly.  Their bodies later turn up mangled beyond recognition.The audience begins to witness how slowly each member of the family loses their sanity as the road they are traveling on appears to have no end in sight.  Driving for hours on end is getting the family nowhere, but each time they stop the car someone ends up dead.  It's a predicament that is deadly either way.  The suspense builds every time the vehicle stops, giving the audience the feeling of the upcoming events that are bound to unfold.  The film does a great job of implying who will be next on the list through the subtle hints provided with the characters' action and slow loss of sanity.  Each time it seems like the most vulnerable is the one to go.The pacing is incredible, never having the scares too far about, and never having them too close together either.  The story is given plenty of time to develop, giving insight on the family's personal matters such as affairs, and other family secrets that have long been hidden.  The ending is a true shocker, leaving the audience asking several questions.  Did these events even occur, or were they all imagined?  The last scene alone makes you question the events of the entire film, leaving you cringing in terror, sending goosebumps down your spine.  Truly remarkable.  A great film from start to finish that cannot be passed up, Dead End is a great little gem within the horror genre that is very reminiscent of Twilight Zone.",N/A

182523,"An interesting film, originally branded heretical by the Catholic Church.  Actually the first three-quarters of the movie is not particularly heretical despite the fact that it portrays a very human Jesus, a man initially confused by what seems to be happening and later reluctant to accept the fate that he knows is in store for him.Jesus [Dafoe's] relationship with Judas [Harvey Keitel] is probably the most interesting part of the story despite the fact that it is converse to most Christian theology.  Judas isn't a traitor but, instead, is Jesus most trusted apostle--an apostle entrusted with the nasty duty of 'betraying' his Master to his enemies.  Actually, I believe that this makes much better sense than the Judas as Betrayer versions.  If Jesus could predict his own death, then he could predict his betrayer.  He may very well have collaborated with him.  'Go quickly and do what you must do.'  Jesus orders Judas at the Last Supper--and--Judas does.  It has every appearance of an agreement between the two men.The last part of the movie, although completely nondoctrinal, has a lot to do with the excellent little book 'An Occurrence at Owl Creek.'  A Creole man is arrested as a spy and condemned to be hanged from the bridge at Owl Creek.  The rope breaks and our man hits the water and dives.  Yankee bullets whistle around him but he swims down the river and escapes into a thicket.  He painfully makes his way home to his plantation house only to be greeted by is sweetly smiling, beautiful wife.  The problem is, she has been dead for several years.  SNAP!  Our Creole man comes to he end of the rope and his neck snaps.'The Last Temptation' is very similar.  Jesus is 'tempted' down from the cross and is led to safety by his guardian angel.  Jesus leads a full life with wife and children only to learn, in his old age, that his 'guardian angel' is Satan he Trickster.  SNAP!  Jesus is back on the cross where he dies.Rather than sacriligeous, the tale--like 'An Occurrence at Owl Creek'--can be styled as an effort to depict the fact that, reportedly, things may slow way down at the moment of death and even be attended by realistic hallucinations.

Kad Merad is the post office manager who gets caught pretending to be disabled to secure a transfer to the South of France only to be given the worst punishment in the post office's power: a transfer to the cold north of France, the Toxteth or Detroit of France. Once there he quickly discovers that (unlike Toxteth) it's not the backward disease-ridden inbred peasant slum of popular ridicule, but finds that comforting his imagined suffering cheers up his depressed wife back home, so ends up persuading his new friends to live down to all the horror stories when she comes to visit...It's not the most original plot or treatment in the world, with much of the wordplay built around the local accent that adds chti to every other word straight out of Abbott and Costello's Who's On First routine, but while predictable it's still very funny more often than not. The early scenes are among the funniest, be it Michel Galabru's Dickensian (or should that be Hugoian?) horror stories of a childhood in the north to the sympathetic traffic cop who tears up a ticket when he finds out the condemned man's destination, and the end is rather abrupt, but it's a confident feelgood comedy that delivers the goods. Kudos to Michael Katims' excellent subtitle adaptation that manages to pull off the tricky alliteration, puns and wordplay that a lesser translator might decide were simply untranslatable.The French PAL 2-disc set offers a wealth of unsubtitled extras, from a few deleted scenes and outtakes to lengthy documentaries and a themed French episode of Who Wants to Be a Millionare, but the film itself boasts both optional English subtitles and a very good 2.35:1 widescreen transfer.",N/A

1315807,"""Capitalism:A Love Story"" is an interesting, thought-provoking documentary from Michael Moore. His breakout movie wasRoger & Me,which showed how Big Business was hurting workers and communities at GM in Flint, Michigan. ""Capitalism"" is about the current economic crisis, so it's more wide-reaching. Michael Moore is a convincing documentarian. Yes, his work is definitely biased, but he's persuasive.""Capitalism"" discusses how the banks have robbed the poor and enriched the rich. Of course, Moore lavishes praise on Cuba, Venezuela, and socialist countries. He seems to be blind to the real abuses in those countries. In Cuba, political dissidents are jailed. Here, Moore can freely criticize George W. Bush. Moore also brings in his Catholic background. He rightly bashes the prosperity gospel. He goes more for liberation theologyIntroducing Liberation Theology.""Capitalism"" has its pros and cons.Pros-The weaknesses in the current economic system-Convincing arguments-Great propagandaCons-It's propaganda, Moore goes for emotional arguments-Very biased-SocialistStill, ""Capitalism"" is a love story worth watching.",N/A

Harvey Girls worked in these restauarants, which were a chain which served train customers when the rails was the most important means or transportation in America.In this musical Judy Garland plays a reluctant Harvey Girl and the plot revolves around some elements in the town who are afraid that the restaurant will start civilizing the place: ""Next thing you know, they'll reopen the church!""

839063,"Well, if you like a flick that has lots of T and A with bawdy, and at times, sophmoric humor ala Benny Hill then this butt's for you. (And friends that poor pun is indeed an indication of the level of humor in this film.) However, I wasn't expecting anything more and so I was satisfied -- this being similar to some of  the Seduction Cinema fodder you might watch -- you don't watch it for cinematic excellence.Why Tony Curtis chose to play the lead in this is beyond me. Judging from the way he plays the character I assume he laughed all the way to the bank. He does seem to be having fun but then why wouldn't he, surrounded by more babes than you can shake a schtick at. The plot is a just an excuse for jokes and bare skin so if you expect to learn a single thing about the life of Casanova, forget it. Historical, it ain't.Still I gave it 4 stars because it was just what it proposed to be, a buxom, oversexed send up that was designed to appeal to prurient interests -- and it certainly appealed to mine. Then again, I like Benny Hill so what do I know. As the man once said ""I know what I like.""",The Amorous Mis-Adventures of Casanova
200761,"When two divers disappear off of the coast, the pictures from their underwater camera reveal police chief Martin Brody's greatest fear: another Great White shark has begun prowling the waters around Amity Island! JAWS 2 suffered countless problems in production, which caused for the removal of the original director (John D. Hancock) in place of longtime television director Jeannot Szwarc. The resulting film serves as a continuation of the events that occurred four years earlier, bringing back many familiar faces including Roy Scheider and Lorraine Gary as Martin and Ellen Brody, as well as Murray Hamilton and other returning members of Amity's city council. We are also introduced to the town's teens, whose day sailing adventures set the menu for the new shark. The once stern Chief Brody is reduced to a delusional mess when faced with another summer of blood, let alone the disbelieving council members that want to avoid another public humiliation. Unlike in the original, the shark emerges quite early on in this sequel, which relies on the viciousness of the attacks to earn its scares rather than the implied terror of the first. In doing so, the tension and suspense have both been dramatically reduced. John Williams plays a slight variation on his earlier themes, injecting them with a frenetic energy and creating a sense of immediacy in each strike. Outside of the slower pacing, the major flaw with this first sequel is that it attempts to mirror the structure of the original, but with less interesting characters found in the teenagers and a far less epic finale. Where Szwarc does succeed is in establish a sense of continuity in the similar look and feel of the film, while bringing back much of the same humor and heart in the script. As sequels go, it is a valid followup, but one that lacks bite.-Carl ManesI Like Horror Movies",N/A
1342575,"Bruce Willis has had the profound good luck to star in some of the greatest American action films of all time, including its single greatest: the first DIE HARD. And this paved the way for Willis to become one of the biggest film stars of the 1990's, and for better (PULP FICTION, THE SIXTH SENSE, the other two DIE HARD 90's films) or worse (THE COLOR OF NIGHT, STRIKING DISTANCE, MORTAL THOUGHTS, FOUR ROOMS), he was king. The two films in this Blu-ray double feature represent his best 90's action works: THE LAST BOY SCOUT and LAST MAN STANDING.THE LAST BOY SCOUT is another film in the mismatched buddy-cop actioner genre from writer Shane Black, who set the perfect blueprint for the genre with LETHAL WEAPON, slightly misstepped it with THE LONG KISS GOODNIGHT and injected fresh and wonderful life back into it with the woefully underseen KISS KISS, BANG BANG. But what's different about the mismatched pair here is one of them is a former Secret Service agent turned alcoholic loser deadbeat private eye (Willis) and the other is a former star quarterback turned gambling addict and coke-fiend (Damon Wayans)... neither of them are cops. But they're losers who are down on their luck that, despite themselves, find redemption as they take on corrupt government officials and sleazy, murderous sports executives. Both of the men that they seek to bring down are both involved in their respective falls from grace, so they look to dish out a heaping helping of cold-served revenge... until a wonderful plot twist has one of them protecting the very person who ruined his life.Tony Scott, prior to this film, had long been determined as an untalented, coat-tail riding hack whose flashy MTV-style of filmmaking used with such films as TOP GUN and BEVERLY HILLS COP 2 seemed to serve 30-second commercials better than a feature film. However, he proves that with the right script and the right players, from Noble Willingham and Taylor Negron to Chelsea Field and Bruce McGill and a before-she-was-famous Halle Berry, you can make a really great film. Ultimately it was the success of this filmYes, there are logic-holes that you could fly a 747 through (How does Willis afford such a beautiful home with his barely-solvent business?), and the film may not be up to par with the dramatic performances of a Merchant-Ivory film, but as pure adrenalinizing popcorn fare, it's perfect. Black's one-liners zing back and forth, Scott keeps a healthy tempo going, and it has the benefit of Willis playing one of the coolest action heroes ever. His character is probably a little too cool for a sense of realism, but that is NOT what this film is going for. It goes for mythical cool, by telling a tale of redemption of two fallen heroes in the snappiest and most entertaining way possible.Now, onto LAST MAN STANDING. This film is another remake of the legendary film YOJIMBO from legendary filmmaker Akira Kurosawa with legendary actor Toshiro Mifune as a ronin, or masterless Samurai, who reluctantly helps to bring order to a town with two warring gangs in feudal Japan. The first remake of the film was legendary directory Sergio Leone's A FISTFUL OF DOLLARS with legendary actor Clint Eastwood as a gunslinger-for-hire who reluctantly helps bring order to a town with two warring gangs in the Old West. Now, Walter Hill, director of such classics as 48 HRS. and THE WARRIORS brings Willis as a former mob gun-for-hire who reluctantly helps bring order to the dusty desert town of Jericho, that happens to have two warring mobs in the late 1920's. The film isn't jam-packed with action, but when you get the action, you really are slammed with it. The film also features Christopher Walken as the town's crazed main gun for hire (Walken playing a crazed and violent man? What are the odds?), WARRIORS and 48 HRS. alum David Patrick Kelly as the head of the town's Irish mob, Michael Imperioli as the idiotic cousin of the head of the town's Italian mob, Bruce Dern as the sleazy and amoral town sheriff and William Sanderson as the the heart-of-gold town barkeep. Willis gives a very understated, quiet cool performance that is pretty quip-free. But when he pulls out those twin .45's, you better run for cover. There is a spectacular shootout near the climax that is just awesome. And Ry Cooder's rock/blues infused score is a highlight as well.As a director, Hill had a series of missteps like BREWSTER'S MILLIONS, STREETS OF FIRE, RED HEAT and ANOTHER 48 HRS., but LAST MAN STANDING stands out as one of his strongest films, alongside his biggest successes and some of his other seriously underrated films, like WILD BILL and JOHNNY HANDSOME.Overall, this is a double-bill that features Willis in his prime as an action hero and major film star, and it doesn't hurt that both films are terrific.Warner Bros. Blu-Ray films can really vary in quality. Most of their Blu-Rays are very good, and some are very poor as far as additional content and the lack of lossless audio, which is part of the standard of Blu-Ray discs. Sadly, this is one of the examples of the latter. This disc does NOT have lossless audio. Watching THE LAST BOY SCOUT, every now and then, I can hear my player (and it's not an issue with the player or physical issues with the disc) rev up and there's a slight audio skip. It's doesn't terribly detract from the experience, but it doesn't help, despite the very crisp picture.Still terrific films, but it does have audio issues that might make more of a surround sound setup owner think twice before getting this.",N/A

I had the good fortune to spot her when my high school English class went to see the Royal Shakespeare on tour at the National Theater in Washington, DC, in 1964. She appeared there in Comedy of Errors. What a versatile actress! IMO she never got quite her due as a dramatic actress. Fans of Avenger will be shocked at the terrifying character she portrays in Mother Love. She revives memories of Gene Tierney in her Oscar-nominated performance in Leave Her to Heaven, a similarly absorbing tale of obsession truly run amok. Coincidentally Mother Love reminded me how much I missed David McCallum once Man from U.N.C.L.E. disappeared beneath the waves. He admirably portrays Rigg's ex-husband, an intellectual musician incapable of fathoming the depths of Rigg's depravity. Like the other reviewer, I have been waiting for this movie to be released for years. It was one of Mystery's finest presentations.",Mother Love
810513,"It's very easy to enjoy `Cold Mountain'.  In fact, I think that it would be hard NOT to enjoy it.  The film really contains nearly everything needed to make for an entertaining and thrilling and memorable ride.  The storyline in engaging (even if some have noted it runs a tad `false'), the acting is enthralling (even if certain performances don't hold up as well over time), the cinematography is spellbinding; everything from the feel to the look to the tone of this film is designed to satisfy your every cinematic want and need.So, it's safe to say that I thoroughly enjoy this film.Having read the novel (long after I saw the film), I must say that I was pleasantly surprised to see how well the novel was adapted.  Yes, there are changes (as will nearly every film adaptation) but with a novel that is so packed (stuffed you may say) with many characters and encounters and situations, it would have been easy for this film to lack fluidity.  It would have been easy for this film to feel claustrophobic and detached.  I was astonished to see that `Cold Mountain', the film, almost fares better than `Cold Mountain', the novel.  Anthony Minghella superbly crafted a film that carries a lot of weight yet never feels overly stuffed or too compact.  There is a breathy airiness to this film that helps create a fluid movement from scene to scene.  Despite the onslaught of characters and drastically separate situations (the story, in both written and cinematic form, is told in a very episodic manner) the film is very easy to follow.The story is a seemingly basic one; that of a soldier who goes awol in order to return to his love, a wealthy and sophisticated young woman.Some have balked at the unrealistic nature of Ada and Inman's love affair.  They barely knew one another and seemingly had nothing in common and yet we are expected to believe that they long for one another so drastically that they risk all (at least Inman does) in order to be with each other.  I think that this line of reasoning is rather simple.  This story is not really a love story in the typical sense.  I don't think that either Inman or Ada truly LOVE one another in the sense that they have formed everlasting and genuine emotional connections with each other, but I do believe that each party represents a better life and future for the other.  They are both longing to develop that connection, and to be freed from their apparent prisons (both very different yet both very much the same) and so they see in the other a chance to believe in something bigger than they are.  They are not risking all for each other, but in stark contrast, they are risking all for themselves.For me the film has rarely a flaw.  The script, while truthfully a hodgepodge of events, contains the atmosphere of pure storytelling and thus remains completely engaging and rewarding.  The performances for the most part all still hold up.  Jude Law is so moving and so heartbreaking as Inman.  He really understands how to convey his character's desperation without stripping him of a soul and making him a walking shell.  Small supporting roles from names like Donald Sutherland, Brendan Gleeson and Ray Winstone are all superb, and the string of cameo performances by big names like Philip Seymour Hoffman, Giovanni Ribisi and Jena Malone make their mark quite nicely.I still feel that Nicole Kidman was sorely miscast and that her empty and emotionless portrayal of Ada dampened the films overall emotional connection.  She seems to come to life when Renee Zellweger comes on screen, but it is her `coldness' (near stagnancy at times) that makes her longing for Inman hard to swallow.  Renee Zellweger is the focal point of ongoing debate over her zealous (overly so) portrayal of free-spirited Ruby.  I admit, she is entertaining, but over the years I too have found her performance near cringe-worthy.  It is not very good to be honest, and while it never fails to entertain, I fear that it is entertaining for the wrong reasons.Which is why I strongly feel that the supporting actress Oscar should have gone to her co-star Natalie Portman.  You know how they say that good things come in small packages.  In merely 5-10 minutes of screen time, Portman devours the entire film with her intense, believable, heartbreaking, strong and mature portrayal of a lonely and scared woman doing all she can to survive for the sake of her child.AMAZING.In the end `Cold Mountain' remains a very good film.  It suffers, for me, in the afterthought because it lacks a strong emotional surge.  It reminds me a lot of Minghella's other epic `The English Patient'.  It is beautifully staged, acted and scripted and yet, when the dust clears, it is strangely forgettable.It just doesn't `hit' you like you'd expect it to.",Cold Mountain VHS

Mena Suvari handled her part quite well, and Harry Dean Stanton comes across as the veteran pro that he is.  The direction, however, is a bit shaky.  The story mostly plays as a big screen production, but at times devolves into moments of forced drama, melodramatic like one would see on the big stage.

On the other hand, the movie is about the death of another.  Only in its last minutes does Ford tell us that this movie is actually about the viewer.

It is more like a piece of Christmas crud that might (hopefully, accidentally) get placed in your stocking.The magic icicle that stores Christmas Cheer throughout the year is melting fast. It seems that society as a whole has grown too cynical for Christmas. As a result, Santa Claus ( an especially pained and uncomfortable George Wendt) faces a major crisis/power failure at the North Pole. Also, Puppy Claus chooses to ignore his responsibility of  delivering gifts to dogs all over the world. He runs away and meets up with the ""Dog Buddies"" gang; who all must evade the clutches of dog catcher Christopher Lloyd.""Santa Buddies"" piles on every Christmas cliche in the book. Will Lloyd's cold and crusty dog catcher develop a heart of gold and give a free dog to a disabled boy? Will enough Christmas cheer be found in the hearts of cynical, jaded humans to save Christmas? Well, yes, but the production values on this ""Direct to DVD"" Christmas clunker are terribly shoddy.  Wendt and Lloyd, who have both had much better days doing ""Cheers,"" ""Alice In Wonderland,"" ""Bye Bye Birdie""  and ""Taxi"" and ""Back To The Future"" films, respectively,  don't seem too happy to be in this movie, for painfully obvious reasons. The best that can be said about ""Santa Buddies"" is that it is occasionally cute. But it is the type of Christmas movie that parents might put in the DVD player to act as a ""video babysitter"" for their children while they are otherwise too busy or too stressed out during the holiday season.

1153054,"I practiced yoga with this DVD this morning for the second time and thoroughly enjoyed it.  My favorite thing about this DVD is that it includes headstand and shoulderstand.  If I only do two poses per day, those are the two that I will do.  When I practice to most other DVDs I have to pause and do my headstand / shoulderstand practice, or add it on to the end.  In addition, I appreciate that it is headstand on forearms with a longer hold, vs many videos that only come into tripod headstand from prasarita padottonasana (spelling?).  She holds headstand for a couple minutes, which if you want to hold it longer you can just continue and back up the DVD when you are finished.The practice included appropriate counterpose and felt very balanced.  There are two women practicing to voice over.  One woman will occasionally show the less advanced version of the pose.  A couple of times I looked at the screen and they were moving a bit ahead of the instruction, but I tend to not look at the screen too much.  I love the option to have no music, as I prefer to practice without most of the time.The DVD description indicates that this is for intermediate and advanced students, which of course is very subjective.  Advanced yogis may feel it is easy while beginners may feel it is very advanced.  I would say that it is not for a beginner in any way as you should already have learned headstand and other advanced poses.  This DVD was described as a practice DVD and not an instructional DVD.  There is some binding in side angle pose and other non-beginner poses include bird of paradise, mermaid pose, and jump backs from bakasana (crow).  If you are a yogi that likes a fast paced sweaty practice filled with lots of arm balances and extremely advanced poses this may also not be your cup of tea.Honestly, I think that if you are an advanced practitioner it is good to always remember to keep the beginners mind.  I feel great benefit even from the most basic beginner level practices if I am focusing on alignment and remaining present with my breath.  It doesn't always have to be the most physically challenging practice in order to feel benefit.  I find that this DVD has a balance of challenging poses and simple poses to create a perfect balance of doing and undoing.  I will be using this DVD for years to come.","Vinyasa Flow Yoga, Grace, Power, Surf, and Sunset, Intermediate & Advanced, a ***Practice ***"
569379,"""The Fortune Cookie"" is full of laughs with the great duo of Walter Matthau and Jack Lemmon.  It is a cynical comedy showing human nature and how money can corrupt.  TV-cameraman Harry Hinkle (Lemmon) is covering a football game when Boom Boom Jackson (Ron Rich) a football player trying to make an extra 5 yards runs over him on the sidelines.  Willie Gingrich (Matthau) his brother-in-law is a ambulance-chasing attorney who sees a chance for a major settlement.  He pleads with Harry to exaggerate the extent of his injury and then sues the football team, the network and the stadium for a vast amount of money.  Meanwhile  Boom Boom feels guilty he has injured a man so badly, and suspends his career to care for Willie.  Willie calls in Harry's ex-wife when Harry starts to waffle on carrying the scheme forward.  Harry's ex wife (Judi West) is an aspiring singer whose renewed compassion for Willie, seems to be enhanced by the thought of money.

The assignment eventually becomes the context for her entire life, until her very sense of self is wrapped up in layers of deceit and betrayal.Ang Lee's masterful film introduces us to our characters when they are young college students swept up in idealistic fervor and then rejoins them years later when they are older and wearier, fighting the same battle more out of necessity than idealism.  This is a long film because Lee takes his time fleshing out these characters, but it is time well spent.  I was thoroughly engrossed and shattered by the film's harrowing conclusion.",N/A

1408103,"Here we are at last, the final installment of the Dallas releases, the tv-movies.  I'll go over them film by film.  First up is the Early Years, a great prequel film from 86 written by series creator David Jacobs.  It is interesting in it's way, although not entirely in sync with the show.  Next is JR Returns, the first reunion sequel.  This is a great film, providing an excellent resolution to the series with a great sense of continuity and finality.  It was written by Dallas masters Leonard Katzman and Art Lewis and directed by Katzman, who died shortly before it's release.  As the main man behind all of Dallas except the dream, it is a fitting tribute to him and Swan Song to his show which he ran and crafted for so long.  The next one, War of the Ewings, is not as good, having a new writer come on and in general being extraneous.  Finally, the silly 04 reunion which was already on another season release is also going to be here.  It's just the cast hanging around as themselves and frankly doesn't do much for me.  Nevertheless, it's all great Dallas and is all wonderful to have together.",N/A

386077,"To offer a fresh take on one of the most well known tales ever told, one had better have a solid leading man, and one had better be prepared to inject something new or invigorating into the story. Fortunately for this 1984 adaptation of A Christmas Carol, casting George C. Scott as Scrooge and adapting the script accordingly proved not only to work, but also to elevate the nearly irreproachable source material.It's a tall order to improve upon a story powerful enough to intrigue scores of children even from non-English speaking countries, but Scott and Co. do this with aplomb. What's to add to the grumpy old man, Jacob Marley and the three spirits, the playback of a life and prophecy of impending doom, and the regeneration that follows? George got it right: Scrooge shouldn't be just a grumpy old man - there are scores of grumpy old men all around us; what makes old Ebenezer worthy of this supernatural intervention? - he should be downright evil.The mote of a problem with Dickens' novel is, quite simply, that Scrooge caves in too quickly. Some memories Christmas Past throws back in his face turn him back into clay most pliant, and we see his road to repentance a little too clearly and a little too quickly. One-hundred forty one years later a film's cast and crew show undeniable evidence - not to mention courage - of seeing this problem clearly and correcting it, while still relaying the calculated sentimentality so palpable in the novel.Here, Scrooge isn't just cantankerous; he is icy and utterly immovable, and just plain mean. Most of the extra-biblical dialogue works to the betterment of the story. There's a scene early on when Scrooge visits the `change, and gouges some buyers into buying corn at an exorbitant price. Coming on the heels of his departure from his office where he complained to his employee of having to pay him ""so handsomely,"" the message here seems to be that there's a little bit of hypocrisy lurking not just in Scrooge, but in all of us.This new approach to Scrooge required alterations in the other roles also, most notably the spirits, who must be rougher than we've seen before. Edward Woodward as Christmas Present is grandiose, overwrought, and brilliant. The famous speech about ignorance and want, instead of a well-worded but faintly mealy-mouthed entreaty, scans as a death sentence, which is exactly how Dickens intended it to be.To say the least, the happy denouement is as convincing as Scrooge in his most errant state. The transformation wrought upon Scrooge is completely rewarding to the viewer, due to the many good choices made throughout the film. The acting is good all around, but this is clearly Scott's film. May ""The George C. Scott Version"" haunt you pleasantly, and no one wish to lay it.",A Christmas Carol VHS

1293093,"In a perfect world we wouldn't need undertakers or IRS auditors or for that matter an employment terminator.  In the latter occupation Ryan Bingham (George Clooney) does it so well even if he doesn't particularly like it or dislike it for that matter. To maintain some sense of sanity Ryan engages in casual affairs or keeps a log of his frequent flier miles and takes pride in the comps he's accumulated.  With the current economic climate things couldn't be better for Ryan's field.  Ryan, however, is at a mid-career crisis.  The home office in Omaha wants to keep him off the road by doing internet hook-up firings.  At home in Wisconsin he's reminded of the disconnect with his own roots and family.  At this crossroad Ryan has some serious choices to make.  I found ""Up in the Air"" to be a piece with director Jason Reitman's earlier effort ""Thank You For Smoking"" in that Reitman challenges the audience to sympathize with a central character with an unsavory occupation.  George Clooney is excellent in suggesting the complexities of Ryan.  The real find here is Anna Kendrick as Natalie Keener, Ryan's Ivy League protogee.  Natalie could have come off as an automaton but Kendrick mines the humanity and humor of the character.  Vera Fermiga is alright but essentially her character is the standard girlfriend part.  The accolades drawn by the film seem have caused a negative reaction among some viewers.  Divorce it from the hype you will find it is an excellent film.",N/A

1252510,"I was beginning to hold out some hope (however little) that the Oscars might have been steering away from political correctness and social appeasement when, last year,Slumdog Millionairetook home 8 of the 10 categories it was nominated in, including Best Picture. A ""feel-good"" movie made on a $15 million budget with no-name actors, it came out of nowhere and blindsided many viewers and Academy voters. Pleasantly surprised, I flipped on the Oscars this year (2010) and watched the who's who for films in 2009.I'm not going to take any large swings as THE HURT LOCKER because it was a good movie. I enjoyed the action, the tension, the acting. It was all nicely pulled together. But, out of the ten Best Picture nominees this year, was it really the stand-out? I felt that the Academy was slipping, once again, into the realm of trying to be ""significant"" and ""modern"" by voting for something that's on everyone's mind (the war in Iraq). Again, the movie was okay. Good. Adequate. But head-and-shoulders above such films asInglourious Basterds?District 9?Up in the Air? I humbly disagree that it was. And there was nothing in it that we haven't seen before: a war movie with internal angst and a man lost amidst society when he returns home. Jeremy Renner (28 Weeks Later) did a fine job as the risk-taking Sergeant James but, again, he was channeling every other warrior brought into a tough situation that we've seen on celluloid a gazillion times.From reading what you've read of my review so far, you might think that I'm being more critical of the Academy than the film. That's partially correct. But when so much attention is heaped upon one film (including Best Director ...which we'll cover in a moment) and so many people think that this is ""the film to watch"" and not the other nominees that won little or nothing, I believe of informing those who might choose to read this of their folly should they not see something like District 9 or -- one that didn't even get mentioned --Moon.Let's hit on the Best Director item...No female director has ever won an Oscar before Kathryn Bigelow did for The Hurt Locker. So what! We never elected a black President before Obama. Does that mean we should give him every break just because no other black man has ever sat in the White House? No! You win because you deserve to win, not because it's never happened to someone of your kind before. Was the directing of The Hurt Locker better than Inglorious Basterds? Was it? Sorry, but I completely disagree if you think it was.I will say that I'm glad AVATAR didn't win Best Picture or Best Director. But to completely blank out such phenomenal films as DISTRICT 9 and other worthy competitors is simply ridiculous.I think it's important for me to say here that I completely support our troops in Iraq and Afghanistan; they risk their lives daily so that I can live the life I do over here in the U.S. They risk they're lives so that I can write something like this about a film they may care deeply about. But caring deeply about a subject like The Hurt Locker and elevating it above other films does a disservice to the art of film-making and film-makers when you over-rate a movie based on it's significance in the world today and not on its art.For me, the top films of 2009 were DISTRICT 9, INGLORIOUS BASTERDS and MOON. Two got a smidgin of notice and one never saw the light of the Oscar ballots. Check those films out before deciding where the awards should've landed for movies made in 2009. Please.",N/A

She freaked me out sometimes. I have to say the scene where Sybil as a little girl and young dancing Danny is so cute. A lot of the scenes were indeed long and dramatic. I was thinking, ""Wow, she must have had a lot of energy"". It made me tired just to watch Sybil during her episodes. Also, it made me wonder how someone with a multiple personality disorder functions in society. Sybil loses her job and boyfriend. I wondered how far Richard would last. He was so funny and kind, but he really had no idea what he was in for. Sybil tries to find the meaning of love. Her mom was so skitzo and psychotic that she mistreated poor Sybil to the point of being unable to feel love. She was so scared and trapped with all the pain from the physical abuse.

1297226,"""Planet Hulk"" was directed by Sam Liu based on the comic book by Greg Pak. In this story, the Hulk has been deported by Iron Man from Planet Earth via a space shuttle and crash lands on another planet. Once there he is captured, enslaved, and forced to compete in gladiator games.This story feels like a complete rip-off of the movie ""Gladiator"" directed by Ridley Scott in 2000. The Hulk is forced into combat in a series of fights, first with other slaves, then with big monsters and robots, then a very scary opponent in golden armor, before finally facing the Red King. When the Hulk starts gaining fame from the fans that he doesn't even want, the Red King hesitates to end his life fearing the reaction and by prolonging it, Hulk grows more popular and the people begin to regard him as their savior from legend.The Red King's main bodyguard is Caiera, found by him after her village was attacked by little spiders that make people into really spiky zombies. She is almost invincible and indestructible with a gift for battle but slowly has her doubts about the Red King's decisions, much like the Emperor's sister in ""Gladiator.""Beyond the obvious similarities, the character development remains very shallow for Hulk. He focuses on being angry, stubborn, and destructive throughout the story and we are given little insight into his motives. He just likes to smash things and is out for himself, not much of a team player. In a round table discussion with the other slaves that Hulk isn't a part of, two of them reveal a bit of their back stories since they are relevant to foreshadowing future events, but the other two do not.The movie feels like it has a really slow beginning and it took a while to really get into it. The battle sequences are excellent complete with green blood squirting out of the Hulk whenever someone manages to land a punch on him. Once his green blood makes contact with this planet's soil, little green plants grow making his comrades a little more tolerant of his behavior and less skeptical about claims of his savior-ness. By the last thirty minutes of the film, it grew more exciting and though it was very predictable, it had some satisfying moments nonetheless.This could be a good watch for your kids and the story will free fresh to them if they haven't seen ""Gladiator."" If you were only mildly interested in this movie, you can skip it. The story is very much the same with Marvel characters replacing them on an alien planet. However the ending might be different....",Planet Hulk
1295385,"Avatar is little more than a propaganda film to make Americans look bad.Why some Yanks spend money on this is beyond me.Avatar begins with the now VERY familiar premise that humanity has used all its natural resources and now must look elsewhere for its necessities.The 'futuristic' (Set in the year 2154) dialogue even contains the phrases ""shock and awe"" and ""daisy cutter"".  While ""American"" is never uttered, every word spoken by an evil ""human"" was in an ""American"" accent.The Blue People were so preposterously pure and the (American accent) earthlings so preposterously wicked.

Oh, and we're destroying the environment, clearing precious giant trees and natural landscapes and killing rare animals and their habitats, in order to invade and harvest valuable substances under the ground.

559757,"Solid production values, exemplary location underwater photography, aname-dropping cast of vintage Hollywood celebrities, and a terrificfight between an octopus and two killers whales make ""Beyond the Door""director Ovidio G. Assonitis's ""Jaws"" horror movie rip-off ""Tentacles""worth watching. Basically, this movie concerns a giant squidterrorizing a coastal American town. This octopus doesn't discriminatewhen it comes to its diet. You can be an infant, an adult with a pegleg, a beautiful bikini clad dame, or an entire yacht itself and theeponymous predator will dine on you.Incidentally, though it isn't visible that often, the octopus looksbelievable, not like the octopus in the Ed Wood classic ""Bride of theMonster"" (1955) that Bela Lugosi flailed around with in a hilariousscene. The octopus with Lugosi was clearly phony just as it was clearLugosi was controlling every move that the octopus made. Additionally,this octopus looks better than the ""20,000 Leagues under the Sea""octopus. Happily, ""Tentacles"" isn't laughable, and Assonitis andcompany maintain a straight-faced, serious attitude toward theseshenanigans and refrain from camping up the plot.Sadly, the chief flaw in the screenplay by a quartet of scribes--StevenCarabatsos, Tito Carpi, Jerome Max, and Sonia Molteni--for thisatmospheric creature feature is the shortage of sympathetic characters.Most of the suspense is undermined because only one of the stars windsup in jeopardy. Nevertheless, any movie that opens with an infant in ababy carriage serving as the initial snack for a gigantic squid cannotbe one-hundred percent bad. Indeed, Assonitis and his scenarists do asplendid job of setting up the storyline, better than Spielberg didwith ""Jaws."" Underwater construction and the use of radio is whatprompted the squid to prey on humanity and once it has had a taste ofblood, it cannot assuage its appetite. The stalking scenes from theoctopus' perspective breed a sense of unease and eventually the sightof the squid traveling on top of the water like a submarine is kind ofcreepy. In fact, this ""Jaws"" rip-off anticipates ""Jaws 2"" byendangering a fleet of young boaters during a regatta. Unlike ""Jaws,""""Tentacles"" provides a reason for the appearance of the ravenousoctopus.After a baby in a carriage and a peg-legged sailor vanish in the oceanin separate incidents, Sheriff Robards (Claude Akins of ""Return of theSeven"") and newspaper reporter Ned Turner (John Huston of ""TheDeserter"") investigate their disappearance. The bodies for the mostpart have been reduced to skeletons. A horribly decayed corpse washesup out of the drink at one point to scare a couple necking on a boat,but the rest of the victims have had their flesh peeling from theirbones and the marrow sucked out of them. Sheriff Robards warns Turnernot to sensationalize the story until they obtain more information.Perceptively, Turner observes that it all adds up to a nightmare.Meanwhile, Mr. Whitehead, President of Trojan Construction (Henry Fondaof ""The Grapes of Wrath"") reminds Turner to not draw hasty conclusionsunless he can furnish the facts to back them up. Turner believes thatWhitehead's company and their underwater construction are to blame. Ofcourse, Turner is right, but he doesn't get an opportunity to bask inhis beliefs. Whitehead discovers that overzealous engineer John Corey(Cesare Danova of CBS-TV's ""Garrison's Guerrillas"") in an effort toaccelerate the construction violated regulations. Whitehead ordersCorey to stop his illegal activities.Turner goes out of town to consult with Will Gleason (Bo Hopkins of""The Wild Bunch"") who is a scuba diver and ocean-going expert. He hastrained two killer Orcas and sends two underwater experts to the townto investigate for him. The giant squid attacks them when they go downto check out the ocean floor. Eventually, Gleason arrives in town withhis wife to conduct the investigation himself. The day that he is noton his yacht, the octopus attacks the yacht and sinks it. In the middleof all this mayhem the squid eats Gleason's wife. Gleason brings in histwo whales. The last half-hour of ""Tentacles"" depicts the strugglebetween Gleason and his two Orcas with the huge octopus. Watching theOrcas tangle with the squid is like watching angry dogs tear into abear. During the fight, the octopus touches off an underwater avalancheand Gleason is trapped.Assonitis has made a better-than-average octopus opus, but the filmlacks the general air of terror and enough scary scenes to make it agoose-bump inducing horror chiller. Fonda confines himself to hishouse, while the Huston character and the Winters' character arebrother and sister.

1170853,"Given that stars Tina Fey and Amy Poehler are both very talented, one might expect that Baby Mama (2008) would be funnier, and more entertaining than it is.  There are some laughs, but no really big ones, in what is a moderately entertaining, tasteful, comedy with a warm romantic element, mainly due to Fey, and an understated and believable performance by Greg Kinnear.Kate Holbrook (Fey) is thirty seven, lives in Philadelphia, and because her T shaped uterus is apparently an impediment to being able to conceive a child, she turns to a fertility clinic run by Chaffee Bicknell (Sigourney Weaver), to find a surrogate mother.  Prospective mother Angie Ostrowski (Poehler) agrees to carry Kate's child, and after being artificially inseminated, apparently becomes pregnant.  Angie moves into Kate's apartment after splitting up with her common law husband Carl Loomis (Dax Shepard).  Rob Ackerman (Kinnear) the owner of a fruit smoothie establishment, begins a relationship with Kate, who keeps the surrogacy matter a secret, while she continues attending pregnancy classes with Angie.  Deception becomes the name of the game, as the scam Angie and Carl are running, becomes a court case.  Then it's baby time, as things end up happily ever after.Written and directed by Michael McCullers (SNL), the screenplay seemingly targeted at women thirty and over, is smart, and mostly plays it safe, without getting too daring, edgy or vulgar.  The ""girls night out"" scene, is about as wild as it gets.  Produced by Lorne Michaels, the film is nothing like either SNL or Fey's 30 Rock.  Poehler and Fey are both great at what they do, and are great together.  There are some slightly weird characters, but only Kate's boss Barry, played by Steve Martin, even rises to the level of being slightly annoying.  Romany Malco is quite amusing as Oscar, the overly concerned doorman at Kate's building.  Maura Tierney (ER), and Holland Taylor (Two And a Half Men) are also in the cast.Baby Mama isn't a laugh riot, but watching Tina Fey and Amy Poehler play off of each other is a good time, and there's just enough of the charming Mr. Kinnear to provide a nice romantic spark.  The film should strike an appropriate and humorously resonate note, with its intended audience.",N/A

389288,"Im not going to review this particular production, theres over 1700 reviews here already what can I say that has not been said. So I will rather do a comparison between this Firth version and the later version which I will call the knightley version. So allow me pray to copy over what I reveiwed there:I bought both versions at the same time the Firth 1995 and the Knightley version. Which to watch first was my initial dilemma. I decided on the above shorter 2hr. Knightley version first and it was the right decision after having now watched watched both versions. Unlike any devout P&P; fan and not having seen either versions before, I at least can watch it for what it is without any pre-conceived notions. It wasnt long into watching this version which I will call the Knightley version, that I noticed a problem with the sound. I couldnt work out if it was me, the player or the transfer. Five to ten minutes in and I said to myself I cant the heck make out what theyre talking about. Dialogue was drowned out by over-powering background music and ran so fast. I had no choice but to start it again and put the subtitles on which as pointed out by another reviewer were often 3 liners and placed which was a nuisance. For that alone I had to drop 1 star when I would have awarded it 5 stars.Sure there was 'Poetic License' taken in this Knightley version. Like theyre manor was more like a farmhouse and very rough and hardly an upper middle to high class. Donald Sutherland though a great actor imho didnt suit his part, he hardly resembled the English Gentleman of his time, more like Colonial America civil war period. These things aside I found the Knightley version to be more dynamic then the Firth version. This version gave more goose bumps, lumps in throat and emotional tears. Knightley was perfect in her role she was more dynamic and head strong then in previos version. What you didnt see in this 2 hr.version I saw in the Firth version to fill in the gaps. Which is why I decided on the right version to start of my viewing. So all in all, dont miss this version, it was beautiful even with some of its flaws. It is as I say far more dynamic then the previous Firth version. I also preferred Darcy in this version.If you found this review helpful at all please vote on it. Thanks. Pleasant viewing.",Jane Austen's Pride and Prejudice Six Piece Collector's VHS
1318857,"""True Blood"" sucks. Season 3 sucks most of all. And not in a sexy, vampire-sucking kind of way. It sucks as in it BLOWS CHUNKS.I'm sorry. I know there are a lot of die-hard fans of this show out there, and I do not mean to offend, but in my opinion, this show has really tanked. I think the Sookie Stackhouse books are terrible, so it doesn't surprise me that I don't like the show. However, I thought Season 1 was a vast improvement over the book, and then Season 2 went downhill really fast, and Season 3 is so bad it's ridiculous. The plots are stupid, the characters are all over the place, and it's just painful to watch.I think the season finale was a major letdown and the way Eric, Bill, Pam, and Sookie dealt with the whole Russell situation was just plain idiotic. We all know Sookie has zero brain cells in her gap-toothed head, but surely Eric and Pam could have been able to come up with a better plan. PLEASE! Jason is usually one of the only tolerable characters on the show, but he was stuck with that annoying Crystal chick all year, which was a total bust. I've hated Tara since Season 2, which is a shame since she started off as a decent character, but these days I just want to slap her. (At least she chopped off that nasty hair at the end of the season.) Then there's Sam...I don't even know where to begin. A few episodes before the finale, everything about Sam's past took on a crazy new dimension, and it just made no sense at all.The only good think about Season 3 is that women were treated to a few Eric butt shots, which was a refreshing change since the gratuitous nudity on this show is generally 90% female.Aside from Eric's backside, EVERYTHING ABOUT THIS SHOW IS STUPID! Why, when HBO created masterpieces like ""The Sopranos,"" ""Sex and the City,"" and ""Six Feet Under"" (another Alan Ball show, only decent) did the network decide to crank out this garbage?! It makes me sad. (And before you give me grief for watching a show I despise, I only do it because my husband likes it. Obviously I am a REALLY good wife!)",N/A

The sitting is an old family manor with a rich history and a tragic family secret.Usually, a horror film has a dark and stormy night.  In this case it is a snowy night which cuts off the nine friends and two house staff from the outside world.After having a dinner party and plenty of drinking, things begin to unravel when an accident in the library reveal an ancient book hidden behind a wall.  It tells a tragic story of Murray, a Scottish patriot who is tortured by the British.  The graphic description of this torture is a horror story in itself.One by one the friends are murdered as Murray takes his revenge.  The plot does have some gaps, but the story is compelling.There are some moments of horror.  The blood is not in your face.  It's more subtle and realistic.The young cast does a good job with this script.

This movie feels more of a science fiction movie than compared to being a horror film that the franchise has come to known as.  I'm not saying that's a bad thing but it's like a interesting idea to move Jason away from the typical of what we've come to know about his character, still killing people even in space.

1240505,"This is a wonderful indie movie that manages to be several things.It's moving, funny, biting, sad, touching, unpredictable, wrenching, and uplifting--all without being sappy or Hollywoodesque in the least.It's also great social commentary: an acid satire on the American Dream running into the sands in New Mexico and dying, often by suicide.Yet the satire is never heavy handed.  Sunshine offers only glancing blows, quick and telling, and lets the chips fall where they may.Rose's high-school friends are portrayed as having the most shallow and vapid of lives (their idea of fun is to eat chocolate feces out of diapers at a baby shower), yet they are good hearted and just as much victims of their empty surroundings as the more tragic, down-on-their luck suicides and trailer dwellers near them.The opener, the sporting-good suicide, is treated as just a bother: a blood spattering mess to clean up.  (Wonderful touch: the suicide sprays his breath with Binaca before doing the deed.)But as the movie progresses, Rose and Nora move beyond the physical horror of their job (cleaning up death-scenes, usually violent) to the worse psychological horrors and sad, cluttered loneliness that produced them.The characterization is spectacular, the scenery stark and beautiful and sterile, the acting wonderful.Nothing is resolved, exactly, but the characters all develop before your very eyes.",N/A
442762,"Viewed: 10/06Rate: 610/06: Day of the Dead is a much better picture than Dawn of the Dead, but of course as expected, not as the same as Night of the Living Dead. There are some points I liked about Day of the Dead that drew some interesting things. After an hour of Day of the Dead, it started to get better and shaped into a genuine horror picture despite the fact there were some awful lame-brained characters and bad acting. The concept of a mad scientist trying to create civilized behavior out of the living dead is a sure-fire way to create a picture out of Day of the Dead, but the thought of it is reasonably unsound because they are dead already. Of course, I am impressed with the nice touch by making Bub a seemingly human being instead of a brain-dead zombie. I know the intelligence behind the picture is very low, and I had this bright idea, which was already spoken in the picture, which is simply abandon the army idiots and start a family with that woman. It's not a question of morals but an obligation. Then, they can begin a systemic eradication by some sort of a way in doing it quicker. After all, the four were pretty smart to know better. Day of the Dead doesn't really start the movie until the last 30 minutes, which turned out well for better. A lot of great special effects by Tom Savani. I would call Day of the Dead a more true horror film and a better picture than Dawn of the Dead.",N/A

I'm a huge Elvis fan, but this lousy film is in no way better than his previous films, except for the aspect of eye candy for the guys...in the form of Ann Margret. She is definitely the star of this movie, and it's quite obvious that the director purposely exploited Margret's beautiful face and figure to overcompensate for the terrible script. It starts off interesting enough, albeit quite corny in places (especially in the songs), but I expected that and accepted it for what it was. However, the story just gets weaker and weaker, until the end where the time span between the climax and the end of the movie is about 30 seconds. And absolutely no twists or turns in the plot to make it interesting...just blah, the end. Just an awful movie, sorry.I really like Jailhouse House and King Creole--those were great flicks, and not just compared to Elvis's other movies. Even Blue Hawaii was much better than Viva Las Vegas. 4-1/2 stars as an overall rating??? Unbelievable. I guess all 4-1/2 stars go to Ann-Margret rather than the movie in general.

1161187,"I watched my first Jean-Pierre Melville film, Le Samourai, a few months ago.  His style excited me so I decided I needed to watch everything he'd done.  Un flic was my second choice mainly because of Alain Delon.It opens with the most beautiful bank robbery I've ever seen on film.  Melville orchestrates such an elegant gloom; his use of the elements and natural light is remarkable. I was mesmorized immediately and stayed that way throughout most of the movie.Then came the train heist.I watched with a friend, and our post-discussion centered directly on how poorly this fairly large chunk of the film was executed. ""The train reminded me of the special effects I used to enjoy on Mister Roger's Neighborhood,"" said my companion.  I could only wince and nod.  The train was obviously fake, but worse than that was the tiny helicopter hovering overhead.  It had the sort of prop strings a VCR would pick up.(We fabricated a theory about the difficulty of filming this at night because a real helicopter is shown landing in the daylight the following morning.  Perhaps this was the problem?)I hate to pick this movie apart, and I don't mean to deter someone from watching it, but in my opinion this was awkward enough to interrupt the flow of a gorgeous film, hence my three-star rating.  Please keep in mind, Dirty Money was filmed in 1972, not 1952.  I found the bump unforgivable.If you're not bothered with this, by all means, buy the movie.  The acting is wonderfully calculated and stoic; a glorious Melville constant, from what I hear.  Fantastic cars everywhere.  Softly resonating street lights pulsing along the Paris cityscape....and nobody slaps like Alain Delon.There are still some treasures here.- t -9 July, 2010",Dirty Money

He doesn't hate America in spite of what has happened.A woman gets into his cab, clearly upset about her own personal issues. She asks to be driven downtown and has the cab driver park outside a house where she cries when she sees a man, woman, and child arriving home. She keys the car, and then shows the cab driver a picture of the man, woman, and child, with herself. She says she is a producer of Reality TV Shows, like ""Sorry, Haters,"" a show that displays the lavish lifestyles of rappers to induce envy in viewers. Her husband is an artist, and the woman is their nanny; but she and her husband are estranged, and he is now with the nanny.The cab driver is anxious to get home, as he needs to bring some money to his brother's wife. She is not ready to go home. He will drive her around, but needs to make a quick stop. As he is talking to his brother's wife, she barges in and intrudes on their life. On hearing about his brother's plight, she offers to try to get him a lawyer, but instead she steals the money he has saved to help him. His situation goes from bad to worse. He goes back to her office to find out why she pretended to want to help him, but then went about trying to destroy him.The film doesn't really answer this riddle, but we do learn that Phoebe was not really who she said she was. She has more baggage than a sky cap the day before Thanksgiving. The tag for this film was: The dust has finally settled... for most of us. It delves into the anxieties and fears we have in a post 9/11 America, and also tackles the equally perplexing problems of loneliness, alienation, and mental illness. The film seems prescient about certain events like the arrest of Jihad Jane.This indie film was shot in 15 days and takes on many complex and troubling issues. It doesn't really attempt to answer any of the questions it raises, but it does make you think about them. This film is not for everyone. It eschews the happy ending. Does it ever.

1253586,".......................................................................(THIS REVIEW CONTAINS  SPOILERS)..........................To make a long story short, I was there for Toy Story 1 and 2, played the video games, had some Toy Story folders, and other merchandise growing up. So you can bet I was excited to see they were coming out with a 3rd Toy Story movie. Went to see it a couple of days ago...and maybe it's because I was a bit tired (Thanks to some people who parked in front of my house at 5:00 AM and woke me up when they started talking and bouncing a basketball while I had my bedroom windows open)that I didn't take to this movie.First things first, I didn't like the beginning. It seemed very rushed and forced upon you. The toys all started freaking out that they were going to get donated,and that's all we heard. Even if there was little proof of it happening. Then Andy opens the attic door and it closes when he walks away. Andy set the bag with the toys RIGHT UNDER THE PULL DOWN ATTIC DOOR and his mom just assumes it's garbage and puts it on the curb?!?! Okay, she didn't take notice of where the bag was at?!?! I mean, maybe Andy didn't get the time yet to open up the attic door and put his toys away!!??!Also, a LOT of cool toys from the original two movies are gone,which is to be expected.  kids do get rid of stuff overtime and a lot of parents love putting things out for yard sales, but the problem is no one is there in their place. Sure they tried to put other toys in this movie from the day care or from Bonnie's house, but MOST of those toys, beside the hedgehog, Ken, and Hugs-A-Lot Bear have little or no on screen time for you to get a feel for them as a character, learn their personality, or become attached to them. They are just bland faces. I'd rather have Wheezy, Etch-A-Skeetch, the little blue robot, RC Car, the small plastic snake, and LASTLY BO PEEP....Getting rid of Bo Peep was dumb. She was a pretty big secondary character right next to Ham, Rex, and Mr. Potato Head. Also, Hugs a Lot is a complete Jerk...in every sense of the word. He doesn't even bring across that ""love to hate them"" type feeling, like ""Darth Vader"" or other really cool bad guys. He's just extremely mean and down-right nasty, especially considering what he did at the end of this film. I hated having him in this movie!Which brings me to next point, without interesting characters, the clever banter and humor between toys was missing in this one. No funny one liners or jokes that adults would only get. Just BLAH. Oh sure, the story had a plot and it unfolded decently, and the characters said enough, but I was looking for it to be fun along the way as well.Another thing is, the childhood innocence Andy had while playing with his toys in the first two movies is missing. Instead, Andy is grown up and we have his replacement Bonnie, whom I just didn't like. She seemed goofy...and I hate to say that about a child character, but I just didn't care for her at all. When she was playing with the toys it made me feel weird, awkard, and uncomfortable.Which brings me to my last reason for not really liking this movie, the ending. I wanted Andy to go put his toys in the attic, and then the toys live on together and are happy. One day down the road, Andy would be going through the Attic, come upon his old toys, pull them out, and fall in love all over again. He might have even tracked down another Etch a Sketch, Bo Peep doll, or RC car that he keeps at his own house for his kids or because he regretted giving them away.  BUT...I didn't get that sense of closure. So give me something else worthwhile!Pixar and Disney said, ""NO!"" So what happens is Andy is going to put his toys in the Attic, but Woody puts a post it note on the box to please donate the toys. So Andy takes them Bonnie's house and they play with the toys together. Now I think this part of the movie was really botched...We could have seen Andy playing with his toys again FOR OLD TIMES SAKE, possibly in slow motion and accompanied to some slow and mellow music. Maybe we could have seen some flashbacks to when he played with them before, when he was younger. You know something to really makes us feel sad about the loss of childhood innocence that has taken place? But instead, Andy plays with the toys as if he doesn't really care, no real emotion what so ever. Like it's no big deal.Then he goes back to his car, and gets in. He's looking at his toys for a long time with a VERY sad look in his face because he's leaving behind toys he still wants. I kept saying to myself,"" Go back for them then if you are going to miss them!!!"" But Andy just drives off, the toys stand on Bonnie's front porch, and the camera pans upward toward the sky...THAT'S MY SENSE OF CLOSURE?!?Then random clips of the toys enjoying their new life comes out and we some of the humor that was so lacking in the film. In my opinion, this movie's ending was horrible. What Pixar should have done is added all the credit scenes of the toys enjoying their new life to the end of the film, and made that the end. You know, a sense of closure that the toys were going to be all right. Maybe have ""You've got a friend in me"" playing to the montage to let us know things are back the way they used to be and the toys are enjoying themselves again.But instead, this movie's end feels like a set up for a new movie...I sense Toy Story is going to head the way of A LOT of Disney movies and go down the path of not as appealing, quick cash in, Direct to Video sequels. Toy Story 3 was ALMOST a direct to video movie...So I wouldn't be surprised at all if this happened! So forget about me getting that sense of closure I was talking about earlier, instead I got a way for Disny and Pixar to dig the franchise up and bring it back to life whenever they want to! Life Lesson 101: Sometimes it's good when something good ends before it has the chance of going on for too long and becoming stale.I did however, like the idea of Mrs. Potato Head using her missing eye to see Andy, and how Mr. Potato head transferred himself to a wrap for a taco...but did anyone else think he looked like the Mr. Potato head parody character on Mad Tv's old spoof of Toy Story? Coincidence?Also, I did like the part near the end where the toys were going to get melted. They did that well,and it really had me worried and brought out some emotion in me. Thus, making me care. Thus, making me like that scene.Overall, I liked this movie. But it can't hold a candle to the first toy released years ago. However, I'd still recommend seeing it at least once, or buying a copy when it released.",Toy Story 3

However, I doubt that in today's navy I could enjoy the camaradery of yesteryear, due to the presence of women in the service.The series presents both Marines and Navy as very professional, with much saluting and polite conversation between men and women.My Navy, between 1939 and 1960, was less demanding in regards to the ""daily"" routine.  We observed protocol, as required, but not to the extent of that which is portrayed in the JAG series.Overall, the Navy was very educational and I'm thankful for my present retired status.One thing the series has revealed to me is the dedication and commitment of the U.S. Marine Corps.",JAG: Judge Advocate General- Season 8

I'm not saying this because I don't enjoy the Stargate franchise to date (I really loved the Frank Lloyd Wright-influenced Atlantis), but because this bold exploration develops entirely new possibilities both in terms of the technical/scientific underpinnings of the show (OK, let's start to explore the entire known universe now) and the dramatic assumptions (Hey, this doesn't have to be about endless battles with bad guys bent on galactic parasitism or domination).Yes, SG-U is a human drama set in the mind-shattering context of (unintentional!) inter-galactic exploration. As a lifelong science fiction fan, that is certainly premise enough to draw me in. And the execution? Novel. Genre-defying. Creative. And in my view, entirely a success in all respects.SG-U will stand as a science fiction classic to be remembered for generations.",N/A

Neon's teaching in this is slow enough that I had no trouble with it, and she is, always, very watchable and approachable.However, Neon's teaching, specifically, because it's so fluid, isn't as hard on an older body.  There are dancers who teach a less fluid style, and I've had trouble trying to practice with their videos because I'm forty, and I've got the kind of injuries you might expect from half a lifetime.  With other videos, I would finish practicing, and things hurt.

1354093,"1 Disc Blu-Ray, released August 24, 2010Oliver Parker has directed Oscar Wilde's plays, ""The Importance of Being Earnest"" and ""An Ideal Husband"" and now turns to his Victorian-era thriller novel, ""Dorian Gray."" It stars Ben Barnes as Dorian Gray, the absolute picture of youth and beauty whose appearance is captured exquisitely in a painting. When asked if he would give up his soul to stay the way he appears in the picture, he says he would and miraculously over time his portrait ages while he does not and Gray's pleasure-filled life spirals out of control.When Gray arrives on the scene in London for the first time, it is after the death of his grandfather. He is swept up into lavish parties and meets Lord Henry played by Colin Firth who encourages him to indulge in every pleasurable sensation and lead the life he wishes he could. Gray is at first an innocent, but the influence of Henry is undeniable as the two continue to go out on the town. Lord Henry's friend Basil Hallward is a society artist who paints the portrait and declares it possibly his best work and doesn't understand why Gray won't let him borrow it back for a gallery show he wants to put on.Ben Barnes is the perfect casting choice as he always seems to glow on screen amongst other characters and backgrounds. His skin appears flawless and with a minor change of expression he can express innocence and love or lust and evil. His change in character over the course of the film is haunting and it certainly helps that the story is so gripping. He rules this entire movie but it certainly helps that he has such an outstanding cast behind him.Case in point, Colin Firth graces the cast with his presence playing a role he excels in as the guy that kind of puts everyone else off. He sweeps Dorian into the high class society encouraging a lack of morality and an excess of naughty behavior. Colin Firth sports a mustache so that is how you know he's a bad influence, but he is not all bad since eventually he has a daughter played by Rebecca Hall that he is very protective of when she becomes drawn to Dorian's charms.Rebecca Hall is such an honest actress who puts forth so much authenticity in her characters, it's always a treat to see her. This role is more average as the quirky daughter attracted to Dorian against her father's will, but go check her out in ""Please Give"" for a really stand-out performance.The Blu-Ray version is gorgeous. This is a movie that benefits from the Blu-Ray treatment being such an elegant period piece and it just makes Ben Barnes' face look more flawless by comparison to everyone else. This classic story modernized is a fantastic soul-selling morality piece and looks great to boot so check it out! Fascinating how new Blu-rays coming out are less expensive than their DVD counterparts....see below.Bonus Features:There is a making-of feature discussing the Oscar Wilde book and its translation to the big screen and how it relates to society today from the perspective of the filmmakers and cast. There are featurettes on the extensive make up and wardrobe for the other cast members until Dorian Gray's fantastic ending, the painting itself and the man commissioned to create it for them, the use of the train station/Smithfield market, and the visual effects of the painting. The costume design photo gallery features Ruth Myers' original sketches come to life played to the soundtrack from the movie.The Deleted Scenes show Dorian Gray facing a woman on her death bed at peace, a little more background on his fiancee's brother in conversation, and an encounter with a mysterious man who seems to know something about the contract. The Blooper Reel is a very proper reel of difficulties with cigarette cases, holding a glass, peering around a corner, and small cases of giggles.",N/A

1285600,"Its almost impossible to discuss this movie without talking about the writer/director Quinten Tarintino.  His style, and fame often overshadow his movies, and certainly are often discussed in connection with reviews for his movies.  A shame, as on its own merits, regardless of the man behind it, inglorious basterds is a very unique and interesting movie.  What surprised me about the movie, is that it is not the traditional movie, as the advertisements led me to believe.  This is not the story of a bunch of military men scalping nazis, but rather a series of independent stories linked to result in a climax involving an alternate end to WWII.  I imagine this movie's merits will be debated for some time, as those seeking blood lust will be disapointed by the shockingly little amount of actual violence, while the art house crowd will decry the sometimes random moments of violence.  Also most of the mainstream will be complain about the abundance of subtitles.  Regardless of these issues, there is something rather great and unique, that makes this one of the better movies of the year, and arguably the best movie of this director's carreer.  If you're tired of the same old, same old, and are looking for something unique that doesn't conform to the usual, this movie is highly recomended.",N/A

1315973,"Who doesn't like a good horror film? Who doesn't like a good comedy? Well then, you might just like I Sell the Dead!The film takes place (presumably) sometime in the early 1800's in England. Arthur Blake (Dominic Monaghan of Lord of the Rings fame) awaits the gallows for the crime of grave robbing. But before he goes to meet his maker he'll confess to an inquisitive priest stories of he and fellow partner Willie Grimes (Larry Fessenden) exploits with the dead and undead alike. The story is a light-hearted, witty dark comedy that fans of horror movies will get a chuckle out of. It moves at a brisk pace but doesn't feel rushed.The acting is simply terrific. Both Dominic Monaghan and Larry Fessenden are perfect in their roles and play off each other well. The rest of the cast is also great bringing this colorfully dark world of grave robbing to life.In the end, I Sell the Dead isn't going to change the way you think about life and it's probably not going to be one of your favorite horror or comedy movies.

1091090,"I bought this MGM holiday package last year and just got around to watching it.  I already had The Bishop's Wife (colorized) that I had taped on VHS and I had Pocketful of Miracles that I bought as VHS and wanted to replace these two on DVD.  I watched The Bishop's Wife on Christmas Day and although it was not colorized it still remains a holiday favorite. It depicts an American culture of a much gentler time, plus, American actresses in the 30s and 40s were much more highly accomplished than their counterparts of today and are a joy to watch.I had read a few negative reviews of Pocketful of Miracles and couldn't understand why.  I thought the movie was wonderful until I started watching it in the MGM version this morning.  I still have a full screen TV and first of all the wide screen aspect was too severe.  Then there was something wrong with the color.  I fiddled around with my color correction for a while but then finally gave up.  If I were watching this for the first time I think I would have given it a poor review as well.  This version has a harshness that is absent in the VHS version.

632655,"Viewed: 10/08Rate: 610/08: Although Coach Carter raises a lot of good points, it also invites several bad points as well. Samuel Jackson was good in his role, and he ought to do more of the same type of work because lately he has been doing crap. Outside of him, the cast was very good turning in surprisingly well-played performances. I find the plot behind Coach Carter to be all too familiar, ringing the feeling of ""been there, done it before."" One thing I hadn't really expected in Coach Carter is how far the discipline went. So, it was a warm welcome for me, and I enjoyed that very much. Moreover, I liked the fact that Coach Carter stresses the idea of ""teamwork"" as well as it did in G.I. Jane plus the fundamental importance of academics before athletics and life before basketball. That's why I liked the movie a lot, and it should relate very well to any teen of today. The basketball scenes featured in Coach Carter are of top-notch and contain really nothing fancy. In other words, I like to think Coach Carter of Hoop Dreams meets Hoosiers. As for the discipline side, it's almost Lean on Me; however, Joe Clark was there first. Now for the negatives of Coach Carter, I thought the profanity to be exceedingly too much for me, and I was incredibly disappointed in the usage of the language by the coach. It's so counterproductive and goes against what I believe in. Never in my life have I ever had a coach who uttered a four-letter word, and believe me, I have had a lot of coaches throughout childhood. Coach Carter should know better than that. Secondly, I was disappointed with lax strictness imposed by the coach especially when his players got caught sneaking away to a party filled with sex, alcohol, and probably drugs. I mean, what was that? That calls for a total expulsion of the players involved. But somehow, the coach swept it under the rug and moved on. I thought also that it was ridiculous that each time a player does something totally against Coach Carter's rules, he later gets taken back in form of begging. It's funny that when I finished the movie, I watched the special feature showing the real coach and the interviews by the former players. I was already informed by the ending of Coach Carter that many of them graduated from college and have degrees, but listening to the way they talk, they sure don't sound educated. Even worse, the coach would say things like, ""We was...,"" and ""They was..."" Come on, I expected a lot more from him. Another disappointing feature about Coach Carter is how good-looking everybody was. Sorry, it doesn't work that way in real world. Actually I found the ages of the actors playing high school basketball players to be hysterical. One of them is 27 when the movie was made; another was 22; another 23; another 26; and one was 31! That's why I knew how falsely portrayed their bodies were when it comes to high school setting. Another disappointment about Coach Carter is its advocate of abortion among teenage girls. That's just a poor message that was being given to impressionable kids and should have been completely dropped as a subplot from Coach Carter. What I said has nothing to do with my views on abortion because that's a very serious matter that ought to be explored elsewhere. Meanwhile, I remember one scene where there was a protest over the lockout, and some Asian dude just pumped his fist out. That was hilarious. Another scene shows a Latino getting gunned down due to a drug deal gone bad. Um, who cares? Is it just me, or do the high school cheerleaders look more like strippers? All in all, despite its MTV label, Coach Carter isn't a bad film but should be urged to be approached with some caution.",N/A

997582,"I cannot believe I've never heard of this film before!  Watched with my friends, and we couldn't stop laughing.  The commentary on racism in America, the Civil War, advertising, and other topics is nothing short of brilliant.  Telling the story in the manner of a Ken Burns documentary (the director says he was influenced by Burns' series on the Civil War) allows constant novelty and interest with very little budget, and the nonstop hilarity gives the message that drop of sugar that helps the medicine go down, even for white Americans who tend to shy away from such a pointed reminder of the terrible crimes of our immediate ancestors.This film was produced by Spike Lee, who handled similar material a few years earlier inBamboozled.  Lee makes it sound like that film tanked because audiences can't deal with the reality of racism, and there's certainly some truth to that, but at less than 1/40th the budget, CSA deals with roughly the same material and succeeds in all the same places Bamboozled fails.CSA was written & directed by Kevin Willmott, a professor of film at the University of Kansas.",N/A
1404570,"First of all, I haven't read the 2005 novel by Kazuo Ishigiro that this film is based on, nor did I know much of anything about it apart from the basics (dystopian English alternate-world story) before seeing the film. So the few problems I mention or areas that I feel the film is deficient in dealing with are wholly a product of my experience with the movie - I suspect that some of these issues might be less problematic in the novel.  As you can see from my rating and review, I think the positives far outweigh the negatives.Second of all, if you know even less than I did, be prepared for **SPOILERS**All that out of the way, what we have here is a story taking place in a roughly contemporary (1978-94) England, a country (and presumably, world) radically changed by medical advances that did not happen in our world. Or...maybe. The most fascinating element of this film to me, and I'm sure the most infuriating to many viewers, is that we never get a really clear picture as to just what the technology is, how things have changed. The focus here is not on technology, on the science fictional aspects, on gadgetry or medicine. We get a few references to cloning, but never any details; we learn fairly quickly that the children we're introduced to at the Hailsham boarding school have a ""special"" destiny, and the film follows three of them in particular, one of whom, Kathy (Izzy Meikle-Small as a child/Carey Mulligan as an adult) narrates the film from 1994 at around the age of 30.Kathy, her companions Tommy (Charlie Rowe/Andrew Garfield) and Ruth (Ella Purnell/Keira Knightley) are all being raised in a comfortable, serene - almost idyllic - countryside school to face a very particular and peculiar destiny. We get several hints early on - but only get the full heartbreaking story from a sympathetic (and summarily dismissed) young teacher named Lucy (Sally Hawkins): the children are all clones who will be harvested for their organs before the age of 30, dying typically after their third or fourth ""donation"". Lucy delivers the news with compassion and sadness; the rest of society, including the leaders of the school and apparently virtually all donors, have simply accepted this new world order, for the sake of the longer lives (we're told in a brief script at the beginning of the film that the average lifespan has passed 100) and comfort it has given them. The donors are essentially regarded as cattle.  Eventually they move on from the school to ""The Cottages"" a few years later in the second third of the film, as the forward and vivacious Ruth has taken up with the awkward and introverted Tommy, which Kathy considered becoming a ""Carer"", helping to take care of the donors before she herself becomes one.  In the last third of the film, 1994, all three confront their inevitable destinies.In most such visions, the story would be about attempts to escape the repressive regime, or overthrow it. The genius and heartbreak of NEVER LET ME GO is that it shows a society - or a very tiny portion of one - that is completely conditioned to the way things are now; nobody even dreams of running away or changing things, and the idea of there being an ethical dilemma is never actually broached by any character until quite near the end of the film. This was, I'll admit, something of a problem for me as I was watching the film - it's really quite hard to take the blind acceptance of such an awful fate on the part of everyone; but I think that Ishiguro and the filmmakers here are making a statement that only seems unrealistic if we forget the history of the last century. I do have a slight problem with the notion that things could have happened so very quickly in a democracy like England, but if we look at something like Orwell's ""1984"" - set 35 years after its publication - as a model, we shouldn't be surprised. The English dystopian vision has always seemed a particularly mordant and immediate one. And setting the film in essentially our time also allows it to be made much more cheaply - it's ""science fiction"" certainly, but it doesn't require the kinds of sets and effects that we usually think of the genre as having nowadays.I think that another factor that is going to be problematic for many is that we just see a very small fraction of this society, which must be so very different in many aspects but which looks essentially the same to we viewers. We are kept in the presence of our three main characters throughout, and we never see the recipients of any of these peoples' ""gifts""; we never encounter the government; we never hear anyone from outside of their little world express an opinion. For me this helped keep the exquisite sadness and intensity of the growing sense of loss that these young people had fresh and vivid throughout, and without encumbering the actual film with external voices, we are allowed to consider all the ethical ramifications and meanings of this changed world entirely on our own. The donors could be read as metaphors for slavery; for how we treat animals; for abortion; for the place of women in a man's world; in short, for any way in which the rulers and the majority of a society have treated and continue to treat those without any power. There are several moments where the word ""soul"" is used - though the film has no visible religious agenda, the notion is that the idea of living organ donation is perhaps accepted because the clones are viewed as not having souls, as not being fully human - an argument that was made not so long ago about other kinds of people in the world we live in.The acting and nearly everything about the production is pretty impressive; director Romanek has just made two previous features, ONE HOUR PHOTO and STATIC, over the past 15 years.  I haven't seen either of those, but he has a sure hand here, putting together Alex Garland's screenplay and the performances of the fine ensemble with a minimum of sentimentality or lingering, overt emotion - which if anything serves to increase the power of the storytelling and the ultimate tragedy of the piece. Rachel Portman's music is very low-key, repetetive, insistent; at first it irritated me a bit, but gradually it grew on me, mirroring the ultimately dead-end, resigned lives of the protaganists. Of the cast I have to single out Carey Mulligan, who seems likely to get some of the same kind of awards talk she did a year ago when she burst on the scene in An Education. She has to communicate a calmness, empathy, resignation and yet a flicker of never-ending internal determination and purpose throughout the film, and I don't know that many actresses could have managed.As Orson Welles once said aboutMake Way for Tomorrow, another heartbreaker about the inevitability of fate, it would make a stone cry.

Juliett manages to detonate the nuke in 1977.... which should have prevented the plane from crashing in 2004.... right....wrong....the episode does give us a glimpse of what might have happened if the plane hadn't crashed.... a new reality is formed & we see the characters all going about their normal lives as the plane lands at LAX, this did seem like a neat premise... but it soon gets a bit ridiculous.... like the writers just didn't know where to go with itthen, to top it all off, we learn that the nuke sent our survivors back to 2007....how?? & now we have two realities going on at once.....make sense??...In the alternate never crashed timeline (flash sideways), we see charaters from previous episodes pop up, but there are inconsistencies....like..Sun & Jin are not married in the flash sideways..(how?)Jack, our main hero suddenly has a son who was never mentioned in the first five seasons, too add insult to injury, his ex-wife is not even the kid's mother, Juliett is.....how is this possible??Sawyer.... the show's bad boy....who we learned was con man, but now a undercover police officer with Miles, one of the rescue people in Season 4 as his partner... how is this possible?....Ben...the show's villian & the main antagonist throughout we learned killed his own dad on the island in season 3 in a flashback moment, but somehow, his dad is a old man here...how?..not only that, they try to make us like him....Desmond would have been on the island in this flash sideways in the Hatch no less, but yet, somehow he too is on the plane...again...how is this possible??....now one could argue that he was never there because of the nuke, that is possible, but how likely is it he would have been on the plane..not likely...Hurley is a CEO of the resturaunt that he worked at before hitting the lottery in the flashbacks of his character.... again....how?...Locke is still engaged to his girlfriend who had left him in a previous flashback episode from season 3....but somehow that never happened...also his reason for being handicapped is also different....I won't even try to explain it..Only Kate, Claire, Sayid, & Charlie seem to have a consistent flow in this flash sideways...With Claire still pregnant with her unborn childKate still on the run from the lawSayid being reunited with his long lost loveanother thing this season tried to do was explain the Smoke Monster's origin, we learn that it is the MIB (Man in Black) who has an ongoing fued with Jacob(the Island's protector)....almost like Jesus & Satan....with the MIB wanting to leave the island & Jacob refusing to let him leave....but get this.... they are brothers....o.k....but we never find out why the MIB wants to leave...Early on we are introduced to a group of people in a Pyramid type building who are keeping Smokey out, but we never learn why....let alone where they came from...There is only one really good episode..the name eludes at the moment, where we learn about Richard & why he never ages, we also learn in this episode how the ship came to be stuck in the jungle, this s why I give it two stars.This Season is so inconsistent with the other previous seasons that the writers had to be on crack......it is as if creator J.J. Abrams & others here just handed it to Damon Lindelof & Carlton Cuse & said... ""here, it is yours to finish""& these idiots could'nt come up with a reasonable ending....Like some reviewers have said....it could have ended with Season 5 with them resetting time, that would have been believeable.... & as far as I am concerned....that is where it ended... I will not be getting this one...& I won't even get started on the last episode which was supposed to justify all the inconsistencies that for the most part was a cop out like others have said, I won't even go there.....other reviewers have already done that for me....stick with the first five seasons.....skip this one.",Lost: The Complete Sixth and Final Season
506057,"1927 and after the premiere of the silent romantic comedy ""It"", actress Clara Bow would become the sexiest silent movie star in America during the roaring '20s.Having done well in films such as ""The Plastic Age"" and ""Mantrap"", ""It"" was as if the film was created just for Clara.  The film was inspired by Elinor Glynn's (who pioneered women's erotic fiction) self-titled novel and she would coin the term ""It"" to erroneously describe sex appeal.  And Clara Bow definitely had sex appeal.Bow who would become one of the popular female stars of the Flapper era ( a term from the 1920's to describe liberal young women who defied the norm of acceptable behavior by sporting short skirts, bobbed hair, listened to jazz, wore a lot of makeup and drinking, smoking, driving cars and even being sexual.And Clara Bow embraced her flapper character of Betty Lou Spence in ""It"".  A timeless classic romantic comedy from the Killiam Collection and released by Kino Video via a Deluxe Edition which contains the silent film and also the Clara Bow documentary ""Clara Bow: Discovering the ""It"" Girl"".""It"" begins with Monty Montgomery (played by William Austin"") reading an issue of ""Cosmopolitan"" about who has ""It"", an article about Elinor Glyn's popular book on sex appeal.  As new department store owner Cyrus Waltham Jr. (played by Antonio Moreno) is busy at work and trying to please his childhood friend Adela Van Norman (played by Jacqueline Gadsen), Monty goes to search for a woman that has ""It"".And sure enough, Monty discovers an employee who works over the counter who has ""It"".  A flapper named Betty Lou Spence (played by Clara Bow) who is just enamored by the new owner Cyrus Waltham Jr.Betty Lou dreams that one day she will be Mr. Waltham's woman but for now, she can only dream.Meanwhile, Monty pursues Betty Lou as the ""It"" girl and Betty Lou looks as Monty as a way for her to get to know Mr. Waltham.  Meanwhile, at home, we see that Betty Lou is a woman who doesn't have much money and lives with her friend Molly (played by Priscilla Bonner) who is ill and has a baby.  It appears that because of Molly's illness, the child protective agency wants to take the baby away from her.  But Betty Lou does all she can to calm her nerves and reassure her that things will be OK.As Betty Lou uses her sexual charm on Monty, she has him taking her out to a posh restaurant that Mr. Waltham attends and immediately uses her charm to get his attention, despite Waltham sitting with his fiance/friend Adela.All Betty Lou needs is that short moment in order to use her sexual appeal on Mr. Waltham and sure enough, from the moment Waltham meets Betty Lou, he is enamored and likes her.Everything seems to be going as planned for Betty Lou as she seems to have Mr. Waltham in her grasp but when the child protective services try to take the baby away from her friend Molly, Betty Lou steps in and tells the agency reps that the baby belongs to her.Now Monty and Mr. Waltham try to cope with the news that Betty Lou is a mother of a baby the best they can.  Will Betty Lou now lose her dream man?As for the documentary ""Clara Bow: Discovering the ""It"" Girl"", Courtney Love narrates the documentary featuring interviews with Clara Bow's family and friends and film critics and biographers.  The documentary goes into Clara's turbulent life from having a grandmother and mother who suffered mental problems (note: epilepsy a the time was considered a severe mental disorder), her mother upset that Clara was pursuing acting and one night waking up and seeing her mother standing over her with a butcher knife to her neck to other situations that affected her upbringing.But what was most damaging was because she was such a sex symbol, there were many slanderous false rumors about her which the public believed to Clara Bow being the ""It"" girl during the silent era and during the year of the ""talkies"", having mental breakdowns due to her fear of the mic and going from Paramount's darling to an actress they would literally cut out (unfortunately, a sad story that is attached to many once popular silent film stars).And then ending with her life outside of entertainment with husband and popular Cowboy actor) Rex Bell and hearing her son Rex Bell Jr. talking about the mother he knew during the final stages of her life.VIDEO & AUDIO:It's important to note that many silent films from the 1920's don't fare that well.  Being filmed on nitrate (which deteriorated or caught fire), many silent films are lost or destroyed and what we are left with are classics that range from being good prints to some having massive scratches, debris and flickering.  ""It"" is a film that is more towards the middle.  Some of the scenes show scratches, debris and minor flickering and aliasing.Fortunately, the print quality is definitely watchable and unless there are many other reels out there to create a restored print, this DVD from Kino Video is probably the best we are going to see of ""It"" for now.  Considering this film, is over 80-years-old, I'm not going to complain, I feel that it is fortunate that this film was not lost and that we can watch this film today.As for the documentary, the documentary was made in 1999 and picture quality is very good on DVD.AUDIO:As for audio, although the film is silent, there is music via a piano score by William Perry.  The music works well with this film and captures the mood of the characters.Intertitles are in English.As for the audio of ""Clara Bow: Discovering the 'It' Girl"", Courtney Love did a very good job in narration for the documentary and interviewees and everyone is heard quite well.  No problems whatsoever when it comes to the documentary's audio.SPECIAL FEATURES:There are no special features included in this release.JUDGMENT CALL:""It"" was a satisfying, enjoyable and delightful romantic comedy from the silent era.  Clara Bow exudes beauty and sexiness through her flirtatious eyes, pouty lips and if anything, she knew how to work the camera to with magnificent results.  She embodied the title of ""It"" Girl and it was evident throughout this film that Clara Bow was America's sexiest superstar at that time.I laughed throughout this film because the comedy was well-played.  From Clara Bow's character playing hard-to-get plus an enjoyable date scene between Betty Lou and Mr. Walther in Coney Island.  You can tell the two had a lot of fun and overall pacing and cinematography was fun to watch.But along with this enjoyable film is the documentary ""Clara Bow: Discovering the `It' Girl"".  I had no idea that Clara's life was so turbulent.  From hearing how painful her childhood was, to knowing now that when she sheds a tear on film, those tears were genuine out of grief of a friend who died in a fire in her building and the boy dying in her arms.And what was even more damning was the gossip coverage of her during the 1920's and 1930's.  Way before anyone was suing people for inflammatory accusations, Clara Bow had the worst treatment.  Yes, she was Hollywood's sex symbol and had her share of flings but the rumors about her were so terrible that she was literally beaten.  And the transition from the silent film era to the talkies was not exactly easy for her either.It's unfortunate and heartbreaking that a woman who would be regarded as the ""It"" girl would suffer so much pain in her life but when the camera was on, she made all who viewed her film that she was confident, sexy and happy.  She was a true actress who knew how to give a magnificent performance despite the demons that she faced within her.""It"" and her later film ""Wings"" (which was the first Academy Award winning film) are just two of the films that she's known for but if anything, this DVD release from Kino Video has inspired me to seek out more Clara Bow films.  Her performance on ""It"" was magnificent, the film was enjoyable and fun.Overall, this is one DVD release that silent films want to own and have in their collection.  Watch the magnificent Clara Bow and you too will realize why she was definitely ""It""!`It'/'Clara Bow: Discovering the ""It"" Girl' on DVD is highly recommended!",It VHS
282464,"After the 2nd World War, Clark Gable was rarely able to recreate the excitement of so many of his thirties films. Not only was he ageing of course, but his biographers record that he never got over the loss of wife Carole Lombard in 1942. He was letting himself go. MGM, his home studio, clearly recognised the change and many of his postwar films are a trial. ""Mogambo,"" released in 1953, is a notable exception. John Ford filmed this action adventure and it is minor work in his canon, simply because the filming is straightforward and expert but with no particular Ford imprint.A remake of a previous success, the raunchy and funny ""Red Dust"" from 1932, Gable stars as an African game hunter on safari with 2 worthwhile leading ladies, the sensuous, amusing playgirl, Ava Gardner, and the icy, married Gracy Kelly. The plot is simple. Both woman fall for Gable and the melodrama revolves around how this plays out amongst lots of location shots of the scenary, native tribesmen and animals. Gable is perfectly cast as the macho hero and Gardner hits the right notes to make believable that she, 20 years his junior, would be his sort of woman. Kelly is much less successful and inferior to Mary Astor in the same role in the original film. Being an MGM star production, the ladies look ludicrously immaculate even on safari.The print is excellent preserving the glorious technicolour but there are no extras except the original trailer. The film is best value if purchased as part of the Gable Signature Collection.",N/A
1223432,"if nothing else,this end of the world flick form disaster specialist Roland Emmerich was entertaining.there sure was a lot of CGI used here.in fact probably ninety percent of the movie is comprised of it. December 21,2012 is the day that the Mayans predict a cataclysmic event will occur on earth,which has led to speculation that the world as we know will cease to exist.the movie only makes passing reference of the Mayan's,and instead just focus on on the destruction and mayhem side of things.maybe it's just me,but the special effects don't seems to have improved much in the last six years or so since the The Day After Tomorrow another big budget disaster opus,also from Roland Emmerich,which had a nearly comparable amount of CGI.or maybe i'm just jaded,and CGI really isn't that exciting more.either way,2012 failed to fully engage me,on an excitement level.the movie does however,has one thing in its favour.unlike many flicks of the genre,there were no real maudlin or sappy moments,no over the top corn ball inspirational speeches.and i loved Woody Harrelson's character.i also thought Thandie Newton was good as well.the movie wasn't boring.and for a movie that clocks in at 150 minutes before the end credits roll,that's something.for me,2012 is a 3/5",2012

209304,"Even though 1980 was unfortunately the year of Steve McQueen's tragic, untimely demise, the year should also be remembered in part for the release of his final two finished movies, 'Tom Horn' and 'The Hunter', as they are among his best films. It's, of course, truly unfortunate that McQueen died too early in his career ; he should have gone on to make legions of other films, but there's something so right and spot-on about his characterizations of Tom Horn and Ralph ""Papa"" Thorson here in 'The Hunter', that it's difficult to have imagined better, more fitting final performances for the late actor, who died after suffering a heart attack in a Juarez, Mexico hospital following surgery exactly 30 years ago today.In what would be his final performance, Steve McQueen -- much the same as his previous role -- plays another character inspired by an actual, real-life historical figure: modern-day bounty hunter Ralph ""Papa"" Thorson. Thorson works as a bail-enforcement agent for a bail bonding agency headed by fellow screen legend Eli Wallach tracking down various fugitives across the country. Not nearly as simple as I make it sound here, it is a riveting story with not just plenty of action, but also extensive drama and character development as well. Not only is Thorson forced to contend with the dangers of his job but also with feelings of uneasiness and misplacement in the modern age, as well as his tumultuous relationship with his pregnant girlfriend, (Kathryn Harrold)His exploits as a bounty hunter come back to haunt him as lately he has become the target of a revenge-bent psychopathic junkie (Tracey Walter) that he previously helped bring to justice.There's a number of truly terrific action sequences, including a breathless elevated train chase in Chicago and even more than a few genuinely laugh-out-loud funny scenes which begin as early as the opening credits when Thorson is shown to be a very transportationally-challenged driver.There's also an elegiac sense that Thorson is burned out and at the end of his career (which would be prophetic for McQueen in real life) in that he's tired and has had enough of the game. There's some thematic similarities to McQueen's own previous character of 'Tom Horn', as in both movies depict real-life historical figures, both sanctioned to use force, who made a living of tracking other men and also dealt with the ramifications of a changing society where their line of work is seen as outdated. 'The Hunter' never quite achieves the same poignancy as 'Tom Horn' before it, but Steve McQueen's amazing, fully-realized performance as Papa is more than enough to compensate. It's somewhat sad to watch as McQueen was obviously sick and weary in certain scenes, but kept going regardless ; a true testament to his acting skills. There are plenty of actors who can't convince you of who they're supposed to be when they're perfectly well ---- for McQueen to become as real in his role as he is here under the physical condition he was in at the time is nothing short of remarkable and outstanding. It's unfortunate that 'The Hunter' was Steve McQueen's final movie, but it was a fantastic note to go out on.",N/A

642728,"I used to watch Small Wonder in the 80s when it was new.  I was little and the special effects and far-out story of a robot girl were okay by me.  I liked shows that had central characters who were children around the same age as me.  About a decade later, I watched it in reruns.  I still liked it, but it looked cornier than it had before.  About another decade later, and I get to watch it on dvd.  It looks even cornier, but, I still like it.  It brings me back to childhood in the 80s.The story revolves around The Lawson family-parents and son Jamie.  The dad brings home one of his inventions from work-VICI, a robot that looks like a little girl.  She quickly becomes a member of the family.  I like the show for being harmless fun, but also for nostalgia.  I love to see the details.  For instance, the Alvin doll that Jamie has in his room is the same one I had as a kid.  My favorite episodes are The Neighbors, Brainwashed, Spielberg Jr., The Sitter, and The Burrito Story.  There are funny moments such as Vicki and Jamie dancing to a fake Michael Jackson song.  Another main character is Harriet, the nosy neighbor with a crush on Jamie.  She is always snooping around and peeking in his window.  I used to hate Harriet, I thought she was an obnoxious mean kid, but she doesn't seem that way now.  She isn't really mean, just very pushy and snoopy.  She's actually pretty funny.  Especially when she shows Vicky how to throw a tantrum.  I think she got more annoying in later seasons.  Her parents are even worse.  Edie McClurg plays Harriet's mother and I remember her best as Mrs. Poole on The Hogan Family, and also from Ferris Bueller.  The show has budget special effects, but they really aren't so bad considering when the show was made.  They didn't look so awful then.  They're funny now.Shout Factory released Punky Brewster on dvd among others, and they always do a great job of package design as well as content.  The packaging and menus are always nicely printed and colorful, unlike some studios that release dvds that look like they were printed off someone's home computer.  As for bonuses, they've included episode commentary, a fan art gallery, and original episode promos which are fun to watch.  I remember when shows were promoted like that.  It's too bad that Tiffany Brissette and Emily Schulman did not participate in the commentary.  It would have been interesting to hear the girls' perspective.  No Reggie, either.  They did get the actor who played Warren to comment on one episode which is nice.TV is so different now, and not for the better.  This kind of show just isn't made anymore.  You don't see anything like Small Wonder, Punky, Full House, Perfect Strangers, The Facts of Life, etc. anymore.  Small Wonder is not of the same quality/caliber as those shows, but at least it is safe for families to watch.  How often do we see that on tv today?  The writing is not the greatest and the acting probably wouldn't win any awards, but the show has an 80s charm about it.  Mostly for people who liked it as children.  When I was a kid, I thought of Vicky more as a Short Circuit type of robot, one that kind of came alive after a while.  Watching now, I couldn't help but think that Vicky was more like a giant doll.  She changes a little in the last episode of the season.  I can't remember later seasons, but I think she became more ""human"" in those.  Anyway, season 2 has been released exclusively through SF's site, and I am thinking about buying one.  If only SF were in charge of Growing Pains dvds.  I'm sure they would have done a great job with those.",Small Wonder: Season 1
1201168,"So sayeth The White Queen, who was experiencing time backwards, but what 'happens' in this movie is a little hit and miss.When it works, it works well, and some of the casting, especially of Depp and Hathaway, was inspired.The story is, as usual, a blend of the two books, with the added re-entrant twist that an adult Alice is returning to Wonderland/Underland. The special effects are well done, although I hated the enlarged head that Burton gave to Helena Bonham Carter's Red Queen. She is a beautiful, classically-trained actress and the absurd distortion serves only to irritate and distract.The final Joan of Arc-style battle against the Jabberwock at least lifts the movie towards the end, before shambling back into the sterile, over-stereotyped garden party.For me, it fell well short of what it should have been, despite some solid performances. If you are going to effectively rewrite/extend the Alice saga, what is the point in stopping short of REALLY rebuilding the story arc, and taking it onto another level?The four stars are for Bonham Carter, Depp and Hathaway, who all injected their otherworldly magic into a movie that was barely worthy of their talent.",N/A
1335198,"Despite an interesting opening half hour, the Brit horror-thriller ""Salvage"" is completely undermined both by its budgetary constraints and by a second half that teeters over into the absurdly laughable.Starting out as kind of a low budget ""28 Days Later"" mixed with ""The Crazies,"" the movie sets up a compelling scenario in which a bland neighborhood is suddnely taken over by gun wielding soldiers who force everyone to stay locked up in their homes while something mysterious and sinister seems to be occurring outside.  Are the soldiers the good guys or the bad guys?  For awhile we're not quite sure, and this chaotic situation manages to generate some effective tension.The main focus of the storyline falls on the character of a mother who gets separated from her estranged daugther and is willing to risk her life by venturing outdoors in order to find her. For the first 30 minutes or so we share in the character's intense confusion as she desperately tries to make some sense of the craziness that's happening around her.  But as the plot becomes bogged down in its claustrophobic indoor setting and a slew of talky revelations between the mother and her rather unappealing ""one night stand,"" the production's lack of a budget becomes more and more pronounced.Where the film really falls apart though is in its second half, which almost looks like it was made by a completely different director. The creepy slowburn of the opening is suddenly replaced by hectic and unconvincing action scenes, ridiculous plot twists and a storyline that suddenly turns into an 80's style creature feature complete with a dopey looking creature/mutant running amok.You sense that the filmmakers thought they were being clever by subverting viewer expectations with a big ""reveal"" that explains the military's presence in the neighborhood and the bloody carnage, but in this case they may have outsmarted themselves by forcing the storyline toward an all-too-predictable conclusion. Had the film stayed the course of its promising opening and been a modest but more intimate ""28 Days Later""-style thriller, it might have been a real sleeper. As it is, it just made me sleepy.",Salvage
1283570,"Deepika is just as stunning as she was in Om Shanti Om.  And I think she is not only beautiful, but also a great dancer and a terrific actress.

I would have preferred to see a handsome dude like Arjun Rampal or John Abraham acting with Deepika.The movie is beautifully photographed and performed.  You can read the story synopsis etc. from the other reviews on Amazon.  I just don't buy Saif and Deepika always breaking up and getting back together.

345904,"Read other reviews for a description of the plot and spoilers, should you want any. I just want to say a few things.If you want to see one of the sickest movies of all time, then see The Texas Chain Saw Massacre (1974). This movie was directed by Tobe Hooper (Salem's Lot 1979, The Funhouse, Poltergeist). Tobe Hooper has his own unique style in making horror films. His seem to be sick and shocking with mentally deranged people, at least in this movie and The Funhouse.There was a Texas Chain Saw Massacre remake done in 2003, but I haven't seen it and don't plan to see it.Everything about this movie is just plain sick. There are mentally deranged people all through the movie, from beginning to end. Of course, Leatherface is the biggest sicko of them all. This movie takes a while to get to the scary action, but once things pick up it's a horror nightmare. This movie has been imitated often. Also, I can't tell you how many haunted houses I've walked through every October that have an actor portraying Leatherface with a chainsaw. Leatherface always seems to show up during haunted hayrides, also.This is one of those horror movies with a rather thin plot. It just sets out to be shocking, terrifying, and unforgettable. It succeeds.This tin container 2-DVD set has a total of about 180 minutes of bonus materials, including a documentary, audio commentary, theatrical trailers, TV Spots, Radio Spots, Still Gallery, a tour of the house with Gunnar Hansen (who plays Leatherface), a blooper reel, and more.If you want to see a horror cult classic that will stick with you, then see The Texas Chain Saw Massacre.",N/A

1209195,"XXXXX""A Mexican, a Jew, and a coloured guy walk into a bar.  The bartender looks up and says, 'Get the [common vulgar word] out of here!'""The above ""joke"" is said by this movie's main character, Walt Kowalski (Clint Eastwood, who also directed and produced this movie.)This story follows Walt, a recently widowed Korean War veteran who is alienated from his family and angry at the world.  Walt's young Hmong American neighbour Thao (or ""Toad"" as Walt calls him) tries to steal Walt's prized 1972 Ford Torino (or, more specifically, a Ford Grand Torino Sport Sports Roof) on a dare from his cousin for initiation into a gang.  Walt develops a close relationship with the boy and his older sister.  The gang does something to the older sister and Walt vows revenge declaring that ""They won't stand a chance [against me].""(Hmong or Mong Americans are residents of the U.S. who are of ethnic Hmong decent.  Indigenous Hmong are specifically from the mountainous regions of Vietnam, Laos, Thailand, and Burma. The Hmong are also one of the subgroups of Miao ethnicity in Southern China.)Despite the movie's deceptive simplicity, it evolves into something complex, powerful, and even tender.For those who like lots of mindless action in their movies, this movie can become tedious.  However, those with patience will be rewarded by this movie's end.This movie marked Eastwood's return to leading actor status after four years (his previous leading role was in the movie ""Million Dollar Baby"").  The then 78-year old delivers a superb performance in what he has said is his final film as an actor.Eastwood can make ""Get off my lawn"" (while aiming an M-1 rifle) sound as menacing as Dirty Harry's ""Make my day.""  When he says, ""I'll blow a hole in your face and [then] sleep like a baby,"" he sounds as if he means it.Beware that despite some moments, Walt's toughness is more verbal than physical.This movie features a large Hmong American cast.  Even though the actor who played Thao (Bee Vang) and the actress who play his older sister (Ahney Her) had no previous acting experience, they hold their own with Eastwood and give convincing performances.(Note that Eastwood's young son, Scott, also has a small part in this movie.)The song in the movie titled ""Gran Torino"" was nominated for the Golden Globe Awards for Best Original Song.  This music was a collaborative effort of four people that included Clint Eastwood (who sings briefly during the end credits) and his oldest son, Kyle Eastwood, who wrote the music.This movie was recognized as one of the ten best films of 2008.  Eastwood's performance gained recognition winning ""Best Actor"" from the National Board of Review.  As well, this movie has grossed almost ten times more than what it cost to make.Finally, the DVD (the one released in 2009) is perfect in picture and sound quality.  It has two extras.In conclusion, this is simply a remarkable movie.  I leave you with what Walt says to a young priest, the priest who presided over his wife's funeral:""I think you're an overeducated 27-year-old virgin who likes to hold the hands of superstitious old ladies and promise them everlasting life.""(2008;  1 hr, 55 min;  wide screen, 29 scenes;  rated 'R')&lt;&lt;Stephen Pletko, London, Ontario, Canada>>XXXXX",Gran Torino

1117426,"I don't know what I was expecting with this one, but it turns out that it's quite good. It's not really a movie about teen pregnancy - that just forms the backdrop. It's more about Juno's journey through these nine months of her life, how she experiences things, how and what she learns, etc. It's not quite a romantic comedy, but it's definitely not a drama, and it's not something sappy. It's quirky, and overall it's positive and fun. Feel-good but also serious, a little odd, and interesting to watch. No boredom here.Ellen Page does a good job - a cynical, slightly strange teen. Supporting parts by J.K. Simonds, Allison Janney and Jennifer Garner are very well done, good solid perfomances. Jason Bateman's role is a little less well done, but he basically plays a guy who won't grow up, which he does well.I'd give it a good solid 8 (out of 10), and it's something I'd watch again.",Juno

1246833,"This was an entertaining movie about a young couple, in their 30's who find they are expecting a baby and set out to find a place to live and begin their family.  The acting was superb, with John Krasinski and Maya Rudolph playing the lead roles.  Allison Janney played the part of a ditsy friend down in Phoenix that was absolutely hilarious, a far cry from her sophisticated, in-control persona on The West Wing.  Another friend in Madison played by Maggie Gyllenhaal as a spacey, new-age mom also had us laughing.  The movie was one of their self discovery and getting a taste of what life might be like in a variety of different places in the U.S. and Canada.I thought their self doubts and questioning of their lives and values was a good contrast to the many funny scenes in the movie.  I also liked the wardrobe for the characters. I really had to laugh at some of the mismatched outfits Burt showed up in, kind of like you'd expect a lot of guys to dress if they didn't have a lot of input from women, and Verona didn't seem like the type to be particularly concerned about wardrobe.This was what I call a ""slice of life"" type of movie in that it explores a lot of situations and has a lot of entertaining moments but doesn't end up with a big finale or resolution.  It wasn't one of my favorite movies or anything but was very entertaining.",N/A

One thing that I have noticed, however, is that the people that trashed District 9 can't seem to spell or form coherent sentences very well.District 9 is one of the most thought provoking movies that I have seen in years.  I'm not sure what the American viewing public has degenerated into these days, but some of the comments here sadden me.  This movie examines the human condition in a very unique way.  Yes, it is very graphic and can be disturbing.  There is no nudity or sex however.  There is no pandering to audiences.  It is powerful and pulls no punches.  I have heard comparisons to Blade Runner, another favorite to many sci-fi fans.  If that type of a movie is your cup of tea, District 9 will blow you away.  It succeeds on so many levels, please give it a chance.  Despite being an action based movie, District 9 is for intelligent viewers, not Michael Bay movie lovers.

409826,"In 1972, when this series first showed on American television, I watched it with great pleasure. And just this last week, I watched it again.  Never have I seen any adaptation of a novel as faithful as this adaptation.  Pullman did a masterly job.------  The casting is for the most part perfect, but Anthony Hopkins towers head and shoulders over the others as the vibrant star who guides us through the entire saga.  ---- I do think perhaps another Natasha might have been a little more effective, but the actress certainly gives it her all, and is faced, of course with the difficulty of playing a thirteen year old girl and a grown woman later on.  I think she does quite a respectable job.  --- What so moved me however is that so many of the scenes, and so much of the dialogue is taken directly from Tolstoy's masterpiece.  ---- And for this reason, among others, Tolstoy's great love of his created characters, his great courage in probing the depths of their hearts and souls, shines through.  ----- I know of no writer except Tolstoy who writes so beautifully of both men and women, who will devote so much time to exploring the deep feelings of women, as well as men, who will treat a woman figure with the same respect that he shows for a male figure, even Napoleon.  Tolstoy's bravery in examining the ""romantic"" feelings of Pierre for Natasha, or Andrey and Nastasha for each other, or the love of Princess Marya for her husband,  all this is almost incredible.  ----- In America today, critics tend to be cynical and snide about domestic situations described in fiction, or the romantic love a man feels for a woman and vice versa.  Not so Tolstoy.  Such thoughts never entered his mind apparently.  He takes his time describing the feelings of a mother for a baby, the feelings of a young child dreaming of greatness, the feelings of a woman in love, just as he describes in detail Andrey's search for meaning, and Pierre's search for happiness and the good.  ----  And all this is radiant in this series, right along with great battle scenes that seek to capture the true chaos and horror of war.  -----The interiors are gorgeous, the ball room scenes enchanting, the whole a great and impressive work. --------  If you have never read War and Peace, if you are intimidated by the size of the book and by the long passages on war and the philosophy of history, etc. let me suggest this:  watch this series, and then go to the book, and using the series as a road map of sorts look for the various scenes that most impressed you or struck you.  Search out the characters in the series who most engaged you.  And then take what Tolstoy has to give.  ----- You will not find any jarring disconnect between the series and the novel.  The characters you love on the screen, you will find in Tolstoy's words.  And you will find in Tolstoy a profundity perhaps never rivaled by another writer; you will find a profound exploration of love that perhaps has never been equalled in a novel anywhere else. -----  I am grateful for this series, grateful to the patience and faith that went into the making of it, and grateful that we have such a marvelous set of dvds of it today.  Highly recommended.",War & Peace BBC Production  VHS
1117632,"The people who like Juno outnumber those who don't 3 to 1. I'm in the minority. At times it's cute and amusing, and the acting is good. It's a quirky story filled with quirky characters, but even with all the quirks it is neither complex nor endearing.Juno is a preternaturally intelligent, precocious, attractive 16-year-old teen who makes up her own rules. Apparently no one can control or even influence her, not her tough, gruff father, not her tough, gruff step-mother, not her school, not her best friend or her boyfriend. But before too long we discover that Juno cares too much, that her rude, tough, pushy, arrogant, disdainful, manipulative exterior is masking a real softie inside. How original is that?To mix things up a bit, in a transparent effort to make up something ""original"" about the story, Juno decides one day to have sex with her boyfriend. Keep in mind that the most endearing quality about the boyfriend is that he is a totally passive pushover and is easily manipulated by Juno. It is Juno's idea to have sex, and when Juno says she wants sex, the boyfriend, Bleeker, has little say in the matter. Appropriately enough, the seminal act, as it were, is concluded not by smoking cigarettes, but by eating Tic Tacs (one of the many quirks of the film). Of course it was unprotected sex, because as I said, Juno makes up her own rules.Juno gets pregnant and she decides to give the baby to a set of parents of her own personal choosing. Juno's father helps her with the interviews, apparently accustomed to letting his daughter have her way. Juno quickly finds the perfect couple, and she can't wait to dump the unwanted baby on them, almost as if she has found a family to take a pet dog she's had for a month and now has grown bored with. Throughout the pregnancy, Juno continues to be the rude, rule-breaking person she's always been, though here and there we see glimpses of her softer side. She mostly ignores her boyfriend, who never really was a boyfriend anyway.The rest of the story is quite boring, the end is quite silly. But the movie is too earnest to be a comedy, though I have no idea what it is being earnest about. I don't think it's necessary to say more, except that, in the end, after the baby has been given away, Juno inexplicably decides that she, at 16, is suddenly in love with Bleeker, and no one is more surprised than Bleeker himself. It seems that even though Juno prefers to make up her own rules and break everyone else's, there is, after all, one rule that she would like to believe in: the rule of happily ever after. And if that doesn't make sense after what I've described before, it's not supposed to. :-)For those of you looking for a good, earnest, quirky movie about first love, I would suggest The Sterile Cuckoo with Liza Minnelli. It's an old movie (1969) and may be hard to find. The novel by John Nichols is good, too.",Juno

119767,"I'm embarrassed to say that I had never even heard of this film musical until I encountered it on Roger Ebert's list of all-time greatest movies (I'm checking them out at the public library, and as this title suggests, I'm up to the B's as of this writing).Well, Ebert's correct as always.  This is a WONDERFUL musical, powered by the songs of Howard Dietz and Arthur Schwartz and a brilliant cast led by Fred Astaire, Cyd Charisse, Nanette Fabray, and Oscar Levant.Impeccably directed by Vincente Minnelli, the movie tells the story of the making of a Broadway show, starring a famous star on a downward trajectory in his career (played by Astaire) and an ascendant ballet dancer (played by a gorgeous Charisse in her first acting role).Outstanding numbers here include the immortal ""That's Entertainment,"" ""Louisiana Hayride,"" and ""Dancing in the Dark,"" although the scenes featuring lesser known tunes are showstoppers as well, including ""A Shine on Your Shoes"" and ""Triplets,"" both of which must truly be seen to be believed.This double-disc DVD set merits special recognition as well, as the film has been beautifully restored to do justice to Minnelli's brilliant and meticulously selected color palette, and the second disc includes fascinating features on the making of the film and highlights of Minnelli's career.I must also make mention of one of the best film commentary tracks I've ever heard, featuring Great American Songbook scholar and singer Michael Feinstein and his good buddy, the one and only Liza Minnelli, who apparently got to visit the set every day and watch her dad shoot the film back in 1952.  Liza's in an exceptionally ebullient mood here, and both commentators avow that ""The Band Wagon"" is their all-time favorite film musical.Pick up this DVD set for your family, and you'll see why.

But things go wrong: the President is shot, a nearby hotel is bombed, and finally the podium area of the summit is bombed. By replaying the final 25 minutes leading up to these events, numerous times, the filmmakers piece together the various people involved from different vantage points. It's too bad director Pete Travis and company couldn't have told a more straightforward story instead of stooping to a gimmick like this. We're lucky it just lasts 90 minutes.

1346528,"Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time  was awesome! We have all hesitated when hearing about a video game turned movie is announced, but this is an exception. As recently as standing in line for the movie, I Twittered  to the world that I wasn't all that excited about the film. My wife and I were out and about yesterday and decided to see it anyway, and we both loved it. Let me dive right into the likes and dislikes.What I liked about the movie:The ActionMoney obviously attracted Disney to this project, but there's more to it. The action portrayed in the video games made for a very interesting concept on screen. Director Mike Newell does a magnificent job with the action. The chase scenes, the Parkour (wall-jumping), the knife fights, etc. All of the above are shot incredibly well. The pacing of the movie is great; there isn't a dull moment in the film, it's always progressing. Thumbs up to Newell on this.The ActorsAt first I thought to myself, ""Jake Gyllenhaal with an English accent is just not going to work"". Well I stand corrected, and Gyllenhaal is awesome in the lead role. He's physically insane in the movie and demands the spotlight. Gemma Arterton does well in the lead female role, and the chemistry between her and Gyllenhaal is great. They have a tough love thing going that works considering Arterton's role in the film. Alfred Molina gives some amazing comic relief in the movie. Not every joke, but for the most part his role is well played. Then there is Sir Ben Kingsley. At this point in his career, his name says it all. He does well considering he is surrounded by a cast half his age. Just great casting all around in this movie.The Usually ForgottenThe scenery is grand, the sand dunes spectacular and the sets are terrific. The soundtrack is very fitting of a summer blockbuster. As were the costumes and extras. I know I'm gushing about this movie, but really, everything was well done. It has an epic feel to it, until you see the swashbuckling action, it kind of puts it back in perspective. But it has a large scale feel to it.What I didn't like about the movie:The StoryI know it's a Disney film aimed at families, but the story is a bit weak. It was too much of the same thing in different settings (albeit beautiful settings). The trailers pretty much give it away. ""The dagger is important, follow the dagger."" Problem is, and I hate when movies do this, ""he has the dagger, no she has the dagger. No wait, he has the dagger. Wait wait, now that guy over there has the dagger."" Enough!Overall, very satisfied and would be willing to see it again if someone were to ask me. Be weary that it is aimed at kids and families and then you wont be disappointed. The action, the direction, acting and set pieces are all worth your 12 bucks. After you see it, let me know what you think.",Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time 2010 Gemma Arterton
1329493,"Among other things, A History of Christianity: The First Three Thousand Years shows that seeds planted in youth flower in adulthood. This six-part series, co-produced by the BBC, the Open University and Jerusalem Productions, is hosted and narrated by Diarmaid MacCulloch, Professor of the History of the Church at the University of Oxford and a Fellow of St. John Cross College in Oxford.When MacCulloch's father, an Anglican minister, and his mother took their young son Diarmaid on their explorations of historic churches, they probably never realized they were sowing the seeds of his future. Diarmaid became fascinated with church history and so began his life work, of which this series is a part.Now, instead of his parents leading the way, it is MacCulloch taking viewers through ancient structures and landmarks around the world. Ever the explorer, he searches for meaning in places that hold clues to the past, interviewing local experts and people who provide a diversity of thought.MacCulloch is not only a well-respected historian, but an excellent narrator and a likeable guide. He unashamedly professes his fondness for the Anglican faith, he being the last of three generations of Anglican clergy. If he has a bias, it may be against the western form of Christianity as practiced by the Roman Catholic Church. He seems more charitable toward the eastern wing, exhibited in the Orthodox Church. The good news is that over the course of the six episodes shown below, he gives equal coverage to each of the major branches of the church.1. The First Christianity2. Catholicism: The Unpredictable Rise of Rome3. Orthodoxy: From Empire to Empire4. Reformation: The Individual Before God5. Protestantism: The Evangelical Explosion6. God in the DockOne of the highlights is that MacCulloch tells more than just the same old story. He is not afraid to correct conventional wisdom and to bring out what might be overlooked. For example, he believes that Christianity stayed closer to its Middle-Eastern roots than many people realize. To illustrate that point, rather than initially tracing the spread of the faith to Rome, he takes the eastern road, which goes from Jerusalem to Asia, including parts of China.In another segment, he takes us to Skellig Michael, a place that might be overlooked by many historians, but significant because this remote island was a center for the monastic life of Irish Christian monks for 600 years. Equally interesting is his account of Russian history and orthodoxy.Filmed in HD, everything about the production is first-rate. This is no surprise given that the series is licensed by the BBC.For all its merits, it falters somewhat in the last episode. Calling himself a ""candid friend"" rather than a Christian, MacCulloch asserts that the church failed to resist the Nazis. He reasons that since the Jews were considered killers of Christ and enemies of the church, the church is ""implicated in the murder of Jews.""It gets even more controversial in his interview with Rev. Nicholas Holtam of St. Martin Church-in-the-Fields, London. MacCulloch believes that questions about gender and sexuality present significant challenges to the church. He identifies himself as a gay man, and in response to an inquiry from MacCulloch, Rev. Holtam states, ""The Scriptures don't say anything about faithful, same-sex relationships and therefore, what's condemned in Scripture isn't what we are dealing with now.... I think the Bible's answer is that what matters between human beings is loving, faithful, honest relationships.""It should be noted that MacCulloch does not accept the authority of the Scriptures. He alludes to being unconvinced that the Bible is different from all other books.Throughout the series, MacCulloch continually emphasizes that the Church has survived by its ability to adapt. He may wonder if the Church will successfully adjust to changing gender and sexual norms. Conservative Christians must be prepared to discuss these concluding ideas if they want to use this in a group setting. Unfortunately, this last segment detracts from the overall excellence of the series. Even so, this production provides a thought-provoking overview of Church history, and I give MacCulloch credit for telling it like he sees it.",N/A

1328350,"EASY AThis film turned out to be much better than I had expected to be honest, I knew it would be good but it was better than I thought. Still to be honest I was not really looking to see this that bad, until my girl got it and had me watch it with her. Of course it was along the lines of these new John Hughes style flicks but it was good. I don't think it turned out as classic as Hughes's films but it was a nice homage to the man's movies.Olive [Emma Stone] is your typical teenager in high school just looking to fit in even though she is an obvious individual with a personality. Still she tries to fit in any way especially with her best friend who she ends up lying to about not only a date but loosing her virginity. Like most news that is passed around in high school it all starts in the bathroom, and the wrong person hears it. Almost immediately the rumors start and she now has a reputation, although not the best one she is now noticed.Of course now she is getting all kinds of offers and she even kinda takes them, kinda. She takes payment for her services but she only agrees to say she does stuff with people to help their rep. Of course her legend only grows as does her problems and her feelings about everything. She must deal with what people think of her, some religious students, and of course her best friend who is turning on her. Oh and did I mention the guy she actually likes, makes for an interesting time.Written by Bert V. Royal and directed by Will Gluck this film manages to rise above being just another average film. The direction is nice and the script is excellent as it plays on not only John Hughes films but also on the book ""Scarlet Latter"". Of course if you know that story that explains the A part of the title of the film more s than her just being at school, I am sure you know what I mean.Emma stone is excellent here as she has been in everything I have seen her in thus far; this may be her best performance yet. Every one including Thomas Haden Church and Lisa Kudrow but it was real nice to see Amanda Bynes in this. I will admit right now I am a fan of hers mainly because I loved a show back in the day called ""All That"". She did a great job as the arch enemy of Emma here with the whole overly religious thing. Of course the film makers had her play that stereo typical over the top religious person but it was good.This film ended up being pretty good but as it went it started to slip a little bit, but not enough to hurt it. Over all I would say it is worth a rental at least especially if you are into this type of film. A fun cast mixed with a great script made for a good film, well worth the time. Also Emma Stone impressed me with this film, I liked more in this then I did in ""Zombieland"" which was another film I liked.",N/A
296515,"Andrei Tarkovsky's cinematic interpretation of the science fiction novel ""Solaris"" by Stanislaw Lem is among a handful of films made in the late 1960s and 1970s that seem to define that period as one of existential science fiction, somewhere in between the youth-oriented Cold War paranoia invasion flicks of the post-War era and special effects and heart-thumping adventure of the ""Star Wars"" franchise. But ""Solaris"" was made in the Soviet Union, based on a Polish novel, and starred a Lithuanian actor in the lead role and an Estonian in a supporting role. Anxieties in the Eastern bloc must not have been so different than in the West in 1972.The ""action"" of ""Solaris"" is largely internal, but the story is that of Kris Kelvin (Donatas Banionis), a psychologist and astronaut who visits a space station orbiting the planet Solaris. Reports from the station have been unintelligible, and authorities on Earth want to know whether they should take it out of orbit or continue to research Solaris' Ocean, which is believed by some to have a consciousness. Kris finds two remaining scientists on the station, Drs. Snaut (Juri Jarvet) and Sartorius (Anatoli Solonitsyn), who have very different views of what they should do about the phenomena they have encountered. And Kris finds his wife Hari (Natalya Bondarhchuk) there, ten years after she died.""Solaris"" takes its time. We don't even leave Earth for 45 minutes, and the film runs 2 hours 50 minutes. The pace seems intended to lull its audience into the world of the film -and perhaps into a contemplative mood as well. It works. In the end, ""Solaris"" didn't seem too long. The humans of ""Solaris"" are of two world views or two personalities: Snaut, who believes that we must consider moral insight as well as objective knowledge, dreams of communication with Solaris' Ocean. Sartorius, who sees no need to look farther than what can be observed or tested, thinks the Ocean is nothing but trouble. ""We don't need other worlds. We need a mirror...We are in the foolish human predicament of striving for a goal that he fears,"" says Snaut.It seems that Solaris has provided mirrors, but no one really wants one. The scientists' bewilderment and primitive attempts at communication with the Ocean could represent human's inability to understand ourselves, each other, or, indeed, other species. I assume all three. In any case, ""Solaris"" is a beautiful and thoughtful film. Cinematographer Vadim Yusov knows how to take in a landscape so as to draw attention to its parts rather than the whole. And the silver and red tubular corridors of the space station, strewn with stuff somebody dropped while distracted by more pressing matters, becomes a space of its own. ""Solaris"" is heavy-handed in its existentialism but sometimes subtle in its meaning. I found it thoroughly enjoyable.

According to my understanding, the Wendigo is Sasquatch only uglier and meaner. Some Native tribes say it is a spirit...I guess the ghost of a bigger, meaner Bigfoot. The Chinoo, which in this film is also named as a possible culprit for the evil goings-on, may be a pathetic attempt at citing the Chinook Tribe (unless that is what the film meant to do, I can't actually tell). I know the ""Chinooks"" as a wind blowing down from the Rockies in Colorado, it usually blows away all traces of the first snow each year.Apparently the lesson here is the earth will fight back if you desecrate it. Well, this is your standard B-flick and it royally sucks. The dialogue is hilariously bad and the camera work is LSD-influenced as usual. It isn't even a good global warming message, it simply spooks one minute and grosses us out the next minute.Of course, I was taken with the character of Maxwell, played by the sexy Zach Gilford (DARE); I was mesmerized by his incredible body, which was also obviously loved by the camera. Gilford's hometown is not far from mine. It angered me that he was the first to go nuts and die. It's his corpse we see on the DVD cover art.

1030172,"It seems that few of the people who have reviewed this film (on various sites) make note of the incredible contrast between what this man, George Muller, lived and witnessed the evidence of compared to what is preached and practiced in today's churches and Christian ministries.  Muller believed that anything which God has blessed and called into existence, He will also provide for - especially financially!  Muller never asked for money, never requested donations, never sent out mailers/newsletters identifying a need, never started a fund-raising campaign, never manipulated anyone to give money by sharing his own circumstances!  He chose, along with his wife, to trust only God and make their needs known only to Him.  As a result, every single one of their needs were met... often with abundance!Over the course of his life, Muller gave away over $400,000 of his own money and supported thousands of orphans (feeding them, housing them, educating them, teaching them the Gospel, and equipping them with a trade so they could achieve in life) and he traveled to city after city (over 200,000 miles throughout the course of his ministry) sharing the Gospel, giving away tens of thousands of Bibles, sharing his life and working for the good of others - all without asking for a cent!  Muller proved with his life, year after year, that God is well able to support His work.  What an amazing testimony!  This movie does a great job of introducing us to the man in a well organized documentary with dramatic sequences throughout.  It will make you want to read up and discover more about his life and the love for God that inspired him in everything!  Religious organizations (i.e. their leadership) sometimes found it hard to align themselves with his concept of faith, because it left them without tangible controls.  It required absolute faith in God and full sincerity of heart.  Muller stuck to his convictions and didn't get dragged down by potential conflicts.  He just happily went along trusting God.  Many people were drawn to him, no doubt because the light of God's love that shone so brightly through him.And what does this mean for many so-called ministries today?  Muller's life gives all of us something fantastic to consider.  Many believe themselves called to ""ministry"" yet they also often tangle themselves up with finances and get caught in the rut of begging for money to keep their so-called God-inspired organizations running...  They approach ""ministry"" as though it were some ""thing"" rather than what it truly is (biblically); loving and sacrificial service!  True ministry requires no money at all - only faith working through love in willing individuals who have been touched by God!  Where is the genuineness of faith in God who will supply all our needs according to His riches in glory and who is well able to support any work He calls into existence?  Perhaps it's no wonder we see so few miracles in our day...  for no one (or at least few) seems to trust God anymore;  If there is not money to finance a work, then we think such work is impossible - rather than stopping to even ask God for His blessing and trusting Him to provide if indeed He is the one who called it to be.  What if there was more of this kind of reliance upon God?  I'll just bet you we would see the same kind of incredible miracles that Muller (and others like him) experienced in his own life, not to mention the joy this man carried in his heart his entire life, even though he had his seasons of suffering.  He always had a smile on his face and to this day his work is a testimony to the faithfulness and love of God.Great movie/documentary/drama!  Highly recommended!",Robber of the Cruel Streets

1347247,"I received my Blu-ray copy of this film while I was entertaining house guests. Being the selfish sort that I am, I insisted on watching it and not waiting days until my guests left. The female of the pair had barely heard of Rush, and was certainly not a fan. She even joked that it is ""a guy's band"". She watched the entire film, and said that she really enjoyed it!I can't add much that has not already been said in other reviews, but this is a film for fans of musicians, entertainers, and underdogs in general. Obviously it's all about Rush, but the story at the core is that three very talented musicians were able to achieve great success while maintaining their integrity (not just an illusion here) and creative freedom.The most enjoyable portions of the documentary for me are the exchanges between the band members, often very candid. It is clear that these men are close friends and care very much for one another - even beyond their bond within the band. I truly believe that they put their friendship above the success of the band.The Blu-ray and DVD contain about 1 1/2 hours of extra footage, some of which is priceless. My personal favorite are the scenes filmed while Geddy, Alex, and Neil have a casual dinner together in a hunting lodge.

1264047,"Take a story about the failing newspaper industry and the government's use of private security firms here and abroad (forgetting to include any big moments of action or intense drama), and add in a cast of great stars and character actors doing mediocre performances, and you get ""State of Play"". I enjoy thrillers and based on the cast, I expected a lot more in this movie. There were a couple of plot twists that kept it from being completely predictable and perhaps one or two thrilling scenes, but that was it. This is a movie which doesn't succeed in saying much and doesn't make you feel much at all. I never saw the BBC series it was based on, so I cannot make comparisons. There were times it felt like the movie itself was a TV show of only so-so quality; the original might've been much better.Russell Crowe plays Cal McAffrey, an old school reporter working at the Washington Globe, a newspaper recently bought by a new media conglomerate and fighting to stay afloat. Rachel McAdams is Della Frye, the upstart blogger working at the paper who begins with very different ideas on reporting. A story starts to unfold where Congressman Stephen Collins (Ben Affleck) is at the center of a standard political scandal. He's on a panel investigating PointCorp, a private firm hired by the government for security overseas and at home, when Sonia, a researcher on the case whom he was having an affair with, is killed. McAffrey forms a theory about a conspiracy and partners with Frye to investigate. To complicate matters, Collins is an old friend of McAffrey, and in the past McAffrey had an affair with Collins's wife.Thus the standard plot of an evil security firm doing anything to make money is laid out, along with a politician having an affair. Several times the movie demonstrates how newspapers are being pushed aside in favor of online news; however, it never seems to make a strong case for print media. The only case made is that reporters regardless of their media need to follow leads and be diligent in researching. I couldn't help but think when they were submitting a story to be printed that many people probably would've already read the news online by then or seen it on TV.Part of my problem with the movie is that it never made me care strongly about any of the characters. Crowe is a wonderful actor but he showed little emotion here. Helen Mirren demonstrated more emotion as the newspaper editor, but the only emotion seemed to be anger. Despite what his character was going through, Affleck didn't seem to show much emotion outside of one scene.The movie started with a cookie cutter plot and aside from a couple of plot twists did little to grab my attention. There was nothing special about the action sequences (few that there were) or the cinematography. And whether it was the acting, the script, or the directing, none of the characters really stood out or elicited much emotion.",N/A

1047455,"I'm not here to launch detailed film review as I normally do... and I definitely won't endeavor to point out the nonstop political incorrectness of this crazy film. I just chiefly wanted to convey that this is the most hilarious, side-splitting film I've ever seen in my half-Century (+) on the planet.THE STORY: Borat is a television commentator in Kazakhstan and he comes to America with his producer on a shoestring budget to document life here. He starts out in New York City but he quickly decides to head for California where his true Hollywood love is involved in the television industry (Baywatch). He encounters BIG TROUBLE (based upon his crude cultural background) everywhere he goes. It's that simple.My brother and I watched this movie yesterday and both of us laughed so hard from beginning to end that we had to watch the movie a second time to hear all the stuff we failed to attend during the first round from laughing too loudly. Neither of us is a contemporary film fan (both of us are retired cops) but we avow to make a big exception here. We had tears in our eyes and could barely catch our breath -- it's that funny.Is this 2006 film for everyone? Well no, the kiddies will have to be nudged out of the room (and out of earshot as well) and I assume that there are women, minorities, devout Christians, and other folks who are particularly sensitive to ethnic remarks and incendiary language who will abhor this one. I'd say that most people will come down on this movie firmly on one side or the other, with few on the fence.So, there's some pretty provocative nudity and the language is akin to what you might expect to hear from an angry and drunken Portuguese Stevedore. Heck, the antics themselves are pretty provocative. But in the end, if you don't care about all that stuff, it's just a movie, folks -- if you think that this presentation would offend you, just don't watch it.All others RUN... don't walk, RUN to the video store and rent or buy this crazy film!

1173994,"The Young Victoria is a magnificent historical drama depicting the childhood and early reign of Queen Victoria.  Victoria was a lonely child brought up by her widowed mother, cloistered in an out of the way corner of Kensington Palace.  She knew no one of her own age and grew up in an atmosphere of fear and intrigue.  Her mother, the Duchess of Kent, worried that her daughter might die young or be murdered (a not all together groundless fear since her uncles, whom she preceded in the Line of Succession, were greedy and callous), and kept her under constant guard.  The Duchess was under the control of her unscrupulous comptroller Sir John Conroy, who saw  himself as the future power behind a throne occupied by an intimidated Victoria.Despite the dysfunctional nature of her upbringing, Victoria grew into an intelligent and independent minded young woman who, when she succeeded to the throne at 18, immediately rid herself of her mother and Sir John Conroy's influence.  It was at this time that Victoria came under the spell of two very different men, her first Prime Minister Lord Melbourne and her first cousin and future husband Prince Albert of Saxe-Coburg-Gotha.  A marriage between the two had been planned almost from their births by the ambitious Saxe-Coburg family, and it was fortunate that on Victoria's side at least the marriage was also a love match. Soon after his wedding Albert began taking steps to assert himself, and eventually ended up serving as an unacknowledged but indispensable co-monarch with his wife.This is the bare bones summary of the very rich and complex story of The Young Victoria.  Beautifully filmed with elegant sets and costumes, it also does an excellent job of depicting the complicated political situation of the late 1830s, when the British monarch was still able to influence public policy.  Emily Blunt and Rupert Friend are marvelous in the chief roles, and the supporting roles are ably filled as well.  Anyone who has read much about Victoria's early reign will recognize that some historical liberties have been taken in the name of drama, but the essential story is accurate.This marvelous film will be added to my DVD collection as soon as it is released, and I anticipate many happy hours watching it for many years to come.",N/A

In fact, it looks like they saved the best for last.With a bunch of reviews already here, there is no sense going into the story. For those who haven't seen it yet, three surprises stood out for me: (1) the high number of new characters introduced; (2) the darkness of some of them; this is not always a fun story; (3) the incredibly-touching last 15-or-so minutes.Also, the artwork is at the usual high standard, especially some scenes in the last half hour at the dump yard, of all places.

341009,"The 1975 UFO-abduction of Travis Walton near Snowflafe Arizona is probably the most convincing such case on record. It was multiply witnessed; Travis (the abductee) was missing for five days and nights to be returned traumatised and dehydrated; extensive investigation including polygraph testing of all the witnesses only strengthened the reality of the case, and not one of the witnesses has changed a single detail of his testimony after 35 years. Anomalies in tree growth compatible with high radiation exposure have been identified in subsequent years in the precise location where the encounter with the UFO reportedly took place, so despite being outside our normal paradigms of consensus reality, it looks like it really happened.Tracy Torme's 1993 film is a thoughtful piece of work which conveys the essential elements of the story and is largely faithful to the real-life narrative. D. B. Sweeney as Travis and Robert Patrick as Mike Rogers are particularly outstanding in an excellent cast. All the cast and crew became convinced by the story during the shoot. A town in Oregon substituted for Snowflake in the film.The film begins on the morning of 5 November 1975, a normal day for the young loggers engaged in their tree-thinning contract. The encounter takes place as the seven loggers make their journey home down a mountain road in Mike Rogers' pick-up truck in the early evening, shown from the perspective of the six witnesses as Travis is knocked off his feet by a beam from the hovering UFO. The subsequent difficulties experienced by members of the crew during the five days Travis was missing is well realised, as they deal with accusations and incredulity from the wider community and suspicion from the local police authorities. Then Travis is returned, confused and traumatised, the story attracts the international media and things get even worse for all involved. The film has a good script, dramatic tension, is convincingly acted, well edited and rewards occasional repeat viewings.In his literary and informative book of the same name, Travis describes the making of the film and his involvement with it. He explains the reasons why the abduction scene aboard the UFO and the appearance of the aliens in the film differ from his real-life recollection; why these changes were made to enhance the drama and to communicate the horror and strangeness to the audience. He also felt D.B. Sweeney was well cast, shared his attitude to life and had a similar general character, and was pleased with his portrayal in the film. I really recommend reading the book to anyone interested in the story. Travis is a good writer and discusses many things including his own life prior to the abduction and some of the far-reaching philosophical implications of non-human extraterrestrial life, particularly as it seems to be visiting us here.I met Travis in Snowflake AZ in May 2010 and found him to be as genuine, straightforward and principled as everyone who meets him describes him to be. He wishes he'd stayed in the truck with the others, and would have preferred had the incident happened to somebody else. The international exposure has been so unwelcome that for years he didn't even have a phone and shunned virtually all media contact. He and Dana (who have been happily married all these years) have four children and eight grandchildren, and almost never discuss the incident within the family or with neighbors.

1141580,"The Grand is a mockumentary that lacks Chris Guest's magic touch, but does have its moments. It's a lampoon of an easy target: poker and the selling of it and the WSOP on tv. The subject needs little tinkering to be funny/ stupid: the real shows are such hymns to greed and selfishness that one need add little.The highlights here are a few of the actors, specifically Chris Parnell as the internet poker geek, Herzog as The German (playing into type, perhaps), McKean as Steve Lavisch (clearly based on Steve Wynn), and a few of the others at moments. Woody is good enough as a Ted Binion-type, and David Cross is a humorous cross between Howard Lederer and Phil Hellmuth (now there's an unholy union), with Cheryl Hines as his Annie Duke-ish sister. Any poker fan will recognize the references, but will probably also wonder why this isn't quite as funny as it should have been.Director Penn has his concept right but never delivers in full; there are laughs but many are forced. My favorite line is Cross' ""Is that Rush?"", and one guesses it was an improv, like much of this. But where Guest has an ensemble that can ad lib with genius, only Cross and McKean can do it at that level here. And seeing as McKean is in all of Guest's movies, I'd recommend all of those before this.Nonetheless, if you've played cards much or watched the WSOP on the tube, you're bound to enjoy some of The Grand. But if you're not a poker fan, there will be precious little for you here. Not to worry; you'll see many worse rivers than that as life plays out.",The Grand

Don't get me wrong, I didn't expect it to look like a new release but it is not all that different from the DVD version I used to own. On the plus side I no longer have to change the disc to see the whole movie.

1325549,"I am always on the lookout for a movie that has good clean fun for the whole family.  We look for movies that the little people in our family can enjoy as well as the big people.  When I revieiwed Old Dogs, I had concept in mind as the jacket clearly states - ""Fun for the Whole Family.""Synopsis:  Dan (Robin Williams) and his best friend and business partner Charlie (John Travolta) are on the verge of the biggest deal in the history of their sports marketing firm when their lives are turned upside down by a surprise visit from Dan's ex-wife Vicki (Kelly Preston). Vicki has big news for Dan--their ever-so-brief liaison produced twins Zach (Conner Rayburn) and Emily (Ella Bleu Travolta), now seven-years-old and in need of a dad to keep an eye on them for two weeks. With only high-living playboy Charlie for support, Dan's bumbling attempts at ""on the job training"" in fatherhood result in a series of disastrously funny exploits that lead him to a new understanding of what really matters in life. Featuring an extraordinary cast of comedy purebreds including Seth Green, Matt Dillon and Lori Loughlin, Old Dogs will have audiences rolling over and begging for more.My Opinion:  This movie was hilarious and almost too much at times. This would not have been my favorite kind of movie as the comedy bordered on just plain dumb at times.  However, the last time I said that about a movie, my brother thought it was great.  My husband who also viewed it with me found that the majority of the humor was over the top but towards the end, he was glued and dying of laughter.  The movie has a sweet story of a father getting to know his children for the first time and the sacrifices he must make to get to know them.There were times when the humor was not appropriate for young children and they might question what the actors were talking about.  Overall my husband and I would give this movie a B rating.  He would probably watch again but I don't know as I would have my two year old watch it.",N/A
714277,"As a horror fan, I have been on a mission here lately to locate never before seen or obscure horror films that have slipped by me and have been next to impossible to find in any store here and are never shown on TV. The first was ""The House On Sorority Row"", which I got and wrote a review for. The next on my list was this film, ""The Prowler"", from 1981. Yes, 1981. The year most horror/slasher fans say was the pinnacle year for this subgenre of horror. I've heard many a slasher fan herald this film as one of the best, and I have heard many a horror fan say...well, not so much. I had always been curious about this little seen cult classic, and I finally tracked down and ordered a copy. My verdict?. Well, first thing's first....The movie opens with a great news reel showing troops returning home on boat from World War II. A nice and interesting opening. We begin in Avalon Bay, 1945. The night of the graduation dance. A female has just written to her war hero boyfriend a ""Dear John"" letter. A mysterious figure makes his presence known in brutally grotesque fashion in the opening minutes. Who is this guy?. Somebody gone crazy after the war?. The recipient of the 'Dear John' letter?. We flash forward 35 years to 1980, where the town is once again deciding to celebrate with a party, which had been banned ever since the horrible murders. We are introduced to a number of college co-eds and their boyfriends, a sheriff, a deputy, a town weirdo, and so on. And red herrings. Needless to say, someone is definitley not happy that the town has decided to throw a party again, and the body count begins to rise....""The Prowler"" was released the same year as ""My Bloody Valentine"", and both are similar in ways. Both had something tragic happen during a town event/dance, only for it to be banned. Cut to years later and the dance is resurrected and the killer returns to bump off people. This movie was directed by Joseph Zito, who would go on to bigger attention(and box office) with ""Friday The 13th IV : The Final Chapter"", which many consider to be the best sequel or just the best F13 film. You can see Zito putting to use here what he did in F134, only the latter was better. Zito does set some good tone and atmosphere here and there, and there are some great lighting and angle shots. Best of all, he lingers pretty well on all the violence and lets the red stuff flow and spurt and let's everyone see it in all it's glory. Of course, the praise for that goes to Tom Savini, another F13 vet, who would re-team with Zito on Part 4. The movie has had a reputation for being among Savini's best and most brutal work. I have to say that that part of the movie does not disappoint at all, especially a rather nasty death sequence in a pool. The best of the bunch. Elsewhere, Savini lets rip with multiple stabbings with long knives and, kind of bizarrely, a pitchfork. It works for me, but does seem kind of out of place. Savini showcases some of his best work here, but he has done just as good stuff in other films too. If that's what you are looking for, you shouldn't be disappointed. Despite some good work from Zito and great work from Savini, it's not enough to save the movie.So, Zito does some nice direction, and Savini delivers the goods. But does that make the movie?. It will surely satisfy the gorehounds, but the movie itself ends up being a disappointment. It's fun and entertaining in spots, and I like the opening minutes including the 1945 scenario and our introduction to the town and all that. Sadly, not too long after that the movie then slows down, and I came away from it feeling a bit underwhelmed. During the course of the film, our two main heroes decide to check out old, dark, creepy houses and dark cemeteries, trying to find out what's going on here. It certainly looks good and like it belongs in a horror movie, but there's little payoff to most of it. Just a lot of slowness with these two creeping around. Come to think of it, I think these two do more, ahem, ""prowling"", than the Prowler himself. The movie was really building to some momentum and more fun, but then it just immediatley comes to a halt with this detective stuff and some quick shots of the killer's boots. It lost some steam when it should of just been getting it. Also, the movie wasted some opportunities with other characters who one would assume were set up to be Prowler fodder. Unfortunatley, they go off and the viewer thinks ""Alright!. Here it comes!"" and then nothing. We don't see them again. Not only was it a letdown, but afterwards you wonder why they even bothered showing them in the first place in what felt like a set up for some red stuff and then just go off and leave them?. It was a bit odd and a waste of what could of shown more Savini magic. But hey, who ever said these movies usually make a lot of sense?. The Prowler himself is pretty creepy looking, all decked out in GI gear, but that doesn't extend to the characterization of the character. Needless to say, he's no Michael Meyers or Freddy Krueger.All in all, ""The Prowler"" is a mixed bag. It delivers the gore and the setting and atmosphere is quite nice, and Zito does get some nice shots and spooks, but it's all rolled up with a lot of time that slows the movie down quite a bit(I even nodded off once and that should never happen for me during a slasher movie!), odd scenes that don't have any satisfying conclusion, and a final reveal of the killer who may surprise some. The killer's identity was another problem. I don't recall there being any reason. Why was this person doing it?. Did I miss something?. Was this the guy that got the letter in the beginning or was he just some crazy kook?. Nothing was ever really explained. It was handled oddly, but the death scene was one of the most memorable. Acting-wise, some is passable, but mostly it's just average on most parts, and below average on others. Basically, your typical b-movie slasher performances. Hollywood veterans Farley Granger and Lawrence Tierney appear in this movie. Granger gets more screen time, while Tierney is in two scenes and has no dialogue and then just disappears. Another odd thing about the movie.So, ""The Prowler"" delivers in some areas, but it's by no means one of the best of the early 80s slashers. I like these kinds of movies, but even I came away disappointed. For myself, it didn't turn out to be one of the shining lights of the early slasher boom as others think it is. It's mildly entertaining, and easily watchable, but most of the praise goes to Savini and his great, bloody work. Like I said earlier, the set-up is similar to ""My Bloody Valentine"". The difference being that that movie was much, much better.",N/A
664683,"I am very happy with this DVD. You get to have two routines to follow as you progress and lots of explanations. All the basics are covered. It's easy to take your cue from Michelle Dozois, she's got great educational skills. My level was a beginner's level who only followed several lessons once a week during 3 months with a great Pilates teacher. She showed me how to hold on to the right pilates posture, she was quite focus on the posture because it's a key element to do pilates efficiently. Then I moved away and went to a diffent gym center. The pilates courses were dreadfull and that's why I bought this DVD. Michelle is definitely an inspiring teacher and I would recommand this DVD to anyone, even true beginners who never tried sport before. Some top fitness teachers should closely watch how the ""for dummies"" collection is built, in regards with the menu, the informations and the instructions you get. It's safe and enjoyable with no delay. It's surprising how some workouts are filmed like music videos. In this video the focus is on the exercice core, not on the teacher's face or the decor.

287612,".....The picture got better when pressure was put upon the Queen to send her Latin lover home and to marry a Swede who would give her an heir to the throne.  Garbo turned in some fine acting as she agonized over her final decision to abdicate and to leave with her lover......The movie is interesting to movie buffs because Garbo and Gilbert had been real life lovers.  They met on the set of Flesh and the Devil when Gilbert was a Silent Film star and Garbo an unknown newcomer.  They lived together for three years but Gilbert wanted marriage and children and Garbo just wanted them to live together.  Finally when she refused his final marriage proposal, Gilbert broke off the relationship and married another actress......When sound movies became popular some actors like Gilbert had their careers destroyed while others like Garbo were instant hits and became mega stars.  Louis B. Mayer, the head of MGM had originally signed Lawrence Olivier to play the part of Antonio in Queen Christiana but Garbo, in an attempt to help Gilbert's sagging career, told Mayer that she would make the movie with Gilbert and nobody else.  Mayer, who hated Gilbert and had vowed to destroy his career, gave in to Garbo's demands and cast them together for the last time.  Two years later Gilbert was dead at the age of 36......Garbo led a twisted and tormented life and was most likely AC/DC but she probably loved Gilbert as much as she was capable of loving any man and he came the closest to getting her to the altar.",Queen Christina VHS

965217,"Harry Potter has known for years that Lord Voldemort wants to destroy him, but in this episode the knowledge comes home in a very personal way.  When Hogwarts is chosen as the site of the Triwizard Tournament and hosts teams from two other wizard schools, students under the age of 17 are specifically forbidden from entering their names in the competition--but somehow Harry's name ends up in the running, and what's more he's accepted.  This causes considerable tension and partisanship among Hogwarts students and leads to a serious break between Harry and his buddy Ron Weasley (Rupert Grint), which is only worsened by their realization that Hermione (Emma Thompson) isn't just a grindy girl any longer.  That, in turn, leads to trouble with fellow competitor and Qudditch star Viktor Krum (Stanilav Ianevski), and to a triangle involving Harry, Cho Chang (Katie Leung), and competitor Fleur Delacour (Clemence Poesy).  In the end Harry learns just how--and by whom--the draw was rigged and must face Voldemort on a more dangerous footing than ever before.Given the length of the original book, a good deal unfortunately gets left out of the movie.  One of the high points, for example, is the Quiddith World Cup sequence, which is far too short (the impression I got is that the games are never even finished before Voldemort's Death Eaters put in an appearance).  Meanwhile a new Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher, the former Auror ""Mad-Eye"" Moody (brendan Gleeson), arrives at Hogwarts, and two former prisoners at Azkaban, Igor Karkaroff (Pedja Bjelac) and Barty Crouch, Jr. (David Tennant), play vital parts.  Harry also discovers how unpleasant publicity can be when Rita Skeeter (Miranda Richardson), the aptly-named (she's both pestiferous and persistent) Daily Prophet reporter who has come to Hogwarts to cover the ""human-interest"" aspect of the games, turns out to be a gossipmonger and a distorter of everything that's said to her.  This is also the literal midpoint of the series and the place where it begins to turn much darker and scarier, foreshadowing the tests and trials still to come.  As has been pointed out before, kids who started reading the Potter books or watching the films when they first appeared should be old enough to handle everything, but the youngest ones, who don't have the advantage of growing into Harry's adventures along with him, may need a year or two before they can do as well.",N/A
1247279,"The public mistrust in the obscure working of the government is brought alive in ""The Crazies"".  An Ebola-like outbreak erupted in a small rural town which resulted in transforming the infected persons into a vicious belligerent killers.  The rumors quickly spread that hunters located  a sunken airplane where the source of the infection seems to have spread. The signs of the disease spread quickly, got the attention of the local Sheriff with the sudden increase in criminal activities of unexpected transformation of individuals.On the other side of society, the government had already determined to exterminate the whole infected population in order to spare the rest from the spread of the deadly virus. Unbeknown to the local Sheriff, who was occupied by deciphering the local crimes, the National Guard was dispatched to seal the town, quarantine the infected population, and destroy all moving escapees. Within the quarantined population, the infected ones turned against the living individuals and reeked havoc, death, and terror within the isolated and sealed zone.The vast might of the state enabled it to track all moving escapees by airborne robotics and tightly control the spread of individuals. The whole town must die, either from the leaked deadly virus or the inflicted victims whose belligerence was caused by the infection.The movie embodies the fears of many people of the uncontrolled and poorly scrutinized government biological research. As some who believe that AIDS was an experimental virus that was designed to eradicate homosexuals and blacks, the movie displays the struggle between the mighty and the almighty.  The Sheriff of the town, whose wife was a doctor, was the last to know about his government's plot to exterminate his own town, including him and his family.The First Amendment of the Constitution that secures the peoples' right to carry arms was defeated by the overwhelming might of the state compared to the small, isolated fire arms that lacks the organization and vast resources of the state. Or, one might wish to believe that the escape of the Sheriff and his wife was made possible by their access to fire arms.Like many science fiction movies that succeeded in predicting the future course of society, The Crazies contributes to the pools of thoughts on that trend. It was bloody, frightening, and gloomy, from start to end.  In the real word, the Anthrax deliberate leak from the governmental laboratories followed the same train of thoughts of this movie, despite of being an isolated act of a deranged man.",N/A

Just looked back at the product page and there IS A DUB ON THIS! In case you were foolishly assuming that Amazon posted correct information. heh. I'll warn people who haven't watched the show- the first season is good, with a nice amount of plot and of course some complimetary fanservice. The second season however epic it may be, is  without coherent plot. There is a plot, but it does involve them throwing galaxies at the bad guy. Also, the fanservice gets a little out of hand with Yokos' outfit... But for the price I paid, it was definitely worth it.

It doesn't have the individual dvd cases, but that saves a lot of room on your shelf and keeps the price low. Also, I'd classify this for young adults/teens. Probably not something to get for a real young-un if only because they won't appreciate it.

997364,"The second year of this series was a step in the right direction in some ways. But in others...Animation wise, its still as great as the first season but one thing I forgot to mention last time. The sky in Gotham is on some kind of drug because its not the same color for two consecutive episodes, let alone within one. First its green, then purple, then red. I know in the fourth volume of Batman: TAS, the sky was red but it at least remained one consistent color. And when a character or building is set against the sky, it looks rather bland since there no clouds, reminding me of how cheap the third season of the Adam West series had been (cardboard cutouts in front of a stark black backdrop). But when there's a storm going on, the sky looks black, cloudy and relatively normal. The designs of the new villains are great, especially Killer Croc, who never seemed as menacing, to me anyway, in the original series. Lesser known villain Spellbinder, who was a villain in Batman Beyond, gets a great upgrade. From a rather silly, orange suited suit to a three eyed mystic. Like Joker, I was a off-put by the Riddler's new look, bringing singer Marilyn Manson to mind. The guy's so thin, he shouldn't be able to lift his cane. But, like the Clown Prince of Crime, the Prince of Puzzlers' look grew on me.Again the voices are good and even Gina Gershon improves, though she was only good for one out of her two appearances this season. Steve Harris again gets a moment to shine in Meltdown, the sequel episode to last season's finale. How he changes from wanting revenge to embracing his criminal identity is moving (for this show anyway). While John Glover will probably remain my favorite voice of Riddler, Robert Englund (who everyone pretty much knows) was a great find, making the villain sound intelligent and cruel, even when spouting one of the show's trademark, eye-rolling puns. Ron Perlman (Clayface from B: TAS) does a great job with Killer Croc, infusing him with a Cajun accent and a sense of menace and intelligence that never felt captured in the original series. In that series, other than two episodes (not counting the one with Batman disguised as Croc), he became just a stupid, comic relief villain. Another 1960s Batman star, Frank Gorshin (the Riddler), voices Prof. Hugo Strange in one of his last roles before his death (which is unfortunate since Strange became one of the better villains on this show). One person who increasingly grew on my nerves was Jesse Corti's Chief Rojas. It's really more the writers' fault than the actor, but the character is never remotely likeable. All he does is yell at his force for the things they don't do instead of actually helping them find and trap the Batman.Another thing I stupidly left out of my season 1 review was the music. My God is it bland. Even the opening theme is boring. I guess after the nineties ended, original music for cartoons (other than the DCAU) ended as well. It's all so unoriginal that its grating to hear the synth soundtrack. The only bit of music I do like is the Joker's leitmotif whenever he's around. It's quirkiness suits the character to a T.The writers, who all seemed like hacks in season 1, really stepped up to make this season an improvement, though the season opener felt like it was written for a different hero/villain (actually it seemed like something Ra's al Ghul might've done though the Batman Returns feel of the three main characters helped a bit). The one thing the writers never really learned to do in the entire run of the show was balance the appearances of the villains. In these thirteen episodes alone, Joker appeared five times while Penguin has shown up four (and two of them featured Joker). While popular villains in their own right, the two were overexposed to the point that nobody ever really wanted to see them. While Joker's backstory will always remain a mystery and Penguin's backstory explained in his first appearance, no other villain received any amount of background (other than Clayface last season and Riddler in season 4). Heck, Catwoman and Riddler both got two episodes this season but nothing was really done with them. The theme of this season seemed to be that of partnerships. While Batman and Det. Ellen Yin formed theirs last season, the villains were teaming up out of the woodworks; from the slave-like partnership of Penguin and Man-Bat to the unlikely pairing of Mr. Freeze and Firefly (just go with it, that's what I did). Episodes that I liked include Riddled (Riddler's first appearance), Swamped (Killer Croc's first appearance along with the start of Batman's trophy room), Meltdown (wherein Ethan Bennett becomes a villain), The Butler Did It (where Alfred's intelligence is finally shown), Grundy's Night (just a fun Halloween episode) and Night and the City (where Batman faces the threat of Joker, Penguin and Riddler).Season two was great though a few episodes were not up to standard.",The Batman: Season 2

Dr Ryan, is a successful self help speaker who helps people deal with grief and loss, but cannot deal with his own issues.  Eloise Chandler is a florist with several 'lost' relationships.  Through the film both main characters dodge what is happening, and when they least expect it, love truly happens.So much for the summary.Unlike man films with truly predictable outcomes and even dialogue, Love Happens, falls just outside the envelope.  It is not predictable, but more believable as far as scripting goes.  Not sappy, but sappy enough for the lover of chick flicks, it strikes the right chord.Both Aniston and Eckhart are believable in their roles.

The back cover's plot synopsis reads well, too. There's even a quote from some faux reviewer who believes this film to be a blend of Saw and a spaghetti western. No, no, NO. Nearly every aspect of this film conspires to put the viewer to sleep. I fell asleep three times, something I've never ever done during a movie before. To begin, the credits last for over five minutes?! And then there are the freeze frames. It's as if the director just learned a new trick. If you took all the freeze frames out, this movie would be half as long. The plot, the dialogue, the characters and the action sequences are all painful and improbable. There are no great shoot-outs, no crisp repartee, no characters to identify with, and no reason to suspend disbelief. This is just one long, lousy movie.

268280,"Looking at 'The Big Trail' for the first time, in it's original 70mm 'Grandeur' WideScreen presentation on this DVD, it's so crisp and clear, and mammoth in scope, it's hard to believe this is one of the early talkies from 1930! Everything about this movie is big, when you hear on the extras, of what had to be carted all over 7 states for the location shooting, and the fact they virtually had to make 5 films at once, it's incredible it ever got made at all. Fate stepped in, as it sometimes does, in the form of the Great Depression, cinemas shelved plans to convert to bigger screens and projectors, and when 'The Big Trail' was released, was mainly only seen in the regular 35mm version, diminishing much of the scope and grandeur that makes it so wonderful! Because of this, it was considered a flop, and never got the accolades it deserved! Now, 80 years later, we can re assess and enjoy this great film, the way it should have been all along! In his first starring role, 23 year old John Wayne is more than adequate, relaxed and commanding from the word go, and his beautiful 19 year old leading lady, Marguerite Churchill, is one of his best, a fine and fiesty little actress, she should have become a much bigger star! Watching them in this film, it's hard to reconcile the fact they're both long gone, and would have been over 100 years old now? They'll forever be young and beautiful, on 'The Big Trail'! In his only talking film, Tyrone Power Snr. is a far cry from the handsome matinee idol he apparently was on stage, and his son became, as the chief 'baddy' he's made up to look quite gruesome, and hams it up accordingly! Wayne's best friend, Ward Bond can be seen in a few scenes, hiding behind a bushy beard, ironic to think he started out on a wagon train, and finished up on one 30 years later! If the great depression hadn't intervened, this film may have revolutionised the way we saw movies in the 1930's, instead of having to wait another 23 years for CinemaScope?Anyone who's a John Wayne fan, or, is interested in Hollywood history, must own this DVD!",N/A

410788,"I think, not having read the book, which this is truly a wonderful production. I also understand that the book must be quite different so if you have read the book please expect some difference as it is quite normally the case that when you read a book - the following movie does not meet expectations. I make this comment based on a reviewer that doesn't not like the movie, but basing feeling on the book - which may be fair, or unfair.So, to reiterate as a viewer with no expectations based on the movie  - brilliantly stunning and educational. My 8 year old watched this and also could feel lessons being unraveled. She liked the power of literacy and brought select sections to her class to share at school.I would not just show this to young kids without viewing it and considering the kids, the ecology of such a decision would simply be wrong - but if you feel fit - a child can get a lot out of this movie. Well done !",Night John VHS
1251476,"If you consider the sum to be strictly the whole of its parts, this movie should get a negative ranking, i.e., less than 0/5 stars.  If for no other reason than some of the acting being quite possibly the worst I've ever seen, it should fail.  However, I have to say I found something enjoyable in this film.  Sure it is nothing more than a take on Hostel, and even glimmers of House on Haunted Hill, but it was fun.  I know this review is going to sound terribly unhelpful, but I encourage you to give it at least a rental shot.  Certainly not recommending a purchase, but a rental isn't a terrible choice.",Skeleton Crew
1366677,"I am a fan of FG.  I own all 7 volumes.  But this stand alone episode release left me wondering if this title warranted a lone release, over simply being included in their usual 1/2 season release.  I had very few laughs and mostly felt either bored or wanting.  It seemed like a message piece, rather than the usual over top satire of a very serious topic:Abortion.  I usually enjoy FG dvd's repeatedly, but this one will not be viewed more than perhaps twice. It simply is NOT worth the 10.00 to own.  Wait for it to be on the clearance table or used, it simply is that bad.  I wanted to laugh, but couldn't even force myself.  Usually FG has me cracking up throughout, but this one took itself too seriously and it failed to launch comedically.  The only saving grace is the almost live special, table read, etc.  Very disappointed.",N/A

Especially with an $80.00 price tag on it.Through further research, I discovered that this was originally a 2 part, made for television mini-series which aired on CBS in 1977. I had also discovered references of this being an HBO acquisition from CBS at some point in time.Originally airing at 215 minutes long, this DVD had been cut up, (or down) to 123 minutes. Surely not a true representation of the original mini-series.'Someone' out there has the current rights to re-release this mini-series, and in it's entirety. Obviously there is a market for it, and I will contact CBS, HBO or whoever has those rights currently, and inquire about a new release of the original full length mini-series.Not some cut up version of it, that some studio that secures temporary rights to produce a DVD, made an abortion out of.",N/A
1328965,"I really wanted to see this movie because like the Andy Garcia character, I have taken acting classes and can sympthaize with what he went through. Also as a resident of a town not far from City Island, the location filming is excellent.City Island is a movie about many things, mainly about the Andy Garcia character's secrets that he keeps from his family. His wife played by Julianna Margulies, thinks that he is having an affair, something much worse than what he actually is doing. Garcia's confident is a woman however. His son is obsessed with fat women and his daughter is secretly working as a stripper. Matters are made worse by the arrival of his illegitimate son from prison.City Island is a good indie film about families. I know dysfunctional families has been done a million times, but this seemed to feel alright. The movie has a certain charm about it that I thought was pretty refreshing. I didn't understand why Alan Arkin was in it as his character is on screen for about five minutes.I wouldn't buy City Island as I can't see myself ever watching it start to finish again but it was a nice indie movie. Andy Garcia stepped away from his usual characters and it worked perfectly.",N/A
1055731,"This was a pretty good pay per view. Here is some of my thoughts on the matches.1. Hardy Boyz (c) vs. Lance Cade and Trevor Murdoch for the Tag Team ChampionshipI think this was an awesome tag team Match and a great way to start off the night. A lot of close pinfalls. There were some points where it looked as Cade and Murdoch were going to win, but in the end the Hardy Boyz pull it out and I was happy with the result. Match rating: 8/102. Melina (c) vs. Mickie James for the Womens Championship:What was funny, cause I was there live for this PPV, the moment the match started it seemed as half the people took a bathroom break or concession stand break. The match itself was not really that bad, I was hoping Mickie James won but It wasnt that bad. Some great technical wrestling and it was alright. Match Rating 4/103: Chris Benoit (c) vs. MVP for the United States TitleDespite how Chris Benoit's life wound up he was a great technical wrestler. He was great at what he did. MVP put on a great technical wrestler. This match was a technical wrestling masterpiece. The right person won.  Match rating: 9/104. Bobby Lashley (c) vs. Shane McMahon, Vince McMahon and Umaga: Three on one match for the ECW titleThis was the worse match of the night. Everything about this match was wrong. Vince McMahon winning the title was an embarrasment to the history of ECW. Making sure he won was an embarrasment to ECW. It woulda come out better for Umaga winning the title. Horrible, Horrible and horrible. Match rating 1/105. Undertaker (c) vs. Batista. Last Man Standing Match for the World Heavyweight TitleAlthough the match ended with a draw. This match should have been the main event: It was an awesome Match. Every Match in tis feud had match of the year possibilities, Everything went right, finishers hit, great stuff, The Leg Drop through the table was something. Both getting up at 9, after the finisher was hit on the other. I wish Undertaker was the decisive winner, but wow it was a good decision to draw out the feud. Match Rating: 10/106: John Cena (c), Shawn Michaels, Edge and Randy Orton for the WWE ChampionshipThis was the second best match of the night. All four did great. I am not giving it a ten cause the creative writers to me messed up the ending and this match ahould have taken place when the Undertaker vs. Batista spot ...Nice Counters a lot of great false finishes. The dumbest part to me  was when Shawn Michaels hit Sweet Chin Music to see John Cena to fall back on Orton was stupid. Shawn Michaels shoulda have been able to pin Cena at that point for the title. If Cena was gonna win, could have just had Cena hit is finisher and cover for the 123. Shawn hit his kick, dont use that for Cena to cover someone. Before that took place, awesome match, but when that happen it brought it down a bit and with thatbeing said the Match Rating: 9/10",WWE: Backlash 2007
139293,"Viewed: 9/10Rate: 79/10: The most interesting thing about Red Dawn is the lack of restraint when it comes to its somewhat all-star cast. As a matter of fact, none of the cast is the central focus of the picture. Rather, the director is more interested in the guerilla tactics and the willingness of the characters to survive in a futuristic War War III picture. Red Dawn is quite good and interesting at the same time. I was kind of expecting Toy Soldiers, but I didn't quite see this coming. A few things that I loved about the movie are: its dramatic quick introduction with the paratroopers, the settling in of the situation as it becomes grave, and the moment where one of the members of Wolverine has been found a traitor and how the group dealt with him. The last part was unexpected and very pleasantly welcomed. There is one gripe I have with the movie; everybody just looked good after a month had gone by...then two months...then three and so on. It's too unrealistic. It's impossible for their hair to be this neat and all nicely trimmed after living in the woods. How did they take showers and remain tidy? Apart from that, Red Dawn is a great survival picture to watch. It pretty much explains the type of folks (remember the character by Bruce Dern from Tremors?) who build bomb shelters, stockpile all the food and guns, and wait for nuclear holocaust. For anyone interested in some movie history, Red Dawn is Charlie Sheen's first film, and he will go on to have a moment with Jennifer Grey, also his co-star of the film, in Ferris Bueller's Day Off. At same time, Patrick Swayze, also in Red Dawn, will go on make history with Jennifer Grey in Dirty Dancing.",N/A
1256868,"Sometimes you watch a film with disinterest and by its conclusion are suddenly captivated and charmed. ""The Man Who Loved Cat Dancing,"" an oddly named 1973 western romance (based on the early 1970's bestsellerThe Man Who Loved Cat Dancingby Marilyn Durham), is one of those films. It's practically forgotten today, with faded stars breathing life into a western genre dying fast. One of the beauties of the Internet is the ability to investigate a movie's back story, and this one certainly had a troubled production including changes in directors and musical composers, plus Sarah Miles' assistant committing suicide.There's an undeniable chemistry between stars Burt Reynolds and Miles, and through all the on-set controversy, they carve interesting performances rivaling the best work of their unique careers. It's an engaging, if implausible, oater as aristocratic wife Catherine Crocker (Miles) decides to run away from her wealthy husband (George Hamilton). She stumbles upon a train robbery where she's kidnapped by the motley outlaws and forced to travel cross-country through the desert. They are doggedly tracked by a posse, led by a salt-of-the-earth sheriff (Lee J. Cobb) and, of course, the unusually foppish husband.Miles sleeps next to campfires, avoiding rape on a nightly basis. The leader of the crew is, of course, Reynolds, a soft-hearted man with a past who eventually becomes Miles' protector, sparking their slowly budding romance. This was an interesting performance for Reynolds at an important phase of his career, post-Deliveranceand pre-Smokey and the Bandit - Special Edition. He has undeniable physical presence, adorned in beard and dusty clothes, usually chomping a cigar. While Reynolds eventually fell into mostly comedic roles, this was a rare opportunity to play a brooding man of action, and he displays an appealing confidence on the level of Clint Eastwood.Miles, with doe eyes and stubborn disposition, almost steals the film with an enormously sympathetic performance that, under the right circumstances, could have garnered an Oscar nomination. An eccentric free spirit in real life, the behind-the-scenes controversy of her assistant committing suicide (while Miles' husband Robert Bolt was in England, she was having a sporadic affair with her assistant and, in a jealous rage over time spent with Reynolds, he evidently took sleeping pills) had much to do with fans ignoring this film. Original director Brian Hutton also dropped out to be replaced by Richard C. Sarafian (hot off the success ofVanishing Point). In addition, producers publicly clashed over the screenplay and, finally, a very young John Williams (pre-Jaws (30th Anniversary Edition)super-stardom) was carted in overnight to write a subtle but likable score (The Man Who Loved Cat Dancing- arguably one of his best) after the original composer's work was rejected. It was a turbulent production.Through it all, you have the extraordinary cinematography of veteran Harry Stradling, Jr., taking full advantage of the colorful locales of Arizona and Utah. A fine supporting cast, including Jack Warden and Bo Hopkins in villainous form, and Cobb as Sheriff Lapchance, deliver unique dialog most likely lifted straight from Durham's novel. Warden, especially, displays uneasy menace as one of the more sadistic villains to be found in a western. Many criticize ""The Man Who Loved Cat Dancing"" because of its harsh violence, with fights to the death, rape and one brutal sequence where a man is shot in the groin, though granted it was poetic justice. Ultimately, I believe, the frontier violence is an intense contrast to the tender Reynolds/Miles romance, as they find love in the most unlikely places.There are extreme missteps in this film, including the miscasting of Hamilton in a crucial role. Filmmakers also chose to have Reynolds shave his beard about two-thirds in so we have the famous mustache, giving him a far-too-urban look when all that had come before was intentionally rustic. Burt was giving a fine performance (one of the five best of his career, along with ""Deliverance,""Boogie Nights,Starting OverandBreaking In) and there was no need to revert to sex symbol pop persona. When the dust finally clears, we have a flawed but touching film. Perhaps cursed by history, this gently engrossing work is deserving of discovery, with a unique beauty if in the right frame of mind.",N/A
696857,"While this film may not make it into the ""classic"" category, I've surely seen a lot of movies which were much, much worse.  This one is colorful, well-acted, and tries its very best to do justice to the sprawling plot of Alexandre Dumas' 1200-page novel.Of course, as any screenwriter has learned, it's not just difficult but impossible to shoehorn a huge novel into a film.  Therefore, entire swathes of the novel's plot wind up in the waste-basket, characters are blended together, and so on.  The one alteration I found most interesting was the story of the grand love affair between the Count (Edmond Dantes) and Mercedes.  In the novel, the two lovers face up to the decades of betrayal and part ways.  As I recall, Mercedes retires to the country or goes into a convent, while Edmond frees his ""Greek slave"" and marries her.  In this movie, Edmond and Mercedes forgive one another and go on to perpetual bliss. (There is no ""Greek slave"" --- she wound up in the wastebasket with all the other stuff, including the lesbian runaways.)I really think (and hope) that this whole business of turning novels into movies is going to learn something from Peter Jackson's ""Lord of the Rings"" --- or from the TV mini-series.  Producers should STOP chopping and maiming the original story to cram it into a narrow time frame: they should take just as much time as needed to tell the complete story.Of course, that's just me sayin'.  :-)This is a good movie!  But it could have been a lot better!",N/A
422513,"I remember seeing this as the bottom part of a double-feature when I was nine years old.  And while I knew it was a low budget movie, I figured I would give it another shot.  I decided to watch the dvd with the audio commentary by two of the major special effects guys at ILM.  It was the first time I can remember an audio commentary wherein the commentators knew very little about the film they were talking about.  They were wrong about the year it was released (1959) and did not know the name of the star of the film (Gene Evans) although they did admit to seeing him before.  Most of their commentary was talking about the endless padding needed to bring this film to its almost 90 minute length, since the film did not have the budget for many special effects and as a result the monster was seen very infrequently.  They described how boring it must have been for a 12 year old to sit through this film.  (I was nine and don't really remember being tremendously bored.)  I did enjoy them comparing this film to some of Harryhausen's although they did throw Spielberg's name in for some reason, I guess to show us that they were two of the major special effects technicians on ""Jurassic Park.""  I wish they would have discussed the director's (Eugene Lourie) next giant monster film ""Gorgo"" a little more.  I've always enjoyed that film.As for the film itself, the special effects are pretty poor in this black and white film.  If you want a pretty mediocre sci. fi film from the '50s, but a fairly good indication of the type of low budget sci. fi. extravaganzas they made in those days, then you will enjoy this film.  I grew up during this period and loved the sci. fi., horror and fantasy films of my childhood.  However, I'll take ""Godzilla,"" ""Gorgo"" or any of Harryhausen's films over this one any day.",The Giant Behemoth VHS

855873,"I own many performances of ""Giselle"" but this is, by far, my favorite.  It's possible to find a DVD performance with a more stellar touch here or there; but, overall, this performance is as close to perfection in all aspects of production as one is likely to find.  High praise, I know, but I think it's merited.There is an overall ""ensemble"" feel to this performance.  Everyone seems to be operating at the same level of excellence and commitment and on the same ""wave"" as to interpretation.  The synchronization of the corps - whether manifested by a single couple, several couples together or the whole company - is exceptional.  Quite honestly, I have seen productions by world-famous companies (no names mentioned) which fall far, far below the standards exhibited by this company.  If they dance like this all the time, they should be at the top of anyone's list!Not only are they together as a group, but there is a singular grace and ease to their dancing that one doesn't always see.  They are, in fact, so unified in style and execution that one can easily overlook just how wonderful they are.  They make it seem so easy and normative that one forgets how exceptional what they do really is.  I wish I knew more about the different national ""schools""; but there is something about this performance as a whole and in the individual style of each dancer which reminds me of Russia.  There isn't a moment of stiffness in anything they do, no matter how complicated; easeful, fluid grace is the best I can do as a description, and they seem to enjoy what they're doing.  If the steps are racking them with pain, there is not the slightest indication of it for the audience.If you want a minus, then I single out the boorish behaviour of the audience, especially in Act 2, for special note.  Seldom have I heard such disrespect from an audience for its fellows or for the artists as this one manifests.  What do I mean?  Coughing.  My god, you'd think the whole performance had been filmed in a tubercular ward.  But even with that the performance is so magical that one can forget such behavioural interruptions.I could go on and on, but suffice it to say that, once I've watched a DVD of Giselle, I normally skip over all but the beginning and ending of Act 1 and go straight to the real glory, Act 2.  BUT...in the case of this performance, I have found myself watching the whole of Act 1 because it was just so very lovely, graceful and joyful to watch.  What more can I say?  I suppose you might not like this performance, so individual is preference; but I find it hard to believe in this case that anyone will be disappointed in owning such a ""Giselle"".Highest marks.

The DVD quality is excellent, but the story only mediocre.We certainly get a sense of the kind of warfare and weapons involved, as well as the odds against the Finns.  The film is too long, probably due to the fact that, if I understand correctly, it originally aired as a television mini-series over multiple nights.  Perhaps the seemingly endless progression of battles is presented in the name of realism, but this IS a movie, after all, and we get the idea after the 7th or 8th ( or 11th or 12th? ) Russian charge.The acting is tepid all 'round. No one really stands out as memorable.Great equipment and lovely footage of the Finnish landscape.  Never could figure, though, why the Russians kept wasting artillery throughout the film chasing the featured character around the countryside.  Whenever a particular Finnish soldier was going toward or away from the front lines, the Russian artillery would magically always hit right around this one lone, poor soul.  Smart shells in 1939?  And Soviet aircraft dropping entire bomb loads trying to hit a soldier on a sleigh?  Not very believable.Still, the battle scenes seemed well done and the unimaginative and very costly Soviet head-on assaults are true to history.  The vast disparity in men and materiel available to the two sides and the grinding exhaustion to which the Finns were subjected are important factors handled well.All-in-all, a good movie but certainly not amongst the best of the genre. Most probably the best for the Winter War.",The Winter War VHS
1252249,"NOTE:  This is the SAME workout that was originally marked under the title ""Squeeze.""In her Introduction to this workout, instructor Tracy Effinger describes it as a combination of yoga, ballet, and athletic exercises. Unlike with many other barre workouts, Tracy wears sneakers throughout here. She instructs live in an indoor studio setting, although during the workout, the scene shifts to images of her exercising on a rooftop setting as well. She uses light dumbbells for the upper body work--she recommends 1-3 lbs. but states that she is using 2 lbs.--and for the lower body, she uses a chair, a mat, and a rubber playground ball (I substituted a Pilates ring, which worked pretty well).The Main Menu of this DVD offers three options: Full Body Squeeze, Power Squeeze, and Custom Squeeze. Only the Custom Squeeze section has its own submenu, which makes the DVD somewhat difficult to navigate (more on this below). I have broken down each of the three workout options, including approximate times and brief descriptions of each chapter point.FULL BODY SQUEEZE (56.5m)*Warmup (2m)--Tracy performs the knees up/arms up usually found in barre workouts, but she also does knees/arms to the side. She ends with a forward bend stretch.*Arms (8m)--This segment definitely burns the shoulders; the weights might feel light at first, but you will feel it towards the end! Tracy does variations of lateral raises, shoulder presses, and chest presses; she also incorporates a bit of biceps work.*Triceps (4m)--You start in a traditional 1-arm kickback position, except that Tracy has you perform pulses with the arm straight; she does several variations. I felt this the next day!*Waist (3.5m)--Standing in a wide-legged stance and still holding the weights, Tracy does reaches both overhead and down to the ankles.*Push-Ups (4m)--Tracy sets up to perform push-ups on the knees, doing one set of 2-count push-ups and then a second set double-time. She also performs tricep dips on the floor, adding in a leg raise to up the challenge. A brief seated stretch for both the triceps and the hips concludes this segment.*Standing Stretch Series (&lt;3m)--Tracy uses the chair to stretch the hamstrings: you will place one foot on the chair, stretching over and around that leg, and then repeat on the other side (nice!).*Legs (5m)--This segment also uses the chair for barre work. Tracy includes the v-plie, the wide-leg plie, and ""the uncomfortable chair""; she also adds little twists, such as what she calls the ""John Travolta move."" She concludes with a quad stretch.*Seated Stretch (7m)--This nice long stretch segment begins on the floor with a camel variation, then moves into a lunge series which stretches both the hip flexors and the hamstrings, moving towards splits. Tracy ends with standing pyramid and standing forward bend.*The ""L"" (6m)--Here Tracy has you lie on your mat with your legs perpendicular to your body. She then moves you through many different variations on leg lifts to really get into the outer thighs and glutes; this is especially tough when you get to the SECOND leg!*The Abs ""C"" (5.5m)--This segment uses the ball, mostly between the thighs. Tracy forms a ""C"" shape with the torso and performs various curls in this position while squeezing the ball in place.*Buns & Thighs (4m)--This is a pelvic tilt series, but the unique aspect is that Tracy sets you up with your feet on the wall, with your legs forming a 90-degree angle. In this position, you perform various pelvic tilt variations, such as heels only, toes in, etc.*Final Stretch (3.5)--Tracy begins lying for happy babies pose (or dead bug); she also performs an lying straddle and reclined leg stretch. She ends seated in a full forward bend.POWER SQUEEZE (26m)*Warmup (1.5m)--This is a mini-version of the full warm-up; the side knee lifts are omitted.*Power Push-Ups (2.5m)--Here Tracy performs one set of 15 push-ups on the knees followed by a set of tricep dips on the floor. She again concludes with a seated stretch for the triceps and hips.*Standing Stretch Series (&lt;3m)--This is the SAME segment that is included in the Full Squeeze. Although I liked this section, it felt VERY out of place here--you haven't even started working your lower body yet, so why are you stretching it out?*Legs (1.5m)--Tracy states that she will be doing one quick set, and this definitely is quick; you use the ball and the chair for one set of dips on the toes.*The Pretzel (4m)--This section is new to the Power Squeeze. The Pretzel is a move in which you are seated on the mat with both legs bent at 90-degrees, one in front of you, and one behind; you lift the rear leg to work you buttocks.*Abs (5.5m)--Although this is another abs segment using the ball, it is different from the section on the Full Squeeze. Here Tracy performs more traditional crunch variations as opposed to the C-curve curls.*Buns & Thighs (3.5m)--Again, you set up with your feet on the wall for pelvic tucks. This time, however, Tracy has the ball between her thighs, adding inner thigh work in addition to the glute and hamstring work.*Final Stretch (3.5m)--SAME stretch as in the Full Squeeze.CUSTOM SQUEEZE (38.5)*Triceps (4m)--SAME as Full Squeeze*Arms (8m)--SAME as Full Squeeze*Seated Stretch (7m)--SAME as Full Squeeze*The Pretzel (4m)--SAME as Power Squeeze*The Fold Over Plank (5.5m)--This is a a segment of glutes work performed from a hands and knees (all fours) position. Tracy does mostly straight leg lifts but adds a few bent leg lifts towards the end.*The Flat Abs (6m)--In this variation on the abs work, Tracy is lying completely flat, with one leg crossed over the other, performing small crunches that really target the lower abs. However, she moves into some scissors work that is fairly advanced.*The Windshield Wiper Buns & Thighs (&lt;4m)--This is another section of pelvic tilts performed with the feet on the wall. In this segment, however, Tracy adds the knees moving in and out (i.e., the ""windshield wiper"" effect) as well as some 1-legged work.So, as you can see, this DVD provides a wide variety of options, including three different segments each of both pelvic tilts and abs work. However, I was quite disappointed that the DVD is not completely customizable. For example, I went to the ""Custom Squeeze"" menu hoping to select my own workout which would include the ""L"" segment from the Full Body Squeeze; however, as you can see from the above, the ""L"" is not included on the Custom Squeeze menu. The only way for me to select that section would be to choose the Full Body Squeeze workout option and then to skip through the chapters until I get to what I want--not very convenient! For this reason, I prefer Tracy's second DVD, Squeeze Stronger, to this one. Otherwise, I do enjoy Tracy's athletic approach to barre work and expect to get quite a bit of use from this DVD.",Squeeze: 30-Day Body Transformation
219230,"Cecil B. DeMille was known throughout his long career for ""spectacle"" movies that made the critics groan and the public cheer.  It was probably inevitable that at some point he'd turn his cameras on something else that makes people cheer: an old-fashioned circus-under-canvas (and, yes, Ringling Brothers was still doing the tent gig at this point in time).  But besides the delights of the circus itself--lions and elephants, aerialists and clowns--he knew that what makes a story is the people: their innate character, their relationships and interactions.  Brad Braden (Charlton Heston) is the road manager for the show, so tough and so devoted to its success that the aspiring aerialist Holly (Betty Hutton), who loves him, accuses him of having ""sawdust in his veins instead of blood.""  Holly in turn has spent her life struggling to be good enough for the center ring and is devastated when Braden engages the Great Sebastian (Cornel Wilde) in a bid to draw the customers in; this sets off a rivalry between the two performers as Holly tries to outdo Sebastian at every show--and, slowly, Brad begins to understand how much he cares about her.  Meanwhile Angel (Gloria Grahame), who works with the elephants, nurses an unrequited passion for Brad while attempting to fend off the jealous and possessive German pachyderm-trainer Klaus (Lyle Bettger).  Then there's the clown known only as Buttons (James Stewart), who literally lives in his whiteface makeup and has a secret that threatens his life--and, in the end, many other lives when the circus train suffers a catastrophic wreck (done in miniature but surprisingly well for the time).  The film is somewhat overlong thanks to the inclusion of a large roster of genuine Ringling performers doing their thing, but for me at least it's the backstage maneuverings and the glimpses of performer life and the technicalities of moving what amounts to a small village and setting up and taking down the show every few days that make it really worthwile.",N/A
38991,"Boris Karloff said that making films with Val Lewton helped restore his mental health. Karloff (1887-1969) started in films in 1916 and up until 1931 he was a bit player in B films. Then came ""Frankenstein"" (1931), ""The Mummy"" (1932) and ""The Mask of Fu Manchu"" (1932) and he was off on a whirlwind career that lasted for decades. In the 30s he either played the monster (Frankenstein, the Mummy) or an evil person (Dr. Fu Manchu), and he began to feel strangled by the stereotyping. Val Lewton came along and offered him a reprise from these stereotypes and a chance to do some real acting, even if it was still broadly within the ""horror"" genre.Val Lewton (1904-51) was the ""Head of Horror"" at RKO where he produced ""Cat People"" (1942), ""I Walked with a Zombie"" (1943), and ""The Leopard Man"" (1943) and teamed with Karloff on ""Isle of the Dead"", ""The Body Snatchers"" (1945), and ""Bedlam"" (1946).Lewton worked with Mark Robson (1913-78) who directed both films. He worked with Lewton on ""Cat People"" (1942) and ""I Walked with a Zombie"" (1943). He was twice nominated for an Oscar and a DGA award (""Peyton Place"" and ""Inn of the Sixth Happiness""), and twice nominated at Cannes (""Bright Victory"" and ""The Harder They Fall""). His best work was directing ""The Bridges at Toko-Ri"" (1954) and ""Champion"" (1949).These films are of interest from an historical perspective as they show Karloff in his first attempt to put aside the ""monster"" and do some real acting. He's not bad. Mind you, he's not great either.",N/A

He portrays an actual U.S. Air Force officer who was in civilian life a clergyman. Hess was involved in the famous ""Kiddy Car Airlift"" -- although, according to detractors, possibly not to the extent shown in the movie.The story itself is rewarding and for die-hard Hudson fans who would be happy merely to watch him declaim the telephone book, it's probably worthwhile.",Battle Hymn VHS

1300520,"When a golden review opportunity presents itself its going to get jumped on like its wearing a pink neglige and a Rod Stewart wig. On the heels of the awesome remake ofFriday the 13th (Theatrical Cut)and the very solid Halloween remakes the old boy Sid decided to give A Nightmare on Elf Street and Freddy Kruger a shot.Back in the glory days of horror, Freddy was a big player on par with Jason and Michael Myers even though Sid would put him #3 on that list by far. After seeing the new Freddy he is currently #86 on the scary list, one place ahead ofThe Gingerdead Man. Of course we all know the story, Freddy kills people through their dreams. Pretty scary idea but it only works if the dream killer isn't gunning to be the king of the one liners Henny Youngman and if he isn't built like a jockey. Countless times we thought ""Dream me would beat the snot out of Freddy."" The execution of this one had the tantalyzing scent of a Full Moon production so obviously that created really b moments of the did they think nobody would notice that variety. A staple for enjoyable b. However, Jackie Earl Haley, mostly known for his roles as Kelly Leak and Steve Nash's stunt double, played Freddy. Right there the possibility for scares went out the window so despite some great b moments this was a boring flick.This movie needed to be really good to compete with the other horror remakes we've seen lately and it fell as short as The Reflections music career. Myers and Jason got scarier in the remakes and especially in Jason's case, by a lot. Freddy, on the other hand, was the Vachs of horror villians, supposed to be intimidating but just hilarious. Because this one was barely decent it doesn't get Loomis but it does get the Frank Costanza Kruger my son tells me your company stinks!",N/A
1305811,"The first backlash against the film was, understandably, towards the young female character who talks dirty and likes to shoot people in the head. So, began the long stream of ""morally reprehensible"" laden reviews for a generation cultured on media violence to absorb...or not.Kick Ass thoroughly represents America's infatuation with violence, guns, and well...immorality. It's like witnessing a mass shooting firsthand. It's cold, ruthless and unforgiving. There are no redeemable qualities in really any of the characters. We see revenge, greed, and lust but we are not immersed in any heroism.This creates a visceral experience that I am not able to say that I disliked. Indeed, what makes this film so good is it's break from traditional character molds. It does not represent justified killing or a morality tale. It flies in the face of what critics like Roger Ebert look for in a film. That is a literary change portrayed on screen.However, does a lack of such criteria make this less than a film? Does it make it less of a social statement on the culture of violence? Sometimes, a film can succeed in greatness without teaching you something about morality. Sometimes, a film succeeds on it's cold realism alone. Does that make an eleven year old assassin any more realistic? No...but it livens the fact that not everything is traditional peaches n' cream.",N/A
318188,"Although it was filmed during the first and memorable cycles of Universal horror films, WEREWOLF OF LONDON is hardly in the same league with DRACULA, FRANKENSTEIN, or THE BLACK CAT.  Simply put, it lacks imagination.The story opens with botanist Dr. Wilfred Glendon (Henry Hull) in search of a rare flowering plant in the wilds of Tibet--but although he secures a specimen, Glendon is bitten by a werewolf in the process.  Once more returned to his wife Lisa (Valerie Hobson) in London, Glendon is approached by Dr. Yogami (Warner Oland), who makes somewhat cryptic comments about the Tibet, the flower, and werewolves.  It soon transpires that Yogami is the werewolf that attacked Glendon in Tibet and that the flower is the only antidote.  Yogami steals the flowers, leaving Glendon to transform into a ravening beast that is driven to kill his own wife.The story itself is entertaining and Jack Pierce's make-up effects are quite good.  Warner Oland walks away with the acting honors and Spring Byington is not far behind.  But the rest of the cast is remarkably uninspired.  Henry Hull was a noted stage actor, but he simply did not play well on the screen.  In WEREWOLF OF LONDON he seems unduly stiff in some scenes and excessively ripe in others.  Valerie Hobson was a pleasant performer, but she is not particularly memorable here; Lester Matthews is utterly non-descript; and Ethel Griffies and Zeffie Tilbury quickly wear out their welcome in the roles of competing (and besotted) boarding house landladies.  Diector Stuart Walker's pacing seems clumsy and irregular, there is nothing interesting in the editing or designs.  The movie isn't bad enough to be truly bad, but neither is it good enough to be truly good--and it is mightily overshadowed by the later Lon Chaney Jr. film THE WOLF MAN.

1257523,"I already had the first release of this entertaining series but like some people have said the video and audio did have some flaws with that set and after hearing about this set was very interested but was still undecided on if I really should purchase it.  After finally deciding to acquire the remastered set I see it was definitely the right choice,  the frame rate clears a lot of the scenes up to a greater clarity especially with the background and the lip-synch movements of the characters during scenes and the audio has been greatly touched up as well.  During fight scenes with the original set the sound was still great but the sounds would reverb to much in some scenes, and sometimes you would hear volume fluctuations like when a character was talking their voice would be normal volume than sometimes lower for no apparent reason, with this set the battle scenes have been greatly improved and you can hear some added background effects too and the volume level is kept at a steady leveled rate or raising or lowering of the volume for unknown reasons. If you already have the first original set and are worried if this set doesn't have the added features than no worries this set has the whole bonuses that the first set had as well,  the series episodes come on two of the dvds and the bonus features as well as the two extras OVA episodes come on the third dvd in the set.

Literally the only two sequences that make any sense at all are the first and the last. Everything between is just jumbled nonsense. The acting is worse still, with hardly any characterization or personality to distinguish one person from the next. I'm having a difficult time believing that M.N.

The second year stormed onto television screens in the fall of 1980 with the arrival of beautiful Donna Mills in the role of Sid's sister Abby Cunningham. The producers wisely realized what was missing from the ""Knots Landing"" canvas was a good villin, so Abby arrived and shooked things up in the cul-de-sac. This casting stunt would later be replicated on ABC's ""Dynasty"" with the arrival of Joan Collins.Like its other seasons and unlike other primetime soaps, ""Knots Landing"" was far more realistic in their story-telling depicting issues that often made headlines such as rape, alcoholism, and hostage situations, the later which was used in an early season two episode where the women of ""Knots Landing"" were held captive by a bunch of maniacs while holding a baby shower. This particular episode is still one of my favorite ""Knots Landing"" shows.This four disc set includes all 18 season two episodes, but is sparce on bonuses.The season finished at #28 in the national Nielsen's with a 15.1 rating.Sadly, like season one this set of ""Knots..."" didn't sell very well and there are currently no plans for the studio to release future DVD's.

The ""zombie girl"" in this film is the victim, and the people surrounding her are the true monsters to fear.Most of the horror value in this film comes from watching the disturbing decisions being made by the boys that find her. Watching them torture the abandoned patient they find is what will have your gasping. Of course most of it is exagerated. You don't really see them do anything to her so it's pretty tasteful...calling the film raunchy or anything else is only to discredit this horror flick. This movie is more about morality than anything else.A bunch of boys find themselves upon a naked girl chained to a bed and to top if off she has supermodel looks. They know no one is going to come looking for her...and it's obvious that she won't go anywhere... so what do they do?Well.... that's what the movie is about.

1231793,"For those who've grown just a wee bit tired of all those ""family-friendly"" animated features we've been inundated with over the years, I commend to you ""Fantastic Mr. Fox,"" Wes Anderson's sly little creation that, for once, is aimed less at the kids in the audience than at the adults. Not that it is particularly crude or vulgar - it's certainly no ""Fritz the Cat,"" and even the swearing is covered-over by the characters uttering a generic ""cuss"" - but its themes and dialogue are pitched at a generally higher level of sophistication than we are accustomed to in such works.Based on a book by the beloved Roald Dahl, the story focuses on the dapper Mr. Fox, a recovering chicken thief who, at the behest of his wife, has given up his predatory ways in favor of domestic responsibility as a husband and father and a career as a newspaper columnist. What could be more respectable than that?  But old habits die hard, and Mr. Fox soon discovers he must remain true to his carnivorous nature, leading him to enlist a few of his friends and neighbors of various species in a scheme to raid some local farms and make off with their poultry. This lands him and his buddies in hot water with both the owners of the farms and the heavily armed authorities who are called in to support them.Like Anderson's live-action works, ""Fantastic Mr. Fox"" (co-written by Noah Baumbach) owes much of its charm to the scattered, random and quirky nature of the material and its presentation, with a narrative so full of side forays and offbeat, eccentric characters that the movie feels as if it's constantly renewing itself as it's going along. There is wonderful voice work by George Clooney, Meryl Streep, Jason Schwartzman, Bill Murray, Owen Wilson and Willem Dafoe, clever in-joke references to spaghetti westerns and ""Rebel Without a Cause,"" a funny subplot involving Fox's son and his obsession with proving his athletic prowess to his inattentive dad, and a simple, clean, streamlined look that combines a minimum of stop-motion movement with remarkably true-to-life backgrounds.It may not be a great animated film, but it is one of the more original and refreshing ones we've come across in quite some time.",Fantastic Mr. Fox

In general, the film tells the story of an individual having the ability to enter one's dreams and direct their behavior, but he remains locked up in a psych ward.  If you make eye contact or he otherwise telepathically hunts you down, you're his minion.  Unfortunately, the movie was half good.  The awake scenes were somewhat slow and discontinuous; the story jumped around and things happened without any particular logical sequence.  The dream scenes, on the other hands, were very cool.  Comparisons to Hell Raiser are somewhat accurate, although Hell Raiser was much more graphically and violently intense than this film is.  Dreamers are in this surreal world populated by fiendish demon-like creatures who flit around, obviously stalking their prey - very creepy.

444886,"Analogous to Expect The Unexpected (1998) and The Longest Nite (1998) Patrick Yau is the nominal director in The Odd One Dies but did not do the majority of directing (though Yau has stated of those three films he had the most input with this one). The uncredited director is Johnnie To, whose production company is Milkyway Image with Wai Ka-Fai who wrote the screenplay, that was the force behind the film. Aside from those three films (which I have seen) Patrick was credited to one more film The Loser's Club (2001) and apparently his film career has been over since then. However, when watching the movie it is easy to see many familiar elements of To including genre (shashou pian: professional killer genre), incorporation of humor and Lam Suet.Takeshi Kaneshiro is a laconic street thug called Mo who is either on a death wish or just does not care. I see a bit of this character in Louis Koo's performance in Throw Down (2004), but when you watch this it is hard not to think of Takeshi's two previous Wong Kar-wai roles (Chungking Express (1994), Fallen Angels (1995)) as well. Takashi after losing much money in gambling decides to take on a hired killer role for 88,000 HK dollars cash. First he gets himself an old large mobile phone, sunglasses, chain, watch, used car with a capricious bumper and a jacket. How he gets those items is quite hilarious. Since he is just does not care, he gambles a good portion of that money away as well. He loses thousands after thousands, doubling his bet every time with a local card shark named George (Lee Diy-yue), without as much as a wince when he loses. But then the strangest thing happens, he starts to win and he wins big. Then he decides to hire someone else to do the killing.The newly hired killer is, much to his surprise, a female (Carman Lee Yeuk-tung) who is just out of jail from a previous man-slaughter case and she is just as laconic as he is. They both smoke quite a lot and almost appear to be Doppelganger's of each other.* However, she is malodorous and unkempt. They, of course, become attached to each other. Now what is he going to do about the hit?I had a lot of fun watching this movie. I had so much merriment that I did the rare thing and watched it twice within a week which I had not done with another film in years. There is a peculiar comedic style to this that is dark, but still quite good. This includes a recurring fingers dismemberment joke when the Triad character Tony (Korean actor Byun Woo-min) catches a knife from both Takeshi and later Carman is brutally hilarious but also leads to a strong scene of redemption at the end. The direction is also quite quirky. You get a great look of Hong Kong in this film which is another trademark of many of Johnnie To's work. There is an excellent scene of Takeshi running around a busy area crossing one street after another. He is almost hit several times and it is great to see the passerby expression (many of these movies will be filmed with many people not knowing they are being filmed). All filmed with no or very few cuts. In fact it is quite reminiscent to a similar scene in Police Story 2 (1988) with Jackie Chan but with better results for Takeshi.I really wish these early Milkyway films like this one, The Longest Nite (1998) and The Mission (1999) would get more recognition especially amongst more mainstream critics. This has been slowly changing over the years with Stephen Teo's book on Johnnie To as well as David Bordwell adding a section on To in his updated book Planet Hong Kong. But as a fan of these movies such as this one it still is not enough. I know fans of Johnnie To and Hong Kong crime films will enjoy this, but this is a good film for people who are not familiar with those to start with.This Mei Ah R0 1997 DVD is not the easiest film to get a hold of as there is no R1 edition out there or any non-OOP version anywhere. It looks exactly like a LD port and I have read that some copies do not necessarily work on all DVD players. Thank goodness mine did. There are no extras unfortunately. There are Chinese and English subtitles (surprisingly decent subtitles) and Cantonese and Mandarin language tracks. This film is desperately in need of an update and rerelease.Johnnie To has stated that in an interview: ""we didn't deliberately set out to copy Wong Kar-wai. I don't copy other people's stuff. The film is about loneliness and it's possible that it shows a tendency to Wong Kar-wai."" My own personal opinion is that the biggest similarity is Takeshi Kaneshiro's performance. While some have stated the cinematography resembles Wong's work, I feel it is just because of the use of hand-held and overuse of canted angles (possibly more of them then in The Third Man (1949)). The issue of expiring time is familiar (Chungking Express) but I feel that is prevalent of Hong Kong cinema as a whole since the handover was to happen a little over a month after the release of this film. Plus one of the strongest thematic elements for Wong's oeuvre the ever-present ""unrequited love"" is missing from this film.* The Doppelganger is another recurrent theme in To's films as well as the use of motifs. When watching this movie look for a massive amount of scenarios repeated for a second time or third time. The last time the scenario happens it signals a change. For example, when Takeshi meets Simon for the second time he beats him up. When Carmen sees him she fantasizes about killing him, but leaves him without doing anything. When Takeshi tries to stab the Triad member for the third time (Carmen did it the second time), he does not go through with the motion to remove his fingers and ultimately receives the forgiveness of him. Takeshi apologizes to George the third time they meet. There are many more throughout the film sometimes with the Doppelganger taking the place of the protagonist.",The Odd One Dies

180725,"Viewed: 9/05Rate: 59/05: After viewing Cop Land, I was thinking how the plot came out unglued and stopped being coherent. Appearing to be a stellar cast, it is not shown by their performances. Robert DeNiro overacted a bit, Harvey Keitel was typical, Ray Liotta tried hard to imitate what he did during Goodfellas, and Sylvester Stallone didn't look right. On the other hand, Robert Patrick was great. At one interesting point, it was the Raging Bull meeting Rocky. I know the intensity is there during Cop Land, but the story, having a good deal of potential, was falling apart. At the same time, the logic wasn't there because the ending, to me, should have turned out to be different because there is no way that the sheriff would have finked to Ray, kept Superboy in the cell without alerting the NYPD or anyone else for that matter, and be dumb enough to have no backup in the morning prior to taking Superboy out. At least, Cop Land was watchable. There is a rip-off ending of Above the Law with the saying ""No one is above the law"" from Nixon's quotes. However, that climactic scene was pretty dramatic.",N/A

The family ends up purchasing a creepy house in the middle of nowhere which is filled with sinister secrets and strange occurrences.While this plot is predictable and has been pursued many times before, I still gave the film a chance because I liked the overall sense of suspense and eeriness that the movie projected.  However, Kevin Costner's portrayal of a conflicted father was definitely not ""academy award"" material, and many of the characters introduced and plot twists went nowhere.  Yet, the most disappointing part of the movie was the ending itself.  It was completely unbelievable, and I found myself asking, ""Seriously?  I am expected to buy into this?""I didn't pay to watch the movie, so I can't complain too much.

Usually they are not a very good workout, and aren't really belly dance oriented. There ARE a lot of good instructional Belly Dance DVDs out there. But I was really looking for something that would be about a 40+ minute workout, covering most of the techniques a beginner/intermediate needs to work on. A DVD that would not require that I have the remote in hand, hunting and pecking for this or that move in some ginormous table of contents, or fast forwarding past the repeated 20 minute discussion of ""tuck your hips, chest out, shoulders back"". Finding this DVD was like finding a jewel.This DVD is called a belly dance work out for beginners, but I will agree with another reviewer who said that it was not for rank beginners. I would say it's more for ""advanced beginners"". That said, most beginners will be able to follow most of the moves, even the first time they see it. There is a tutorial section that is broken down pretty well, and should help those who may find themselves overwhelmed, or unfamiliar with the name of a specific move (for instance, what Neon calls ""infinity loops"", my teacher calls ""figure eights"".)If you have been taking lessons, even if it's just a couple of months, you won't have too many surprises in terms of the basic techniques. However, you MAY find some familiar techniques put together in suprisingly different, but still lovely combinations.While I am not winded nor sweating by the end of this workout, I do feel like I am working all the joints and muscles commonly used in belly dance (class.)",N/A

1337071,"Reading the Amazon reviews within this release, I was taken aback by the fact that this was a Swedish miniseries and that this dvd release by E1 entertainment is a truncated version.  Well, truncated is better than nothing.  It is magnificent and harkens back to the old tried and true epics we fondly remember.  The director ,Peter Flinth, has given us a grand epic of honor and treachery all focused on the love story between Arn and Cecilia with religion, once again, separating true love. It contains so much passion with some great performances within its structure.  You will recognize of course Bibi Anderson as the mother superior and Sven Bertil Taube ( the only other movie I know of his is a guilty pleasure- 'PUPPET ON A CHAIN') as the Bishop also Steven Waddington from 'THE LAST OF THE MOHICANS' as the Grand Master of the Templar Knights. Sorry, I'm a sucker for these type of epics and this one reinforces my belief that other countries are making incredible product.  If you want an uplifting, soaring piece of filmmaking with breathtaking photography and a rousing music score by Toomas Kantelinen, click the add to cart button.  I just can't figure out why nobody has signed the actor who played Saladin-Milind Soman- to other projects over here.  He really steals the show. The release has two great featurettes on the making of the film which brings you up to speed on the production.  Highly recommended.",N/A
1015083,"I regret having purchased this particular DVD.  I love Sarah's concert DVDs and her audio CDs, but found this video collection for the most part very tacky.  She deserves better video directors who have a more coherent, dignified vision for canvassing her music.  And perhaps Sarah could come up with better visual ideas as well.  While the use of juxtaposition can work sometimes, when it doesn't work, it's horrid.  A big gamble there.One of the few videos I found interesting was ""Captain Nemo.""  It's multi-layered, and actually has something to do with the subject matter expressed by the lyrics.  I found the video of ""Ave Maria"" too obtuse to be interesting; how did being naked with scattered applications of gold leaf relate to the material?  It's a silly, irreverent approach.Most of the older videos unfortunately have not aged well; Ken Russell's contributions, especially.  While some see Russell as a visionary, I have often found his work to be rather sloppy and uninspiring.I found the interviews quite interesting and enjoyed hearing Sarah's take on them, but would have preferred the option of having the videos play with or without the commentaries for repeated listening.By the way, what's up with the Blair Witch camera man who can't stay still during the commentaries?  Argh!  Sit down and get a tripod, for Pete's sake!  One could get seasick while viewing.  And at one point where the camera simply goes in vertical circles like a Ferris wheel, or pauses to focus on her breasts, it's downright embarrassing.  Tacky, tacky, tacky.Speaking of breasts, I'm no prude (I find nudity to be quite natural), but I am always put-off by singers who feel the need to present themselves as whorish maidens, tawdry vixens, or outright sluts in steamy attire with coy, ""come hither"" expressions.  With incredible vocal talent like Sarah's (or Mariah Carey's), there's no need to shock people with a willingness to be naked or partially clad.  It detracts from a reputation as serious musical artists.  If I wanted a pin-up girl, I'd subscribe to Playboy.  I'm all about the music!So to the music I'll return, and leave future video collections in the bin until I see better visual images more deserving of Sarah's wonderful talent.NOTE: Instead, check out her concert videos ""La Luna"" and ""Harem.""  They're much more imaginative and entertaining than most of what you'll find in these music videos.  Definitely worth a look!",N/A
358173,"I wanted to share my love of Miyazaki's animated features with my 5-year-old, but I wanted to make sure it would be appropriate for her. ""My Neighbor Totoro"" proved to be delightful and engaging, perfect for a young child.The story is simple and sweet without being overly cloying. A father and his two daughters, Satsuki and Mei move to the countryside whilst their mother recovers from an illness in the hospital. There, the sisters discover that their home is haunted by benign spirits and the younger sister Mei discovers a creature named Totoro which is a forest spirit (he looks like an oversized bunny). Totoro is a sight to behold - his large appearance and loud growls belie a gentle nature, one which is in harmony with Mother Nature. One night, as the sisters wait for their father at the bus-stop, older sister Satsuki finds Totoro standing beside her in the rain. The sisters then witness an unusual sight - a cat which is also a bus, which looks like it was inspired by Lewis Carroll's Cheshire cat!There are no villains in this charming and engaging story, and I found that quite refreshing (why should there be villains in children's stories, they'll learn the harsh realities of life soon enough!).  Even the mother's illness is vague and not a real cause for concern except perhaps in the later part of the story when Mei goes missing trying to find the hospital her mother is in. My daughter could not get enough of Totoro and begged for repeated viewings. She loves the giant, endearing creature and would watch with rapt fascination each time Totoro appeared on screen.I loved the gentle ecological message of being in harmony with nature - Totoro bequests a gift of  seeds to the sisters which they plant in their garden. This is a sweet movie perfect for little ones and also older viewers - a show that can be enjoyed by the entire family.",My Neighbor Totoro VHS

24267,"Olivier and Leigh. The husband and wife team of the 40s. Preceded by Fairbanks and Pickford, contemporary with Gable and Lombard and followed by Taylor and Burton.""Fire Over England"" was the first pairing of Laurence Olivier (1907-1989) and his future wife Vivien Leigh (1913-67). They met in 1935 and began their affair during this film. They made several films together, including ""That Hamilton Woman"" (1941), and toured together many times in performances of ""Anthony and Cleopatra"",  ""MacBeth"", ""Twelfth Night"", and ""The School for Scandal"". They divorced in 1960.Leigh is best known for her stunning performances in ""GWTW"" (1939) as Scarlett O'Hara and as Blanche DuBois in ""A Streetcar Named Desire"" (1951) - she won the Oscar both times. Eventually physical problems, a miscarriage, and the difficulty of living with Olivier would take their toll and she began a slow descent into madness, perhaps precipitated by the 326 performances as DuBois on stage in London followed by  months filming the movie. Between 1955 and 1965 she made only 1 film, but she carried on with her theatre work and even won a Tony in 1963. Her  last film appearance was in 1965 (""Ship of Fools"").Olivier was nominated for an Oscar 10 times, from 1939 (""Wuthering Heights"") to 1978 (""Boys from Brazil""), and won in 1949 for ""Hamlet"". He appeared in 80+ films, usually as an Englishman or in films based in England.  His prime period had been in the 40s, and he made few films in the 50s, probably because of all the personal problems he was having. He appears as #14 on the AFI list of Top 50 Screen Legends.Flora Robson (1902-84) appeared in more than 50 films and was nominated for an Oscar for her role in ""Saratoga Trunk"" (1945). She played Elizabeth in this film and reprised her role for ""The Sea Hawk"" (1940), another Alexander Korda film. Many people believe that she is the definitive Elizabeth, although my preference would be Bette Davis in ""Essex and Elizabeth"" (1939). Other actresses who've played Elizabeth include Glenda Jackson (1971), Helen Mirren (2005), Sarah Bernhardt (1912) and Cate Blanchett (1998, 2007). Actresses who played Elizabeth twice include Robson, Bette Davis (1938, 1955) and Cate Blanchett (1998, 2007).BTW - Robson was only 35 when she appeared in this film. By comparison, Bette Davis was 30 when she first played her and Cate Blancehtt was 29. The film depicts Elizabeth in her mid 50s.Raymond Massey (1896-1983) plays King Philip of Spain. He is best remembered for his roles as Lincoln. He was nominated for an Oscar for playing ""Abe Lincoln in Illinois"" (1940) which remains, to date, the best ever portrayal of Lincoln. He reprised the role on TV in ""The Day Lincoln was Shot"" (1950) and again in ""How the West Was Won"" (1962). On TV he played Dr. Gillespie in the series ""Dr Kildare"" (1961-5). He made nearly 100 films. I remember him best for his over the top portrayal of John Brown in ""Santa Fe Trail"" (1940). Prior to playing Lincoln, most of his roles were villainous (e.g., Citizen Chauvelin in ""The Scarlet Pimpernel"", Black Michael in ""The Prisoner of Zenda"", Prince Ghul in ""The Drum"").The great Robert Newton (1905-56) plays Don Pedro. This was his third of what was to become more than 50 films that included ""Henry V"", ""Oliver Twist"" (1948), ""Les Miserables"" (1952) and my personal favorite, ""Treasure Island"" (1950).James Mason has a tiny role in the beginning of the film. When it was re-released in 1944 and Mason had become a star, Korda commissioned a new trailer that stressed Mason's part.Alexander Korda (1893-1956) produced nearly 60 films in his career that started in 1923 in Hungary. His break through film was ""The Private Life of Henry VIII"" (1933) and there followed a series of historical dramas including ""Rise of Catherine the Great"" (1934), ""Private Life of Don Juan"" (1934), ""The Scarlet Pimpernel"" (1934) and ""Rembrandt"" (1936), of which ""Fire Over England"" is a lesser example. Korda was known for his cheap production values, which are evident in this film.The film was produced in 1937. It has some suggestions that involvement on the continent is dangerous, as later events would prove.This is a fairly standard historical drama of the 30s and mostly forgettable. It is notable as being the film that David Selznick saw which convinced him that Vivien Leigh could play Scarlett. Far better films from this period about the Elizabethan era include ""Private Lives of Elizabeth and Essex"" (1939) and ""The Sea Hawk"" (1940).",N/A

1037477,"I own just about every SWAN LAKE that has ever been released on home video. This is my current favorite.It's not a traditional fairy-tale production. The sets are minimal, dark and suggestive. The story has been cunningly tweaked, merging the roles of Benno, the Tutor and Rothbart into a dark composite character (danced by a severe Karl Pacquette) who jealously seeks to control the Prince. Many interpretations are possible, enhancing the ambiguities of the score.This is the most melancholy flock of white swans imaginable. As Odette, Agnes Letestu combines strong dancing with an almost unbearable sadness and desperation, transforming into an alluring and distinctly feminine Odile. Jos&eacute; Martinez (the Prince) is also a superb dancer and partner, but seems emotionally distant and uninvolved until the very end. Perhaps this is intentional.The ensemble dancing is uniformly excellent, and the character soloists are consistently delightful. The Dance of the Little Swans is a show-stopper.The performance is given with Acts I-II combined. The ""swan"" theme usually played at the end of Act I is omitted, as it's very similar to the version that begins Act II.The wide 16:9 picture is of demonstration quality, razor-sharp and highly detailed, doing full justice to the beautiful costumes and deeply saturated lighting effects. The camera work is mostly unobtrusive and favors wide views, making the few closeups even more effective. Blu-ray brutally reveals the sweat on the dancers. These people sure work hard.The BEST part of this disc is the soundtrack. It is no exaggeration to say that it's worth buying even if you turn off the picture!In addition to my video collection, I own about three dozen vinyl and CD recordings of SWAN LAKE. This performance/recording blows nearly all of them away. Except for Dorati '54 (which is monaural), I have never heard a better sense of musical proportion and orchestral balance applied to this repertoire. The dynamics and rubato have a ""just right"" feeling that makes me smile with satisfaction. Tempos are thoughtful, often slower than usual, bringing out details in the arrangement that are easy to miss. Nearly all repeats are observed. The 5.1 surround recording is vivid and transparent, with a front soundstage that is impressively wide and deep. Even without headphones, you can pinpoint every instrumental group in space. The solo violin is RIGHT THERE. Stage noise is minimal. Only the applause keeps this from being a perfect reference recording; but you can hardly blame the audience for its enthusiasm!Speaking as a certified SWAN LAKE junkie, this disc earns the highest recommendation.",N/A
1364256,"Shortly into ""Vampires Suck,"" someone puts a Kick Me sign on the heroine's back.  The ""Twilight"" series is (at least in my opinion) so easy to parody it practically has a Kick Me sign of its own.  But this movie fails to take advantage of all the opportunities, though it hits about half.  Sometimes it makes you chuckle; other times - and there are a lot - you just roll your eyes.Back in the nineties, Alanis Morrisette had a hit called ""Isn't It Ironic.""  What was ironic was that she didn't seem to have a firm grasp of the term.  (Irony is not the same as bad luck.)  Neither do the scriptwriters of this movie.  Merely pointing out that you're being ironic is not enough to be a joke.  In other words, if you're a sourpuss whom hotties inexplicably find attractive, stating this isn't funny in itself.  It reminded me of ""Not Another Teen Movie,"" where characters kept saying things like, ""I'm the Token Black Guy.""  Similarly, this movie has characters pointing out that staring at someone in slo-mo is a sign of true love.  If that's enough to make you laugh, you'll like this movie.But wait.  There's more.  Throw in a generous helping of gross-out gags and add a smorgasbord of pop culture references, most of them random (the Kardashians, Gossip Girl, Twitter, etc), and add some dance numbers to the mix, season with some homophobic jokes, and there you go.  The good news is that it's pretty short, and the leads all do a great job, especially Jenn Proske, who has Kristen Stewart's lip biting and pensive pouting down cold, so it's not a complete disaster.  But close.I have to say this is a better movie than ""Epic Movie,"" and ""Date Movie,"" made by the same team.  If you're familiar with those two movies, you know this isn't much of a compliment.  But these parody movies are getting a bit better. Just not that fast.",N/A
279768,"Two incompetent vampire hunters, Professor Abronsius (Jack MacGowran of ""Doctor Zhivago"") and his bumbling assistant Alfred (Roman Polanski of ""Rush Hour 3"") venture to a remote village in Eastern Europe so they can substantiate the existence of vampires. ""The Fearless Vampire Killers or Pardon Me But Your Teeth are in my Neck"" is a spoof of vampire chillers in general and specifically Hammer horror movies. Mind you, this qualifies as a traditional vampire movie. The vampires have fangs, cast no reflection in mirrors, and spend their days in their coffins. Although the film generated a lot of coin in Europe, it flopped in America and MGM didn't help matters when they re-edited it so drastically that director Roman Polanski disowned it. Polanski penned the screenplay with his Repulsion collaborator G&eacute;rard Brach. Wilfrid Shingleton's production designs are first-rate. Nevertheless, Polanski and his collaborators scare up a lot of atmosphere in this 107 minute film. ""Blue Max"" lenser Douglas Slocombe's widescreen cinematography contributes to the air of suspense that Polanski generates. ""The Fearless Vampire Killers"" is one of those rare films that you could watch in the dead of an incandescent summer and contract chills from its winter-covered surroundings.The narrator sets the ominous but amusing tone of this sophisticated parody: ""That night, penetrating deep into the heart of Transylvania, Professor Abronsius was unaware that he was on the point of reaching the goal of his mysterious investigations. In the course of which he had journeyed throughout Central Europe for years accompanied by his one and only faithful disciple, Alfred. A scholar and scientist whose genius was unappreciated, Abronsius had given up all to devote himself body and soul to what was to him a sacred mission. He had even lost his chair at K&ouml;nigsberg University, where for a long time his colleagues used to refer to him as ""The Nut."" Along the way, angry dogs attack our hapless heroes, and the elderly, white-haired professor arrives at an inn frozen to the bone. Jewish innkeeper Shagal (Alfie Bass of ""Alfie"") thaws out the professor after everybody chimes in with a remedy to thaw him out. The first thing that Abronsius notices is string of garlic dangling from the ceiling. As far as he is concerned, Abronsius has found vampires and he plans to stay. When Shagal shows Abronsius and Alfred to their room, he forgets that his bodacious, red-haired daughter Sarah (Sharon Tate) is luxuriating in their bathtub. He promises Abronsius and Alfred that they will have use of the bathroom tomorrow. Shagal whips his daughter for constantly using the tub to bathe in, and she informs Alfred later that she got into the habit of washing regularly in school.Naturally, when Abronsius inquires, Shagal and his townsfolk dismiss vampires as nothing more than superstitious shenanigans. Later, the professor spots a hunchback, Koukol (Terry Downes of ""A Study in Terror""), and sends Alfred off to follow the deformed fellow. Alfred doesn't get far, especially after the hunchback appears to dine on dog. At the inn, Shagal likes to slip out of bed late at night and sneak up to bundle up with Magda, the Maid (Fiona Lewis of ""Otley""), but Shagal's wife Rebecca (Jessie Robins of ""Billy Liar"") has her suspicions. She tries to catch him in the act, but clobbers the inquisitive Abronsius by mistake. He never learns who struck. Ironically, Shagal manages to conceal himself and his vast bulk behind the door in Magda's room. Sarah pays the price of bathing one time too often, and she is cavorting in bubbles when the skylight opens and Count von Krolock (Ferdy Mayne of ""Where Eagles Dare"") descends, in his regal Bela Lugosi cloak, and takes a bite out of her beautiful throat. Shagal goes off to avenge Sarah and comes back dead and drained. Meanwhile, Alfred has become infatuated with Sarah, and Abronsius and he set off for the Count's castle to rescue her. When they blunder into the castle, the vampire patriarch awaits them and has rooms prepared for them.You can tell that this vampire spoof is different when a nubile young lady tries to ward off a thirsty vampire with a crucifix and the vampire dismisses her efforts with a chuckle because he is Jewish: ""Oy, hev you got the wrong vampire!"" The ironic ending is a big plus, too.",N/A

1046956,"Five Fingers of Death (original title translation: King Boxer) was the very first Hong Kong-made martial arts film released in the US, and by a major studio (Warner Brothers) no less. This was America's jaw dropping first look at a Chinese action movie and, for that historical reason alone, is probably worth a viewing by anyone interested in the genre. Hong Kong films had become popular with audiences throughout Southeast Asia and in the third world but, as low budget and corny as they are, weren't initially intended for the more sophisticated moviegoers of the west. Why Warners decided to distribute FFD (other than the likelihood it was cheap to pick up) is puzzling.  And this was many months before Bruce Lee brought a star presence to the genre.FFD establishes the now-traditional touchstones of the kung fu movie: the elaborately (and obviously) choreographed fight scenes, the rival martial arts schools, the tournament to the death, anti-Japanese sentiment, the virtuous young kung fu master, the special kung fu style and its unique training method; they're all here. (I recently watched ""Ip Man"", an excellent newer film that features all of these too.) FFD comes with a modern musical score that is entirely out of step with its pre-modern sets and costumes. Bizarrely, it works.For Hong Kong action fans, this is also a rare chance to see the late Lo Lieh, always the heavy in subsequent movies, as the film's hero. Another plus: the fights were choreographed by Liu Chia Liang, a bone fide kung fu master who went on to become one of the genre's best actors and directors.Also, this is the ONLY kung fu film that I recommend watching in its English dubbed version with the actors appearing to speak out of sync with the soundtrack like slack jawed marionettes. This is an integral part of the FFD experience.Sit back, check out those glowing red iron palms and see how it all started.",N/A
1338432,"""Superman/Batman: Apocalypse"" really benefits from the use of Kevin Conroy, Tim Daly, Susan Eisenberg, and Ed Asner, voicing the characters that they did so well in the Batman, Superman, and Justice League series.  The story is pretty good, ""introducing"" Supergirl to the fold, with the young Kryptonian discovering who she is and how she fits into the scheme of things.Andre Braugher makes a decent Darkseid but after having become accustomed to Michael Ironside in the part, it's a little disconcerting to hear Braugher in the role.Great animation adds to the enjoyment of the film, with the characters not quite as ""overdrawn"" as in ""Public Enemies."" The fight scenes are well-developed, with the best one being a ""surprise"" near the film's conclusion.Of the other direct-to-video animated films that Warner has produced since the demise of Justice League, this is the one that is more like a continuation of the series.The extras on the DVD are excellent, especially the inclusion of the two-part ""Little Girl Lost"" with Nicholle Tom as Kara/Supergirl and it marks the first time that Asner voices ""Granny Goodness.""

1264825,"""A Serious Man""  is an original.  Directed by Joel and Ethan Coen (""No Country for Old Men""), the film focuses on an Everyman named Larry Gopnik (Michael Stuhlbarg), a physics professor at a Midwestern university where he will soon learn if he will receive tenure.  The year is 1967, and Larry is in for some unexpected troubles.  His wife (Sari Lennick) is leaving him for best friend Sy Ableman (Fred Melamed).  His unemployed brother (Richard Kind) is becoming more and more of a burden.  His son, Danny (Aaron Wolff), is secretly listening to rock music at Hebrew school rather than learning the Torah.  The alluring woman next door sunbathes nude.  Larry elicits sympathy because he is a decent guy bombarded by a series of incidents that lead him to wonder why God has singled him out for ""tsouris.""  Distraught, he consults three different rabbis, who lead him on a convoluted journey as he struggles to make sense of it all.There are many Coen trademarks here:  emphasis on the grotesque, dry humor, ominous low-angle cinematography, situations bordering on the surreal, and bizarre dream/nightmare sequences.  The Coens tell their story episodically, offering perhaps a few too many tangential subplots.  When we think we've latched onto the main thread, focus shifts, and then shifts again.  The film is like a homemade chicken soup where the individual ingredients haven't quite blended.Performances are uniformly low-key as characters create comedy in subtle ways.  There are no jokes, but we laugh at the earnest characters, the absurd situations, and the skewering of established religion.  ""A Serious Man"" is the anti-sitcom.  It showcases a family with its warts and flaws right out front.  Ozzie and Harriet never worried about the meaning of life or why a dark cloud settled over the family.  The Coens revel in dissecting Larry's angst as we watch his awkward, humorous missteps through life, relationships, and morality.  The ending is rather abrupt, and might require a replay to understand how everything comes together.Blu-ray and DVD extras include the featurettes ""Becoming Serious,"" which explores the creative vision behind ""A Serious Man;"" ""Creating 1967,"" a tour of the Minneapolis neighborhoods used in the movie; and ""Hebrew and Yiddish for Goys,"" a guide through the mysteries of the Hebrew and Yiddish languages.",A Serious Man

115344,"""Diner"" is one of those pictures that has a bunch of unknown performers who would go on to achieve fame in show business.  There is Mickey Rourke, Ellen Barkin, Steve Guttenberg, Kevin Bacon, Daniel Stern, and Paul Reiser.  All of them relatively unknown at the time ""Diner"" was released.The story is a coming-of-age tale about six long-time buddies who are at that tricky stage in their lives when they must go from carefree youths to responsibility-laden adults.  The story is set in Baltimore, Maryland around 1960 and sports ... in particular the Baltimore Colts of the NFL ... play a big part in the film.  The boys meet regularly ... late at night ... at the local diner ... as they have for years, and the diner is sort-of the focal point of the movie.Eddie (Steve Guttenberg) is getting married, and the movie goes along with that wedding as its conclusion, but there are many adolescent-type adventures (and troubles) along the way, and we, the audience, are treated to a lot of laughs (""He punched out the wise men."")If you wonder who ... of these future stars ... does the best job acting, it is not, as you might think, Mickey Rourke.  Mickey does good ""Look at me."" work, but for the purists who appreciate true-to-life acting, the winner here is ... Daniel Stern.  He outclasses his distinguished colleagues in the subtleness of his performace and the depth and thoroughness of his characterization.  I love these types of performances.  Kevin bacon is good too as Timothy ... the borderline psycho.  Ellen Barkin is very good, but, for some reason, she always gives me the creeps.  Steve Guttenberg, oddly, gets top billing in the movie.  But even the small parts are filled with quality performances.But ""Diner"" is mostly a guy movie, though it is enjoyable for everyone.  It doesn't make any earth-shaking statements, and it I doubt it's on many critics best ten list, but it touches something deep in us and is perhaps a classic in and of itself.",Diner VHS
1184365,"I grew up watching this classic TV series; it became my immediate favorite. So when word got out in 2007 that it was finally FINALLY coming to DVD, I jumped at the chance to own it. I must say, kudos to HBO Video for lovingly packaging Get Smart, from its groovy 60's-flavored design to the crisp DVD transfer to all the rare bonus goodies included. Certain episodes stick out in memory (""One of Our Olives is Missing"", ""To Sire with Love, parts I & II"", ""Only Two 99"", etc.). But it was great to get reacquainted with them all, from start (""Mr. Big"", the only GS episode in black & white) to finish (""I Am Curiously Yellow"", in which Larrabee gets the last laugh). GS was such a perfect showcase for the comedic genius of Don Adams, who coined such great catchphrases throughout that are well remembered today. And let's not forget the wonderful chemistry he had with great supporting players Barbara Feldon & Edward Platt. Revisiting GS, it's a no-brainer that it was created by Mel Brooks & Buck Henry. Particularly by Brooks, as the series benefited from his zany logic (who would've dreamed up shoe phones or other daffy CONTROL gadgets??). Other characters, such as the strangely dense Larrabee (Adams' real life cousin Robert Karavelas), Hymie the Robot (Dick Gautier was terrific in the role), and KAOS nemesis Siegfried (a brilliantly manic Bernie Kopell) are but a few who helped populate the wacky spy world of GS.Great series, great presentation & great memories!

417158,"A returning Vietnam Vet approaches mental collapse as he tries to readjust to a jobless post-war America. He is faced with haunting memories, squalid living conditions, a nagging wife, and extreme poverty, when he finds it impossible to keep it together. Like Bob Clark's DEATHDREAM, COMBAT SHOCK is a biting critical response to the way America discarded its Veterans following the withdrawal from Vietnam. While the production values and acting may not be as polished or professional as Clark's film, the dark tone and disturbing realism have an immediate impact on the viewer. Giovinazzo's gritty filming and dilapidated cityscape are both reflective of Frankie's debilitating mental state, creating an external mirror to his inner anguish. It is impossible to avoid making comparisons to THE DEER HUNTER or TAXI DRIVER, since the film draws heavy influence from both, but it still manages to establish its own unique voice through Frankie's depressing performance. The horrors depicted in COMBAT SHOCK are inescapable. It is a brutal portrayal of one of America's darkest moments in history, and it is as shocking as the title entails.-Carl ManesI Like Horror Movies",Combat Shock VHS

1149135,"4.4 starsI enjoyed this more than the second season, mainly due to the entire arc with Smits. He works well with Hall and some of their scenes together are excellent. But as before, I find the side plots with the other actors less and less compelling.Carpenter just doesn't impress me much; she could easily be in any other boring typical cop show out there, ditto for most everyone here except Hall, who continues to carry the series along with the very good writing. Angel seems to be the only one here truly progressing as an actor, and his scenes are the pick of the non-Dexter litter.I must say, however, that this was the season where I finally realized how sick this series and my/our love of it is. Seriously, folks. How mentally ill and numbed to violence are we now that we can watch the increasingly graphic murders on this show and be entertained by them?It hit me when Dexter is with Prado as he murders his first victim in the kill room. Whereas in the first season we got mostly visual suggestions of the brutality, in a much more artistic and Hitchcockian way, now the producers are making straight out snuff films. Watch the camera when Prado stabs the guy; it shows the knife go right in to the hilt, then it show Prado's almost orgasmic glee in murdering this guy, and then it pans to Dexter's grim smile, as if to say, isn't it fun to kill people?I had a sudden queasy feeling when I saw that, and it hit me pretty clearly how sick I and we have become when our weekly entertainment is watching carefully-made pictures of the joy that a murderer feels. The moral compass of this show seems to mirror our own capacity for ever more brutality; the more you get the more you want.Just like pornography. That is in fact what this show is becoming: death porn. In their desire to show the inner workings of a killer, they have realized that this format will let them make weekly snuff films, however blase, and each season they are stepping up the intensity of the graphic murders. The ratings are just rocketing, though, so all must be well.And we sit back and eat popcorn and smile as people are carefully disemboweled on screen. Is this not sick? I think it is, but just like the boiling frogs we have been lowered into this cauldron slowly over the decades until we accept that this is entertainment. At this rate, how long until we broadcast capital punishment via pay-per-view? Or simply stop caring that as a nation we have become inured and numb to murder and torture?Speaking of which, isn't it time for our greatest killer, Dick Chainysaw, to appear on this show and kill some folks along with our hero Dex? How awesome that would be. ""They deserve it, Dexter. We are Good, and they are Bad. This is Justice.""And of course, I will now get comments from the (always bravely anonymous) fanboys about how this is just a tv show, and don't be such a wimp. Yet I find it more than coincidental that as tv gets sicker and sicker, we are increasingly unconcerned by our government killing and torturing people, all in the name of Justice.In the end, that's what lets them get away with this show: Dexter is killing bad people! They deserve to die! And we want to see them killed as slowly and brutally as possible.So who's really sick? Maybe it's we as a nation that need to be laid out and tied down on Dexter's killing table, with pictures of the millions of innocent people our tax dollars have killed while we look the other way, from Cambodian carpet bombings to Langley-remote-controlled drones that may be murdering yet more innocent Pakistanis this very moment.And then Dexter will say, ""It was never enough, was it? You needed ever more resources, ever more markets, so you could live your detached, pseudo-comfortable lives free from thinking about how many innocent people died to create that fake world of Fake comfort. All so you could sit in your living rooms and watch tv shows about how murder is really not so bad...as long as you kill the right people.""But hey, I'm just kidding.Let's just relax, and be entertained.",Dexter: Season 3

1312664,"There is a subset of the comedy action genre that needs to be dubbed the pure popcorn adventure. This is the film that has no real substance, a great big budget and likable stars that we are pleased to simply sit through and then forget about as soon as the film ends. Disney's The Sorceror's Apprentice is one of these films, It is the Disney entry in the every major studio feels the need to make a Harry Potter like fim before its too late to do so trend. Does this make the film a bad one? Not really. The film is watchable for its entire length its just not something that you will remember within a few days of seeing it.Nicholas Cage plays Balthazar Blake a contemporary of Merlin who is charged with finding a sorceror who can prevent the Rising. The Rising is an event that will occur if Morgana Le Fay is allowed to be reincarnated or released from a grimhold nested doll that she was trapped in. The Rising will lead to the end of the world as we know it and surely enough special effects to use the estimated 150M that this film cost to make.Enter the picture Dave (Jay Beruchel) a nerdy twenty something that Balthazar is convinced is the prime Merliner. The Prime Merliner is is the only wizard powerful enough to head of the coming of the Rising that has been put into place by Balthazar's rival Maxim Horvath (Alfred Molina). The film than procedes to show us the training of the future wizard.All of this confusing plot simply serves as a gateway for the film's special effects. There are huge set pieces involving car chases, flying statues, tesla coils and a remake of the famous mop scene from Fantasia. Add to this romance with the most beautiful girl in town Becky Barnes (Theresa Palmer) and we have what Disney would have predicted to be a huge hit. What Disney got in reality was an ok film that never really found its audience.This is not a bad way to spend the evening and if the popcorn is hot can be quite fun.

1146498,"Be it true or not, the story is funny. A rather impoverished student at MIT decides to accept a proposal to make some easy money, since he is good at numbers, by playing Black Jack in Las Vegas. That student will get the scholarship he needs to go to Harvard medical school that costs 300,000 US dollars. He is dragged into the black jack business by some math teacher who is using a group of students to make easy money (he gets 50% of the winnings) without being seen because he is persona non grata at all and forever in Las Vegas, though they do not know his face. That professor is of course a crook and when one night, unsettled by some riff raff with his best friends, our student, Ben, loses a lot, the professor destroys everything: he blocks him at MIT, he visits his room and steals his money that was hidden in the false ceiling, ruining at the same time his dream of Harvard, he even tells the security people that the student is back at the black jack table. But the student gets his revenge on the professor, the hard way, but he had to deal with the security boss in the casino who cheats him in his turn and he is still without any money left. But that really dazzles the Dean of Harvard Medical School who interviews him a second time: he went to Las Vegas 17 times, won the 300,000 dollars twice and they were stolen from him twice too. Apparently that is a dazzling life experience that deserves a scholarship. That film is immoral, wicked, perverted, and that student is going to be a doctor. I just hope he does not gamble with the life of his patients the same way. And yet it is fascinating because it demonstrates some people are ready to do absolutely anything to satisfy their desires, to reach their goals, to succeed, no matter what it may be. At the same time some are ready to betray anyone to get even or get revenge or just to get a profit out of these others. But are you sure you would not do that too? You can't imagine what some very decent people were able and ready to do in Nazi concentration camps just to be a Kapo, which meant they had a chance to survive longer. In some situation you cannot know what you would do. Anyway, to defeat casinos on their own ground is absolutely funny for us the spectators and must be absolutely funny for the ""gambler"" even if he has to be good with figures, which means slightly autistic, which means slightly retarded.

68447,"It is 6 PM in Toronto, precisely six hours before the end of the world. The reason for the end is never specified. Perhaps the sun will go nova. Perhaps a vagrant neutron star has wandered into the solar system and is headed for earth. The sky never turns dark during those six hours, which is as much of a clue as we get. It doesn't matter. What matters is that everyone in the world has known about the end for months, there is nothing anyone can do to prevent it, and this is the last night.The people in the movie act as we all do all the time, only more intensely. In order to cope, some ignore the reality, some seek family, some seek solitude, some turn to religion, some turn to drugs, some engage in pillage and rapine, some lose themselves in work, some party, and some plan suicide. One character tries to fulfill every sexual fantasy before the end. Another runs nonstop around Toronto. One stays at work and makes thank-you calls to customers. Their reactions all make a kind of sense. In truth, we all face last night even if we don't know the precise second of its arrival, and we all behave in one or more of these various ways. Six hours, six years, or six decades are just a blink of an eye in the scheme of things after all.The script is full of low-key dark humor. One cranky woman, for example, when someone says ""it's is hard on the children,"" complains, ""I don't give a damn. People are always saying 'The children. Pity the children'. I'm tired of the children. They haven't lived, given birth, watch their friends die. I have invested 80 years in this life. The children don't know what they're missing.""

In this futuristic movie called "" 2012 "" the end of the world as we know it should end on this date. Well except for the date, little if anything went wrong with the movie. Watching the film within the surround sound system of a Cina-Plex theater, the entire movie was an exciting, fantastic thrill-ride on steroids and had me on the edge of my seat the entire time. The acting, the assembled cast, the wonderful CGI-effects, the volcanic explosions, the crumbling earth, toppling buildings, world wide catastrophic flooding and doomsday happenings made this incredible movie a monumental visual success. The story as we see it has John Cusack playing writer Jackson Curtis, who predicted the world's end in a book entitle 'Farewell Atlantis.' Chiwetel Ejiofor plays Adrian Helmsley a scientific adviser to the president who having read the book has concluded the government should listen to him. Oliver Platt is Carl Anheuser, the Political adviser to the president and is superb in that role. Woody Harrelson plays Charlie Frost a radio host and doomsday prophet. Danny Glover is President Thomas Wilson who believes mankind waited too long to hear the truth. John Billingsley is wonderfully serious as Professor West. With a supreme effort in direction, this movie will easily become a Sci-Fi award winner. The special effects will also make this an all time Classic and a milestone for John Heard in his career.

158071,"Thank you producer Gary Kurtz, writers Leigh Brackett and Lawrence Kasdan, director Irvin Kershner. And Stuart Freeborn and Frank Oz for Yoda. Also much appreciation goes to actor Harrison Ford for changing his line from what Lucas wrote and therefor making what would have been a corny, poorly written scene into one of the classic moments of the entire saga.The story behind the greatest Star Wars film is incredible to me.This is excerpted from wikipedia (because I'm feelin' lazy as Lucas in writing here):""During filming of The Empire Strikes Back George Lucas suffered an apparent panic attack, accusing the filmmakers of ruining his movie. He followed this by taking the existing footage into an editing bay and cut together a fast-paced action version of early scenes, excising plot-oriented content, then showed it to Kurtz and other members of cast and crew, who reacted with laughter. Lucas later admitted this was a mistake(.....)Even after the financial success of The Empire Strikes Back, Lucas regarded The Empire Strikes Back as a failure. It was after this pronouncement that Kurtz and Lucas parted company.It is notable that the more mystical aspects of the Jedi were absent from Star Wars films following Kurtz's departure, while similar mystical elements appeared in Kurtz's later muppet fantasy film The Dark Crystal. Lucas' replacement of mystical or spiritual explanations with more scientific-seeming explanations such as midichlorians in the Star Wars prequels has faced heavy criticism from Star Wars fans.""""A failure"", said George Lucas of The Empire Strikes Back. The undisputed fan favorite and favorite of film critics is a failure to George Lucas and his least favorite Star Wars film.This shouldn't surprise anyone either:""After Raiders of the Lost Ark in 1981, Lucas became convinced that audiences no longer cared about the story; they were simply there for thrills and entertainment, and he began to deviate from the original nine-episode bible starting with Return of the Jedi, at which point Kurtz quit the series"".",Star Wars Trilogy THX Digitally Mastered Edition

The sets are good, the costumes and make up excellent, there's really nothing that takes your attention away from the movie being presented by screaming ""fake"" at you when you're just getting engrossed.Queen of the Damned likewise shares the good points from Gothica while being a vampire based movie. The story here is very far fetched but spun in such a way as to be totally engrossing within the frame presented.Dreamcatcher has a more oblique storyline decent directing and average acting. It's very much a different take on the genere, but one which I thoroughly enjoyed and having watched it I'm surprised it didn't do a little better at the box office.Ghost Ship was the better storyline, but was let down in some other respects, though it had an interesting twist at the finale.

1276963,"Tony Scott returns once more to the action movie, and does the sort of slick production job we have come to expect from him, with trusty stalwart Denzel Washington along for the ride.  Though one has to say, that this time, he's not really on top form - we are well short of `Man on Fire' territory here.This remake of the 70's classic has the same circumstances unfolding but with a slightly different slant - taking away much of the cold and calculating side to the villain, and imbuing the Washington character with some backstory.  (He's under investigation, it turns out).  So, we still have a subway train hijacked, this time by a tattooed and heckling Travolta.  Washington plays the subway employee who happens to be the dispatcher when it all goes down, and his character works best while cooped up with only a microphone to liaise with the hijacker.  Sadly he fails to convince as readily when he is out on the street and in the subway to face off directly with Travolta's character.  John Turturro and James Gandolfini round out the supporting cast.The action, such as it is, is adequate enough, but never quite wrings tension in the way you feel it ought to.  In particular, one extended runaway train sequence never quite develops a sense of genuine threat , and the resolution to the scene never has the sense of relief / release it seems was intended.  The character development feels particularly broad stroked, lacking the sort of minor detail that convinces us enough to invest our emotions in the movie.  Washington's recent history feels shoehorned in rather than coming organically from the story, and when he starts playing the reluctant action hero, we are left chuckling at how unlikely it is, rather than feeling he is truly caught up in the drama.  As for Travolta, one is inclined to think he should just stop playing bad guys.. his character feels like an over the top panto villain, with a few lines of expositionary dialogue squeezed in to the script in an attempt to give him depth.  It doesn't work.  And then finally, in stark contrast to the original, the ending is all too predictable.So while the end result is a passable action movie with some genuine starpower, the bottom line is that those yearning for the intelligence and sticky tense atmosphere of the original will be disappointed, as will those expecting a bangs and bullets modern `Tony Scott' action movie.  It's a movie which is less than the sum of its parts - but the parts are still good enough to come through the muddle worth a couple of hours of your time, thanks in large part to a few dry comedic moments thrown in... as well as a few unintentional laughs along the way.",N/A

Its a truly instant turn on look from a male point of view.My rating here is compared to other media of its type. Its certainly not a 4 compared to mainstream films. Compared to other soft core erotica, however, its excellent work.",Sexual Intrigue

935334,"In the last 10 minutes of the film,I am sure many people are like me trying to figure out where the seamstress is.Her name is not on one of paper boats so she is not dead;she is not married to the dentist.It is very clever of the writer.Finally,we heard rumors that she went to Shenzhen and Hong Kong.A beautiful yet uneducated peasant girl more than likely ends up as prostitute or mistress of rich men in metropolis.It is ""My fair lady"" with a twist.She said she was inspired by Balzac.Does it mean books are dangerous,causing people to run away from home,justifying the Communist line? I don't think so.She is an innocent peasant susceptible to all sorts of influence,just like the village chief who blindly lives his life according to Mao's red book without questioning.They lack analytical thinking,unlike Ma and Luo.Also,she has a wild streak.Remember she was the one who suggested stealing the books.She has always wondered about what it is like outside the village.She would look up at the airplanes flying by.The 2 intellectuals have so impressed her that she decided to go away to have a look.But by herself.When she had abortion,Luo was not there,this must have been devastating for her,perhaps making her decide to leave alone?Or maybe she thought she might get into trouble with the authorities if she let Luo follows.Or maybe she thought people like Luo and Ma are a dime a dozen outside the village.Or perhaps she thought if she ended up with one,the other would be devastated. It is also ""Jules et Jim"" with a twist.This is the beauty of the movie.Life is mysterious.If it were a soap-opera,Luo would get rehabilitated and they would get married and have 2 kids.Four Eyes,unlike Luo and Ma,is an intellectual without integrity.He is an opportunist,a conformist,trying too hard to please the power that be,only to be whipped by the ox,an animal he proclaimed proudly to have tamed in front of the Re-education Committee,almost losing his glasses if not for Luo and Ma and the blood of which he drank and got diarrhea.Little seamstress hates him. Whereas when the highly-respected old tailor wanted to teach Luo all he knew about sewing on the condition that the latter give up reading ""dangerous"" books,Luo refused,saying ""I am too clumsy"".In the 80s and 90s,China was embracing capitalism and she misinterpreted Balzac's""Beauty is priceless"".Love got her a painful abortion.She had tasted her precious first love.Subsequent lovers would not mean that much.Why not become a material girl,she might have thought.I try to read her mind but I might be wrong.And I haven't read the book which might give more insights.She said that fake snow was better than real snow and movies recounted were better than movies watched.Movies are already digests of reality so a digest of a digest is even better!This enters the realm of post-modern art theory.Does it lead her to think that fake love for sale is better?This movie can be compared with ""Life is beautiful"".Both look at tragedy from a lighter angle.It is with a light heart that people survive.The violinist cried in the doctor's office not for the seamstress but for Fou Lei,the translator of the piece the doctor was reading.The movie did not mention this but Fou Lei and his wife  could not stand the persecution and committed suicide.They are not fictional characters.Their son is the famous Chopin expert Fou Tseng.I don't give it 5 star because it smacks a little bit of elitism.Knowledge is important in a dangerous world but it is no match for crass capitalism.Some humor was lost in the translation.Ma was telling the story of ""Count of Monte Cristo"" to the old tailor when the village chief eavesdropped.""Count of Monte Cristo""in Chinese is ""Ji Du Shan Bo Jue"".But the village chief thought he was talking about Jesus because he misheard""Ji Du Sheng Bai Jiao"" which means ""Jesus Christ grows a hundred legs""!Religion was strictly forbidden in that era so Ma got into trouble.The old tailor asked,""Why don't you talk about old Chinese classics"" and Ma said,""The story takes place faraway,if you don't like it,I won't tell you."" This is the DARKEST part of Chinese history and the director/writer manages to find lighter and funny moments and the protagonists turned the table around,like in the movie ""The Servant"".If you understand what went on during the Cultural Revolution,you would appreciate this movie more.Ma needed to look like a peasant in the hospital and wore a funny white furry vest.I am pleasantly surprised that people without much knowledge of that period still enjoy the movie.Maybe it works on many levels!!A love triangle in a tumultuous time,etc.To all the young people who comes to Amazon.com,stay in school or go back to school,you never know when knowledge comes in handy.One of my goals is to go to the Western poor part of China to help the students who have to walk across mountain to attend schools everyday and some of them die of carbon monoxide poisoning in winter when the school burns coal to keep warm.We take freedom of information for granted in the west.Do you know that when Gutengurg invented printing press,rulers were afraid of it and made laws to limit its use i.e censorship.Only those people belonging to an organization can be printers.Only in London,Cambridge and Oxford can print shops be set up and the books had to be approved by bishops.Henry VIII banned foreign books.An average joe printed a pamphlet had his hands cut off in public.This is just like what the old tailor said.""My grand-daughter has changed(by books)"".This frightens me,making ""my hands tremble"".""Books can change a person"".""Don't read,books are lies,do something practical such as sew clothes.I can teach you!""There are clips of interviews of the actors who play Ma and Luo and the actress who plays the little seamstress on Youtube.It is in Mandarin Chinese with French subtitles.For those who don't speak these language,I'll translate the gist.The actor who played Luo said that Luo's love for little seamstress is a rebellion against traditional feudal values because she is a simple peasant who is beneath an intellectual.(I thought it was Mao's intent to subvert feudalism too) Anyway,this may explain why Four eyes would rather hang around with his mom than a beautiful woman.Also,he said that literature is a bridge through which Luo touches her heart.This I agree.",N/A

1217624,"The Oct/08 film Max Payne sees yet another in a long line of video game-to-movie releases.However unlike some of its' predecessors this one does not come even close to the excitement,intensity and depth of the game it is based on.The plot is as see through as cellophane and as shallow as a baby's' bath water.The film opens as Max(Mark Wahlberg)is swimming for his life in freezing water and near death.The movie back flashes to a week before and we retrace the steps which led to this moment.We find Max working in a cold case file room at a police station somewhere in NYC.He lost his wife and baby three years before in a brutal murder mystery that he has been trying to solve ever since. Following a hunch he goes to an old snitches' apartment where there is a ""party"" taking place.There he meets Natasha(Olga Kunylenko)who takes a liking to him.Her sister is Mona Sax(Mila Kunis) and she is there with her gang;Russians of whom she is the leader.Mona tries to stop her sister from carrying on but is assuaged by Natasha who leaves with Max.Max takes her back to his apartment but she leaves shortly thereafter when he spurns her advances.On the way back home she is killed.The next day Max's ex partner takes him to the crime scene and reveals his wallet was found near the body.Max explains that she stole it but circumstances don't look good.They part on bad terms but later his old partner phones him with information that might be the key to the mystery of his wifes' death.Max finds him dead at his home,where a struggle ensues and Max blacks out.He wakes up to find an old friend of his father,BB Hensley(Beau Bridges),by his bedside in the hospital.BB is now head of security of the Aesir Corporation;the same company his wife worked for.Max continues his quest and finds some of the evidence his ex partner left behind and it is the tattoos of wings that are on the murder victims which correspond to the wings logo on all Aesir documents.BB fears for Max but can do nothing to stop him.He next interrogates an Aesir employee who finally spills the beans on what happened to his late wife and baby.As he escorts him out his office the witness is killed and Max barely escapes with his life.He takes the evidence to Natasha's sister Mona.It seems the Aesir Corp.has been illegally manufacturing and selling a drug called Valkyr(val-keer)that comes in a small vile.It had been originally designed for military troops but the drugs' terrible side effects forced the company to(officially)withdraw it from production. The company has been using an ex marine,Sgt Jack Lupino,as their pusher,but he has gotten way out of control.Mona tells Max where he can find Lupino which takes him to a local club called Ragnarock.When Max finally confronts Lupino BB ""happens ""upon the scene and saves his life by killing Lupino.We next find Max and BB down by the harbour which BB intends to throw him into with viles of Valkyr on him to make it look like a drug killing.After a short struggle Max gets free but his only option is to jump into the icy cold harbour.This  is where we came in.Max barely makes it out alive and the only thing that saves him from hypothermia are the viles of Valkyr he ingests.He heads straight for the Aesir tower to get BB and ends up cornering him on the roof helio-pad.There he shoots BB dead and the movie ends as the sun comes up on another day.There are many direct and indirect references in the film to the game such as the subway station called Roscoe Street,which the film gets to a ways in.This is where the game itself pretty much starts as Max tells us(in the game)""Death was in the air at Roscoe Street"".Then there is the look of the film which matches the game quite well;the constant snow falling.The Aesir Corp.,is pronounced ""Acer"" in the game but starngely two ways in the film,""Acer"" and ""A-seer"".The final line from the film matches that of the game:""I don't know about heaven,but I believe in angels"".However many of the characters names,ethnicities and importance in plot have been changed around,sometimes more than others.The game sees Max go from one clue to the next which leads to the final battle at Aesir plaza and the taking down of the person responsible for it all;the president of the company a Ms Horne,as he blows up her helicopter as she flees.In the film Ms Horne is more of a shadowy figure who just pulls the strings with the ultimate fight going between Max and his old fathers friend BB;with the helio-pad as just a point of reference.The Russians in the game have far more of a presence but are not headed by Mona.Mona in the game is just a colleague of Max's.Throughout the film we are given the impression that the cops suspect Max himself but they never fire on him.In the game Max is pursued and shot at not only by the bad guys but the NYPD all the way through to the end.Lastly while Jim Bravura in the game is a white stereotypical NYPD cop who appears on TV newcasts and is constantly dogging the heels of Max,in the film they have turned him black and he is now just an ineffectual internal investigator played like a piece of cardboard by rapper Ludicris.The characters and action are all shallow and cartoonish such as when Max gets shot twice and both times there is no further reference to them and he just keeps going.Or when Max,for some reason,heads down an alley and ends up at the end of it walking backwards and getting a gun pointed at his head from around a corner.It is such a bone head move one wishes one had game control of him,because YOU wouldn't have made such a stupid and obvious error.By the way the person who ""surprises"" him is Mona,Nathasha's sister.While in the Aesir building Mona comes out of nowhere to appear and saves Max's life;no rhyme nor reason except to keep Max alive until the end of the picture.I'm usually terrible at figuring out who did it ahead of time but it is not far into the film and you just KNOW that BB is the one behind all the goings on;it is just too obvious.The DVD technically is presented in its original widescreen ratio of 2:35:1 and has been transferred well.Special features are limited with just director and production designer commentary with the trailers;and neither are close captioned.The DVD does include the theatrical and unrated versions but believe me there is a little difference between the two versions that would make one better over the other.I always hope that the film versions of video games will at least try and aspire to come up to a modicum of the games original intents,feel and excitement.While many have,this one doesn't.It is great to see Beau Bridges once again as one doesn't see enough of this good actor,but he got caught in a poke this time which is unfortunate.The film is just too flimsy and shallow for anyone to rise above its' mundane foundation.I would never pay full price for this DVD nor even $5 at the bargain bin at Wal-Mart,it is so poor.I would advise you to pick up the original video game(available on many platforms)and play it yourself for a much more intense,enjoyable and satisfying experience and give THIS Max Payne a pass or you will find yourself having your own Payne-ful experience!",N/A

1248552,"I had hopes for the movie before I found out what it was about.And once it started, it just was an entirely too weak plot to really care about.There were a few good moments, like how the angel used his wings in a fight, but that was really about it.As others said, the core plot point, the baby, seemed almost an afterthought.And let's face it - if there really is a god, and he really wanted to wipe life off the planet, could some people in a truck stop really stop it?  If god really wanted to do this, why wouldn't he just do it?  What would the point be in having powerful angels possess mortal bodies so the mortal bodies could be killed so easily rather than having the angels themselves do the deed in their own form which has proven indestructible to mortal efforts?Too many holes, too many places where, even though it was a fantasy story, common sense was just stretched beyond all endurance.Some big names for such a small movie...",Legion
658346,"I  wasnt sure what to expect from this version of 310 to Yuma. But I sure wasn't disappointed.  I had seen the original version with Glenn Ford and Van Heflin. I wasn't sure whether or not  this version would stick to that version.  I have such great respect for both Christian Bale and Russell Crowe; I wasn't sure during the film which character i wanted to hope for.  I found the difference between the two movies to be the relationships.  In the earlier version I didn't feel a closeness grow between the two men in the same way as this film.  Glenn Ford seemed more menacing. Russell Crowe was more charmingly menacing.I was taken aback by the ending. The director did an amazing job with the violent scenes.  They were almost like ballet scenes.  The choreography of them gave them almost a poetic quality. Its true, as in th other reviews, i was very impressed with the supporting cast. It took me a while to recognize Peter Fonda.  He gave a superbly subtle performance.I have always been a fan of the western film.  It is great to see it back in such a successful way.

1333247,"The big news this year isn't the ""latest thing"" in Hollywood, it's one of the greatest things in classic TV: Leave it to Beaver.The long awaited for complete series is finally on DVD. Only two seasons had been released for many years, but now Shout! Factory is issuing Season Three through Six individually, with One and Two to follow, as well as the new complete series deluxe boxed set.The Complete Series box contains an bonus disc with the unaired pilot (which did not feature Tony Dow or Hugh Beaumont and included a young Harry Shearer), a public service film, promos, a vintage board game and two new documentaries: one feature length that focuses on the principals and the show's history and another at featurette length about the supporting cast, particularly Eddie and Lumpy.The feature video is documentary-style, fairly straightforward and benefits greatly from the presence of Barbara Billingsley, Jerry Mathers and Tony Dow, the latter two being involved behind the scenes as well (Mathers' brother Jimmy directed).The second video, produced and directed by Shostak, takes a more whimsical approach. What fan of ""Leave it to Beaver"" wouldn't want to see Ken ""Eddie"" Osmond and Frank ""Lumpy"" Bank give each other ""the business?"" If they just talked ""straight"" through, it would not have been as true to the two characters and the actors who, as evidenced on the ""Stu's Show"" interviews included on the individual discs.The clips in this segment are exactly the best clips to showcase Eddie and Lumpy. To someone who loves the show, like I do, as soon as each clip came on I laughed, ""Oh! I love that episode!"" It struck just the right chords.[Perhaps no other single broadcast has been able to contribute more material to a classic TV series DVD collection than Stu's Show on shokus internet radio. You can also hear Alan Young and Connie Hines, the latter in her last interview in the bonus features of Mister Ed (Young on Season One; Young and Hines on Season Two).]""Leave it to Beaver"" is a landmark show in pop culture history, not because it broke new ground or was particularly innovative, but because it honed in on the life of kids, their relationships with adults and the odd moments of life that still and will always resound, regardless of changing styles and technical inroads.If you remember it, revisit it afresh.

I loved that and now have all but one of her Acacia DVDs, although I have not used them all as of yet.This DVD opens with an 8 minute Prayer Wheel meditation.  This meditation didn't do much for me really.  I had just completed a full workout and couldn't get into standing that long during a meditation.I did very much enjoy the main flow (Heart Salutations), though.  I am recovering from knee problems so was a bit worried with some of the previous reviews, but decided to try it anyway.  My knee was only bothered a small amount - not so much by being on my knee, but in the knee that was up during the half warrior poses.  (My mat is fairly soft and so makes balancing more of an effort for the raised knee.)  However, the knee problem was not major and I continued through the practice just fine. For me, this was a nice relaxing flow.There were a couple minor flaws, both mentioned by earlier reviewers.  As mentioned, she would tell you to chant, but then did not chant along.  I'm not much of a chanting person, so that wasn't any problem for me, but it did seem a bit odd!  The other was there was one pose where she started prone and then ended up doing a spinal twist with shoulder blades on the ground.  At first I couldn't understand her instructions for this pose, and because of the shadows I couldn't see what she was doing either.

1346691,"I really wanted to like this movie.  But so many have pointed out that it is just so predictable and formulaic.  Out of his league had a lot to do with the other aspects of her life - not just her looks.  That was just completely glossed over in the movie.  That he makes her laugh is pretty much all it had going for it - or for him.I think the main problem I had with the movie was the last 1/2 hour or so.  The whole airport scene at the end wasn't funny at all.  I listened to the director's commentary and he said that they took ""liberties"" with what would really happen in an airport (security I mean).  Really?  No!?  The problem with some movies is that when they take you too far out of what is possible or real - you basically leave the story and the movie.  The movie is supposed to get you involved and immersed (at least a good one does) so when crazy things (that are NOT funny) happen - it just takes you out of the movie.So the ending was just so slap stickish (it was meant to be) that is was just silly.  This reminded me of a mystery dinner theater we went to.  A lot of the ""acting"" was to have the actors run around the dinner area chasing each other.

109856,"This movie is a comedy/drama that was released in 1994 (you can tell by the hair styles!!) and was directed by Alek Keshishian. I don't think that Mr. Keshishian had directed any movies prior to this - he was most known for directing music videos for singers like Madonna. It stars Brendan Fraser (as Montgomery ""Monty"" Kessler), Joe Pesci (as Simon Wilder), Moira Kelly (as Courtney Blumenthal), Patrick Dempsey (yes, McDreamy, as Everett Calloway) and Josh Hamilton (as Jeffrey Hawkes).Monty, Courtney, Everett and Jeffrey are seniors and roomates at Harvard University.  Monty is dead set on graduating with honors in his chosen major - political science. He has opted to write his senior thesis on economics.  The thesis is decidedly conservative and espouses and subscribes to the theories put forward by Ronald Reagan during his tenure as president. One night, after returning from a long day of classes and research, Monty goes to work on his thesis but all of his data and the thesis on his hard drive are lost when power in the house is lost. Understandably, Monty freaks out because his hard drive is fried but luckily, he has a number of chapters printed out as back up, so he opts to go down to the library to make copies that evening, instead of waiting for the morning, as his much cooler headed roomates advised.  On his way, he breaks his ankle and loses the remaining hard copy down a steam shaft. When he finally gets into the library and finds his hard copy, it is in the possession of Simon Wilder, a homeless man that lives in the boiler room of Harvard's Widener library in spite of being a former Merchant Marines. Simon also has a lot of health problems, including asbestos inhalation that was never identified and treated.  This movie details the impact that Simon, Simon's experience and his knowledge has on the four roomates, and, most notably, on Monty, whose entire worldview changes as a result of this interaction.I enjoyed this movie, not because it really packed a punch or was a movie with a message (a la Hurt Locker) that was being forced down my throat but because it was a pleasant, easy to watch movie.  It's one of those movies that you can watch that is comforting in the sense that it doesn't really push the viewer but is really high in entertainment value.  I enjoyed watching the actors and, quite frankly, I enjoyed the nostalgia of seeing Harvard, Cambridge and the Charles River in some scenes because those days were a little easier for me. And I loved Cambridge very much. Still do. The cast was wonderful, even though the movie itself could get a little saccharine and cheesy and the plot a little predictable. I also really appreciated that this was a college movie - a movie about college students - where the students seemed to try to figure themselves out as people - to increase their depth and figure out their roles in the world, instead of just trying to figure out how to get beer, more money, more pot or how to get to White Castle. They tried to navigate the moral battles that they were given and to learn from them, and I appreciated that this happened in this movie, whereas in other movies, that doesn't always happen. I really enjoyed it in general, even though it wasn't a critically acclaimed movie.This is one you should add to your collection.",N/A
281898,"Please note that I saw this movie on TV so I can't comment on the quality of the video transfer.Van Gogh's troubled life is dramatically brought to the screen in one of Douglas's greatest roles. Douglas and Quinn are superb in this movie as the two ill-fated artist friends, and also James Donald is great as van Gogh's devoted brother. The movie follows van Gogh from his departure from divinity school and his ministerial work with the miners to his ultimate suicide. Van Gogh is shown as a man who is passionate about everything in his life--his religion, his art, and his women--often to the point of being out of control. But that's why van Gogh's story is still well known today, because he lived life on the edge in otherwise conservative, dreary, repressive Victorian society.But although we're supposed to feel sorry for and empathize with the tragic van Gogh, interestingly he doesn't always make a very sympathetic character in this movie. For example, Gauguin praises van Gogh's paintings when no one else would, but in return van Gogh criticizes Gauguin's, setting the stage for another of their blow-ups. And when the woman he loves rejects him he refuses to accept it and tries to force his attentions on her.Unfortunately, the two friends are direct opposites, so their friendship is doomed from the start. Gauguin can be arrogant and abrasive even with his friends, and so the volatile and sensitive van Gogh is soon at odds with his fellow roommate, but they are thrown together by circumstances and by their rejection of the uninspired French Academy art of the day.Rejected by the art society of his day and often neglected even by his friends, fortunately van Gogh knew a few good people who helped him over the years. Pere Tanguy and Dr. Gachet were two of his admirers who were supportive, and of course his brother, who offered encouragement and supported him financially throughout his troubled life. And he is helped initially by his relative Mauve, an artist himself, who gives him materials to work with and some advice on how to proceed. The contrast between the successful and prosperous-looking Mauve's studio and van Gogh's poverty couldn't be more striking.Several times people comment about how van Gogh and Gauguin started late and so the odds are against them just because of  that. Interestingly, van Gogh, who had no formal art training, ended up developing a style that has more in common with the expressionism of forty years later than the Impressionists of his own time, with whom he is usually lumped. Considering how late they started, it's amazing van Gogh and Gauguin accomplished as much as they did.The movie does a fine job of showing many of van Gogh's paintings. I'm assuming museum-quality reproductions were obtained for the filming, but I don't know for sure. I notice that one of the professional reviews says Minelli used an obsolete color process for the movie. I'd like to know more about that and how it affected the color.Overall, a fine movie based on the Irving Stone novel. I'd also like to know what Stone thought of the movie, but I suspect he was pleased with how it turned out.",Lust for Life VHS
288360,"Viewed: 7/09Rate: 67/09: The Teahouse of the August Moon initially had me under the impression that it was going to be a Brando film. However, that was not the case at all. In fact, he only had a very minimum presence, but that didn't mean the film was terrible. On the contrary, I enjoyed it only to a certain extent. Glenn Ford clearly stole the show as he portrayed himself an affable solider who showed a change of heart through seeing effects on his attitude after experiencing a culture change. The result was quite enjoyable and sensible fun. On the other hand, I found the film to be quite unconventional and sometimes awkward to watch. One distracting part about it is the sight of Marlon Brando's face as if he just came back from a major Botox treatment. It would make a lot more sense if he was eliminated from the film altogether and be substituted with a real Japanese actor. Nevertheless, Brando did a magnificent job disguising himself as a Japanese because I couldn't tell many times if it was him or not. Some parts of the film were slow and didn't add much to the overall story. That caused choppiness in the pacing of The Teahouse of the August Moon. All in all, for what it's worth, I actually enjoyed The Teahouse of the August Moon although it is a very weird picture.",N/A

1231211,"Hope seemed to be lost for The Bellmers after their son was washed away during a tsunami in Indonesia. However, they soon discover a video of a young boy that resembles their son taken from a small village in Burma, and they set off using any means necessary to bring back their child. A blaring title sequence opens VINYAN with an air of pretension that is carried on throughout the rest of the picture. Frabrice du Welz' English-language premiere is light on character, but heavy on aesthetic and atmosphere. The eerie psychological-thriller follows a similar plot progression to Francis Ford Coppola's APOCALYPSE NOW, traveling deep into the misty jungles and deeper into the darkest recesses of the human mind. Welz' camera goes into all-wheel-drive as it tears through the jungle paths and splashes into the sea right alongside each of the characters in a rough but calculated shooting style. Although Emmanuelle Beart and Rufus Sewell provide strong performances, their portrayals of the distant Jeanne and reactionary Paul garner little support in their hunt for their missing son. VINYAN's spooky settings and frightening look at human trafficking make for a unique watch, but the thin plotting and vague ending will leave many viewers wanting more.-Carl ManesI Like Horror Movies",Vinyan
256377,"""An Affair to Remember"" is an almost perfect film. It is as deep and rich as it is stylish and romantic. And if someone tells you it is just a soap opera -- that person would be very, very wrong.Yes, the film has style to burn. Deborah Kerr was never more beautiful. Her skin looks like cream; her pert, pinched nose like a blossom. She's never been more appealing than she is here. The scene where she smiles from a boat at her fianc&eacute; on shore alone is worth the price of admission.Cary Grant seems to sleep in tuxedos. He is a walking model of male perfection.Less observant viewers come away from this movie thinking that nothing happened, that nothing was ever at stake, that nothing was risked or gained. How wrong they are.Kerr's amazing dresses -- how about the one with the pumpkin colored ribbons woven through the front? -- Grant's suavity, and the south of France settings are not just there to pose for the camera.All of the beauty of this film is there to do very hard work -- to tell a less than beautiful story.And, no, this is not a movie where nothing happens. Something is happening in every scene -- you just have to be paying attention, and you just have to be mature enough, or have your antenna up high enough, to catch the subtle messages the film is sending, and to feel in your own solar plexus, the resonances of loves, dreams, and selves risked and gained, or lost.Nicki and Terry are both gambling much here. They are wounded people in a world of high glamor; they speak in arch codes, even as their hearts are bleeding, or their breath is caught against the cage of dreams.Grant's character, Nicki Ferrante, is a lazy gigolo. ""Gigolo"" is a pretty word for an ugly situation. Ferrante is a talented artist, but he knows that he can market something else he does -- seduce women -- far more easily, and for a higher price, than he can get for his paintings.Kerr's character, Terry McKay, as she says, had to grow up very fast, and fight off a boss who -- well -- she faced some bad stuff in her life. When a steady, but less than thrilling, man offered to set her up, she, no fool, took the offer.These are two beautiful people swanning through life over some very ugly circumstances. They have both sold their best selves for easy money.And, then, completely by chance, on shipboard, they meet their soul mates. This meeting doesn't just present them with an opportunity for a one night stand. It demands that they face their own fears, and become their best selves.I'm one of those cynical people who doesn't believe in love, never mind soul mates, but this movie carries it all off so well, it makes me believe.Grant and Kerr begin with the lightest, and subtlest, of exchanges. they say things to each other -- example: ""I'd be surprised if you were surprised"" -- that, if you are not paying attention and that if you don't know a lot about life -- would just go over your head.Slowly but surely their effervescent, and yet irresistible, attraction becomes truly heavy. The scene with Grandmere Janou (Cathleen Nesbit) is amazing for all it says, without actually saying anything.I could see a naive film-goer taking in that scene and then asking, ""What was the point of that scene?"" You really have to have your eyes on the screen, and have a sensitivity to human interactions. Who is looking at whom; whose face is suddenly hidden and why; who is saying what without actually saying it; and why does the sound of that boat whistle bring tears -- you have to be willing to pay attention, and to have a sense of life and human relationships, and, yes, an openness to the possibility of there being a God to understand that scene.Here you have a man and a woman who have, basically, sold themselves to the highest bidder, and who, at that point, are perilously close to cheating. What happens? Their love is blessed by the Virgin Mary. Heavy stuff.""We changed our course today."" Truer words were never spoken.I've got to hand it to Leo McCarey, who wrote and directed this film as well as the Academy Award winning ""Going My Way."" He so wonderfully brings the best, and most complex, aspects of Catholicism to the screen here. Catholicism is associated with the romance languages -- French, Italian -- and it also is friendly to this kind of romance -- a romance where fallen beauties are blindsided by the kind of tortuous, redemptive, overwhelming, fated love that demands, and gets, everything, after which, you are never the same.If you haven't seen the movie, or ""Sleepless in Seattle,"" I won't reveal the ending to you. I'll just say that merely thinking about the ending can make me cry such tears as, really, very few films I've ever seen can make me cry. These tears are their own species.",An Affair to Remember VHS

This amusingly campy horror movie is perfect for riffing, and the crew do a wonderful job - a must see.- Hercules Against the Moon Men: When science fiction meets Greek mythology...and the results aren't terribly pretty. The riffs however, are hilarious, especially when Joel wistfully mentions how much he misses Earth...- Hercules Unchained: An interesting episode - the movie on display is something of a foreign film epic, combining several stories of Greek mythology, with surprising attention to the details of the source material. The overall effect, though, is a movie that slogs through the myths and legends of the Greeks without really retaining viewer interest, which is where the excellent riffs come in. Probably the best part of this episode is the interlude where the bots ask Joel what Hercules and the ""nice lady"" do all day, especially between the judicious cut-aways...- Prince of Space: A black-and-white science fiction foreign film that is poorly dubbed, terribly slow-paced, and somewhat difficult to riff, this episode is fair, but fairly forgettable.~ Ana Mardoll",N/A

1301441,"When you see the headline actors here as being Tina Fey and Steve Carell, you think, ""Man, this one's gonna be hilarious."" You couldn't be more wrong. Tina Fey's obnoxious approach to comedy is usually right on the button, and Steve Carell (from the comedy perspective) can be hit or miss.  Hit - ""40-Year Old Virgin"" and ""Anchorman.""  Miss - ""Dan In Real Life"" and ""Get Smart.""This movie couldn't make up its mind what it wanted to do. Should it be a suspense film, or should it be a comedy? Should it be a comedy/suspense film? Answer: None of the above. Date Night tried too hard to be funny with a storyline that was fighting to disallow comedy from the word ""Go."" The punchlines that forced their way into the dialogue from time to time seemed out of place and contrived. If you're going to have a comedy that involves suspense, maybe you should consider having some bumbling idiots as bad guys or, at the very least, characters with some sense of derivative humor to offset the seriousness of the film, which, in turn, would make this a flick for the comedy/suspense genre. The bad guys here were straight and unfunny.Steve and Tina had a couple of semi-amusing one-liners, but, for the most part, their characters were boring and underdeveloped in an already compromised film, and there was practically nothing they could do, given their highly-regarded comedic talents, to pull this movie from the dregs it was bound to drudge in from the start.Here's an idea: If you're going to make a comedy...make a comedy. This movie was too serious to be funny. As my two-year-old daughter would say, ""Ucky!""",N/A

1037668,"Bottom-Line: Shortbus is at times physically stimulating, but not as much as it is emotionally and mentally) arousing; and aren't those the two erogenous zones that matter most in sex?It's a sad testimony to American cinema that the vast majority of (Hollywood produced) movies come and go without much in the memory to mark their passing.  In their effort to appeal to a mass world-wide audience the denizens of the America's entertainment empire have taken to producing (mostly) movies without much heart, soul, or message.  Thankfully independent film producers and distributors (in this case Think Films) have stepped in and are beginning to release films that bring edge, promise, and meaning back to American cinema.  Such a movie is the (NC-17, sexually explicit ) Shortbus (2006), a biting, edgy, sex laden amusing romp set in contemporary New York City, written and directed by John Cameron Mitchell (Hedwig and the Angry Inch).Variety Magazine called Shortbus ""The most sexually graphic American narrative feature ever made outside the realm of the porn industry."" And make no mistake Shortbus is sexually graphic with depictions of real oral/vaginal sex, and masturbation.  Both heterosexual and homosexual are given equal time here folks so keep the kiddies far away from this movie.But despite the graphic nature of the sex in Shortbus, the film turns out to be a rather funny yet engaging film about sex, relationships, and people enjoying or trying to enjoy sex.  The sex is just a by-product of the relationships the individuals form over the course of the film; dare I say it flows naturally, it does not pretend to be, it just is.You know what you are in for from the opening frames of the film when James (Paul Dawson) is videotaping himself in the bathtub and playing with his penis (yes it is shown, there is full frontal nudity here folks) and then engages in a limber display of self-stimulation complete with (filmed) climax.  His home video at first seems narcissistic and even pornographic, but as the film progresses we get to know James for the deeply sad person he is and the reason for the film.  James is dad even as his (monogamous) partner of five years Jamie (P.J. DeBoy), is decidedly chipper and upbeat; i.e. his emotional polar opposite.  Jamie is almost frenzied, extroverted and just wants to love everybody, and want everybody to love him.Sensing something is wrong with James and their relationship, Jamie suggests that they experiment sexually with other people and this leads to a rather comical group sex (orgy) scene at a local apartment; the gathering is referred to as a Shortbus. Their search for answers also leads them to a sex therapist (who prefers to be called a couples therapist) named Sofia (Sook-Yin Lee).  During the opening sequence of the movie she is seen having wild engaging in (un-simulated) wild sex with her husband Rob (Raphael Barker) in every room in their apartment and trying positions straight from the Kama Sutra how-to manual.  But we soon learn that Sophia is pre-orgasmic (her term) meaning she has never had an orgasm--even through self stimulation and has been faking them for years in order to spare her husband ego.  So that the fact that she's a sex therapist proves to be one of the most deliciously ironic sub-plots of the movie, as she tries again and again to achieve one.And then there is Severin (Lindsay Beamish) a dominatrix who is so closed off that she forbids anyone to touch her, though she surrounds herself with Polaroid's she takes of random people.  But she is lonely and longs for a normal life with a house, white picket fence, little ones, and vaginal orgasms.  And there is Ceth (Jay Brannan) who becomes the (brief) third in James and Jamie's relationship. Finally, there is a very flamboyant Justin Bond who runs Shortbus and a Caleb (Peter Stickles) a voyeuristic young man who has been watching James and Jamie from his apartment across the street.The cast of Shortbus is composed of mostly unknowns and newcomers; it's hard to image any Hollywood ""A"" listed actor/actress going as far as the characters did in the movie for the sake of their art-form (though Chloe Sevigny did her part in 2003's Brown Bunny).  But the lack of star presence lent a nice layer of realism to the film it might otherwise have lacked.The most poignant and challenging performances in Shortbus belong to Paul Dawson and Sook-Yin Lee, though the movie must have been challenging for all involved give the nature of the film.  And yet after I finished watching Shortbus it was not so much the explicit sex that stayed with me--though it left its mark--it was the deeper meaning of the film; trying to puzzle out the reasons for the various characters sexual hang-up's and other emotional trauma's.  Why did Sofia's orgasm continue to elude her; why is James so profoundly sad, so much so that he plans to take his own life; why is Severin so closed off?In the end what makes Shortbus such an eye-opening American film is not the explicit sex contained therein, but that the movie is not afraid to explore it in such a grown up manner; it does not titillate, nor does it insult, is shows us sex as it would be if the camera were not there.  To be sure Shortbus is at times physically stimulating, but not as much as it is emotionally and mentally) arousing; and aren't those the two erogenous zones that matter most in sex?Rated NC-17 for graphic sex and language.",Shortbus

323944,"I don't have much to add to what the other reviews have specified about the new BD version of RHPS, but I have to say the new 7.1 DTS HD audio track blows all of the other previous home video versions out of the water.  It always bugged me that the stereo mixes on the older versions dating back to VHS and laserdisc merely used the original soundtrack album recording dubbed over the movie soundtrack.  This was most notable during the ""Time Warp"" when Magenta would sing.  The vocals in the movie are completely different from the vocals on the album.  The movie has more of a ""sung live"" sound while the album is definitely a studio recording.  I'm so happy to be able to hear Patricia Quinn's vocals from the movie now on Blu-ray!  Also, the picture is so sharp that I saw numbers written on Tim Curry's thigh that I never noticed before and I've seen the movie well over 100 times.  My only concern is an odd little ""beep"" that happens during the ""Time Warp"" when the party-goers ""bring their knees in tight.""  It's a very strange little sound that happens every time the knees come together.  I don't know if this is something only on the 7.1 track as I haven't listened to the other versions yet, but it was odd and I hope not a problem with the audio since it is superior to any other version to date.  The disk also includes the US and UK versions as well as the option to see the first part of the movie as it was originally intended - in black and white!

1270865,"I have been practicing with this DVD for the last couple of weeks, so I finally feel I can write a half way decent review. Before I go into detail, I would say, like some of the other reviewers, that you need to have some basic knowledge of the yoga poses Rea demonstrates, or at least watch the DVD a couple times, like I did, to get the hang of it. I think Shiva has been practicing yoga for so long, it has become 2nd nature to her, therefore, some of the instruction isn't as detailed or she just omits certain aspects of the poses that may be beneficial to a newcomer.Nevertheless, since the DVD offers a variety of vinyasa solar and lunar flows, it is still a fantastic DVD. If you own several of Shiva's DVD's like I do, you will certainly recognize segments from each one, hence the title of my review. She does introduce some really awesome cool poses in the Shanti and Heart-Air segments that are well worth the price of admission, but what I find clever or ingenious is the way she was able to mix and match some of the vinyasa flows from her previous collections into something more interesting and dynamic on this DVD. For the most part, the poses flow much smoother compared to some of her previous DVDs. In addition, I loved the way she grouped vinyasas by either solar (active) or lunar (relaxing) so it makes it so much easier to pick a practice. Below are some more detailed pros and cons to the DVD:PROs: 1) Seven segments that run approximately 20 minutes, which easily fits into anyone's schedule. 2) Great mix of solar and lunar practices depending on your needs that day. 3) Additionally, there are 2 opening meditations for warming up, again solar or lunar depending on your preference, as well as a core sequence and forward bend sequence, each lasting about five to six minutes. 4) Easy-to-use yoga matrix with a ""Clear Selection"" option should you mess up. 5) An awesome soundtrack playing in the background while you practice, of course, you can just do music only if you wish. 6) Finally, a really cool indoor set, surprising considering she typically practices outside, but very well done.CONs: 1) A little more detailed instruction flowing from pose to pose would be appreciated. 2. A companion CD or MP3 download of the entire soundtrack, because I just absolutely loved the music.Other than those minor caveats, this DVD has a lot to offer. I would say Shiva took something old and made it new again. The DVD really mixes her traditional poses with some of her more fluid ones. As she states in her introduction, it is more beneficial to do shorter periods of yoga everyday as opposed to doing longer periods of yoga every couple days or weeks. Hope you enjoy as much as I have.",N/A

103383,"I have had this film on my desk for review for a long,long time and now with the recent re-release(June/10)by Warners of Midnight in the Garden of Good and Evil,along with many other Clint Eastwood titles,I thought it would be a good time to review it.As you probably know the movie is the /97 adaption of John Berendt's /94 bestseller of the same name,which appeared on the New York Time's bestseller list for over 200 hundred days.Like most adaptions from book to film this one is not a true recreation by any stretch,however director Eastwood manages to create a wonderful,one might say,southern gothic-like atmoshpere which slowly but surely draws the viewer in,as character after character colourfully fills in his visual canvas.The story involves a wanna be author John Kelso(John Cusak)who goes to Savannah,Georgia on commission from a magazine similar in nature to Better Homes and Gardens.His purpose is to do a 500 word article on the home and annual famous soiree given by local Jim Williams(Kevin Spacey).Mr.Williams is a very influential,rich but affable man with apparently a very large base of friends.Kelso attends said party and leaves but later that night he is awakened by the sounds of police car sirens.It seems Mr.Williams has shot one Billy Hanson(Jude Law),a ""handyman"" who he employs.Coincidentally Kelso had been witness to a verbal altercation Williams had had with Hanson during the party.Williams is arrested and tells a story of self defense.The subsequent trial reveals many sordid details not only of Hanson but of Williams himself.It seems Hanson's relationship with Williams,and with others,was more than platonic.As things drag on the defence seems to be getting pushed into a corner until Kelso uncovers some incriminating evidence at the hospital,which ultimately the defence will use to exonerate him.However before William's lawyer shows up to tell his client the good news,Williams and Kelso have a heart to heart in which Williams says he killed Hanson,but not quite in the self defence manner he previously was adhering to.Kelso is taken aback but when the lawyer shows up Williams reverts back to his old story.The ""not guilty"" verdict is a slam dunk.Now free Kelso and Williams meet one last time at his home.As he leaves Kelso asks him what the real story was.Williams replies""Truth,like art,is in the eye of the beholder"".After he leaves Williams has a heart attack and falls to the floor dead.After the funeral Kelso decides to remain in Savannah to write a book on the incident.This film is chock full of colourful characters that one might find in Huckleberry Fin or To Kill a Mockingbird.Along with Williams southern affability we have Lady Chablis(Chablis Deaveau),a drag queen in real life,who provides most of the films most amusing moments,usually in tandem with John Cusack.Australian actor(!)Jack Thompson is Williams rotund,easy going,good old boy stereo-typical southern lawyer-friend.Clint's daughter Allsion plays a local called Mandy,who comes in and out of the proceedings but projects a wonderful laid back but sex-tinged aura.Clint draws on one of his more well known and used stable of actors from many of his other films in Geoffrey Lewis.He plays a very eccentric local who walks around with horse flies attached to strings and a bottle of poison water which everyone thinks he might one day spoil the local water supply with.Irma Hall plays with wonderful relish,a local voodoo woman called Minerva that Williams uses and also is seen constantly throughout keeping it all good with the spirit world.It is these and others that inhabit this portrayal of old Savannah,its culture(its' famous musical son Johnny Mercer is given on screen mention along with his music),its people and its flavour that makes this such an appealing drama/film.And Clint does a masterful job immersing us in that atmosphere.Techincally speaking,though there is no indication it has been remastered,Waners seems to have at least struck a new print as the picture is quite clean and crisp.And although the blurb for this film on Amazon sites lists this movie in widescreen AND full screen,it is ONLY in widescreen.It has many special features including an interactive tour of Savannah,featurettes on the cast and the characters in the book and film along with the trailer.All in all a very good and recommended tale of the old card game of deception and truth in the old south,specifically Savannah,Georgia.You can almost smell those magnolia blossoms,taste that cool ice tea and feel the humidity all around.",N/A

Barbara Daniel's acting is superb and her singing is gorgeous.  Domingo is no kid, but who cares?  What a great voice.  Really, the whole cast is wonderful, including the singer who plays Jake Wallace.I've watched this video dozens of times and never tire of it.

1218044,"In the time it took between the release of Seasons 1 & 2 and Season 3, I could have constructed these DVDs myself.  I don't know what the problem was, and frankly, I don't care.  I finally have another installment of Just Shoot Me to watch.  Season 3 starts off with Finch (Spade) getting caught romping with Jack's daughter's nanny on a Nanny Cam hidden in a teddy bear.  Hysterical. Over-the-top.  There are so many great episodes in this season.  Slow Donnie, where Elliott's brother Donnie is pretending to be retarded but keeps trying to pick up on Maya.  The episode where Maya is convinced her new boyfriend (French Stewart, Harry from 3rd Rock) is sending her messages from his children's show through the puppets he uses.  The one where Mark Hamill follows Finch around the office for a few days, bugging him to death about what he does, just to prove a psycho-fan point.  And the two-part season ender where Finch toys with an emotially-vulnerable supermodel (Rebeca Romijn) to impress on old high school acquaintance and ends up marrying her when he realizes this is the best his ife could ever get.  I could go through every one, but I won't.  It is hysterical.  Hilarious.  Cutting humor and quick dialogue. Still fresh as the day it was shot.  Now hopefully Season 4 will be here before I have to use bifocals to watch it.  Awesome TV!  Cannot go wrong.DIG IT!!!!!!!!!!!!",Just Shoot Me: Season 3
1235611,"There are some folks here who have said that although this series is different from the original, it is still the same quality of story and almost as good as the original. I am going to disagree. The animation is very different, the girls are very different, but most importantly the story line is not as good. This is not the original, it is not as good as the original, and I can't think of a single thing that was improved in this version.The girls have been ""glamorized"" for this series. Big eyes, cute hair, etc. Henrietta looks nothing like her character from the original series. The moment that I noticed this, I knew there was only one reason to make this change - the story is not as good as the original and they need to prop up the series by making the girls more attractive.The animation is not of the same quality as the original. Many shortcut methods were used to reduce cost and stretch frames. This I could forgive if the story made up for it. Alas, it does not.That said, the most important aspect of the original series was the storyline and the time spent developing the girls' characters. This critical element of the original series' success is sorely lacking in this series. The entire time I watched this series, I kept asking ""where are the girls?!"" This series spends too much time on characters I do not care about and that contribute nothing to enhance the story. Where is the action? I want more action WITH the girls. What I remember most about watching this series is constantly wondering when the girls were coming back and why are they giving me a soap opera with characters I don't care about. When they did finally get around to the formula that worked in the original series, it was always too little and I would be disappointed when they went back to the soap opera.If you loved the original series as much as I did, you are going to be seriously disappointed with this one. If you must have it to complete your collection, or as in my case, having a serious need for more GSG, then by all means go ahead.

25640,"This remarkable film defies genre conventions as casually as its hero encounters oddity after oddity in the strange other-world of Alphaville. Filmed on the cheap, the use of street signs and neon lights defamiliarizes the standard ""city at night""and reshapes it to unusual effect. Alphaville is a town where love is prohibited, where yes means no, where political assassinations are orchestrated like sporting events. It happens to be run by a computer that will challenge our hero (Lemmy Caution -- what a great name!)to an interview in which our rough looking protagonist reveals himself to have the soul of a poet. This marks him as especially suspicious. The influence of this super-computer on Kubrick's HAL9000 is unmistakeable. If you've done any reading at all in the work of influential French philosophers of the 1960s (Foucault, Barthes, Derrida) you'll pick up on dozens and dozens of clever, even witty, references to their ideas in this film. Visually noteworthy are the circling movements that characters and cameras make, often delightfully disorienting.

928397,"La Edicion esta bastante bien hecha en cuanto a la Telenovela, tiene coherencia, para ser Resumenes, pero quitaron asbolutamente todas las escenas donde Rosalinda canta, sacaron la cancion Ay Amor Rosalinda de la Entrada, y contiene un Midi espantozo. El Videoclip que hay como Extra de la Presentacion del Teatro Blanquita tampoco tiene la cancion original, tiene el mismo sonido midi. Realmente para lo que es la Telenovela, esta edicion me desepciono, anulan todas las escenas de la carrera de ella como cantante y se centra mas en el dramatismo de la historia que en esa esencia que forma parte de la tira. No me mato la edicion, esperaba otra cosa, realmente la compre porque soy Fan de Thalia, y para la coleccion, pero me hubiese gustado que fuera diferente, que al menos le hubiesen dejado la cancion original porque ni siquiera tiene la musica incidental de cuando se transmitio. Por otra parte note un detalle muy importante, y es que sacaron las escenas donde muere Rene Mu&ntilde;oz, el Abuelo Florentino despues de enfrentarse con Valeria en su casa, si bien se ve la escena donde Valeria lo envenena no se se ve cuando muere ni cuando le avisan a Rosalinda, ni el velorio ni nada de eso, que por cierto no hace falta ser muy inteligente para darse cuenta que despues de esa escena entre Valeria y el no aparece mas en todo lo que resta de la Telenovela, se olvidaron ese detalle, que me parece de muy mal gusto. Lo ideal seria que si la volvieran a Editar lanzaran el Dvd al menos con una cancion de Thalia y no con el Midi que contiene esta edicion ya que la musica es espantoza y si la quitaron por derechos de copyright al menos hubieran elegido cualquier tema de Thalia, hubiera sido mejor, como tambien seria bueno que dejaran las presentaciones donde Rosalinda canta, como Paloma Dorantes y como Rosalinda, ya que no pusieron ninguna, al menos que las pasaran como secuencias con otra musica, como hicieron con el Videoclip que esta como extra.",N/A
299191,"I can't count the number of times I've wished this movie would come true.  Most SF films have portrayed aliens as hostile to humanity.  This one takes a different approach.  The main character, an ambassador from a planetary alliance similar to Star Trek's United Federation of Planets, arrives in Washington DC via flying saucer.  His name is Klaatu, and he has a giant metal robot named Gort that acts as his bodyguard.  He has a message that's vital to humanity's future, but before he can deliver it he's shot and wounded by a trigger happy soldier.  Gort responds by wiping out a number of tanks and other military vehicles with a ray weapon fired from his helmet, but takes no lives in the process.Recovering at an inhumanly fast rate, Klaatu frees himself from the military hospital he's being held in and decides to go undercover and observe the human race firsthand.  Along the way he makes the acquaintance of a young widow, (played by the lovely Patricia Neal), her adolescent son and her jerk boyfriend.  Meanwhile Gort is encased in a clear metallic alloy that the Army believes will render him unable to move.The film culminates with Klaatu delivering an ultimatum to an assembled group of world leaders, with Gort, who has proven himself to be unstoppable, at his side. Klaatu's terms: earth is invited give up its warlike ways and join the interplanetary alliance.  World peace will be assured by a police force consisting of Gort and his robot buddies, who will use advanced technology to punish any nation that invades another.  If earth spurns the invitation then it will be ""reduced to a burned out cinder"" to prevent it from spreading its violence throughout the galaxy.  Klaatu departs after delivering this message, with the question of how the world will respond left open.The movie has a single flaw.  Its special effects are cheesy, even by 1950s standards.  In every other respect it's excellent.  The acting, storyline, scripting, etc. are superior to 95% of the films made today.  Its message is as relevant now as it was when it was made.  To put it simply, this is science fiction at its best, not to be confused with the obscenely bad Keanu Reeves version.  Watch the original.

422253,"I've thought The Phantom was one cool comic strip hero since I was a kid. I never felt like I really got enough of the character, and I was delighted when a feature film was made. I wasn't disappointed.The story is exciting, and acting performances are rich. Treat Williams drips charisma and evil. An early look at Catherine Zeta Jones is eye catching, and she gives a solid performance as the leader of an all woman mercenary team.Billy Zane hits a home run as the Phantom. First, he looks good in the suit. That's always a must for a costumed hero film. Second, he gives a confident performance of a heroic character, and delivers his clever ""humor"" lines with just the right amount of wry charm. Zane (and/or stunt men) give the character a sense of strength and grace that are demanded to make the Phantom work on screen.The cinematography is beautiful to behold, especially jungle and water scenes. They draw you right into the screen. As a cap off, I also enjoyed the score, and the main theme is catchy, which I also like to have in a comic hero movie. The movie is a feast for the senses, and for fans of the Comic strip. My only regret was that it did not do well enough at the box office to spawn a string of sequels.We also enjoyed the Phantom serial from the OLD movie days.

874242,"This movie tries to offer some deep thought but comes out as nothing more then what is commen today...empty shallowness.  The movie serves no purpose.....while its supposed to come off as being ""funny"" to me it just came off as being incredibly stupid.  Its something about the meaning of life and yes there are some deeper truths in it like about what does it mean to be pretty...and such. but truth is its lost in the paper thin plot that you will never really get anything out of it unless your one of those people who over analyzes everything.  The only reason i watched the whole thing was to see if there was going to be some earth shattering ending that would make the whole thing make seance.......there is none.  The very opening of the movie where the guy starts cursing for no reason at all pretty much sums up the entire movie..  Made for people who have no brains and anyone who actually find this movie interesting has about as much personality as the people in the movie did.One of the stupidest movies i have seen in a long time.  I dont understand how some critics can give some other movies 1 or 2 stars that are actually pretty good and then give bs like this a high review when its a total waste of time.Its one of those movies that you hear was pretty good so you sit and watch the whole thing hoping to find something at least in the end to make it all worthwhile....some big finish that would make you say ""ooh that was worth it""there is no such finish.Save your money for something else this is not even worth watching once.",N/A

I simply run out of words to really describe the breathtaking performences in the film right from the direction, acting to to the cinematography and background score of the film. Jeremy Irons is simply brilliant, shines with immense excellence, the more that could be said about him as Humbert, the lesser it is.

1336668,"(actually I'd give it two and a half stars, but the template won't let me go halfway on a star... but since I *really wanted to like* this movie more than the final verdict left me, figured I er on the side of nice.)So, the movie version of one of the best werewolf novels ever... wound up as a direct-to-redbox cheapy. Nowhere near as bad as feared; in fact, there's a lot going for this, particularly in atmosphere and inspired character-actor casting - I think I'm in love with Eva Amurri and Nickie Aycox [hot werewolf girls... literally at each other's throats... *growl*], Marc Blucas is perfectly cast and deserves to go far as an actor, and villain Naveen Andrews is a pure wicked treat. But I swear, someone in the freakin' editing room must have been on a Mission to make this movie suck! And the story/mythos-changes did nothing but clutter things worse. Also, they made that most frequent of gambles when adapting material like this from page to screen, namely taking story elements that were withheld 'til later in the book, creating tension and mystery that built to surprise twists, and presenting it in real-time from the git-go (as in pretty much every screen/stage version of DR. JEKYLL & MR. HYDE). Sometimes said switch-around works out well, in other cases not. Here... not so much :-/ And seriously, when adapting a 500-page novel with a rather packed plot, there's no excuse for so much filler in the first half of an 80-minute movie, then truncating the second half of the story within an inch of its life. All that internal POV/voice-over/werewolf-DNA-microscope-footage nonsense was a nightmare (and not in the good way you'd hope for from this sort of movie). Still, I confess, I actually like how they made use of low-rent CGI for their creature effects. If you can't make your otherworldly creature look convincingly physically *there*, why not go the other way and have it look intentionally *not* quite there, semi-spectral, suggesting your beastie's not fully of this dimension of existence. Makes perfect sense to me, to where it's a wonder someone didn't think of it sooner. Stephen Sommers should take notes.",N/A
417170,"Combat Shock is a no-budget film directed by Buddy Giovinazzo released under the Troma label. I've never watched a film by Troma, but I know what films they're associated with. When titles from their company include The Toxic Avenger and Tromeo & Juliet, I didn't expect much from Combat Shock and it took me a while to get around to watching it. It's a surprisingly well-made film that is both bleak and effective...Think of Taxi Driver without a budget and with even less optimism.Ricky Giovinazzo (who also did the score and went on to be involved with the scores of just about every film you can name) stars as Frankie Dunlan, a Vietnam veteran and former P.O.W. living in squalor in New York. The film opens in Vietnam as Frankie talks of the nightmares that haunt him every night. He lives with his wife and child, who is hideously deformed due to the chemicals he was exposed to in Vietnam; he has no job and can't afford to feed himself or his family and he owes money around town.The film works quite well in it's strange, low-budget way. Frankie's baby doesn't look human (it conjures up memories ofEraserhead), but it doesn't look laughable either. I found the film's score to be too '80s, but it actually fits the tone of the film. Obviously, Hollywood was fond of Giovinazzo's musical skill.The film has the grainy, gritty look of a cult film but Combat Shock actually has a relative impact. It's a dark story with a few scenes (most occurring at the end) hat are incredibly unsettling. Certain aspects of the film aside, there is a certain amount of realism in the film too...Combat Shock is a film that will surprise you. It looks and feels like an exploitation film, but works as a gritty, violent, and disturbing look at post-traumatic stress disorder. It's an uncompromising film that you won't easily forget.GRADE: A-",Combat Shock VHS
800914,"""The Hound of the Baskerville's"" was made in the late 1930's and stars Basil Rathbone as the famous Sherlock Holmes.  The story is interesting and a classic ""who done it"" that ages well, in black and white cinema.The story is about Sir Henry Baskerville, who returns to his ancestral hall after traveling abroad.  A Dr. Mortimer asks Holmes to protect the life of Sir Henry Baskerville, his best friend's nephew.  It is revealed that Mortimer's friend, Sir Charles Baskerville, recently died and although it was ruled a natural death, Dr. Mortimer knew he was being chased by the legendary Hound of the Baskervilles.  This hound has plagued the Baskerville family for years.While Holmes attends to other matters in London, his partner,  Watson (Nigel Bruce),  is sent to stay with Sir Henry and keep an account of routine as well as puzzling happenings at the ancestral estate and hall.  He is dedicated to protecting Sir Henry and notes the puzzling actions of servants in the hall.  Odd happening before included a single boot stolen at Sr. Henry's hotel room before arriving at his ancestral home.Sir Henry is an eligible, handsome bachelor and soon meets the beautiful Beryl Stapleton and her brother John.  Sir Henry and Beryl soon start keeping company and become engaged.  The puzzling plot thickens as Holmes reveals he has been masquerading as a bum who lives in the moors.  He has solved the murder mystery in his mind, and knows Sr. Henry is next.  However, he needs to catch the murderer ""red handed"".  Holmes hatches a smart trap to catch the killer and solve the mysteries of the Baskervilles.Overall, the movie is an entertaining mystery.",Sherlock Holmes - The Hound of the Baskervilles
278064,"Death Wish 3 may well be Michael Winner's seminal work, finally breaking free of the chains of logic or narrative that had confined his earlier work to explode in an orgy of wildly improbable violence where he stages World War Three in a New York neighborhood besieged by gangs, with the combatants assorted street punks and elderly, mostly nice Jewish couples. Those kids never stood a chance...For the first hour it's just a deceptively shonky vigilante movie, with Winner going through the motions as Ed Lauter's disillusioned cop, having first wrongly arrested Charles Bronson's vigilante for the murder of one of the few people in the film he doesn't kill, had him beaten up and thrown in the tank, then decides to set him loose on a problem neighborhood. Charlie fits right in with the assorted senior citizens and stereotypes who make up the put-upon locals, and it's not long before he's rigging booby traps in their houses to maim or disfigure would-be home invaders, shooting bag snatchers in the back or interrupting dinner with Mr and Mrs Kaprov to kill a couple of punks trying to steal his car stereo before returning to finish off the meal of delicious cabbage soup. None of which pleases Gavan O'Herlihy's local gang leader who sports an interesting anti-Mohican hairstyle and it's not long before far more locals are meeting horrible deaths than when the gangs had a free hand before Charlie moved in. With Bronson's character having run out of relatives to be killed off to inspire another rampage in the last movie and his old army buddy killed off early in the picture obviously deemed not enough motivation for him to unleash hell, Deborah Raffin's lawyer with the hots for Charlie draws the short straw and ends up in a crash in one of those extremely inflammable cars that only need the slightest fender bender to explode. So it's out with the Lewis machineguns and rocket launcher while O'Herlihy is on the phone to rentamob to get reinforcements (literally: he just picks up a phone and says ""I need more guys. Yeah, thanks,"" and they arrive).Filmed mostly in London for extra surrealism, all of Winner's trademarks are here: lazy plotting, abrupt editing, gratuitous rape scenes and clumsy acting even from old pros like Martin Balsam, not to mention the odd familiar face who probably doesn't put this one on their resume - in this case Bill and Ted's Alex Winter and Star Trek: The Next Generation's Marina Sirtis (or, more appropriately, this being a Michael Winner film, Marina Sirtis' breasts). There's also endlessly quotable direlogue (""I can't do anything, I'm a cop,"" ""Mrs. Rodriguez has expired."" ""But you told me over the phone she only had a broken arm?"" and the immortal ""Chicken's good. I like chicken""). But it's that last half hour that elevates the film from mere crap to unbelievably delirious, insanely inspired not just unashamed but damn proud of it crap. The finale is a smorgasboard of just plain wrong that abandons any notion of credibility to rack up the largest possible body count: cops die by the score, buildings burn and Bronson's enthusiastic taking out the trash inspires the neighborhood to come together in a merciless killing spree of their own. At one point the old folks run a chain across the street to knock several heavies off their bikes, run up to them and repeatedly shoot them on the ground and then all the local children run in and START DANCING OVER THE DEAD BODIES!!!Even though another two Death Wish movies followed, this was the end of Bronson and Winner's association. Bronson was ill throughout the shoot and hated the level of violence - apparently Winner felt the body count was too low and added more killings and carnage when Bronson was off the set. (Bronson wasn't the only one to be appalled - whereas Brian Garfield was so angry at the changes Winner made to his anti-vigilante novel that he wanted to sue him over the first film, this time round screenwriter Don Jakoby took his name off the picture - and this is a guy who has his name on Tobe Hooper's LifeForce and Invaders From Mars!). Perhaps it was just as well: even if they tried, it's inconceivable that director or star could ever equal the sheer unsane ambition on display here.While their DVD release was fullframe, MGM/UA's US Blu-ray offers a scrubbed up widescreen print (at times almost too scrubbed up for a film that actually looks better down and dirty) with the original trailer the only extra.",N/A

The original ""The Matrix"" was always considered to be a benchmark for DVD image quality, but this Blu-Ray edition improves upon it dramatically.

1085853,"R.L. Stine's ""The Haunting Hour: Don't Think About It"", is a 2007 direct-to-video movie (which also aired on Cartoon Network as primetime Halloween programming) about a 13 year old goth girl named Cassie who is mad at the world for no visible reason other than having apparently zero friends at school. Of course, that could be due to the fact that she dresses like she might put a hex on you if you tick her off. She does get tormented by one student, the super popular, super beautiful Priscilla, but whether or not this is a daily problem or the result of Cassie's attempt to buddy up with the guy Priscilla wants to go out with is unknown. Anyway, after a bad lunchroom scene and even worse Halloween Dance revenge, things get heated between Priscilla and Cassie, and the object of their desires, sweet but not so bright school heartthrob Sean, is caught in the middle. Enter ""The Evil Thing"", a book Cassie buys at an odd curiosity shop that pops up out of nowhere just long enough to make the one sale. Within the locked pages of what reads like a children's book is something that amounts to a conjuring spell, summoning an evil creature when read aloud that begins hunting down people around Cassie one by one. Luckily, they are just stored away for the creatures soon to be hatched babies, but it's soon up to Cassie to rescue the captured victims on Halloween night if she wants them to live to see November!I have to give props to R.L. Stine and the makers of this fun little direct to video movie. Sure, the characters are all stereotypical, and yeah, there's a shameless Papa John's plug (it is NOT as bad as everyone says, and it wouldn't have phased anyone if it was a made-up pizza brand used; why be scared of realism?), and the evil book itself reads so silly that, well, that you're reminded of how corny Goosebumps and similar shows often were. And, frankly, it's hard to like the heroine here, as she is kind of a little witch half the time for no good reason. Her brother IS super annoying though. But, regardless of my occasional desire to side with the ""mean girl"" in this one, largely because that actress is a hottie hot hottie (don't jump on my head, she IS 20 now, and she was in her later teens when she made this), and all that other stuff I mentioned before, this is a fun, enjoyable movie that has more bite to it than any of the other Stine stuff I've tried out. It's actually a scary movie for kids, which is nice and different, and it's entertaining for all ages if you are young at heart and LOVE Halloween. Personally, I don't think there are enough movies that feature the joyful traditions of Halloween, from trick or treating to parties and so on, so the more the merrier. I look forward to making this one at least an annual viewing and recommend you at least give it a try if you like Halloween-themed movies and specials or R.L. Stine. This is among the better ones in both categories.The DVD is available in widescreen or fullscreen (don't get fullscreen, come on), so watch which one you pick up, and there are 4 bonus features that are pretty good mostly. Yeah, interesting thing to note: The back of the DVD lists 3 of the Bonus Features, then says, ""And More!"", but as is usually the case, there is only one more, ha. Anyway, those features are a Making Of featurette, an Emily Osment (who plays Cassie) music video (in which we see her how we're more used to seeing her, the total opposite of her character, ha), an entertaining bravery profile game called ""Scare-O-Meter"", and a pretty good little interview with R.L. Stine. The various bonus features include interviews with the main stars, of course, Emily Osment (Cassie), Cody Linley (Sean), and the lovely Brittany Elizabeth Curran (Priscilla). Saw's Tobin Bell also stars as the mysterious shopkeeper. Great family viewing for something scary but family friendly on Halloween. Also recommended for Halloween viewing, some family friendly, some not, are the following: ""It's the Great Pumpkin, Charlie Brown"", ""Garfield's Halloween Adventure"", the Scary Godmother specials, ""Sleepy Hollow"", ""Ichabod and Mr. Toad"", Hallmark's ""Legend of Sleepy Hollow"", ""Alvin and the Chipmunks Meet the Wolfman"", ""Spaced Invaders"", ""The Witches"", ""The Worst Witch"", the Harry Potter series, ""Mickey's House of Villains"", the ""Halloween"" film series, ""Trick `r Treat"", and, if you can find them, ""The Halloween That Almost Wasn't"" (AKA The Night Dracula Saved the World), ""Raggedy Ann and Andy and the Pumpkin That Couldn't Smile"", ""Halloween with the Addams Family"", and ""The Midnight Hour"". Of course, there ARE others...",N/A

622111,"This movie has the feel of a comic book brought to life (in fact, the first half of the movie actually has a segment consisting of comic book animation). This stylistic choice enables Tarantino to present a lot of potentially very disturbing material, especially abundant violence in Volume 1, while making this material reasonably palatable (and I generally don't like watching violence). It also gives the movie a sort of surreal and twisted feel which makes the movie suprisingly engrossing. On the other hand, the plot and characters are relatively cartoonish (though the acting is solid), and I didn't really discern much deeper meaning in the movie, despite a total running time of about 4.5 hours. In short, this movie is entertaining in a way that might even tempt you to watch it more than once, but don't look for anything more than entertainment.",N/A
