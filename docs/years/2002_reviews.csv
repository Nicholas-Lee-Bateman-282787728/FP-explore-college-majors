661053,"Vatel, Fran?ois (fr&Scaron;Nsw&Scaron; v&Scaron;tl)(KEY), fl. 17th cent., French chef, famous in the time of Louis XIV. Mme Marie de S&#x17D;vign&#x17D;,in her letters, speaks of him as the chef of the prince of Cond&#x17D; and says that on a Friday, when the king was coming to dinnerand the fish failed to arrive in time, Vatel committed suicide. The authenticity of this story is doubtful.-The Columbia Encyclopedia, Sixth Edition.2001.Playwright/Screenwriter Tom Stoppard and Director Roland Joffe have taken the Francois Vatel of historical legend and turned him into aquintessential French hero in this fabulous looking but oddly soulless film.  In France in 1671, Louis XIV is King and, as Mel Brooks might say : ""It'sgood to be the King!"" Fab babes are always ready to get their freak on with you and your nobles will do anything to curry favor.  So when the Princede Conde is informed that Louis and his court will be coming to visit his estate , Chantilly, Conde tells his famed steward Vatel to pull out all thestops.  Perversely, Conde, who is in desperate need of money, will have to plunge himself even deeper into debt in the mere hope that Louis willchoose him to command the royal forces in the coming war with Holland.Given a blank check, Vatel proceeds to put on the most sumptuous and ornate feasting imaginable.  There's a moment early in the King's visit whereas the King walks through the garden the scenery rises, collapses, is rearranged and fits together again like pieces of an elaborate puzzle--by itself thisscene is worth the price of admission.  It is remarkable.  As the visit goes on, Vatel must improvise when shortages crop up, must respond to theextravagant requests of the various guests, and must navigate the petty jealousies of the spoiled visitors.  He gets himself in a real bind when hedallies with the beautiful and reserved Anne de Montausier (Uma Thurman) who is both the King's latest favorite and the object of desire of the nastyand vindictive Marquis de Lauzon (Tim Roth).The caged bird imagery that Mr. Joffe resorts to is a tad heavy-handed, but the film nicely captures the stratification of society (though that does makethe relationship between Vatel and Anne rather improbable) and shows the degree to which everyone is subject to the whims of the King, who canmake or break you with the wave of his hand.  Gerard Depardieu as Vatel is appealingly earnest and his total commitment to his work raises it to thelevel of artistry.  He is so decent, and the culture around him so indecent, that we can understand why Anne is attracted to him, even if we don'tbelieve they could have been friends given the circumstances of the day, let alone lovers.Then the story takes a couple of odd twists, one that seems to have been pilfered from Ruggles of Red Gap, as Conde loses Vatel to the King in acard game, then one which matches the fate of the historical Vatel but which occurs for precisely the opposite reason.  In real life Vatel supposedlykilled himself for failing to serve the King well, here he kills himself rather than serve the King at all.  That seems too much license to take withhistory.The film received a well-deserved Oscar nomination for Art Direction, but one wonders if so much energy went into the look of the movie that thefilmmakers lost track of the need to tell a compelling story along with the pretty pictures.  When the climactic scene of the film was going on it cameso suddenly and was shot so obliquely that, not knowing the background of the story,  I honestly didn't realize what had happened right away.  Thelogic they saw on their story boards didn't quite make it to the screen.  It's definitely worth seeing (and DVD is a must), but you can probably watchwith the sound off; it's intended to be looked at more than watched.GRADE : C+",Vatel

484037,"I suppose since I am pro-choice all the stuff on abortion in this movie really does not bother me at all.  This movie is definitely not for pro-lifers.  I agree with some of the other reviewers, Hollywood definitely has a political agenda that it puts forth in its movies, but I really don't see how that detracts from the movies all that much because I really liked this film very much.  I really like Tobey Maguire; I think he is a very good actor and his character, Homer Wells, is a very likeable young man that we want to see succeed in life as more than an apple picker, which makes the ending very satisfying for me in some regards.  The best part of the movie is definitely the beginning, which takes place in the orphanage, but I do think that it was really important for Homer to leave the orphanage and experience more of life.  The ending of the movie is bittersweet and kind of unrealistic, but this does not detract from the overall quality of this film.  Lasse Hallstrom is a wonderful director and I am a devoted fan of his movies.  Personally, I liked the movie because it raised some issues and made some arguments that pro-lifer's needed to hear.  Obviously, Hollywood's political agenda is going to make people mad when it disagrees with their political agenda.",The Cider House Rules VHS
690252,"I initially picked up A.D. Police, because I was bored, and wanted an anime series that was reasonablly priced.  I was'nt sure what to expect.  After the second episode, however, I was hooked.A.D. Police has a drawing quality, which makes you want to see it through to the end.  The two main characters, Kenji, and Klaif, have their share of differneces, which effects their role as partners.  Kenji is a loaner cold as ice type of guy.  WHile Klaif is a freindly type, who cna't remember his past.THe sereis takes some interesting twists and turns, as the two partners hunt Voomers (rouge robots) in the city of Genom.  THe setting is the near future, so don't expect a futuristic mech  type anime.  The series works well as is though.While the ending may not be a total surprise, you'll still want to see how everything turns out for the characters.A.D. Police is also a good value for a five hour anime.  If you're looking for a short, but good anime series at a resonable price, give A.D. Police a try.  You won't be disappointed.",N/A
689805,"Monster's Ball is a very intense movie. It garnished Hallie Berry with her Academy Award and I must admit she did a fantastic job, however this movie is not something I would see again. The performances are good and even Peter Boyle is a standout. Hallie tries hard and performs very well.Billy Bob Thorton is also a deep performer in this piece. Coupled with a really weird town and a really backwards thinking community - this movie shows the harsh realities of prejudice, love, hate and rivalry among a father who doesn't love his son and a son who loves his father.I wouldn't recommend this for the faint of heart and it has a real depressing theme - even Hallie's own child gets a strange twist. Overall the DVD doesn't have a lot of extra features but it does have few trailers of some better films. I was disappointed in this and wasn't quite expecting what I saw. I rented it because this is not a film I would buy.",Monster's Ball
537249,"A number of friends who saw and didn't rave about this movie wanted more of a documentary; a &quot;Tora! Tora! Tora!&quot; with modern special effects. I differ: I believe that each movie stands on its own, both technically, and, more importantly, as a story. I liked the earlier film, but its flaw was and is that it is more of a documentary. &quot;Pearl Harbor&quot; may well be a misnomer for a great story that goes well beyond December 7, 1941, but if you can set all that aside, this is, from almost all perspectives, a really good movie. The characters are believeable people experiencing real world problems, and one cannot help but be drawn into the drama thus created. Both male leads do very well, but I thought that special praise goes to Kate Beckinsale for portraying a young nurse who comes face to face with horrendous loss of life and injuries and, as a result, matures as a character from dilletant to combat nurse.  It's a great job of acting. The story of two young flyers starts in their boyhood and beginning careers as Army flyers (There was no US Air Force then, just the Army Air Corps). One (Ben Affleck) flys in the Battle of Britain and is believed killed; his friend ( Josh Hartnett) and his fiancee (Beckinsale) fall in love, and the dramatic tension occurs when Affleck surfaces alive and well. The special effects are fantastic; I never got the sense of a computer trying to fool me, although military historians will note that some of the ships that blow up could not have been at the real attack because their radar masts didn't exist then. But one can always nit pick at details. The fact is that &quot;Pearl Harbor&quot; has suffered somewhat in the press, but don't let that cause you to turn away from it. You are in for a stunning visual experience with this one. And visually and sonically it is all that we have come to expect of the DVD medium.",N/A

I also own the DVD of ""Pearl Harbor"" I feel that the computer graphics used to generate the attack scenes in ""Pearl"" are something that can't be equaled and must be seen to be believed, ""Tora"" give a much more detailed and accurate account of the events surrounding December 7, 1941. Since the first time that I saw Tora Tora Tora, I have always been fascinated by the degree of knowledge that the members of the military community in Washington D.C. had of the ""Surprise"" attack by The Japanese Empire. In conclusion, I highly recommend this movie to anyone who has an interest in the events of World War II.",N/A
140096,"How does one describe Blue Velvet? Disturbing, entertaining, romantic (yes, I did say romantic), mysterious, brilliant. Those words all describe Blue Velvet. This is a masterpiece of cinema. With all of David Lynch's brilliance, he has or may never touch a film this great again.Dennis Hopper. Why isn't this man in a category of the legends? Why isn't he revered as much as Pacino, DeNiro or Nicholson? Dennis Hopper can take the most wacked-out roles and transform them into legendary villains (Speed, Apocalypse Now).Kyle MacLachlan does an incredible job with his protagonistic role as does Laura Dern, playing the innocent virgin. Isabella Rossellini is also incredible as the victim, and there is always the cast of crazy characters David Lynch is famous for (Dean Stockwell, Jack Nance, to name a few). But the show is stolen by the script and cinematography. The scene of Dean Stockwell's lip sync is one of the greatest scenes in the history. It's why we have film. Plus, extra mention should me made about the score.Blue Velvet is not for the kids. It has graphic language, nudity and some violent moments not for the squeamish.

520411,"I would just like to start by saying the movie presented in this edition is splendid looking and sounding.The visuals are still stunningly clear and sound still makes me jump out of my seat. The second DVD on the other hand could have been left out. It is just a blantant marketing ploy trying to convince us to buy the video game, Enya's CD, Two Towers, and the extended version of the movie coming out on DVD in November. The two ""In-depth Documentary's"" were made for TV before the movie came out, basically for promotional purposes. One of which I had already seen on Sci-Fi. Knowing that an extended version would be released at a later date and already knowing the sub-par material I bought this edition anyway just because it is the only way to get the theatrical version. Knowing what I did i wasn't suprised at how bad the suplemental material was. I would have been happy if they would have put just a commentary and movie on one disc, but then again I love commentaries.As for the movie itself, it is a great action/fantasy/romance movie. If Tolkien could see this his only complaint would probably be more singing and for it to be longer. Its been along time since I've read the book so i'm not sure how much Jackson cut out but other than the noticable exclusion of Farmer Maggot and Tom Bombadil (sp?) it follows Tolkien's story pretty faithfully. I may get stoned by Tolkien and Peter Jackson fans alike for this comment but i would like to see another Lord of the Rings movie trilogy maybe animated. We need a quality animated version of the movie that maybe can be a little more faithful to the spirit of Tolkien.I bought this edition of the DVD on sale for [money] and i don't think i would spend much more than that for DVD without a commentary and a decent documentary. Once again, the movie is a great little escape into fantasy for three hours or so but it is obvious Jackson wants us to buy two different versions of this movie. And being the sucker I am, I probably will buy the extended version in November.",The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring

423244,"""Stagecoach"" is a landmark film in so many ways. While probably not the very best western ever created this stunning production is memorable as being one of the first of the genre where just as much emphasis was placed on character development as action. It also marked the breakthrough role (and first collaboration with frequent director Ford) for a young John Wayne after a decade of appearing in countless B films, and the first time that director John Ford used his most favourite location of Monument Valley, Utah for shooting which gives this film an almost out of this world ,mythical quality.Produced in the magical year of 1939 ""Stagecoach"" more than holds its own with all the other great classics produced in that year. Honoured with two Academy Awards for its musical score and the beautiful performance by Thomas Mitchell as the drunken doctor travelling on the stagecoach the film tells a very simple story of the intertwined lives of a group of people travelling through dangerous Indian territory on a stagecoach and how each effects the others lives in different ways. Ford assembled a sterling cast of performers here and apart from Wayne as the wrongly convicted  outlaw the Ringo Kid we have the before mentioned Thomas Mitchell (in the same year that he played Scarlett O'Hara's father in ""Gone With The Wind""), as the drunken doctor who is forced to deliver a baby on route, Claire Trevor in a superb performance as the ""scarlett lady"" Dallas, run out of town for her morals who forms an attachment to Wayne's character , Andy Devine as the coach driver and John Carradine as the shady gambler Hatfield. Donald Meek also registers as the fumbling spirits salesman who keeps having his samples raided by Mitchell. Louise Platt also does some memorable work as the very pregnant Lucy Mallory, travelling on the stagecoach to join her husband who gives birth during the journey and with help from Dallas learns a good lesson in understanding and tolerance of other's failings. ""B"" movie cowboy veteran Tom Tyler also makes a rare appearance as the Ringo Kid's nemesis Luke Plummer who is involved in a shoot out with Ringo at the finale.""Stagecoach"" contains many memorable moments, the most outstanding without a doubt being the lengthy and cleverly filmed Indian attack on route which contains some of the most amazing stunt work seen in films up till then. It is the work of stuntman genius Yakima Canutt who doubled for John Wayne in all the complicated action sequnces such as when the Ringo Kid takes control of the horses leading the stagecoach when it is attacked. These stunt scenes became re-used footage in countless westerns over the succeeding years so brilliant they were and are still considered.While not being a huge fan of the western genre I do love this film for its intelligent writing and attention to character development often not seen in alot of westerns. The beautiful location photography adds a tremendous boost to the overall look of the film and really sets the mood for the whole piece. It is such a landmark film in so many ways already mentioned however for sheer entertainment value for those that like action adventure tales it is unsurpassed. I dont feel you even need to be a western lover to enjoy it so well crafted are the characters and the action story that they are involved in. For stirring western excitement you can't go past John Ford's memorable classic ""Stagecoach"".",Stagecoach VHS
481977,"Want proof that this isn't a true sequel: Even Iron Monkey himself never dresses like he did in the first film.  Before he always had half his face covered, but now he does most his fighting in leisure suits with everyone seeing his face. Even the original music is absent, instead we get a musical score from the movie ""True Lies"" (I know, I own the soundtrack) during the action scenes, repeating the same string in one of the music tracks over and over (almost in every fight--at least at 5 different times!). In fact, besides dubbing in the use of the name ""Iron Monkey"" every once and a while, this is basically an older Donnie Yen movie re-released with the ""Iron Monkey 2"" label. Somebody tried way to hard to market in on the ""Iron Monkey"" name, and it shows quite badly.The only thing that made me keep watching was the frequent appearance of astonishing hyper-kinetic fight scenes choreographed by Yuen Ho-Ping, not the endlessly inventive Yuen Woo-Ping (as Amazon.com states), who came to fame as the fight choreographer of ""The Matrix."" Many people think that Woo-Ping did the fight choreography in this one... but he didn't. Those that have seen many of his other movies will notice the fight scenes lack a certain charisma that only Woo-Ping can deliver. Still, the curious thing is that, after a while, this choppy movie starts to lurch into a good-old kung fu spectacle. Iron Monkey 2 grows strangely compelling. It's as if, through directorial incompetence, the movie has been distilled to the basic elements of cinematic storytelling.This is not Yuen Woo-Ping's work, but I believe you may find it worth it because of Donnie Yen, who many believe is up there in on screen-fighting-fireworks with the likes of Jet Li and Jackie Chan. The other highlight in this movie was the actor who portrayed the son looking for his father --he had incredible martial arts skills in his own right. His fight with Donnie Yen was arguably one of the better ones in the film. The one bad thing was that we get more fighting from this looking-for-father guy than Donnie Yen himself. He's not a bad fighter, but I bought the movie looking for most of the fights with the Iron Monkey himself involved.By itself, you have some good fighting with some really bad dubbing and a reused music track from the movie ""True Lies."" But when you slap the name of the sequel to one of Yuen Woo-Ping's best work to it, too many comparisons will be made.",Iron Monkey 2
88838,"When Exorcist hit the big screen in the seventies, audiences around the nation waited in lines around the block to get into theatres everywhere. This movie revolted, facsinated, and flat out scared the hell out of them, and most of them loved it! The rest either fled the theatre in sheer terror, or became sick, and went home to turn on all the lights, and head straight for church the next AM. Wow. What a movie, and a stroke of brilliant filmmaking, to get an audience to behave as such. There are many subtle scenes that may escape those who only want to see head spinning and green pea soup. Such as the young priest's disturbing dreams about his mother. Young Regan fooling around with an Ouija Board, or the nasty demonic visage that keeps popping it's face throughout the possessed house. Regan eventually transforms into one of the most terrifying monsters in cinematic history. Her possessed 12 yr. old girl character is demonic, vile and pure evil. One can almost feel the chill in her room, or smell her repulsiveness. Dr. Billy Graham himself admitted that the film had a sense of real evil to it. The reason it scares us is fear of the unknown. If one is strictly an atheist, then it is sheer nonsense. But if one has faith in God, or any gods, then possession is a VERY real reality. The fact that the film's screenplay was based on a real story that happened in the Midwest in the fifties, only adds to the sense of dread and terror that one feels alone at night after viewing this movie. Throughout history, and in the Bible there are many mentions of demonic possession. If these instances werent mere seizures, or mental illness, then perhaps the horror that Linda Blair portrays is chillingly real.",N/A

How can you go wrong with [bad] ET ripoff?Here's the story:A group of really bad and argumentative musicians decide to go on vacation to some place that is mountainous and always shrouded in fog.  They end up taking a groupie along with them whom everyone (especially the other women in the group) hates.  At the same time, a trio of stupid poachers, consisting of Lorne Green, Norm Abrahams and a Rennaissance Festival leather mug-maker investigate a meteor that hit the ground near there.  The meteor turns out to be a ship (i guess it was a ship, even though the budget, apparently, wouldn't allow for one to be shown) loaded with eggs that hatch into a cross between ET and snuffelupaguss.  Norm Abrahams smashes a bunch of the eggs, which causes an adult alien to kill him and hunt down his buddies.  Meanwhile, a young, insect-collecting boy finds one of the eggs and decides to hatch it in his bed (ewwww!).  The musicians find themselves at the boy's house eventually, after causing the death of the groupie that went with them.  Well, the egg hatches, and the alien, whom the boy calls Trumpy, is actually very nice, but his magic act [is bad].  However, his relative who killed the poachers isn't nearly as friendly, and sets about killing the musicians and the boy's curmudgeon of an uncle.  Finally, the kid sends Trumpy packing into the forest because he knows that humans and trunked aliens cannot live in peace.Man, this movie is REALLY bad.  But Joel and the Bots make it fun.

In the first, she's a prim college professor who's really a witch/succubus with a taste for turning the tables on amorous young men. The second has her as a spinster with a split personality---allowing her to play ""two"" roles. And the last is the now famous Zuni fetish doll story that has the doll coming to life and terrorizing her all over her apartment. She's a lonely career woman dominated by her mother and the ending has her possessed by the spirit of the doll waiting for mama to come over. A great ending. The movie is Black's show all the way.

701762,"I went into this movie as a lover of the Escaflowne series, but I knew not to set my expectations too high.  I read the reviews and most people said that it is best if you take the movie on its own terms without comparing it to the series.Well I have to admit, that's a little hard to do.  People who have seen the series will be absolutely flabbergasted that their favorite characters and storyline have been butchered into something boderline incoherent.  People who haven't seen the show will likely be very confused and bored by the storyline which seems to cram way to much into too little time (hardly a surprise considering the source material).Although I didn't really care for the character redesigns, I have to say that visually Escaflowne is a spectacular movie.  The opening scene where Van bisects the crew of an airship is worth a rental at least.  The problem is that the creators forgot what made Escaflowne the series so special to begin with.  It wasn't the animation, the giant Gymelfs or even the storyline (although it was excellent).  No, Escaflowne's biggest appeal was the endearing characters, especially Van, Hitomi and Folken.  The problem with the movie is that I actually detested the characters movie counterparts as they exhibited exactly none of the facination of the series.So what are we left with here?  A boring movie with stale dialogue, uninteresting characters and an absolute affront to fans of the TV show that has some remarkably stunning visuals.  Would I recommend it?  No, visuals alone do not make a movie and if you liked the Escaflowne series even a little bit then you probably don't want to see this movie as it will likely leave a very bitter taste in your mouth over all the wasted potential that is here.",N/A

I do like Grace Kelly very much. She was a beautiful woman, and I loved her strange way of talking. So I liked seeing her and of course the diamond (it was quite impressive), but as for the rest of the movie, it was a real bore. I do not care for Frank Sinatra, Bing is okay, but there was too much singing and the songs weren't even good in my opinion. I felt the script was very loose and vague, and all along I kept wondering, ""when is the ACTION going to happen?""  It also seemed a bit silly as well. I don't go for such lightweight fair, no matter who is in it. As I said, I was glad to see Grace Kelly, but I will never watch this again.

574327,"A cabana boy (Joseph Feinnes) falls in love with a married woman (Gretchen Mol) who is staying at the vacation resort that employs him along with her politically powerful husband (Ray Liota). After a little maneuvering the cabana boy seduces the married woman and then inserts his jade stem in her jade passageway followed by tearful farewells and her inevitable return home. Consumed by passion the cabana boy follows her to Yonkers New York where he continues to park his jizzm wagon in her love garage until her husband gets wind of things and warns him to stay away. Upon failing to heed this advice, cabana boy is shot and left for dead, but as luck would have it, he survives with his head conveniently disfigured beyond recognition. In the spirit of Monte Christo, cabana boy takes a few years off to build a new identity complete with wealth and powerful fiscal/criminal credentials before returning to the Empire State to obtain vengeance and to reclaim the object of his desires. In case it isn't patently clear what he's up to, he takes the name ""Esquema"" and a fake South American (but not Brazilian) accent. Cabana boy insinuates himself in the husband's life, solves his racketeering problems and then demands his wife as payment. Before you can say, ""what is the point of revealing yourself if you're not going to kill him"", cabana boy seduces the wife again and runs off with her. The couple spend an idyllic night in the country during which cabana boy repeatedly inserts his splutter plug into the wife's love socket before the husband catches up to them and shoots cabana boy in the morning. During the inconclusive ambulance ride in which we guess that cabana boy will either wind up dead or further disfigured/disguised, the wife reminds him of how they first met.Oddly enough, this film is so wretchedly bad that it's good. ""Forever Mine"" is poorly done to the point of being wildly entertaining. How Joseph Feinnes and Ray Liota got roped into this film is beyond me. Even more puzzling is how Ray Liota who electrified audiences with his portrayal of visceral villains in ""Something Wild"" and ""Good Fellows"" managed to play such an incompetent bad guy in this film.

374408,"I consider this one of the best films ever made and unarguably one of the most unforgettable; the opening scene is proof of that. This is based on the true life story of a New Zealand murder/matricide that shocked the world and it is directed by the genius Peter Jackson, who obviously insists on leaving a haunting impact on the viewer. The story follows two highly imaginative girls who're outcasts but when they meet they form an obsessive--though beautiful-- bond, creating an imaginary world only they can share, completely shutting out everyone and everything else around them. When their parents discover the intensity of their relationship, they threaten to tear them apart, causing the girls to plot the unthinkable. Both Winslet and Lynskey are mesmerizing as the beyond creative and imaginative duo who simultaneously manage to delight and frighten us with utmost perfection. They are able to move us with their dedicated affection for one another while also provoking a bit of uneasiness in us, afraid of what they're going to do next. The story is beautiful, haunting, suspenseful, thrilling, and nothing short of awe-inspiring and I highly reccommend it to anyone with a touch of creativity in them!!",Heavenly Creatures VHS

204442,"History buffs, lovers of Tudor England, and historical dramas in general could not help but be impressed by this magnificent production that is rich in detail, characterisation, historical research and perfect contemporary backdrops. I know it has always been an absolute favourite of mine among all the fine historical films produced in the late 1960's and early 1970's.""Anne Of The Thousand Days"" despite a few strayings from the historical truths, at times is a painstakingly researched production that tries to always be as accurate as possible in its retelling of the tragic rise and fall of the fascinating Anne Boleyn, second wife of King Henry VIII. Tudor England was a time of great beauty, savagery, religious upheaval and pagentry and this is all captured beautifully in this film. Indeed ""Anne Of The Thousand Days"" is a visual and indeed intellectual feast for the eyes and the brain. Towering above the whole massive production here is Genevieve Bujold in the role of a life time as Anne Boleyn. Never has she been so perfectly cast as here. During the course of the film she develops from the simple girl just arrived back in England from her time at the stylish French court, who catches the eye of the England's august and rather frightening monarch, to that of  being England's Queen who must live by her own wits alone if she is to survive in such unsure times. It is a stunning performance filled with equal amounts of fire, passion, sorrow, wit and spirit. The character of Anne is well researched here and Bujold rightly won an Academy Award Nomination for her performance here. Richard Burton had his last real stand out role as Henry VIII in this production. Many famous actors have portrayed Henry on stage and screen and Keith Michell's superb portrayal of the king was still ahead in the future when this film was made. Burton is wonderfully believable as Henry and fits the part like a glove with equal parts, majestic presence, selfishness, cruelty and great passion, just how this most famous of monarch's is envisioned. Burton also received an Academy Award Nomination for his colourful and beautifully balanced performance and his Henry has rightly joined the few who are deservedly remembered for their portrayals, Charles Laughton and Keith Michell in particular.""Anne Of The Thousand Days' is rich in wonderful performances from Michael Hordern and Katherine Blake as Thomas and Elizabeth Boleyn, Anne's parents to Anthony Quayle in a superb performance of world weary splendour as the infamous Cardinal Wolsey. William Squire as Thomas More and Joseph O'Conor as Archbishop Fisher, two men bound up in all the tragic tumult of Henry's Reformation and who were sacrificed for Anne's sake also excel. Irene Papas portrays Henry's first wife Catherine of Aragon and while her very dark appearance perhaps fails to match the Red/Gold hair and pale complexion of the real Catherine, she is very impressive in her brief scenes as Henry's cast off wife who fought him all the way by refusing to grant him the divorce he eagerly sought thus bringing on the English Reformation. In a small but standout role Valerie Gearon plays Mary Boleyn, Anne's older sister and former mistress of Henry. While their relationship was historical fact in the film she is portrayed carrying Henry's child. That fictional development aside her's is a wonderful performance filled with the anger and uselessness felt by many women in the man's world of Tudor England.The film is full of wonderful moments. Two standouts are Anne's triumphal procession through London where she is greeted by the jeers and insults of an outraged population who thought of her as a whore and her final speech to Henry in the Tower (fictional but carried of with finesse) prior to her execution where she gives nothing away to him and declares that ""her blood will be well spent"" and predicts that ""her daughter (Elizabeth) will become a greater Queen than England has ever known. Stirring stuff and Genevieve Bujold makes the most of such a juicy part. The period flavour is caught beautifully and for all its brutality the Tudor period was sumptous in costumes, interior decoration, garden design etc. These are all faithfully reproduced in ""Anne Of The Thousand Days"" to maximum effect and the film is a gorgeous feast for the eyes.For any student of Tudor history this film is a must see. I love it for its sterling attempt within the confines of popular entertainment to tell the story as it was. Production values are top notch and one feels the spirit of that young Boleyn girl who unwillingly found herself thrust into the historical spotlight, and who  became a woman in the process, in each frame of Bujold's performance.",N/A

259543,"Each time I watch this wonderful movie about the shades of gray we use to cement together the brickwork of our lives, I think of James Stewart's comment in the trailer at the beginning of the movie as he describes doing the original play on the road, when invariably some kid in the audience would loudly ask, ""Where's the rabbit""? Where is he indeed! I wanna see the damned rabbit, too!  Yet this thought-provoking parable about what is real and what isn't and the shades of each we use to try to live our lives as best we can, remains one of the all-time favorites of people who love to watch movies.James Stewart portrays Elwin P. Dowd as a more than slightly-tipsy drinker who happens to enjoy the company of his constant company Harvey, a six-foot- something invisible (and imaginary?)  rabbit. Now all of the terrific character actors in the film are of one opinion or another about the rabbit, but all agree that Dowd is an altogether pleasant man who everyone enjoys having around. Yet his incessant and insistent ramblings about Harvey make him an embarrassment, and some of them are honestly concerned about him. So what to do about Elwin? And what do you think about the rabbit?As for me, I prefer to think the rabbit is real, but chooses to be invisible. More interesting that way. And you have to admit the porch swing does rock without anyone else on it in the last scene, after all. I've tried the rabbit routine a few times when in a particularly whimsical mood, and it always brings smiles and conversation. So what's wrong with having a big albeit invisible rabbit as a drinking chum? A guy could do a lot worse. See the movie; it is a bona-fide classic. I have to give this one two thumbs WAY UP!

520924,"15 years from now, people are going to pick up this movie and wonder why so many people thought it was bad--there's actually very little wrong with it: memorable performances from Sizemore, Stamp and Kilmer, better science than the average Hollywood flick, a nifty mystery, a logical triumph of man over machine (aren't we all a little tired of omnipotent, indestructible robots?), and crisp suspense as the astronauts race the clock to escape the tightening noose of a mission gone awry.It was promoted as a SF/Horror flick similar to ALIEN, and it really isn't--it's more like Alfred Hitchcock directing THE RIGHT STUFF.All the SF movie fans I know tend to like byzantine tales, historic in scope, filled with quirky characters roaming rich new landscapes, so this simple tale of a small group of men trying to escape a desolate red planet within a short span of hours might not be rich enough for them. (The SF fanboys won't like it because Carrie-Anne Moss's shower scene is too short and doesn't show enough...er...Moss.)It's definitely worth a rental, but you won't want to own it unless you're a suspense fan that revels more in how a film is put together than in how it turns out.",N/A
52872,"Everybody knows what Conan is about, so I won't bore you with that. What I *will* say is that this is some sort of director's cut, with several scenes in it I'd never seen before (and I'm a die-hard Conan fangirl). The scenes help the movie considerably. There are a few deleted scenes regarding King Osric included as freebies and a little deleted scene of the director as a peasant selling Conan lizard-on-a-stick in Zamora, but these are fribble and not in the actual movie. The included scenes include a vastly expanded role for Osric's daughter (didn't you wonder why she even got billing? In the VHS edition she gets about as much screen time and dialog as the half-naked sacrificial victim in the Tower where the jewel was) and some explanatory stuff that helped the movie flow better. I can't imagine why they were cut to begin with, but they made the movie as fresh to watch this time as it was the first time I saw it.There's some &quot;making of&quot; stuff that was fun to watch, some stuff we'd seen before and lots of new stuff -- a very frail Max von Sydow talking about how he took the role of Osric because his kid was into the comics, a suprisingly mature Sandahl Bergman talking about how her finger got severed during a fight scene, the composer telling how he composed Valeria's funeral song after a terrible nightmare about his own family dying... The director also explains how he decided upon his cast, which was neat, and set producers and animal handlers talk about their particular challenges. I'd never seen or heard most of this before, so that was interesting. The &quot;archives&quot; show onsite photos and drawings and whatnot, which didn't do a ton for me but which others might find interesting. A small bio of whatshisname who wrote the Conan books is given.I already owned this on VHS, and bought the DVD because I was afraid my tape was wearing out. I'm glad I got it.

161025,"This is a movie that, if memory serves, performed less than spectacularly at the box office.  I suppose the reason for this is that when people go to see a movie about Robin Hood, they generally want to see swashbuckling action, topped off with a happy ending where good triumphs. That's what viewers of Robin Hood movies have been used to ever since Errol Flynn swung a sword in the role.  This movie, on the other hand, features relatively little action, and a distinctly tragic ending (it's also the only screen treatment of the character I know of that portrays a variant of the actual legend of Robin's end, and the arrow shot blindly to mark the site of his grave).  Instead of an upbeat, good-triumphs-over-evil swashbuckler, which most Robin Hood movies are, ""Robin and Marian"" is melancholy character study with a rather tragic ending.  I think this left moviegoing audiences feeling a bit let down when the film debuted, and resulted in a relatively poor box office performance.But since then, many people have come to appreciate the movie for its considerable artistic merits.  I have always loved this movie, and for many of the reasons already listed by other reviewers.  It has a truly inspired cast, a tremendously moving ending, the chemistry between the two leads is extraordinary, and the movie presents a new and interesting take on some of the classic characters of English folklore.What really stands out for me though is the late Robert Shaw's brilliant performance as the Sheriff of Nottingham.  This is the only time I have ever seen the character portrayed on screen as anything other than a throughly contemptible villain.  The Sheriff has been seen as everything from the greedy, rapacious robber baron of the old British ""Robin of Sherwood"" TV series, to the over-the-top, caricature of evil portrayed by Alan Rickman in ""Robin Hood: Prince of Thieves"".  In this movie, Shaw shows us a very believable, and very human Sheriff.He's obviously cleverer than Robin, and it's also obvious that he truly respects his old adversary.  A really touching scene is when the Sheriff warns Robin not to interfere and try to rescue Marian from the fate she has chosen for herself.  It's clear he doesn't at all want to be Robin's enemy again.  In another scene, he actually laments the death of one of his soldiers - something no other actor's Sheriff would have done in a million years.  This Sheriff is actually a rather likeable figure in his way, and if he's a bad guy, it's only because he is a creature of duty and is determined to carry out the orders of his king, even when the king is an unworthy master.It's fascinating to see such a human portrayal of the Sheriff, to match the realistic human portrayals all the other actors bring to their characters.  This is really one of the most underrated pictures out there.  I highly recommend it.",N/A
82911,"Here we have one of the funniest, most creative and original, and genuinely emotional animated films that has EVER been created, and this pretentious ""Watchman-on-the-Wall"" person has the nerve to put it down for elements that don't even figure into it.  ""Lilo & Stitch"" is the only movie I have ever seen that makes me cry literally from beginning to end; half the time because it's just that charming and funny, and the other half the time because the themes of love, loyalty, and family are SO beautifully and tenderly conveyed.  Right from the film's opening credits sequence you will surely have tears in your eyes from the sheer beauty of the Hawaiian musical numbers and the open affection of the filmmakers for the Hawaiian culture.  On a character note, Lilo has perhaps more depth than any animated character I've ever seen.  Her eccentricities and emotional baggage make her, by turns, delightfully charming and totally heartbreaking.  Stitch is, hands-down, the most original and entertaining animated character I have EVER seen, and so long as he is on the screen, I am having the BEST time with all of his fantastically wonderful random movements and noises.  ""Lilo & Stitch"" also deserves kudos for having the courage to be so modern in its handling of such important real-life issues as broken familes and Departments of Child Welfare.  This is an absolutely brilliant and deeply moving little film that deserves FAR better than the lazy, cheesy direct-to-video sequel and TV series that are already in the works, and my only wish at this point is that Disney would treat their finest properties with enough reverence and respect to give them the better-thought-out *theatrical* sequel treatment they so strongly deserve.  I may not pay much attention to the forthcoming direct-to-video ""Stitch: The Movie,"" but ""Lilo & Stitch"" is one movie that I personally cannot WAIT to add to my personal DVD collection... it has entertained and moved me more thoroughly than any other movie I have had the privelige of seeing this year!

683581,"Chances are, if you're considering this DVD purchase, then you're familiar with Michael Moore.  The renegade filmmaker behind Roger and Me returns for the second season of his Emmy-nominated documentary TV show &quot;The Awful Truth.&quot;  It ran on Bravo! in the summer of 2000, and Moore returns to his familiar Times Square setting for more of his guerilla-style harassment of all things nasty.Moore's satirical fist knows no friends: he takes stabs at both major political parties (note to Conservatives: just because he bashes you doesn't mean he doesn't bash Liberals, too!), goes after screwy judicial systems, the mainstream media, religious nutjobs, and even himself.  Some of his stunts include driving a taxi in New York that refuses to pick up white people, sending a pimp to Congress (to make the point that politicians who whore out votes in exchange for campaign contributions are &quot;hos&quot;), importing Iraqi gas and selling it for 60 cents a gallon, and a new short film: Ficus, in which he runs a ficus plant for an uncontested Congress nomination (and, by all counts, WINS).  This season is much more hit-and-miss than the first season, with some episodes, like the pimp, worth watching over and over, while others are pretty darn boring.  But, all in all, there's certainly enough here to justify this 2-disc set.The video is presented in crisp full-frame, which makes sense because most of it was shot digitally.  The sound mix is a strong DD 2.0, standard TV-show fare - there isn't enough here to really rock the old subwoofer anyway, and the mix is more than adequate.  The only extras are some Bookie segments that didn't appear on TV, and Michael Moore's commentary on four of the episodes.  His commentary is hilarious and informative, which is generally what I'd expect from Mike.  The only disappointment is that Awful Truth episodes ran 60 seconds longer in the UK, and it would have been cool to see that extra footage, but hey, it's a minor complaint.So sit back, pop in this DVD, and get ready to think.  Rather than succumb to the fallacies of those he satirizes, by offering easy, cookie-cutter, bumper-sticker answers, Moore is content raising questions and letting us work through them on our own.  It's a sign of maturity, intellect, and a true desire to change the world: people are more apt to work for themselves when they figure out the answers to problems on their own, instead of listening to MSNBC, chubby radio talk-show hosts, or the 700 club for the &quot;cheat-sheet&quot; solutions.

708003,"After a few months of waiting, I finally checked out ""Queen of the Damned"" for myself. I really didn't have the time to see it in the theater. But now that I have seen it, let me just say that this is the best Anne Rice adaption that I've seen  since her first film adaption from her ""Vampire Chronicles"" series, ""Interview with the Vampire"" back in 1994! But, there is also another side to the film as well...and that is to remember the late, great songstress Aaliyah (""Romeo Must Die""), who died so tragically in that horrible plane crash after filming this movie. I think that she was either 22 or 23 when it happened. To me, ""Queen of the Damned"" is not really a sequel, but more of a continuation as to what happened at the end of ""Interview with the Vampire"" involving the vampire Lestat (who was played by superstar Tom Cruise at the time). ""Queen of the Damned"" focuses once again on Lestat (Now portrayed by Stuart Townsend, ""Shooting Fish""), who awakens after his 100-year slumber only to find himself among a new trend in the world...the world of rock music. And so, Lestat finds acceptance in a tattooed and pierced world by reinventing himself as a rock star. And Lestat becomes an overnight sensation around the world, etc. Meanwhile, his intoxicating Goth-riffed sound waves not only awakens the almighty Queen of the Vampires, Akasha (Aaliyah), but his sound also rekindles Akasha's desires as well, which is simply...to rule once again! And to also have Lestat rule by her side as well! Unless an elite few can stop Akasha's reign, everyone, even vampires, in the whole world is doomed! In conclusion, ""Queen of the Damned"" is in the same scary and gothic spirit as any other horror flick that I've seen, but better! I now own the DVD version of the film which includes tons of extras such as a many number of featurettes (including a featurette that pays tribute to the beloved Aaliyah), 13 deleted scenes, 3 full-length Lestat music videos as they were performed in the film, extended Death Valley concert sequences, theatrical trailer, and DVD-ROM features. And also, in conclusion, this film has not only two great performances from both Stuart Townsend and Aaliyah, but also an excellent supporting cast including Marguerite Moreau (""Firestarter: Rekindled""), Vincent Perez (""The Crow: City of Angels""), and Lena Olin (""Romeo is Bleeding""), as well as an incredible storyline, and a great soundtrack to add!

Now I'm something of an anomaly in my family, because all the otherGuys'n'Gals did devour this trilogy. So really, for someone who never read it, I've certainly heard enough about it over the years. I know character and place names, the way children sometime pick up details about the parents' childhoods through hearing twicetold tales.Twenty years ago, I saw the lambasted cartoon version of LofR. Well, contrary to what so many have said--I don't see the difference between the two! I mean, that wasn't SO bad, but this is not at ALL as good as I was led to believer. Don't get me wrong, I wanted to like this movie badly: after all, threee hours is quite an investment of one's time. But I felt cold and unaffected by the goings-on. Probably didn't help that I was there on an unsatisfactory date, either. But all the more reason to escape into fantasy, you see!And the one detail that annoyed me more than anything else, was this: There are SO many scenes of an outstretched palm on which the ring is sitting. Every single palm--and there were several that had a go at this--was filthy dirty. One friend countered and said that I had to understand that folks were on this journey and would of course get dirty.

513279,"The Film:Positively unique. While I see parallels between Run Lola Run and its 1999 counterpart, Fight Club, the instances are only fleeting and probably have more to do with the fact that I saw the two films shortly after one another than they do with actual similarities. Or perhaps it's how both films have taken a novel idea and let it run its course, flaws and all, producing something that's much stronger when all's said and done.If the stranger who brushed past you this morning had walked an extra couple inches to their left, what kind of an effect do you think it might have had on the rest of your life? If the film is to be trusted, a bit more than you'd think. One woman, mere scenery in any other film, goes from lotto winner to baby stealer to bible pusher after her chance meetings with Lola. And that's where the real strength lies here. More than anything else, Run is a story about everyday lives, and how conceivably miniscule changes can alter an entire lifetime. Despite the imaginative camera angles and Quentin Tarantino meets Guy Ritchie storyline, the real focus of the movie is the interaction with the regular Joe, and the ultimate result of that interaction.Sure, there are some scenes I'd have done differently. But like they say, hindsight is 20 / 20 and everybody's the world's finest director from their couch (or, in this case, from behind their monitors). Some transitions are awkward, but the characters are there in full force, and the possibly-complicated plot is handled to perfection. Add to that the list of risky camera tricks that paid off in spades, and you've got a healthy package. Highly Recommended.9 / 10DVD Extras:Not exactly a stack of bonus features, but those that are present really do pack a punch. First, and most notably, is the option to watch the film in English or original German with English subtitles... which, if you've ever heard the American voice actors, you'll know isn't really that much of an option. Put plainly, the English dub blows. Go for German with the subtitles, and enjoy the original vocal inflections in all their glory.You also get a feature-length commentary from writer / director / producer Tom Tykwer and Lola herself, actress Franka Potente. This one's a real goldmine, if you're into insightful audio commentary, as the two reveal bits and pieces the uneducated eye would have blown past without a second thought. Honestly, the definition of what a DVD commentary track should be.Finally, there are the prerequisite Theatrical Trailers, which are nothing extraordinary, and a music video from the picture's phenomenal soundtrack. Again, nothing special... mostly just Potente mouthing along to the words of one of the few songs with a vocal track, screaming, and looking a bit bizarre without the bright red hair. It's no surprise the single never really shook the charts.Worth the extra bucks to pick up on DVD, without a doubt. Hell, they could've just given it the German dub and I would've been happy, but the audio commentary makes it all that much nicer.7 / 10",N/A

298493,"One of the few good things about &quot;Fantasia 2000&quot; is that after I saw it, it compelled me to dig out the original Fantasia and watch it again. I fell in love with it all over again. When I first saw it in 1990 at its theatrical re-release, I was only 8 years old. Ten years later, in 2000, I had taken up the violin and I was about to graduate from high school. Watching this film with a new appreciation for classical music that I didn't have in 1990, this film inspired me to stick with the violin and pursue a music major. Another thing that changed when I watched it again in 2000, was my view on the final segment, Night on Bald Mountain and Ave Maria. Today it is my favorite segment of Fantasia. Fantasia's presentation of &quot;Ave Maria&quot; is one of the most spiritually uplifting endings in the history of cinema. The music in this segment is just gorgeous. It showed me that music can have an impact and that it is just as important as any other form of entertainment.Of coarse, it wouldn't be fair not to list some of the other highlights of this film. Highlights include J.S. Bach's &quot;Toccata and Fugue in D minor&quot; which shows off the orchestra and then dissolves into an abstract dream with flashes of light and flying bows and quaking landscapes, Beethoven's &quot;Pastoral symphony&quot; which is a pretty accurate perception of Greek Mythology, except for the centaurettes. Those are purely Disney's idea. Then we have &quot;The Dance of the Hours&quot; Fantasia's funniest and second-most famous (next to the `Sorcerer's Apprentice') this segment features dancing hippos, elephants, ostriches and alligators throughout the coarse of a day from morning to the afternoon, then into the evening and night. This is shown through some very beautiful animation. Sense I was only 8 when I saw this the first time, I was mainly focusing on the cartoon part of it, and the quality of animation made me think it was a new release, and not a 50 year old classic.Forget Fantasia 2000. This movie is the real deal.",Fantasia Walt Disney's Masterpiece  VHS
155755,THis entry in the Candyman series is actually not as bad as one may think.  This time the story revolves around a woman (as usual) who is a direct decndent of the cnadyman.  She doesn't know this at first.  SHe finds out more about this after her brother is arrested blaming the Candyman for the crimes.  The woman summons him sometime along the lines and he is going about the task of seducing her and taking her back with him.

475220,"One of the biggest surprises in '99, this superbly crafted film was majorly overlooked.  The plot is a conventional one but shot and edited brilliantly by Steven Soderbergh from a screenplay by Lem Dobbs.It follows an english ex-con named Wilson (played wonderfully by Terence Stamp) and his quest for vengeance for the murder of his daughter.  Soderbergh and Dobbs' commentary on the DVD is worth the price..  they give an amazing insight into the situations and the overall editing style that makes this movie so interesting to watch.This movie also features a very oddball but amusing cast of supporting actors like Peter Fonda, Leslie Ann Warren and Luis Guzman.Another real interesting note about this movie is how they convinced director Ken Loach to lend them footage from an older film showing a younger Terence Stamp, to integrate with Wilson's ongoing character development.Like modern noir-ish classics like Memento and Insomnia (the original version), The Limey is both entertaining and thought provoking and keeps the audience within it's reach.",The Limey

The group becomes trapped and, one by one, the supporting cast members fall prey to nasty bugs of all shapes and sizes.  Genre veteran Jack Shoulder (Alone in the Dark, The Hidden, and A Nightmare on Elm Street 2: Freddy's Revenge) keeps the pace swift and tension passable.  This movie won't win any awards, but it's a nifty little addition to the creature feature genre.",Arachnid

But the minute the movie came on, my previous thoughts faded and I never left my chair for a second. That's the effect a movie like Red Dragon had on me.  Edward Norton was a wonderful pick for this movie.  His chemistry with Hopkins easily rivaled Foster's.  Ralph Fiennes in my opinion though was the show stealer.  His acting was so convincing that you could almost feel sorry for him and what he was which was a killer ruled by pain and suffering.  For people who thought that the series went downhill after ""Hannibal"", do yourself a favor and see Red Dragon.  Like I said, I liked Hannibal, but Red Dragon shuts the door on it.",N/A

Most notably the main character, Jack Skelington - The Pumpkin King, who is in charge of the yearly preparations for Halloween. One day, Jack stumbles into Christmas Town, a world much more colorful and cheery than his own.

Jack is a sweet skeleton with his heart is in the right place, however...........well, you can imagine.The time and effort taken to create the stop-motion animation in NBC is mind-boggling. I still can't figure out how they created some of the effects.  This is one of those films that commands repeat viewing. I've watched the DVD several times and I always see something new that I hadn't caught before. The attention to detail is magnificent.NBC is a little off the beaten path (it's rated PG), however keep in mind that even though Santa Clause (&quot;Sandy Claws&quot;) is kidnapped and held hostage, the movie has a happy ending.The DVD picture and sound quality (Dolby Digital and DTS) are absolutely marvelous, and the disk is loaded with tons of wonderful extras.",Tim Burton's The Nightmare Before Christmas VHS
669484,"Anyone who's a big fan of blues-rock or guitar-hero rock of the sixties and seventies should get a huge thrill out of this gem. It begins with scenes of the sea thrusting into the Irish coast and then makes its way into a spellbound onstage version of 'Walk On Hot Coals'. Rory Gallagher was definitely the most under-rated blues-rock guitarist of all time; this DVD is proof of it. His style and tone are both blustery and unrefined, but natural and brown-toned as well. His band of himself on vocal and guitar (mainly a strat player), Gerry McAvoy (bass), Lou Martin (piano), and Rod de'Ath (drums), is loud and raw blues-rock heaven. The backstage interviews are interesting, too, as they show how electrified and personable he was. It's blatantly obvious how much he loved playing live by the huge smile on his face and the way he interacts with the crowd. The scenes of Belfast and the rough old Irish nightclubs and venues just add to the raw beauty of the music. This one will be all worn out by the time I'm done watching it and listening to it. It's one of my favorite DVDs.",Rory Gallagher - Irish Tour 1974

674186,"This is another film that has been touted as the next ""Beautiful Thing,"" but it was not the director's intention to make a love story like that.  Rather, this is a series of snapshots of a few days in the lives of two Spanish boys who are heading down different forks in the road.  Though clocked at 90 minutes the movie speeds by in seemingly half that time.Nico is coming to visit Dani at the coast while Dani's parents are away; he is intending to do the same thing he would do if he stayed home in Barcelona, went to Rome, or, for that matter, orbited in the Space Shuttle:  chase skirts.  Dani has begun to hear the tapping of a different drummer and has apparently had a lot of time to plan all the ways he wants to share his new interests with his long time pal.  Clearly these two have been very close.  Krammpack (mutual masturbation), the original title of the play, is not just something they've read about in magazines.The movie is a series of fast moving vignettes of the two boys and the two girls they meet and interact with.  They move from incident to incident quickly, not lingering long nor introspecting much about what has happened.  Though the age of the two is not clear (I've read as young as 15, as old as 17) it is made clear they are both virgins and minors (in much of Europe, 16 is the age of consent).There are some unsettling undertones as Dani experiments with sexuality, mas or menos, oblivious for some time to the fact Nico is increasingly uncomfortable with the moves he is putting on him.  There is a very unsettling, for me, date rape scene, involving the hoary old concoction Spanish Fly, not the modern date rape drug DHA.  The movie remains non-judgemental.  Director Cesc Gay keeps things from getting too heavy both by not lingering on any one incident and with musical punctuation and title cards reminscent of silent films that foreshadow upcoming scenes.  The music in the film is excellent.Nico is played by Jordi Villachi and he is a real charmer.  Though not blessed with extraordinary good looks, it is nevertheless easy to see why Dani and Elena and Berta are drawn to him.  Dani is a very handsome young man, played by Fernando Ramalla with an intensity that is at times eerie.  He is struggling with more difficult issues than Nico, of course, and has anticipated that he is facing almost certain frustration of his desires.When the two go their separate ways one evening Dani, in a lover's snit, tries tarting an older man, which is a cake walk for him, but the better angels of his nature prevail.The movie ends positively; the two's friendship survives the stresses.  Nobody is thrown into therapy nor denounced from the pulpit for their misdeeds.  Nico hasn't given up on chasing skirts and Dani has learned a lot about what he wants, as well as what he doesn't want.  The worst that Nico can bring himself to say of his friend is that he is selfish.I gave the movie four stars but if the system would have let me, I would have given it another 1/4 or 1/2 star, and if it continues to wear well with repeated viewing, as I think it will, I'll be upgrading my rating in a few months.  Nico and Dani is not ""Romeo and Julian,"" nor is it even ""Jaime and Ste,"" but it's a lot closer to them that it is to American Pie, and it's a very good movie.",Nico and Dani
533836,"A lot of folk don't get this movie. The director is dealing not so much with war, but with the creation of a propoganda icon. The film jumps back and forth between reality and myth. In essence, it's the story of the Soviets building up a myth about a heroic sniper in the ruins of Stalingrad, taking his exploits and exagerating them. One scene may be gritty realism, while another surreal myth. The opening scene is a good example of the former, while the climax, in a hushed, mist shrouded rail yard, is the ultimate expression of the latter. Yes, it's impossible to imagine a day when any part of Stalingrad was virtually bereft of sound. The director knows this and that's the whole point. Watch the film while asking yourself, &quot;Is this scene a view of what 'really' happened, or part of the created myth?&quot; A friend, with more knowledge than I in such matters, tells me that there are many, obvious references to the great Soviet director Sergei Eisenstein. If you are looking for nothing but &quot;reality&quot;, I recommend _Band of Brothers_ instead. As for the romance, I'm usually very much against a slapped-together &quot;Hollywood&quot; romance, but it's well handled here and not a huge part of the story. Those who talk about it &quot;marring&quot; a large part of the film are prehaps seeing the romance as bigger than it is, hating the fact that it is there at all. Ironically, there were female snipers in Stalingrad and there has been a suggestion that the historical main character did have a romantic attachment to a female sniper. While watching, ask yourself if the romance appears in the &quot;realistic&quot; scenes or the &quot;mythical&quot; scenes...",Enemy At the Gates

372904,"I know that technically I am wrong on every count.  Joan Hickson is far closer to the character from the books than was Margaret Rutherford.  The T.V. series stuck far more closely to the plots of the books and the style of the books than did the MGM films.  And I know that, although they became great friends, Agatha Christie detested the films and thought Rutherford totally wrong for the part.Nevertheless, Margaret Rutherford had such charm and was clearly such an eccentric (as well as being an excellent character actress,) that I far prefer the generally maligned film series.  To top it off, Ron Goodwin's soundtracks were terrific.  It would be nice to see them on CD.  (Fat chance.)By all means, perpetuate the series via DVD, but PLEASE, MGM or Ted Turner or whoever currently holds the rights, issue the Rutherford films on DVD as well.The less said the better, however, about MGM's ill-conceived, ill-fated attempt to launch an Hercule Poirot franchise with Tony Randall.  And I LIKE Tony Randall.  I loved him in The 7 Faces of Dr. Lao, which, through some uncharacteristic burst of good taste, IS on DVD and which should be purchased forthwith.  When they actually manage to put out a deserving film, it is our responsibility to support the effort by buying it.  The book (The Circus of Dr. Lao) is 20 times better than the movie and should still be in print.One more thing and then I will shut up.  If you are a Margaret Rutherford fan, I strongly reccommend Mouse on the Moon.  Granted, Peter Sellers is AWOL, but ya got yer Margaret, ya got yer Terry Thomas, yer Ron Moody, Bernard Cribbens, John Le Mesurier, etc.  Ya got yer Richard Lester directing.

597141,"Jack the Ripper (David Warner) uses H.G. Wells' (Malcolm McDowell) time machine to escape justice and travel to 1979 San Francisco, with Wells in hot pursuit. That's the premise behind an entertaining film written and directed by Nicholas Meyer (Star Trek 2 & 4, The Day After). After a somewhat slow start, the film picks up once Wells reaches the future. Meyer shows acute awareness of how the real Wells might react in 1979 San Francisco: ever the inquisitive mind, Wells studies and learns as much as he can and never seems overwhelmed. After all, he was a visionary who wrote grand imaginings of the future; to a degree, he was already a man out of his time. The same is true for Jack the Ripper, who would feel more at home in our time (as stated in the film; in our time, he would be another Dahmer or Gacy). Simple things like that make this movie a cut above the average time-travel/fish-out-of-water film. It falls into convention at times, recycling some very familiar elements, but it still manages to entertain, thanks in large part to brisk direction and a marvelous performance by Mary Steenburgen as Wells' liberated love interest. McDowell and Warner are also good, and McDowell's performance is nicely restrained (given his occasional tendency to overact) in one of his better roles. I also liked the realization of Wells' time machine--very similar to how it is described in his book, but with a few tweakings to make it look a tad more ""realistic."" The special effects aren't great, but they are merely a sideshow to the plot. Also, some of the attempts at social commentary come across as preachy and heavy-handed. Never mind all of that. What matters here is plot and characterization. It's not a completely satisfying film, but it's intelligently done and engaging, with good doses of romance and suspense. An interesting speculation: Imagine the same film with Sherlock Holmes, or Thomas Edison, or Jules Verne transported to the future.",N/A
283231,"I have seen this film countless times to the point of having memorized the script. I'm not sure if such a ethnically centred character (though he comes out as moral giant compared with the rest) would ever be allowed in current stuffy PC Hollywood, so this will remain an inimitable classic. Seller plays Hrundi V.Bakhshi  would be indian actor - does dat include telvision sir? he asks -  Seller's Indian accent - as a specialist in east Indian impersonations myself I can recognize the talent -  is in my view the main attraction of the film. He's absolutely believable and the accent and intricate sophisticated and flowery english constructions typical of educated Indians are a contrast to the hype and flash of Hollywood.  After the kind of analysis that can only result from multiple viewing, i noted Sellers' character's salmon coloured tie to be a very important detail. It gets him caught - literally - in some of the key moments. also after such painstking viewing I find the very funniest line to come even before the credits appear. The laughs are constant however. The film also has some great music a morgan Three wheeler sports car and a big hat, that Hrundi V. Bakshi desperately wants back by the end of the film. warning, teh accent is addictive.

First I should point out that there are changes from the first movie. Just Mr. and Mrs. Little and thier sons George and Stuart Little are back along with both Monty (he is in a short part of the movie) and Snowbell are back.

Mr. Little (Hugh Laurie) and Mrs. Little (Geena Davis) allow Stuart to drive to and from school in his car, but his old brother George has to be with him. George now has a new friend named Will (Marc John Jefferies). And Stuart is lonely until one day when a bird named Margalo (Melaine Griffth) falls into his car on his way home from school.

535262,"Snatch is a fast-paced gangster thriller from England. Like many such British films, it is equal parts drama and black comedy. Our friends in the UK may take crime seriously, but they can't bring themselves to do the same with criminals. Perhaps there is a lesson for us there. I thoroughly enjoyed Snatch, but I must warn you that the accents can sometimes be hard to understand. The one used by Brad Pitt is intentionally indecipherable. Fortunately, I watched the DVD version, which has an option that puts subtitles on the screen whenever Mt. Pitt speaks. The video edition does not have this feature, but that doesn't matter too much. His dazzling performance is entirely physical in nature, so what does it matter what he has to say? The other characters don't understand him either.The movie was directed by Michael Ritchie, who is probably better known to Americans as Madonna's husband. His first picture, Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels, was also about psycho bad guys; in fact, Snatch is so similar to it that it is practically a sequel. The characters are different, but many of the same actors appear in both movies. Both films also share Ritchie's frenetic, stylish editing, as well as his fascination with lowlifes.The plot is so complicated that describing it is difficult. I had little problem following it, but several reviewers admitted to getting completely lost. Basically, the story is about a huge diamond that gets stolen from a jewelry company in Amsterdam. It bounces from one group of criminals to the next, and, of course, everybody wants to get their hands on it at any cost. Meanwhile, a boxing promoter is having a very difficult time with a vile, ruthless gang boss who is demanding that he fix a fight. This is where Brad Pitt's character, One Punch Mickey, comes in. He is part of a band of gypsies [thus, the accent] who are the trickiest double-dealing folks you are every likely to see. Soon, everyone is merrily out to get everyone else.The characters all have names straight out of a Damon Runyon story - Frankie Four Fingers, Bullet Tooth, Boris the Blade, Turkish and Brick Top are some of them. I think the names alone are enough of a clue that the movie is not to be taken seriously. One problem some viewers will have with it is that there are two or three times as many characters than in most movies. Keeping up with them can be a challenge.Snatch should prove to be great fun for those who love for a movie to be fast and innovative. For those who like them to be cool, calm and collected, another choice of movies is recommended.",Snatch

543612,"I am a Kevin Smith fan and have enjoyed the first four movies in the Jay and Silent Bob series.  I am also a frequent surfer of his ViewAskew website and read for months prior to its release about the fun that everybody had in making ""Jay and Silent Bob Strike Back"" and that this was going to be the best in the bunch.When the movie came out, I was one of the first in line to see it.  I have to admit that I was extremely disappointed and came out with the opinion that Jay and Silent Bob were best suited as support players and not lead characters.  I just felt that Jay was at his best when he chimed in here and there with a foul-mouthed smart-aleck comment instead of having to sustain it for 100 minutes.But I am a completest and since I have all of the other Kevin Smith movies on DVD, I had to make this purchase for no other reason to get the outtakes and to hear the director's commentary track.  Unlike most other commentary tracks where the director treats his movie like it is ""Citizen Kane"", ViewAskew commentaries are hilarious as the participants rag on each other, criticize Hollywood executives and some of the actors and aren't afraid to admit that a particular scene stunk.After a couple of different relooks at the movie, I have to say I like it and would rank it as the second best of the five (I unabashedly state that ""Mallrats"" is my favorite - although I'm probably the only one in the world who would say that).  It is a well shot movie, with great music and great performances by Shannon Elizabeth (she actually can act), Judd Nelson, Will Ferrell and most of all by Jason Mewes as Jay.  Cameos by Jason Lee, Ben Affleck, George Carlin (he's not washed up after all), Mark Hamill, Matt Damon and Deidrich Bader (from Drew Carey's show) were all enjoyable.My only criticism is that Chris Rock's cameo as an angry African-American movie director came off to me as extremely hateful and is a real turnoff.  I don't know the point that Kevin Smith was trying to make with that character, but he failed miserably, both at the theater and on DVD.This was a nice wrapup to the Jay and Silent Bob story.

708648,"This film is awesome.  If you like a good action-packed mystery/horror flick then you will love this movie.  It is the story of Mani and Fronsac two French/Indian war veterans who are asked to come to France to find and kill the invincible beast that is devastating a small French coutryside.  This film is not another mindless horror flick with a simple, formulaic plot.  It is very complex in terms of story and character motivations.  The characters themselves are all interesting and unique unto themselves.  Mani is an Iroquois Indian who fights like Jet Li.  The guy who plays Mani did a wonderful job.  I haven't seen so much charisma in an actor since Bruce Lee.  Fronsac is a naturalist/taxidermist who falls for a beautiful girl who is the daughter of the King.  He can also fight well.The best things about this movie is the story behind the wolf itself, the scenery and cinematography, the martial arts fighting (especially with Mani), the gorgeous women, and the camera direction.  The french subtitles didn't bother me at all but I might have to go see the film again because it was hard to follow sometimes.  It's just really complex, that's all.  It's also a long movie at a good two hours, maybe more.  I definitely wouldn't mind seeing it again.  It's the best action movie I've seen since the Matrix.

A small group of goofy government agents are sent to investigate a mass disappearance of the residents in a New Zealand town.  The disappearance is linked to a huge extraterrestrial fast food conglomerate which sets up shop in the town.  I shouldn't have to tell anyone what they put in the burgers.This is Peter Jackson's first movie.  As many of you know, he went on to direct Lord of the Rings, as well as the equally gory Dead Alive and the more mainstream but still great The Frighteners.  However, this film shows how well he was able to work with a far more modest budget.  Some of the effects and action sequences are impressive considering the limited resources, especially the chase scene involving agent Derek (played by Jackson) and an alien zombie (also played by Jackson).You should tell just by looking at the cover, which depicts an alien who looks like a Star Wars cantina reject flipping us the bird, that this is not to be taken seriously.  This really is not a horror movie as much as it is a comedy, an extremely gory comedy in which much of the humor revolves around the gore.  An example would be the hilarious scene in which Derek falls off a cliff and fractures his skull.  He literally has to keep his head together by tying his belt around it.Even though I can't recommend Bad Taste to all audiences, I truly think people who like Monty Python or South Park may find something to enjoy about it.",Bad Taste VHS

247876,"Post-Vietnam and post-Watergate, Americans back in the mid-1970's were, frankly, afraid. The world had turned upside down, and people were looking for something, anything, to say that we would be alright, or taken care of, or most especially, that we were not alone. Could we rely on a benign force of Nature, or God, or aliens, or other mysterious forces to save us? This fear and wonderment took the form of a blossoming interest in ESP, witchcraft, UFOs, Ghosts, Bigfoot, the Burmuda Triangle, and the mysterious magic of pyramids, King Tut, Stonehenge, and Easter Island. To fuel this public interest and acceptance of the Unknown, a new genre sprang up in film and television; the pseudo-science documentary. ""The Late Great Planet Earth"" is one of the earliest of these anecdotal, half-baked suppositions based on misread documents, bad science, and wishful thinking to justify its bizzare claims.Toward the end of his life, Orson Welles hosted a number of pseudo-science documentaries, and even had his own TV show about the mysteries that surround us (think, a low rent version of ""In Search Of""). ""The Late Great Planet Earth"" is one of these projects, and one of the better ones. In fact, it is actually one of the better examples of the genre.The production values are surprisingly good. The re-enactments are, for the most part, well handled. And of course, we have Welles, intimidating in his silvered beard and black suit, posing the questions of bible prophecy in that powerful voice. Certainly worth a viewing, even if you don't buy into bible prophecy.Of course the ""science"" here is worthless, and has been debunked a million times over. However, that isn't the reason people read Lindsey's book or watched this movie.The film is actually quite well made, so I encourage you to check it out. The opening sweep alone of Earth in space is a better-looking planet effects shot than any I can recall. And again, we have Welles.Pseudo-science documentaries died out in the early 1980's when the national mindset changed, and are deucedly hard to find today, especially on DVD. Perhaps it is a sort of national embarassment that keeps them from being more readily available, or perhaps the copyright holders of these films feel there is no value or profit in releasing them. This is unfortunate, for they need to be viewed, not only for comedy value, but as a window into the thinking of a past generation. After the events of September 11, the innocence and wonder on display in these projects is all the more poignant.",N/A
57448,"This well-meaning but flawed film purports to be about the life and times of Bruce Lee, the intense, talented actor and martial artist who died tragically all too young.  There is dispute over the biographical truth of the film, which is really neither here nor there, as the film seems far less interested in delving into Lee's biography than it does walking a strange line between drama and melodrama.  Though he doesn't much resemble the real-life Bruce Lee, star Jason Scott Lee tries hard to capture the actor's raw power and charisma, with mixed results.  He's best in the film's quieter moments, when the sincerity of his face gives the film much-needed grounding, and worst when his frenetic facial expressions and frequent shouting border on camp.  But this probably isn't Lee's fault, as the film itself drifts in and out of wanting to be taken seriously and wanting to be a pseudo-chopsocky matinee, all to an often-syrupy music score.  Co-star Lauren Holly is believable as Lee's caucasian wife, who struggles with him against racism that comes from so many in society--even her own mother.  It is here that the film works best, illustrating the humiliation and degradation of anti-Asian racism that Lee, who simply wants to be recognized as the American he is, endures from fellow Americans, even after achieving his fame.  A particularly clever--and dead-on accurate--scene reveals the isolation and thoughtless prejudice that Asian Americans frequently face:  amidst a crowd of whites roaring with laughter, Lee quietly suffers Mickey Rooney's grotesque yellowface characterization in the critically-acclaimed ""Breakfast at Tiffany's.""  Had the film focused more on meaningful emotional pyrotechnics like these, rather than the frequent, goofy interplay between Lee and a symbolic Mongol warrior, it might have captured the essence of the man instead of his onscreen persona.  Like ""Boogie Nights,"" it would have risen above the obvious exploitive qualities of its subject matter.",Dragon: The Bruce Lee Story

No need to mention Anthony Hopkins and Giancarlo Gianinni who are also perfect in their roles. I did not like the idea of replacing Jodie Foster with... Julianne Moore, but I guess the movie is so good, I'll have to forgive this mistake. Miscasting?

Well, as we all know, Hannibal Lecter is free and hiding somewhere in Italy. But one of his victims, wealthy Mason Verger is planing an elaborate scheme to get his revenge: trapping Hannibal Lecter to watch him being eaten by wild animals.I have to say the music is excellent, cinematography... wow!

This movie, like the book, is to ""The Lord of the Rings"" like a romance novel is compaired to ""A Tale of Two Cities"".  Sorry to say so Harry fans, but it's true.  Yes it is.

4123,"I won't bother to get into details of the stories, since that is already well-covered by other reviews on this site.This two DVD set includes ""The Murder of Roger Ackroyd"" and ""Lord Edgeware Dies"". The producers set these stories as taking place after previous episodes. This decision was probably made on account of how much older the actors look. While Poirot and Inspector Japp have aged gracefully, both Captain Hastings and Miss Lemon show their years.The Murder of Roger Ackroyd is one of Agatha Christie's most famous novels, but it translates poorly on the screen. It is impossible to go into details without giving away who the murderer is, but suffice it to say that the surprise of the novel is greatly diluted here. There is also a wistful sort of sadness that permeates the entire story, with none of the charm of the earlier episodes. There is also a feeling that the production was rushed, and that the actors feel uncomfortable in their roles.Lord Edgeware Dies is a much better production. All the old favorite characters are re-united here and some of the charm/humor missing in the first story is present here. There is also a greater sense of locale. This episode feels more populated and the variety of locations along with the complexity of the story helps keeps this moving along at an entertaining clip.If you have the opportunity to purchase the two DVDs seperately, definately choose Lord Edgeware Dies and forget about Murder of Roger Ackroyd.",N/A

As I recall, 'It's a Wonderful Life' didn't register on the radar at all in 1967 - were these guys on to something?Peter Cook and Dudley Moore, playing as a comedy team long past their 'Beyond the Fringe' days, showed up in a fair number of 1960s movies (also: THE WRONG BOX, THE BED-SITTING ROOM, THOSE DARING YOUNG MEN IN THEIR JAUNTY JALOPIES) but this film is clearly their own.In a perverse way, this film lifts me when I'm feeling down - the idea that one's fate is indifferently observed by Good and Evil is outweighed by the idea that one's fate is ultimately in one's own hands makes me feel the possibilities are, indeed, unlimited.Cook and Moore both died way too soon, but this film is forever. It addresses theological issues clearer than many 'serious' treatises.

484911,"John Cusack on the screen is infinitely watchable.  He teams up with director Stephen Frears (Grosse Pointe Blank) again for High Fidelity and the results are nothing short of entertaining.This adaptation of Brit Nick Hornby's novel sees the world through top five and top ten lists.  Cusack's character, Rob Gordon, is a man in progress, in fact a man in need of very much progress.  He owns a record store, works with two other man-boy vinyl purists (well-played by Jack Black and Todd Louiso), and refuses to be committed to any one relationship or any pursuit in life.  Cusack's latest love interest Laura, played by Iben Hjejle, is left wanting.  The acting is left wanting and the chemistry is left wanting.  The electricity is never very apparent between Cusack and Hjejle like that with Cusack and Minnie Driver in Grosse Pointe Blank.  But it's a minor flaw really.There are many funny moments here.  There are many hip moments here.  One of the hippest being Bruce Springsteen's cameo appearance dispensing sage observations while playing an incredible blues riff.  As Cusack goes hunting for someone to anchor his wandering soul, things almost rap up in the end in too neat of a package.  But the minor detractions really aren't enough to keep you away, especially with music as the common thread.  Needless to say we get to hear much good music as Cusack muses to the camera.This movie may not be Cusack's best, but it's right up there.

539820,"A man is found almost dead with two bullet holes in his back, but what is more mysterious is that when he regains consciousness, he finds that all of his memory is gone! A Swiss bank account number tattooed on this body leads him to discover he is Jason Bourne (Matt Damon) but no other facts are unearthed, except for knowing he has remarkable and terrifying talents. Besides finding out his name, he also finds in his Swiss box money, false passports, and a gun. With the help of a German gypsy, Marie (Franka Potente), he goes on a trail to find out his real identity. Unfortunately for him, assassins have a new target... him!""The Bourne Identity"" most certainly falls into the category of a spy thriller, a new venture for Matt Damon who is the star of the movie. Throughout the movie I was very impressed with his spectacular fight scenes, obvious that he had training in kickboxing, karate, and firearms, using the skills like a 'born' natural (no pun intended :). His acting is also well done, from his expressions, emotions, and even showing the lack of both. Franka Potente is also a good love interest in the movie. She displays both nervousness and strength in her character. Other notable stars are Clive Owen, Chris Cooper, and Julia Stiles, though their roles are very small.Of course the movie has spectacular action and fighting scenes, mesmerizing you throughout the film. From car chase scenes and foxes and hounds chases to hand to hand combat fighting and gun fighting, you will be tense with excitement and suspense! One of the interesting things about the movie is the car chase scene. Well, we all have seen probably numerous car chase scenes with the hero in a cool sports car, Matt Damon as Jason Bourne drives a mini cooper! Now that was interesting! But some of the fight scenes are a bit violent, especially the end, hence the PG-13 rating.The movie is not all action, there is actually a pretty neat plot! The story is based on Robert Ludlum's 1980 bestseller so you can rely on ""The Bourne Identity"" having an intricate plot with lots of twists and turns. But one thing that disappointed me was the conclusion. The end was a bit confusing, making you wonder what in the world had been going on? Maybe it was me or the ending didn't seem to make sense. But I think the filmmakers are just making way for the sequel which I expect since ""The Bourne Identity"" is only the first in a trilogy. The other two sequels are ""The Bourne Supremacy"" and ""The Bourne Ultimatum"".So, if you are looking for a movie with lots of action and thrills, I highly recommend you ""The Bourne Identity"" which I'm sure will satisfy!",N/A
708584,"This film is a masterpiece, taking what fairy tales were long before the Brothers Grim, Disney and other sanitizers changed them for children and bringing it to us in beautiful detail.Nothing is more horrfying than the unknown and one of the best things about this film is that they keep you guessing through most of the picture and they do not dumb it down. (Unlike Tim Burton's Sleepy Hollow which took out 90% of the suspense and made the film almost boring while we waited for Ichobod Crane to catch up with us in the audience.)It is witty, intelligent and so much better than most American films being produced today.Many of my friends found this film to bloody, as someone who HATES bloody films I did NOT find this too bloody. There was one objectional scene for me and that was brief. This was no means a blood bath film but it is VERY dark and is not some clean hollywood film where the good guys don't sweat or bleed.I had two problems with the film and they are personal issues:1.

The wolf hunt was horrible to watch if you are at all fond of animals, however as it was not a REAL wolf hunt and was what people would have done back then I found it less objectionable than the dead shepardess scene which was just a little too gross for me.Also the soundtrack is superb and fits the movie to a T.Go see this film or buy the DVD-Video when it comes out and you will be amazed!",N/A

But, unfortunately, the portrayal of the central character, Baron Frankenstein, is off when compared to other entries in the series, particularly high-points like ""Curse of Frankenstein"" and ""Frankenstein Created Woman.""In those films, there was something twistly heroic about Frankenstein... one almost finds oneself hoping he'll succeed. But here, he is just a vicious killer, a brutal rapist, a creature with no redeeming qualities safe for the inherent charm of Peter Cushing, the actor who portrays him.The tale has Frankenstein blackmail a crooked doctor at a local asylum into giving him access to a mad scientist soFrankenstein can cure the madness through brain surgery. The corruption of Frankenstein and the crooked doctor spread to engulf the doctor's otherwise innocent fiance. On the very night of Frankenstein's seeming triumph, everyone ends up paying for their crimes, including Frankenstein himself.The ""morality play"" aspect of this film works extremely well. What doesn't work is Frankenstein's completely monstrous nature. And it's made worse by the brutal rape he visits upon Victoria Carlson (who gives what is probably her best performance in this film). It's a shame really that the central character should be so off in the way he was written.",Frankenstein Must Be Destroyed VHS

(Is it Hollywood's skittishness about Hopkins playing one of the greatest Christian writers of the 20th Century?).This was an emotionally-shattering film to watch, a love story that reaches so much deeper than anything I'd seen before. I NEVER cry at films (came close with SCHINDLER'S LIST and THE ENGLISH PATIENT) but SHADOWLANDS pushed me over the edge. I remember watching the audience leave the theatre: they shuffled out with shell-shocked expressions, everyone looking deep into themselves. The parents of two sisters I took called me the next day to ask what we had seen (the girls went home and had been strangely quiet).I'd read C.S. Lewis' theological books for years but had no idea of what his personal life was like, so SHADOWLANDS was a wonderful insight into his life.(My only problem--and from what I've read of people who knew him--is one single line at the end of the film: ""I have no answers--only the life that I've lived.""

548552,"A critic named Pauline Kael has once said that there are such things as good trash and bad trash when it comes to movies. Her theory could certainly be proven under ""Dragoon"", an anime so goofy that since then NO SEQUEL's been made to follow up with it, even though the story is not yet completed. From the dubbing to the animation, nothing is pitch perfect, but it could be worth a chuckle or two, and it makes for great fanfiction material.""Dragoon's"" story is one of the oldest stories of all time. Basically, Sedon, a young man with an aging father, must now carry on his father's skill and courage to survive the future. That future arrives to him in the form of a lost and beautiful woman, who doesn't remember that she is part of an evil plan, and therefore many villains want her. Along the way, the young man must protect the woman through his healer sister, a lance-wielding prince named Lain, a fiery beaut named Lilith and her trusty knife-wielding assistant.That's about where the differences end. The animation is corny, nothing as skillful compared to Digimon or anything from Clamp. But there's a ton of nudity included in this one. The shiest character, the woman May, has a nude scene almost every 10 minutes!!! If that doesn't get your noodle nutty, read this; Sedon's sister and Lilith also bare their bums too. This is a guilty-pleasure anime that's just ambrosia to anime nerds who dig naked women in a medieval setting.You want violence? There is some, especially some graphic explosions and swordplay with blood shooting everywhere. But it's very tame compared to the nudity, which no doubt is the explanation for the anime's +17 rating.The characters can be good for some, bad for others. Let me explain. The characters have hardly a mite for any development. They are often involved in predictable situations (e.g., sibling rivalry, uneasy inheritance of power) that you've seen before not just in anime, but in ""Dawson's Creek"". My favorite characters are Lilith, Sedon's sister and Lain. I couldn't gather much info, but I think Lain and Sedon's sister make quite a couple. I wouldn't mind Sedon and Lilith, but I have no idea who May really is. She's not a character, just a plot point that will have men leering at her from all angles.Maybe you folks could spare a view of ""Dragoon"", but if you really like it, be warned; there's no sequel made for this story. Then again, why don't you conjure your own sequel? That way, you could imagine all the nudity that you want.",Dragoon VHS

587085,"Bergman, Fellini, Kurosawa, Kubrick, Welles. A week ago, I would never have thought to have included David Lynch among these visionary masters. But then I purchased the DVD for &#65533;Mulholland Drive&#65533; on a whim (something I rarely do for films I&#65533;ve never seen). I sat one night in front of the flat screen in my LA home, put the disc into the player, and was held captive for two and a half hours by a work of startling cinematic genius. It was, like all great films, a work that haunted me for days afterwards; a work that I wanted to immediately share with those closest to me -- but only those who would be willing, and able, to work through a very difficult film to the harrowing truths that glowered beneath the surface like a brilliant blue light.There are many good filmmakers. There are some great filmmakers. But those handful who are considered true masters, true geniuses of the cinema, all share one trait: they adhere almost religiously to the idea of film as a Visual art form. Simply put, they allow the images, and the arrangement of those images, to tell the story. They aren&#65533;t content, as most mainstream filmmakers are, with allowing a linear written narrative to wholly dictate the visual presentation of their films. Rather, they respect the raw, organic nature of an idea, they allow that idea to spread its roots, and they cull the images and the sounds together that will bend to the inclinations of that idea. Thus, these films, like &#65533;Mulholland Drive,&#65533; do not follow the simplistic but comforting A-B trajectory of most films, which are usually nothing more than cinematic renderings of novels. (Film and Literature are equally important artistic mediums; but the masters understand that they are essentially very distinct animals and should be treated as such.)And so it is that &#65533;Mulholland Drive,&#65533; like Bergman&#65533;s &#65533;Persona,&#65533; Fellini&#65533;s &#65533;8 1/2,&#65533; and Kurosawa&#65533;s &#65533;Rashomon,&#65533; decidedly turns traditional linear narrative upside down and inside out, and does so gleefully. Lynch&#65533;s film is like a prolonged fever dream of the most intense human emotions: paranoia, anger, grief, jealousy, remorse and a soul-wrenching despair. It is a work that transcends its film noir underpinnings and becomes, ultimately, an incisive examination of Hollywood as &#65533;Dream Factory&#65533; and of the troubling implications that arise from our unquestioning willingness to embrace its position as such. Lynch seems to suggest that our willingness to surrender to the &#65533;dream&#65533; that is Hollywood makes us complicit in the crimes that Hollywood then commits to further sustain that &#65533;dream.&#65533; And he doesn't exclude himself from this complicity (the brash young filmmaker Adam Kesher is arguably a self-parody).I will not discuss the specifics of the plot because I think that would be a true injustice for those who have not yet had the privilege of working through this masterpiece. All I will say is that of all of the films from all over the world that I have had the honor of taking into my mind and my heart, few have shaken me as much as &#65533;Mulholland Drive.&#65533; I cannot emphasize enough how brilliant Naomi Watts&#65533; performance is in this film. To even call it a performance seems like an insult. I have rarely, if ever, seen a young actress so fully inhabit the skin of her character as Ms. Watts does here. Her character arc in this film is not simply A to B to C. It is more like BA to AB to C, and what a heartbreaking C it is. Those of you who have seen and understood the heart of the film will know what I mean.Mr. Lynch and Ms. Watts, if you are reading this, one lowly cinephile salutes you.",Mulholland Drive

He admires and wishes to learn from a rich, successful capitalist rather than someone who has foresaken worldly goods in the service of the poor, for instance, or a prisoner of conscience in some gulag somewhere. The wine list is terrible in those places and anyway, death knows what 'The Stranglers' know, that is, it's only the children of the wealthy that tend to be good looking.

The industrialist is played by Anthony Hopkins who obviously seems to view himself as an elder statesman to such an extent that he barely appears to be in the picture. He is smug and avuncular and you expect him to break out into a royal wave at any moment. Rather than lend a hand to some poor peasant whose about to have their land taken away from them by a tyrant, death lends a hand to a walking dollar sign in a less than scintilating boardroom battle that is supposed to have us laughing and cheering. Death is a bit repugnant, it seems.Slow and long, the director fancies this as his 'Being There', only you get Pitt instead of Sellars. Pitt is gorgeous but looking at that face for three hours is like gorging on a box of chockies. Too much of a good thing makes you want to throw. Death bends his own rules and let's a very good looking man go on living, presumably because blood on such a sharp suit may ruin any future job interview as a male model. We can't have that, can we? As the fireworks explode and the camera pulls back on a scene of outdoor opulance, we are reminded that it's a hard life for the privileged in letting go. No longer will they be able to watch films which make them feel good about being American. I mean, death loves America. He loves low cut dresses. If I should meet Joe Black, I'll know what to say. &quot;Lend us a fiver, Joe, the lights have gone out and I need to feed the meter.&quot;",N/A
178682,"Ahh, what is there to be said. After watching both as soon as I got the DVD from Amazon, I find that I am completely dumbfounded at Scott's choices of cuts in the director's edition. The first half was magic as only true fantasy storytelling could be in every aspect except the music (which I'll get to later). However, after the setting moves to Darkness' keep, it becomes apparent why Scott made the cuts he made in the first place when Legend was first theatrically released. The standoff between Darkness and Lili loses its edge and tension with the director's cut and becomes something akin to dinner conversation with a new date. This is symptomatic of the entire second half, as the director's cut loses the cohesiveness and pacing of the original release with alot of unnecessary and out of place scenes and dialogue. Yes I understand that such scenes were meant to add to each character's development, but I think Scott failed in that regard here. In the first half he was successful, revealing for the first time Jack's ability to speak with animals and such, but in the dramatic second half it just gets in the way and interrupts the drama and action. And Darkness' father has a really annoying voice now too.As for the music, I really was disappointed with Goldsmith's work, which has been superb in other movies. It was not nearly as emotive as the TD score nor as unique and supportive of the scenes. Specifically, the TD score was far superior in the black dress dancing scene a waltzy dance number with a hint of discord and evil whereas the Goldsmith score was a dance, rather light and breezy which of course did not fit at all. And he botched the ending! The original ending was nearly perfect, and he completely deviates from it. But oh well, I have to go to work, hope this helps.",N/A

More of a prequel than a sequel, this movie is about a Mexican outlaw who kidnaps an executioner's daughter and finds himself chased by soldiers, criminals and, of course, vampires. The ending is very cool with the action staying pretty solid. A fun hour and a half of nonstop action and humor.",From Dusk Till Dawn 3: The Hangman's Daughter
113334,"So many films in my collection are &quot;important&quot;, &quot;serious&quot;, &quot;disturbing&quot;, or &quot;great&quot;, and as much as I treasure them (films like Citizen Kane, Vertigo, and Ran), there is only so much self-importance a person can take before the pores fairly scream out for something just plain fun;  something slight, buoyant, silly, and full of energy.  Singin' in the Rain is just that kind of movie.  The funny part is, I generally HATE musicals!In 1951, Gene Kelly and Stanley Donen took a collection of songs by Arthur Freed and Nacio Herb Brown and - assisted by a pitch-perfect screenplay from the writing team of Adolph Green and Betty Comden - sculpted one of the great classic fusions of popular cinematic art and precision dance craft.  It is the Citizen Kane of musicals: a virtual catalog of musical film technique, executed flawlessly.But that alone would not be enough to separate Singin' in the Rain from the kind of musical I can't stand (which is to say, just about every other musical ever made).  No, what makes this one special is that it knows what it is and celebrates it.  It never for a moment asks you to forget you're watching a movie and then grinds to a screeching halt for the musical number.  Instead, it deconstructs itself before your very eyes (and ears) as a razor-sharp, self-aware satire of the movie industry - as well as a joyous expression of the pure ecstasy of great song and dance.  In that sense, it is one of the few so-called musicals that actually achieves a genuine symbiosis of drama, music, and kinetic performance art.If all this sounds rather gushing and pretentious, so be it.  This is great film-making.  It is Rolex Oyster Perpetual film-making.  This DVD edition sparkles with ultra-saturated colors, digitally remixed Dolby 5.1 sound, and some terrific extras (even if you're not particularly into musicals).My favorite sequence is the eerily fluid dance work between Gene Kelly and Cyd Charisse against a Dali-esque background near the end of the film.  Charisse is spellbinding as she trails a gravity-defying veil that must be 30 feet long.  It hangs in the air, suspended by wind machines as she uses her extraordinary dance skill (and fantastic legs) to affect a wordless seduction of Kelly's naive, love-struck hero.  Great stuff.Even if you don't think of yourself as the &quot;musical type&quot;, give Singin' in the Rain a try.  After all that heavy, bitter, existential cinema, it makes one helluva fine dessert.",N/A
496987,"I didn't see this film when it was in the theatre, despite urging from friends to do so. I didn't because Hollywood's approach to stories with racial themes is usually so politically correct as to insult the viewer's intelligence (which is demonstrated by my buying the DVD, rather than paying $5.00 for the matinee ticket?). This is a well made movie with an excellent cast. The interaction between the German POW Camp staff and the prisoners is excellent - taut and dramatic. The racial bias of the white enlisted men vs. the black Air Force officers is also realistic, and because it is not sanitized, it comes across very well. Good films are ""good"", because they draw the viewer into the story; one becomes a viewer, through the camera, of the plot, and often loses the sense of ""watching a movie"". Older films have less of this characteristic, I think, because stylized camera and acting techniques of that time detract from the viewer becoming totally immersed in watching believeable action. This movie brings the viewer into contact with characters and plot from the outset, and never lets go. Bruce Willis has come a long way from the ""Die Hard"" days, and is more convincing because of his matured talent. The rest of the cast perform very well. It's a very enjoyable, yet thought provoking experience.",Hart's War
526961,"In Short:Pros1: Jackie Chan has the perfect part in this movie, very believable role for him.2: Pretty clean humor you could watch it with the family (even the Indian peace pipe scene does not expressly state it's marijuana).3: Excellant chemistry between Chan and Wilson.4: Yes there are fight scenes here but not much blood at all.Pro or Con:1: There are fewer stunts and fight scenes than in some other Chan movies and they tend to be more in line with what you see in other movies at times.  For some this is a good thing for others not but it's still got some good action sequences to go with the comedy.ConsNothing significant really.I'm a fan of Jackie Chan's so it's no wonder that I liked this but I also think it is one of his better movies.It's a pretty good take on a standard plotline involving the good guys saving the princess and works very well as a vehicle for the humor and stunts we get with most any Chan movie. Chan and Wilson have good on screen chemistry and create an endearing image of a likeable cowboy want-a-be and a Chinese immigrant come from the emperors court to save his princess.I thought the scene where Chan is befriended by a local Indian tribe after saving one of the chiefs daughters was one of the highlights but I do kind of wonder what an Indian would make of it (it involves Marijuana and some interesting conversation subtitles). Man Who Fights In Dress is instantly liked by the Indians even though no one can understand him.Owen Wilson's character is a contemporary take on the American cowboy and old west opportunist. He equals Chan on the humor side perhaps but not on the stunt end, that is Jackie's show through and through. The standard out takes and bloopers are at the end but are shorter than I've seen on other Chan films, whether there was fewer of them or what I don't know. It's a very small part of the product of course that does not detract from the film.I would not say this is Chan's best movie for stunts necessarily and the fighting choreography has been better in other pictures. What I rate this film so highly for is the overall pace of it and the flow of the movie. This is one of those movies that seem to fly past even though it is in fact a standard length picture leaving you wishing there was more.It's really very good in my opinion.",Shanghai Noon

Moulin Rouge is an indulgent mess, with a few wonderful sequences and performances (most notably by Ewan McGregor and Jim Broadbent, both of whom are quite good) Personally I am mystified by the film's appeal.  Kidman and Leguizamo are both way over the top, the story is much too simplistic and the dance sequences are unfocused and dull.  I would very much like Luhrmann to take a look at an earlier film of his ""Strictly Ballroom"" and take a lesson from it.

The only people that have given this movie 1 star was because they were anti-war fanatics and just want to downgrade war in general. This movie is very realistic for the most part, absolutely action-packed, and will have you sitting on the edge of your seat from the second that the fighting begins.On the other hand, like a lot of American war films...this movie is extremely biased towards the American side of the story, not to mention the fact that it also only focuses on the American troops fighting...and not the Pakistani and other troops helping the UN side. It also portrays the Somalis as heartless people, when they were no more heartless then the Americans fighting.All in all, it is still a great movie, I'd recommend it to anyone that isn't weak of the heart.",N/A
26154,"The title of the review makes this film seem like paradise, but as soon as watch it you will find that it's not.  It's basically a darkly humorous and daydream filled movie about government becoming too controlling by using fear and paperwork (lots of paperwork).  It is inspired by '1984', but it doesn't plagiarize because there are significant differences between the two and the most important one being that 'Brazil' isn't humorless like '1984.' Although the director is American he used to be in a Brittish comedy group called Monty Python, you may have heard of them. I say this because the film has very Brittish feel to it because many of the actors are Brittish (Michael Palin was even in Monty Python).  The production design also has the outlandish feeling of animation because the director mostly did the humorous animation bits for the movies and series for Monty Python. This shows up in many models that were built for this movie.  Most people can't get past this, but if that weren't enough the screenplay was co-written by Tom Stoppard who loves to do dialogue that includes language jokes that I think many Americans won't find funny.  Add to that the fact that it's 2 hours and 22 mins long.  Most won't be able to make it past all of that.  A friend of mine said that the film bored him even though he thought it was visually brilliant.  In my opinion the film needs that amount of time in order introduce you not only to this wacky and dangerous world, but to the dreamworld of the main character and how they become increasingly difficult to differentiate.  Despite all of these 'setbacks' it isn't a smart film and it doesn't take multiple viewings to understand the film, people just enjoy it and were willing to go through the 'setbacks' that other people can't get past. I personally don't even find it difficult to watch at all and enjoy revisiting the world that 'Brazil' offers, or least the one that Sam, the main character dreams up.Also, I must note that the DVD features have just as many 'setbacks' as the film because they are very comprehensive. There are the usual things such as the trailer and the promo documentary, but there are other longer features as well.  A long documentary about the trouble the director had with getting Universal to distribute his film is included as well as long text explanations of the development for the script. Storyboards and many others are more than most can take, but if you're a student of film and find this one fascinating, then this is the best place to look.",N/A

The whole identity of the killer in &quot;CUT&quot; is actually absurd and ends up turning the movie into a bad episode of Nickelodeon's &quot;ARE YOU AFRAID OF THE DARK?&quot;  or &quot;GOOSEBUMPS&quot;. The identity of killer was a let down. The acting, however, was actually good for this type of movie..but the script needed some work (there are too many cliche one-liners at the end..especially by Molly's character). Also, the killings and gore were quite good and stylish. The only problem I have is the plot..and identity of the killer. Instead of making it 82 minutes, they should have fleshed it out more, creating more of a background on the characters. There is a &quot;secret&quot; that we find out about on the the main characters but it's just spoken once and it just doens't make sense that no one would know about it before.

111107,"Stephen King's bestseller SALEM'S LOT is a surprisingly complicated novel that first presents a detailed portrait of normal life in a small New England town--normal life that is gradually perverted when the town becomes infested by the undead.  And with a cast that includes such memorable performers as James Mason, Lew Ayres, Elisha Cook Jr., and Marie Windsor, this 1979 two-part television special seemed to a great deal going for it.  Unfortunately, however, director Tobe Hooper and his screenwriters are unable to find a way to streamline the novel's numerous characters and subplots into any dramatic whole, and the result is a film that constantly references a host of characters, events, and ideas but seldom to any real effect.Even so, the film does have its charms.  Chief among them is James Mason in one of his final performances, offering a brilliant, sinister, and wickedly witty performance as Mr. Straker, the servant of the vampire.  Ayres and Bedelia are also extremely good, and although Cook and Windsor are largely wasted they are nontheless entertaining to watch.  And the film does offer a few ""jump in your seat"" thrills: the scenes of child vampires floating outside bedroom windows are truly creepy, and the great vampire himself harkens back to the silent film NOSFERATU in a most effective way.Still, most viewers will find the film fairly tame.  David Soul was not a memorable actor, the script is incredibly talky, and there are too many lose ends for the story to be satisfying.  It will be of most interest to fans of King's work who would like to see how television handled this, one of his most successful novels.  A word of warning: there are two versions of this film.

292911,"Rating: +4In the eighties, Evil Dead was a moderate success for director Sam Raimi & somehow managed to gross $2,400,000 upon it's initial release in the U.S  even though the budget was only $375,000. Despite mixed reviews from critics, the film has since managed to acquire a dedicated following as well as two successful sequels. (Horror writer Stephen King gave the film massive props in a November 1982 issue of Twilight Zone.) Not only did the sequels do exceptionally well, the films have all received multiple re-issues on DVD & several re-pressings through various distributors. Probability suggests that Evil Dead's popularity will remain a constant & this film's devoted followers will always cite this first entry as being their absolute favorite.Within the past few years, Evil Dead has also been made into an off-Broadway musical production with the approval of Bruce Campbell & Sam Raimi.Although Evil Dead 2 works well as a sequel, I've always considered the film to be a re-visioning of the first low-budget classic only this time Raimi had more moo-lah-ah to play with. Even though there are sure-fire elements of horror present, I'm not REALLY sure I'd call it a straight-forward horror flick as it's way too goofy to be taken seriously. Having said that, there's plenty to love here & more reason to re-visit Evil Dead a second time. Need I say that the laughs come as fast as the gore??How gory is Evil Dead 2? The film is unrated which means it wasn't submitted to the MPAAbecause it surely would have gotten something more than an R), and in fact inspired the distributor (De Laurentiis Entertainment Group, founded by Dino De Laurentiis) to create Rosebud Releasing for this one film. There are plenty of decapitations, zombies, supernatural demons, and plenty of gore to satisfy the blood-thirsty nuts like myself who simply can't get enough of it. Oh, yes there will be blood. Buckets.For some odd reason, Ash (played by Bruce Campbell) seems to love taking weekend trips with his girlfriend to this evil little place in the woods. You would think he might've learned his lesson after dealing with those demons from hell in the first entry & decided to take up golf as a hobby or maybe find another vacation spot. Instead, he would rather do battle with these evil minions in a haunted cabin once again. Some guys never learn I guess.Evil Dead 2 picks up immediately where it's predecessor ended. Ashley takes his girlfriend on a seemingly romantic vacation back to the cabin in the woods. All is well until Ash begins to play a recording of Professor Knowby's incantations from the Necronomicon (roughly translated ""Book Of The Dead"") & the trouble immediately starts up again. As once can probably guess, the recorded passages unleash an evil force which takes possession of Linda's body & Ash is forced to either kill her or be killed.I could go into further details here for you but why kill the ultimate experience? As anyone who has seen this entry or any other Evil Dead film an tell you, the proof is definitely in the pudding. What becomes of a terrified Ash & is it really possible to kill Linda? If Ash can bring himself to murder the girlfriend, will she stay dead? Will Ash ever escape this nightmare in the woods or will he find himself the catalyst in a series of grotesque encounters with the demonic world?Evil Dead is often touted as being a zombie flick by it's fans or cult following. While there are elements of the film which do remind us of zombie flicks, I've always seen the film to be about demonic possession. I will even go so far as to say I've seen countless threads or postings online where people have debated this for many years. At any rate, it's an entertaining flick & that's all that should matter.

589377,"In his first English language film, ""Heaven"", German director Tom Tykwer abandons his earlier displays visual pyrotechnics, fast cut editing, and adrenaline laced pacing, to present us with heart felt meditation on the nature of unconditional love. This may disappoint some fans of his brilliant trilogy of films (""Night Sleepers"", ""Run Lola Run"" and ""Princess and the Warrior"") which explored the themes of syncronicity, metaphysics and causality. It is the blissful performance of the cameleon-like actress Cate Blanchett that allows Tykwer the space to breathe and expand his artistic vision.""Heaven"" begins as a thriller involving a woman obsessed with avenging the death of her husband, but quickly shifts gears and becomes an exploration of love between doomed outsiders, another favorite Tykwer theme. Tykwer shot the film in Italy and it is technically a bi-lingual film, because much of the dialogue is in Italian. Giovanni Ribisi, whose career has alternated between lackluster and compelling acting efforts, presents a starkly well crafted perfomance of an Italian policeman who becomes obsessed with Cate Blanchett's school teacher character. The langorous pacing of ""Heaven"" allows us linger on the voluptuous camera work of Frank Griebe, Tykwer's brilliant cinematographer. Griebe's sensual, impressionistic lens has become the trademark of a Tykwer film.In his last film, ""The Princess and the Warrior"", Tywker gave ample notice that he was maturing as a director, and was becoming more concerned with character development over technical gimmickery. Many of Tykwer's younger devotees may point out logical flaws in the script or find the film's more tender moments absurd.

This is the kind of movie I think women can get their football loving husband to watch.",French Kiss VHS
450424,"THE ACTING WAS GREAT, THE STORY A BIT ONE SIDED:Gwyneth Paltrow and Jean Tripplehorn do an excellent job pulling off duel roles for the same character in this romantic/comedy/drama. The leading men are equally charming in both their particular ways. (Tongue in cheek here).  The story line is creative as well, but more could have been done a little less extremely.  The characters are very one-sided and could have been more creatively handled.BASIC IDEA, WE ALL WONDER WHAT IF:How many times do we have an opportunity to have an insignificant event play an important point in our life, that we don't even realize the significance.  This was the fundamental thrust in the movie.  Timing.  What forces out there guide (or not) our lives?  How much is chance and how much is destiny? If you believe the director/writer in this story, only one path works.  This was the part I didn't like.BASIC STORY:Gwyneth Paltrow's character is involved with a two timing boyfriend, who's lack of character and overbearing mistress dominate both their lives.  Due to a minor change in timing one version takes Gwyneth's character out of his life.  In the other scenerio, she falls prey to her unconfirmed doubts.  Both of their lives continue and the story ends at another crossroads.  I can't say more without giving it away.  However, I think the director, could have handled it a bit more creatively and even handedly.DARK VERSUS LIGHT:The comedy is dark in some situations as you see how manipulated and domineered Gwyneth's character becomes by her situation, while remaining in the louse of a boyfriend's life.  Ironically, the darker scenario, her hair is dark.  And the lighter (kind of) scenario, her hair is light. In this situation once she gets on with her life with another man, the comedy is light and whimsical.  A bit too obvious however.  The drudge versus the successful working womanHATED SOME OF THE ENDING:The only major flaw I find in the movie is the ending.  This was a bit too much.  Is this the directors punishment for all the strong determined woman out there, who have dumped their louses?  What were you thinking?  Shame on you.It was an interesting movie that was at time a bit predictable at times but enjoyable none the less.  One wonderfully hysterical part of it was the dialogue between Jerry and his (sympathetic?) mate at the bar.  How many louses expect sympathy for their situation.  This guy was for real.  Also, the British humor was wonderful.  What does bollux mean?",N/A

This is a gorgeous, action-packed film that has all the right Anime elements. If you are a fan of Japanimation like ""Ghost In The Shell"", then you MUST see this movie. The story centers around a secret organization and one of their top super-powered agents, a ""Spriggan"", who tries to stop another secret organization from exploiting the hidden power behind Noah's Ark.This is a great looking movie, the blending of CGI and cell animation was done so one style did'nt overpower the other.

596391,"In the year 2054 the Justice Department has set up it's first Precrime unit in Washington DC. Through the visions of three psychic ""precogs"" who can see homicides before they actually occur, members of the precrime unit (precops) can arrest people before they commit murder. Murder has literally become non-existent in DC.Chief of the Precrime unit John Anderton (Tom Cruise) believes in the system 100%. Six years ago his son disappeared and now he pours himself into his work in hopes of preventing what happened to his son from happening to others.It makes no sense that Anderton's name comes up in the system as a murderer-to-be. He desperately tries to prove his innocence, but if this premonition is a lie, then the system he believes in and lives by is a failure.I don't predict any awards given for this film. However, credit must be given to the brilliant creativity and vision of director Steven Spielberg. I noticed definite influences from the late Stanley Kubrick here. This future world that Spielberg creates is extremely well thought out and detailed, some real brilliance here (I can't say too much). This is a typical role for Tom Cruise. Max von Sydow wonderfully plays Cruise's boss, Lamar Burgess, Director of Precrime. This is a fast-paced film, not just with action, but also with dialog, ideas and new concepts. It doesn't leave you in the dust, though. Everything comes together nicely.",N/A

664432,"""opera"" is one of argento's most memorable films, again not because of the needlessly excessive and at times just revolting violence, but because of the real fear and terror that the mysteriousness of the killer generates and his twisted relationship to the 'protagonist' female who he physically and mentally terrorizes. obviously this has nothing more to do with realism than any of argento's other movies--i seriously doubt the killer could get this girl with these things on her eyes THAT many times in all those convenient situations he happens to successfully stalk her in--but this goes without saying for his fans, including myself, and does not bother me. the fascinating thing is the comment argento is making on our relationships to one another and how they are, no matter how superficially convincing the facades may be, not what they seem, and are often rooted in depravity and brutality be it of a mental if not physical kind.what takes away from it, though, is the horrendous and ultra cheesy soundtrack that argento pasted on the film. it's really bad heavy metal that has no place in any of the scenes, and if you didn't know argento, you'd think that it was a deliberate joke or partial parody on the part of the director. that's him, i guess. lots of odd idiosyncrasies, the laughable soundtracks being the more harmless one.for those who have a taste for the campy and demented, ""opera"" is another argento treat.",N/A

556536,"""Don't Tell Mom the Babysitter's Dead"" is an all-time comedy great. It shows that when you work hard and work together how you can get something done. When Sue Ellen, Walter, Kenny, and Melissa's mother goes to Australia for the summer they are left home with a babysitter. She's not any ordinary babysitter, she's and old lady that is rule oriented and is very, very strict. The kids decide that they have had enough and when Sue Ellen, the oldest of the kids, goes down to talk to her, she is found dead. They have no money and Sue Ellen is working for a clothing company for the summer. Thus starts a funny and often touching comedy.At the beginning of this film, Sue Ellen has a bad attitude, along with her siblings, about their whole summer. Sue Ellen gets a high position in the clothing company by submitting a made up resume and the job is tedious and very hard. As the movie progresses, she is developed into the young woman that she really is and disovers for herslf how she can accomplish things. She's not the only one that changes. Her brother, Kenny, is a delinquent at the start of the movie as he hangs with the wrong crowd and is off every night using drugs. By the end of the film he changes into a courteous young man that has respect not only for the people and things around him, but for most importantly, himself. The whole family works as a team during their summer and at the end of the movie you know the signifigance of hard work and effort among a group.The comedy in this film is very good and you'll be having a belly laugh every few minutes. This is a comedy that is great for the whole family to sit down to and enjoy. It is funny, touching, and gives great messages. Not many other comedies can do that. this is heartily recommended to the lover of a great comedy or a film with great messages.",N/A

683476,"For starters, if you have seen or read Shakespeare's Othello, then you already know what happens in this film. With that in mind the filmakers have done a good job adapting it into a realistic present day tradgedy.Odin is the star player of his prep school basketball team, he is popular, dates the girl of his dreams, the coach loves him like a son, and colleges are fighting over him. So what is the problem? The coach has a son, Hugo (sound familiar?) that wants his dad to love him like a son. He does everything his father asks yet Odin was still the MVP. All he wants is a little appreciation. Too bad they didn't give it to him. So angry is Hugo that he unleashes the largest double-cross since Iago double-crossed Othello. It is too good to go on. Lets just say for a while it goes as planned.There are several major hang ups with this film that can't be overlooked. Unfortunatly some of them are plot spoilers so it would be wrong to go into them. However, this film does raise an interesting question about society, especially our youth. How long should we let people go before we ask is everything okay? See the film and you will understand.The acting from the young cast is solid and the film looks great. The all rap soundtrack was a little out of place, but it did serve well in some dramatic moments. The story is very solid, but don't forget, Shakepeare really wrote it. And on an additional note, anyone who is affraid this film is in Shakepearian English can relax, it's not.Problems aside, this film is worth a watch. I say read Othello first, but then it will give away the plot. Still the comparison is interesting and the filmmakers did a good job making it contemperary.",O

82593,"Don't get me wrong, this is an excellent dvd set, but...There are moments that make me wonder, is this all really necessary?For instance, the film looks good. Very good. Too good. There is not a flaw to be seen, no specks, no dirt, no dust. Nothing. It's simply too clean. I get this horrible feeling sometimes that I'm not watching the original film, but a remake!Yet the restoration is well done, and the colors are simply phenominal. This is how the film must have looked the first time it was shown.There are many bonus materials here, almost all of which are excellent. The lost scenes are fascinating, the additional music and film materials are interesting, and the development ideas are well presented.Then comes the scariest moment of all - a history of the Disney company.It starts off well enough, and we get to see all the artistic acheivements that happened in the 30's, 40's, 50's, and 60's, but when we get to the 80's, it gets scary. We basically have a laundry list of everything the Disney comapny owns, parks, baseball teams, hockey teams, boats, and on and on. I was waiting for Angela Lansbury to pull out the deed to the country. What was sad was how blunt the presentation was of what is basically corporate propaganda. It ruined the spirit of the whole set for me, as I realized that these dvds weren't made to celebrate art, they were made to celebrate the beginning of a corporate monolith.Ah well, the rest of this set is great, and by buying it, I've increased stock values.Enjoy!",N/A
61836,"""Hindenburg"" is a pretty good film that unfortunately falls a bit flat. The concept, sets, effects, and the cast are all excellent, but there just seems to be some element missing.The cast is populated with famous faces from yesterday, a standard practice in all 70's disaster movies. Here we have the incomparable Gig Young, Burgess Meredith, Charles Durning, Richard A. Dysart, Robert Clary (late from ""Hogan's Heroes"" at this point), future Star Trek actor Rene Auberjonois, and Roy Thinnes. And of course, we have Anne Bancroft and George C. Scott. Scott and Thinnes really do their best, too (look at their confrontation scene when Thinnes' character mentions Scott's dead son!).Still, the cast just seems to be shuffling through this one, with little or no true tension generated, other than an emergency repair by some crewmen who must venture out onto the hull of the ship (an act that was accomplished, but never happened on Hindenburg's last trip).The end result is somewhat sparse, even strangely emotionless for the most part. Despite the overall blandness in tone, the film is compelling to watch anyway (thanks in large part to the cast and the effects).Knowing as we do what will eventually happen at Lakehurst, one cannot help but marvel at the ironic line the Hindenburg's Captain Proust utters several times throughout the course of film. In regards to the United States' bad luck with dirigibles he remarks, ""It's no wonder they lose all their airships.""The ending of the film seems to mystify some viewers today, but it is, in reality, an incredibly artistic, stylish (and daring), choice on the part of director Robert Wise and the producers. Capturing the action in black and white, with actual newsreel footage of the disaster added, and freezing images in place, Wise makes a stunning montage of the disaster and of the cast members as they flee the impending peril. Even though the end result is only partially effective, the montage makes an artistic statement nevertheless, the kind that Hollywood avoids today. With noisy garbage like ""XXX"" and ""Ace Ventura"" littering our cineplexes, it's nice to know that at one time in the recent past, there was room in Hollywood for some creative and bold artistry in films! Would that it could become fashionable again!An interesting side note here is the night time launch of the Hindenburg. The ship is lit with searchlights that create odd, circular patches of light on the airship's hull. Five years later, Wise directed the critically panned ""Star Trek: The Motion Picture"". In that film, the Starship Enterprise is lit in a similar fashion, with spotlights on the ship's various insignia that create pools of light from odd angles.",N/A

578627,"There's trouble down at Malibu Beach in the early Sixties. Sensible Florence Forrester has begun to ignore her trueblue friend Burdene in favor of ""that sleazy beach crowd,"" a group of young surfbums who have taught her to ride the waves and renamed her ""Chicklet."" Florence suffers from strange spells when she's not herself, and becomes a tough femme fatale named Ann Bowman, ""dominatrix-empress of the planet Earth!,"" who likes nothing better than to enunciate her own name melodramatically and to shout orders at her male sex slaves. Florence's mother, a Joan Crawfordesque control freak, won't explain what's up with her troubled daughter. Meanwhile, some of the surfers in Florence's crowd can't seem to keep their hands off one another. And a strange killer is slaughtering people all over the place, striking largely at the physically imperfect...Charles Busch's successful off-off-Broadway stage play gets the full treatment here and is largely very successful. Very wisely, Busch, who played Chicklet onstage, stepped aside in favor of young Lauren Ambrose, later to be the star of HBO's ""Six Feet Under,"" and cast himself instead as the police detective, Monica Stark, investigating the murders. Monica is such an &uuml;bercompetent butch detective (with strangely thoughtful facial expressions) that everything Busch does or says is funny. Ambrose tries a bit too hard as Chicklet, but she's quite hilarious when she becomes possessed by the Ann Bowman persona (don't be surprised if afterwards you start reciting some of Ann's better, and more arch, bon mots: ""Bad boys need to be spanked... bad boys need to be TORtured!"").

520203,"There are not enough words to describe what Peter Jackson and his team have made to bring to life one of the most amazing stories ever told. There are thousands of thoughts, impressions, reviews and many kinds of things said about Tolkien's wonderful story. In my opinion, his tale is not jus about good and evil, but a recreation of the story of christianism, where there are martyrs willing to sacrifice, symbols to be feared and proteceted at all costs, a company of friends almost like apostles, making a pilgrimage to a distant land where evil is supreme.Peter Jackson was brilliant choosing to make three movies in one, and to film them all at once. Each part of the lord of the rings has a depth that of its own, and to condense the story in only one movie would be a disastrous crime. Either the story would have to be mutilated, or the movie would have to be twelve hours long. With three movies, there is enough space and time for everything in Tolkien's imagination to be brought to life and, which is better, accurately.The visual effects are simply fantastic (the Balrog being the most amazing one), worked on to the last and smallest details.New Zealand is a wonderful country and the right choice for the photography and photography effects, like the famous scene of the two stone-figures guarding the entrance of the river.The casting was appropriate also, a blend of old and proved talented actors and the new generation of stars of medium shine.Ian McKellen is, again, superb as Gandalf. Cate Blanchett and Liv Tyler are the beautiful ladies of the elven. Viggo Mortensen and Elijah Wood do their parts very well.

200586,"Noir fans may exalt Detour as the best cheapo road movie in film history, but the non-noirish Duel certainly has it beat in the suspense department. This is a tour-de-force of direction and editing that stretches a scanty plot into a breathless 90 minutes of edge-of-the-seat entertainment as Mann (man) duels tanker to the death. And where could the producers have located one of filmdom's scariest monsters?-- that rusting leviathan that could only have come from 18-wheeler hell. The movie itself confims what many of us only suspect: that heavy machinery operators should be psychologically tested before being loosed on the road.

Man wins because his more highly-evolved brain and agility will always best clumsy bulk and strength.

722127,"It's funny that ""Buffy the Vampire Slayer"" is already in its seventh season, when there was a time it didn't seem as if the show would even last seven episodes.  Only recently  (very recently) has ""Buffy"" finally started to lose steam, in terms of ratings, core fan loyalty, and critical acclaim.  The long-overdue DVD release of Season 3 should be a welcome reminder of what ""Buffy"" was like at its artistic and popular peak.  Season 2 of ""Buffy"" shattered all sorts of dramatic rules and managing to remain hilarious and poignant all at once.  Season 3 keeps rolling with the punches and duplicates those successes.We begin with a pair of episodes easing Buffy back into life in Sunnydale, after her traumatic exit in ""Becoming"".  ""Anne"" is a careful character piece, reintroducing Buffy to her relevance in the larger world, through a trip through Los Angeles' demon dimensions.  In ""Dead Man's Party"", a host of zombies comes to town and wrecks Buffy's house, just in time to salvage her disastrous homecoming party.""Faith, Hope and Trick"" is the first great episode of the year.  Faith, the new second Slayer, is introduced, as is Mr. Trick, the  season's first recurring villain -- Pimp Vampire Daddy.  Also along for the ride is Scott Hope, Buffy's human rebound boyfriend.  And, of course, Angel returns to life.  In ""All Men Are Beasts"", Buffy weighs her new boyfriend against the feral Angel, and Oz fights Sunnydale High's resident Jekyll/Hyde monster.The season arc continues in ""Homecoming"" and ""Band Candy"", two funny episodes which introduce Sunnydale's off-kilter Mayor (the witty Harry Groener).  A darker hint of things to come arrives in ""Relevations"" -- the first serious cracks in the prickly Faith's emotional armor, and the first hints that Giles will not be Buffy's Watcher forever.  This episode ends on a frustrating emotional disconnect between Buffy and Faith, and while this was unusual upon first viewing, in retrospect it's a powerful moment, fraught with the tragedy to come.""Lover's Walk"" is one of the season highlights, as last year's villain Spike returns to town.  It's amusing that all the regular characters suffer some defeat in this story, but Spike drives out of town singing along to Sid Vicious and obviously back on top of the world.  It'd be another year before he'd return, but Season 3 is, happily, strong enough to overcome his absence.""The Wish"" is Buffy's first look at alternate history, as Season 1's villain, The Master, is momentarily resurrected and a battle-scarred alter-Buffy can't quite defeat him.  In ""Amends"", billed as ""A Buffy Christmas"", it's Angel's turn to be redeemed from his past.""Gingerbread"", ""Helpless"", and ""The Zeppo"" are in a sense the last three stand-alone episodes of the series, which soon afterwards would roll over into more of a continuous soap-opera storyline.  That said, ""Zeppo"" is memorable for its Xander's-eye view of Sunnydale High, and in ""Helpless"", Giles is finally fired by the increasingly ominous Watcher's Council.Faith takes a screaming left turn toward the dark side of the Slayer force in ""Bad Girls"" and ""Consequences"", two of the rawest  hours of the season.  The ending of this two-parter reveals Faith's betrayal of Buffy, which in a sense stings more than Angel's conversion to evil the year before, because it is voluntary.In ""Enemies"" and ""Choices"", the Faith/Mayor Wilkins relationship develops.  The father/daughter chemistry between the season's two remaining villains sets them up among the pantheon of great ""Buffy"" baddies.  In between are two great solo episodes -- ""Dopplegangland"" (the one with the Evil Willow) and ""Earshot"", the first of two stories so raw and timely that it was yanked from the air due to its eerie prefiguring of the Columbine High School murders.  Oddly, ""The Prom"", a very funny hour, was spared this fate, even though it treads similar grounds.  The ""Class Protector"" trophy awarded Buffy is another of the show's finest bittersweet moments.The year ends with ""Graduation Day"", the culmination of the Faith and Mayor Wilkins storylines, and the final hours of the Scooby Gang as students at Sunnydale High.  Pay close attention to the final battle scene -- many recurring characters have their ultimate fates revealed in brief flashes way from the main action.While Season 4 of ""Buffy"", the next set due out (eventually), is terrific, Season 3 is for many the final year in which the show was, quite simply, perfect.",Buffy the Vampire Slayer - The Complete Third Season

Personally I found Enid to be despondent wreck, hell bent on lambasting others for their perceived injustices (read: success).  The parade of foil characters that attempted to sharply contrast her persona only reinforced my belief that not only was she clueless and without direction, but that she was simply melnacholy because she did not fit in.  Her acerbic demeanor, lack of depth or any altruistic conviction only proved that she wasn't motivated by a cause or struggle.  My belief is that her perpetual effort to rub popular culture the wrong way was in some way a combative response to not fitting in.  On that level this work was a mild success.

It's about three love-lost women (Cher, Pfeiffer and Sarandon) who, bored with small town life, shack up with The Devil (Nicholson) who offers them a world of sex, magic and enjoyment.  However, things soon begin to start spiralling out of control, and by that I mean the movie as well as the three girls' situation.It's not that the acting is bad.  Far from it, each member of the cast is perfect, especially Sarandon in an unusually sexy role.  The problem is that the movie can't balance its menacing elements with its funnier ones.  Much of this problem lies with Nicholson, who constantly is forced to move from scary to fun-loving.  Whilst the four leads are floating above a swimming pool or playing a magical game of tennis it skips along quite nicely.  However, this is all blown away with a ridiculously over-the-top finale which seems to waste all the movie's money on some very silly special effects.Still, Susan Sarandon in a funny role is a treat to behold.",N/A

I followed the script without much trouble.Have heard that some viewers didn't understand the film. Well, I don't know how much education those individuals have.....And the criticism of Aaliyah's character/acting. There was nothing that I could see that merited any such criticism. Her character was that of a African Goddess, a queen who was the most powerful of her kind. She had a relationship with Lestat__Which might be the reason why many felt ""uncomfortable"" with this movie. The relationship was in context with the storyline therefore I felt nothing was out of line there. But if it makes anyone feel better, she was evil, betrayed by those she trusted and was destroyed at the end.But she will return again!! And will avenge her betrayal.I would recommend this to anyone who is looking for good entertainment. It is typical vampire violence and may be a bit scary for younger viewers. But it is viewable.Let your hair down and enjoy it!!!!",N/A
701881,"I was thrilled when M*A*S*H season two was FINALLY released.  Afterall this season has the classic episode titled ""Five O'Clock Charlie"".  Just like the previous season we get 3 disks with 8 episodes on each disk for a total of the full 24 episode season.  (M*A*S*H had 24 episodes per season instead of the normal 13).  Other than scene and episode selection you get no special features which is fine and dandy with me since seeing the un-cut episodes of one of the greatest shows of all time is special feature enough.The ONLY problem period is Fox's release schedule.  The little piece of paper that the set came with said ""Continue Your Collection With Season 3 AVAILABLE WINTER 2003!"" 2003? Are they kidding me?  I need to get like Father Mulchahy and calm down and pray.  But that is an insane amount of time to wait.  I could see Winter 2002 but 2003 is just WAY to long for me.  Fox needs to get back on track here.At least we can watch M*A*S*H about four hours a day (if you have no life) since its on a lot.  I f you are a fan you need to own this set at almost any cost.

She plays a wide variety of characters that shows off her dynamics as an actress.The look of this movie is amazing, from the stunning imagery in the opening sequence (with the flower being crushed by the army of laborers going off to work), to the paradisiacal island where the volcano of the title is located.This movie is funny.

For Your Eyes Only brings 007 back to Earth from Moonraker and downplays the gadgets in this film. The new villian is Aristotle Kristatos. He is sophistically played by Julian Glover. He has stolen the ATAC system and with it, has a serious advantage in destroying any submarine! The new Bond girl is Melina Havelock. She is avenging the death of her parents at the hand of a hitman, Gonzalez hired by Kristatos. The music is fantastic in this film!!! Sheena Easton sings a melody that you just can't get out of your head! The only downpoint in this film is the missing appearance of ""M"" and the ridiculous dialogue between Blofeld and 007.

147268,"It's Jim Belushi's acting that saves this film, yet his character is too dumb to be credible, as is the premise of the film.  He's a vicious corrupt cop who doesn't check anything twice, just shoots and doesn't ask any questions--later or at any time.  Yet because of Belushi's strong acting talents, his character is almost believable.He and his partner, played by a wildly overacting Tupac Shakur, have a nasty profitable scam going:  they set up trades with drug dealers, then kill the latter for the drugs which they can sell again.  Here's another problem--any money cops use for set ups has to be authorized by higher ups, then accounted for.  There's no mention of that in the film; how do they get away with keeping the money?  It's also mentioned that they've pulled this 11 times.  OK, so after all those times, NOBODY on the force investigates how it is that so many drug dealers have died after a set up put in place by the same two cops over and over?  Also not credible.The two thug cops kill a drug dealer who turns out to be an undercover DEA agent and fellow DEA guy Gary Cole pulls in and starts hassling the precinct for answers.  Cole also overacts here; he's a caricature, not a character.However, as an upscale attorney, James Earl Jones does a fine job, as does Dennis Quaid as a surprising suspect the thug cops have framed for the murder of the DEA agent.  Yet the surprise that comes with discovering Quaid's real identity is another plot point that severely strains credibility.The film seems to be a collection of characters thrown together to flesh out a collection of random, often non-credible, and distinctly unrelated story segments that have not been thought through.  Even the ending is disappointing--you can smell it coming a mile away.In spite of all the above, this is not a bad film because the pacing and momentum are strong enough--along with the acting of Belushi, Jones, and Quaid--to carry it through to its predictable end.  Belushi is on screen most of the time and he's a lot of fun to watch.  You're thinking no cop can be that dumb, but his acting chops make you feel that if a guy could be this crude and vicious, then, OK, maybe he COULD be that dumb.A truly mixed bag.

The relaxing music, narration, and beautiful scenery of California's Death Valley will calm your mind.  While the challenging yoga routine will release tension in your muscles.  Patricia Walden's yoga routine mainly consists of lunges and balancing poses focusing on stretching the legs and back muscles.  Other yoga postures include child's pose, dog pose, proud warrior, and forward bends.  The balancing poses are difficult and challenging, and I was struggling to maintain my balance.  But I feel energized and more relaxed after I complete this routine.My only COMPLAINT with this video is that she does not hold the poses very long for a thorough stretch and the routine seems a bit rushed. In a yoga class, you would normally hold a pose for 2-3 minutes.  However, this video is advertised as a brief yoga workout.  If you want to simulate or replace yoga class with a video, this is NO replacement.  However, it is a great video for people with hectic lives because it is easier to make the time for a 20-minute video versus a 50-minute video.DISCLAIMER:  After reading a few other reviews, I think there is some confusion about what a ""beginners"" video should entail.  If you are excessively overweight, obese, or have any serious health problems--you should consult your doctor before beginning any new exercise regime.  Even though this tape says for ""beginners"" on the box, your health will determine your ability to complete any fitness program.

708016,"After hearing how bad Queen of the Damned was, I was somewhat surprised by how I enjoyed this film overall. It isn't in the same ballpark as the great Interview with a Vampire, but on its own it is worth it to watch.Among the problems it has is the lack of character development for all the main characters, including, to a lesser extent, Lestat. As that vampire re-awakens to become a rock star, we never get a real good sense of who he is, and why he's &quot;coming out of the coffin&quot; and revealing himself as a vampire to the world, a big no-no. But he's got more characterization than the queen of the damned herself, as well as his sort-of love interest, who wants to become a vampire.The pacing of the film also is off, I'm assuming because the plot is taken from a number of Anne Rice novels, not any one in particular. Though I never read them, I could feel the schizophrenia in the film and it made me wish they would have narrowed the plot down to one book.But despite these major flaws, there is still a good deal to appreciate. The world it takes place has the right, spooky atmosphere a good vampire film is supposed to possess, much of the cinematography is visually exciting, and the queen herself, when the rage takes her, is quite an exciting sight.Overall, this film has as many weakness as it does strengths, and it's unfortunate it's not better. But it's not as bad as many critics make it out to be. Worth at least one viewing, especially if you love vampires.",N/A
26264,"You're not smarter than everyone else for liking, or like me-loving, this movie. I admit that no one I have lent my copy to has yet liked this movie, and that's too bad (but thay are no less intelligent because of it). Years and years ago when I worked at one of those BIG video stores (which I will not name here), I used to try to talk people into taking back the movie they had selected in favor of Brazil. If they seemed reluctant then I would simply ruin the ending of the movie in their hand, and then assure them I was saving them time and money. The job was really boring, so I had to keep myself entertained. No one ever complained though...That aside, the movie is really stunning. It's the theatrical equivalent of a Dali painting, at least in theme. Terry Gilliam has done some impressive things in film, but this movie, at least to me-and some others- is a masterpiece. With out a doubt it is bizarre, and the fantasy world of Sam Lowry is only slightly less bizarre than the reality this movie asserts. Its first rate satire, as only the British can supply it(yes I know Terry is from the states, but he's pretty much an honorary brit), with a love story that doesn't need to be believable for this movie to work. There's so much social commentary, that for it's time was ahead of it's time: a child asking Santa for a credit card for Christmas, Sam's mother and mothers friend trying to one-up each other in plastic surgery. Outrageous. Why can't Hollywood make movies like this? Fight Club was a good effort, but it tried too hard to be cool, and somehow tainted the over all quality of that film (which is not the point here). The Robert DeNiro cameo was so unexpected that it felt like a cavalry charge, and it worked so well because that's what his character represented.The movie meanders on from one daydream to another, one bit of faux-reality to another, until it becomes difficult to tell one from the other. Its bleak landscapes are quite intentional, and serve well to crush the viewer with the monstrosity of modern living. Quality of life becomes a real question as the movie takes you through its paces, and caters to ones deepest anxieties about life in the near-future. But to say this movie is depressing does it little justice. At times it can be uplifting. It's just not Hollywood fluff spoon fed to you, which is ironic being that the consumer is the hand that feeds them. A mutually parasitic relationship perhaps? Who can say...I could still watch this movie many times over, and really regret not to have been able to see it in the theatre, where movies get their best treatment anyways. Still I try to get others to enjoy this movie as much as I do, but it seems destined to be a cult classic, which to me has so many negative connotations. So buyer/renter beware. But I really don't think this movie should be a source of elitism, which also has its own negative connotations. I myself am an idiot, and still I love this flick, so maybe there is hope for the world yet!",N/A

703129,"What do you get when you mesh unblinking eyes, priests with webbed fingers and innkeepers with gilled throats, fishermen with a strange affinity for covering their faces, plenty of gold from the depths of the sea to go with the atypical ""bounty from the deep,"" a few faces getting peeled off to teach someone a lesson, a bit of octopi legging to replace those pesky bipedal ones, and one ancient tentacled God? No, it isn't your local barnyard sock-hop taking place at some yokel fairground, its Stuart Gordon's latest creation, the Lovecraft inspired Dagon!Unlike many of Gordon's earlier, more goofy approaches to the horrific, this Shadows Over Innsmouth/Dagon recount wore a dark overcoat that shrouded almost all of the production. The tale begins with Paul (Ezra Godden) and his girlfriend Barbara, accompanied by two friends, as they toast the success of their new company off the coast of Spain. Paul finds himself plagued by dreams of the foulest sort, ones dealing with an underwater monument bearing a strange insignia and a half-fish/half-humanoid woman, the type that end with him awakening (once again) in a pool of sweat and screams. Soon after our introduction, a storm, if you can call the suddenly conceived, quickly overwhelming beast darkening the sky and tossing their boat around like a bath toy ""a storm,"" impales their boat upon a black reef that any Lovecraft fan will well appreciate. This, in turn, injures one of the boat's occupants and forces them to seek help in a decrepit fishing town called Imboca. As they approach the town in their cheaply construed rubber lifeboat their woes begin, with the sound of gunfire coming from the ship and something brushing against their raft and knocking a hole in it. Is this sign of something to come? Well, in a world where the beasts run rampant in the water, you bet it is. The two quickly find themselves in a town that first seems deserted, a place where the churches read ""Esoterica Orde De Dagon"" and the occupants, once they are finally found, seem to grow odder and odder by the minute. All these things come together and finally lead them toward secrets that no Bostonian before them ever really wanted to learn, the truth behind the worshippers of Dagon.Touting nice effects in the monster category, some decent acting (Godden reminding me a lot of Jeffrey Combs, a great thing in my book), pieces of comedy to go with the more horrific, Deep One inspired portions of the movie, and some nice looking DVD quality, this is something to pick up and watch a few time. I highly recommend it for those who've always wanted augmentation by making deals with the oddities of underwater worship or for those simply wanting to stroll the beaches of human suffering as casual passerbys. It'll give you more reasons than the mere shark to stay away from the ocean.",Dagon

Slowly, members of the cast and crew begin disappearing, indicating the killer is still lurking in the halls of Crippen High.The killer did not do enough slashing, he should have had a stab at this cliched script. All the film makers' characters have been done before. The director is all artistic frenzy, the producer is a sleazy scumbag, the screenwriter is ignored, and the actors are shallow.

This plays like rejected scenes from ""Harriet the Spy,"" as they happen on a conversation, whip out a notebook, and nod and write.

One problem I've had with all kinds of computer animation is that everything comes out so clean.  This animation takes the time to dirty up it's characters a little bit, providing more realism, which I like.The movie's also terrific in that it does work at both the adult and child levels.  The kids will like seeing some of their favorite fantasy characters in another context.  While they may have less than pleasant personalities in this movie, I don't think that's going to emotionally scar our nation's youth, and the adults can enjoy the many zingers that get thrown in.But the familiar characters take a back seat to the brand new creations of this story.  Eddie Murphy as the donkey is great, if standard sidekick material.  But the animation of the Shrek character is more enjoyable with each viewing.  We've had slobs as heroes before, but never has such delightfully rude behavior been so incorporated into a lifestyle.  How Shrek brushes his teeth, catches fish for dinner, and provides a candle to light his dinner table are done so well they may become the new way of polite society.Well, maybe just in the movies.

The scary thing is that Enough actually featured a talented cast, with Juliette Lewis, Noah Wyle and yes, even Jennifer Lopez, yet none of them were watchable, the performances were uninspiring and boring.Let's face it, domestic thrillers have been done numerous times before, unfortunately Enough didn't do anything new to set itself apart from the others in the same genre.

217584,"In the ranking of American playwrights Clifford Odets is usually placed in the second tier behind Eugene O'Neill, Arthur Miller, Lillian Hellman and Tennessee Williams.  His output was something less than theirs and his two best-known plays, Waiting for Lefty and The Country Girl, never quite reached the artistic pinnacle of say, Miller's Death of a Salesman or Williams's A Streetcar Named Desire.  Nonetheless as a movie The Country Girl is a brilliant piece of work thanks in part to a fine adaptation by director and screenwriter George Seaton (Oscar for best screen adaptation, 1954) and sterling performances by Grace Kelly, Bing Crosby and William Holden.  Seeing this for the first time I was almost as much impressed by Holden, who played a part very much in keeping with his character and with other parts he has played, as I was by Kelly and Crosby who both did 180 degree turns in type-casting.Grace Kelly won an Oscar as the faithful, strong-willed, bitter, dowdy co-dependent wife of crooner Crosby who played a whimpering, guilt-ridden alcoholic.  You have to see Grace Kelly in the bags-under-her-eyes make-up and spinster get-ups to believe it.  She looks at least ten years older than her 25 years with a sour puss of a face and an attitude to match.  I think she won best actress (over Judy Garland in A Star Is Born) partly because her appearance was so stunningly...different.  (While I'm musing, I wonder if this was the film of hers that was banned in Monaco.)  It would seem to be the height of creative casting to put her into such a role, yet she is excellent, wonderful to watch as always, her timing exquisite, her expression indelible, and her sense of character perfect.  When she says to Holden, ""You kissed me--don't let that give you any ideas,"" and then when we see her face after he leaves, loving it, we believe her both times.Bing Crosby too is a sight to behold in what must have been his finest 104 minutes as a dramatic actor.  He too played way out of character and yet one had the sense that he knew the character well.  He was absolutely pathetic as the spineless one.  (In real life Der Bingo was reportedly a stern task master at home--ask his kids.)  Clearly director Seaton should be given some of the credit for these fine performances.  When your stars perform so well, it's clear you've done something right.The production suffers--inevitably, I suppose--from the weakness of the play within the play. Crosby is to be the star of a Broadway musical called ""The Land Around Us.""  (What we see of the musical assures us it's no Oklahoma!)  He's a little too old and stationary for the part, but of course he sings beautifully. (Painful was the excruciatingly slow audition scene opening the movie with Crosby singing and walking through a thoroughly boring number.)  Holden is the director and he is taking a chance on Crosby partly because he believes in him and partly because he has nobody else.  Naturally if Crosby returns to the bottle, everything will fall apart.What about the nature of alcoholism as depicted by Odets?  Knowing what we now know of the disease, how accurate was his delineation?  I think he got it surprising right except for the implied cause.  Crosby's character goes downhill after the accidental death of his son, which he blames on himself.  Odets reflects the belief, only finally dispelled in recent decades, that alcoholism was indicative of a character flaw, as he has Crosby say he used his son's death as an excuse to drink. Today we know that alcoholism is a disease, a chemical imbalance.  Yet Odets knew this practical  truth (from the words he puts into the mouth of William Holden's character): an alcoholic stops drinking when he dies or when he gives it up himself.  It is interesting to note that as a play The Country Girl appeared in 1950, the same year as William Inge's Come Back, Little Sheba, which also dealt with alcoholism.  The intuitive understanding of alcoholism by these two great playwrights might be compared with the present scientific understanding.  (See for example, Milam, Dr. James R. and Katherine Ketcham.  Under the Influence: A Guide to the Myths and Realities of Alcoholism [1981] or  Ketcham, Katherine, et al.  Beyond the Influence: Understanding and Defeating Alcoholism [2000].)Here's a curiosity: the duet song (best number in the movie; Crosby sang it with Jacqueline Fontaine) has the lyric ""What you learn is you haven't learned a thing,"" which is what the alcoholic learns everyday.And here's a familiar line, cribbed from somewhere in the long ago: Fontaine asks Crosby aren't you so-and-so, and he replies, ""I used to be.""",The Country Girl VHS

He falls in love with a girl named Mary, they get married, (I warn you, don't try some of the antics he does.) and George becomes a banker. His business runs short on money and he tries all he can to get it booming again, with a few obstacles along the way. On account of a guardian angel, George gets to see what the town would be like without him (Hey man, why wish that in the first place?  NEVER feel discouraged.)  But it all comes to a happy ending, with the full company on screen.Try this classic for yourself.",N/A

331215,"I bought this video after using Gin Miller's Best of Step Reebok TV workout.  These two videos are very different.  Whereas the Best of video is informal with a lot of vocal interaction and silliness among the steppers, this video reminds me of Orwell's &quot;1984.&quot;  The background steppers are nameless with blank expressions. Gin Miller is among the steppers counting down moves with hand signals while the instructor is Miller's face on a TV screen.  The steppers seem to be stepping on metal grating with light shining from below.  A live African band provides the pumping music.  The setting is very industrial.Whereas the atmosphere is a little intimidating, the workout is not.  The moves (including arm movements) are very simple and are done with a lot of repetition.  The first part of the workout I would classify as beginner/lower intermediate (one can always add propulsion, of course).  After the heart rate check, the workout gets a little more heart-pounding with a challenging lunge and straddle combination.The last segment of the workout includes 3 sets of pushups,lat pull downs, and ab crunches.  The ab crunches seem a littleskimpy for me (about 4 different crunches at only 8 reps each with rests in between.  I usually do crunches straight through).A good workout that is not too challenging but also doesn't leave you feeling that you cheated yourself.",Step Reebok: The Video VHS
660410,"Marshall Thompson is the sole surviving member of the first expedition to Mars (in 1973  -  Americans were very optimistic, in 1958), and the second expedition is bringing him back to Earth for court-martial on suspicion of having turned Alfred Packer to survive the harsh Martian clime.  Thompson's story is that an unseen Martian animal killed his men.  (Pfft - !  Who hasn't heard that one, before?)  It isn't too long before the second ship's crew believes him, however, because Thompson's never-glimpsed beastie has hitched a ride back to Earth with them, and is an especially violent killer...This was the inspiration for the much more famous Alien, twenty years later, and surprisingly is almost as good.  The production is imminently cheaper, of course, but that hardly matters.  The Martian monster (stuntman Ray ""Crash"" Corrigan in a fairly convincing zippered rubber suit with especially nasty claws) is pretty ghastly and near-indestructible, and creative use of light and shadow enhance its menace.  The cast perform with conviction, and are generally more believable than the standard stock characters usually attached to this sort of thing.  The effective soundtrack is lifted straight from the preceding year's almost equally good sci-fi B-flick, Kronos.",N/A
215685,"This masterful adaptation of Joseph Conrad's Heart of Darkness is an intriguing look into the mind confronted with madness.  As Martin Sheen's Cpt. Willard tells us, the story is about his journey as well as about Marlon Brando's Col. Kurtz.  The story takes place in Vietnam and Cambodia during the war rather than in Africa.The scenes Coppola gives us are unnerving.  The way Brando fades in and out of darkness, and eventually Sheen, creates in us an almost physical response to their touch with madness.  Are these characters mad or are they giving a sane reaction to the madness in their surroundings?  Everyone is trying to survive the horror of the war, but by embracing that horror, these two characters somehow make some sense of it themselves.This is an intense film, and I highly recommend it.",N/A

Jackson loses everything and is hell-bent on revenge.

695415,"You know, I normally have no use for romantic comedies--let alone romantic comedies that revolve around quasi-obscure cultural traditions--but this was--I must admit--quite good.  This is largely due to the fact that its creators saw fit to insert some actual *comedy,* rather than just the cutesiness which typically passes for humor in these affairs, in spite of not being at all funny.  The fact that the characters are, by and large, well-drawn helps too, and including the cab driver (the only one in London, apparently) as a central, unifying figure was a good idea that worked.  I cannot help but compare Born Romantic to Sidewalks of New York, a film I hated (two stars was a bit generous, methinks).  That film was also an ensemble piece examining multiple relationships, but it got bogged down in its self-satisfied smugness, never allowing the charaters to actually be people.  This, on the other hand, does; it has a relatively unaffected charm that made it a highly enjoyable experience (of course, it also didn't hurt that it appealed to my inner anglophile either).

504869,"*I cannot really ''praise,'' per se, the originality or story of the film ''Virus,'' because, in all honesty, it's not what anyone can rightly call a great film. Sure, it's visually stunning and fun and enjoyable and all that... but it's certainly not ''Terminator'' or ''Aliens.''Even so, I'm somewhat puzzled that so many reviewers are having a difficult time ''relating'' to this movie, based upon how it plays itself out. I think they are missing one key element in the whole thing, however:Just as ADULT reviewers have to be reminded that ''Santa Claus Conquers the Martians'' was a movie made for the tiny tot audience, reviewers of the movie ''Virus'' need to keep in mind that this film was based on a ''comic book'' story (...or as ''fanboys''-- current and former --would call it, a ''graphic novel'')!Anyone who pays any amount of attention would realize that there is NEVER (or rarely ever) going to be a ''totally straight'' presentation of a comic book story translated to the big screen -- even if the story itself is treated ''seriously'' within the pages of the comic. (''The Crow'' was one of those rarest of exceptions.)Keeping that in mind may actually make viewing this movie about an alien energy lifeform that....??? uses human bodies for ''spare parts'' ???...., and tries to kill them off more effectively by constructing cybernetic monstrosities???.... okay, so it's a little ludicrous, but again, I don't think it was meant to be taken completely seriously -- it's mindless escapism that's both fun and scary.

What I liked most about this movie was allll of the secondary characters... Kyra was the PERFECT Older sister looking out for her younger one, Gena was Great as the Southern Belle Mama, the Aunt (don't know this woman's name)was HILARIOUS as the ""little"" crazy Aunt that would/could go there. You really have to pay attention to this movie there are so many innuendos and funny moments that I truly can recommend this one. The actress that played the daughter was wonderful and last but not least Dennis Quaid did quite a convincing job as a contrite husband (once he was caught).If you want something along this plot line I would also suggest ""Hope Floats"" which also stars Gena Rowlands and has pretty much the same subject matter but not the same movie.

417441,"This was a brilliantly frustrating film about a confused man named Howard Campbell (Nolte), a brilliant if ill-fated playwright who led an ambiguous life for an American in wartime Germany.  Recruited as a deep-cover allied spy, Campbell ingratiated his way into the inner circles of the Nazi high command, then passed his secrets to our side through special coded messages.  Unfortunately, to earn the Nazis' good graces while providing an open avenue to transmit his secrets, Campbell becomes a German propaganda hero - ""The Last Free American"".  His cover proves too convincing by war's end, earning Campbell a spot next to ""Lord Haw-Haw"" and ""Ezra Pound"" in the victorious allies' hall of shame.  Though victorious, the allies maintain the secret of Campbell's wartime service against the Nazis, mostly because disclosure would muck up America's complicated post-war position (i.e., the ""cold war"").  Others, chiefly an OSS officer named Frank Virtanen (Goodman) are less convinced that Campbell's act was really an act, doubting that Campbell himself would have revealed himself to the Nazis had they won the war.  Campbell suffers a quiet obscurity in `50's NY, until a resurgent band of Nazis plucks him out of hiding, returning him to the public eye and its scorn.  Campbell finds himself targeted by thugs who may work for the Russians, while being essentially spat upon by everybody else.  In a twist, the only asylum he can find is with the Nazis - especially painful because their devotion undermines the only source of strength he has left: his belief in his own innocence.This was a brilliant film in that it works to achieve two seemingly opposite ends - both to exonerate and condemn the hapless Campbell.  On the one hand, we never fall for the idea of Campbell really would have thrown in his lot with the Nazis had America lost WWII.  On the other hand, like Campbell, the Nazis were also self-invented figures - actors who took their roles as genocidal supermen too seriously.  Though revealing their secrets to the allies, Campbell's propaganda-laden messages inspired the Nazis to press on, even as their shattered armies contracted further into the defeated Reich.  Years later, Campbell is forced to consider the possibility that his mission and intentions may not have been enough to outweigh the harm inflicted by a Nazi assault that took its stage cues from ""The Last Free American"".It's a challenge the script doesn't quite meet.  It would have been better had the Yanks kept Campbell on its public-enemy list because they shared Virtanen's suspicions - cold-war intrigue just seems a cheat.  The post-war Nazis themselves seem darkly laughable, but laughable is laughable, like an episode of ""Hogan's Heroes"" scripted by Roald Dahl.  A cell of these guys turns out to be, unsurprisingly, a group of old men who spend less time planning their conquest of eastern Europe than watching old propaganda movies -  including some vintage reels starring Campbell.  (I think there's something of a joke in that the decrepit surroundings in which the old Nazis take refuge is meant to recall the ""Secret Annex"" from ""The Diary of Anne Frank"".)  The frustration comes at the end when Campbell loses his faith in himself.  By then, despite signs that even the hard-hearted Virtanen may rise to his defense, Campbell surrenders himself to the Israelis for the purpose of being tried for his crimes.  Sharing an Israeli cell next to Adolf Eichman. Campbell bares the ultimate and final insult.  Though the film seeks to clear and condemn Campbell, the ending seems an unambiguous conviction.  So much for the good war, says Vonnegut.This was a great movie, with winning (if subdued) performances by Goodman and Nolte, but also Ala Arkin as a character who seems to suggest the Yossarian character he played in ""Catch-22"".  Also watch for Vonnegut himself as an unspeaking character Campbell encounters during his denoument.",Mother Night VHS

453650,"This film has features akin to many mediocre science fiction films, in that it establishes an inherently interesting premiss, but fails to portray its protagonist as a credible, fully realised character.  Whatever 'journey' or development this character then undertakes seems obvious and almost inevitable, to the point of being unsatisfying.  The plot becomes similarly devoid of surprises.  Watching this might also be compared with viewing an 'escape' movie (i.e from a prison, or prisoner-of-war camp),  where very quickly you know where everything is headed - the pleasure then becomes that of the details, the mood, and unexpected insights into people's behaviour under stress (see 'Le Trou' for a classic example) - unfortunately, 'The Truman Show' is not strong on any of these counts.*Jim Carrey has a very limited talent.  He seems like a caricature of himself, every facial expression, every bodily gesture, being exaggerated.  This is fine for generating a certain kind of humour (Jerry Lewis did something similar), but it seems less than ideal as a technique for evincing audience empathy.  His casting here is regrettable.  I can imagine people leaping to his defence, but just imagine if this film starred an actor capable of rendering a complex personality, a personality riven with conflicting emotions and desires, rather than the 'one-emotion-at-a-time' style of Carrey - think Jeff Bridges (who appeared in Weir's 'Fearless'), or if you want go for broke, a young Marlon Brando.*What is more (or less), every other character is limited in depth and humanity.  Ed Harris, blank-faced veteran of such unreflective films as 'The Firm' and 'Apollo 13', gives a one, or possibly two, dimensional performance as producer turned god (perhaps this is forgivable as humanity has never been a notable quality of producers or gods).*Weir is at his best being suggestive.  'The Last Wave' is brilliant in this regard.  He's great at certain brooding atmospheres - see also 'Witness', or 'Picnic at Hanging Rock'.  Here, however, he is being didactic (tediously so) and the atmosphere is cheesy grins and half-baked sentimentalism - not his, or anyone else's,  forte.*So, be careful with this film.  It seems to have scored high marks with the critics, and technicians such as 'script doctors', because it is 'more intelligent' than the average Hollywood product - well, yes, but when you're talking 'Hollywood' and 'intelligence' then you're talking about a very low average.*My vote for a truly great contemporary American film goes to David Lynch's 'Mulholland Drive'.",N/A

531695,"I am still laughing about this movie, even though I saw it several days ago! I have never seen a film that makes simple-mindedness, male modeling and the fashion industry so entertaining.This is easily Ben Stiller's most hilarious offering. Through mind-numbingly idiotic international male supermodel Derek Zoolander, Stiller both skewers and winks at the world's modeling/fashion industry.The plot: As the Malaysian Prime Minister prepares to raise wages for his country's impoverished workers, the powerful fashion magnates who rely on cheap labor prepare to strike back. Fashion designer Mugatu is ordered to dispose of the prime minister via an extremely dimwitted patsy, who comes along in the form of  Derek Zoolander.Zoolander becomes the perfect candidate when he looses VH1's Male Model Of The Year Award to archrival Hansel (Owen Wilson), and becomes disillusioned with the fashion industry. But, that's nothing an orange flavored coffee drink cant fix! Life is like a video for Zoolander, whether carousing with similarly dimwitted friends, working in a coal mine or facing down archrivals in back-alley 'walk-offs'.Words cannot describe the entertainment value of seeing Derek Zoolander, male supermodel, working in a coal mine with his father (jon Voight), played strangely like Christopher Walken. I almost fell off the couch.There are few genuinely smart characters in this film, but their presences only serve to make the rediculous heroes (and villains) more hilarious. Christina Taylor plays Zoolander's love interest, an intellectual reporter with Time magazine who finds out about the plot to destroy the Malaysian P.M. Jerry Stiller plays the soft-hearted owner of Balls Models, a reluctant participant in Mugatu's scheme. Finally, Saturday Night Live's outrageous Will Ferrell plays Mugatu, the evil fashion designer who programs Zoolander to do the dirty deed. I don't understand how any of the cast made this movie-I would not have been able to keep a straight face.Most of the extras in this film are, were or can be associated with the modeling/fashion/entertainment industry. Some are mentioned by name, but you can catch others if you are careful and knowledgeable about such things.There is not enough space to gush about this movie.

682359,"I was expecting ""The Anniversary Party"", co-written and co-directed by Alan Cumming and Jennifer Jason Leigh, to be a loosely-scripted, improv-heavy excuse for a bunch of their actor friends to get together in front of the camera and show off their instruments.  What I found instead was a semi-tightly plotted dissection of a marriage teetering on the brink of dissolution, a commentary on the nature of celebrity in a celebrity-saturated market, and a worthy exhibition of exhilaration and pathos.  That is until the film's last hour, which degenerates into a loosely-scripted, improv-heavy excuse for a bunch of actors friends to get together in front of the camera and show off their instruments.  Ad nauseum.Simply structured into five easily-defined segments, the film begins with many gestures of goodwill, which are slowly stripped away as it refuses to finally end.The prologue introduces Joe Therrian (Cumming) and Sally Nash (Leigh).  The first shots of the film feature a sleeping Cumming being observed by Leigh in bed, on the morning of their sixth wedding anniversary.  This segues into a quiet little scene where they both do yoga in the backyard.  These two moments, as well as a later bedroom scene, establish the pair's relationship instantly, while also subtly alluding to important plot points to come.  This is the film's strength, its use of moments and details, picked up only by the most observant viewer, that define character instantly and allude to moments to come.  It is because of this that the film holds up well on second viewing.The next segment shows Joe and Sally greeting their various guests as they arrive for the anniversary party.  Just as Joe and Sally are introduced in tableau during the film's first scenes, so do these short moments explicate the well-defined relationships between the guests and their hosts.  It's the kind of crowd that features both a recent Oscar winner, and a former Booker Prize recipient, a menagerie of talented and egocentric personalities that is vibrant and entertaining, promising at least some good times ahead.  For the most part, they deliver.Once everyone has arrived, the party begins, made up of two long sequences that do an awful lot in terms of defining character, and, especially in the second one, constructing Joe and Sally's backstory.The first is a rousing game of charades, that some take way too seriously (ratcheting up the tension) while others treat as a lark.  It's notable for the way relationships are further cemented, and for the way it sets new ones down a rocky path.The second sequence has everyone stand up in front of the crowd, one by one, presenting either a song or a joke or a dance number as an ode to Joe and Sally.  There were one too many songs, for my liking, especially since each said basically the same thing (we're glad you're back, Joe, don't ever leave our Sally again).  Kevin Kline and daughter do a wonderful balletic interpretive dance of Joe and Sally's marriage.  The little girl appears to be having the time of her life, adopting a mock serious face between bouts of cracking up.  Kline, to his credit, lets her steal the spotlight.  Mostly, this sequence is useful in that it manages to get all the things better left unsaid out in the open, as some of the guests inadvertently peel back the skin of the couple of the hour, the better to expose their inner wounds.It is dubious, however, for the last person to present, Paltrow's Davidson, thinks it a good deal to offer 15 capsules of Ecstasy to this erratic group.  From this point on, the film is a train wreck masquerading as theatre of the absurd.Now, I'm all for giving a repressed group, one with issues as delicious as these people's, an opportunity to bear their souls.  But when that opportunity is only achieved through chemistry, it feels like cheating to me.  The revelations are tainted in some way.  Which is exactly what happens here.The other problem is that this section of the movie goes on and on and on.  It tramples over nearly all the goodwill that Cumming and Leigh worked so hard to build up over the film's first half.  What was once a prudently structured little film, turns violently into a jumbled mess.  Most obnoxious here is Cumming and Leigh's little blow up scene.  Every other word is a curse; every line is punctuated by implausible hysterics and tears.  These are two wonderful actors, who've just finished proving that during the film's first half.  Poof.  All gone.  It's an unwatchable scene, one that a more seasoned director would have guided home much more ably.Once the Ecstasy has worn off (ironically, the ecstasy of the film wore off just as Ecstasy the drug made its appearance), the film can get down to the business of finally ending.  Hold your horses!  There's the denouement to consider.  Or was it an epilogue?  No matter.Where conventionally closure should exist, one last wrench is thrown into the works, and somehow, this brings peace and resolution to the characters.  I didn't think it possibly, but Cumming and Leigh almost save this mess.  Still, I didn't buy the peace and resolution this last bit brought on.  Thankfully, I suspect the filmmaker's don't either.  The last shot, which bears a striking resemblance to the film's first shot, shows that the issues are left unresolved.  What we have is a just a temporary ceasefire.In the end, ""The Anniversary Party"" is little more than a vanity piece by Cumming and Leigh, an opportunity to make a personal film on the cheap, about some particularly vain people.  Which, I suppose, makes the whole endeavor rather appropriate.  If you dare R.S.V.P. to this ""Party"", take my advice and leave just after the sun goes down.",N/A
289476,"Ken Burns' eleven-hour epic brilliantly captures the tragedy of the American Civil War through folksy historians, celebrity voice-overs, searing photography, and the eloquent letters and diaries of everyday soldiers and civilians on both sides of the conflict.It has been said often enough that to truly understand the American spirit, one must study the U.S. Civil War.  In a four-year microcosm, the war summed up all the best in the United States.  Namely, the abolition of race-based chattel slavery, the vindication of democracy in a republican form of goverment in an era dominated by European monarchs, the incredible bravery of the Union and Confederate soldiers, and the sheer political and intellectual brilliance of men like Abraham Lincoln and Frederick Douglass.  Likewise, the war also displayed some of America's worst characteristics:  the vicious 1863 Draft Riots in New York City, the draft exemptions for the rich--both North and South, the 1864 massacre of 300 black Union soldiers by the Confederate army (and Robert E. Lee's refusal to stop similar racist carnage in the future), and Sherman's brutal campaign against civilians in Georgia and South Carolina.In eleven, sprawling hours, Burns and writer Geoffrey C. Ward capture the essence of the war and of the American spirit, and how the war united the country, but yet still divides it.  This is no small feat, and Burns' documentary is truly magnificent.That being said, Burns focuses just a little too much on slavery being the cause of the war (it wasn't).  The real cause was federal power versus state power.  Simply put, the South didn't think the North had any right to tell it what to do--and was convinced that the federal government was a stooge for Northern interests.  If you don't believe me, look to the fact that the U.S. nearly had a civil war over tariffs in the 1830s.  Ken Burns conveniently didn't put THAT in his documentary, but liberty and human freedom undoubtedly make a more compelling story than how much in tax you can charge to imported goods from France.  However, in all fairness, slavery (as well as Lincoln's election in 1860) was the straw the broke the camel's back (so to speak) and it was the preeminent moral and political issue of the mid-19th Century in America.The DVD extras are somewhat insightful.  Ken Burns himself comes across as a stale personality and isn't very interesting.  George Will calls the war ""the greatest war in history"".  Not true, I think the Persian Wars, Punic Wars, 30 Years War, Napoleonic Wars and World Wars I and II all outrank our civil war, but it's interesting fuel for debate.  The best interview is Stanley Crouch of the ""New York Daily News"" who gives a very candid view on the war and why Robert E. Lee is ""overrated"".",N/A

546323,"This season is the beginning of what was to come for ""The X-Files"". Unlike all other seasons, this one is not spliced together with the classic alien mythology episodes the series is now famous for. Instead, it's an entire season of stand-alone episodes, spare a few alien stories. Although lacking the wonderful mythology arc, this season began the classic X-Files formula and changed TV forever. Starting with the excellent Pilot episode, each episode is a monster-of-the-week type thing, a kind of homage to shows like ""The Twilight Zone"". The elements are all in place: the dark atmosphere, the creepy plots, and great cinematography. The first half of the season is okay, despite a few lost efforts such as ""The Jersey Devil"" and ""Ghost in the Machine"". The series really picks up with ""Ice"", placing Mulder and Scully in the arctic with parasitic worms. The last half of the season is more entertaining, with more intriguing stories. While the lack of the mythology arc puts a damper on the season, the stand-alone episodes are some of the classics. ""Eve"", ""Fire"", ""Beyond the Sea"", ""Tooms"", etc. All are great episodes that stand out to establish a medium for ""The X-Files"". Probably the most serious season, it lacks some of the bubbly humor and comedic efforts that follow in later seasons. No casual jokes are exchanged between Mulder and Scully and the most emotional episode is probably ""Beyond the Sea"", which deals with the death of Scully's father. The season wraps up its scattered alien episodes with what some consider the first true mythology episode ""The Erlenmeyer Flask"". Despite being a terrific episode that launchs the series and is the stepping stone for seasons to come, it's a great season finale, maybe the best episode of the season. While its rigidness and seriousness brings it down a bit, this is classic television. And besides, fans didn't know what was to come and knew next to nothing of the mythology. This is the season that starts it all. Everything is set up, the potential is there, and a phenomenon is born.",The X-Files - The Complete First Season
533976,"&quot;Enemy At The Gates&quot; was an excellent and carefully planned war film. I have read an incredible amount of negative reviews on this movie and I can say just one thing about it - it's one of the greatest movies I have ever seen, because it is realistic - more so than in other war movies. &quot;Enemy At The Gates&quot; portrays the Russians and the Germans exactly the way they were back then in World War II.The setting of the film is wonderful - showing Stalingrad as a city of ruins destroyed by the war and bombs. The actors are all wonderful - their intensity and psychological emotions are shown right there in their faces. I think the actors have done an excellent job on making this movie come alive and seem real - it worked! Even the romance between Tanya (Rachel Weisz) and Vassilli (Jude Law) is shown realistically. There were no sweet and sappy romantic scenes like in true Hollywood movies. These were too tough and harsh times to get really carried away with passion.The story is definitely interesting and original as well. It depicts a duel between two excellent snipers, Konig and Zaitsev. Amidst the brutal conditions in the ruins of Stalingrad, the two snipers seek each other out all the time, making the movie full of suspense and intensity.All in all, I think this movie IS worthy of 5 stars I am giving it. Definitely. Just see it for yourself and you will see what I am talking about! Go for it and watch it - you won't regret!",Enemy At the Gates

549819,"Mercifully, Woody Allen appears in this film only as one of many narrators--all either jazz critics or DJ's--which is why I was willing to watch it at all. Unlike the films, post Annie Hall, in which the unbeautiful Allen invariably plays a ""romantic"" lead, he has, this time out, stayed out of the camera's way to create what amounts to a biopic of legendary, yet little-known, guitarist Emmett Ray--considered by many to be the second greatest jazz guitarist ever, after Django Rheinhardt.Penn's performance as the gambling, drunken, pimping, egocentric, unfeeling Ray (who faints at the sight of Django and weeps at the sound of his music) is just terrific. Better yet is Samantha Morton's portrait of the mute Hattie, with whom Ray lives off and on for a number of years. In truth, this is Morton's movie. She is heartbreakingly good as the forever-eating, lovestruck young woman who, at the sound of Penn's/Ray's rendition of ""I'm Forever Blowing Bubbles"" loses her heart.The music is the other star of this film; it is great stuff--a soundtrack worth having for lovers of early jazz. And if the Ray tracks are anything to go by, he was, indeed, the second greatest guitarist of our times.A film worth seeing.",N/A
166968,"There is absolutely no other way to put this film...it is simply hilarious!Known as Italy's clown prince, the actor is a writer, director and producer who often uses his wife Nicoletta Braschi in his films.  It's clear to see whose his comedic influences are, namely Charlie Chaplin, Peter Sellers.  His international success came with the drama/comedy Life is Beautiful.  His more popular work is in the American film, Night on Earth, Down By Law, and the ever so hilarious Italian film Johnny Stecchino.This is beyond Chaplinesque, far superior, in another light!  The premise of the story is mistaken identity.  Loris is a meek and mild school bus driver who is mistaken for the serial killer who the police stake out a plan to nab him soon!  A beautiful woman from the force is part of the stakeout plan, and intently, she hooks up with him to catch him in the act!This is nonstop action of brilliant comedic scenes, such as the police tape as they have Loris under surveillance to prove he is a pervert and it's exactly what they get, innocent behavior that comes off perverted.  There isn't a way to describe that, it is just hilarious.  Then you have the grocery store theft with a bulging trench coat,  trying to put an unclothed female mannequin in the trunk of the car,  pretense of making a phone call with a video remote,  the Chinese interview, and especially the dinner party scene, the attempt at seduction by the female, etc. etc.The subtitles are easy to read, so don't freak if you haven't seen subtitles.

484461,"I have several of the graphic paperbacks from the X/1999 clamp production.  I've read and puzzled over those, and now I have spent several hours with this DVD.  There comes a point in the quest for value where one has to finally ponder why a work is the way it is.  I don't expect every DVD or book to be a work of art, but I do expect that each such effort have some sense of its purpose or potential value.In the case of 'X', I confess I am mystified.  On the surface, a young man (Kamui) returns to Tokyo at the behest of his dying mother to defend those he loves.  But he fails to defend Kotori, who loves him, and forces his friend Fuuma to make impossible choices.  On the layer below this Kamui and Fuuma are doomed to become the primary antagonists in a struggle over whether the human race should be allowed to survive.  In the ensuing fight, shared with the other dragons of heaven and earth, the destruction is sufficient to wonder whether the cure is worse than the disease.In truth, the plot is a pre-ordained ballet of opposing forces driven to a tragic conclusion.  I am not familiar with Japanese literature, but 'X' reminds me of a Greek tragedy where anyone could stop the inevitable end, but no one does.  Kamui's tragic flaw is his inability to act until it is too late.  Fuuma, supposedly the villain of the piece, seems to be the nobler of the two, simply because he throws himself into his role.  All of the characters are disjointed archetypes, but despite all of the symbols and portents, nothing really gels.So this becomes an apocalypse in search of a cause.  Harumitsu Shimuzu as put together an excellent score, which seems to capture Kamui's perpetual agonizing and the film's ambivalent perfectly.  The film's theme, 'Forever Love' by Yoshiki, is worth keeping as well.  But good music and interesting artwork are not enough to overcome a skeletal plot that never moves in any direction for long.  A glance at the final credits reveals that this was a production with a cast of hundreds, and perhaps that is the problem.  Tragedy is best when it is not designed by committee.",X - The Movie VHS

255013,"This movie should have been billed as a spoof. After two, three, and four, it is obvious that the cast wanted to have fun with the story, and it is equally(and painfully)obvious that they really did not have a script. Kirk, McCoy and Spock are camping in Yosemite, when they are called back to go rescue the peace delegates on &quot;The planet of galactic peace&quot;. The delegates have been kidnapped by a renegade Vulcan named Sybok, who happens to be Spocks(half?)brother. That was a little too pat. Sybok's quest is to find God, who according to legend lives an the other side of the barrier at the center of the Galaxy. They rescue the delegates, only to have the delegates turn on them and turn him over to Sybok, who then turns his empathy powers onto the crew of the 1701-A, and who help imprison the Captain(Admiral!)and the Captain Spock. Except that they are rescued by the Captain Scott, despite his being exposed to the empathy powers of Sybok. Scottie then runs into a wall after saying he knows the ship like the back of his hand. The two captains are soon captured by Sybok's converts, but since they are now at or beyond the barrier, Sybok turns command back over to Kirk without even making him say pretty please. They find God, except he is not God but just some super energy being who was imprisoned in the ancient galaxy by forces/powers that we never find out about for reasons that are never stated. This scene produced the highlight of the movie, when Kirk asked &quot;Excuse me. Why does God need a starship?&quot;. A semi-renegade Klingon captain and crew were thrown in to spice it up, but ultimately they only give the movie two good lines for Spock: &quot;Damn you sir, you will try.&quot; and &quot;Please sir, not in front of the Klingons.&quot; The good-guys win, the bad guys lose, the betrayed idealist becomes the hero-martyr, and all is well again. Then we are back in Yosemite, but this time Spock knows &quot;Row, Row, Row your boat.&quot;It was obvious that the cast had fun doing this movie, but if I were the one titling it, it would be Star Trek Five: The Wrath of the Screen-Writers Guild.",N/A

595098,"Just came back for seeing M. Night Shyamalan's 'Signs' and I have to say that I enjoyed it very much.  The film features some really thrilling moments and will have the audience on the edge of their seats.  The cinematography is stunning and adds so much to the creepy atmosphere.  M.Night is one of my favorite new directors, and he did not disappoint me with this highly orginal take on the 'War Of The Worlds' theme.  And as much as the movie is about aliens and crop circles, there is also an underlying theme that deals with a man's search to regain his faith in God and to find the answer as to why sometimes bad things happen to the people we love.The movie begins with a series of geometric crop circles appearing mysteriously on the farm of Graham Hess(Mel Gibson), a former priest who lost his faith after his wife was accidently killed by a truck.  At first he thinks it is a hoax perpetrated by some local hooligans, but when he watches the news and finds that these crop circles are appearing in all parts of the world, he begins to realize that something more ominous could be happening.  The animals in the area begin to act strangely, and Graham's own dogs act violently, as if they were barking at something that wasn't there.  As the tension mounts, more reports on the television about crop circles, and then some strange lights that are seen hovering in the sky over Mexico.  People begin to predict the end of the world.  Graham tries to protect his family as the reports become even more terrifying.  This all leads to a very scary finale.Although the movie is filled with tension and suspense, there are also some great moments of comic relief, and they are interspersed nicely throughout the film.  Very good performances by Mel Gibson and Joaquin Phoenix(Merill Hess, Graham's brother), but they are upstaged by the two kids, Rory Culkin and Abigail Breslin.  Where does M. Night keep coming up with these great child actors from?  One minor problem I had with the film is a little too much reliance on sentimentality--in my opinion it could of done without so much of it and still been effective.  Also, in fairness I should say that I've already talked to someone who didn't like 'Signs' as much as I did, and I've read some of the bad reviews it has received, so my advice would be to see it for yourself, especially if you liked 'Unbreakable' and 'The Sixth Sense'; if it is anything, it is certainly entertaining.  I am already highly anticipating M. Night's next effort.",Signs
471186,"Since catching an edited version of ONE NIGHT IN EDEN on PBS, I have become an ardent Sarah Brightman fan. During that first experience, my world stopped; I was in suspended animation, so enthralled I was by this gorgeous and talented creature. After learning more about her -- that she is in fact a world renowned crossover theatrical performer -- I felt like the last to know. But, as they say, better late than never, and I cannot convey the emotion Sarah elicits with her stellar vocals and ethereal presence. Since that first accidental viewing, I've been under her spell; I have become a slave to that voice, that face, those beguiling facial expressions. It's no wonder she is referred to as ""The Angel of Music"": everything about her performance conjures the image of some diaphanous being whose spiritual energies are all but spent maintaining a bridge between heaven and earth.Sarah has so much talent to spare, she makes singing appear easy, almost as if she were conversing with us. She emotes sincerity, a love for the song, and a love for performing it for us. During the opening piece, ""Eden,"" she rises from a red-draped divan -- an allusion to the album from which the newest songs for this show are selected -- dressed in a silk, black gown accessorized with a filigreed breastplate fashioned after the attire of Nordic goddesses, a nod to her theatrical roots and denoting her pop-opera fusion. She then allures us with her supple, ornamented, genteel hands as she details the shortcomings in a previous friendship. The song conveys a longing to make the friendship whole, to finish what was left unrealized. In the context of this show, the audience is now the friend, and she seduces us into putting aside our misgivings with the promise that she will attain completeness with us. She more than meets her obligation. For the rest of the program, you'll be spellbound.To further justify my admiration for this woman, I want to note the nuanced performance of the Queen classic, ""Who Wants to Live Forever."" At the beginning of the song, she looms on a dias silhouetted against a dusk-blue backdrop of roiling sky, arms out, the light coming up to reveal her hair windblown back from her face. Forward movement is implied, and I was reminded of the figurehead on the prow of a galleon, resolutely looking out over a harsh seascape. She sings of a mournful resignation to mortality, but her posture is one of defiance, her chin tilted to take the blow of the elements: ""There's no time for us/ there's no place for us/ What is this thing that builds our dreams/ yet slips away from us?"" This contrast between determination and resignation extracts even greater irony from the lyrics, and while Queen's version is good in its own right, this cover by Sarah enriches it; she makes the song her own.Sarah demonstrates her own writing ability in ""So Many Things."" Some might recognize this song as the traditional melody ""The Women of Ireland"" (you can hear the Chieftans perform it on the BARRY LYNDON soundtrack), to which Sarah has added some folk-flavored lyrics befitting world music. Her words and vocals are a fine addition to this song, maintaining the Celtic tradition while broadening its appeal. She clearly has a dead-on instinct for picking songs that facilitate her unique stamp; she understands the songs, and uses her voice as an alembic to extract the rarest of emotions, further delineating the heart of the piece.Her performance is complemented throughout with a theatrical visual style, as you'd expect from someone with roots in musical theater. In ""Captain Nemo,"" a sheer curtain suggests an underwater world, from behind which Sarah emerges wearing a lavender dress, marking a sudden shift from a red-and-black color scheme (like the EDEN album cover) to a less-somber pastel theme. As the song changes to ""La Mer,"" she steps back behind the curtain, where she and two dancers take to the air via cables to create the illusion of swimming underwater. She also performs a few of the songs she made famous as Christine in PHANTOM OF THE OPERA, demonstrating her range and power, as she does at other times in the concert, such as in the more classically flavored pieces ""Nella Fantasia,"" ""Anytime, Anywhere,"" and ""Nessun Dorma."" She also reaches up and out in ""Only an Ocean Away"" -- a piece with an electric pulse to it, very strong and modern -- going from sweet songstress in one verse to soaring diva in the next.Her vocals are often processed to accentuate lushness. The live presentations differ from the studio versions of her songs in varying degrees, most of the time noticably, sometimes just enough to enjoy them as new performances. But the real pleasure comes from watching Sarah herself. She's charming and beautiful, with the most captivating blue-gray eyes, and hair as thick as wild jungle vines. Hell, she has so much poise, I'd pay to watch this woman do her nails.There are no extra features per se on this DVD. That is, there are no extras you access through a menu, as you can inLa Luna (Live in Concert). But like the VHS edition of this concert, the presentation begins with Sarah describing her affection for Africa, with samples of the landscape and icons to which she is referring spliced in. After the concert concludes, there is another more extensive interview about the show itself. She's an insightful interviewee and you come to appreciate the exactitude she attends to her art. Other than these interviews, the DVD edition is a no-frills product, basically a simple transfer from the VHS edition. The significant difference is that the sound and picture quality are vastly improved, and I can attest to this with certainty since I had watched the tape many, many times before I upgraded to the DVD. The improvement over the VHS edition is strikingly obvious, especially in the sharpness of the picture.I recommend this concert to anyone who enjoys live performances. This is a premium show, not to be missed.",N/A

Once everyone is in they go until a member of one of the teams submits.***1/2 Check out the first Wargames at Bash '87 instead.NWA Title - Ric Flair vs. Terry Funk - Funk was a judge for Flair vs. Steamboat at Wrestlewar (Greatest Match Ever!).  After about 40 minutes of action Ric Flair pinned Steamboat to regain the title.  Funk (who had been retired) took the opportunity to congratulate and challenge Flair for the title.  Flair pointed out that there is a ranking system and Funk would just have to climb the ladder until he was #1.  Funk was enraged and gave Ric a piledriver on a table (not the weak Dudley kind either!).  Flair's neck was broken and he gave Funk a title shot in order to get his hands on him.  Great angle and a great match.  1988-89 really showed what Flair could do - classic wrestling with Steamboat, making the careers of Sting/Luger, and two all out brawls with Terry Funk. ****1/2 Find Clash of the Champions for their ""I Quit"" match.

While I was not born in England and do not understand any of the slang, it did not stop me from enjoying this film.  I thought that the use of Beethoven's 9th Symphony was a very amusing touch, as it did not quite fit in with a lot of the visuals that were expressed;  I was further amused to see this brilliant piece of music used to torture Alex, as one of his victims frightenly recognizes the identity of his attacker.

147382,"Probably Fred Williamson's most successful and best-known film in the 1970s. ""Black Caesar"" deserves much attention.  Though it is flawed at some points, it is better than most of average blaxploitation films...The film choronicles the rise and fall of Tommy Gibbs, played by Fred Williamson with star-making performance.  But what makes this film impressive is Director Larry Cohen's good ideas here and there.  This New Yorker director uses good locations in New York City to give the film an authentic feeling, and Tommy's assasination scene and car chase sense (not by a fact-moving car, but by a stop-and-going taxi with mobsters behind it) in Manhattan is terrific.  And very ironical ending of the film (shot among the debris of buildings, or old dream) expresses effectively much bitter taste of Tommy's short-lived fame and power.Larry Cohen, whose career includes films which have many cult followers (""Maniac Cop"" ""Q"" ""It's Alive,"" and many more), is also known as a writer who produces good ideas, and ""Black Caesar"" surely shows his skills.  This film is probably better understood as a homage to gangster films of the 1930s (like ""Scarface"" starring Paul Muni) and ""Black Caesar,"" of which title reminds us of ""Little Caesar"" featuring Edward G Robinson, follows the pattern of the genre.  But the film definitely belongs to blaxploitation with its characteristic energy -- particularly by the intense acting of the cast and good soundtrack by James Brown -- and if you like ""Coffy"" ""Shaft"" ""Slaughter"" or that kind of film, you like it.Some ideas, by the today's standard, are questionable -- see how Tommy beats his enemy as a revenge for old days, using a shoe-shine box, and smears his face with black shoe polish -- but overall the film is an exciting blaxploitation film with a nod to gangster movies.",N/A

I find I often use the breathing technique now, not only to get through more challenging poses but during my busy day also. The meditation tapes are wonderful.

As far as Alicia Silverstone movies, this is, by far, the best. I fell in love with Alicia Silverstone. She is the best actress ever. I can recite the whole movei practically by heart. I bug the hell out of people with my recitations of scenes. This is hilarious! You won't stop laughing the whole time. AS's portrayal of Cher is perfect. Her faces are so cute and she is so hot in anything she wears, or, doesn't wear. The soundtrack is awesome too. I recommend that. This movie is so good! I can't say it enough times! Sure, there isn't much extra on the DVD, but the movie rocks. It's the best movie ever. EVER! It's a great movie for everyone, all ages. Men and women alike will love this movie when they see it. It's hilarious. Can I say it enough? You so have to get this movie. You'll start catching yourself doing all these Cher-isms. I do all the time. YOU MUST GET THIS MOVIE OR AT LEAST RENT IT! YOU WON'T REGRET IT. Until next time, Mariah Carey rules, and so does this movie! Enjoy!!!!!",Clueless VHS
696437,"Season 4 offers a lot; I'd buy the package for ""Brothers,"" ""Family,"" and ""The Drumhead"" alone. ""The Drumhead"" is a bottle show, but it doesn't play like one: it's a searing episode, and one that continues, or at least looks at seriously, the [groundless] investigation of Picard's character and command abilities. I must say, though, it's ahead of it's time - they should have saved it for the end of season 5 after such episodes as ""I, Borg"" and ""Silicon Avatar."" Then again, it sets up nicely the possibility that maybe even Picard has seriously dangerous lapses in judgment, as we see later in those two shows. Other gems of the season include ""Family,"" in which Picard returns to Earth after the Borg incident to try and patch up his relationship with his estranged brother while getting some time to sort things out. Picard's brother Robert is a bit gruff but welcoms his brother to their home in France; Jean-Luc, full of self doubt and distraught by his own lack of confidence as a result of his inability to resist assimilation, is tempted to leave Starfleet when he is invigorated by the promising youthfulness of Robert's son. Robert confronts his brother, encourages him to get back where he belongs, get back in the saddle, and they come to terms with their past differences and grudges in an old-fashioned fist fight in the mud behind the house. They laugh about their differences, now behind them, and Picard returns to his Enterprise emotionally healed. ""Brothers"" is also a gem, and continues the family theme from the aforementioned episode. In ""Brothers,"" Data is reunited with his father, Dr. Noonian Soong, in the wake of a bizarre accident onboard the Enterprise in which a child almost kills his brother. Data learns a lot about himself and his own little family: his father is brilliant and reclusive, alive when thought dead, he never knew his ""mother,"" and his brother (Lore) is opportunistic and maniacal. We're left with the thought that Data, in his own way, is very much human. After Lore shows up and goes on a violent rampage, Dr. Soong is left critically injured. Lore escapes before Data or the Enterprise crew can help, and the old man leaves his emotionless ""son"" with words that will give you shivers: in your own way, Data, you will grieve. The accident onboard the Enterprise that almost killed the child's brother is attended to, the child is saved, and we're left with Data watching them play.Season 4 is slightly unusual in that it hits the ground running and maintains its momentum throughout. Other goodies include: ""Final Mission,"" ""Legacy,"" and ""Future Imperfect."" ""Devil's Due"" is a romp, much like ""Qpid"" and ""The Nth Degree,"" where after encountering an alien probe Lt. Barclay's I.Q. is increased by hundreds of times. He connects himself to the computer, debates quantum physics and advanced math with Albert Einstein, and bests him. ""The Nth Degree"" features some cool visuals as well. ""Legacy"" is a good action episode and stirs up old memories for the crew when they visit the planet tasha Yar grew up on to recover a downed shuttle.There really aren't any shows that this season could do without; most seasons have at least one junk episode, but this one does not, along with season 7. All of the characters get their own showcase epsiode this season, and some get more than one. Data gets ""Brothers,"" ""Data's Day,"" and ""In Theory."" Picard gets ""Family,"" ""Final Mission"" along with Wes Crusher, and several other episodes. Troi is showcased in ""The Loss,"" and it's great to see her get to develop Troi from here on out; she's far above and beyond the cheerleader of seasons 1 and 2. Dr. Crusher and Wes get ""Remember Me,"" and Worf is showcased in ""Reunion"" and ""Redemption, Part I,"" two episodes that sort of ignite his ""family honor/Gowron"" theme that returns throughout the series. Riker's character gets to shine in ""First Contact"" and ""Future Imperfect.""I highly recommend season 4 and it's lineup of intriguing, emotionally charged stories. Character development is finally and thankfully made the driving force of the year. While season 3 was a colossal leap forward, year 4 was the pay off of the first 4 seasons.",N/A

676639,"First off, I was ... misled ...  The previews in no way suggested that this movie would be a musical.  Although visually pleasing, the bits and pieces of pop music scattered throughout the movie was somewhat disconcerting.  I just couldn't get used to it.  It might have been a bit better if I would have known whether most of the movie was meant to be joking or serious.  I swear, every time they burst into a remade pop song, I was waiting for a punch line only to be confused when there wasn't any.  I am assuming the ""Like a Virgin"" scene was a joke, and, although I now find it hilarious, the first time I saw the movie I was so confused as to whether the director was joking and trying to make the audience laugh, or if he was in earnest ...  I would have just given this movie two stars, but for one reason.  The remake or ""Roxanne"" was so poinient and so well done I would buy the movie just for that.",N/A

The box structure and layout remains the same, the foldout holding the DVDs is the same material as the rest. Overall the physical layout of the box set is the same as before.My only complaint with the entire box set is the layout on each disk. This time, instead of having short clips of all the episodes on the disk play back to back, or having a separate screen for each episode, the disk is split in half, with two screens for clips, each one alternating between two episodes. It makes it harder to follow than previous disks, unless you're familiar with all the episodes on that disk you're not sure where each episode ends and the next begins.",N/A

If you saw them before then or after it, his voice sounds SO much better.

675926,"I can see how this film would be popular with a certain audience.  Hedwig is one of those cutsey/artsy films that is clearly in origin intelligent enough to be really great but seems so caught up in its gimick rather than getting down to telling a story that in the end I couldn't consider this film anything more than a failure.True, there are plenty of films that don't have half the talent that Hedwig does, but its just that promise with a failure to deliver that's so frustrating.  So, let's itemize this nonesense:1.  If you don't love the music, forget it.  The obvious nods to Bowie are certainly enjoyable, but the music literally pads out over half the movie.  In a true musical, we actually have the narrative of the story explained and strengthened through the songs.  At times it feels like Hedwig was doing this but most of the time it seems like they were having more fun doing fake music performances.  Why not just watch Spinal Tap instead?  Because the songs take up the majority of the film and bring the tiny amount of narrrative flow in the movie to a near standstill, unless you're absolutely enthralled with the music in Hedwig, the film can't help but dissapoint.2. What I was waiting to develop during all those songs was a great story that just didn't happen.  I was actually interested in main character and many of the unexplained side characters.  The fact that hedwig was a TRUE freak among a profession of poesers was absolutely fascinating.  Did the movie bother to explore any of this?  Absolutely not.3. What we get instead of an actual resolution to the nonexisting story is a rather inept attempt at a freak-out ending, complete with sets that were formerly all black changing to all white, Hedwig rips off his/her close, walking around near naked and looking identical to his love/hate boyfriend Tommy.  There's supposed to be something deep with how men and women used to be one being and were split, but it feels as though it was carried off so incompetantly or simply incompletely that whatever message the director was intending feels utterly lost--meaning that really the last 20 minutes are essentially a waste.I'm left wondering why this film has received such a high rating and so many positive reviews.  Where other films have explored similiar grounds with much greater effectiveness, Hedwig seems only capable of raising them, singing about them, but then gives up.  Or perhaps it was just one big music video?  Hedwig certainly isn't the worst film I've seen by any measure, rather, it isn't a movie.  Just a pretentious artsy pile posing as one.",Hedwig and the Angry Inch
592104,"To begin with, this movie is very emotionally charged and poignant and sends a distinct message concerning the rapid decline of our health care system.  It is a story of one individual driven to take extreme measures when all other courses of action have failed.Denzel Washington stars as John Q. Archibald who is a hard working family man trying his very best to keep his finances solvent and trying to make a better life for his family.  It is discovered early on, while at his son's baseball game, that his son collapses and is diagnosed with a life threatening heart condition.  The prognosis for his son is that he needs a heart transplant in a very short time.  John Q discovers that his insurance policy does not cover the needed medical costs to have this operation take place and he is suddenly initiated into the unfair and cruel realities of our health system.Anne Heche, who plays the consummate hospital administrator, tells John Q his son needs to placed on a list for heart recipients and that a heart transplant comes with an enormous cost which he cannot possibly afford.  Almost devoid of sympathy and acting in a manner akin to a corporate CEO or policy maker or politician, the administrator's true interest here is the profit margin and having the correct type of insurance coverage or nothing at all.  John Q is basically told that there is nothing that can be done for him whatsoever.John Q pleads with the cardiologist (James Woods) to perform the operation and that he will raise the necessary funds and pay him any way that he can as soon as he can.  The doctor basically tells him that he is out of options also and that his dying son will be discharged from the hospital very soon.  John Q's distraught wife urges her husband to take some form of action immediately to save their son's life.  Being forced into a corner with nowhere to turn, John Q decides to take control of the hospital (along with hostages) until an agreement can be made to help his son.Ray Liotta and Robert Duvall star as police officers trying to diffuse the situation with each one of them having differing and conflicting ideas on how to terminate the hostage crisis.  As the movie proceeds, you are able to see the interactions that unfold between John Q, his hostages, his family, and the police.  It is a moving and emotional time leading ever closer to his son losing his battle to live.  By what might be attributed to a miracle, the hospital receives word that a properly matched heart has been located and is flown to the hospital to save the son of John Q.  A successful operation is perfomed which saves the life of his son, ends the hospital crisis, and subjects John Q to the legal system for the acts he has committed.The actions of John Q, although criminal, were not borne out of machismo or malice or spite, but instead were acted out because of serious desperation and the deep love for his son and his desire for his son to have an equal chance to live a long, healthy, and prosperous life.The main characters in this movie, Denzel Washington, James Woods, Robert Duvall, Ray Liotta, and Anne Heche, delivered excellent perfomances and made the movie very enjoyable.  The plot does, at times, seem a little sensational or maybe a little too manufactured but it does not really deter from the true meaning of the movies message.  This movie idealizes a loving father saving his son's life and having to fight an unjust health care system that should benefit all citizens but doesn't due to it's myriad problems and unfair practices.I highly recommend this movie to everyone and would venture to say that it is probably one of Denzel Washington's best performances to date.  Very enjoyable movie.",N/A

Mandy Moore's performance as the shy and reserved Jamie Sullivan was both inspiring and believable, her acting proved to be nothing more than perfect, she really made the character come alive. Shane West played the part of Landon Carter to perfection, in the beginning of the movie his character was like this tough, bad boy I don't give a sh** about anything and then he meets Mandy Moore's character and the way their friendship blossoms into love changes him in a way that he never thought possible and Shane does that transformation so well. Shane and Mandy's chemistry in this movie is electric and seeing them together in some of the scenes in this movie such as when she tells him that she is dying from cancer, or when he tells her that he loves her definitely touched my heart and brought tears to my eyes. This movie is about true love, faith, and that admist all of those goals we wish to accomplish in our lives the greatest one we can accomplish is finding true love.

382526,"Tales about sinister, creepy mansions were already cliched by the time director James Whale directed THE OLD DARK HOUSE--and instead of presenting the piece as a straight-forward thriller he mixed the film's very atmospheric cinematography with a wild strain of parody.  The result is a movie with a bizarre camp humor that foreshadows Whale's slightly later and even more bizarrely camp THE BRIDE OF FRANKESTEIN.  The plot, based loosely on a J.B. Priestly novel, is perfunctory, existingly only to throw together an ensemble cast of already-famous and soon-to-be-famous stars.  Five motorists are trapped in the wilds of Wales during a horrific storm and are forced to seek shelter at, of course, an old dark house... but their unwilling hosts are a neurotic Ernest Thesiger, his religious fanatic sister Eva Moore, and their hulking, deformed, and mute butler Boris Karloff.  Before the night is over the storm-weary travelers experience everything from a hellish meal to religious lectures--not to mention assault, attempted rape, mysterious cackling, a bit of arson, and a touch of homosexual hysteria (courtesy of Thesiger, Moore, and a surprise male character who is actually played by a woman) thrown in for good measure.The cast is exceptional; in addition to Karloff, Thesiger, and Moore, we have Melvyn Douglas, Raymond Massey, Charles Laughton, Gloria Stuart, and Lilian Bond, and they wring the most from the covertly wicked script, with Eva Moore ranting about ""laughter and sin,"" Thesiger inviting Raymond Massey into his room ""to see a few things,"" and one of the most socially awkward meals ever put to film.  But the film's real power is its cinematography: when they say old DARK house, they really mean it, and the look of the film is just as disorienting for viewers as for the characters; particularly noteworthy is the scene in which Moore lectures Gloria Stuart, with their faces distorted by the bedroom mirror, and the sequence in which Karloff pursues the white-clad and wind-whipped Gloria Stuart with mayhem in mind. Viewers who expect ""Universial Horror"" fare will probably be disappointed by THE OLD DARK HOUSE, and director James Whale would create a still more memorable combination of horror and high-camp with THE BRIDE OF FRANKENSTIEN.  But THE OLD DARK HOUSE is an overlooked jewel of unusual quality: a sardonic parody of a famous theme, well played, filmed and scripted.  Recommended.",Old Dark House VHS
364043,"Richard Donner's madcap kids adventure was a big hit in it's own little way back in the 80s, and it's not hard to see why. It's filled with memorable lines and wacky humour that appealed to kids back then. But is it actually that good? Well, some of it is a bit grinding sometimes, where the film starts to verge on ""screaming"" humour, which we all know, ain't funny at all. But the bunch of weirdos who go off in search of 'One-eyed Willie's treasure proves for some good-natured fun and innocent adventure.The standout performance in the film is Jonathan Ke Quan (INDIANA JONES AND THE TEMPLE OF DOOM), where we find out, that HEY, Some kids CAN act! It's fun to spot all the young kiddies who went on to bigger things like Josh Brolin and Sean Astin. And of course, Jeff Cohen as the wimpy 'Chunk' who keeps coming across corpses, providing some halarious moments. The fact that Donner helmed this small-scale adventure seems strange, given that he went on to do things like THE OMEN and the LETHAL WEAPON films, but it's handled well, and dosn't get TOO far-fetched. You have to have bad guys of course, and this one has Robert Davi (From A VIEW TO A KILL) and THE MATRIX's Joe Pantoliano as the bumbling Fratelli brothers chasing after the ""Goonies"".

543624,"Writer/director Kevin Smith's characters Jay and Silent Bob made their first appearance in 1994's cult favorite, ""Clerks"". They stood outside a convenience store. Ostensibly, they were selling pot, but, for the most part, they just hung out waiting for something to happen. They appeared in all of Smith movies over the next five years [""Mallrats"", Chasing Amy"" and ""Dogma""]. Now comes ""Jay and Silent Bob Strike Back"", in which the pair must carry an entire movie, rather than playing minor roles. Because they are basically one big joke, the results are uneven. The scenes that work are some the funniest moments in recent movies. The rest, which are in the minority, are pretty painful. Whatever the scene, be forewarned that these guys remain consistently perverse and offensive.This is a road movie, and the plot is just an outline to which the various skits are attached. The movie starts off outside the very same convenience store where Jay and Silent Bob [Jason Mewes and Kevin Smith] were first seen in ""Clerks"".They learn that a movie studio is about to make a film based on ""Bluntman and Chronic"", a comic book. Jay and Bob were the inspiration for the comic, and they are furious that they are getting neither cash nor credit from the project. They decided to go to Hollywood to stop the movie production and to get revenge. Along the way, they become the unwitting pawns of a beautiful girl gang of jewel thieves. They're easy targets since both Jay and Silent Bob are complete morons.Whether or not you find the movie funny depends on a couple of things. One is an appreciation of Hollywood in-jokes.  Rarely has a movie been so full of them. The title itself is a reference to ""The Empire Strikes Back"". The original Princess Leia and Luke Skywalker, Carrie Fisher and Mark Hamil, have cameo appearances. So do lots of other actors, like Matt Damon and Ben Affleck. Smith executive produced the movie that made them famous, ""Good Will Hunting"". The girl gang is a parody of ""Charlie's Angels"". The movie references are so numerous that there are references to references. For some viewers, all this insider stuff will become exasperating. Others will love it, as they try to recognize as many as possible. I found it all to be fun yet completely self-indulgent, since, ultimately, it's all about how hip and knowledgeable Smith and his buddies are.The other thing required to enjoy this movie is a fondness for crude humor, or, perhaps in this case, a love of it. There is enough bathroom humor and profanity in the first twenty minutes to last some people a lifetime. I read that a certain four-letter word is used here 228 times, a figure I've no reason to doubt. Graphic sexual references abound, due mainly to Jay's complete obsession with the subject. Since many people are already familiar with Smith's characters, they won't be seeing or hearing anything unexpected. It's other people who need to be warned. This movie goes way beyond merely risqu&eacute;.It is only fair to point out that several groups have protested Jay's totally homophobia behavior. I doubt these attempts to censure Smith are necessary. He's a satirist. No group, be it women, blacks, Catholics, teenagers, old people or gays, escape his twisted humor. Even the stars playing themselves, such as Damon and Affleck, come off as ditzy fools. Smith himself laughs the criticism off, noting that everyone knows Jay and Silent Bob are idiots. At least we hope they do. On the other hand, aren't there always a few idiots in an audience?",Jay and Silent: Bob Strike Back
262564,"Cynics would hardly expect much from a movie featuring such fan mag confections as Sandra Dee and Troy Donahue, whose blonde coiffures graced many a Photoplay cover of the day. (Then, there is the friend who cautioned never to trust a film in which the boy is prettier than the girl.) That being said, the film holds up surprisingly well as a super slick piece of 50's soap opera, in which the usually vapid Donahue and the baby-faced Dee remain rather affecting as lovers despite the handicaps. Thankfully, Donahue is called upon to do little more than look earnestly concerned, while Dee pouts and emotes in wide-eyed, photogenic fashion that brought out many an audience handkerchief. Credit should go to producer-writer-director Delmer Daves for almost transcending the material with an earnest plea to humanize love and sex away from the dead hand of our Puritan forebearers. In the uptight 50's, that was no small risk and could even be construed as a commitment to free love and communism. As writer, Daves may not have thought in subversive terms, but his plea was enthusiastically received by teens of the day, who flocked to the film in droves. As producer, Daves had the good sense to bolster his youthful celebrities with a first-rate supporting cast, including the always commanding Constance Ford as the Puritan witch, along with the ever versatile Arthur Kennedy, at his sardonic and smirking best. Also holding up over time--photographer Harry Stradling's glossy transformation of coastal life into a series of blissfully romanticized frames that contribute greatly to the movie's travel brochure atmosphere. Unfortunately, Daves remains an under-rated filmmaker from that era, while A Summer Place proves he could handle the treacly fare just as effectively as the more cowboy kind he was used to. Also of passing interest--anyone wondering how teen culture moved out of the 50's to become that of the free-wheeling 60's should catch this movie for its few hesitant steps, suggesting, I suppose, that it's the Delmer Daves of the world that effect real change, rather than the more lauded and esoteric art house crowd.",N/A
363057,"This is the kind of dark, bleak comedy that the British excelled at in the 1950s, and seems to anticipate many of the comic trends found on both sides of the Atlantic in the decades that were to follow.  The plot concerns the adventures of a group of thieves who meet in the apartment of Alec Guinness, the gang's mastermind and the tenant of the lady of the title.  Although the movie has many wonderful moments, I think my favorites are those in which a wildly grinning Guinness explains to his landlady the various goings on in his flat.The cast is absolutely first rate.  Even by Guinness's chameleonic standards, this is one of his more unusual performances.  He made himself up to bear a striking resemblance to the great Alastair Sim, wearing some padding to make his frame look more like Sim's, and wearing false teeth and combing his hair to more successfully mimic Sim.  It is a quite successful imitation, but I would enjoy knowing a bit more about why Guinness made this decision.  Anyone familiar with the Pink Panther films will be delighted to see Peter Sellers and Herbert Lom as members of Guinness's gang.  Lom was one of the great heavies in 1950s British film, and his casting in a comedy film was at the time highly unusual.  Sellers, of course, was a few years from the film that would first bring him fame, I'm ALRIGHT, JACK, and his role in this film is not a major one.  This is very definitely the &quot;early&quot; Peter Seller, carrying a great deal more weight before he lost a great deal because of the illnesses that plagued him throughout most of his life (Sellers suffered from a very serious heart condition the eventually killed him).This film isn't for everyone.  It isn't a film that will illicit laughs so much as smiles.  And many will find the entire tone to be very, very dark, perhaps too dark for their liking.  Finally, many will not enjoy a comedy in which all the major characters are essentially unlikable cads.  But for those of us for whom these are not barriers, this is one of the most unique and enjoyable comedies of the 1950s.",The Ladykillers VHS

There is no discussion of proper body alignment (though Tracey Rich certainly demonstrates admirable positioning herself), the only modifications provided are for people who are more advanced (which is not the likely to be the largest audience for this or any other yoga tape), and the pace is basically breakneck.  Most teachers will tell you that yoga is to be done with the breath, and doing the ujjayi breathing that is taught at the beginning of this tape tends to slow and deepen the breath... However, Ms. Rich whips through the movements at a frenetic pace that has never left me time to do the asanas with proper care.  I find that I have to do this tape with the remote at hand to stop the program frequently so that I can do the movements at a pace appropriate for me.If you want an aerobic routine, this might be the ticket due to the speed of the instruction.  If you are brand-new to yoga, this tape may be quite frustrating due to the pace and lack of true beginner-level guidance.  If you have done yoga for awhile and have a good grasp of proper alignment, this program can provide a moderate challenge (again, mostly due to the speed, rather than the difficulty of the asanas).While this is a great tape, I just don't think it is a good choice for *most* beginners.  Although many reviewers seem to find the Yoga Journal tapes &quot;too slow,&quot; they are a much better intro and provide more guidance for proper alignment, modifications, etc.Incidentally, I agree with other reviewers' comments about the clean, plain set.  I don't mind the exotic locales in most tapes, but they don't exactly provide the viewer any real benefit.  Tracey Rich's ramrod-straight bearing and slightly cranky expression seem very businesslike, in contrast with the often woozy/dreamy vibe put out by most video yogis.  And it's not a negative, just a comment, but Ms. Rich is wearing more makeup in this video than I've ever seen in any other yoga video or in a live class!Overall, a good tape for people with a well-integrated sense of proper alignment and at least some yoga experience.",Total Yoga VHS

The movie itself is wonderful and includes the voice talents of Billy Crystal, John Goodman, Steve Buscemi, John Ratzenberger, Jennifer Tilly, and James Coburn. As you probably already know the storyline, I'll just talk about DVD.You get 2 discs- one contains the movie itself (with the ""full screen"" or ""widescreen"" versions, as well as a director's commentary option)and the second disc is chock full of goodies! You get ""For the Birds"" the 2001 Academy Award winner for Best Animated Short Film (shown in theaters before the movie), and ""Mike's New Car"" (exclusively created for the video and DVD release, as well as an exclusive sneak peek of ""Finding Nemo"", the newest upcoming release from Disney starring Ellen DeGeneres, Albert Brooks, and Willem Dafoe. Plus, if you choose the ""Human Door"" option, you get a tour of the Pixar animation studios by the makers of the film. They'll show you deleted scenes, 3-D location flyarounds, and animation gags and ""inside"" jokes. The ""Monster World"" door is where the real fun starts- train for your first day at Monster's Inc.; see the employee handbook, and play the ""Boo's Door Game"", which works like a CD rom-type game. Use your remote control to go through doors and find pieces of Boo's door that come together like a puzzle. The kids and I had tons of fun playing this together.

I have not had the desire to sit through the 'longer' version just yet but it will be interesting to see what elements of the movie were removed prior to it's original release.

If the subject matter is tough for you to get into, then check it out just for Emma Thompson's performance. Amazing. Emma stars as Vivian Bearing, an English teacher who is diagnosed with cancer. The film then follows her through her life and her ordeal with the deadly disease. It's all her. The whole film focuses on her and her point of view, and doesn't go for the medical view of it. It's about human compassion. It's about facing one's mortality. The movie is so shockingly real, with no cotton candy covering at all. Emma Thompson's performance is nothing short of astonishing. You feel for her. You pray for her. You feel as if you know her. I certainly did. This film brought back some very personal memories of my own. My aunt died from cancer a number of years ago. She moved in with us and we took care of her. I watched as she faded away. Rather quickly at that as well. The images and different stages of it that I saw were really tough on an 11 year old. Images I will never forget as long as I live. She was misdiagnosed at the beginning, and when it was corrected, it was too late. She would still be here with us today if it had been diagnosed correctly. This film was a definite hearttugger for me. Have some hankies handy. Director Mike Nichols is a genius. Both him and Emma deserve Emmy's. Wit is a groundbreaking film. The best Made For Cable film in ages.",Wit

587291,"David Lynch's &quot;Mulholland Drive&quot; is one of the best movies I've seen in many years, even though I'm still trying to figure out what actually happened in this 2.5 hour movie.  Unlike most films that operate on logic, &quot;Mulholland Drive&quot; works on the emotions.  If you want a mystery that &quot;ties everything together,&quot; then this isn't the movie for you.The plot involves a brunette who, having just survived a car accident, staggers through the streets of LA, apparently not remembering her name or the accident.  She stumbles her way into a posh home, where she befriends a perky blonde, who just flown from Canada to launch an acting career.  Together, they try to discover the brunette's identity.Meanwhile, a young hotshot director is being manipulated by members of the mob, who insist they have a say as to who should be cast as leading lady in his film.  This subplot, I guess, is Lynch's commentary on Hollywood and the often dubious politics that go on during movie-making.Despie the movie's incoherence, &quot;Mulholland Drive&quot; is absolutely fascinating to watch.  Everything, from the camerawork to Angelo Badalamenti's seductive score to Naomi Watts's award-calibre performance, grabs hold of your attention and refuses to let go.  But just when you THINK you've understood the movie, the film's final third takes a dramatic, unexpected turn.  I won't reveal what it is, but it will certainly throw you in for a loop.The DVD itself has a great 5.1 soundtrack and a crisp and vivid picture.  However, all we get for features are the trailer and &quot;10 clues.&quot;  What's really frustrating, though, is that the film has only ONE chapter: the movie itself!  That's right, you can't go from scene to scene in this film without hitting your fast-forward button.

The back stabbing in question ceasing to be a metaphor at one point. Just thought I'd mention it, though. No dancing around the Dahlias then, just corpses.Allegedly funny, this modest genre outing proves nothing less than the pornography of violence, the sadism of which precludes any real fun. Did I say fun? There must be a reason why it has engendered so many repeat viewings and that can only be due to the performance of Jeff Combs, although the rest of the cast is strong. Combs manages to introduce elements of a walking cartoon into his performance without losing focus and realism. It's quite a turn. Having found his niche, Mr Combs has continued to work mostly outside the mainstream of movie production where he has no doubt progressed from playing the unhinged Mr West to characters without any window frame at all. I have only seen three of his oeuvre, so I cannot testify to the accuracy of this statement but should the situation change I expect uncanny prescience to be the order of the day.Nice touch when a character actually collapses from shock, an affliction that curiously escaped the beleagered Ash in 'The Evil Dead' in which he suffered considerably worse without the employ (however Dionysian) of a side kick.",N/A

346538,"What would you do, as a fulfillment of office, if you were given the chance to stand-in for the President of the United States? ""Dave"" answers this question in a light political comedy that is sure to please anyone. The film may not be as intelligent a material as ""The American President,"" but it is still a winner in its own right, and much more.A stroke while on adulterous sex has the incumbent President incapacitated by stroke, and look-alike Dave is secretly planted into the position by the scheming Chief of Staff to prevent the ""Boy Scout"" VP from taking it otherwise (the movie leaves us to deduce much of the Chief's hidden agenda. It is quite bloody when you think about it.) Other than a breach in democracy and the breaking of a multitude of laws, what follows is the heartwarming story of a White House adventure that is very satirical, endearing, funny, melancholic and ultimately romantic.Originally, I thought of giving this film four stars, but changed my mind since having noticed that it got better and better with each viewing. Having seen this film more than once, I also found out that what makes ""Dave"" work is not only its ability to warm the heart, but to make it soar as well. We find a connection with Dave (Kevin Kline) that makes us want to give him a big hug for the things he did in the White House. What is mostly curious is the movie's ability to arouse the pride of the nation, all the while saying (and portraying) that ""the country has a lot of problems that we don't want to face them anymore.""The wonderful storyline is seasoned with:1.) lots of excellent performances (to name one, watch Frank Langella silently boil over as he helplessly watches Dave do cuts with the budget,)2.) lots of cameos by real-life politicians, and personalities from TV, film and media, lending credibility to an otherwise incredible story.3.) lots of comic moments,4.) some one-line punchers such as Sigourney Weaver's ""Go to hell..."" (for a 1993 movie, this remark seems to hail a future event,) Charles Grodin's ""Get out of here as fast as you can!"", and the sudden and uncalled for remark of the real president, "" &iexcl;Kjust get rid of that grin, you look like a schmuck.""5.) and at least a seemingly irrelevant (and short) but ultimately funny scene where the dialogue veered into the topic of thick necks and sweaters.This movie is bound to raise different kinds of questions. It makes us ask why things are always otherwise than that of the movie. Could be that this is bred from our want of political heroes, something which our modern world lacks and lacks and lacks. My answer, ""Let the film inspire you."" However on the other side, one will find implausible such a scenario as the film's premise. My answer, ""Who cares??""",N/A

689973,"This is a brilliant and highly original animated film, directed by Richard Linklater. It is definitely not a children's movie, not because it contains ""adult"" themes, but because it is very verbal and intellectual. It is actually a series of discussions on philosophical topics. The unifying theme is dreaming. The protaganist is a young man who cannot seem to wake from his dream. As he encounters many eccentrics, who expound on existentialism, evolution and rebellion (real life conspiracy theorist Alex Jones is the voice of a rabble rouser), he gradually realizes he is having a long lucid dream (a lucid dream being a dream where you know you are dreaming). Can he ever wake up? Are dreams and waking really separate worlds? The highly creative and original animation provides a superb visual counterpart to the film's intellectualism, which would be a little dry if it was just people talking to each other. In this manner the film satisfies both sides of the brain. The voices are entertaining and diverse; among them are Ethan Hawke and Julie Delpy, who starred in Before Sunrise, another Linklater film.

A large portion of Spy Game was spent largely on dialogue... not very good dialogue, mind you.  More captivating films tend to show these professional spies in action, i.e. jumping out of airplanes or making large buildings explode.  This may not be the case in real life, but it's what we paid to see.Robert Redford may have acted his character well, but was he interesting enough to glue his audience to the screen?

The characters are cardboard cutouts and the action is so plodding it stands still. This could be better described as a SDS propaganda film made twenty odd years after the fact. The use of 16mm film could have added power if there had just been something of a story to be told.Instead we are introduced to the caring Bos, but we are never given any clues to why he cares, who he is, or what he actually thinks about anything.

491100,"My favorite female performer in the history of film is Barbara Stanwyck. Unlike many actresses, she could excell in sympathetic roles, comedic roles, and sinister roles. We could love her or hate her. Unfortunately, this enormous versatility of hers kept her from making as many romantic or screwball comedies as I would have liked. As great as she could be in comedy (especially in her three great comedic pictures, BALL OF FIRE, her other, even better, holiday film REMEMBER THE NIGHT, and the incomparably brilliant THE LADY EVE, which provided her with one two or three greatest screen roles, and which also took place partly in Connecticut), she made comparably few.CHRISTMAS IN CONNECTICUT is a good film, and Stanwyck is Stanwyck, but despite many fine and enjoyable moments, it does not rank among her very best. The problem does not lie with her, but with her costar Dennis Morgan, who although quite handsome and possessed of a beautiful baritone, was more than a little stiff as an actor, and not terribly good at comedy. The supporting cast, however, is utterly first rate. The film provided S. K. ""Cuddles"" Sakall one of his finest roles, as Felix, the person who provides columnist Stanwyck her recipes. Reginald Gardiner is also excellent, as the would-be and more than a little dull suitor, less oily and dislikable than most of his other roles. Sydney Greenstreet is great in a role that we more normally associate with Charles Coburn in the forties.But a couple of things keep me from liking this film as much as I might have. First, there is the aforementioned Morgan. I find him just a little too dull. A good singer and serviceable in musicals, but not a comic talent.  I know Cary Grant and Joel McCrea weren't available for every film being made in the decade, but I do regret that someone with a little more charisma. Second, there is a problem with the script that makes the film seem too formulaic for me. Now, this is a formula picture, like most comedies, apart from the greatest classics (like THE LADY EVE or BRINGING UP BABY, which, by the way, used the same house as this one). The trick with the good formula pictures is that they don't allow the formula to drive the picture as key moments. This one does. For instance, when Barbara meets Dennis Morgan for the first time, she is almost instantly smitten with him. Why? Was it because things happened that indicated a magical chemistry? No, it was because the plot required that she fall in love with him right away. Contrast this with the long initial seduction scene where Barbara causes Henry Fonda to fall in love with her in THE LADY EVE, during which she unexpectedly falls in love with her prey. Now, later in the film, her talent takes several scenes over and she makes their attraction seem more plausible than the script itself does. But their first several minutes seem faked, more a need of the film's story than anything else.Still, another good Barbara Stanwyck movie. Not all of her movies are good, but I have never seen her in a film in which she wasn't superb. Anyone seeing this primarily because it is a holiday movie should definitely go out of their way to see the even better REMEMBER THE NIGHT, in which Barbara goes home with Fred MacMurray to Indiana for the holidays.",N/A
16320,"APT PUPIL(USA/France - 1997)Aspect ratio: 2.39:1 (Super 35)Theatrical soundtracks: SDDS-8 / Dolby Stereo SRBased on a Stephen King novella first published in the 'Different Seasons' anthology in 1982, Bryan Singer's masterful thriller - his immediate follow-up to the cult favorite THE USUAL SUSPECTS (1995) - is a virtual two-hander between venerable Brit actor Ian McKellen as a decrepit former Nazi living in seclusion in a small American town, and young Brad Renfro (THE CLIENT) as a budding sadist whose unhealthy interest in the Holocaust sends him directly to McKellen's door, having recognized him from old photographs which betray his prior identity. Forced to recount the details of his murderous past to the boy, who threatens to expose him otherwise, these two deeply unpleasant characters begin to awaken long-dormant mutual impulses, with inevitably tragic consequences...Superbly acted, especially by the two leads, and directed by Singer with exquisite grace from Brandon Boyce's tightly-constructed screenplay, the film explores the ways in which history affects the present, and how the seeds of genocide can blossom unexpectedly from within the most ordinary - seemingly benign - circumstances. When Renfro asks McKellen how it felt to kill people, he's actually testing his own capacity for unimaginable evil, and one suddenly understands how the Holocaust was possible, and how a similar atrocity could easily happen again, even in the most 'civilized' society. Despite first-class performances and production values, the movie wasn't a box-office success, partly because we're invited to sympathize with an unrepentant monster and his all-too-willing disciple. David Schwimmer, Elias Koteas, Bruce Davison and Joshua Jackson are featured in brief supporting roles.NB. Similar territory is explored in Agustin Villaronga's extraordinary thriller IN A GLASS CAGE (1986), a Spanish masterpiece in which a former Nazi doctor is visited at his isolated home by one of his victims, a young man whose experiences as a child in the concentration camps have unleashed all kinds of monsters from his broken mind.

And that is a good thing.Frida is an amazing collage of one of the most fascinating artists, sexual and political women of our time. Like many others her paintings, at first repulsed me, but after reading excerpts from Herrera's biography on Frida- ( which is bogged down on the love letters and love making, with hardly a comment on the political and national turmoil of the times),- one could see why the painting's were so full of sorrow and life defying pain.Frida lived in some very volatile times the revolution in Russia with Trotsky living in her house. Her husband and mentor and much admired muralist Diego Rivera going to New York, commissioned to paint a mural for Rockefeller and painting Lenin as one of the struggling workers. When asked to remove Lenin from the painting, he refused and Rockefeller tore the mural down.It was a time of great nationalism and the struggle to stop the European influence in Mexico.Many kudos' to Salma Hayek for her devotion to this biopic. I was very concerned that it could not be done, but it has been done and a great job. There's got to be some Oscar nominations out of this beautiful movie.

The two main characters, Salma and Molina fit as a pair of gloves and Tango around each other as honeybees around a bright red poppy.If you miss this movie you will have missed one of the best biopic's ever.ciao yaaah69I give it 4/5",Frida
579935,"Tati spent years working on this, the summa of all his comedic direction. PLAYTIME is a study of a day and night in an unrecognizable Paris, where modernist architecture have all but obliterated the city everyone remembers. Tati's point is that this is what urban life has done to Western civilization worldwide (indeed, in the film we frequently see travel posters advertising foreign cities where the same ugly concrete skyscraper appears, blocking out the views of more distinctive landmarks behind it.) But Tati's genius is that he doesn't linger on nostalgia: no matter what has been lost, Tati's characters must move forward and make do with what they've been given. This point is gorgeously made in the film when, fleetingly, the cupolas of Sacre Coeur and the spire of the Eiffel Tower are seen as reflections in glassed doorways. As we see these reflected images, the characters in the film look back at these pre-contemporary landmarks, softly sigh, and then move forward with the modernist Paris they have been given to work in and with.But the pleasure of PLAYTIME is that this modernist Paris may be ugly but it's all a kind of glass-and-cement playground for adults: everything in Tati's Paris is breaking down and is hopelessly confusing, but this is a source of tremendous fun for the viewer--and ultimately, for the film's participants. The story follows Tati's French Everyman, the endearingly clumsy Monsieur Hulot, as his path takes him in and out of a group of American tourists (their dialogue, written by Art Buchwald, becomes most memorable when they visit a technology fair: ""Ooh, and it's so pratical!"" one of them intones, as she watches a model demonstrate new eyeglasses with lift-up lenses for doing one's eyeshadow.) Although Hulot's confusion with modernity inevitably brings chaos in his wake, just about everyone adores him, and by the end of the film he's memorably charmed the prettiest of the tourists. Also by the film's brilliant ending the triumph of this sense of postmodern ""play"" is firmly in place: everytime I see this film I choke up at the end (and can't explain why) when the traffic circle becomes brilliantly transformed (by Tati's brilliant editing and choreography) into a kind of funfair. There's something very moving in seeing that, finally, that Tati reaffirms this landscape of modernity as a space for fun and play, rather than for alienation and disintegration.I was very lucky to have first seen this film in the Eighties on a widescreen, at the Brattle Theatre in Cambridge, Mass. It's just about impossible to see this film this way anymore, and it's a great shame: the widescreen ratio was employed to full use by Tati, and there's often something going on on both sides of the screen that the current DVD format can't pick up. But this is small potatoes: this film is a masterpiece, and deserves to be seen in any format.",Playtime

I expect to see some grain on the film and all in all, I personally am not that disappointed with the picture quality but it all could (and should) have been so much better.To start off with the packaging is a cardboard case that will fall to pieces long before the DVD does. There are no commentaries, no production notes, filmographies, cast/character bios, gallery, outtakes, etc etc. All we get is a static menu, the movie trailer and 20 minutes of interviews with the cast (that were recorded 4 years ago to celebrate the re-release of Grease for it's 20th anniversary in 1998).

868233,"Taliesin Jones, the triumphant first film from Tulsa-based Impact Entertainment to see a national release, differs from mainstream Hollywood films in three ways.  First, it&#65533;s character-driven, which means that the actors have to carry the film by showing character development and growth, instead of dodging bullets and explosions.  Second, it&#65533;s about a thought-provoking philosophical concept &#65533; in this case, the existence and nature of God &#65533; which most movies don&#65533;t even both with anymore.  Third, the way it handles that concept sets Jones apart from other films that attempt the same, and ultimately fail.Jones, from a book by the same name by Welsh author Rhidian Brook, follows its title character (newcomer John-Paul Macleod), a 12-year-old from a broken home in working-class Wales.  His father scrapes out a living by farming, and Taliesin alternately dodges abuse from his bullying older brother and his classmates at school.  Taliesin&#65533;s life is changed when, during his piano lessons, his elderly teacher Billy (the late Ian Bannen in his last role) introduces Billy to faith-healing.  Soon, Taliesin tries the power of prayer on himself and is miraculously cured of warts.  Building a community around faith-healing, Tal&#65533;s belief in this newfound concept of God is shattered when his activities nearly lead to the death of a local diabetic boy.  Afterwards, Taliesin begins to re-examine what he believes and, more importantly, why he believes what he does.The fact that Jones postulates an answer to one of life&#65533;s ultimate philosophical questions isn&#65533;t unique, but what sets it apart is that the movie fails to cave in to simplistic, sound-byte style philosophy.  Those who have done any amount of philosophical inquiry know that life&#65533;s truths cannot be summarized in a quick quote or a simple phrase, and to do so wrecks the beautiful inquiry that makes discovering those truths so unique.  Unlike other recent Christian movie-fare, like Left Behind and The Omega Code, Taliesin Jones offers the audience a journey of experience, and one that it doesn&#65533;t necessarily shove down people&#65533;s throats, either.  Although God is certainly the focus of the film, a belief in a Christian God is just one possible explanation for what happens, and Taliesin&#65533;s personal concept of God develops in a way that leads him from the trappings of religious immaturity to the makings of an adult.Most movies cannot manage to even get the sound-byte philosophy right in two-hours-plus; Jones manages to encapsulate one possible philosophical experience in its brief 95 minutes.  For those of us tired of movies that simply pander and cater, Taliesin Jones is a refreshing break from the mainstream.  The film wouldn&#65533;t have come together without the strength of the actors involved, and the levels of talent that fully realize the characters is also a relief a movie environment increasingly ruled by cardboard stereotypes.  Taliesin Jones is not a film to miss.",N/A

699578,"This is one of those French film that is really about the complexities of interaction between characters and their interactions with the story and milieu that surrounds them.  The milieu here is the fine jewelry trade, about as elite and luxurious as you can get and, as a result, prone to intrigue and corruption.  Caught in the vortex is Catherine Deneuve as the alcoholic wife of the head of the prestigious house of Malivert.  Her husband and brother-in-law have gotten themselves involved in trading stolen jewels which could send them to jail and destroy their house.  When Deneuve's husband commits suicide by driving himself into a logging truck, Deneuve has to sobber up a bit and contemplate a few precious diamonds that he spoke to her about the day before.  Turns out that Deneuve's character has a past and it involves the original distributor of the stolen gems, a man who left her high and dry years before.  The characters and setting make for a sumptuous tale punctuated with real romantic, nostalgic and regretful, longing, the obligatory chills of a thriller and fine acting.

709237,"I glanced at some other reviews here before inscribing my own (which can sometimes be an unhealthy procedure), and noticed a motif that seems to underline most independent reviewers criticism.  They either find the film to far from ""Memento,"" or to close to ""Memento,"" which is beyond explanation on my part. The fact is, Christopher Nolan does an outstanding job with this film, and nothing more nor nothing less should have been done in the creation and editing of this film.  The truth is, this movie isn't much like ""Memento,"" but more like ""Insomnia.""A reviewer here posted that most of the shots are over-stylized, exaggerated, and uncomfortable to watch. Well, I would suppose that the psychological state of insomnia might exactly reflect those very three states.... but on to the movie.Robin Williams and Al Pacino definitely did a great job with this movie, with Al Pacino definitely taking the more impressive role. You really get the feeling that there was a ""trinity"" between Nolan, Pacino, and Williams going on, much like the ""trinity"" which took place in ""Taxi Driver.""I never saw the original ""Insomnia,"" so I am not going to draw comparisons, all I know is that this movie stands by itself as a fantastically dark, thought-provoking film. I will watch the original, just because this movie was so good.A note on the camera angles and stylizied scenes, good job Nolan, you truly did an epic job portraying that vexing state of mind, the light playing, the speeding up and slowing down, the warping of depth, all very well done here, hope to see more of that coming from you.Cant wait for this one to come to DVD...",Insomnia Region 2

259821,"I just saw Red Dragon this weekend. I tried to maintain an open mind as I am a fan of the movie Manhunter. Red Dragon was nicely done using a style similar to Silence of the Lambs. You will see scenes that will definitely spark the comparison and/or tying the movies together. As in Silence Anthony Hopkins will frighten and compell you. I was happy with all the acting. Edward Norton did a nice job but there is no doubt in my mind that William Petersen did a better job in Manhunter. I was also impressed with Ralph Fiennes job of Dolarhyde, but he was no Tom Noonan. Noonan first made me feel compassion for him then he frightened the hell out of me, Fiennes did not. Dennis Farina was a better Cop than Harvey Keitel and Stephen Lang's acting as the obnoxius reporter Freddy Lounds was far better than Phillip Hoffman's rendition. Michael Mann did a brilliant job with the casting, scenes, sets, and music that gave Manhunter a very unique style. Mann's style I think would have been better in the remake than the Brett Ratner version. The characterizations are so real that you can't turn your eyes away. The camera work and visual effects are some of the best you will ever see. This movie is intellectual and shocking. Why Thomas Harris refused to let them call Manhunter ""Red Dragon"" is beyond me. I have read all his books and Manhunter is my favorite movie made from them. If you don't own a copy of Manhunter and you like mysteries like ""Along Came A Spider"", ""Kiss the Girls"", and ""The Bone Collector"", you need to immediately get it.",N/A
40450,"Some reviewers have claimed that this movie is dated and perhaps corny.  I say that this movie isn't dated at all and that perhaps people being bothered by their conscience, while funny in this movie, is something that can still happen.That Touch of Mink is a hysterical movie that pokes a little bit of fun at innocent Doris Day's conscience.  Going around town in Bermuda, you get to see Day thinking to herself ""They all know!"" while she pictures that the elevator she is standing in is actually a canopy bed.  It's funny.  The movie is just good, clean fun.  Something that many will find refreshing in this day of overly action-packed, sex-driven movies.  I hope that someday movie makers will look back on older movies and realize that they can make good movies without boat loads of sex and violence.  That Touch of Mink is a great example.At any rate, I suspect that those interested in purchasing this DVD have already seen and enjoy the movie.  The DVD is letterbox (not widescreen, for those who care), digitally remastered (though some reviewers have argued poorly and I have to agree), and contains a theatrical trailer.

503431,"This delightfully unique movie would have been very, very easy to have marred.  Fortunately, director William Dieterle maintained a light touch throughout, managing just the right mood for each segment of the film.  What could have easily have been hokey instead is eerie and delightful.PORTRAIT OF JENNIE is unique not just for its subject matter, but for being one of the very, very few films of the Hollywood studio era to have been filmed on location in New York.  Almost always in the 1930s and 1940s, a film that was supposedly set in New York or Chicago would in fact be filmed on a Hollywood back lot.  In this case, that would have been a serious blow to the atmosphere of the film, since the numerous scenes shot in Central Park, with the unique skyline framing the park, creates imagery unlike any other film of the time.The cast overall is quite excellent.  Jennifer Jones is not completely believable in her role, but, then, I am not sure many actresses could have been.  She is asked to age too much during the course of the film, and no adult actress is going to be completely believable as small girl and as an adult.  I always love seeing Joseph Cotton in anything, and this was one of his finest romantic roles.  The cast is filled out with a bevy of notable character actresses and actors, such as David Wayne, Lillian Gish, Ethel Barrymore, Florence Bates, Cecil Kellaway, and Henry Hull.The ending is a bit anticlimactic.  The heart of the story is Eben Adams's (Joseph Cotton) meeting Jennie, and the way she changes at each meeting, until he is able to solve her mystery.  The ending was much ballyhooed by Selznick, with the striking tinted waves, but ironically it pales next to the much quieter, but far more emotionally involving, story of a man and a woman.",N/A
661218,"This 77 minute documentary film is interesting.  It takes us on a tour through Ireland, Scotland, England and Cape Breton where we meet several people who share their experiences, visions, sightings and folk stories regarding fairies.  The people we meet are all charming and the scenery in these locations where faery lore is abundant is equally charming.  I thoroughly enjoyed the film.  It was like visiting with my Nana and Grandpa and hearing their tales of the faery realm.  I felt comforted by the honest matter-of-fact way they shared their feelings, ideas and experiences.  They weren't the least bit worried that they might seem far-fetched or unbelievable because in these countries there is healthy respect for the fey.  I enjoyed experiencing that openness and credibility.  I would tell anyone with an interest in faeries or the Celtic world or in magic to check this documentary out.  The reason I only give it three stars is that I didn't feel it was far-reaching enough. It really didn't knock me over in any way.  I would have been happy as can be to have come across it while channel surfing.  I would have certainly considered it a good program and worth the 77 minutes spent viewing it, though some of it was a bit on the dull side.  However, to order it and pay over...for it was too much.  It doesn't contain anything that any student of faery lore hasn't heard a hundred times.  It isn't a film I would watch again because I got the good of it from the one viewing and it's not profound enough or enlightening enough to warrant repeated viewings. If you can rent it or borrow it from a friend, by all means do so, but you can spend...more productively on other faery information or maybe start an account and save up to visit the Celtic countries personally where you can talk to the people and maybe experience the fey yourself.",The Fairy Faith VHS

One assumes her ex will be responsible for the bills or she has been given a handsome settlement that enables her to continue with her life of trivial pursuits.Enter the men. Three thieves.

So why not stay and see how it goes? Duh?Well predictably it doesn't go well. Motivated by the impoverishing divorce where she can now only access millions of dollars instead of tens or hundreds of millions and protecting her chronically wounded daughter, the mother puts up a mythic defense against the sullying patrimony of society.

563977,"There are so many reasons to watch Buffy, it's impossible to list them in a brief precis:  epic scope, mythic resonance, a completely believable variety of diverse characters, witty scripts, sparkling dialogue, wonderfully realized performances, and even a legitimate scare, here and there, along the way.Every season has its own feel and flavor, and its own self-contained story arc.  The first season, needless to say, introduced all the basic characters and situations, emphasizing humor, courage and loyalty.  The Order of Aurelius, headed by the arch-vampire known as The Master, was Buffy's Season One trial, though it properly only covered half the total number of episodes, the rest being filled out by ""incidental"" horrors of the Hellmouth, where the supernatural manifests itself more than in most places of the world.Against The Master and his sinister, apocalyptic vampire Order, are:  Buffy Summers (Sarah Michelle Gellar), the born ""Slayer,"" whose dharma is to be the one girl in all the world equipped from birth with the strength and stamina to thin-out the vampire ranks and prevent their overrunning the world; her watcher, Rupert Giles (Anthony Stewart Head), an introverted British bookworm and surrogate father, whose knowledge and training are invaluable to Buffy; Xander Harris (Nicholas Brendon), a good-hearted unlucky social loser but pithily witty analyst, whose love and loyalty to Buffy elevate him to the rank of unsung hero/helpmeet; and Willow Rosenberg (Alyson Hannigan), a scholarly computer nerd and gentle soul of great innate wisdom.Added assistance are provided by Angel (David Boreanaz), the vampire with a restored soul who becomes the great love of Buffy's life, and reluctant sometime-helper Cordelia Chase (Charisma Carpenter), the most pathologically self-absorbed beauty queen on campus.The balance of horror and humor in the first season is very well managed, and the cast click together with remarkable chemistry and joie de vivre.  The only flaw in these early episodes is the sometimes laughably low budget, though the show beautifully compensates with clever theatrical tricks, the most notable of which is making the underground Order of Aurelius appear much larger and more populated than it is by the use of a multitude of candles and limbo lighting.The best way to get into the magic that is Buffy is from the beginning  -  and this is it.",N/A
272655,"Bigelow's revisionist vampire picture, cowritten with Eric Red, can be lumped in with all those other revisionist vampire pictures.Adrian Pasdar is an aw shucks cowboy in Oklahoma who hooks up with weird girl Mae, played by Jenny Wright (what ever happened to her?). She brings him home to meet the family, who all happen to be vampires. A little love nip gets Pasdar hankering for some blood, and he reluctantly goes along with the band of psychotic human hunters. Pasdar's dad, Tim Thomerson, tracks down Pasdar and takes him back home. A blood transfusion fixes Pasdar right up, but the pack of vampires follows him, kidnapping his sister. A fiery climax ends this weird little film.Lance Henriksen is the leader of the pack, and he is great. He has never received the recognition he deserved, and I wish ""Millennium"" was still on. Bill Paxton plays ""the crazy one,"" the vampire who enjoys killing. In short, is seems to be the same role Paxton plays every other film or so. Pasdar and Wright are okay as the bloodstruck couple, but there is no real body heat between them (so to speak).My problem with this film is this vague lack of spark throughout the film. Everyone goes through the motions, but no one looks like they are really into this. Like Red's other notorious film, ""The Hitcher,"" this film opens badly. I felt like I sat down in the middle of the film, not the beginning. Pasdar and Wright are not given enough time to generate this Romeo and Juliet kind of love they are supposed to be experiencing. The vampire ""family"" are all nuts, and are not given enough time to show any care for each other, which means we eventually do not care either. Thomerson as the veterinarian dad is very good, but again, in an underwritten part.The film certainly looks good. The special and makeup effects are great, especially the infamous scene of a little fifth grader-looking vampire running down a highway in sunlight and bursting into flame. Bigelow's direction is good, if a little sloppy. There are a couple of editing errors, but she does a good job of keeping things going.When you think things are finally clicking, the film makers throw in a silly scene that makes you rethink your previous joy at the film. The blood transfusions and the second kidnapping of Pasdar's sister (really dumb) just provide grist for the mediocrity.Throw in a completely inappropriate musical score by Tangerine Dream, and this film is a definite mixed bag. I recommend ""Near Dark,"" but with some huge reservations.This is rated (R) for strong physical violence, strong gun violence, strong gore, strong profanity, some sexual references, and adult situations.",Near Dark VHS

592267,"There's not much I can say about writer-director Steve Oedekerk's ""Kung Pow: Enter the Fist,"" a spoof on the kung-fu movies of an era gone by that contains jokes, gags, and humor ranging from chuckle-inducing to all-stops-outs belly laughs. As a humorous play on a overly cheesy film genre that only gets goofier with age, the film follows all the necessary rules; the good news is that unlike such a film as, say, ""Scary Movie,"" you don't necessarily have to be acquainted with movies of this sort to appreciate Oedekerk's brand of humor.Using the elements of the digital age to insert himself as a character in the 1976 Hong Kong film ""Tiger and Crane Fist,"" Oedekerk plays The Chosen One, whose family life was stripped from him in his infant years at the hands of Master Pain, who, in the present, adopts the name ""Betty."" Chosen One returns after many years, bent on exacting revenge against Betty.A pretty lame setup, considering the fact that it was the plot of an actual film. What Oedekerk has done is removed the film's main hero and placed himself and various new characters into the film, all the while providing the replacement voices in the redubbiing process.All of this is corny and cheesy, to be sure, but what is most surprising about the movie is how funny it can actually be if you can get into it. The spoofs of ""The Matrix"" and ""The Lion King"" aren't exactly fresh, but they still manage a good deal of hearty chuckles. The bigs laughs come from the Oedekerk's voicing of his character's lady-love, who spends much of her time running around yelling ""wee-ohh;"" the narration of the story, at times, provides humorous commentary on the present situation, and was I the only one who got a kick out of the tongue gag?What's most enjoyable about a movie like ""Kung Pow"" is that its dialogue fits right in with the body language and movements of its characters; at one point, a highly-revered master breaks into a coughing fit during the middle of a discussion. Oedekerk's solution? Insert a fly that will enter his mouth. This, and many of the movie's sight and sound gags, are cheap in their construction and execution, but still manage to provide one with a well-spent 80 minutes of almost-continuous laughter. Wee-ooh!",Kung Pow! Enter the Fist

385706,"This DVD looks like it was produced in such a way that would not make Beatles fans sorry for what they'd already bought. Do you have &quot;The Making of a Hard Day's Night&quot;? Good thing, because that documentary has a lot more interesting stuff than you will find in the extras, here. Do you already have the laserdisc edition of the movie, released in 1987 by Criterion Collection? Good for you, again - that edition had all the songs in STEREO and included &quot;The Running and Jumping and Standing Still Movie&quot; as a bonus.The DVD format, with its menu features, has created a new standard for supplementary material. Instead of one carefully edited documentary that flows smoothly from start to finish, you get several interviews that you can watch in any order. Some of them are quite interesting, in fact. OF COURSE this is a mandatory item for any Beatles collector. Come to think of it, perhaps they did the right thing by not overlapping with previously released stuff. I just hope &quot;The Making of A Hard Day's Night&quot; is still in print, for the sake of those who hadn't bought it. As for the laserdisc, sorry, it's a dead format, anyway.",N/A

When I bought Titanic, the movie sailed away into my heart, I even burst into tears at the end and that does not happen often when I watch a movie. Titanic is truly ""the ship of dreams"".I floated away into the era of pure granduer and magic as Kate Winslet and Leonardo DiCaprio lit up the screen as Jack and Rose, two young lovers who are absolutely crazy for each other. However, love is hard sometimes. Rose's spirit, compared to that of a wild horse roaming the plains, is what draws herself towards Jack, who really thinks she is the greatest girl in the the world.The sunset is my favorite scene where Rose cries out ""I'm flying"" before she and Jack engage in the most endearing kiss.The Titanic then hits a lone iceburg one night.  The scenes are emotional, filled with pure terror, bitterness, and the ever-lasting screams of the dying.  Fifteen hundred will die.  Along with the sinking comes thrilling chases and hardness of envy.  When the ship sinks, Rose and Jack fight for survial, but in the end their love is star-crossed and Jack dies, but at least they are together again after death.A beautiful movie of tenderness, adventure, and the surival to live or die on the Titanic!",Titanic VHS

I'm big on deleted scenes and the like, and there are quite a few here. Most especially, the expanded beginning sequence that shows/tells about the explosion that killed Buckaroo's dad (and features Jamie Lee Curtis).This is a love-it-or-hate it film, to be sure.

327920,"Dave Hirsch (Frank Sinatra), an ex-soldier and writer whose best work is in his past, returns to his small-town roots only to be confronted by hypocrisy at every turn.  Every element of this meandering drama is predictable and every character a stereotype.  We never get under the skin of Sinatra's character to understand why he is so moody and brooding, thereby compromising his role as a foil for the community at large.  It was difficult to understand the intense loyalty he provokes in the gambler Bama (Dean Martin) and the floozy Ginny (Shirley MacLaine).  Magnificent work by MacLaine and supporting actor Arthur Kennedy, as Sinatra's brother, are not enough to save the film.  The climax is overwrought and predictable.",Some Came Running VHS
476818,"The story element in this movie is good, the fight scenes are typical Jet Li quality (amazing), but the picture quality is so poor it is ridiculous. The picture is never clear, the colors appear as if they were applied with a big crayon, almost pastel in texture and color. The subtitles were just plain terrible. There is a good 3 to 5 minute narrative at the begining of the film that is not subtitled at all, so if you don't happen to speak Cantonese (which I don't) you have to switch the language, this also happens during the film itself, especially during one of the last fight scenes, sure they are talking but there are no subtitles.For some obsqure reason though the sound quality is better than most films of it's age. I've seen a lot of cantonese films from the 70's and 80's in the past few years, and typically it is almost impossible to understand any of what they are saying even if you do speak the language. This has been one of the clearest audio tracks I have heard in a while... I acctually even picked up a few new words (that I will promptly forget before I get the chance to use them).",Shaolin Temple (World Video)
225993,"This film, directed by Ridley Scott, is without a doubt one of finest science fiction films ever.  Resultantly, it is also one of the most effective horror films as well.The casting for the film is excellent.  While Scott was going for the ""truck drivers in space"" look, he succeeded in accidentally finding the perfect middle ground.  Obviously actors aren't going to be as un-photogenic as real truck drivers, but at least his goal moved the casting away from Beautiful People Syndrome that plagues other projects.  This is further built upon with a very ""lived in"" large industrial towing spaceship.  Their clothing also looked used and functional, rather than the product of artistic fashion/costume designers.  I'm struck by how Russian everything looks: the laced-up underclothing that goes under the pressure suit, the space-suit's big round helmet, the woven-cloth insulated wiring on the self destruct controls, etc.  The name Nostromo may also be further evidence that the production designers looked to the Russians for inspiration.  Considering that nation was (and still is) more practical and successful in extended-duration space missions, this reflects well on the filmmakers.Another nice addition was the mention of Zeta Reticuli, which in the alien phenomenon field is synonymous with their home planet as supposedly claimed by the Betty Hill case.  Interestingly, it was not Betty Hill who said that, but a public school teacher & astrologer who erroneously tried to match Hill's star map to known constellations.  The fact that this is completely bogus even if one hypothetically thought there were little gray men does not detract from the film, but is yet another goody for the attentive viewer, especially for one released in 1979.With all these positive comments, it is important to point out how they are presented to the audience.  The acting is very good.  The dialog is always realistic chatter, not the obviously scripted lines of most films.  Multiple characters are often speaking at the same time and there is a sense of room ambience, perhaps because much of the audio was recorded live on set (or evidence of how good the ADR and foley people were).  Much of this chatter is already seemingly underway when the scene switches to it, as if we are observing real events.  With a horror element that is already expertly managed, all of this serves to heighten our involvement in the movie and help us empathize with the characters.",Alien VHS

721587,"I haven't seen any versions of ""Alice"" that match up with what is in my mind. Disney tried vewwy hard and it is a nice, clinical and somewhat sterile interpretation (with some early celebrity flavor in it, as we would see come to blossom in the 1960's with the movies from ""101 Dalmations"" on up). However, I am not reviewing that movie, nor THIS! I am putting in a teeny vote for the 1930's (1933, I think...or maybe '35) version, which had (actually, mebbe it was '36?) W.C.

I stayed home from school in 1975 to watch this film because I had read so much about it in my books on Cary Grant and also WC Fields [plus some other starz!whoze namez! ezcape!me]). Ok, enough. Suffice to say, the 1930's version was pretty neat, and had many of the best special FX guys of the 30's working on it. Put in a vote for the early 1930's version to be released at least on DVD.

399371,"I keep trying to write reviews about this movie, and they either get lost, or I get interrupted. But I'm determined to add my 2 cents about this great movie because I feel so strongly about Jennifer Jason Leighs miraculous performance. She is touched by God (or Satan), because she so totally immerses herself into her role as ""Sadie"", that there is not a hint of ""acting."" She so perfectly captures those downed-out girls I saw in punk clubs in the '70's & '80's (where are THEY now??), and her slide down the gutter of addiction is so real, you may find yourself trying to wipe the droul off your t.v. screen. Sadie's pathetic attempts to ""be somebody"", in light of her sister, ""Georgia"", who not only has ""respectable"" fame, but, a seemingly stable family..etc, is heartbreaking to behold. The nuances of her portrayal are newly un-covereed at each viewing, leaving you just shaking your head in amazement at her performance. I'm surprised some viewers found her interpretation ""mannered"", to put it kindly. Because I recognized her mannerisms, her sad creation of a ""Sadie"" to hide the real hurt inside,as traits I have seen in many troubled people I have known. Hey, you either get it, or you don't. I have always admired Ms. Leighs work, always thought she was an exceptional actress, but this role just ""blew me away"", for want of a better phrase. I don't want to take anything away from all the other actors, stars, superstars, commercial draws, etc..., out there in ""La-La Land"", but this girl is SO much more of an artist, wonder, PRESENCE, that 99% of the others should just forget it. She makes you realize what true talent is, not just a bunch of hype.I almost feel bad about going on about her, because this movie also has one of my all-time favorite actresses,the incredibly gifted Mare Winningham.Her ""Georgia"" is a very subtle, perfect contrast, to J.J.Leighs ""Sadie.""I've always hoped Oliver Stone would make a film of another one of the handful of people who had true, God-given talent, Janis Joplin, and that Mare Winningham would star. She would be perfect. If you can ever get your hands on her early work ""Off The Minnesota Strip""(?), do so, as it is a precursor of J.J.Leighs role as Sadie.She is miraculous in it. The supporting players are all very good also in Georgia, especially John Doe, of ""X"" fame. (One of the best bands EVER!!)They all contribute to make a film which will take you on an emotional ride, no...it's not ""happy"", but, it's worth the trip.You will be in awe at the wonder of the living, breathing, ""Sadie.""",Georgia VHS

593036,"MEN IN BLACK II is not nearly as good as the original, but after seen all the horrible reviews, I was expecting to really dislike it. Fortunately, it wasn't bad at all. Great? No. Horrible? No.The only way that MEN IN BLACK II can be considered a bad movie is in direct comparison with the original. If one were to see this one, never having seen the first, I think the experience would be a very pleasurable one. Will Smith is as likable in this one as in the first, and I enjoyed a lot of the accoutrements from the original are back. Tony Shaloub, one of my favorite character actors, reprises his role as Jack Jeebs, and provides some funny moments. Rosario Dawson was fine in her role, though it could have been a expanded with ease. And Lara Flynn Boyle made a believable and successful villainous. My one disappointment was with Tommy Lee Jones, who I almost always love. His performance was fine, but the script doesn't do nearly as much with his memory loss as they might have, and the completely sudden way he gets his memory back makes for a rough transition. I felt Frank the Pug and the worm guys could have had slightly (or even much) smaller roles.I would recommend this to anyone who enjoyed the original, as long as they realize that it isn't as good as the first one.",N/A

665700,"...then, hooo-boy did you pick the wrong movie.This is a quiet, charming little character piece with no sex, no explosion, and real people doing real things.For anyone born after 1962, it will be a revelation of how important the world thought it was to land on the moon. A history lesson, of a time out of memory or before you were born.For those born earlier, this movie fulfills a dual function. It is a delightfully funny movie with dozens of interesting offbeat characters, and an intelligent plot. It is also the only film I've ever seen that accurately captures the often miserable broadcast quality of the moon landings. Most documentaries and films use footage that the astronauts themselves took on either film or better quality video. The actual broadcast we baby boomers saw live was a shadowy, grainy, nearly indecipherable mess.Filmed on location on the 200-ft wide dish where the events took place, this movie scores big on the little touches: the security guard who is convinced that's Neil Armstrong on his walkie-talkie, the rather unusual selection for the American National Anthem, the cadet hopelessly infatuated with the mayor's rebel daughter, the father who has to keep asking his 8-year old son about the technical details of the moon launch. (Anyone who lived through the time knows how spot on that situation was.) The music choices, ranging from the Australian classic ""The Real Thing"" by Russel Morris to ""Good Morning Starshine"" by Oliver, are accurate for the era and appropriate.Give yourself about 10 minutes into the film to get adjusted to the sometimes thick Australian accents, and you be pleasantly rewarded for your investment.",N/A

The choir voices from the radio while all this is going on is quite effective.The second stars Ian Hendry who deserts his family to run off with his lover but is involved in a car crash which disfigures him. He eventually finds his own way back home to discover his lover is blind from the accident and that he is not too good shape himself when catching a glimpe of himself in a glass table.The third stars the excellent Peter Cushing in a touching and even tear jerking performance as an old man who commits suicide after his rich neighbout attempts to drive him out of his house. A year later he takes his revenge in a superb climax to the story.Story number 4 Richard Greene goes bankrupt and his very silly wife decides to use an old Chinese figurine that grants three wishes to get the money back. Things don't go to plan of course and Greene ends up dead. Won't ruin the film by telling you what happens next. But this is perhaps the most psychologically terrifying sequence i have ever seen.

After CAPTAIN BLOOD proved to be such a gold mine, Warner Bros. put writer Delmer Daves to work adapting another Rafael Sabatini novel THE SEA HAWK; it ranks as one of Flynn's best all-round films, and remains a beautiful picture to see and hear. The 1.7 million dollar budget was lavish by 1940 standards; an enormous new sound stage was inaugurated for the film. Two newly built full-scale ships - one 165' long, the other 135' - both surrounded by 12 feet of water (!) helped make the opening of the movie an amazing, crammed-with-detail piece of filmmaking. The musical score by Erich Wolfgang Korngold was his last for an historical pageant and one of his best; his score splendidly captures the ""sweep and roll"" of 16th century ships. It's interesting to compare Flora Robson's interpretation of Queen Elizabeth I to Bette Davis's. Both are intelligent and convincing, but Robson conveys level-headedness with flashes of temper while Davis (in THE PRIVATE LIVES OF ELIZABETH AND ESSEX, which she made with Flynn one year prior) projects distinctly neurotic and indecisive aspects of her character. Flynn's performance is good and believable; he chose a relatively quiet, restrained delivery here and he was at the apex of his career both looks and performance-wise. The term was ""sea dogs"" was conveniently changed to ""sea hawks"", thereby refuting history and confusing Sabatini buffs, but giving a 'raison d'etre' to the saleable and dramatic title the studio decided to retain.

As expected, this sci-fi adventure is excellent in the visual department, with stunning vistas, brilliantly-conceived worlds, and awe-inspiring and frightening alien creatures. The action sequences are amazing, and the final half-hour delivers simply the best large-scale battle scene in ANY fantasy/adventure (as everybody knows, it concludes with a fight between a dark Jedi and Yoda in a duel that has to be seen to be believed). The dialogue is spotty, but the performances are convincing and earnest (Ewan Mcgregor stands out as Kenobi, and Samuel L. Jackson creates a fierce, honorable warrior in Mace Windu) and the story is interesting and suspenseful.

486039,"I purchased ""Two-Lane Blacktop"" because of a review by Leonard Maltin stating that Warren Oates should have received the Oscar for his role.  I was not let down.  The movie is ostensibly about drag racing, with a cross-country race being waged.  More broadly, the movie addresses the American fascination with speed and excitement.  More importantly, it is a prime example of the type of small American movies that flourished in the 1970s, but are not being made today.  James Taylor and Dennis Wilson star in their only primary acting roles of their careers, and bring a low-key realism to the movie.

683757,"In ""Bubble Boy,"" Jake Gyllenhaal plays Jimmy, a teen who suffers from severe immune deficiency, and is forced to come of age in the confines of a plastic bubble, set up in his parents' suburbia home.  Jimmy is smothered by his obsessively religious mother (Swoozie Kurtz), and doesn't seem to mind till he meets Chloe, the beautiful girl who visits from next door, whom he becomes very close to, and falls in love with.  When Chloe goes off  to get married, Jimmy decides he must pursue her, so he fashions himself a ""travel bubble"" and goes off in search of his true love across the country.Along the way, he meets a wide range of nutty characters, including the performers of a freak circus, the members of a religious cult, a motorcycle gang, and assorted other oddballs.  Gyllenhall (who starred in Donnie Darko as as of late) brings a genuinely sweet and charming quality to his performance as the heroic Jimmy much like Johnny Depp in Tim Burton's Edward Scissorhands.Some folks may find it offensive, some of the humor is pretty over the top, but if you take it for what it is, good silly fun, I think you'll find it charming.  To me, the film was totally appealing and very entertaining, in a Tim Burton Pee Wee Big Adventure kinda way.  I laughed myself silly!",N/A
537039,"Let me start by asking you a question.  When DVD's came out, weren't you happy that a long movie like 'Titanic' would be able to fit on one DVD and not split into two discs like on video?  I'm sure you would answer yes, so that begs the question, what is the purpose of splitting 'Pearl Harbor' onto 2 DVD's?  It is stupid if you ask me.  That is the only reason why I gave this 1 star rather than 3.The movie itself was ok.  The special effects were good, but you could tell that they were special effects, and that always detracts from my enjoyment of a film.  I thought the story was really two movies in one, a love story and a war story.  Each one would have been great on its own, but mixed together they just make for a long movie.  I also thought that Ben Affleck was not that good, and over acted for most if not all of the film.I would not suggest buying this DVD because the film is split onto two disks, and the movie was not that great. Hope this helps you stay away from this purchase.",N/A
298927,"After the success of BACK TO THE FUTURE, a slew of movies about time travel were produced and released. None have ever reached the level of excitement and humor yet without breaking continuity with time travel theory than that film did. Some of the films made were decent, some were terrible, and some were just incredibly funny.  BILL AND TED'S EXCELLENT ADVENTURE was one the funniest time travel films and was a huge hit.Bill and Ted are two California high school losers who can't even play instruments but have a band called ""Wyld Stallions"" (Bill and Ted introduced air guitar to the rest of America outside of LA). The duo want to learn to play and stuff, but they have to graduate from high school and in order to do that they have to get an A+ on their history final.Enter Rufus (George Carlin). Rufus is from the future, a future where peace reigns thanks to the music of Bill and Ted. However, if they don't pass that final, all of Rufus' society will be wiped into oblivion. So, he let's the bumbling duo borrow his time traveling phone booth (anybody seen Doctor Who) and travel throughout history picking up famous people to help them with their report.  Abe Lincoln, Sigmund Freud, Genghis Khan, Joan of Arc, Billy the Kid, Beethoven, and Napolean are all along for the ride. But while Bill and Ted have to find Napolean (ditched by his babysitter) the men and woman of history run wild in the mall and are arrested.The movie is hilarious. True it is totally anachronistic and doesn't follow time travel theory at all, but because it never takes itself seriously, one can relish in the humor. The movie haunted Keanu Reeves' career and the surfer in the actor never left him until he made THE MATRIX. And the rest is, as they say, history.",N/A
415679,"I was only two years old in 1964, but I do know the year as a watershed era in rock music, because that was the year both the Beatles *and* Motown came to the American culture- via television. That said, what really impresses me about ""TTYD"" are the small touches. Director Tom Hanks has been quoted as saying that the songs by Adam Schlesinger (and score by Howard Shore) are original songs- that is, they were written for this film, but they were made, in tempo and arrangement, to *sound* like they came out of the 60's. That's amazing- especially when you re-listen to them. Also impressive are various bits of the day-glo color cinematography, art direction, set pieces (like the Play-Tone 'big record' stage), and even some of the co-stars in their cross country tour (the singer of ""Mr. Downtown"" paying an obvious tribute to Johnny Rivers, and the beautiful ""Chantrellines"" trio a spot-on amalgam of the Crystals, Shirelles, and the Supremes, right down to the coiffed wigs, dresses, hand-claps, and position of the microphones).(P.S.: While I enjoyed Tom Everett Scott immensely, I don't see the resemblance to Tom Hanks that everyone's talking about.

A review on the box said it was a ""psychological thriller in the style of the Blair Witch Project"". So I rented it. I was willing to give it the benefit of the doubt for most, if not all, of the movie. I quite enjoyed the psychological elements of the movie, although my friend did note that the characters spent most of the first half of the movie talking. It was interesting talk, at least. I loved the psychological sessions, and particularly the character of Billy. Princess was good, too. Then there was Simon. I'm not sure how much I can say about where the movie went wrong without giving too much away, but I'll try. At the end of the movie it turns out that it wasn't really a psychological thriller at all. Oh, no, no, no. It turns out it was a... * spoiler alert * case of demonic possession. Well, at least it was an excuse to * spoiler alert * kill off most of the main characters. What occurred to me at the movie's end was that the movie had been ambitious, and the director had clearly tried hard to make it a good movie. Good effort. They almost made it.",Session 9

388819,"Great series, great actors... You could not go very wrong with an adaptation of such a classical masterpiece as P&amp;P, provided that you only follow the book, and this series does exactly that.Without delving too much on the plot and the excelent performances delivered by all actors, I'm just going to note a few differences from the book:1. There is a scene added while Lizzy is at Netherfield tending her sister, which shows Darcy watching her as she plays with a dog from an upper window. This is added to show how his interest in her is piqued.2. There is a scene added right before Lizzy meets Mr. Darcy at Pemberley, showing him training in duel and then taking a bath in the river by the house. I think those were added to show his state of mind and his inner struggle with his feelings. They were good and did nothing wrong to the character.3. The involment of Mr. Darcy in Lydia's wedding is shown as we go along, instead of Lizzy discovering it from her aunt's letter. I liked it better when it was all a surprise right up the moment she got the letter.4. The ending is a little rushed; after Lizzy and Darcy confess their love, we are taken almost directly to the wedding day. We don't see the scene where Lizzy tells her mother about the upcoming wedding, and that scene was great. Also, all the 'future' developments Ms. Austen suggests for the characters -- like Mr. Bennett constantly visiting his daughters, Lydia and Wickham coming to visit, Lydia's letters -- are not included.And two other things:The actress who plays Jane is not as beautiful as she should have been. She acts very well, however.Finally, I gave this DVD four stars not because of the movie -- which despite its flaws is a full 5 star -- but because it has no subtitles. Dialogue is one of the most important aspects in this movie, and with the old English phrasing it was sometimes dfficult to follow, because of the absence of the subtitles.",Jane Austen's Pride and Prejudice Six Piece Collector's VHS
538058,"The idea behind ""Along came a Spider"" is that the director, Lee Tamahori, wants to manipulate and surprise his audience...he does this perfectly.  ""Along came a Spider"" has more twists (exclude the pun) than a spider web.  This, of course, makes most people want to go back and check out each character and see how it all envelops in the end.  It's very confusing, but makes almost perfect sense...well, almost.""Along came a spider"" is the sequel to ""Kiss the Girls""...or maybe it's a prequel?  You don't know.  The one thing you do know is that Dr. Alex Cross, the shady and ruthless detective, is back, reprised by the talented Morgan Freeman.  The beginning of the film is kinda farfetched and silly, when a car flips in the air like a board game dice and holds on by a thread over a dam.  It almost seems like the car has a mind of it's own!  Anyways, Dr. Cross has filed for retirement after his partner was killed in that car, after a sting operation went very bad.  Meanwhile, a international catastrophe goes out of control, when the daughter of a US senator is kidnapped by her teacher and posted as ransom.  The kidnapper, named ""Mr. Soneji"" (played perfectly by Michael Wincott) has unknown objectives to the kidnapping.  Meanwhile, Dr. Cross is thrusted back into action when Soneji calls him at home, wanting to play a game.  Cross is partnered up with a special agent Jezzie (played by Monica Potter) who's is to blame for Megan's (the girl) kidnapping, due to lack of security.  The two go out on the case, searching for Soneji, while the really plot starts to unveal about half-way through the film.ACAS is thrilling and suspenseful.  The only problem is that much of the climax doesn't exactly explain anything.  Most of all, the reason I said it was a ""international"" catastrophe, was because around somewhere in the film, Morgan's friend is the son of the Russian Embassador.  Obviously the Russians are stuck up and act like all of them have a stick up their [end].  In this case, in one scene, Alex and Jezzie stop Soneji from taking Morgan's friend from outside the Russian Embassy.  They almost have Soneji while he's getting away, but then the Russian Embassy guards come out and go postal on the two detectives, as if they were the assisins!  Nevermind.",N/A

541896,"Brilliantly directed by Christopher Nolan, who also wrote the screenplay based on a short story by his brother, Jonathan Nolan, this film had to be a huge challenge for all.  The word ""memento"" means ""remember"" in Latin, and the story is about Leonard, so traumatized by a blow to the head after his wife's rape and murder, that he has lost his short-term memory. He's out for revenge and is looking for the killer, but, although he remembers his life with his wife and who he is, he cannot remember anything that has happened since.  He therefore takes Polaroid shots of everyone he meets and writes notes on them.  And he also tattoos things he wants to remember all over his body. The role calls out for an exceptional actor and Guy Pearce certainly does rise to the occasion.  I found myself drawn to him, identifying with his condition, and joining him in his struggle to relate to the world.The story unfolds backwards, an unusual narrative technique that is tricky to use.  We see a scene and think we understand.  And then there is another scene that has happened prior to it, and it totally changes our perception of what is going on.  Purposely, it is confusing.  And purposely, there are moments of clarity where it all fits together only to become even more confusing in the next scene.  Carrie Ann Moss plays a femme fatal and, as we get to know her, we are not quite sure what her motives are.  Joe Pantolino is cast as in the role of Leonard's buddy, and we are constantly confused as to whether he is friend or foe.I sat there fascinated as this complicated plot unfolded, enjoying the mastery in which the director led me down different avenues of thought and also introduced questions about the moral issues involved.  By the end, I was absolutely sure of nothing at all, except that I had been traveling on a roller coaster of an experience that didn't have any easy answers.  While I tend to want films to have a beginning, middle and end, and a story line that is easy to follow, this an exception to the rule.  I definitely recommend to those who are willing to explore this unique film, which is certainly one of a kind.",Memento VHS
511794,"Transformers The Movie had a lot of competion in the dawn of animated TV-to-movie era. It was in competition with the GI Joe Movie and the Robotech Movie. But out of all of them, Transformers was the only one that stood the test of time.The movie begins in the year 2005 when Cybertron has been taken over by the Decepticons. While Ironhide makes a special shuttle run to Autobot City on Earth, the shuttle is hijacked by Megatron and the other Decepticons. Once hearing of this, Optimus Prime rushes to earth to assist the other Autobots in combat. However, Optimus bites the big one as well as Megatron once Starscream throws him out into space. Soon, Megatron meets the gigantic Unicron and is offered a second chance to destory the matrix.Many fans of Transformers were a bit angry at the fact that so many characters were killed off in the movie. The reason for that was because they saw that in GI Joe, Duke dies, but it was edited out. The writers thought that would be cool and have a greater impact so they went overboard with it. There were too many characters to begin with anyway.This version is the special so called ""PG"" version that was originally released in theaters. I call it the PG version because once it was discovered that Danny's father says the S word in the PG version, they released an unrated edited version that includes a Star-Wars-esque opening. I like this version way better than that of the edited version that was released by FHE. The all-star voice cast includes a range of great celebrities. You may remember Peter Cullens (Optimus Prime) as the announcer for Toonami trailers. Some more famous names are Lenord Nemoy, Robert Stack (Unsolved Mysteries), Scatman Crothers (Roots), Orson Welles (his last film I should mention) and Eric Idle (Monty Python) although you can bearly understand a word he is saying since his voice is distorted in the film.Extras on here are pretty slim, but good extras at that. The first is an interview with Vince DiCola, the composer for Transformers. It's pretty long and mentions a lot of stuff about going through the process of composing music for Transformers. The second extra is a bunch of unused storyboards. These were fun to look at especially since there are descriptions on each storyboard. I would have liked it better if Rhino had included all the Transformers movie trailers.Overall, this is the best version of Transformers The Movie that easily overpowers the Laser Discs.

106472,"Meredith Willson's &quot;The Music Man&quot; was a phenomenal success on Broadway (1957) before it came to Hollywood.  At this point in time, in Hollywood musical history, studios wanted to be certain that they had a &quot;sure thing&quot; before they expended any amount of money on the musical.  Consequently, most of the musicals being made in Hollywood had previously been successful on Broadway.  The same principle applied to &quot;The Music Man.&quot;Director Morton DaCosta and choreographer Onna White also handled the Broadway production and several of the original Broadway cast members were featured in the movie including Pert Kelton, The Buffalo Bills singing quartet and last but not least Robert Preston.  Even though Preston portrayed the dynamic Professor Hill on Broadway, he was awarded the starring role in the movie only after Cary Grant turned down the studio.  Preston's enthusiastic character in the movie, his style, his charm and his personality reflected in Professor Hill are the qualities that went on to make the movie as successful as the Broadway play.  According to Ted Sennett in his book 'Hollywood Musicals,' &quot;His performance is a miracle of energy and drive, perfectly in key to the style and intention of the film.&quot;&quot;The Music Man&quot; centers on down home America, Iowa style, circa 1912.  The crux of the plot involves a fast-talking, good looking, and smooth kind of guy called Professor Harold Hill.  In actuality, he's a con man who goes from small town to small town, making a fast buck.  However, when he arrives in River City, he doesn't realize that he has met his Waterloo.  He proceeds in trying to convince these small town folks that there's 'trouble right here in River City,' referring to the young people who are hanging around with nothing to do.  He puts himself across as a music teacher and tries to get all of the parents to buy band instruments and uniforms in order to form a band that he can instruct.  Wanting to do the best for their children, parents go along with his suggestion, not realizing that he knows nothing about music, bands or band instruments.  Marian (Shirley Jones), the town's librarian sees through his faade but also at the same time, falls in love with him.  The movie ends with the famous song '76 trombones.'The songs in this movie flowed smoothly with the storyline and there was something for everyone.  The production number &quot;The Wells Fargo Wagon&quot; involved members of the whole town, looking and waiting for the Wells Fargo Wagon to deliver all the things that were ordered from the catalogue.  Children and adults alike were all excited about the arrival, which was a big happening in this little town. Robert Preston's rendition of 'Trouble' set the tone for the movie and showed, in music, how he could incite the townspeople and get just what he wanted.  Shirley Jones and Robert Preston vocalizing on 'Till There Was You' made it very clear that they cared deeply for one another and the audience knew, at that point, that he wasn't going to leave River City.  The grand finale, with the marching band playing '76 Trombones' was really the high point of the movie and &quot;...the musical's biggest hit song...which Preston makes virtually his own with every confident stride and strut&quot; (Ted Sennett, &quot;Hollywood Musicals&quot;).  It's a song in the movie where you just had to join in with the music.&quot;The Music Man&quot; is two and a half hours of sheer pleasure. Yes, it was corny, but so were a lot of other musicals.  Maybe that's what made it so appealing.  If it didn't have the staying power it wouldn't be around today, being shown repeatedly on television and being sold on videocassette and DVD.  Robert Preston and Shirley Jones will always be fondly remembered for their excellent portrayals in this movie.",N/A

28933,"With trips to the summit of Everest now quite routine, there are no more places on the surface of the Earth left to explore. The greatest feat of exploration of the past century was the manned landing on the moon. However, it was more a feat of technology than a voyage of discovery. In the nineteenth century, the greatest feat of exploration in North America was the journey of the corps of discovery, where Meriwether Lewis and William Clark led a small expedition up the Missouri river and over land to the Pacific ocean. Sent by President Jefferson shortly after the Louisiana Purchase, their mandate was to map, gather scientific data on the wildlife, search for a Northwest passage to the Pacific and to make contact with the native American inhabitants.  Amazingly, they did all three, being more successful than even the greatest of optimists could have foreseen.Retracing their journey and interspersed with dramatic reenactments, this tape is truly history in action. With no possibility of relief arriving for years, they were required to live on what they could carry as well as what they could find on the land or obtain from the natives. What was most interesting about the tape is the descriptions of their relationships with the various tribes they encountered. Truly, without the active assistance of several tribes, they would have starved to death or have been forced to turn back. In fact, a Shoshone woman named Sacagawea traveled with them for most of the journey, carrying her infant son every step of the way. It is a tribute to Lewis and Clark that they kept such accurate and honest journals. From them, we can learn what happened, and there is no hint of personal embellishment in their writings. In hearing these accounts, you cannot help but wonder if the native tribes understood that their world had changed forever, and of course not for the better.I have traveled most of their route by vehicle, and when you move up the mountains, you cannot help but be impressed by how difficult it was for them to move over them by horseback. Keep in mind that they were also carrying extensive munitions, goods for trade and other miscellaneous necessities. Furthermore, there was only one fatality among the members of the corps, and that was most likely appendicitis, something that no medical person on the planet could have successfully treated.The journey of Lewis & Clark irrevocably changed the social structure of half of what is now the continental United States. This tape is an accurate historical account of their adventure and should be a requirement for graduation from high school.",N/A

547281,"A good war film, about the creation of the modern Israeli army and the creation of the state of Israel.  Kirk Douglas plays a recently demobilized American military expert who returns home from WWII only to find he still has fighting and wanderlust in his blood.  A cloak-and-dagger offer to help train the beleagured Jewish militias is all he needs to tell his wife, ""honey, I'll write you soon!"" and zip off to the promised land.  The film is very one-sided and romanticized, yet compelling... In retrospect, historians have argued that the Israelis weren't as badly outgunned in 1948 as the official version implies, but I'm sure it was still bad enough.  Guest appearances by John Wayne, Frank Sinatra (who phoned in role as a happy-go-lucky fighter pilot) and Yul Brynner make this a bona fide Epic Film, but you might find your attention wandering more towards the Sophia Loren-alike hottie, Senta Berger, who plays Kirk's Israeli love interest.

147855,"On second viewing, ""Fargo""'s fun and surprises diminish considerably. A black comedy set against a stark and desolate white snowscape, the Coen brothers' film registers its effects through three primary devices: the variation on film noir conventions, the constant juxtaposition of incongruities, the opportunistic use of local color. But most of the film's success depends less on cinematic originality than on the colorful, memorable performances of Frances McDormand, William Macy, and Steve Buscemi. Shot mostly in cars and tight interiors, ""Fargo"" is neither a northern epic nor an intricately plotted Warners Brothers crime yarn. It's a ""three actor"" drama that, in the end, comes up somewhat short in credibility, depth, and meaning.While Ingmar Bergman's Swedes use the desolate landscape as a theatrical stage for poignant meditations on the existence of God and the meaning of human existence, the Coen brothers' characters are pretty much clueless about anything beyond eating, sleeping, and getting on with life. The characters' ""yah's,"" ""you betcha's,"" and ""thanks a bunches,"" while fully recognizable localisms on first viewing, seem overdone the second time around (in fact, this time the performance of the two prostitutes struck me as the stuff of a ""Saturday Night Live"" skit).I wouldn't mind seeing the film yet another time, provided it was in the presence of someone who hadn't seen it. But one almost wishes the Coen brothers could have consulted Garrison Keillor on the script of this project, in which case genuine characters might have replaced the caricatures the film serves up. Or maybe it would have been enough if they had simply tuned into some of those NPR Saturday night broadcasts. They would have discovered that the people of Lake Wobegon know something the filmmakers apparently do not--that the unexamined life is unfit to be lived.",N/A

543124,"I hesitated to see this film because having seen my share of Kristen Dunst movies, I wasn't sure I was ready for another teen sugar attack.  However, this film turned out to be a pleasant departure from the perky candy coated parts Dunst has played in the past.  In fact, this might be a watershed role for her, marking her transition from teen roles to adult roles.Dunst plays Nicole Oakley, a troubled teenager from a privileged family who falls in love with Carlos (Jay Hernandez), a boy from the wrong side of the tracks.  The story is nothing new, but the presentation is remarkably good, with far greater maturity than one would expect from a high school flick.This film is exceptional considering its limited budget and the fact that most of the major players have very little experience at this level.  For writers Phil Hay and Matt Manfredi, this is their first feature film screenplay.  For director John Stockwell, it is only his second feature film.  Likewise for Jay Hernandez and Taryn Manning.  Many of the Latino actors were cast from a local high school, so they are in their first film.  By comparison, Kirsten Dunst is a jaded veteran.  The use of so many ordinary (not professional actors) high school students in the film gives it a very genuine look and feel.Stockwell turns in an impressive directorial effort with a story that is much more complex than it seems at first blush.  It starts out as your standard boy-meets-girl love story.  They flirt, act silly, have sex, fall in love and create beautiful romantic images on the beach.  Just when you think it is going to be a real yawner, things begin to get complicated.  Stockwell slowly peels away the layers of the two main characters and their families to reveal subterranean shearing forces that will act to tear them apart.Nicole, who at first seems to be just a wild, rebellious brat, turns out to be far deeper and more emotionally unsettled than one would ever imagine.  Carlos' humble roots and burning ambition bring the relationship to a breaking point when he has to decide between Nicole and his shot at Annapolis.  Stockwell takes what could have been a trite teen romance and turns it into an engaging character study.  While his pace is perhaps a bit too deliberate and inclusive, his sensitive treatment of the motivation of the characters and his style of unraveling their psyches slowly before our eyes makes for great drama.  This film is full of ""ahah"" moments, where you find yourself re-evaluating the characters as some new piece of information is revealed.Kirsten Dunst has had an active career, appearing in over twenty films before the age of twenty (which age she will attain in April 2002).  This is by far her best performance, helped by the fact that it is the most complex character she has ever played.  There was a hint that her ability extended beyond the superficial teen characters she normally plays in the film ""Virgin Suicides"", where she played a sullen, bad girl with some serious problems.  As Nicole in this film, she shows us that she has extraordinary range.  She really cuts loose with the character, taking her to exhilarating and uninhibited highs as well as crashing, depression ridden lows.  Though this is a minor film from a box office perspective, this performance should get the attention of casting directors and open the door for her to get bigger, more serious parts.  Jay Hernandez shows promise, although he seems a little wooden in this film.  His great strength (other than his obvious good looks) is his sincerity.  He comes across as if he means every word he says.I was going crazy trying to figure out where I had seen Bruce Davidson (who played Tom Oakley) before.  He played Willard in the film of the same name (1971) about a sociopathic kid who befriended rats and used them to attack his enemies.  Davidson gives a good performance here as Nicole's congressman father, particularly in the touching scene at the end.Herman Osario, Miguel Castro and Tommy De La Cruz were all cast for their first film in open auditions from thousands of Latino high school students.  They provide the film with some of its lighter moments as Carlos' friends, and they all give fantastic performances, basically being themselves.  Taryn Manning rounds out the cast as Nicole's best friend and does a fine job of playing the wild thing.I liked this film more for the drama than the romance.  I rated it an 8/10.  Kirsten Dunst takes a quantum leap with this performance.  It is not for impatient viewers or those who despise slushy romances.  However, for those who like a good character study with emotionally charged content and complex characters it is well worth a look.",Crazy/ Beautiful
590626,"but it's his performance that makes this movie.  A Beautiful Mind is an engaging film.  Not a great movie, but a very good one.  As has become rather expected in movies by the &quot;better&quot; American directors, the ending is pure schmaltz.  I presume studio pressure had a lot to do with it--which is an excuse that is unavailable to Mr. Speilberg, who has transformed himself into the king of schmaltzy endings.  But, I digress.Part of Crowe's approach to acting is to notice and replicate certain &quot;tics&quot; that become the nucleus around which his performance can spin, react, and coalesce.  But, unlike many lesser actors, these &quot;tics&quot; do not devolve into cliches.  He uses them as windows into the character's soul.  Here, John Nash's fingers do a figure eight on his forehead when the stress around him builds.  It's as if he is both shielding himself from the world and also wishing away demons with some arcane incantation.  Crowe's portrait of a man transformed by events beyond his control should have earned him an Oscar.  This truly was the performance of the year, and not a throwaway like Crowe's performance in the mediocre Gladiator.  But, apparently, he was even too rude and boorish for Hollywood (which is saying something when major stars can still win Oscars after attacking people with golf clubs).Jennifer Connolly won an oscar for her role, but I'm not quite sure why.  Her performance is adequate, but the role is thin and her range of emotion is merely ordinary.  There is one scene where she is driven into a rage of frustration, shattering a mirror in the process, but that is the only shining moment for her.Now if we can only get Mr. Howard to get off the schmaltzy ending train ...",N/A

677019,"Moulin Rouge is theatre as it should be. It is a feast for the senses, an enthralling and captivating spectacle that entertains, exhilarates, and grips the emotions. This is more than a movie: It is an experience. On more than one occasion I almost wanted to rise to my feet and applaud. For this reviewer, at least, Moulin Rouge was an absolute riot.For those who think the musical genre could never work again, save in the context of a Disney cartoon: Think again. The movie-musical receives here a glorious resurrection. Musical numbers are pulled off with style, wit and imagination, and the tongue is never far from the inside cheek, meaning that we never feel we are watching a movie that belongs to an earlier time. Tunes are drawn from an entire century or more of music, often hilariously executed (if I tell you that Madonna's Like a Virgin is staged in the mode of a show-stopping, toe-tapping Broadway musical number, you will gain an idea of the general tenor of the picture). The film's terrifically old-fashioned conventions are given a modern lilt, and are met with a refreshing and creative energy at the hands of veteran director, Baz Luhrmann (Strictly Ballroom, Romeo and Juliet). Shades of Shakespeare are everywhere seen. Stylistically, we are in the surreal world of Jeunet and Caro (Delicatessen, Amelie). Musically, this is in a category of its own, quite unparalleled.Don't be fooled into thinking this is nothing more than a cracked attempt at a musical revue. That was exactly the impression I had from the trailers, and it was with suspicion and hesitation that I rented this movie, at the recommendation of a friend. I wasn't to be disappointed: I had tremendous fun watching Moulin Rouge, and hope you will too.",N/A
322857,"It's hard for me to believe that there is anyone out there who hasn't seen Coppola's 3 Godfather movies.  If there is such a person, he or she would be well advised to buy this set.  Don't believe what people say about the 3rd part being a stinker either.  It may not be quite as stellar as the first two films but it is a worthy conclusion to the film saga and is necessary to bring closure to the series.  A &quot;Who's Who&quot; of the acting world, this film trilogy uses just about anyone who became big in the 1970s as an actor plus big actors from other eras as well. There's Marlon Brando's return to the big time in the first film as the pater familias of a New York City mob family, the godfather himself.  However, even more identified with this film series is Al Pacino, who stars in all 3 films as the the godfather's son who is reluctant to enter the family business but then shows himself to have even more natural talent in it than his father did.  Robert DeNiro plays the Brando role in the 2nd film but is the &quot;young&quot; godfather starting out in New York.  He is superb.  Robert Duvall is the family lawyer in the first two films and his brash, overbearing style here is hard to imagine when juxtaposed with quieter, later roles of his, showing us the full range of his talent.  Diane Keaton as Michael's wife brings the thankless job of being a mob wife totally home. The late John Cazeles is wonderful as Michael's weak brother, Fredo.  And you see James Caan here in the role that he would play for the rest of his career, Sonny Corleone, the hot headed brother of Michael's, who doesn't have enough control over himself to take over his father's position. Artistically I think Coppola went even higher with his &quot;Apocalypse Now,&quot; &quot;One From the Heart&quot; and &quot;The Conversation&quot; but why split hairs? He's a formidable talent and most of his work, including this trilogy, shows that.",N/A
537020,"What PEARL HARBOR strives to be is the ""Titanic"" it never was. Sure, it's a blockbuster, but the movie is far from getting a Best Picture Oscar nomination, except probably for the special effects and sound effects.PEARL HARBOR is counting the days until and after the Day of Infamy, December 7, 1941, all the while spinning a somewhat uneven romantic triangle between Kate Beckinsale, Josh Harnett and Ben Affleck. Affleck and Harnett are top-notch pilots, while Beckinsale is an adorable nurse whom they both love.PEARL HARBOR is a uneven movie that tries to be the ""Titanic"" of 2001, and turns out to be a pale imitation. Sure, it's not good, but it's far from being a expensive piece of eye candy. What we get from the movie is countless cameos from Cuba Gooding Jr. and dozens more; an uneven romantic subplot with the most awful romantic dialogue there is; a frightening, realistic 30 minutes as the Japanese bomb Pearl Harbor; and a sad ending.I prefer TITANIC over PEARL HARBOR because the story focuses more on the characters and events surrounding them, whilst PEARL HARBOR unevenly paces the many subplots it's sagging with, no tension as the battle rages on and off the battlefield, and all of the characters aren't fully fleshed out.If you're looking for a good tear-jerker, this isn't your flick.

584936,"I saw Spider-Man last night at a sneak preview sponsored by a famous food company.  As a lifelong Spider-Man fan, I was very pleased with Sam Raimi's faithful interpretation of Stan Lee and Steve Ditko's character, and his world.  The writing couldn't have captured the spirit of the comic any better, and the casting was truly inspired.  Unlike so many other comic book movies, Spider-Man brought the best of the series to the screen without needless changes aimed at ""marketing"" to a broader audience.My only complaint with the film was the Green Goblin's costume.  Defoe is one of Hollywood's greatest modern faces, he can convey a broad range of emotions simply by changing the expression on his face. Yet in Spider-Man his face is covered with a metal shell which doesn't move at all.  Not even when he speaks.

A departure from the sleazy sets of Dr. No and Goldfinger. Nonetheless, I never expected myself, a die-hard Connery fan, to say that George Lazenby blows everyone away in the contest for the best Bond. He and Diana Rigg make the most stylish pair of all. She: coolly intelligent yet girlish and spoiled. He: brutish strength yet disarming boyishness. The Combination: Sexy and suspensful -- for REAL. When she teases and manipulates him, we can't tell which side she's on. When he kicks huge guys' a**es and outruns expert hitmen, we totally believe it. Not to mention, when he makes the girls squeal, we know he loves it! He delivers the lines with force AND humor, well suited to the context. Unlike Moore who just delivered it all with a smirk, or Connery who was so conflicted and serious. Lazenby also looks the best of them all in a kilt. Now, I KNOW Connery IS Scottish and I KNOW Diana and George hated each other during the filming, but that's just how it is. Wish he'd made another.

286065,"This 1941 film is the Hollywood life of George Armstrong Custer - the cadet with the lowest marks and the highest demerits in the history of West Point. He only excelled in horsemanship and swordsmanship. It begins with his arrival as a cadet from Michigan; his hero was Murat. In need of officers, he is sent to Washington. He meets General Winfield Scott and is sent to the front. Custer helps to prevent a defeat at Gettysburg by repulsing Stuart's cavalry.Back in civilian life he is offered the chance to lend his name to a business: to sell stock on his reputation, and gain a government monopoly. Custer rejects this deal. His wife meets General Scott and asks that he be placed on the active list. He is, and assigned to the Dakotas. He finds Fort Abraham Lincoln in disarray: slackness, a lack of training, drinking, and selling guns to the Indians. He imposed order on the 7th Cavalry. But his hot temper drew him into a trap. One scene explains the writing of ""Garry Owen"" and its adaption by the 7th Cavalry.The film shows the Great Plains Indians defended their homeland against the invaders. Defeated, they promise to keep the peace treaty as long as their sacred Black Hills were not invaded. But greedy gold seekers came, and the war was renewed. The railroad company and their politicians wanted to bring in new settlers, and profit from this. You can read about this in the history books.General Custer was given orders to pursue the Indians and do as he thought best. His regiment proceeded up the Rosebud towards the Little Big Horn river. The film shows them chasing a small group that draws them into a trap - the oldest trick in the book! Into the valley of death rode the three hundred; someone had blundered. On the 100th anniversary of the Declaration of Independence America learned of Custer's last stand. Custer found fame and glory from his defeat.

Joined by gutter-mouth announcer Joey Styles and aggravated World Heavyweight Champ Shane Douglas, you will see why this DVD beats anything you have seen from Vinnie Mac's company.1. Jerry Lynn vs. Justin Credible- If you ever saw these two men only on the WWF, you will be very surprised. Reverse slams, power bombs and lots of hurrincanranas abound as both men fight off in the supposed final chapter of their rivalry. Lynn does a hurrincanrana that sends Credible diving through a table outside the ring. But Credible fights back, and with the aid of his cronies, lands a piledriver on Lynn from the top rope to get this show cooking! ****1/22. Lance Storm vs. Chris Candido- Former friends collide in the weakest but also safest match of the night. Don't let that drop your confidence, because they still do some extreme work. A huge chop fest and a superplex out of the ring are this match's highlights. Whoops, how can I forget the moment with Tammy Lynn Stych and the powder, or Candido's huge power bomb off the top rope?! ****3. Masato Tanaka vs. Mike Awesome- DANGAN! This is the bestest best battle I've ever seen between these two titans. This can't be just a hardcore match; it's a strategic hardcore confrontation where aerial flight, steel chairs and a table all come into play at the hands of both these men. You'll scream ""Holy S."" when Awesome leaps over the ropes to land on Tanaka, and this senor's almost 300 pounds! But that's not all. Awesome lands 4 steel chair shots that almost breaks the seat of the chair onto Tanaka's head, and Tanaka still kicks out! However, you'll love Tanaka even more when he dashes 70 feet to cave in a chair on Awesome's head (""Mike Awesome went down like a giant redwood tree!""), throws Awesome OVER the rope through a table outside (THE BEST TABLE BUMP EVER), and lands a tornado DDT through two stacked chairs to get the win. This match especially had the crowd going wild at the end, and it shocked Styles and Douglas from head to toe. Check it out! *****+++4. Sabu and Rob Van Dam vs. Hayabusa and Jinsei Shinzaki- If you love airborne warfare, you got it when two wrestlers each from two different companies (ECW & FMW) square each other off for the ECW Tag Titles! Undoubtly, Hayabusa and Shinzaki fly off the rings and injure Sabu and Rob with plenty of strikes to the face and chests. But the extreme tag team rocket themselves with full power, trapping each of their opponents to nightmarish double teams and terrific head-busting chair shots. They also gain the final advantage as Hayabusa and Shinzaki are simultaneously drop-kicked through a single table by Sabu and the Whole Effin' Show! What a match, but it loses points only for two mistakes in the match (Missed chair catch and broken table leg). ****1/25. Taz vs. Bam Bam Bigelow- This is a wild, fast-paced brawl with the goliath Beast From the East trying to tear apart Taz before the suplexing machine can have a title shot against none other than Douglas himself! Spills outside of the ring, but once the match gets back inside, BBB then smashes Taz through a table. Taz fights back, and gives Bigelow his own medicine, suplexing the giant onto that same table! Back out of the ring, Taz tornado DDTs BBB through the ramp floor, causing both to fall inside! (""They killed each other!"") But just as it seems only Bigelow had the strength to get back up from the fall, out pops Taz as he finishes off Bigelow with a Taz-mission, and forces Douglas to accept that his days as a champ are about to be numbered! ****1/26. Dudleyz vs. Tommy Dreamer, Sandman, and Spike Dudley- The final match has got nothing on technical skill, but this brawl will have you laughing at the insanity of it all. Several chairs, a ladder (they could've used all three), and a table all are demolished in this insane feud for vengeance for Beulah's (Dreamer's girlfriend) injury! The story is one worth telling, as the Dudleyz obnoxious buddies, including fatty boy Joel Gertner, taste the wrath of the odd trio from chair shots to piledrivers! The match ends rather abruptly with a ddt on Bubba-Ray Dudley by Tommy Dreamer through a ladder, but just as it seems to be done, in comes Jack Victory to help out the Dudleyz. But wait! Out comes New Jack to deliver some comeuppance to Victory and the Dudleyz! New Jack throws a few garbage weapons for Dreamer, Sandman and Spike to fulfill the revenge and get those losers out of there. Oh, and did I forget to mention that Jack Victory gets planted on the head by a brutal guitar shot?!Tommy Dreamer was perfectly right at the end, when he said, ""It's safe to say...that Dayton, Ohio...is EXTREME COUNTRY!""****So if you love hardcore battles, if you enjoy table spots in almost every match, and if you think ECW was not the greatest company in U.S. wrestling, grab this dvd now and see what you've been missing.

357595,"Sam Peckinpah (""The Getaway"") delivers his usual blend of action and paranoia in this 1983 sleeper, which stars the underrated Rutger Hauer as a investigative TV reporter out of the Mike Wallace mold, and John Hurt as the CIA operative.  Burt Lancaster as the national security chief reprises his role as an overzealous cold warrior type (like he played in ""Seven Days in May"").  The plot takes off when Lancaster, the frequent target of Hauer's hit pieces for his civil liberties violations, turns Hauer over to Hurt, who reveals that Hauer's business partners (Craig Nelson, cast against his ""Coach"" type as a ruthless businessman, and the ever-edgy Dennis Hopper) are traitorous subversives selling government secrets to the communists.Soon the plot takes several twists and turns and everyone is mice trapped in a maze with the cat having just been dropped in.  ""The Osterman Weekend"" starts off as a traditional espionage thriller as a red herring just to fool you, but becomes a paranoid psychological manhunt which will leave you wondering who is the good guy and who is the bad guy (which I won't give away here).The acting is top notch, especially Hauer;  It is such a shame seeing an actor with such a fine sense of timing and the ability to impart dialogue with intelligence, wit and subtle power, being trapped in made-for-cable and miniseries supporting roles.  ""The Osterman Weekend"" shows off the full power of his dramatic acumen , and is up there with his performances in ""Fatherland,"" ""The Hitcher"" and ""Inside the Third Reich.""  Lancaster and Hurt are chilling as the tough-guy spook and the manipulative psychological warfare agent, respectively.  I still say that *no one* can deliver an impassioned speech better than Lancaster, and he's in top form here.So, treat yourself to a great psychological thriller that's almost as great as ""The Manchurian Candidate,"" with the devastating action and shoot-em-up pyrotechnics you expect from Sam Peckinpah.

The disc offers quite a lot of information and footage:  the documentary itself covers the Carpenters from their beginnings as a jazz trio to the A&M; hits to Karen's tragic death at the age of 32.  The disc has lots of extras too:  A portion of the Carpenters performance at the White House, some of their commercials, and a listing of singles and albums in the discography section.

The DVD tells briefly about Karen's wedding, but doesn't even mention who she married!!!  What was it that made Karen such a tragic figure?  What is Richard doing now and how did the end of the Carpenters change his life?  Maybe I'm asking for too much and maybe all this is still too painful for the family to deal with.  I don't think fans are asking for tabloid-type reporting.  I do think a lot of fans sincerely want to know what was going through Karen's mind, what demons she was dealing with and what Richard is dealing with now.  Maybe that's too much for them to present to the general public.

661866,"I've been wanting to get this movie since reading a rather breathless review on Planet Out a couple of years ago.It's a better movie than I expected, but you should know it's not a gay love story.  Our hero, Pol, played by Alan Paule, is determinedly hetero but turns to hustling to raise money for his impoverished family.  To this end, he goes to Manila and becomes a male (macho) dancer in a sex club.  You may make of that what you will, the film, is non-judgmental.  Pol maintains a certain detachment from his chosen craft; the cover art for the CD is taken from the one scene in which he genuinely seems to enjoy being erotic with another guy and Pol's lovemaking scene with Bambi, a cute, sassy young female Philippino in the same situation, is the hottest scene in the movie.There's only one character in the film who appears to have homo-erotic tendencies, Noel, played by Daniel Fernando, and he ends up tragically.  His was the more interesting and attractive character to me.  There's only one gay kiss that isn't just for the sake of the show at the sex club and Pol is genuinely surprised that Noel would kiss him on the lips other than when they're on stage.There is a lot of simulated eroticism and near total male nudity, even a little total male nudity (one brief scene in which a bunch of the dancers are on stage masturbating - shot from across the room, not close up) and a lot of simulated sex acts.  Pol is pretty good at undulating and gyrating in a g-string; Noel is even better.Maybe as much as a third of the movie consists of these scenes of male dancers, serving as backdrop for a morality tale involving Pol and Noel and Noel's sister in which the heavy is the police official who ""protects"" this aspect of Philippino society.  To the extent the film is a commentary on social conditions which give rise to all of this prostitution, it paints a much direr picture of the young Philippino girls who are drawn into this trade than of the young men.  I've read the film is a searing indictment of the corruption that existed under the Marcos and Aquino regimes.  I lack the knowledge of Philippino society to judge this statement, but ""The Comedians"" with Richard Burton and Elizabeth Taylor was a searing indictment of life in Haiti under Papa Doc and this film has nowhere near the power of that one.So much of the film is devoted to the scenes at the sex clubs it's difficult to believe the filmmaker was simply producing an indictment of political corruption but I'm not sure what else to make of it.The acting is better than I expected, as is the filmmaking, but this DVD was produced from a very old and scratchy copy of the film and is the worst visually I've ever seen.Planet Out is incapable of giving anything less than a breathless review to any film in which at least one malecharacter takes his shirt off but I give this film only 3 stars.",N/A

The cast acquits itself honorably, and the movie is very entertaining, yet it lacks either the pervasive foreboding of ""The Silence of the Lambs"" or the stylishness of ""Manhunter,"" Michael Mann's original film version of Thomas Harris' novel of ""Red Dragon."" Brett Ratner is a good journeyman director; he paces the movie well, and gets a good share of thrills from the terrifying story. But he lacks the distinctive style of either Mann or Jonathan Demme. Compare how Ratner and Mann stage the ultimate fate of the sleazy tabloid reporter played by Stephen Lang in ""Manhunter"" and by Hoffman in ""Red Dragon."" The basic situation is horrific beyond belief, but Ratner's staging is pedestrian compared with Mann's, which rolls down the garage ramp into our nightmares. Among the ""Red Dragon"" cast, Fiennes and Watson make the most of their satisfyingly showy roles, but once again it is Hopkins, with his dead-fish stare and malevolent grin, who is the truly unforgettable and indispensable member of the cast.",N/A

507685,"Takeshi ""Beat"" Kitano has gained notoriety and acclaim in Japan as well as a large fanbase in the States, mainly due to his unique genre of films and his uncompromising vision and style.Kitano does a great job in all of his films in protraying the brutal and violent world of the Yakuza, usually playing a character that seems cold at first but eventually having some amount of humanity in him. A common theme I have noticed in many Kitano films is the ""unhappy ending"". No peaches and cream here folks.The title Violent Cop sums it up pretty nicely. Kitano plays Azuma, a cop who goes beyond the line that cops cannot cross legally. The movie is much deeper than the title suggests, however, because there are underlying themes of humanity, honor, and consequence. Tarantino has nothing on Takeshi, and after watching Violent Cop you can see why. Not many can pull off cold and brutal as well as Kitano can, and his characters are always intriguing.This film isn't Kitano's best, but it's up there with ""Fireworks"" and ""Sonatine"".

519718,"I am really not quite sure what to say or how to start it. I have never been interested in this legendary story, and this movie hasn't converted me. It is very easy to look at, but it's hard to to follow and hard to keep your attention to it. Director Peter Jackson has, without a doubt, delivered a magnificent looking film. He has created an unbelieveable world thanks to J.R.R. Tolkien, and brought to life some pretty good characters. Still, it wasn't enough for me. Everything about this film is marvelously done and made and acted, but I wasn't swept up by it. Here's the story - A magical ring falls into the hands of a young hobbit named Frodo Baggins(Elijah Wood), who sets out on a journey to Mordor, to destroy the ring. He is aided and guided by a magical wizard named Gandolf(Superbly done by Sir Ian McKellen). He is also supported by three other hobbit friends, led by Sam(Sean Astin). Along the way they meet up with Aragorn(Viggo Mortensen), an elf(Liv Tyler), and assorted other characters(Played by John Rhys Davies, Orlando Bloom, and Sean Bean from ""Goldeneye""). Also on hand is horror and film legend Christopher Lee, who gives a fantastic performance that will no doubt make his legion of fans smile proudly. The old master still has it. The storytelling is rich and deep, without question, but I could just never get involved with it. The landscape and cinematography is wonderful and, at times, extremely beautiful. The movie might of floundered if it were held together by a lesser cast. That's the best thing this film has going for it. The cast. Sir Ian is the very best of the bunch. You watch every single frame he's in. Listen to every word he utters. It's hard to say that about the others, but they are all still good. Clocking in at a near 3 hours, the film runs pretty long and certainly drags in a few places, but it usually picks up with some kind of heart pounding scene that grabs your attention. The loyalists and fans will no doubt be pleased and satisfied, but newbies to the story might not be as swept away by the film itself. The effects and all that, sure, but I doubt they will be as excited for the next chapter as the fans. As for the upcoming sequel, I'll wait for cable.

408249,"Up there with Bunuel's work as an analysis of elitism and also up there with &quot;Cannibal! The Musical!&quot; as the strangest (and funniest) musical ever made, this is a treat.Its length can seem intimidating, but it goes by quickly.  The opening half has a lot of the feel and wit of Victorian drawing room comedies, only infinitely more scandalous and blasphemous.  After the 13th Earl of Guerney buys the farm in rather spectacular fashion, it goes to his son, Jack.  Only Jack would prefer Joshua; you see, he thinks he's Jesus Christ.  This naturally scandalizes his uncle, who of course is out for the family money.To blow what follows wouldn't be fair, because you won't see it coming.  Suffice to say this goes from being light, witty comedy to something much more serious; the line I quoted above closes out the film and it's one of the more chilling things you'll hear.This is highly recommended.

535215,"I watched this movie in the summer, but from that one viewing, I couldn't really review it. So I waited, and I got it again last night and watched it twice.A second viewing is required to fully enjoy this movie. A first viewing, and you will say, ""Pretty good!"". A second viewing and you will say, ""This is so awesome!""-and every other word that is a synonym to awesome.Slick, stylish, funny-everything you could want in this type of movie. Intermixing storylines give this movie a nice touch, especially when a person from one of the storylines does something that impacts the other storyline without even knowing it.Each character in this movie contributes to the overall effect. By themselves, the characters may be boring. Together, each and every character compliments the other characters, meaning that they all suddenly become a whole lot funnier and more interesting.The reason I needed the second viewing was also because I couldn't understand half of what was being said the first time I watched it. The second time, everything became clear, and suddenly, I understood the whole plot. The third time I watched it, I could understand 5/6 of what Mickey was saying. (and that is an accomplishment in itself) Even if you don't understand the characters (and as you see, half the characters in the movie itself can't understand Mickey either) it is still an enjoyable film. The best parts in this are definitely the ones where the storylines touch each other. Example-the three cars scene, the hallway scene, and even the dogs and a hare scene.Tyrone and his ""funny angle"" part held a special laugh for my cousin, who backed into a Jaguar one day, and said almost the exact same thing.Great acting from every single actor/actress here. This is the third film that I've watched with del Toro in it, and he hasn't disappointed me yet. (the others were Traffic and The Usual Suspects) Brad Pitt did a worthy job as the ""piker""/gypsy and Statham was great as Turkish.The best-character-in-the-movie award has to go to...the dog (or the ""dag""). I LOVED the dog-he has the best part in the movie. I won't reveal anything, but let's just say that the name of this movie is most likely derived from this dog.Also has a killer ending, and a great climax with the boxing match. You don't even really have to see the first movie (yes, this is a sequel) to understand this one-I certainly haven't watched the first yet (called Lock, Stock, and Two Smoking Barrels) but I understood everything in the movie.

221815,"""Chinatown"" arguably represents Jack Nicholson at his very best in his most enduring role, despite not having received an Oscar for his effort.  Fortunately Robert Towne netted an Oscar for Best Original Screenplay in what film experts consider one of the greatest scenarios ever written.  Screenwriting guru Syd Field has used the Towne script as a working model for a generation as a teaching guide.The muted photography of cinematographer John A. Alonzo along with the neatly selected settings reveal Los Angeles in 1937.  Jack Gittes is a Los Angeles detective initially used as a fall guy in a battle for water rights.  The longer Nicholson as Gittes investigates, the more convinced he becomes that the man behind the skullduggery, which ultimately results in the murder of Horace Mulwray, the honest head of the Department of Water and Power who does not want to build a new dam and risk a tragedy such as the earlier described Van Lipp disaster, is super wealthy Noah Cross, played by John Huston.Gittes is a man used to dealing with criminal minds less powerful and less ruthless than Cross.  As Robert Towne noted in an interview about the film, a major element of ""Chinatown"" is the shocking realization on the part of Nicholson, who had formerly worked as a police officer assigned to Chinatown, that John Huston as Noah Cross is a man who will do anything to get what he wants, and is more ruthless than anyone he ever encountered.  When an exasperated Gittes asks Cross at one point what he can possibly gain through a big land payoff predicated on accessibility to water, noting that he could buy anything he wanted presently, Cross answers, ""The future, Mr. Gittes, the future.""Towne shrewdly used a historical controversy from Los Angeles history, the career of William Mulholland and the tragedy of the Van Norman Dam.  History was juxtaposed and the controversy was moved from the first decade of the twentieth century to 1937.  It made good sense cinematically since the city was so much more developed by that time.Another integral element of the film is Nicholson's developing romantic relationship with Faye Dunaway as Evelyn Mulwray, widow of the slain water chief and daughter of Noah Cross.  Gittes'  romantic progress is slowed by the manner in which he holds Evelyn, an erudite, sophisticated woman in awe, someone removed from his own rough and tumble middle class world.  He ultimately learns that the daughter toward whom Evelyn is so protective was sired by none other than Noah Cross.In addition to adroitly directing the film, maintaining a consistently brisk pace, Roman Polanski also had a small but key acting role.  Playing one of Cross' thugs, he tells Gittes, ""You've got a big nose, kitty cat.""  To prove his point, while another Cross hoodlum, a crooked ex-sheriff, holds Gittes, Polanski snips off part of the detective's nose with a knife.",N/A
406536,"&quot;Stealing Beauty&quot; could be considered a breakthrough for both Liv Tyler and Rachel Weisz. Not only it helped Tyler shake off her failure in previous films (&quot;Heavy&quot; and &quot;Silent Fall&quot;), it gave her and Weisz a good leverage to box office hits thereafter (like &quot;The Mummy&quot; and &quot;Lord of the Rings&quot;). So Bernardo Bertolucci deserved all the credit here. In fact, the cast and cinematography were quite enjoyable. However, when it came to  Bertolucci's portrayal of life through the eyes of artists (and people connected with them in one way or another), I couldn't help thinking of Federico Fellini. I believe Bertolucci is almost as good as Fellini, just one small step short.

594115,Considering how much I really despise Beyonces group Destinys Child I kept my expectations for this movie relatively low. I was so sick and tired of hearing that strongly annoying voice on the radio and people shoving that DC krap in my face.However my expectations were completely blown away and Goldmember turned out to be my favorite of the Austin Powers saga.The jokes that dominated the first two flicks are continued in the third installment of the bunch. Austin Powers is one a mission to stop a crazed man from using a magnetic beam to cause an giant asteroid to collide with earth. Plus Austin has to rescue his long lost father by the name of Nigel Powers.My favorite part was where Austin Powers met Britney Spears in the awful Boyz video when it turns out that the Britney in the movie was actually a fembot. I literally laughed when I saw the fembot blow up.While the female charachter Foxy Cleopatra did get on my nerves at the beginning I must say she turned out much better than I thought.

Maybe there's some truth on the werewolf legends after all.....This is a typical ""a group of people gather in a strange place and get killed one after the other while they try to figure out what's happening""-movie, and like many movies of its kind, it suffers from lack of any real plot, and has too many characters that you never really get to know. Especially in the beginning there are a number of scenes with lots of unimportant dialogue. The acting is like in most b-grade horror movies not very good.This movie is better than ""Howling III"", but not good as ""The Howling"" or ""Howling IV"" and not as funny as ""Howling II"". It's just another b-horror movie with nothing that will make you remember it. But if you've watched the four previous Howling-movies you might just as well watch this one as well.",N/A
48101,"Unlike ""The Right Stuff,"" the brilliant film on the Mercury space program that focuses more on character profiles and symbolism than factual history, ""Apollo 13"" is an entertaining space film that can be used by high school and junior high history teachers. This is due to director Ron Howard and his crew's painstaking recreation of the Apollo space program -- from using a weightless environment to borrowing large chunks of mission control transcripts. The recreations are so dead-on that astronauts and mission control members report having forgotten they were on a set, or confusing the digital imitations for the real thing.Where Howard's dazzling special effects and technical accuracy leave off, his cast takes over. Tom Hanks' enthusiasm for the subject matter shows as Commander Jim Lovell. He skillfully portrays both the excitement of going into space and the stoicism with which the astronauts approached their dangerous work. Bill Paxton as Lunar Module Pilot Fred Haise, Kevin Bacon as Command Module Pilot Jack Swigert and Kathleen Quinlan as Lovell's wife Marilyn also shine, but it is masters of subtlety Ed Harris as flight director Gene Kranz and Gary Sinise as grounded astronaut Ken Mattingly who steal every scene. They are given ample opportunity to do so, thanks to the wise decision to focus as much on the heroism on the ground from geeks with pocket protectors as the heroism in space from the astronauts.The only problem is the film's occasional ham-handedness, most noticably in its attempts to place the mission in a historical context. Where Hanks, Howard and producer Brian Grazer's miniseries ""From the Earth to the Moon"" (in the segment ""1968"") deftly underscored the turbulence of the late 1960s and early 1970s, this film makes offhand references through the eldest Lovell daughter to the Hippie Movement and the Beatles breaking up, which comes off as crass and afterthought-like.Still, the film is alternately suspenseful and meticulous in most of the right places, and is therefore valuable both as a movie and as a historical record.The DVD was made when studios were only beginning to play with the medium, and while the ""Apollo 13"" DVD was an early groundbreaker, the awkwardness shows. An hour-long documentary and two commentary tracks -- one from Howard, one from the real-life Jim and Marilyn Lovell -- together provide a glimpse into both the historical facts and the filmmaking tricks (although screenwriters William Broyles, Jr. and Al Reinert are entirely ignored). But the extras mostly stop there. There is a trailer and production and cast and crew notes, and the menu is a CD for the film score soundtrack, albeit a CD which cannot be paused and in which you can skip FORWARD but not BACKWARDS. Yet the DVD is a far cry from the Special Editions of today. There are no NASA documentaries, for instance, and very little original documentary footage.While it seems possible, perhaps likely, that Universal could eventually release an even more loaded DVD release, the current one is more than adequate for educational and entertainment purposes.",N/A

ADV has also put together an impressive package here, featuring 3 DVD's for less than the price of two of the VHS editions, removeable subtitles, chapter selections, and some of the most creative and effective cover art ever brought to a Japanese SciFi film release.

475860,"Already over 2,000 reviews on this thing so far.  That's amazing, but even more amazing was how uninspiring this film was.  The city planet was a strange place, and it reminded of all the trips to Boston on Rte 128 or Rte 495.  I can't imagine a planet that reminds me of New York City.  That was a truly disturbing vision.  Then there were the Jedi's.  Not too inspiring, either.  The villains were preposterous, as was the alleged UN of the planets.  Just the same kind of stuff as in the year 2002.  Boring, boring, and politically boring.  Ja-Ja Binks was the real winner, here, and I'm not getting into the racist dialogue.  He had nothing to do with being a Jamaican, no matter what anyone says.  He was a unique character, and his city under the sea was truly inspiring.  The rest of the movie was a set-up for the next.

Secondly, this profound and powerful film brings tears to my eyes even now, weeks later.  I've heard people link it to To Kill a Mockingbird and Forrest Gump, but I don't believe it needs to ride the coattails of anything--it's strong on its own.  This movie is ultimately about sacrifice, but it holds its own on all kinds of subjects, ranging from the treatment of criminally insane to domestic violence to child abuse.  John Ritter beautifully brings to life a warm, loving, stable gay character, and that, in my book, only adds to the film's far-reaching appeal.  The surprise performance:  Dwight Yoakam's portrayal of the drunken, abusive Doyle.  This film is perfection.",N/A
520206,"Every dime they've spent on this trilogy is on the screen. Whether it's set design, costumes, make-up or digital wizardry - even the acting - they've gotten the biggest possible bang for every buck. The movie is a continuous visual feast from beginning to end. It's just that by the time the last course comes out, you've been sitting back from the table with your hands folded across your chest for almost an hour. And, since the final installment won't be out until Christmas 2003, you know there won't be a dessert.The creators' devotion to the events in the source material is admirable but also a limitation. Tolkien often substituted internal back-story and characterization for plot development and this is glaringly evident on film. The plot breaks down into a three hour chase sequence that feels uncomfortably repetitive.If you don't know where the first book ends, you'll be treated to a least a half dozen false endings that utilize every visual and musical cue to indicate the credits are about to roll...then cut to more dialogue. Every third person in the theater looked at their watch when this happened. I didn't realize so many folks had day-glow watches these days.I am not saying the movie is a waste of time. The elements that make the Rings trilogy great - Tolkien's imagination and love of detail and his depiction of the individual's potential for good and evil - are evident. But there have been so many movies inspired by his work that - unfortunately - it takes the luster off the master's story when it finally sees its moment in the sun.",The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring
727118,"Reese Witherspoon shines, surrounded by strong supporting characters like Mary Kay Place (of the TV series, Mary Hartman, Mary Hartman, popular some 20 years ago), and a shrewd, witchy Candice Bergen. ""Sweet Home Alabama"" is made according to the old-fashioned formula of romance, dilemma, and symmetry. The film begins and ends at the same place, the beach on the Gulf Coast in a severe electrical storm.My sole criticism is that some of the outfits that Witherspoon wears in the film belie her successful career as a New York fashion designer.Her two love interests, her Alabama high school sweetheart who stocks his refrigerator with non-lite Bud, and her New York fiance who stages his marriage proposal in an after-hours opening of Tiffany's jewelry department, could not be further apart, geographically and otherwise.This good-natured film will evoke nostalgia for the well-made stories of the 1940s.

317055,"This is a great Bond movie.  You could tell it was written for Connery, right before his departure from the series.  It's very suspenseful, and has a great premise, and a great villain in Christopher Lee.  However, about an hour an a half into the movie, there's one glaring fault that always bothers me: as Bond jumps his car over a river in an amazing stunt during a chase sequence, the filmmakers added the sound effect of a child's whislte; the whistle is the first note in the dumbing-down of Bond we suffered in the 70s.  It announces to us the series is about to get very silly.  Had Connery been in this one, it would have been one of the best of the entire series.",N/A
462889,"'Insomnia' announces itself as yet another 'Se7en' clone, with its brutal opening murder, as lovingly detailed and dehumanised in its execution as Kevin Spacey's handcraft at the beginning of Fincher's film; and in its nervy, scratchy credits sequence.  But, while it only became apparent near the end that 'Se7en' was really about the detectives rather than the killer, this film is a relentless study of a morally void cop.  In his first scene, we see Jonas scribbling over the victim's face; and a blunder in the early stages of the investigation finds him covering up the truth about the murder, rather than trying to reveal it, leading to an unholy pact with the killer.This perversion of the detective's traditional role is visualised in two related ways.  Firstly, the enlightenment the detective should bring, but here suppresses, is displaced onto the 24-hour bleaching sunlight of the Northern Norwegian coastal town in which the film is set.  A Swede in a hostile environment, and already guilty of abusing his position with sexual misdemeanours, Jonas tries to block out this light which prevents him from sleeping.  Lack of sleep begins to effect not only his morality, but his judgement - he gropes a teenage witness; he spies on her making love to the young sap he is going to frame; he nearly rapes the hotel receptionist he lusts after.  The film's rhythms and visuals take on the character of this psychological breakdown - the pace decelerates, becomes bleary and dream-like; the narrative fragments, heightened by the hallucinatory and visionary; the clinical white that seeps the frame blocks out all depth and perspective, leaving everything flat and on the surface.  Allied to this sun, which is too bright to shed any light, is the dusky, enveloping fog, wastes of garbage and delapidated buildings with their subterranean passages destroying any chance of truth and resolution emerging.It is a tribute to Stellan Skarsgard's brave, controlled performance as a nasty, gutless, uncontrolled psychotic, that it is at all possible to watch this unpleasant but compelling film to the end.",N/A

500302,"First let me say that Stanley Kubrick is one of my favorite filmmakers. Only Hitchcock, Welles, David Fincher and a few others can compare with him. But that doesn't mean that every movie he made was great (anyone see Eyes Wide Shut?). Barry Lyndon is not a great movie. It's a period piece, and it seems well researched. The costumes are great. The sets are magnificant. And the photography is beautiful. I heard somewhere that it was like watching a painting move. And that is pretty accurate. Kubrick paid very close attention to detail, and it is a very beautiful picture to watch. The problem is that the characters are one dimensional, Lord Bullingdon being the one exception. The acting is wooden. The story moves at such a slow pace. The movie feels like it goes on for hours and hours. It's hard to believe that the same guy who made A Clockwork Orange and Full Metal Jacket is the same filmmaker who made this movie. It's just plain boring. If you are a serious film student or a hard core fan of Kubrick, I'd say watch it once, just so you can say you did. Otherwise, rewatch A Clockwork Orange.",Barry Lyndon VHS

I bought this DVD because Hugh Jackman is utterly charming, charismatic and WOW is he easy on the eyes. I could watch this man read the phone book and it would probably be more entertaining and original than this movie's storyline. Meg Ryan who usually can act, decided not too for this movie. I wish that somebody would have informed Ms. Ryan that her hair looked like it was styled a la weedwacker in this movie(it was very distracting)! Don't get me wrong I usually love Meg in romantic comedies and I love Hugh in anything. The whole cast are good actors, but the script was just average, no new twists or surprises added to make this movie different from any other romantic comedy. How the time travel took place was different but highly questionable, like after jumping off the bridge how do they land in the other time era, on their feet with no impact or in the river, How does Stuart know that when Leopold goes back that he will be repeating the whole day over of when he left, and when Meg's character goes back why does she arrive later that day and just in time? I know that it is just a romantic comedy but....don't introduce and then not explain it.Oh, well. If you want to watch an extremely handsome man then this is the movie.

190254,"Okay, it's another homobittersweetsexual movie.  This one is set in a garish place called Hollywood, if you choose to believe a place populated by such shallow people really exists.  It's also a delightful trifle.Had I written this review shortly after receiving the DVD I would have gone on gushily about how great it is, but it hasn't worn that well with repeated viewings.  The slender thread - should I say tease - upon which the plot hangs, ""is he or isn't he,"" ""will he or won't he,"" hasn't sustained my interest that much on subsequent viewings.Still, it's a fun movie.Sean Hayes is wonderful in this endearing role he created before becoming a stereotypical queen on ""Will and Grace.""  The other characters are not as well drawn and mostly too true to simplistic stereotypes but are entertaining.  Brad Rowe plays the somewhat naive but just-a-little-bit curious hunk well.  It isn't a role that I'm very sympathetic to.  I realize he was supposed to be more wooden and less graceful than Billy, and a bit of a tease and a bit of a jerk, but I kept wondering if he was chosen just for his Brad Pitt looks.I am not a fan of drag or musicals, but the fantasy sequences were a real hoot, particularly the dance number with Billy and Gabriel and the Petula Clark numbers.  Besides Hayes acting, these are the best parts of the film.Director Tommy O'Haver has a few cute cinematic tricks up his sleeve.  The use of the Polaroid as integral to the story was fine, but he was overly fond of it's use as a cinematic device.  I found the opening sequence and ""groovy"" credits tedious the first time thru and even more so on subsequent viewings.  When a film starts out by playing down to the audience and talking down to the audience, it's usually not a good sign, but fortunately the rest of the film treats the audience more intelligently.The Polaroid device is also unfortunately used to present the tedious flashback of Billy's coming out, which I suppose is actually somewhat autobiographical of the director.  I suppose everybody thinks their coming out story is absolutely fascinating, but in truth they seldom are to anybody other than the teller.  Anyway, its preferable in a movie to show a prior coming out experience, if it's essential to the story, rather than just have a character narrate a slide show.  Billy's character is already the only well developed character in the film and this extra insight isn't necessary to the plot.Besides the tiresome overuse of the Polaroid as a cinematic device, the scene in which Billy gets some quality PosturePedic time with Gabriel and starts acting like a rabbit in a lettuce patch was a bit heavy for a trifle like this.  I was grateful Gabriel quickly put a stop to it.One of the best parts of the DVD is the track of director's comments; don't miss it.  There is a lot to the film that doesn't catch the eye of a casual viewer and I hope Mr. O'Haver has the opportunity to make more films, so long as he loses the Polaroid next time around.",N/A
532787,"Some critics have complained that the storyline in Vertical Limit is silly. I think they miss the point. This is a thriller, pure and simple, and on that level it is excellent. I think it must be quite difficult to make a movie that both pumps up the audience's adrenaline and tells a meaningful story that makes perfect sense. A few years ago I decided that this kind of picture succeeded if the action didn't totally defy logic, if the excitement was sustained and, if the plot was easy to follow. Vertical Limit easily meets these requirements. So what if the story is banal and absurd? So was Twister's. Such films serve the same purpose as thrill rides, and that purpose has nothing to do with education or enlightenment.The movie opens with a terrifying sequence. Peter [Chris O'Donnell] and his sister, Annie [Robin Tunney], are rock climbing with their Dad. Suddenly, some novice climbers above them fall. In the ensuing melee, the father is killed. Annie blames Peter. Four years later, the siblings are still cool towards each other. Peter has given up climbing and become a nature photographer, but Annie has become a professional mountaineer. Peter runs into her in Pakistan where Annie is working for Elliot Vaughn [Bill Paxton], a billionaire who is obsessed with climbing K-2, the highest mountain in the world. The expedition turns into a disaster when an avalanche sweeps Elliot, Annie and another climber into a cave, where they are trapped. Peter assembles a rescue team, which must endure wind, cold, icy precipices and more avalanches. They take along some nitroglycerine, which proves to be unstable and adds even more danger. If they don't hurry, the stranded trio will die, partly because the oxygen is very thin at 26,000 feet.Admittedly, the plot itself gets very thin at times. For example, why would they take nitroglycerin into an area where avalanches are your worst nightmare? Because this is an action-adventure movie, and such fare demands explosions. To me, the plot holes are inconsequential. Like Jaws, Twister, Independence Day and Armageddon, the story is just on outline to build the action on.It occurred to me while watching Vertical Limit that a viewer's involvement in a thriller increases when the subject matter involves things he or she is fearful of. There are three elements in the movie I find the thought of dreadful. Often when I am out in the cold, I wonder what would happen if I couldn't find a warm place. In certain situations, I think there is not enough air to breath. I don't have a fear of heights, but, oddly, I do have a great fear of falling. Vertical Limit takes place in zero degree weather on an icy, slippery mountain, so naturally I found it to be both frightening and fascinating. As thrillers went in the year 2000, this flick was at the top of the heap. Or the mountain.",N/A

I guess I feel that if the movie doesn't have to make sense, its review doesn't either. ;)This movie is a black hole of hopelessness. Everything is so drawn out and there seems to be no real point to anything...which is the way life seems at times. No solid plot, unexplained characters and events(?), dirty, dingy surroundings..I would say that Gummo is an important film because it answers no questions but raises many... Are there really people who live this way? Has anyone ever escaped this town/fate? Do I ever come across that way? Is it ok to be like that? What do I think about people like this, and does that make me a bad person? In other words, it forces you to examine yourself and the way you view others.Also, on the grander side, it asks what qualifies as a legitimate film? When does a movie become something other than art?Gummo is definately more than art, because it captures very difficult sensations from real life and unapologetically subjects the viewer to them.In conclusion, I would not recommend this movie to those who have a problem with unflinching ugliness, disorienting situations, and sincere self-examination.",N/A

(Storyline?)Movie traces the lives of Frida Kahlo and Diego Rivera from the time the schoolgirl and friends first ogle him and his model when he comes to town, to their marriage, their divorce, their re-marriage and...it's frankly hard to tell what happens at the end, but I assumed Sra. Kahlo was near death.Be warned, there is a lot of sex and nudity. There is also a lot of blood, and a particularly graphic scene involving an embryo. Those familiar with the career of Kahlo will not be surprised at this. Those unfamiliar may wince at all of this.On the plus side, there are some really cool visual effects involving some puppetry and other low-tech graphics, as you might expect from The Lion King's Julie Taymor. Pay close attention to the paintings in the movie.All in all, I personally found a visually beautiful movie which dangerously smelled of lacking a plot. Point-of-view changes constantly from narration to observation. If the unsuspecting moviegoers keep the kids at home, turn their heads during the grosser parts, and do not expect a strict biopic, I think they may find it, at the very least, interesting. It's not a feel-good movie by any stretch, but it's not totally pessimistic, either. In fact, I found myself not knowing what exactly to feel by the end of it.",Frida

Actually, this movie breaks new ground on a number of fronts, one of which is to involve the cameraperson in the movie.  And so if the camera is off center or sideways or shaking or even dropped, you can tell how the cameraperson is feeling and since this is a horror movie, the point is to show how very very scared everyone is, especially the person who is holding the camera.Another effective aspect of the movie besides the way it was shot is the way it was cast.  The characters/victims are not professional actors/actresses giving canned responses.  They are again amateurs, and the way in which they talk and act in the movie is very realistic.  The audience can identify with them.Finally, the situation that arises in this movie, that of losing the map and getting lost in the woods, is a situation which almost anyone can relate to.  Even if you haven't actually gotten lost before, the fear or the momentary nudge that maybe you don't know where you're going, or that you can't trust the person who is leading the way or who is entrusted with the map is certainly a psychological dynamic which we are no doubt familiar with.And then there are those sounds and shadows in the middle of the night in the woods when you are camping out, which you can't quite identify but which look or sound eerily reminscent of something which you have seen or heard before . . . .",Curse of the Blair Witch VHS

The movie takes off like a rocket and the action doesn't stop 'til the end - and that's when you suddenly realize the ride is almost over and you start wishing for more.

86389,"Let's get one thing straight, the Kubrick film is not, repeat, is not the book. It is a re-invention of the theme under the same title. That being said, let's cut the whining about how different it is from the book and try to judge the film on its own merits.The movie held my attention from start to finish, and geuniunely scared me at parts. Much has been made of the characters, so let's review them. First, there is Jack, a man who was apparently never very stable and, once placed in relative isolation in a haunted hotel, goes completely crazy. This is consistent with the character's history as explained in the film. His &quot;recovery&quot; after breaking his son's arm was apparently only a thin shell that he developed to hide his abberation. As a side note, this is consistent with the Jack in the book, who never sought outside help to help him control his drinking (unlike the miniseries, the first 20 minutes or so of which seemed like Jack doing a commercial for AA). In this film (and in the book) Jack's erratic nature was invisible to his family because they loved him blindly. Shelly Duval's character appears to be just the kind of person who could love a person so blindly, so she gets five stars too.Danny's performance in the movie is also widely criticized as over the top, especially with regards to the &quot;redrum&quot; sequence. Let's not forget, however, that he is a child and something unworldly is happening to him. What do you expect, calm acceptance of his situation? I doubt that even an adult could manage that in his situation. Furthermore, the Tony in the film was largely unseen, like the Tony in the book, which enhanced the effect of &quot;his&quot; role greatly. This is in contrast to the Tony of the miniseries, who hovered above Danny and preached like some cheesy b-movie angel.A lot is made about the elements of the book that were excluded. The things that were lost, however, really made little difference to the plot. The hornet's nest sequence served only to highlight Jack's inadequacy as an exterminator  The topiaries were not missed as they were probably the silliest part of the book (when I read that part remember thinking &quot;what is this, 'Day of the Triffids' all of a sudden?&quot;). The hedge maze was a place of fun turned into a trap that required paradoxial thinking (i.e. walking backwards) to foil. This was consistent with the tone of the movie and enhanced it greatly.Again., I urge viewers to watch this movie with an open mind. Don't criticize it just because it is different from the book. Instead, try to appreciate the creepy atmosphere, shockig visuals and excellent performances.",N/A
27515,"Although this movie does have some intriguing points and does a good job of bringing up age old scepticism,it inadequatly depicts Christianity by demonizing religon and lionizing the proud and rebelious.Mimi Rogers who plays Sharon does a few things that make me wonder why so many people would feel sorry for her.First of all(and I blame this largely on Hollywood)when Sharon decides to turn a new leaf and try to better herself AKA not sleeping around in promiscuous group sex,she instantly goes to a 180 extreme by rigid rules and preaching to others instead of knowing God,loving God,treating herself and others with reaspect and trying to lead a decent life.Hollywood always makes this statement that you're either extremely pious or you indulge in every kind of sin;no inbetween,how unoriginal and closeminded.Secondly,she kills her daughter one day before the rapture not because God told her to,but because of her own lack of faith.All she had to do was wait ONE DAY!That in itself shows her selfishness and how shallow her soul is.Lastly,near the end of the movie,when she is sooo angry with God(why I don't know,God did not order her to kill her daughter)she has the chance to be reunited with her daughter in Heaven if she would just accept God and His commandments.Naturally being the idiot that she is,she refuses.If any human is that proud and that self-absorbed then they don't deserve to be in Paradise.I really like Mimi Rogers,but this script was so sterotypical and biased that it would turn away anyone who was considering a religous life.",Rapture VHS
37521,"With any sequel it's difficult to have high hopes of it surpassing the original.  This rudimentary slasher flick offers nothing new, but it's difficult to say that it's a bad movie.  The story has Jesse (Patton) move in with his family to the house where Nancy from the first movie lived and watched her boyfriend get murdered across the street.  Soon he realises that his sickening nightmares are actually a manifestation of the very thing Nancy was trying to get away from - Freddy Krueger, a deformed monster who possesses Jesse in order to reak bloody havoc.  Caught up in the mess is occassional love interest Lisa (Myers).There's clearly plenty to pick out of the plot, in particular some cheesy acting and plenty of obvious turning points.  However, the gore is laid on thick, with some impressive special effects, especially for a movie made in the 80's.  There's a handful of pretty enjoyable scenes as Freddy rips his way through the pool party of a bunch of obnoxious teens.  The movie is also peppered with gay undertones, although the movie never really tells us why.  In addition, the split-personality of Jesse is never quite exploited for all its worth.  Still, there's a bizarre and appropriately surreal dream sequence at the beginning, and even if this will never truly scare it's still entertaining enough.",N/A

256210,"The Karate Kid trilogy despicably ends with one of the most pathetic movies ever produced, &quot;Karate Kid 3,&quot; which was SO stupid, in fact, that it was funny.Years after Daniel-sahn has returned home from Japan, he has yet a NEW girlfriend, and resides with Miyagi somewhere in the U.S.A.  Daniel-sahn is overweight and looking at him walk and talk, one would never guess that he even ever SAW a karate move in his entire life, much less PRACTICED one.  He looks like a chubby nerd who probably couldn't defend himself against a scrappy chihuahua puppy, let alone an adept karateka.In this flic, Daniel-sahn is coerced in numerous ways to begin training for a karate tournament that neither he nor Miyagi have any desire in entering.  Miyagi, in fact, initially refuses to train him and tells Daniel-sahn that he's on his own.  In comes Daniel's deus ex machina: One of the &quot;bad guys&quot; deceives Daniel into believing that he's a good guy that wants to train Daniel-sahn.  And he trains him by having Daniel hitting wooden boards so hard that they bludgeon his fists!  This aggressive training leads Daniel-sahn to break someone's nose, and finally the idiot gets a clue and realizes that he's been set up all along.Finally, Miyagi comes into the picture and gets Daniel back into true form in time for the tournament where Daniel faces an opponent who is clearly much more confident and aggresive than Macchio.  The tactic of Macchio's opponent -in typical, predictable fashion- is to injure Daniel-sahn as severely as possible, scoring illegal hits, then score a legal hit to win.  In typical fashion, Daniel-sahn pulls himself together and wins the last point and the movie ends.This is definitely a movie that should be submitted to Mystery Science Theater for review.  Don't get me wrong; there's plenty of comedy, but the only problem is that the producers of the movie didn't INTEND this flic to be a comedy.  Purchase this movie only if you enjoy comedies, but don't expect any of the drama and interesting plot found in the previous two Karate Kids.",The Karate Kid Part III VHS

274940,"I realize that I am in the minority here, but I have never much cared for the movie 2001. Granted there are some breathtaking picturesque scenes and the score is one cinema's great masterpieces, not to mention the grand special effects (tame by today's standards, but that was in 1968). However, the movie dragged on forever and the plot was paper thin. There was a great deal in the movie that made no sense whatsoever. 2001 was like trying to eat plastic food; it looks really nice, but it serves no function except decoration.Happily 2010 is not like that. The movie is very much plot driven (as movies should be) and is far more enjoyable to watch than it's predecessor. Roy Scheider is always a joy to watch and it's interesting to see John Lithgow in a ""regular Joe"" role instead of the quirky parts he usually plays. The movie not only has a decent plot of it's own, but it answers many of the questions that 2001 left unanswered: What happened to Dave Bowman; why did HAL go berserk; what are those monoliths near Jupiter doing.The film never reaches the artistic achievements of 2001.

Redford's metamorphosis as he moves from the hunter to the hunted is just amazing and the scene with Geer at the end of the film is one of the most poignant in movie history. Can't understand why they made Redford enunciate his words so clearly like nobody else around spoke English?The DVD transfer is outstanding and the sountrack is one of the best Hollywood ever produced.

704163,"Be prepared for a startingly novel view on this old warhorse.  McVicar's production for London's Royal Opera brings out unabashedly all of the libretto's sexual tensions, usually only hinted at in traditional productions, stunningly laid out and planted before the viewer's very eyes throughout the whole work which characterises the production's conception. In purely vocal terms the very accomplished cast is led by the immaculate Gilda of Christine Sch&auml;fer (yes, the same one you encountered ""singing"" Pierrot Lunaire exemplarily for Pierre Boulez on a DG cd, of all people), prudently set apart by McVicar as apparently the only sane person in the whole lot of characters in spite of her falling for ""Gualtier Mald&eacute;"". The Argentinian Marcelo &Aacute;lvarez is an outstanding Duke, cynical, libidinous and unhinbited as perhaps any other recent exponent of the rle, his physical presence no doubt visually supporting this. Gavanelli is a Rigoletto vocally in the grand Italian tradition, right in timbre in spite of some occasional rapid vibrato but exemplary in his diction, a rather deranged character in McVicar's view who walks about the stage in crotches; one quickly sees why he's rightly sought after by the world's leading opera houses for this rle. The other important parts, those of Sparafucile and Gilda, are also very well cast, especially the latter who must be one of the horniest Gildas on record. Visually, the production subscribes to current visions on the ways of people of wealth of four or five centuries ago: exquisite fabrics enrobing people who appear not to have visited a bathtub for many months (gone seem to be the days in which period plays, operas and movies showed immaculate participants). Sir Edward Downes' conducting with swift, vigorous tempi provokes inspired playing from the ROH's Orchestra and the sound really justifies your connecting your player to a quality sound system if you still haven't done so: it has to be heard to be believed. D&eacute;cors & staging take full advantage of the ROH's recent refurbishing, Rigoletto's and Spafucile's respective dwellings depicting a timeless and appropriate shantiness of tin roofing and carton walling that recall today's third-world capitals' misery belts. Camerawork is very good, and curiously the BBC take great pains in making you believe this was taped live by inserting applause at the ""right"" places (like after arias and ensembles or at Sir Edward's entrances to the pit at the beginning of acts); only when this applause tends to sound the same one time after the other you begin to suspect and your suspicions confirm at the end --or at least so seemed in my case-- when applause de-synchonises with what's actually happening on stage when curtain calls are taking place once the work has finished, but this is only a minor quibble. And for a change, and this is a big plus, this opera dvd does bring extra material, with a plot lecture and an enlightening interview with the producer. If you are one of those who don't make totems out of the big figures of old but are rather looking for a current, up-to-date version of Rigoletto, look no further. Mind, though, that the production is far from the ""good-to-introduce-the-kids-to-opera"" world.","Verdi - Rigoletto / Downes, Gavanelli, Schafer, Alvarez, Royal Opera House"

I could never put my finger on it but as I was watching Minority Report I never felt overly interested in the movie.  I tried to figure out why this beautifully made movie wasn't pulling me in but I couldn't, all I can say is that it was missing something that made it fall short of being one of the great movies.  I would definately recomend seing this movie, and I didn't feel cheated as I walked out of the theatre, but I did turn to my friend and say ""this is definately not a purchase (when it comes out on DVD)"".  I wasn't alone in this feeling of incompleteness.  My friends felt the same way and neither of them could put their finger on what it was either.  Also, the whole theatre full of people seemed to walk out in a daze as though they had just finished watching a documentry in history class, not as though they had just seen a great movie.  It seemed to me that everyone was impressed with the movie; it's original story, it's great special effects, but no one was overly impressed with the movie itself.

713781,"I always hated the original films because I thought they were REALLY stupid. Well, after watching part 3, I didn't watch any more until part 8, which my friend dragged me too. It [was bad], to put it mildly. Then Jason Goes to Hell came out and I went and saw it with another friend. It was a whole new studio, and I had been impressed with the coverage offered by Fangoria and had been looking forawrd to it. There was maybe 10 people at the show. It was great and I was in love with Jason as a character, although I had wished he was in it more. Now, many years later, Jason X comes on the scene. This time I went with my girlfriend. Again, there was about 10 people at the show. We all LOVED it! We all laughed at the right times, particularly the whole last half hour. This is a sci-fi comedy with horror added as spice, not as a central element. Anyway, we all thoroughly enjoyed it and everyone applauded at the end, it was fantastic! So why did this movie bomb? Well, frankly I don't know. I thought it was spoofing Hellraiser: Bloodlines and Leprachaun in Space, but I think some people took this film seriously. This film was never meant to be taken seriously. When one character says ""It's ok, he just wanted his machete back."", it's a joke people. That's not bad acting, that's not bad writing, it's a joke. A funny one at that.That being said, I do have some complaints. First, the editing. This film was completed and on the shelf for 2 years, why couldn't they fix the editing?... Also, the score just stinks. I believe I read somewhere that they hired the guy from the first one to also score this one. Why? Cheesy sythesizers [were bad]then and they [are] even worse now. My girlfriend maintains that they are spoofing those old scores, but I found it annoying. It wouldn't be so bad except the trailer was pumping with cool heavy metal music and it was certainly missed here. I also didn't like the Tomb Raider inspired robo-chick. She can't act, she didn't really further the plot and her wise-cracks got old real fast. I can overlook all of this though because this movie just rocks! The effects are great, but the real hero is the story that doesn't pull any punches and just GOES FOR IT! The film ends pitch perfect and sets up for a sequel, although that's pretty doubtful. So it looks like Jason X is the swan song of the series. There's a chance it could come back if Jason Vs. Freddy gets off the ground and is successful, but I'll believe it when I see it. Short of that, Jason X is a good bookend to the series, and shows off what all these films could have produced with a little more tweaking and more time to develop the scripts.

I believe that the movie was to show some insight to Dahmer's motives and they were somewhat successful on that (of course we'll never be able to completely understand). The most important thing was left out, the cannibalism.  Jeffrey Dahmer had bizzare murdering and raping rituals, but I believe peoples curiosity of this infamous man was the cannibalism.  The subject doesn't even get touched in the movie.  Aside from that, I thought the movie was very good.  Casting Jeremy Renner as Dahmer was a good call.  He's attractive in a understated way just as Dahmer was.  He potrays the quiet, mousy, friendly, and semi-normal personallity that Dahmer was said to have.  Some of the supporting actors weren't very good ones, but Artel Kayru (Rodney) was quite skillful in his preformance.

577485,"Contrary to many views, this is not similar to Usual Suspects. In the latter film, a man concocted a story based on information he was viewing the entire time of the police interrogation.  Here, while there is, similarly, an interrogation, the man being interrogated is not viewing anything at all. A more important difference has to do with the psychological basis for the events that unfold in the two different stories.Whether or not the suspect here is concocting a story should not be revealed for fear of spoiling the premise of this work--which is a real paradox.  Why?While the acting here is superior--especially Hugo Weaving in the role of the man under investigation--and the premise is gripping, ultimately the rationale for the events that unfold in the police station is shown to be too banal to support the powerful theme of the story.A critical difference between the two films is that The Usual Suspects involves a spectrum of shady characters in the criminal milieu, while The Interview focuses on just one.  This is important, because the opportunity for multi-layered interaction (among the criminal bunch) in Usual Suspects is present and handled very well.  Here, the interaction is strictly between the suspect and the police.  With that kind of restricted focus, there would have to be a much greater emphasis on the psychology of the two sides.  While that is true to some extent, because this film ultimately emphasizes procedural error, the entire psychological basis is trivialized--in essence, destroyed.The trivialization and virtual elimination of the psychological basis for the mental battle between the two sides itself makes the film much less than what it could and should have been.  This is really too bad, because there are some fascinating sequences.  The very last scene of the suspect alone could have been a great ending, if the focus on procedural error had been replaced by something more subtle.  As it is, this is a noble and failed effort.",The Interview

756323,"I can't believe this gem of a thriller isn't better known.Reclusive secondhand bookstore shopper Jenny Wright finds an obscure paperback original horror thriller, and loves it so much she hunts down the unknown author's only other title, ""I, Madman.""  Its story is about a psychotic surgeon scorned by the object of his affections, who, in order to please her with the perfect visage, novocains himself, cuts off his own face, and murders other people to steal their features and sew them onto himself.  But no sooner does Wright begin reading the story, than a bizarre, masked stalker begins following her around, enacting the story in real-life, killing her friends to steal their features and get closer to her.  The author of ""I, Madman,"" it seems, wasn't writing a thriller  -  he wrote his autobiography.This one's a beautifully produced low-budget winner, benefiting from solid performances, a good script, gripping suspense and just the right amount of graphic gore.  It even has a nice opening and closing surreal special effects sequence, used probably to help diminish the intensity of the film so viewers will be reminded that it's just a story, after all, and not have as many nightmares after watching as they might otherwise.Definitely not for the faint of heart or squeamish of stomach, but lovers of thrillers and horror flicks will be more than satisfied.","I, Madman"
200095,"""Going My Way"" is not exactly one of the most perfect of all movies ever made. And it's not the most deserving ""Best Picture"" winner of 1944 either. The reasons I make those statements are 1.) It's somewhat corny and simplistic, with a few subplots and scenes that do work but still could have been left out. And 2.) Many people, including myself, would name ""Double Indemnity"", ""Gaslight"", ""Laura"", ""Meet Me in St. Louis"" or ""Murder, My Sweet"" as more deserving winners. But awards aren't really the best way to judge a movie's greatness because it's a matter of personal opinion. And ""Going My Way"" is a really good movie, despite these flaws.The movie is a great star vehicle for Bing Crosby, who portrays a priest named Father O'Malley sent to help another church run by cranky old Father Fitzgibbon (Barry Fitzgerald). Fitzgibbon, who's run the church for 45 years (""46 in October""), is in debt problems with the savings and loans run by Ted Haines Sr. (Gene Lockhart). Fitzgibbon, at first, is not excited by his new assistant's unorthodox methods of practice, such as wearing a baseball uniform when his priest clothing gets wet. He also doesn't care much for O'Malley's liking of golf along with fellow priest Father Timothy (Frank McHugh), remarking that there is too much work to allow games. Fitzgibbon tries to go to the bishop to get O'Malley transferred. But after hearing good things about Father O'Malley and being patient, O'Malley starts to grow on him. Eventually, the old bat starts to lighten up until, by film's end, his church is out of debt and he claims to be ten years younger. He even starts playing golf and other games.Fitzgerald is very good in the role, being sensitive or strict when the time comes. The interaction that he and Crosby have is marvelous. I also love his leprechaunish voice, which is most likely because he comes from Ireland. He received Oscar nominations for both Best Actor and Best Supporting Actor, the only such incident in the academy's history, and deservedly won Supporting Actor.But Bing has several very good to great scenes, which were probably a major factor in his Best Actor win. His performances of the title song and, with the help of the choir, ""Swinging on a Star"" are upbeat and entertaining. I also enjoyed the scene where he gives advice to a troubled young girl named Carol James (Jean Heather) on how to be a better singer and she follows it (A wise move I might add).Now for the movie's problems. There are a couple scenes that could have been excised from the film at the cutting room. About half an hour through the film, after visiting the bishop, Fitzgibbon is talked into keeping O'Malley at the church. But then, he leaves the church at night only to return some hours later. What does this scene mean? I think it was meant to show Fitzgibbon is thinking about whether he wants to stay in charge, for when he returns he says its only temporarily. Also, after that scene, there is one between him and O'Malley that shows character development for Fitzgibbon in how he longs to see his mother, whom he hasn't meet in 45 years. Yet another scene that could have been taken out is when O'Malley watches a performance of ""Ava Maria"" at the Metropolitan by singer Genevieve Linden (Rise Stevens), an old friend of ""Chuck"" (The nickname used by his friends). Both the song and Steven's performance of it are great, but it doesn't do much except slow the pace. And her impressive singing isn't enough to sway a publisher into buy some of Chuck's songs.There are also a couple of subplots. First with Carol and Ted Haines Jr. (James Brown), son of the Savings and Loans manager. This plot shows how O'Malley's advice helped the two straighten out their lives. Ted Sr. visits his son to find out why he quit his job, and finds out it was for a reason relevant to the time. There is also a plot that has some punk kids, who are more of a nuisance than a threat, getting help from O'Malley by forming a choir. By the film's end, they are straightened out and like singing even more than baseball or, the worst of their crimes, hijacking poultry trucks.The movie has several touching moments, most notably the ending when Fitzgibbon receives a big surprise. The surprise was arranged by O'Malley whom, since he is being transferred out, did it as a farewell gift. I admit that I'm not one for crying, having been hardened by too many action movies (Plus I wasted a lot of tears of ""Titanic"" back when I was 10 years old). But my eyes were just a bit misty as the choir started ""Too-ra-Loo-ra-Loo-ra"". Maybe in a few years I will come back and find this to be even sadder. For now, I'll read more of mother's Harlequin romances.I found certain themes here to be similar to those covered in a later movie: ""It's a Wonderful Life"". O'Malley influences and helps out many people in the movie who wouldn't have been better off without him. The only difference is that O'Malley, unlike the later film's protagonist, already knows that he has done great things before the movie ends. At the end, he walks out of the church with no formal thanks. He doesn't need one because he's the kind of person who doesn't ask in return.With a fine supporting cast, great songs, many humorous and touching scenes, ""Going My Way"" is movie I'm glad I watched. It may not be the best Oscar winner, but it made me sigh in one respect: Though ""Double Indemnity"" is an excellent (One of my favorites), how many remakes, homages, and spoofs have been done of that compared to ""Going My Way""? I guess schmaltz doesn't sell.",Going My Way VHS

602196,"Some including myself didn't think  Brett Ratner (Rush Hour) was a suitable choice to direct Red Dragon when it was first announced. However he easily put all my doubts to rest after me viewing the film. Don't get me wrong Maichael Mann (Heat, The Insider) is a fine director but I think he had the wrong idea with Manhunter. Sure it was good but the whole look of the movie was wrong, plus he sorta made it too sexy. It's sorta like Hannibal Lector on an episode of Miami Vice or Nash Bridges. Ratner does so much more with a lot of the same material and took a lot more of a darker and scarier approach. Hell even Danny Elfman's score is much superior to the typicla 80's drama musical score in Manhunter. On the subject of Hannibal, Brian Coxx just wasn't menacing enough and doesn't have the over the top but fun presence that Hopkins does. I saw Red Dragon and then watched Manhunter and Coxx has a lot of the same dialogue that Hopkins has in Dragon but just says the lines with no energy. He even lacks the expressions of Hopkins and that insane look in his eyes. Coxx looked bored playing Hannibal but Hopkins you can just tell he loves  playing him.Edward Norton plays Will Graham, who William Peterson played in Manhunter and their couldn't of been a better choice. However I saw a review on tv where this women said Hopkins and Norton are the only reason to see Red Dragon and I disagree totally. Ralph Fiennes (Strange Days) and Emily Watson are excellent in supporting roles. Think they both should be nominated actually. The idea of a mad man who thinks he's hideous falling in love with a blind women who has no way of knowing the type of man she's with is ingenious. Dragon does so much more with those 2 characters than Manhunter did too. They both have a lot  more human emotion and character build up than in Manhunter too. Plus like I said Hopkins is back but as the Lector you loved in Silence of the Lambs and not the insane Martha Stewart one in Hannibal. The beginning he has a little fun cooking for guests but that scene is a lot less gross than the one in Hannibal. Well anyway I'd love to see Hopkins return for yet another serving as Hannibal, possibly this time Clarice and Graham could team up to catch him.",N/A

This has to be one of the funniest movies I've ever seen.  Every performance, from Witherspoon to Keifer Sutherland to Veronica Cartwright, is a tour-de-force.  Witherspoons plays Vanessa, a modern day Red Riding Hood on a journey to meet her long-lost grandmother, running away from the Child Services Department after her alcoholic, drug-addicted mother [Cartwright] is once again arrested for solicitation.  On her way, she encounters Sutherland, a child psychologist of dubious nature.  There's the ensuing hilarity, poignant moments and satisfying resolution.Why should you see this movie?  Because it's downright hysterical.  Reward yourself with a movie that you'll laugh through from start to finish and never skip through.",Freeway VHS

I was struck by Bertolucci's use of vivid color and texture throughout the film, and of how Kit's journey from beginning to end leaves her with an almost transcendant perspective on her own life and the world.  I am not sure if the old man in the cafe is played by the author Bowles himself, but it seems as though his presence is a kind of bookend effect; he sends his character out into the unknown and is there to receive her when her journey has ended.

661007,"CHOCOLAT lacks action and heavy drama. Also, outside of Judi Densch's best-supporting nominated performance, the acting isn't all that great. Johnny Depp shows up at the end of the film, but his appearance is more of a cameo than a performance.The movie itself isn't bad. The story has a good moral (tolerance) and the setting of a small 1950s French village is beautiful. However, the film isn't all that great; it's just average. The film's story is just another rehashed version of a water-downed Hollywood favorite: an outsider with liberal values moves to a small secluded place, the outsider is threatened, but in the end the outsider ""enlightens"" the people about their backward ways.Tolerance and forgiveness are essential in life. Jesus was all about forgiveness and Christians should be the most forgiving people. There are some Christians who aren't very tolerant or forgiving, but many are. Therefore, why are Christians almost always the bad guys in modern movies? Overall, CHOCOLAT looks tasty, but doesn't have much filling.",N/A

Or consider the synopsis of the plot - a family of dsyfunctional geniuses reconcile after decades of failure.  Open the package of this DVD and you will immediately notice the love in which the film was made, right down to the personable scetches created by the director's brother.Now imagine watching this movie and have all you're expectations met or exceeded.  That was my experience. This movie has become one of my all-time favorite films, something I've treasured and pondered long after I watched it.Nothing at all is ordinary in this film.  The presense of Angelia Huston gave me the impression of a modern-day Addams Family, most everything bizarre and fascinating like that family was.  The exiled head of the family, Royal Tenenbaum, attempts to reconcile with everyone by pulling a [quick one] on them.  Richard Tenenbaum falls in love with his sister and lives in a tent in the middle of his room.  Clas Tenenbaum is a childhood business mogol who is obsessed with safety after his wife dies, and thus dresses himself and his children in identical, bright-red jumpsuits.Each scene plays out like the characters - highly defined, quick witted and quick paced, backed with energy and emotion, and before you realized everything you saw, you're on to the next one.  The conflicts resolve in a satisfying yet never-predictable way - nothing you ever are hoping for happens, and yet everyone ends up happy.  The messages of redemption after failure are my favorite, and give this movie itself greatest weight.  To watch this family work through its incredible problems is a source of hope to even the most bitter person.",The Royal Tenenbaums

663700,"This is a failed attempt at a Stephen King-ish story. A straight-to-video rehash of other (and better) movies about a troubled writer and his troubled but devoted wife who move into a great big old scary house way out in the ""marsh"". They are both grieving the recent loss of their only child--a little boy--to a sudden freak death (he swallowed a wasp in his cereal!). The husband becomes surly and starts pounding out his new ""bestseller"" on the computer while the wife starts seeing things and getting supernatural ""messages"" that she only has so many days to live---5 then 4 then 3 and so on. The husband doesn't believe her and goes totally bonkers while the wife desperately tries to figure out whats going on. Then TA-DA! She finds out the property is built on a huge mass grave of murdered convicts! If any of this sounds familiar, the story borrows shamelessly from ""The Shining"" and ""Poltergeist""- even the ending with corpses coming up in the basement and the wife running around with a big butcher knife to get away from the crazed hubby is all too familiar. Only this go 'round, they both survive and write the bestseller that saves the husband's career: ""7 Days to Live"" based on their experiences! Hogwash.

521404,"How do you take the best selling comic book and turn it into something that everyone will enjoy?  Well you got yourself the best example ever in X-Men.First off we all know the story, mutants, Professor X, and Wolverine.  It's all good, the fan boys have bought this film to death.  So my review is geared towards the non-fan boys.  Because they should be the only ones that do not own this film yet.By the way fan boy = comic book lover.So heres the dealeo.  X-Men starts off by telling us the tragic story of how mutants and humans are having trouble coexisting, this burr is stuck between a certain senators unmentionables.  Thus creating stress between the two races.  In comes Magneto (picture villian with power to control magnetism)a mutant with a cause.  To kick all humans ....  Here enters Prof. X the good guy with mind powers and his X-Men (basically lots of mutants that help the fella out)  Plus we get treated to how these characters focus around two other mutants, Rogue and Wolverine who meet up in the Canadian outback.  The story then progesses along and well I won't tell you anymore, sorta ruins the whole movie watching process.The DVD in itself is awesome with really neat interactive menus and lots of goodies to keep one entertained for awhile.  But I think they should have at least added in mutant biographies to give non-comic fans an idea of who these characters are and describe them a bit better.  All in all though..it's still super well done.The story and movie is excellent as it has a lot of action scenes to keep everyone buckled in.  Plus the acting is a pure treat to watch.  The actors in this movie really made it work.  Just a great movie to sit down and watch.In closing, if your not a comic book fan and thinking ""eh is it really worth it?"" my answer yes it is, it is at least a must rent and a eventual must own.  Great watch and feast for the eyes, the special effects are great and nothing is done below the par level.  So go out and get this film people, what still reading this review?  Go! Shoo!By the way, fan boys not having this film yet (unless of course your anti marvel) you better go out and get it. Nuff' Said.Till next time true believers. Excelsior!",X-Men VHS
519958,"I really, really did not like this movie. Saying this when almost all the other reviews are well written explanations of why this movie deserves 5 stars is very difficult indeed. Nevertheless, after seeing this movie I felt very disappointed. I am a fan of both fantasy and science fiction, and I read and enjoyed (to some extend) one of the books in the Lord of the Rings series. So it is not that I just dislike fantasy/sci-fi.The reason I disliked this movie is that when I saw it in the theaters I almost fell asleep. There was no dramatic tension at all. Although I have to admit the opening sequences were very good, and the special effects and scenery were great - I would claim that the filmmakers got totally carried away with special effects. Once the hobbit and company started fighting computer generated monsters, I grew less and less interested until I was at the point of walking out of the theater! I mean, I have nothing against fighting in movies, especially fighting with well done special effects - but enough is enough! After a point there is no more excitement, and it becomes monotonous and dull.Honesty, the sad thing about movies today is that the reliance on special effects has led to a decline in the quality of the other aspects of the film, such as dialogue, creativity, etc, etc. In my opinion, there is nothing interesting in watching hours of computer generated fighting scenes. Come on - where is the excitement in that?In addition to the excessive fighting, I feel that this movie was badly acted. In one scene, there was a close up on the hobbit's face after somebody was killed (the fact that I don't remember who shows how much I really cared at that point) - and the whole theater began laughing out loud. I don't think that this was the desired effect, somehow.Anyhow, this is only my personal opinion. After viewing the movie, I felt that it was very bad due to the excessive fighting (and subsequent lack of creative dialogue, character development, etc, etc.) and poor acting. Hollywood really needs to go back to watching some classic movies - which did not use any special effects - because it seems that filmmakers have lost the ability to entertain audiences without massive doses of sepcial effects. And even worse, as proved by this movie, sometimes even special effects cannot make a dull movie interesting...",The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring

The fact that the record stood all these years with an asterix behind it, was unfair to Maris because his accomplishment was astounding and took many years to be matched.Billy Crystal brought the story forward to when Maris's record was broken, with actual footage of the Maris family.

The film portrays him as a conquistador-turned-healer.  The church--which even now pushes to make Junipero Serra, religious conquerer of California, a saint, having learned nothing about the damage done by the colonizer mentality--considers him a great patron of Christianizing the heathen Natives.  Some of the advocates of Native rights, voice, and history condemn him as a well-intentioned point man for the subsequent Spanish, and then Anglo, waves of conquest surging into Norteamerica.Whomever he was (and do e-mail me if you know much about him, because I'm curious), I like to think that the Seven Cities of Gold were metaphysical experiences not to be taken so literally.

Also included are the great comedic episode, ""Out of Their Minds,"" and the dramatic ""My Three Crichtons."" In terms of quality, this is the best out of the second season sets so far, since every episode is a gem.""Out of Their Minds"" takes an old sci-fi chestnut (the main characters all switch bodies), and completely turns it on its head in typical ""Farscape"" fashion. This episode is fun, fun, fun in the same vein as ""Crackers Don't Matter,"" (although not as dark) and ""Through the Looking Glass"" (although not quite as wack-a-do). A true classic.""My Three Crichtons"" takes another classic sci-fi cliche, in that John is split into three versions of himself. The twist, though, is that one is at the bottom of the evolutionary scale, a caveman early-man prototype, the second is the regular human him, and the third is a John Crichton of the future, further evolved than the average human, with a large skull, to hold his much-bigger brain. This episode, despite its jokey title, is a dark, involving hour.And then the crown jewel of the set...The entire ""Look at the Princess"" trilogy, composed of Part 1, ""A Kiss is But a Kiss,"" Part 2, ""I Do, I Think,"" and Part 3, ""The Maltese Crichton.""

Rex Harrison was an absolutely perfect Professor Higgins and never wavered or changed character.  My problem (a minor one) is with the ending and with the dubbing.The story is brilliant of course, taken from George Bernard Shaw's acclaimed play Pygmalion, although materially altered to fit the requirements of a musical comedy.  The contrast of the unschooled street urchin Liza Doolittle and the stuffy, self-possessed confirmed bachelor, a kind of nineteenth century British man of science, wonderfully accomplished in his profession, but blind to himself when it comes to relationships with other people, made for a most interesting match.  And the delusive dream of a man forming his own perfect woman (which is the basis of the Pygmalion legend) works so very well with a conceited linguist tutoring a cockney girl.  The entire concept is a work of genius with the drunken father and the objectifying Col. Pickering and the very right Mrs. Pierce.But there are some problems.  Freddy is needed of course as another &quot;objectifying&quot; character to make it clear just how desirable Eliza really is and how foolish and blind Professor Higgins is in not seeing this--in theory, of course, because in practice with Audrey Hepburn or Julie Andrews as Eliza, this would seem entirely unnecessary.  And indeed without Freddy we do not have the beautiful &quot;On the Street Where You Live.&quot;  But even with him Prof. Higgins does not see, and indeed even at the resolution of the story, he still does not see, as he asks for his slippers.  If this were presented to current London and Broadway audiences it would never play the way it was written.  Professor Higgins would need to see the light and he would have to get his own slippers!The dubbing and the need for it is curious.  There is no doubt that Marni Nixon, who did the singing, has a beautiful and commanding voice, and we are the better for having heard her, but why is the dubbing so obvious?  It's almost as if Miss Hepburn is saying to the audience: they said it would be better if Miss Nixon sings instead of me because her voice is stronger and so very well trained.  And so Hepburn does not completely lip-sync some of the opening words of songs as though to remind us that she is not singing.  And the contrast between her delicate voice and then the sudden power of Marni Nixon's is obvious.  Beyond this is the question of why Julie Andrews, who has a voice to match that of Miss Nixon, and charisma and charm at least in the same ballpark as Miss Hepburn, wasn't asked to play the part that she knew so very well from her experience on the stage.  Still, as another reviewer has so acutely noted, if she had been asked, we would have missed her in Mary Poppins, which was made the same year.  I should also note that Hepburn was 33 or 34 years old when this was made (although she looked almost ten years younger).  Nonetheless she was playing the part of &quot;a good girl, I am,&quot; whom Pickering identifies in his call to Scotland Yard as being 21 years old.Curious.  But all is forgiven because Audrey Hepburn is just so beautiful, so elegant and so delightful in the part.  I especially loved her in the opening scene in her soiled clothes and hat and her sour voice.  By the way, I have heard Julie Andrews sing the part, although I never saw her on the stage, and the way she &quot;meow's&quot; Eliza's accent, like a cat's claw on a chalk board, is really amazing.  (Get the CD.)This is one of the best movie musicals ever made, a sheer delight highlighted not only by Rex Harrison and Audrey Hepburn, but by Stanley Holloway as the Liza's lovable rascal father and Wilfrid Hyde-White as the very understanding and very properly British Col. Pickering with opulent direction by the great George Cukor.  The sets and production numbers are gorgeous.  But see it for Audrey Hepburn, one of the great stars of the silver screen in one of her most memorable roles.",N/A

414552,"First off, I must say this, I've never seen the first two Mighty Ducks movies and I'm not especially a hockey lover. But I must confess I thought this movie was terrific and fun! Mostly aimed for teenagers, this is a great movie to watch!The whole team &quot;Mighty Ducks&quot; have won scholarships to prestigious Eden Hall: Charlie (Joshua Jackson), Goldberg (Shaun Weiss), Fulton (Elden Henson), Averman (Matt Doherty), Julie 'the Cat' (Colombe Jacobsen-Derstine), Russ (Kenan Thompson), Dwayne (Ty O'Neal), Luis (Mike Vitar), Ken (Justin Wong), Guy Germaine (Garette Ratliff Henson), Connie (Marguerite Moreau), and Adam (Vincent Larusso). But there are some changes for the team. First of all, one of the 'Basher Brothers' Dean Portman (Aaron Lohr) is not going to join them. But most important, their coach Gordon Bombay (Emilio Estevez) won't be coaching them anymore. Charlie can't accept that and even more can't accept their seemingly harsh new coach, Ted Orion (Jeffrey Nordling). The 'Mighty Ducks' have a big game ahead of them against the Varsity team 'Warriors' who are going to be hard to beat. Will they be able to beat them and show them who's the best?With plenty of suspense and humor, &quot;D3: The Mighty Ducks&quot; is certainly worth the watch. Terrific acting done by the whole cast, including the notable actor Joss Ackland who plays Hans, the good friend and mentor to the 'Ducks'. The suspense during the hockey games were sometimes pretty intense, especially the last game between the 'Ducks' and the 'Warriors'. As for the humor, the movie was hilarious, I was laughing most of the time!A few of my favorites parts are when the 'Ducks' play pranks on the Varsity team and when Bombay gives his little 'speech' to the board members of Eden Hall. And a few of my favorite lines is:Cheerleader: Cheerleaders only. Are you a cheerleader?Linda: Do I look like an idiot?Connie: This ninja stuff makes you look, I don't know, how would you say...Guy Germaine: Ruggedly handsome?Connie: Amazingly stupid.Dwayne (while swinging a lariat at one of the Varsity members): It would be more fun for me if you ran.For parents, the movie is rated PG for the reason that there are some bad words sprinkled here and there. Other than that and the game of hockey being pretty rough, it's pretty good! I can't wait to watch the first two movies! I hope they're as good as the third one! If you haven't seen this movie, I highly recommend it!",D3 - The Mighty Ducks VHS
557160,"This movie is a must-see for anyone who enjoys war flicks, or who has an interest in the American Revolution.  It is not a perfect movie, but its strong points overwhelm the relatively few week ones.  Mel Gibson does his customary stellar job, and the acting overall is pretty good, and the story is very good indeed.  An unabashedly pro-American movie, but then again what's wrong with that?  It is still legal to make the odd movie that happens to celebrate American patriotism.The thing I liked best about the movie is that it really did convey a sense of what it might have been like to live in American revolutionary times.  It was a long war and a hard war, and ideals had to have been what kept the outgunned and outmanned patriots going.  The Brits are portrayed as the bad guys, but not, except for one villain, as bad guys.  I get a kick out of recommending this movie to my British friends.The story keeps going, there is a beginning, a middle, and an exciting ending.  That's more than can be said of most movies nowadays.  A keeper and a must for any DVD collection.",N/A
691391,"I have to admit: when I first saw the series I wasn't really thrilled. Of course, I only saw the German version which was dubbed in the former G.D.R. This version was censored quite heavily. For instance every reference to Holmes' drug abuse was cut out, which happens to be an important aspect of Holmes' personality. Being used to the film versions with Basil Rathbone and Peter Cushing I also thought that Jeremy Brett was quite overacting. Today I am ashamed of that.I challenge you: read the original stories by Sir Arthur Conan Doyle - you will never find a better and finer Holmes on film than the one performed by Jeremy Brett. And let's not forget Watson. Finally there is a real Doctor and not a mere comic relief. David Burke and in later seasons Edward Hardwicke are a pure joy to watch. Furthermore in every episode you have a great cast. Some of the biggest talents British TV has to offer.The producers went to a great deal of trouble to make the series as ""right"" as possible. Although Baker Street 221b didn't exist in Holmes' time the production designers recreated a room of the exact proportions that would have fit in a house of that time and area. Every detail was thoroughly investigated, like the colour and shape of the drapes or the carpet. Another important reference were the original book illustrations by artist Sidney Paget. His pictures literally come to live. Nothing is missing, not even the Persian slipper where Holmes keeps his tobacco.This boxed set (The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes) is the complete first season. Just watch out for the next titles of the series. Let's hope we don't have to wait too long for them.",The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes

While at the same time, a detective(Lindo),who has had a bad past with Raines, is trying to catch him in the act so he can 'put him away' for good. Sounds corny huh?

He decides to leave the house to find himself, we could say that what he finds out is that that life was the one that he longed for, but that's simplistic as hell. So, while he is out there thinking how it was that he fell out of love, his best buddy Sam (Jeff Daniels) has finally found the one girl he's looked for all his life -or is she?. This 1988 film starred Don Johnson in the best work of his career (so far) and Susan Sarandon in some kind of post-Springsteen characters story (theirs was the idyllic marriage, they were the king and queen of high school) and they are now trapped in the routine of marriage.

529026,"I already have written a review on ""Almost Famous,"" after I saw it in the earlier part of 2001.  However, rumor of this ""Bootleg Cut""  kept me from purchasing the original.  When mom used to say ""patience is a virtue,"" this was one of those reasons to take her on her word!Writer/Producer/Director Cameron Crowe presents ""Almost Famous"" in it's original incarnation titled: ""Untitled!""  Yes, you heard right.  Crowe finally had the chance to insert the sequences that explained more of his characters, gave him a better piece of mind, and probably told things that wouldn't be understood by the audience (the film originally ran 2 hours long, and the 35 minutes that appear in ""Untitiled"" would probably make some squrim out of boredom in their seats).For those not sure of the film, here's the summary:  William Miller is a young man trapped in a family with an overbearing mother and her hope that one day, he will become a great lawyer.  But in actuality, William loves Rock and Roll, and he uses his love of music to write reviews and reports for several local and underground papers.  One day, Rolling Stone magazine gets ahold of his work, and asks William to do a story for them.  William then takes to the road with the up and coming band called ""Stillwater,"" where he meets the lead guitarist Russell Hammond(Billy Crudup), and even the infamous Penny Lane(Kate Hudson), a young girl who's the most enigmatic screen presence you may ever see.The extras that Crowe includes in this DVD set include audio commentary by himself and (possibly a first for an audio guest) his Mom!  She's very informative, and also helps keep the conversation lively.  There's also a longer cut of a scene featuring the band ""Still Water,"" as well as articles Crowe wrote for Rolling Stone in his youth (this film is actually a biopic of his life, with some fiction).  There is also a great interactive scene that requires you to have Led Zeppelin's ""Stairway to Heaven"" on audio, CD, Vinyl or any form you can get your hands on it.  Trust me, get a copy of ""Stairway"" if you get this DVD set. What it's for is a great scene that was cut because they couldn't get the copyright for the song.As an added bonus, there is a 6-song CD featuring the music written for the band ""Stillwater"" in the film.  Every single song is Excellent!  Not a bad one in the bunch.The set contains the original cut of the film on Disc 2, which is a great way to compare the cut for the big screen, and the true director's vision.The film has been known to off-put some people ( almost all my family didn't like it), but for those that like music, nostalgia, and a film that is really unlike what most people create or experience, this is a great set to get.",Almost Famous

The animation is very neat and looks great, but the cliched over the top ridiculous storyline and borderline terrible voice acting just about kills anything enjoyable with Golgo 13: Queen Bee.  The Queen Bee, a female guerilla renegade who seems to have sex with just about anything that moves, is really the main character here and Duke is in more of a supporting role.

The movie saved the cheesy feminine touch which is so part of the characters and of the whole story, and added a modern twist. Today's ""angels"" are funnier, sexier, and they have more special effects on their side!Cameron Diaz plays a sweet, naive girl who dreams of being a dancer, and is instead a butt-kicking ""angel""; Lucy Liu has a fianc&eacute;e who doesn't know what her real job is, and she dreams of becoming a great cook and a great wife for him, so she gets very annoyed when her souffle gets shot (in an attempt to kill her) at and therefore looses all its puffiness; Drew Barrimore is the brat of the situation, my personal favorite.The characters are taken too far on purpose, and that's what makes them funny.

704062,"I have had something like a thirty year desire to see this, director Luchino Visconti's second film. To my knowledge, it has never enjoyed wide theatrical distribution, which given its content and tone, is hardly surprising. A relentlessly downbeat view of the lives of Sicilian fishermen, it's also a tad on the long side. Still, to have it available on video is a wonderful treat. I can't imagine myself watchiing it frequently, but it has a compositional integrity that more than compensates for the depressing subject matter.Never having seen the film projected, I cannot gauge the effectiveness of the video transfer. My guess is that it is so-so: good enough to give a sense of what the film looks like but not produced with enough care to bring out all the richness of detail and contrast. The opening credits, for example, superimposed over images of dawn in the fishing village, are barely intelligible. With a little more effort, the disc producers could probably have found a way to make the sequence work on video. As it is, we more or less have to imagine what it would look like.""La Terra Trema"" is Italian Neorealism at its most epic. Unlike De Sica's ""Bicycle Thief,"" for example, which reveals the tragedy of one man's decline, ""Terra"" self-consciously uses the Valastro family as an example of a larger phenomenon. Visconti makes no effort to conceal his political prejudices, at one point clearly identifying the corrupt, exploitive wholesalers with the recently deposed Mussolini regime while relentlessly identifying the central characters' problems with social and economic forces.The hopelessness of the situation is relieved only by the internal cohesion of the family which, nonetheless, undergoes severe tests. While we can well imagine the Valastros sinking even lower after the film's ambiguous ending, what is most striking about the film more than fifty years after its release, is its essential *optimism.* The call for a united front to withstand exploitation is good, old-fashioned Marxism at its most bald and unapologetic. The film's unabashed faith in human nature and the possibility of positive change feels not so much naive as nostalgic, the product of a time when it was still possible to believe in broad, systemic change. Wrapped in Visconti's well-known eye for sensuous spectacle, ""La Terra Trema"" is a good two-and-a-half hour tract just shy of convincing.",La Terra Trema
525677,"(Note: this review is of the movie as released in theaters, not of the DVD, which promises to come out with several more hours of deleted scenes.)I just saw HP for the second time in the theaters yesterday, after practically memorizing all four books.  My brother and I were quite disappointed, while my mother enjoyed it.  Probably because she'd never read the books.The difficulty I had with the movie is that it made *such* an effort to be true to the book, that the 90% of the book that was cut for time was all the more obvious and disappointing.  The end result was a set of disjointed scenes that contained the bare minumum of information that the screenwriters could convey and still advance the plot.Most of the character development (and actually, several of the *characters*) was cut for time.  All dialogue was so intent on getting the needed information to the audience in as short a time as possible, that the conversations seemed forced - quite unlike the natural flow of the book's dialogue.  And the humor - one of the biggest strengths of the books - was eliminated almost entirely (Fred and George, for example, had a grand total of three short scenes and two jokes).  The most touching scenes of the book (Dumbledore's &quot;she loved you&quot; exchange with Harry at the end, and Hagrid's gift of the pictures of Harry's parents) were present, but rushed and not developed, and so they carried no emotional impact.  Particularly since the movie cut most of the information that would have gotten across just how starved for love Harry had been with the Dursleys.As for the acting, it was passable.  Harry's actor needs some work.  Ron and Hermione are well played, as are Snape, Quirell, and Hagrid.  Dumbledore (what little we saw of him) was well-played, but seemed considerably more tired than I pictured.  I saw no twinkle in his eyes, and he wasn't nearly as inspiring as in the books.Most of my problems relate to the cutting, which was of course necessary because of time constraints.  I just hate to see what they'll do to Book 4..",N/A
570832,"It's very true that sequels rarely match the quality of the original film (in fact, we're often lucky if they're even WATCHABLE).  The original Blair Witch Project was an effective horror film.  While it didn't exactly scare me, it stayed with me, and I wouldn't ever go camping right after watching that film-no way!  But I had heard that the sequel was a horrible movie, and I only watched it after reading two reviews that praised the film.  But when I did watch it, I was utterly shocked.  Let's just say that I'm frustrated with all the people who told me that this was a terrible movie, because their comments almost kept me from watching one of the best horror films I've ever seen.The plot is fairly predictable-we've seen this all before.  A group of people agree to spend the night at a spot that's supposed to be haunted, cursed, etc. hoping to witness some supernatural phenomena.  They bring cameras to record such phenomena if it occurs.  Terrifying events ensue.  What sets this film apart is the strong sense of forboding that looms over the characters right from the beginning.  The atmosphere is perfect-you know that something is going to happen, something bad, but you don't know what.  And when it does happen, it's not what you expect (or rather, it doesn't happen the way you'd expect it to).  No horrible monsters jump out and kill the main characters, no, this film is into portraying a far more subtle, powerful evil.  The 5 main characters attempt to stay awake the entire night, but they awaken the next morning and discover that they've fallen asleep, and they don't remember what happened in the last 5 hours.  One of the characters lives at an abandoned broom factory (ha ha) and so the group meets there to view the footage they recorded during the night, in hopes of finding out what happened to them during those 5 hours.From the beginning, there are clues that things are not what they seem to be.  The greatest triumph of this film is that it leaves you puzzling over what happened-what is true and what isn't?  Exactly what role did the supernatural play in the events that unfolded after the group met that night in the woods?  Is it safe to assume, as one character states, that ""video doesn't lie""?In recent years, we have seen an increasing number of ""self-aware"" horror films (ha ha, look at us, we're poking fun at the horror genre`) and that's fine.  But I've missed truly scary horror films, films that portrayed evil as something truly bad-horrifying, powerful, and able to ruin lives.  This film captures that spirit perfectly.  Don't play around with evil, it'll get inside you, mess you up, and then kill you.  That's genuinely scary, that's what horror movies are supposed to do, and that's what this film does perfectly.  So don't listen to all the reviewers who hated this movie.  It's not for everyone, but many highly intelligent people enjoyed this film, and I would go as far as to say that it's even better than the original.",N/A

Well it was a bit like it, but it set itself apart too. I really get into these types of movies but mainstream movie goers will probably feel as though they've wasted their money. Personally I hope to see it again in the theater just to make sure I got it all. My recommendations if youre going to see this movie, see with a friend or loved one, and see it quick because once Gangs of New York comes out, then this will be gone. (if its there that long.)This is by far George Clooney's best movie since ""Out of Sight"". He can really act if given the right script and movie to play in. He did a good job of being the lonely guy. And you can tell right off that something has gone wrong and he feels responsible.I felt this movie moved along nicely. It keeps you guessing but not too much. It wraps up nicely with no loose ends. They weave bits and pieces of science versus morality in with threads of human anxiety and morality. Overall it seemed chilling and a bit eerie with some obvious Sci-fi references thrown in for fun.But alas, this is a love story. and I felt that S. Sodobergh did a good job of putting that element at the forefront. I would say if you have patience go and see this at the matinee, or just wait and get the DVD.",Solaris
701518,"I watched this movie as a joke.  The first movie was okay but that's comparing it with the book.  This ""sequel"" (only by name) is meant to be a satire I think but it came off as a joke to me.  I laughed at it and actually was entertained by how bad it really was.  It's a badly made movie by a director who obviously did it for the paycheck (we hope) but I couldn't help laughing and getting a kick out of this movie.  This movie will definitely have an audience and a cult following (a small one but large enough to be classified as a cult following) but for most people, it will be horrible.  Just take it as a comedy and you might actually enjoy it.  Then again....you could make some sort of drinking game out of this movie I bet lol.",N/A
262922,"Clownhouse (Victor Salva, 1988)I really don't want to say Clownhouse is a bad film. I mean, you've got a standup comic (Tree) dressed up as a  psychotic killer clown menacing three teenage boys with his two equally psychotic associates. It's a late-eighties horror flick. I mean, how bad can it be?Well, the answer is, pretty bad. And as much as the recent rash of email chain letters attempting to get Salva's  films boycotted drives me to want to contribue to Salva's coffers, I'd rather watch Powder for twenty-four hours back-to-back than sit through this dog again. Salva enjoys descending  into the realm of teen sex comedy humor all too often, including the inevitable masturbation jokes. Salva (who also wrote the screenplay) has a less then fine ear for  dialog. At times, in fact, it gets positively hideous.It probably says more than I ever could about the film that only two of the ten top-billed actors in the film, Sam  Rockwell (whose film debut was Clownhouse, and who has since gone on to such films as The Green Mile, Heist, and Galaxy Quest) and Karlheinz Teuber (coming back to the screen  next year in Kung Phooey), made more than one film after Clownhouse.Do yourself a favor and avoid it like the plague. * 1/2",N/A

It's so refreshing to watch a film showing the men in the military the proud, brave, courageous, honorable men that they are. This film doesn't depict soldiers as the cartoonish soldier who doesn't feel pain. This movie showed their human side, they were friends, they were shot, they were hurt, they died, and they stood next to their buddies protecting each other until they were killed or out of amunition and then killed.

408146,"I watched this movie on the recommendation of a couple of frequent movie viewers.  This film was fun to watch on a rainy Sunday morning.  It was not profound, and while most of the characters have a happy resolution of their problems, the film will not appeal to all.  If you are a Jane Austen fan and love Emma in particular, the film will appeal to you for three reasons - firstly, the heroine Flora Poste slings off Jane Austen quotes and references (beginning with her intention to write her ""Persuasion"" when she is 53);  secondly, because Flora acts much like Emma in trying to improve and manage the lives of others (without being blind to her own true love);  and lastly, because the heroine Flora is played by Kate Beckinsale (who will go to to play Emma in the Andrew Davis/A&E; version, called Emma 3).  There are also a number of other stellar actors, most notably Sir Ian McKellen (playing a hell-raising preacher) and Eileen Atkins (playing his sad-sack cousin/wife).I have not read the book nor seen the 1971 version, and therefore can judge the film only by its own merits.  While the film left me with a smile on my face, it also left me a little puzzled.  What was Judith Starkadder's real problem, why does she feel the family owes something to Robert Poste's child, and what did Aunt Ada Doom see in the woodshed?A brief plot summary:  London society girl Flora Poste discovers that she has only 100 pounds a year, which will not keep her in stockings.  She decides to write to her many relatives to see if one of them will take her in (this is the 1930s, I believe).  Flora decides to go to the most interesting set of relatives - the Starkadder cousins on Cold Comfort Farm.  The family are portrayed as hillbillies in the worst sense, completely wedded to tradition, dirty and ignorant, unwilling to reform (such as using a dishmop instead of twigs).  [Warning:  this depiction of British farmers of the 1930s may be offensive to some].Flora arrives at Cold Comfort Farm to discover that the farm and the family are apparently cursed.  The family seems to feel that it owes something to her as Robert Poste's child (this is never explained in the film) but her cousins deeply resent her.  The cousins are Amos and Judith Starkadder (cousins who married), their sons Reuben and Seth (the latter a lusty young man who loves the talkies), and several others.  Gradually, Flora changes the way in which her Starkadder cousins live (by cleaning up the house, beginning with her bedroom curtains), persuades nearly each member of the family to make some critical changes, and also brings about three marriages in the future.  All this, while also dangling along a London-based ""embryo parson"" with his own airplane and a locally-based ""writer"" who fancies himself in love with her.Quick summary:  The film was entertaining as long as it is not taken seriously.  There was an element of snobbery in the relations between the city people and the country people that I did not quite like (even if it is true of this period and of today).  The depiction of the gulf between the ""county"" families and the farmers is hinted at, but made light of.  However, there is enough interest sustained in the movie, aided with strong acting from Kate Beckinsale (Flora Poste), Sir Ian McKellan (Amos Starkadder), Eileen Atkins (Judith Starkadder), and Rufus Sewell (Seth Starkadder) that carries the viewer along.  Recommended for lovers of Jane Austen, or for lovers of eccentric British films.  Some crudity but not as much as in WITHNAIL AND I or the BLACKADDER series.",Cold Comfort Farm VHS

The meteor starts to spawn all sorts of weird alien life forcing the inept duo who discovered it to save the world.My Opinion: The trailer made this movie look pretty cool with its excellent special effects and awesome aliens. But it hid the fact that this is a farce comedy. All the special effects and cool aliens are just the backdrop for the slapstick and gross out humor that makes up the core of this movie. David Duchovny and Orlando Jones play stooge like college teachers. They team up with a klutzy fireman want to be  Seann William Scott. Together these three take every scrap of seriousness out of this movie.

484207,"Despite the film's flaws, I found it visually stunning.  The opening sequence with the dead Santa Clauses from an aerial view is orignial; and the film then rewinds in flashback.  The snow-filled scenes of December are well-shot.  Ben Affleck as Rudy Duncan is a well scrubbed prisoner who seems neither worldly nor criminal.  When he tells Ashley, ""I had better sex in prison,"" one sees neither the experience nor the emotional scars.  I saw the film in theatrical release and was firmly convinced that the movie starred Ashley Judd.  I was about 45 minutes into the picture when I said to my wife, ""That's not Ashley Judd; that's the woman from 'Sweet November.'""  Charlize Theron is beautiful.  Her ability to deceive only comes clear as the plot unfolds; we don't really sense the a deep mysterious layer; so it doesn't all hang together, for me.  But I loved the moment when Rudy is on his knees in the snow, about to be shot, and he tells her how Nick (prison mate) loved her.  She looks at him knowingly and says something like, ""Who wouldn't?""  It's at that moment that we can hate her.  The problem, of course, is who do we like?  James Frain as Nick is sensitive and seems also out-of-place in the prison, plus hard to believe in the ending.  It was nice to see Mod Squad's tv show Clarence Williams III as a bank robber.  Gary Sinise was good as the bumbling villain.  Dennis Farina as Jack Bangs the casino owner has great moments laying bloodied on the table keeps repeating, ""I can't go back to Vegas.""  The fact that he's been beaten, laying on a table at gunpoint, and still worried about his job security is humorous at an unlikely moment.  Ehren Kruger's script is so full of plot twists and turns that it is like a roller coaster ride in that you're never sure what's coming next; however, the roller coaster does seem to get off track a bit.  While not classic, this is visually well shot with great pacing.  Enjoy!",Reindeer Games VHS

The perpertrators are so bland and typical that I was thinking of the thugs in ""Home Alone"" trying to be serious.  Did not recognize Dwight Yokum.

The movie is engrossing, very well acted, and even haunting...but is it among the best of all time? Probably not.The main thrust of the is that insecure people do a lot of dumb things if they cannot find love (a hint: everybody in this story is insecure). Maybe all the characters should have followed Sigorney Weaver's character's advice to Christina Ricci's character and gone off into the desert. They all act (adults and teens) like adolescents.Perhaps there is a broader lesson to be drawn from this very well done picture: When the foundations of sand that we--as a society--build for ourselves crumble, those without a more lasting foundation are bound to suffer. The folks in this movie sure do.All in all, ""The Ice Storm"" is a very watchable, intriguing film. A film just like it (American Beauty) deserved the Oscar it won. Maybe ""The Ice Storm"" deserved one too. I recommend this movie highly.",Ice Storm VHS

143737,"I was like her once.... Maybe that's why this movie is so heartbreaking for me to watch. Its whole buildup to the inevitable climax at the Bates High School prom is so expertly constructed out of plot devices, stellar character development, and amazing visual style that we are helplessly swept out to sea by the undertow of our love for the title character. Carrie White (flawless Sissy Spacek) is so wonderfully innocent and remarkably performed that we have no choice in the matter. We are like her prom date at first: Sort of iffy, but then we can't help but adore her. And we can't help but empathize with her because of this grotesque life that she is forced to lead by her pamphlet-pushing religious radical of a mother (the outstanding Piper Laurie). The scenes between the mother and daughter in this film are the key to its satirical elements, as well as giving us a crucial understanding of Carrie's mind. We know why she's so shy, so emotionally distraught, because we would be too in her situation. The very first scene between Spacek and Laurie is a virtuoso, not so much of acting as being the characters, embodying them so fully that all traces of the actresses disappear. They are the key to the entire film; that and Brian Depalma's incredible visuals, which inject every last bit of fear into our veins. Depalma comments on one of the DVD documentaries that he had more time to toy with the visuals in ""Carrie"" than in any other movie he made. It shows. His POV and incredibly detailed crane shots are why certain scenes work at all. By seeing what these characters see, it becomes easier to understand why they act the way they do. Some people might criticize for the excessive use of slow motion, calling it overkill, but it does volumes for the buildup to the climax, which is so powerful with its harsh, constant musical undertone that I dare call it one of the best, most disquieting scenes ever filmed. As Carrie's dark and ruthless use of her telekinetic powers practically rules her body as she wreaks havoc, if not for the sounds of the film itself, you could hear a pindrop every time I've watched the film with company.The film begins with Carrie in the far corner of the screen, awaiting a volleyball toss that she will miss, provoking insults from the girls in her gym class. Then we are shown the locker room in what would have been an exploitation shot if not for the fact that the music and slow motion camerawork make it seem so beautiful. But we are also put on our guard because of this shot, which shows full frontal nudity; frowned upon in most corners of cinema. However it makes one thing clear: This is a director who will do anything. All the ""Halloween"" cliches are not to be found here. There are no cheap shocks. Everything is crafted with only the purpose of building tension, from the blood cascading down Carrie's leg in the shower to one of the single best crane shots I've ever seen, where our fears are allowed to build and build to the breaking point, only to have them build some more before the final purge. The parallel stories of a revenge plot and Carrie's being asked to the prom by the most popular guy in school take the film along at the exact pace it needs, and the intercut scenes with Carrie and her mother supply the emotional center for the film, which rests with our love for Carrie: A character so sweet and unassuming that the slow motion approach to the stage brings a smile to our faces too, even though we are terrified of what awaits her. Therein lies the power of the film. The more we love Carrie, the more we hate her antagonists and feel hurt that they would be so cruel.""Carrie"" is quite possibly the single most dramatically sound horror film ever made. It maps out its characters so vividly and realistically that we never question anyone's actions. There's none of those traditional ""She's so stupid!"" remarks you hear in so many a horror film audience. ""Carrie"" is the real deal. A film that builds an entire house made out of brittle cards of terror, stacking it up until it falls and our fears are realized. There are no scenes of ridiculous scares or people jumping out of the closets to scare their buddies. Depalma recognizes these kind of devices for what they are: Useless. His film is a superb example of how many ways a story can go right, and it is a masterpiece that I am proud to place very high on my list of favorite films.",N/A

520726,"I am not usually a fan of expanded, so-called Director's Cuts of popular movies; usually, they are nothing more than inserted scenes designed to differentiate the film sufficiently enough to garner additional sales from loyal fans.THE LORD OF THE RINGS - THE FELLOWSHIP OF THE RING (PLATINUM SERIES EXTENDED EDITION) is a worthy exception in that the additional 30 or so minutes of footage truly augments and enhances the story.  While I have been a long-time devoted fan of LOTR, I found that the theatrical version, despite some omissions and deviations from the book, was an absolutely marvelous work.  The extended edition is, in my opinion, even better, particularly in the beginning.  The new &quot;shire&quot; opening provides a deeper glimpse into the magical world of the Hobbits and gives the viewer, particularly those who have not read the books, a better understanding of the characters as they develop throughout the movie.  While other scenes are brief, they provide just the extra touch needed to clarify a plot twist or character later in the story.A pleasant surprise is the addition of poetry and song snippets which were such a nice part of the books.  They are not just inserted gratuitously, but rather bring just a touch of additional insight as to the various characters and their unique charms.The quality of the four disc set is very good, although the length and additional features require that the movie be contained on two discs.  The first disc ends rather abruptly (as if someone just turned off the switch rather than a more graceful scene ending fade), however the separation was unavoidable given the limited capacity of the DVD discs, especially with the addition of the various commentaries which can be accessed along with the movie.I have not had the time to fully view the various appendices on discs three and four, however what I have watched to date has been most enjoyable.

That aspect, however, was never among the reasons to see ""Starman"". What makes it worthwhile are it quirky, touching love story, its gentle humor, and Jeff Bridges extraordinary performance as the alien, for which he received an Oscar nomination. Here, he proved himself to be among the great physical actors of his generation. Even if the story itself were not so strong, it would be worth watching the movie simply to see Bridges.Starman comes to visit our planet after we launch a satellite that broadcasts an `invitation' to any intelligent life that might be out there. As you might expect, though, when he gets here, the first thing our military does is to shoot him down. After bailing out, he makes his way to the isolated home of Jenny Hayden [Karen Allen], the widow. While she is sleeping, he looks around the house and finds some home movies and a photo album. This is how he finds and assumes the shape off her husband [we never see Starman's real shape]. His actions awaken her, and she has a shocked first encounter with this apparition. As military helicopters approach, Starman has no choice but to commandeer Jenny and her car for a mad dash across the country to Arizona, where he has one chance to rendezvous with a rescue ship from home.

The plot is clear and consistent. Katie Carr is stunning as Marion. It's not too Disneyfied and sugary, though there is just a touch of that. There is also something you seldom find in movies - a good villain. By that I mean a villain who is not a comic-book bad-guy, but a fully believable and real person who is devious, selfish, ruthless, and always distorting the truth, yet manages to be almost likeable in his own way.

I was kind of expecting one of those stupid special-effects focused horror movies that would be pretty retarded overall, but this turned out to be an exceptionally creepy movie.  There were virtually no amazing visual effects in it, because they weren't neccessary fot the movie.  Based on the old gothic horror story ""The Turn of the Screw"" by Henry James, the movie is about a mother of two children who hires some new servants at her mansion, and the children begin to see strange, eerie things that are made creepy not by what you see but by what you simply hear.  The simple sounds of footsteps thumping upstairs and the sillhouettes of small children at night make the film very genuinely freaky, and this movie is built more on psychological horror than anything else.  Overall, this movie is very good (especially if you watch it in the dark, like any horror movie), and I highly recommend it.",The Others

587726,"If you're selfish and self-absorbed (but don't know it), you'll probably love this colorful film about a single mother's 25-year climb to the best-seller list.  If not, you'll probably just shake your head.  The problem with ""Riding in Cars with Boys"" isn't that it lacks charm or humor; the problem is that it suggests that charm and humor in a person should supplant good judgment, character and sensitivity--even when that person is responsible for someone else.  Drew Barrymore gives her standard perky performance as Beverly Donofrio, a headstrong girl who defies her blue-collar parents (James Woods and Lorraine Bracco in interesting bits) and quickly finds herself pregnant.  Opting for marriage to a soon-to-be-junky loser (played effectively by Steve Zahn), Bev struggles to get to college but not before developing an angry Martyr Complex about her son and dabbling in the drug trade.  The movie's flashback scenes between the now successful Bev and the brash young woman she once was are at times effective--she actually seems a bit smarter and more sensitive in her youth--but too often we're supposed to chuckle at her poor decisions rather than hold her responsible for them.  In fact, the film seems to dodge the tougher question of why we should care about Bev in the first place, as she simply drifts from one crisis to the next, especially when her now-grown son points out all of the psychological trauma being her son has caused.  I guess it's supposed to be all that nostalgic music and Bev's pluck or maybe that she's a single parent.  It's nice that things work out for her in the end--the film is apparently based on an autobiography--but viewers may be left with little sense that the character deserves success so much as fell into it.

Voyerism, wit and suspense are all well played and along with Jimmy's great performance, there is the amazing Grace Kelly and Ramond Burr as the surly neighbour who may, or may not have killed his wife. Franz Waxman's musical score adds a tense layer of gripping suspense, with one of the scores where the music is the 5th character. Everything about the film is brilliant.

I knew they departed from LMM's books, but I was shocked to find out how much.  The story is loosely based on the last book in the Anne series, ""Rilla of Ingleside"", about Anne's youngest daughter during the First World War.  Being the only North American woman's written account of the war, it is a very famous book, and although fiction, has historical value.  In the book Anne & Gibert are middle-aged and the book centers around their young adult children, but the movie has Anne searching for Gilbert on the battle lines!  Of course Anne has a flirtation along the way even though she and Gilbert are married.  What were LMM's descendants thinking when they allowed this movie to be made!?The first two movies are splendid and are true to LMM's characters in ways that the third movie is not.  Although poetic license was used, especially in the 1st sequel, they went a bit further in this second sequel.  Anne didn't seem like Anne.  Gilbert and Diana were so thin they were almost unrecognizable.  How different was Megan Follows as Anne?  One of my friends commented to me that she had seen the movie and actually was under the impression that the actor who played Anne was not Megan Follows!!I think the most unforgiveable thing to me is how they portrayed Anne & Gilbert's wedding, which was so beautiful in the book ""Anne's House of Dreams""!My hope is that if Sullivan productions tackles such a project again that they present ""Anne's House of Dreams"", a wonderful story, and stick to the words that made LMM famous!

357224,"This has always been one of my favorite movies of all time and I have been waiting for a quality DVD Edition to come out, hopefully with some missing scenes.  The DVD looks and sounds absolutely great;  no complaints about the transfer.  A second disc loaded with extras, including about 30 minutes worth of behind the scenes interviews and the like, also adds to the overall value.  My biggest disappointment is with the so-called 'directors cut' edition of the film.  As far as I can tell, there is roughly four minutes worth of additional scenes added to the movie and off the top of my head, this amounts to four scenes of mixed quality in terms of moving the story along (in particular, a mercifully short scene with Doc Holiday's inebriated solo ranting on the night Morgan and Virgil are shot does absolutely nothing to move along the story and it is obvious why this was cut from the theatrical release).  There are a couple of good scenes added, both of which explain further the demise of the relationship between Wyatt and his wife as well as Doc and Kate the Prostitute.  Here is what really, really bugs me;  when you watch the trailers or commercials for this movie (and the second disk is loaded with them), you can see plain as day that there are at least three other scenes which were shot in some form that are of some interest that never ever made it to this director's cut!  Check it out on the trailers and note:  Kurt Russell and Dana Delaney getting passionate in the woods, Doc helping Wyatt up from the river following the gunfight with Curly Bill and his gang, and Jason Priestley nervously pulling a rifle on somebody.  Where were these scenes on this disk?  All in all, the movie is a must have on DVD and the quality of the transfer as well as the movie itself rates very, very highly.  I just feel somewhat 'had' over the lack of these scenes, which I myself was looking forward to finally seeing.",N/A

Prospero's Books matches the former for the rich tapestry that is presented on the screen.  The story, however, from the Shakespeare play &quot;The Tempest&quot;, is complex, difficult to follow, and over the top.  This isn't a turnoff, however, as I have found that I have continued to gain understanding about the story each time I watch this movie.  This movie mixes multiple levels of reality and dream simultaneously, making your first viewing confusing, but each additional viewing a treat for the mind, in addition to the eyes.

520581,"I don't usually review movies but I have to pay tribute to Peter Jackson's impressive film version of LOTR.  Jackson and his team have exercised unusual talent and intelligence in bringing LOTR to the screen.  Jackson and his co-writers made a number of changes in the plot, mainly deleting some subplots and minor characters.  These choices were made very well, not sacrificing any of the dramatic integrity of the story, and are really necessary for keeping a movie, even a 3 part film with long individual components, within reasonable commerical bounds.  Jackson's team is remarkably faithful to Tolkien's vision; their realization of many of the most important setpieces within the books is remarkable.  Most important of all, Jackson and his team have really been faithful to Tolkien's moral vision.  LOTR is a story about the virtues of courage and decency, and the need to and costs of resisting evil.  The LOTR films, with excellent performances from the entire cast, capture this very well.  Jackson has done a particularly good job of making the Ring of Power itself a protagonist in the film.  This insidious source of evil and corruption is the real villain of the piece.  Tolkien's opposition of the pull of the Ring against Frodo's quiet moral courage is tremendous moral drama which Jackson has brought to the fore of his movies.",The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring
600976,"Perfect summer entertainment, except not as cheesy as most summer films. I had a great time with Blue Crush. It entertained and amazed the hell out of me. I was in awe of the incredible surfing sequences. We are taken right into the waves and feel as if we are actually there. Very well done cinematography. The surfing scenes couldn't get more perfect.Now the thing I've heard most complain about is the plot in between the amazing surfing scenes. And you know what? It really was not as bad as everyone was saying, in fact, I didn't think it was bad at all. I'll admit it was a little loose, but that's because the movie isn't really about the plot. It was less talk and more action and that was great, it doesn't give the viewer a chance to be bored. I thought they did a really good job with the actual story that was there. I never once found the diologue snicker worthy. Sure it's not Oscar material, but I have heard some really bad diologue in teen flicks (She's All That, Summer Catch) and the diologue in this movie doesn't come close to that.I also liked the romance. It wasn't that original yet it was interesting and never bored me. Plus I like how it didn't make up the entire movie and never delayed the ...surfing scenes, we spend a lot of time in the water. The realistic ending was also nice, if not a little disappointing at first. It doesn't end how most will expect it to end, which isn't a bad thing. That made it less predictable and I've got to give it props for that. Now I don't want anyone to take what I said the wrong way and expect a bad ending, it's not a bad ending that will leave you [angry] while walking out of the theater. So don't worry, it does end on a high note and have a happy ending, it's just a different happy ending than we thought.I think the diologue is getting unfairly bashed. Remember The Fast And The Furious? I thought that was a very fun movie, even if the diologue was cheesy. That movie was about the fast cars, not the plot. And although I knew it wasn't the best writing or plot it never bothered me once. I just sat back and enjoyed what was a very fun summer movie. And I can tell you for certain that the diologue here is not even close to as bad as it was in The Fast And The Furious. In that movie it was noticeable, in BLUE CRUSH I didn't notice at all. Maybe it's because the actors were able to pull it off with flying colors, or maybe it actually wasn't that bad. But whatever it was I didn't notice. The actors all did well with their parts, especially Bosworth. I can't wait to see her in more movies, like the upcoming RULES OF ATTRACTION. She's a star in the making.Overall, BLUE CRUSH is an excellent summer movie that should be experienced at the cinema. The excellent cinematography just won't be the same on video. Trust me, see it on the big screen. It's not the most original movie, but most movies aren't anymore. Everything has already been done in one way or another. I had a great time watching it. It's the only movie I've seen at the theater this summer and it was definitely a good choice.Grade: 8/10",Blue Crush

543475,"""Rush Hour 2"" is a highly enjoyable follow-up to the original 1998 box office smash.  Like the previous film, this first of what will undoubtedly be a long line of lucrative sequels combines sardonic humor with eye-popping martial arts action sequences to entertaining effect.  Chris Tucker and Jackie Chan repeat their roles as unlikely cop buddies, starting off the film in Chan's home territory, Hong Kong, and finishing up in Tucker's, the good ole US of A.Chan, with his sheepish deadpan delivery, makes a perfect straight man for Tucker's fast-talking bad brotha wiseacre, whose mouth engages in more heavy-duty action than Chan's karate-chopping hands and feet.  Much of the humor is generated by Tucker's ability to seem totally unflustered by any peril that happens to come his way, managing to sass talk his way out of one dangerous predicament after another.  Moreover, Chan's ability to create humor out of perfectly choreographed stunt sequences puts him right up there with some of the silent comedy greats like Chaplin and Keaton.  The split-second perfection of these scenes, combined with the balletic grace with which they are executed, makes him one of the truly unique talents working in movies today.  Luckily, in his move to mainstream American filmmaking, Chan has been able to find behind-the-scenes talent good enough to match his own.  The screenplay by Jeff Nathanson, though no world-beater when it comes to originality or depth, does posses a playful spirit that works well in the context of the genre.  Likewise, director Brett Ratner keeps the action percolating along at a lively, often dizzying clip.As with most Chan films, however, ""Rush Hour 2"" seems to go on for about a half hour too long - even though its running time barely clocks in at a very short 90 minutes.  Perhaps this type of material really can't be sustained much beyond an hour before the repetitiousness of it begins to take its toll.  However, that is certainly a minor quibble about a film that, for the most part, provides plenty of laughs, some kick-... performances and action sequences that, as per usual for a Chan film, will, quite literally, make your jaw drop.  .",N/A

701117,"There was a few David Fencher fans anxiously awaiting the arrival of ~Panic Room~. After the disappointment of 'The Game', we somehow knew that this interesting director would indeed attempt to out due himself, or at least show us that his casting director(s), after the dismal mistake with Michael Douglas, could redeem themselves. Let's face it, with a resume like Jodi Foster, its hard to go wrong, and this certainly was proved in ~Panic Room~. She puts in a grand performance that we've come to expect.This film grabs you from the start - the opening credits are original and quite impressive - so much so, they're worth the price of admission alone. In fact, call me strange, but I wanted to sneak back into the theatre during the second showing to see them again.The camera work is pure art. The planning for each shot shows an attention to detail and seamless quality that does not detract from the viewing. Confined to such a small space over months of shooting, every scene is painstakingly crafted; the editing is tight, which only adds to the suspense.The plot is almost laughably simple, but an excellent scenario in which to get actors and crew to surpass their limits as artists. Fencher surely achieved this end, because everything but the plot itself is superlative. During the first ten minutes of viewing, I kept thinking: in terms of style what does this film remind me of? Hitchcock came to mind. ~Panic Room~ has a 'Vertigo' and 'Rope' feel to it without question. For me, at any rate, this only added to the film's enjoyment.David Fencher set a new standard with his masterpiece, 'Seven' (another work of art in editing that won an Oscar nomination), which deserved all the acolades it received. But, unfortunately, ~Panic Room~ doesn't quite set a new standard, but more a thriller piece that should please moviegoers interested in this genre of film.A suggestion, do not wait for this film to come out on DVD or video, because it's made for the big screen.

579928,"The Diary of a Chambermaid is Luis Brunuel's masterpiece. Though it satirizes countless aspects of French society during the years leading up to WWII (1930, to be precise), includes several intriguing character studies, and carries off a complex plot, it still manages to captivate.  Though there is an obvious political statement about fascism, Brunuel seems to have been more intent on showcasing the complacent attitudes of the bourgeoisie that allowed Europe to crumble into the throes of war.Jeanne Moreau is Celestine, a beautiful Parisian chambermaid to moves to the Normandy countryside to work in the home of the wealthy Monteil family.  The cast of characters she discovers there are laughable.  The family patriarch, Monsieur Rabour, has a foot fetish (with which Celestine has no choice but to comply); his daughter is a frigid woman who cares about nothing more than her imported goodies (and her unvaluables too:  she counts sugar cubes to make sure the staff hasn't been stealing); her husband is an amourous fiend who seeks moments of ""amour fou"" (mad love) with Celestine.  Even Celestine's fellow servant-types have their quirks, except not so funny.  Joseph, the groundskeeper, is a ruthless racist and sadist who denounces ""kikes and wops,"" tortures animals and rapes and murders a child of whom Celestine was fond.  All the while, he is active in a right-winged Facist movement to rid France of foreigners and destroy the republic.It is the murder of young Claire, and her desire to see justice done, that keeps Celestine at the Monteil estate after her master dies (clutching a pair of shoes, no less).  She quickly focuses on Joseph.  She accuses him directly but fails to get a confession--though he didn't deny the act, either.  There's only one problem:  Celestine is forced to fight a sexual attraction to Joseph.  In the end, she uses sex as her last shot at extracting a confession.This film does not end with justice; nor does Celestine remain a character of moral fiber.  In the film's last scene, with Celestine having just proven herself to be the ultimate opportunist, the countrymen are marching through the streets toward right-wing brutality and fascism.From beginning to end, The Diary of a Chambermaid is an amusing look at everything Luis Brunuel apparently hated:  the bourgeoisie, complacency, fascism, Catholic (pay attention to the scene in which Madame Monteil asks the priest how to cope with her husband's advances), and the goverment.  This isn't knee-slapping funny, but a small slice of wisdom served up in black and white.",Diary of a Chambermaid

129526,"This 1984 sequel to the 1981 classic &quot;Raiders Of The Lost Ark&quot;, is a real important film to me. I saw it 11 times in the theaters and I was mesmerized. I hadn't seen anything like it before. It's one of those films that brings back great memories from your youth. Spielberg, Lucas, and Ford all return for this chapter. It takes place 10 years later, and Indy is joined by a nightclub singer, Willie Scott(Kate Capshaw), and a young sidekick named Short Round(Ke Huy - Quan from &quot;The Goonies&quot;), on a mission to find and rescue young children who have been kidnapped from a small village by some sort of cult. Indy and his gang infiltrate this incredible palace, only to discover the horror that lurks below the place. This film definitley has the Saturday morning serial cliffhanger thing going here. More so than the first and third installments. This movie is a little darker and more violent than &quot;Raiders&quot;. Some fans didn't think that was such a good thing. Their loss. This movie is a rollercoaster ride from beginning to end. It's a movie that never stops being entertaining. There are a number of classic scenes in here, like - The mine cart chase, the airplane scene, the water out the side of the mountain, the rope bridge. You know it's a good movie when you can think of a number of good scenes like that. Once again, Spielberg has a nice eye for details. Ford is the most charismatic hero of the century. No one comes close. Capshaw and Quan are on hand mostly for comedic support.

361236,"I think that ""Bleu"" has failed in what most more or less watchable films made in the 90s have failed. While it is beautifully shot, has a good casting, an appropriate musical score, and a number of highly original (and therefore interesting) scenes (where the use of music, the use of silence is very effective), on the whole it is rather pointless and thus boring. While watching it, I could not understand why it should have been called ""Bleu"". This story about a woman who survives a tragedy and has to struggle with her past (and present) is at times very delicate and realistic - and these scenes do come up in my mind from time to time - but it is shown in a way too limited in scope; the film on the whole does not remain in your mind for long, it lacks some strength, some backbone. I tried watching it the second time but it proved to be too boring to bear. I, nevertheless, would recommend everyone to see and think about ""Bleu"" by himself.",N/A
684550,"This new show from the creator of Project Ako is not a disapointment. It manages to bring light-hearted comedy to the screen as well as some fleshy scenes that might be appealing to some viewers who may feel animation belongs only in the realm of children.As I stated there are a few adult overtones in the show but these are laced with extreme insanity which, though it often does not work in a live action format, often does wonders for an animated feature. There are no direct nudity scenes in the show itself though the end credits leave little to the imagination.The voice tracks seem in some ways to be coming from different directions. The Japanese voice track does not seem to flow as easily as the English especially in the comedic scenes. The Japanese actors seem almost to be struggling with their characters but this might be expected. The original idea for the show was that of a samurai show after all. The English track was recorded long after the idea for the show was switched to comedy so the idea the English actors had was different from that given their Japanese counter-parts.Compared to other shows such as Love Hina the flare with which the characters tackle their environment may seem old fashioned but it is sure to appeal to anyone who likes comedy in anime.

588884,"This is not a perfect movie by any means. But Will Smith is brilliant as Ali, particularly during the early part of the film, where he superbly portrays the boxer in his young Cassius Clay days. I remember those years when Cassius Clay came to prominence, and Smith captures his spirit, his cheekiness, his strength, and his sheer, confident youth to a tee. As Clay grows as a boxer and as a man, embraces the Muslim faith, and becomes Muhammad Ali, he changes more than his religion and name. The cockiness is still there, but so is the cynicism and disappointment brought on by too much fame, too much money, too many women, too many hangers-on. Smith handles the change from brash youth to more thoughtful man with subtlety and aplomb.The disappointing part of the film, which begins to drag on and on, is the lack of depth in Ali's relationships. His marriages are glossed over quickly...we get no sense of what he is really thinking, or what his private life is really like. The same holds true of his relationships with his entourage, from his manager on down. If this was meant to come across as aloofness, it didn't work; this viewer found it very frustrating.Nevertheless, the movie is worth seeing, for the sheer exuberance of Smith's acting, and the absolutely dead-on portrayal of the late sportscaster Howard Cosell, rendered fabulously by Jon Voight. It is not a brilliant movie, but in my view, it deserves more than 3 stars. I think it is inexplicably under-rated.",Ali

The movie portrays the coming of age, sexual freedom and wayward view of the young adults of the 60's, the almost plastic existence of their future.  Dustin Hoffman stars as Benjamin and it is his breakout role.  He was thirty years old when he filmed the picture, but he perfectly captures the youthful, nave essence of the part.  Anne Bancroft vamps it up as Mrs. Robinson who seduces Benjamin.  Ms. Bancroft brings a sexy and sultry flair to the film and her role as a sexual predator was stunning at the time.  A third star of the film is the soundtrack by Simon & Garfunkel.  Their music is liberally intertwine throughout the film, the opening sequence set to ""The Sounds Of Silence"" is dead on and the use ""Scarborough Fair/Canticle"" adds a longing, somber note to the picture.  Of course the movie produced the number one hit ""Mrs. Robinson"" which won a Grammy as Record of the Year in 1968.  The film was just the second that Mike Nichols directed.  His first was Whose Afraid of Virginia Woolf, which was departure from his comedic background.

Yet another seemingly tacked-on ending.There were a couple of inspired scenes which appealed to my warped sensibilities: Dafoe and Furlong having a conversation via toilet during their placement in solitary confinement; and the tasteful scene where Dafoe slits his wrists, sprays blood all over himself and eats his own doodoo.

Three of the five shorts on this entry are among the teams' best, ""Three Little Beers"" (1935), ""Three Arabian Nuts"" (1951) and the underrated ""Three Smart Saps"" (1942).  However, I'm only awarding 2 stars due to:- Only 5 shorts on this disc?  Past volumes have included 6 (one with 7), and considering the information capacity of DVD, even more Stooge classics could easily fit.  I'm hoping this was a one-time-only shortchanging, and future volumes will provide more for the money.- Where's the quality control!!!  The print of ""Three Little Beers"" has 20 missing seconds due to a sloppy splice!  One of the funniest scenes in the short (Curly dropping a plethora of golf balls from his pockets) is GONE!I want to continue supporting Columbia's Stooge DVDs, but you will have to do better than this one guys.",N/A

At first I was a little skeptical since Malkovich isn't exactly the prototype big, strong guy I envisioned in the role of Lenny.  Gary Sinise was perfect for the cynical and smug role of George, but I was pleasantly surprised by Malkovich - where was the Oscar nod?Having read the book twice and thoroughly enjoyed it, the movie was hardly a disappointment as most movies based on classics turn out to be(Exhibit A:Mel Gibson's Hamlet).  In fact, Sinise's directorial effort coupled with the genius of Malkovich makes this one movie that seemingly tops the book.  And that's high praise.  Kudos.",Of Mice & Men VHS
428650,"Ray Barrett and wife Jennifer Daniels inherit his brother's Cornish cottage, after the brother's unusual demise by the mysterious ""Black Death.""  The locals aren't too friendly, especially austere neighbor Noel Willman, a reclusive gentleman famous for writing about obscure religious cults around the world.  Willman's lovely daughter, the inexplicably shy and subdued Jacqueline Pearce, is as friendly to Barrett and his wife as her father is hostile, and inadvertently engages them in what rapidly becomes an ugly murder plot  -  the same one that claimed Barrett's late brother.This is one of Hammer's better low-budgeters, which suffers from a few flaws:  it's slow moving and a bit padded; the music (as in many films from the same studio in the same period) is overly melodramatic; and the suspense is half-shot from the opening teaser, by explicitly showing precisely the mystery Barrett and Daniels are attempting to solve (though not quite all of its details).  It plays like a turn-of-the-century supernatural murder mystery, which is essentially what it is.However, it's splendidly acted by all involved, especially Willman and Pearce, who suffer from a guilty secret and a resultant family curse beyond their ability to explain to outsiders.  The sets and props are gorgeous, the scenery beautiful, the atmosphere heavy.  Pearce's makeup is magnificent, even if the papier-mache shows  -  it's a truly striking effect, and properly underused.  There are some very creepy and highly memorable scenes, most notably the finale and one in which Pearce  -  in a genuinely unspeakable condition  -  writhes around on her bed while an insidious Malaysian manservant chants over her body.Anyone enjoying this film should also check out Plague of the Zombies, made by the same production team and many of the same cast members.",Reptile VHS

Even with such an impressive list of movies, ""Passenger 57"" is by far his best work.Snipes plays John Cutter, an ex-cop / terrorism expert, with a rather large chip on his shoulder.

679509,"Jeepers Creepers (Victor Salva, 2001)I think that, with the arguable exception of Battlefield Earth, I haven't heard so much negative press about a movie in the past decade as I did about  this one. No idea why. This is one of the better horror movies to come out of Hollywood in quite a while, and Victor Salva has finally lived up to the promise that's kept Hollywood allowing him to make bad movies on a fairly  regular basis for the past decade and a half.The story opens with a brother and sister team, Derry (Justin Long, from the TV series Ed) and Trish (Gina Phillips, who recently had a turn on Boston  Public and shows up next year in The Anarchist's Cookbook), driving across the state on their way home from college for spring break. On a secluded stretch of highway, a strange truck menaces them before roaring past. A few miles  down the road, they see the truck's driver dumping something that looks suspiciously like a body wrapped in a sheet down a large pipe, and after he drives away they stop to investigate. Complications ensue.The movie's probably not going to win any awards for its acting, writing, or cinematography, all of which fall into the slightly-above-average category.  But then, this isn't a movie with Oscar aspirations anyway. It's supposed to be a fast-paced slick little horror film, and that's what it is. Salva achieves the right balance between showing the nastiness and cutting away to let  suggestion do the work, and also uses the suggestion technique with his bad guy most of the time (something that hasn't been seen too much in films for a while). Add in a Miss Cleo-esque psychic (Patricia Belcher), a few hick cops who  actually break stereotype a few times, and a fun bad guy (Jonathan Breck, from the painfully bad film Spiders), and you've got a fine little flick. *** ",Jeepers Creepers
469104,"The play is there, or most of it. It is funny and light, though a little bit too spectacular. Shakespeare requires and deserves some simplicity in the special effects to make the text more effective. The magic of the play is nevertheless with us : imbroglios, funny sexual innuendo, puns, etc. And of course the end is the triple wedding ceremony with a fourth one (Titania and Oberon) behind and a fifth one that gives a tragic vision of what happens when parents or social circumstances refuse love and impose fake weddings : this leads to death and it is the play in the play that is made funny by the inability of the amateur actors to perform tragedy and also by their creativity in having a wall played by a man and the moon replaced by a lantern held by the man in the moon, or even by ythe replacement of a roaring lion by a barking and biting poodle. Yet I am afraid that the transposition of the play into the finishing 19th century is kind of naive and also adds too many gadgets of the  modern  world, especially bikes. The result is too anecdotic and the humor is no longer on the situation among the young people, but too much in the use, abuse and misuse of these bikes. It also makes the dilemma of getting married with the man chosen by the father or getting executed or becoming a nun kind of silly and out of place because mostly impossible at the end of the 19th century. What's more the two couples of young people are supposed to be sixteen or seventeen in the play, children in a way, and they are obviously adults, too old for the part, too old to be that naive and fresh. Finally I am afraid that turning Puck into an old man is not a very good idea. He has to be inexperienced and innocently sloppy in his work, hence he has to be a very young fairy.

4948,"Director Steven Spielberg's classic 1977 follow-up to &quot;Jaws,&quot; &quot;Close Encounters of the Third Kind&quot; stars Richard Dreyfuss as Roy Neary.  Neary's just an ordinary blue collar guy, a bit of a dreamer with a taste for Disney films and miniature railroads... until he witnesses a spectacular UFO appearance.  Haunted by mental images of a mountain he's never seen before, Neary risks his job, his marriage, his sanity and, eventually, his life to uncover what it all means.&quot;Close Encounters&quot; also marks the first appearance of the Spielberg formula.  You know, the messy suburban house, the mouthy kids, the whole &quot;just plain folks involved with something magical&quot; storyline.  And while he gets a lot of knocks, both justified and unjustified, for inflicting this on American movies in the 80s, Spielberg's use of documentary-like elements throughout (as the space people play some Burmuda Triangle-related tricks on what's apparently an international investigation team) and some funky casting (Teri Garr, French director Francois Truffaut, Bob Balaban and others) combine to lend this one a veracity some of his later films- and those of his imitators- sometimes lack.  This is a very fresh and original take on sci-fi subject matter, completely without physical violence (although there is some of the emotional kind).  Seeing decades later after so many heartless, bombastic, noise and light CGI fests, one can't help but admire Spielberg's ability to get to the emotional core of this material.Plus, it helps that the cutesy elements are kept to a minimum.  There's Melinda Dillon as a single mom whose oh-so-adorable-with-his-big-eyes kid gets kidnapped by the UFOs; the scene is played for scares, rather than laughs and it is genuinely terrifying.  Neary's kids are mostly unpleasant, and gone after the halfway point.  Dreyfuss downplays Neary's potential drippyness and plays up his frustration and rage as circumstances overwhelm him.  And Garr is very believable as Neary's doubtful wife; she keeps the character from becoming a one-note shrew.  You actually sympathize with her as she deals with what she thinks is her husband's selfish midlife crisis.The film ends with an amazing sequence of events and actually takes on an epic scope without losing the human element that makes it all so enjoyable.  This DVD release follows the format from the recent &quot;Jaws&quot; disk:  a gorgeous widescreen print, a few deleted scenes, some documentaries.

40997,"This is on my top three fantasy movies (the others being ""Conan the Barbarian"" and ""The Lord of the Rings""). The story is very original (about a race of immortals living among us in secrecy), the acting great (especially that of Sean Connery, who absolutely steals the show as the immortal mentor Ramirez), and the sword fighting scenes (though they seem a bit dated) are exciting and well-choreographed. It also features an A+ musical score by Michael Kamen, with some great Queen songs added in.The ""Immortal Edition"" DVD is fairly impressive. The sound and picture quality (especially picture) are kind of disappointing for something ""digitally mastered in THX"", but exceptional. The special features consist mainly of Queen music videos (infact, the second disc is nothing more than a CD with three Queen songs), but the talent bios are surprisingly long and interesting.

The film was one of the first true horror animated films for adults (mind you this came out before AKIRA so AKIRA was not the only great one to come out in the 80s) and it's as good as if it had been made into live action movie. The animation is amazing considering the time period and the screenplay is very layered. It makes a fairly subtle social commentery about social positions in terms of the &quot;common&quot; mixing with pure bloods which gives it an added depth which makes it even more compelling and makes it rise above the average anime film. The characters are all extremely well drawn. You can't help but feel empathy for Lamika, the Count's daughter. It has some great visuals in terms of the design of the demons and mosters and the design of landscapes and castles. The music is also great, very ominous, classical and heartfelt at times. This movie also creates a great anime superhero in D who deservedly had another movie created around him called VAMPIRE HUNTER D: BLOODLUST. Do not miss this movie.

279433,"Every actor or actress who has achieved success in Hollywood tends to have one film that is their ""signature"" part and in Greta Garbo's instance that role would have to be her tragic heroine Marguerite Gautier in the MGM classic ""Camille'.This film was, and is one of the benchmarks for how a classic movie should be put together. Flawless attention to detail, a great romantic story, exquisite performances by all concerned, a sumptous production and a fine literary source. All these elements successively combine here to make a screen masterpiece that has moved, charmed and entertained movie goers for generations. Indeed ""Camille"" is probably the best known and most often revived of all of Greta Garbo's great body of work which includes such masterpieces as , ""Grand Hotel"", ""Mata Hari"", ""Queen Christina"", and ""Ninotchka"".Greta Garbo, the mysterious, and reclusive MGM star here proves yet again what a stunning actress she can be when given material worthy of her talents. Based on the tragic story by Alexandre Dumas of ""The Lady of the Camellias"", ""Camille"" tells the story of Marguerite Gautier a famous 19th Century courtesan in Paris who lives by her beauty and the support of those men who can pay for it. The tragedy of her situation is that when life means very little to her and she finds herself slowly dying of consumption, she meets the love of her life the young and penniless gentlemen Armand who loves her for herself and not because of the charms she can offer. Armand offers her a life of genuine love and purpose which is missing in her gilded Parisian life among her superficial, pleasure loving friends and as the mistress of the grim and domineering Baron de Varville who views her as his personal plaything. Garbo instills in Marguerite just the right qualities of tragedy and humour to make her a well rounded believable character. Her scenes with the Baron have just the right elements of fear and loathing of the situation she finds herself in. Garbo, who earned yet another Oscar nomination for this role,  reached new dramatic heights here and it was a performance which she was justifibly proud of.""Camille"" has a wonderful array of performers who surround Garbo with some stunning work. Robert Taylor was a rising MGM star only just beginning his incredibly long career with the studio when he was handed the plum role of Armand. Previously acted on screen by non other than Rudolph Valentino, Taylor has been accused of a certain stiffness  in his playing. Reportedly he was terrified at the propect of working so closely with the legendary Garbo but it does not show in his performance. Certainly his work in the second half of the film is a major improvement when he experiences the frustrations of loving a woman who is being kept by a wealthy older man. His is a fine performance given the limitations of the role . Henry Daniell, a veteran character actor with many fine performances to his credit does a superb turn as the nasty Baron de Varville. He is excellent in his scenes with Garbo and projects an image of a cruel, self centred individual who regards Marguerite as his personal possession and who believes that money can get him everything he wants in life. The sterling cast also contains some wonderful work from Jessie Ralph another veteran character actress. She takes the sympathetic role of Nanine , Marguerite's devoted maid who stays with her devotedly through all the ups and downs of her life. Perhaps one of the most dazzling performances is turned in by Laura Hope Crews as Marguerite's superficial and self centred friend Prudence. Rarely has Crews, best known nowadays for playing Aunt Pittypat in ""Gone With The Wind"", given a more wonderful performance, she is in turn selfish, amusing, uncaring and infuriating and she dominates her scenes aided by her gaudy jewellery, over the top fashions and commanding presence . Lionel Barrymore also registers in the supporting role of Armand's concerned father Monsieur Duval and his most memorable scene occurs when he confronts Garbo's character with what she is potentially doing to Armand's chances of ever succesively making his way in life. Garbo's anguish at having to reject Armand for his own good despite the love she is feeling for him is heartrenching and gives Marguerite the mantle of a great tragic character. The interplay between Garbo and Barrymore, who had worked together before very effectively in ""Mata Hari"", is brilliant and goes a long way to explaining why these two performers are still considered stars 70 years after this production.Superbly directed by the legendary director George Cukor who worked so beautifully with Garbo on a number of occasions, ""Camille"" literally glows with the essence of a tragic romance in the making. Cukor was expert at extracting just the right amount of pathos and longing for other things from his players and  here he excels in one of his finest films. The production also benefits from MGM's great ability to bring the very best of talents to everything both in front of and behind the scenes. Adrian never surpassed himself than here in the stunning costumes he created for Garbo and the chief supporting players in this production. The film is so gorgeously costumed it makes viewing ""Camille"" a veritable eye feast but they tie in very carefully with what courtesans of that time wore and shows MGM's meticulous research into a time or period. Cedric Gibbon's sets almost rival his stunning work for ""Marie Antoniette"" a year later and have that unmistakably no expense spared MGM look about them.""Camille"" is the ultimate in romantic screen entertainment of the first order. For people wanting to sample Garbo's work for the first time this production is the best choice of all her films. I love it as an example of old style movie making at its very best with all areas of the production given total care and attention. It is a timeless story and for all lovers of romance this film will never fail to move you in its dilemma of searching for real love at the expense of ones creature comforts. I never fail to be impressed by ""Camille"" and you wont regret this trip into another time and place when love and position could mean everything in an individuals life.",N/A

The only person I can half stand in this movie is Sally Field, who I like and respect as an actress, but even her character wears thin.

The most dependable character in this movie for David is this toy bear.  The bear's animation is incredible, that is why this movie even earns 1 star.  However, the bear is almost creepily real and I expected his to turn into an evil Chuckie doll at anytime.

To explain too much is to rob the viewer of the power of the film.Following said 'red violin' through its history, it weaves together many tales in its path through the seeings of a tarot card reader back in the day of the violin's creator.

534830,"Many viewers were blown away by Cast Away, but I was not one of them. Much of the enjoyment of the movie depends on whether or not you are a Tom Hanks fan. I'm not all that impressed by him, and I assume that puts me in the minority. I believe the terms 'actor' and 'star' are not interchangeable. There have always been stars who are also consummate actors; however, one does not need a broad range of acting skills in order to be a star - or, for that matter, to win awards. Hanks is a star of the first magnitude. He can 'open' a picture because his legions of fans are going to flock to anything he is in. He likes to be in different kinds of movies, but, no matter what he is in, I am always aware that I am watching Tom Hanks.This time he plays Chuck Noland, a revved-up, stressed out manager at FedEx. He flies all over the world helping to make the package delivery giant ever more efficient. He is obsessed with time. It is Christmas, and he is about to ask Kelly [Helen Hunt] to marry him. Even this important moment is interrupted when he is called away for yet another flight to solve another company emergency. This time he doesn't make it. The plane crashes in the South Pacific, and Chuck, the only survivor, manages to make it to a deserted island. He is trapped in a place where time becomes irrelevant. Even his watch doesn't work. His survival tools are limited to a motley assortment of FedEx packages that washed ashore with him. Now he must learn whether or not the survival skills he honed in civilization will have any use in a place where civilization has no meaning.The production values are high in Cast Away. The plane crash, for example, is terrifyingly realistic and filled with first-rate special effects. Its the high point of the movie, but I don't think that's what its makers intended. The part where Noland is marooned on the island is well photographed and succeeds in capturing the character's utter aloneness and his descent into madness It is also a very long sequence, running nearly an hour and a half. After a while, there is only so much you can do with a character who has only a soccer ball to talk to. It was so long that it gave me time to think about how I was watching a very rich star doing a good impression of someone trapped on a deserted island. I began to picture Hank's big air-conditioned trailer and the mounds of gourmet food that lurked just out of camera range.Anyone who saw Cast Away's trailer knows whether Noland makes it off the island or not. For those who did not see it, I won't give away the ending. I will say that it is one the oddest and least inspired ones I've seen in a long time.",N/A

It deserves to be made into a film. But besides that, I don't think people realize how much we sorely need a truly good, original fantasy film these days. There have been so many attempts at it, and all have failed. Ron Howard failed with Willow. Rob Reiner failed with The Princess Bride. Steven Spielberg failed with Hook. Ridley Scott failed with Legend. Chris Colombus failed with Harry Potter. Now, finally, where all these filmmakers have failed, director Peter Jackson has succeeded.The Lord of the Rings trilogy is about a group of men, dwarves, elves, and hobbits who try to destroy the One Ring, a magical artifact forged by the dark lord Sauron as a way to channel his power and control Middle-Earth. It is from this simple premise that the film takes off, and what ensues is a very enjoyable, very epic tale.There is something to be said for &quot;using your imagination&quot; to conjure up images while reading a book, but nothing compares to the grand, unbelievably striking images and visuals that fill this adaptation. The direction is nothing short of amazing: the art direction and visual aspect of the film is some of the best I've ever seen. The settings and scenery are vast and you never see the same type of land twice. Valleys, mountains, snowy peaks, caves, forests, riverbeds, it's almost too much to keep track of. The sets are huge and varied, and the massive amount of detail in them reminds me of films like Gladiator. They have a great quality of consistency, as well: the architecture and style of buildings changes as you travel throughout Middle-Earth and enter places inhabited by different cultures. Seeing how each culture has its own style in everything from architecture to weaponry is a sight to behold; it makes this fantasy world real.The story has a soul, and what a soul it is, full of character development and themes of friendship, courage, sacrifice, and unlikely heroes. At its core, it is a study on one thing: power, as represented by the One Ring. Through all the characters and situations we encounter, a new facet of the responsibility of power is shown. Virtually every character in the story has to, at one point, make a decision regarding what they would do with the ring - no one is left unscathed, so to speak. It creates a blanketing, all-encompassing theme, one that isn't merely discussed here and there, but is rather brought up all the time as the story unfolds. The excitement is in watching each character's reaction to the notion of power in the form of that tiny little ring.Elijah Wood stands out as Frodo; his unnaturally large eyes project the innocence of Frodo's character. But the most impressive actors are Ian McKellan and Sean Bean, because of the different dimensions they bring to their roles. McKellan inhabits his role as Gandalf, and it's a wonder that, at one point, Sean Connery was once considered for this part. McKellan is a great actor, and here he not only projects majesty but also makes Gandalf a very human character at the same time, capable of great compassion and temptation as well. Sean Bean rivals this with his portrayal of Boromir, and it is such a crucial role too; he convinces the audience he is a good man, just one with a tragic flaw. It's probably the best performance of the film, and one of the best of the year.Action-wise, the first part of the film is made up of the Black Riders looking for the ring and chasing the hobbits, and it simply does not work. The Riders always, always appear where the hobbits are going. They're an omnipresence, and it ruins any suspense we may feel because we realize there's no point to the film having the hobbits try to hide from them -- they'll pop up anyway. There are also examples of very poor choices made during some of the chases, such as using extensive slow motion during a supposed fast-paced pursuit scene. Why the filmmakers decided on this, I don't know.However, the rest of the film contains much more entertaining and ambitious kinds of action. The prologue contains glimpses of the kind of colossal-scale battles we'll be treated to in the sequels, camera flying over the vast armies to give us a full sense of scale. The other major action sequences are much smaller-scale versions of this, but they work very effectively. The Mines of Moria action sequence is intense and claustrophobic and is the first time we get to see the members of the fellowship fight in battle. The finale is an extended sequence that contains violent, intense action (this is one of the most graphic PG-13 films I've ever seen) and very satisfying emotional thrills, as well, as certain characters reach the heights of their development.Despite some weak action as well as rushed editing and pacing problems in the first half, this is a great movie, a three hour long movie that I honestly felt was two hours long. It is, without a doubt, one of the most gorgeous films ever made. They have created Middle-Earth. Each frame of the movie is like a painting in itself, everything is set up so perfectly yet so naturally in the environments. Even the most mundane shots of a forest or a glade seem so perfect.FOTR is probably the best straight-out fantasy film I've ever had the privilege to see. Like Star Wars, it takes you away to a different world. To see FOTR is to see the heights to which cinematic visual artistry can reach. To see it is to become a living part of Middle-Earth. And we still have two more to go.",The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring
344768,"I am a huge fan of &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot; book by J.R.R. Tolkien and when I stumbled upon this animated film of the first two books of the trilogy, &quot;The Fellowship of the Ring&quot; and &quot;The Two Towers,&quot; I decided to watch it. Was I disappointed with the film? Absolutely not! Was the film perfect? No way. But did I thoroughly enjoy it? I sure did. This animated movie is very true to the books in certain places, but in other places the film is very off. It is a lot of fun to see your favorite characters from the books animated on screen and doing what they are doing.As I stated above, this film is based on the first two books of &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot; trilogy. The movie starts off with some history about the ring and how Gollum found it and Bilbo Baggins ended up retrieving it. Then the film switches to the present and Frodo, Bilbo's cousin, ends up with the ring. The ring is The One Ring that can rule all of Middle Earth. Then the first part of the movie details the beginning of the quest to destroy the ring. Then in &quot;The Two Towers&quot; film we see the battle at Helm's Deep. The ending of the film is a bit shakey but then I'll have to see the last movie in this cartoon duology to get the full story from the movies.This is a film that is very enjoyable but is still with its flaws. I'll start off with the good parts of the movie. The first part of the film, &quot;The Fellowship of the Ring&quot; part, is definitely the best as it is truest to the book. We see Bilbo's party at the beginning, the Inn at Bree, the Council of Elrond, and many other things that were in the book. The thing that was very vital yet missing was the Black Riders invading the Shire and trying to find the ring. I was wondering where this part of the movie was. Other good things about the film are the characters and just the feeling that the film gives off in certain places. In many places this film is warm and inviting, probably because of the atmosphere that the movie builds up.The bad parts are mostly that which was in &quot;The Two Towers&quot; part of the film. Most of what happened with Aragorn, Legolas, Gimli, Merry, and Pippin was true to the book as most of this part of the movie revolved around them. However, there was hardly any part of the quest of Frodo and Sam with Gollum. We only really see the two friends meet Gollum and start their quest to Mordor. If you have read the book you will remember that Frodo and Sam met a lot of men from Gondor and had a few adventures getting into the Dark Lord Sauron's city. This was the most missed part of the film. I have yet to see the other movie in this animated duology, but it is possible that this part will be there. I'm not too sure.The animation is mostly very good, but in certain places it looks that there were shots taken from live action movies and placed in an animated setting. This was a bit bothersome, but not too bad. Despite the flaws of this film it is still very enjoyable from fans of the books or anyone that seems interested in the movie. If you are a parent with young children that are familiar with the &quot;Lord of the Rings&quot; story and feel that the live action movie is a bit too violent or over their head, then I recommend this adaptation to you.Happy Reading!",N/A
582968,"Who could imagine a movie directed by Mr. Brett Ratner (Rush Hour), among all directors in the world, can be a subtle and moving experience?  There's no stereotypical situation.  Even the stock suburban Jersey characters are handled with normalcy.  Every situation is portrayed with realism and honesty.  The story line is solely based on Mr. Cage's character's view point.  It feels real because he's not immediately embracing his family lifestyle.  Through out the better part of the movie, he wanted to go back to his high-flying life as a single Wall Street player.  The change of heart is so subtle and skillfully handled by the screenwriters that you are totally convinced by the time he realized what he missed from his 'glimpsed' life with Miss Leoni and the kids.Miss Leoni is very believable in wardrobe and demeanor as an Ivy-league educated attorney turned into a Jersey wife.  She's not perfectly made-up, not a stick, and has a real glow and happiness as a wife and a mother (could it be the happy marriage with Mr. Duchovney and having two kids in real life?).  And the chemistry between Mr. Cage and Miss Leoni is palpable to say the least.Watching the movie and listening to Mr. Ratner and his producer's commentary really enforced my belief in making movies with passion.  The passion expressed by Mr. Ratner and the producer was so heart-felt, it gives me hope for greater things to come from them.To me the realness of this movie is in its ending.  Mr. Cage, after his blissful 'glimpse' of what could have been, tried to track down Miss Leoni in real life, who is a successful attorney also on a fast track, to give the love they once shared one more try (did I spoil the movie by revealing this?).  Like what the filmmakers said in the making-of documentary, Mr. Cage only asked Miss Leoni for a cup of coffee and they left the audience there imagining the possible outcomes.  They, as filmmakers, did not try to turn this story into a fairy tale.  Today's movie goers are sophisticated enough to know when a story is manipulative or not.  :)It may be too late for Mr. Cage and Miss Leoni's characters to develop a life together like in Mr. Cage's glimpse.  But it's never too late for us viewers to take stock of our life and determine what really matters.",N/A

681314,"Any resemblance to the Daniel Clowes' graphic novel upon which 'Ghost World' is based is purely cosmetic. The quiet essence of teenage angst that Clowes captured so brilliantly in his monochromatic drawings is lost somewhere in the translation.Not that the movie can't be assused of not trying...director Zwigoff just tries so hard he almost belittles his audience's intelligence. Its as though he used Clowes' basic characterization and plot structure to present his own frustrations with society, art, and cinema. Zwigoff uses the relationship between characters as a foil to the frustration of the creative individual in such a regimented market-driven country. I don't have issue with this per se...it just follows the trappings of the 'American Beauty' syndrome: soulful frustrated characters drifting through mediocrity with convenient typical ultra-liberal Hollywood plot twists.Parodied situations in this vein are throughout 'Ghost World'. In the end, the two main characters are so good-looking, you have to wonder if they would really be so angst-ridden. It eventually gets so repetative, it borders on the tedious towards its own anticlimactic conclusion.",N/A

564695,"&quot;Selma, Lord, Selma&quot; fills an important niche by telling a story of the Civil Rights Movement in a manner that is accessible to upper elementary students (and older). The characters and situations are believable, and the story is told from the perspecive of a young--almost 12 years old--African-American girl who got involved after writing a report on Rev. Martin Luther King, Jr.While this film portrays the harshness of the situation, including two deaths, it is not graphic or gratutitous. I personally appreciated the way the non-violent Civil Rights movement of Rev. King and his followers was based on their Christian beliefs. The film is not preachy, but the religious context of the movement is realistically portrayed.As the school librarian, I will be recommending this video to teachers in our elementary school as an option for the Martin Luther King holiday.","Selma, Lord, Selma VHS"
319384,"As you probably already know, this film concerns the blatantly unfair trail and conviction of Leonard Peltier, for the alleged crime of murdering two FBI agents at the Pine Ridge Reservation in 1975. The documentary begins by putting the incident in its proper perspective by showing that the Pine Ridge Reservation, at that time, had one of the highest per capita murder rates in the entire US, with the vast majority of those crimes, even today, still filed as ""unsolved"" (Check out Ward Churchill's ""Indians are Us"" and Agents of Repression for a detailed account of the killings in question). In fact, from 1973 to 1976 at least 69 Aim members and supporters were murdered&#65533;and not one person was ever convicted, or even investigated, for these brutally horrific crimes. Why were these deaths not investigated you may ask. It is because the victims were primarily American Indians involved with AIM who were actively involved in the struggle to retain the lands lawfully granted to them in the Fort Laramie Treaty of 1868 against the federal gov't and the corrupt, unelected BIA administration of Dick Wilson. Many have openly claimed that Wilson and his so-called ""goon squad"" were responsible for these killings, but no investigation was ever conducted by State law enforcement officials or by the FBI; and yet the incident that led to the shooting that left two agents and one Indian dead, centered around an investigation concerning a pair of STOLEN COWBOY BOOTS. You can draw your own conclusions from that.Although three men were originally charged with the murder of the agents in a separate trial preceding Peltier&#65533;s illegal extradition from Canada, the first two defendants were determined to be not guilty of all charges&#65533;their acts viewed as self defense. After this embarrassment the FBI decided that Peltier would be convicted at all costs and set about the task of &#65533;constructing&#65533; a case against him. After a trial marred by official perjury, witness intimidation and clearly manufactured evidence, Leonard Peltier alone was convicted, but then, only after the original judge was inexplicably removed from the case and replaced with one ""friendly"" to the FBI by a prejudiced jury of his &#65533;white&#65533; peers. This film shows the disturbing details surrounding how Peltier was ultimately convicted by this court presided over by an obviously prejudiced judge and jury on what amounts to a mountain of manufactured evidence, witness tampering, and lies.As the film and the FBI's own evidence shows there is absolutely no proof that has not been exposed as fraud, that links Peltier to the murder weapon or the red van (Peltier drove a pickup truck) that the agents reportedly followed onto the reservation. The FBI goes so far as to argue that &#65533;people in this part of the country call a pickup truck a van and vice versa&#65533;&#65533;to explain just one glaring inconsistency in the government&#65533;s case. The FBI's own statements are filled with inconsistencies and outright falsehoods, which resulted in the Federal Judge Edward McManus of the first trial harshly rebuking them for their shameful, reckless and unlawful behavior. In the video the FBI spokesman's dishonesty is clearly, if not painfully, apparent. Simply watch this video and decide for yourself. You will be surprised and certainly appalled by what you see.&#65533;Incident at Oglala&#65533; is a vitally important document detailing a form of repression and cultural genocide that has continued, although in differing forms, since the arrival of Columbus, against Native Americans. The Dali Lama, Nelson Mandela, Bishop Desmond Tutu, The European Parliament and Amnesty International have all urged that executive Clemency be granted to Peltier based on the facts of this case and the massive miscarriage of justice that it represents. This important film is a must see for anyone who cares about the ideals of freedom and justice in this country and the shameful realities that, all too often, hide behind those noble-sounding terms. For as long as men like Leonard Peltier and Mumia Abul-Jamal remain imprisoned, none of us are completely safe from the same treatment.Mitakuye Iyasin!",N/A
535699,"This film is a perfect thriller for our times.  The plot is about a computer company, NURV, run by a Bill Gates-like CEO, Gary Winston (Tim Robbins), who is perfect for the part.

Enter the psychopathic vampire Spike (James Marsters), a.k.a. ""William the Bloody,"" and his demented paramour Drusilla (Juliet Landau), to rearrange the pecking order and initiate a violent ongoing vendetta against the Slayer.  Spike has two Slayer kills already to his credit, and is eager for a third; mad Drusilla, before the season is out, will bag one of her own to match him.The Bonnie-and-Clyde vampire duo were created by Buffy's great love, Angel, before his soul was restored  -  when he was known as Angelus, the Scourge of Europe.  With classic hubris, Buffy unknowingly sows the seeds of her own psyche's doom by consummating her love with Angel, costing him his regained soul and reverting him to the exceedingly violent killer he once was.  The act ends up costing her the lives of many near and dear loved ones  -  and pits her in a life-and-death apocalyptic struggle that will force her to lose her greatest love...or the world, itself.This was the greatest tear-jerker season of Buffy, and  -  along with the third season  -  its highest dramatic peak.  The melodrama is intense, the tragedy even more so.  The story arc is very impressively handled, focusing first on Buffy's conflict with Spike and Drusilla, and the two killer vampires' newfound conflict with their sire and former mentor in evil, Angel, and then lethally tipping the scale with Angel's fall from grace and reunion with the diabolical duo.New loves are to be found, along with new cast members, most notably Seth Green as Oz, Willow's lycanthropically cursed boyfriend.

587319,"If ever a storyteller was irresistibly drawn toward the cinema and its camera's all-seeing eye, that person would be David Lynch.  ""Mulholland Drive"" uses the camera as an omniscient eye into the world of Hollywood filmmaking, utilizing the talents of three remarkable performers, Laura Elena Harring, Naomi Watts and Justin Theroux.The film begins with Harring helplessly wandering the streets of Hollywood after a collision occurs on Mulholland Drive with the limousine in which she was riding, causing an explosion, after which she barely escapes with her life.  Lynch shrewdly uses the magnificent contours of Harring's face, accenting her perfectly sloped cheekbones, to achieve maximum benefit from a purposeful camera.  Laura Elena was the first Hispanic ever to win the Miss U.S.A. contest, after which she became a countess by marrying into the prominent Bismarck family.  At that point she began studying drama in London.  Her marriage ended and she pursued her film career vigorously, with Lynch providing her with a solid breakthrough performance.Harring interacts in the film with the lovely blonde actress who won Breakthrough Performance of the Year honors from the National Film Board of Review resulting from her sterling effort in ""Mulholland Drive.""  Naomi Watts was born in England and raised in Australia.  After a decade of fervent effort to build a film career Lynch provided her with this solid break, with which she made good.  When Harring, unable to remember anything, occupies Watts' apartment shortly before her arrival by plane from Canada, the understanding young blonde woman immediately befriends her, inviting her to move in with her.  Watts, whose aunt, a famous actress, is the apartment's occupant, and is letting her use it while she is making a film in Canada, immediately assists Harring in seeking to uncover the mystery associated with her memory loss.In the manner of Lynch, the film develops into a series of dramatic situations in which the viewer is confronted with the task of separating a dreamworld of illusion from reality.  As the film develops we learn that Watts and Harring are vying for the same starring role in a major film.Justin Theroux enters the mix as a confused director.  Lynch is to be credited for never depicting Theroux as a raving lunatic, but rather someone who launches into bizarre behavior in a low key manner, rendering the character more uniquely effective.  Theroux remains outwardly calm no matter what happens, even after he is forcibly thrown out of his own Hollywood canyon home by the pool cleaner he finds in bed with his wife.By the film's end Harring is enchanting everyone, male and female.  At one point Watts becomes jealous over her attention, along with her competition for a role she wants in the film Theroux is directing.  Theroux has been warned by the gangster element financially backing the film that he is duty bound to put Watts in the starring female role, leading to conflict.One of the film's zaniest characters is a professional hit man with the efficiency level of Inspector Clousseau at his daffiest.  He is compelled to eliminate large numbers of people to cover up his staggering inefficiency.Playing the role of the shrewd ""You can't fool me"" landlady of the apartment building where Watts and Harring stay is veteran Ann Miller, who starred in MGM musicals in the fifties.  She immediately sees through the flimsy explanation provided by Watts to justify Harring staying with her.  At one point the relationship between the two beautiful young women heats up into an erotic love sequence captured beautifully by Lynch's all-seeing camera.",Mulholland Drive
701728,"First of all, I have to point out that I am a fan of the original twenty-six episode series, which I consider to be an absolutely stunning production and story, with a slightly disjointed ending.That said, I admittedly watched this with an existing bias.As a movie in its own right, this is very nice; compared to the original series it was adapted from, it's a bit of a let down. The production standards were excellent (after all, it appears to use the same cast and crew as the original series), but to somebody who had already experienced the richness of the original, the retelling was rather abrupt.In my opinion, it is best to consider this to be an alternative history type of tale, that happens to feature many of the same characters. The storyline only bears a superficial resemblance to that of the original, but it's a decent storyline in its own right. If I had seen this before watching the series, I would probably have considered it a 4 of 5 overall.Character designs are nice, and the animation is excellent. The sound quality seems to be very good, but they don't seem to be trying for the immersive audio experience of the series. I cannot comment on the quality of the dub work (didn't listen to it) but considering the company, it's probably decent. Acting on the Japanese audio is excellent, and, if I'm recalling names correctly, features the same cast as the series. The subtitles are nicely legible, although I was watching it on a 31&quot; display using an S-Video hookup.I can't comment on the extra features available, as I've only seen a rental edition (no bonus disc included), but the extra features on the main disc are minimal.",N/A

129753,"""Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade"" disappoints, for its inability to construct a believable action scene.  Who'd get taken in by this blatant cartoonery?  I, frankly, miss the stark realism and gritty humanism of ""Raiders of the Lost Ark"" and ""The Temple of Doom"".  What?  They were live-action cartoons too?  Well, that changes everything, then, doesn't it?Kidding aside, you shouldn't ever go into an Indiana Jones movie expecting credible action.  And ""The Last Crusade"" has the least credible, but at times most fun, action of any in the series.  Watch as Indy, armed only with a horse and the strap from his bag, manages to outrun and outgun a German tank.  Later in the sequence, we get a moment that for me defines the ethos Spielberg and Lucas have built for this series.  Indiana is wrestling with some Nazis on the tank.  The tank moves slowly towards a cliff.  Instead of jumping off the tank at the last minute, leaving the baddies to tumble to their doom, Indy appears to go over the cliff with them.  His entourage, which includes his stoic father, rushes to the side of the cliff just in time to see the tank hit bottom and explode.  Somber faces all around.  Just as they say their goodbyes, the camera cuts to a hand appearing by the cliff's edge, out of their view.  It's Indy!  He's alive!  After a quick moment to brush himself off, he joins his friends to see what the fuss is about.  His father does a pitch-perfect double-take upon noticing him, then explodes in joyous tears.  The scene ends with Indy, collapsed in exhaustion, surprised when his fedora, thought lost in the wreckage, tumbles into his lap.  It's a perfect blend of classic Saturday matinee hokiness with a dollop of contemporary self-awareness.  The filmmakers know that Indy's invincible.  The actors know it.  And most importantly, the audience knows it.  But for a brief moment, the film has us going.  Then it allows us to laugh at our own gullibility.Besides mocking the genre pictures from whence it came, ""The Last Crusade"" spends a lot of time winking and nudging about its own past.  The character, by this point in the trilogy, has a lot of history, and much of it is playfully referenced here.  One key moment finds Indy and his current Jones girl, Elsa, exploring the catacombs underneath a Venetian library.  Intricate hieroglyphics adorn the walls.  One in particular looks like a glowing golden box.  Elsa points it out and asks, ""What's this one?""  ""The Ark of the Covenant,"" says Indy.  ""Are you sure?"" she confirms, perfectly setting up his deadpan reply: ""Pretty sure.""  More explicitly is the infamous opening sequence, starring River Phoenix as Young Indiana.  In it we see, during one quick trip across a Circus train, the origins of Indy's fedora, his whip, his fear of snakes, and his knack for adventure.  Even though I have some trouble believing that the fragile and feline Phoenix will grow up to be the rugged and rough Harrison Ford, he has enough fun during the sequence to make my qualms disappear.Which leads me to the casting of Indy's father.  It might seem far-fetched to have the decidedly Midwestern Ford fathered by Sean Connery.  But like Phoenix, Connery has enough fun here to make you forget the differences in their accents.  You'll be won over by the twinkle in his eye and the bounce in his step.  The movie relies heavily on their chemistry, and at this task it does not fail.  Connery, who provided the model for Indiana Jones in the first place (what is Indiana Jones if not an archaeological James Bond?), plays against type: he's a bookworm.  Armed with his tweed jacket and neat bow-tie, he's hardly the Jones patriarch you were expecting.  Henry Jones is a Mr. Magoo-type character, accidentally finding ways of saving the day, when his more daring son can't.  In ""The Last Crusade"", Connery proves, through the power of his towering charisma and impeccable comedic timing, why he's still a star, some forty years after ""Dr. No"".Not so successful a casting choice is Alison Doody.  Her Elsa continues the tradition of Indy's leading women getting better and better looking, while being played by poorer and poorer actresses.  From Karen Allen, to Kate Capshaw, to a new high/low.  If this trend continues, I expect to see Denise Richards in ""Indy IV"".  True, you understand why the shallowness in Indy's character would find her appealing, but Doody brings little more than wooden line readings to the movie.While not as 'important' a movie as others in his oeuvre, ""The Last Crusade"" once again shows how adept Steven Spielberg is at manipulating an audience into high gear.  The action sequences are economical and exciting, the visual jokes work like a charm every time, and the special effects, while already dated, work in a cheesy/kitschy kind of way.  On top of all this, Spielberg throws in more Nazi imagery here than in any of his other movies, including ""Schindler's List"".  When Indy finds himself face-to-face with Hitler, in one of the film's best jokes, Spielberg doesn't miss the opportunity for some fun at the fuhrer's expense.The ending, much-maligned, does well servicing the story.  We've been leading up to finding the Holy Grail, but it's not really an important part of the story, just an excuse for mild adventures.  After all, the filmmakers didn't even bother to come up with a menacing villain to stand in the Jones' way.  What we do get is a hubristic stooge, whose obsessiveness is burning so intensely, it's obvious to everyone but him that it will be his downfall.  The ending provides some suspenseful moments, gives all the characters credible reasons for doing what they have to do to move the story along, and ties up all the loose ends.  It's a fine way to wrap up another fun entry in the Indiana Jones series.",N/A

45216,"First of all I thought the acting was good!I have a few questions about the content.I'll put that another way.I would like to see a movie that might address why the allies did not know about these camps until the Allies entered Germany.Allied bombers had no problems locating German factories and other military and civillian targets, but I never heard of prisoner of war camps or concentation camps being bombed-explain that-maybe the pilots were very lucky!Also I do not understand how people could be killed only for their religious beliefs but allied prisoners who were killing your countrymen were taken prisoner and treated according to some war rules!That doesn't make sense to me.I do not doubt nor defend any justice in the killing of any Jewish people in any way, that was horrible!I just have some questions.I will say that my mother and her family were on the receiving end of allied bombing thank God it wasn't in Dresden or Hamburg! My father is post war U.S. soldier and mother postwar West German!She accepts that as war and has been flying a U.S.flag long before 9-11-01 happened.I guess my review drifted of course abit,the movie and actors were great but alot of innocent people died in that war,not just one group!Also Hollywood sometimes gets critisized for violence but rarely gets praise they sometimes deserve,people have been killing each other long before Hollywood was around,sometimes mankind can be worse than animals to each other and over and over again.

709051,"Unlike some people I really enjoyed the HELLRAISER sequel that preceeded this one, INFERNO. It stuck more to the original concept (as in the original novel) than any of the other sequels, and actually had a new twist and a PLOT which is more than I can say for HELL ON EARTH (radio shack cenobites...ugg) and the idiotic, predictable BLOODLINE (Pinhead in Space, just like the stupid Leprechaun).So after the series had been so greatly revived by part 5, I hoped, though doubted, that part 6 might be halfway watchable.Firstly this movie is a rip-off of ANGEL HEART and JACOB'S LADDER. Secondly, it does the old ""it was only a dream"" trick every five minutes to the point where you cannot follow the plot at all. The only redemable moment is the ending which is commendable but isn't worth waiting for through the entirety of the boring, lame and redundant film.Pass on this.The interesting thing is that the people who own the rights to this series also own the rights to HALLOWEEN (or did). So if JASON VRS. FREDDY ever comes out and makes any profit, which it will no matter how campy it will doubtlessly be, then we will know whom Pinhead will eventually come face to face with. After that we can look forward to a reprise of the old monster movies like KING KONG VRS. GODZILLA which plagued the late fiftes and early sixties. Every horror movie icon will come back to fight another (which would also make for a great Playstaion 2 fighting game). THE FLY will fight LEATHERFACE. CHUCKY VRS. LEPRECHUAN is inevitable. THE THING could show up at SLEEPAWAY CAMP. Personally, I think once a franchise has reached up to part seven or, worse yet part 10 like FRIDAY THE 13TH, there is little left to do but go campy or call it quits. FREDDY went campy (super campy) by the first sequel. He knew what was up. Chucky and Leprechaun followed his lead, and Jason took his sweet time but he made it. Unless Hollywood finally lets PINHEAD and MYERS and the other greats finally rest in peace, then eventually they will be doomed to cinematic cheese. HALLOWEEN 8 (with Busta and Tyra) is an alarming warning of this.Let's hope they let PINHEAD maintain his dignity and throw in the towel. Some horror icons are too magnificent to go cheesy.

440868,"Don't get me wrong -- I'm a total Evil Deadhed all the way through. I was just disappointed in the features that should have been a bang-zoom kind of explosion that ended up being some type of Roman candles. Okay, but not what I was expecting.First the good -- the cover is excellent. Kind of this squishy latex foam (stinky) cover to simulate human skin -- it's also chock full of Tom Sullivan's drawing. Artistically, pretty cool but not great to stack with your DVDs.FANanalysis, the documentary by Bruce Campbell was great. Bruce takes Evil DeadHeads behind the scenes at conventions and offers an intimate portrayal of himself interacting. Although it was very short (23 minutes) I thoroughly enjoyed watching this little gem of an addition to this DVD. A must-see.The sound and picture of the Evil Dead is outstanding. Considering this was a cheaply made film, MAN did they clean everything up and clarify all the details of the movie. Probably the best I've seen.Plus, there are some Easter Eggs in this DVD. At main menu:Egg 1: go to EXTRAS highlight ""trailer"" > arrow left that should highlight a fish, click it (this will play a screen test for the animation of one of the zombies)Egg 2: at EXTRAS click ""more"" highlight ""fanalysis"" > arrow leftthat will highlight a skull, click it (this features a short film of a discussion of Evil Dead. Robert Tapert and the actresses who play Linda and Shelly discuss a little about what went on during the filming. Robert briefly mentions his wife &lt;who is the actress who plays Xena for those of you who didn't know> Also talks a bit about their next film collaboration that could be the 4th Evil Dead)Now, the not-so-great. Well, unfortunately, the prequel ""Within the Woods"" was apparently pulled by some yahoo guy at the last minute at Columbia. Why, we don't know but I know a number of fans were really ticked about this. Don't despair! Surf the web and you'll find ways of getting a bootleg --albeit a crappy copy, but it's out there. And you have GOT to see it -- you will see all the inspiration for Evil Dead including the parts that ended up transferring over to the next two flicks.The commentary was cut into two sections: Bruce by himself and Rob Tapert and Sam Raimi on the other. If you have the Evil Dead 2 special edition, you'd appreciate the commentary for the way they kid each other. Bruce is great with technical details but I think they should have had him comment with Sam and Rob. Sam has a tendency to get into his flicks and go quiet so there were long pauses despite the fact Rob was with him. They should have had the three of them together for one commentary as it is too much fun listening to them all kid each other and laugh about how they pulled Evil Dead off. At one point, Rob questions why they separated them for the commentaries (which tells me it wasn't their idea) and I missed their friendly bantering.The outtakes section was interesting, but boring. I got the impression it was them messing up and laughing, but alas, it was merely unused takes and footage. Not bad, but probably interesting for die-hard fans only.Overall, it's a good DVD, but incomplete. I get the impression that ""Within the Woods"" is thought of by the studios as a money-maker which might be why they pulled it at the last second. If this is apparent, then hopefully the hesitant studios will realize that the Dead series is a money maker and offer the funds for a new flick.Good for die-hard fans, decent collectable.",Evil Dead VHS

Now then, here's where Star Trek III - Special Edition will have a special place in my heart for some time.Back in the Christmas season of 1986, I got my first VCR along with 2 commericially recorded movies.  One of these movies was Star Trek III.  I requested it because I had missed it in the theaters and as Trek fans know, 1986 was the release year for Star Trek IV.  And since Star Trek II thru IV form what is commonly known by Trek fans as the ""Genesis Trilogy"", I had missed the middle movie, so I wanted to catch up.Now then, fast forward to Christmas 2001.

697753,"Wes Anderson's third film, ""The Royal Tenenbaums,"" is nothing short of amazing and was easily the best film of 2001. Why it wasn't nominated for more than Best Original Screenplay at this year's Oscars is beyond me. The same went for his sophomore effort (and what I feel is his best film of the three) ""Rushmore.""One of many of Anderson's gifts lies in his appreciation of and ability to identify deadpan humor. My three favorite moments of the film are when Richie suffers a breakdown at his tennis match and tosses his racquet at the returned ball he lightly served over the net in the first place, when Chas holds a mock fire drill and tells his boys that they all would have died, including their dog, because it took them four and a half minutes to get out of the house, and when Raleigh St. Clair replies to the question ""Can the boy tell time?"" with ""Heavens, no.""He also has the uncanny ability of accompanying his films with the perfect music (though he has been ostracized for not including certain songs that appear in his films on the actual soundtrack.) He did it in ""Rushmore"" with British Invasion songs and he doesn't falter here. The absolute best moment of the film (in a depressing, psychotic kind of way) is when Richie attempts to kill himself by slicing his wrists. The reason for this wholly rests on the fact that the entire montage was accompanied by Elliot Smith's haunting song ""Needle in the Hay.""The other reason Anderson gets good marks is because of the fabulous ensemble cast. Gene Hackman, Anjelica Huston, Danny Glover, Gwyneth Paltrow, Bill Murray, Ben Stiller, Owen Wilson and Luke Wilson are all at their best here.Kudos to everyone involved in this film; it is sure to gain classic status years from now.

91884,"Am I missing something?  Please write and tell me if I am, because I can't understand why people admire this movie.  As far as I can tell, this is what happens in ""A Time To Kill"": Carl Lee's daughter is raped and left for dead, and her white tormentors are captured.  Before they face trial, Carl kills them.  Why?  They would not be convicted, because as we all know a white southern jury couldn't possibly set aside its racism.  Carl is then acquitted by a white southern jury that sets aside its racism.  The film urges us to celebrate this verdict as some kind of race-relations watershed.  But beneath the back-slapping, soaring music and soft focus, the take home message is this: ""There is a time to kill.  If you think the justice system won't give you justice, then revenge killing is a noble option.""  Not only is this one of most appallingly idiotic dictums ever conceived, it betrays an appreciation of the justice system which is, at best, infantile.Let's apply a little common sense here.  What the white rapists did was wrong, and they should be punished for it.  What the black father did was wrong, and he should be punished for it, too.  Cases closed.  Yes, we can empathize with Carl.  Yes, put in the same position we might even do the same thing ourselves.  No, that doesn't make it right.  Even if you think Carl was rightly acquitted, the film defeats its own argument: the fact that Jake Brigance gets a white jury to recognise and set aside its inherent racism (""now imagine she's white"") demonstrates that Carl's fears were unjustified.  There was no need to take the law into his own hands after all - a black man can get justice from a white court.  However, I think a more realistic interpretation of the outcome is that a dumb jury can be sweet-talked by a pretty-boy lawyer into acquitting a guilty man they feel sorry for.  And what kind of 'justice' is that?  Don't ask screenwriter Akiva Goldsman - this is just another one of his sci-fi scripts.  Nor director Joel Schumacher - here, as in his equally insulting ""Batman"" films, he seems more interested in visually molesting his male star than in telling a decent story, and clearly spent most of his time contriving ways to get Matthew McConaughey's shirt off or setting up lingering butt shots.This film was pitched as an exciting suspense-thriller, nicely cast with a mix of heavy-weights and newcomers, and having the guts to explore some serious social and moral issues. For me, it's a vile and contemptible little film peddling an equally repulsive morality.  What the hell Spacey, Bullock and the Sutherlands are doing here is beyond me.  It's a blot on all their resumes.  Go back to your old job as a window dresser, Joel.  On the evidence of this film, pretty and pretentious facades are what you're best at.",N/A

150522,"Miller and Mallory, the heroes of ""The Guns of Navarone"" are back, sort of.  We knew them as Peck and Niven, but little else but those two characters connects this movie with the 60's classic.  Here, Mallory (Robert Shaw) and Miller (Ed Fox)hitch a ride with an American special forces team into war-torn Yugoslavia on a mission to assassinate a turncoat partisan who is betraying Tito's forces to the Nazis.  Force-10, led by Col. Applebee (Harrison Ford), has its own mission and its own ways of getting into the battle zone - neither of which they discuss with Malliry or Miller.  On their way to Yugoslavia (actually, on their way to getting their ride to Yugoslavia) the crew picks up Weaver (Carl Weathers) a sergeant on his way to the stockade.  Things don't go as planned - even for Force-10's exceptionally pessimistic planning.  Mallory and Applebee soon find themselves forced to discuss each other's secret mission and find themselves dependent on each other to carry it out.This was a sort of good movie - ironically it would do better if we didn't think it had anything to do with the original ""Navarone"".  What otherwise kills the flick is that there's no central villain - Richard Kiel plays a monstrous Chetnick who baits Carl Wethers and the rest of us, but that's about all.  There's a high-ranking Nazi who puts in an early appearance and an almost as fast exit.  The biggest disappointment is the plot - save the partisans.  The partisan commander's antipathy to his Anglo-American allies stems from his suspicion that they consider his war theater a backwater, an idea the script does little to contradict.  Still, the flick is definitely worth a look - I actually enjoyed it, especially how it tries to look and sound like a war movie made a decade earlier, rousing music and all.",N/A

664204,"&quot;How the Grinch Stole Christmas&quot; is a classic story by the master storyteller Dr. Seuss.  It has an anti-commercialist message, but isn't overly preachy.  This, however, is disgusting.  It's hypocritical in the way that it was over-commercialized, and the plot totally strays from the book.  In an attempt to lengthen the book's plot into a two-hour movie, it was mutilated and convoluted.

339146,"It's true what critics say.  Nothing But Trouble isn't Chevy Chase's, John Candy's, and Dan Aykroyd's best comedy though it still entertains.  It truly is a lot like Beetlejuice though the ending is horrible.  Chevy Chase stars as Chris, a stock market whiz and millionaire who wants to go to Atlantic City with investment lawyer Demi Moore.  However, one small violation (Candy plays the cop who brings them in) leads them to Valikenvania, a whole place filled with wrecked yards and a big unclean mansion.  In there theyfind the 106 year old Alvin Valkenheiser (Aykroyd), a judge with a extreme grudge for bankers (he thinks Chase is a banker) and has ways to punish people for breaking the law.  And as Moore and Chase run through booby traps and rooms, they meet up with several ugly-looking characters (especially those two dirty fat man who Aykroyd plays).  John Candy also has another role as Valkenheiser's daughter (that's right, he has a girly part).  The script is not Academy-Award deserving but it's not the worst script you've ever read.  It's not a complete all star cast but who cares.  Aykroyd looks horrible in the movie and though some things are way too unbelievable, I thought it was an an entertaining and creepy movie with a little comedic twist thrown in.  You should probably rent it first before you buy it.  This is the kind of movie that'll be boring the fourth or fifth time you watch it.",N/A

200257,"Walter Matthau and Joe Don Baker, two actors I can usually take or leave, are brilliant as evenly matched adversaries with very different styles in director Don Siegel's marvelously entertaining thriller. Matthau is Varrick, a rumpled but very resourceful hustler whose take from a small town bank heist turns out to be laundered Mafia money. Baker is the glib, no-nonsense gorilla hired to recover the bucks. Siegel makes flawless use of Southwestern locales as his stars engage in a fascinating game of cat and mouse that has the brutish Baker (he insults friendly whores, abuses a wheelchair-bound gun merchant and smacks sexy photographer Sheree North around before bedding her) always just a baby step behind the ingenuity of Matthau's likeable anti-hero. The junk yard-set climax, a masterfully choreographed battle pitting Matthau's crop-duster against Baker's car, is pure, edge of your seat Siegel. Who wins? Suffice to say, the ending packs one wallop of a surprise, but you will NOT be disappointed. Very highly recommended.",N/A

Finally, after the all this time, Tomino decided it was time for Amuro and Char's last mission in a full-length Gundam movie. The fans went wild.The story takes off in the year UC 0093. Without any explanation at this time, Char is now the leader of Neo Zeon and plans to send the Earth into a nuclear winter as well as defeat his long-time nemesis, Amuro. But with many old and new characters mixed up in this battle, it won't be pretty.CHARACTERSAmuro: Returning to the battlefield, now being a responsible adult.Char: Conferming his hatred when on Earth, he is the new leader of Neo Zeon.Bright Noa: The former captain of the White Base is still in action.Mirai: The wife of Bright Noa now and mother of two children.Hathaway: Bright's son who ventures out into space.Quess: A cocky rich daughter who runs off with Neo Zeon.Gyunei: Char's pupil with Newtype abilities.Cameron: Mirai's ex-fiance who is now works for the economy.Lalah Sune: Despite being dead, her ghost still haunts the dreams of Amuro and Char.The animation for a 1980's film is top notch. The funnels moves about at an insane pace battling each other across the screen. Its a marvel to witness. What this film tried to do was cram as much content and action as it could into two hours and they did a great job at that. The original voice actors from the English version of the TV series make their debut once again. They all do a relatively good job and are almost on par with the Japanese cast.The audio is quite impressive as well. You get both language tracks in either 2.0 or 5.1 Dolby. An interesting note is that the Japanese track has not been remixed as it was with the three Gundam movies. This marks as the first Tomino Gundam feature not to have been tampered with so go nuts. Sadly, the English track falls back on all those sounds you heard in the remix versions of Gundam.The extras hold up pretty well, but aren't really groundbreaking. There are two theatrical trailers for the movie, but without it being in widescreen form, you feel you've lost something. The other extra is the Gundam model music video which shows how models are put into production. Not all that fun, but still informative. The last extra is a filmography of all of Tomino's works which is nice if you haven't seen it yet.Overall, Char's Counterattack ended up being everything I hoped it would. Raging Newtypes battling each other furiously in mobile suits. I couldn't ask for better than this.",N/A

Maybe he acts with conviction because the bouncer job was already taken and this was it. Maybe he acts with conviction because those Eastern European payments may devalue before the film is finished.

665603,"Whenever you think of the Carry On films you immediatley think of the likes of Sid James, Kenneth Williams, Joan Sims, Charles Hawtrey, Hattie Jaques, Barbara Windsor etc. This British film series is now something of a much-loved institution. Always savaged by critics for its cheap puns and almost stereotypical performances, the films can be more accuratley described as cheap and cheerful. Not exactly being Shakespeare but the series did come up with some genuinley fine blends of comedy - Up The Kyber (1968), Camping (1969) and Cleo (1964) immediatley spring to mind.Now some of these films are over 40 years old and to celebrate their timeless appeal, The Carry On Collection comprises of the first 12 entries out of the 31 Carry On films made with the bonus of Thats Carry On. Sergeant (1958) initially set the ball rolling and is entertaining at that whilst Nurse (1959) catapulted the series into blockbuster success where it topped the U.S Box office Charts and ran in some cinemas for over two and a half years! Teacher (1959) is a gentle, old-fashioned comedy that still raises a smile whilst Constable (1959) marks a turning point in the series as its the first to feature Sid James - a much valued regular in the series. Regardless (1960) is a passable comedy but lacks direction in some ways with a series of sketches loosley tied in together with the link of the Helping Hands agency, whilst Carry On Cruising (1962) saw the series transferred into colour. Carry On Cabby (1963) is amongst the finest early entries in the series with wonderful performances from Sid James and Hattie Jaques, whilst Carry On Jack (1963) is missing so many of its usual regulars such as Sid James, Joan Sims and Hattie Jaques that it doesn't even neccecarily feel like a Carry On whilst Spying (1964) sees the much welcome addition of the bubbly Barbara Windsor. Their hilarious take on the epic disaster Cleopatra starring Elizabeth Taylor sees the series enter full swing and its best era, followed by the excellent CowBoy (1965) and the horror spoof Screaming (1966). These films all represent landmarks in British comedy so are therefore absolutley essential. Thats Carry On! (1977) fetures an affectionate look back at some of the best clips of the Carry on films through all eras that are linked by dialogue by Kenneth Williams and Barbara Windsor.Defintley recommended and is of fantastic value. 12 classic comic gems!",N/A

36277,"I don't care for anything John Carpenter has directed after 1982's ""The Thing"". However, I am a fan of H.P. Lovecraft's literature, and I do like Carpenter's earlier films, so when I was in the rental shop the other day I thought I'd give this film a viewing. I'm glad I did.""In The Mouth Of Madness"" is not an actual H.P. Lovecraft story; nor is it based on H.P. Lovecraft's work. It is, however, styled on and after H.P. Lovecraft's Cthulhu mythos and short stories. And the film, like a fungus, grows on you. Should you not be too impressed with it on the first viewing (as I was not), I recommend watching it again.The premise of ""In The Mouth Of Madness"" is about a fraud squad detective (Neill) hired by a publishing company to find the whereabouts of a mysterious best-selling horror novelist, as well as to look into the growing hysteria surrounding readers of his books.The performances are first rate, the story engaging and thrilling, the locations are colourful, and the cinematography, music, and special effects work very well in complementing the aforementioned. What's particularly interesting about this film is the style with which it opens: very Stanley Kubrick. And Carpenter certainly doesn't waste any time, either: there's never a dull moment in this film. And despite some big name seasoned actors in the cast, Sam Neill (who's become a big name himself) absolutely steals the show. ""In The Mouth Of Madness"" is an extremely well done, professional film with a fairly original story. And Lovecraft fans will definitely see familiar Lovecraft elements and creatures in this film, as well as get the disorienting feeling, albeit a shallow one, that Lovecraft implements in his stories about a particular narrator going mad, etc.But the film isn't without its share of downsides. For instance, I can't say that I really felt the credibility of the ""madness"", myself. It is because of the cerebral condition involved in madness, a condition that only a reader through his or her imagination can realistically conjure up and interpret, that I believe Lovecraft's work untranslatable to the big screen. In addition, I can't say I found anything in the film particularly scary, either. Eerie, perhaps - maybe even tense. But scary, no. With all the usual John Carpenter ""stingers"" and horrific creatures and sequences, I'm led to believe that this film was supposed to be scary. (I think, perhaps, I've just seen too many horror films that use the same old tricks, which this film is guilty of, to be scared by any of them anymore. Of course, should this film have come out in the early 1980s, I would've certainly been scared.) However, I did get confused, ""taken"", and muddled, as there are a good deal of twists in this film that are meant to disorient the viewer. In fact, there are so many twists that the viewer will come to expect them - which ultimately kills any kind of credibility of any particular scene henceforth. This is a problem. Another downside is the editing: certain shots should've been deleted from the film entirely to leave something to the imagination; other shots should've just merely been briefer to give more impact to the shot.However, despite the drawbacks I mentioned, which may not even be a factor for some viewers, ""In The Mouth Of Madness"" is the kind of Horror Thriller that will withstand the test of time and that one will be able to appreciate and enjoy in more than one viewing. Personally, I would've liked to have seen some deleted scenes interwoven in this film, myself, to have it fleshed out more.",N/A
676980,"I think the main strength of this movie is definitely its scenery and costumes.  Both were amazingly atmospheric and beautiful, and unashamedly echoed the emotions acted out around them.  Kidman and McGregor were both really good as the two leads - I found them believable and they created strong chemistry between them.  I also enjoyed the music although I wish 'Lady Marmalade' had been performed straight through, not just as backing for Zidler.  Some of the love songs don't seem amazing at first but they grow on you, and the Hindi Sad Diamonds play, El Tango de Roxanne, and The Show Must Go On were three songs that sent shivers down my spine - the camera angles were excellent (although I agree that sometimes it all gets a bit carried away and I would have appreciated a little less madness from the filming.)The weak point of the film is probably the characters, who are all pretty one-dimensional.  Normally this would constitute a major flaw, but in this I don't think it matters so much because what's important is the music and the atmosphere.  The actors are all doing their best with a rather weak script and that's good enough.I think this film would not be good if you were in a very cynical mood, if you hate musicals and/or high-camp glamour, or if you hate Nicole Kidman.  Otherwise, I strongly recommend it - even if you don't like it, it's different enough from most movies to make you think a little (even if it is only 'that's a perfect example of how not to make a movie'. ^_^) It's an original and exciting film and I don't regret seeing it for a moment!",N/A

104700,"Toward the end of Hammer Films' reign as THE horror movie studio, they decided to transport the Dracula character into the modern era. This was the first of two films where Dracula stalked the Swingin' Seventies.The best part of this film, sadly, is the dynamic opening sequence in which we bid farewell to the psuedo-Victorian age of the old Hammer Dracula--a battle between a Van Helsing and the Count on top of an out-of-control carriage. While there are occassional glimmers of similar excitement later in the film, this is as good as it gets. Dracula's death scene is also pretty nifty, even if he is (once again) dispatched almost as much by accident as by the actions of the hero.The biggest flaw are the thirty-year-olds that are cast as teenagers. Making matters worse, they aren't particularly good actors to begin with, so their lack of youth becomes even more distracting as the film unfolds.The only real bright spot in the flick is Peter Cushing who portrays a modern day decendent of his original Van Helsing character--sort of. There are some weird continuity issues that were probably invisible back when the film was released, but if one is anal (like me) and watches ""Horror of Dracula"" in close order to watching this one (like I did), the quirk screams out at you. Maybe there are really TWO Hammer Dracula storylines embodied in this series, rather like what happened with the Frankenstein one? (That could certainly explain the sadistic side that Dracula starting showing when Hammer Films entered the Seventies.)But, that's really a nitpick that has little impact on the overall film.It's a fact that Cushing delivers the only noteworthy performance here, with even the much-lauded Christopher Lee coming across as tired and slightly bored in the few scenes he appears in. The biggest strike against Cushing in this flick is a problem with the script; he is touted as a brilliant scholar and researcher, yet he has to work entirely too hard to figure out that the mysterious Johnny Alucard's last name is DRACULA spelled backwards! (Maybe itIt's an unfortunate fact that there are few truly chilling moments in this flick. The Satanic rite in the church where Dracula is returned to life isn't bad--although it would probably have been stronger if the actors involved had been better and had been a little closer in age to the teens they were portraying--and Van Helsing's confrontation with Johnny Alucard is also appropriately suspenseful, but that's about it. Even the final confrontation between Dracula and Van Helsing is rather ""eh.""This is the weakest entry in the Hammer Films Dracula series, with Peter Cushing earning it a full extra star all by himself.

188265,"This is not just another narcissistic music video catalogue but an attempt to capture creativity and it is done artfully revealing some of the inner churnings of a band that is semi-elusive compared to their popularity, Pearl Jam.What is surprising to me about ?Single Video Theory? is that it captures the ?everyday-ness? of the band members as they struggle and revel in the creation of their 5th studio album, ?Yield?  And in that everyday-ness we are surprised to find that they come off as everyday people, albeit immensely talented rage rockers at that, but we are brought into the ?ordinary? of an ?extraordinary? band.What's truly great in the interspersed nature of band interviews, improvs you don't hear on the record, versions of the songs in their early stages (also not on the record), and the pure love for music and creativity that comes across.  PJ's best drummer to date (and their has been a few) Jack Irons soaks his arm in a vat of ice as he recoups to once again spread rhythmic intricacies across the skins.

690585,"... 'Yes - Symphonic Live'. When I read this was a tour of YES and Orchestra I was pleased, especially seeing the track list. Close to the Edge, Gates of Delerium and Ritual are the long form tracks. All three sound outstanding with good orchestration arrangements. Of the three Close to the Edge impresses the most. Parts of Gates... just seem limp. Far from bad but at times uninspired in particular Steve Howe.I'm not sure what it is but he seems to have become fixated with clean guitar tones. The problem is some of his best and most fluid work are based on mildly to highly saturated distortion. Even his pedal steel has more grit than many of his other traditional guitar parts. Also, his stage presence while non-existant wasn't a problem, it just seemed like he was keeping an eye on everyone else. His solo pieces are pleasant although it seemed weird that all players other than the keyboardist get chances to be featured.Obviously he plays a diminished role between the orchestra and the main YESmen but at times you wish he was more involved. On Close to the Edge he aquits himself nicely, getting most of Wakeman's parts down, sometimes cleaner.In the 'wish this had been recorded' mode I could have done without another version of And You And I, Owner of a Lonely Heart and a few frequently recorded live tracks. On the other hand it is great fun to watch some of the orchestra dance around on Roundabout. There are muscular versions of Starship Trouper, Magnification and the long form songs.What is somewhat sad are the band's performances, in particular Steve Howe who has traded in the fire in his playing for precision. This is a shame as I love this guitarist's work. Also, Chris Squire is often so busy prancing around the stage that he doesn't pay attention to some less than spectacular lapses.The showmanship on this DVD comes from Alan White who seems to be the quarterback of the YES/Orchestra synergy. Jon Anderson seems to be having a great time and it radiates from the stage.The keyboard player is overdramatic, as if studying 70's prog rocker keyboardists and trying to emulate their theatrics. He doesn't have the look and seems too reserved for the faux high energy performance.Also, what was the director thinking with the cheesy special effects that crop up (thankfully) only a few times? But the icon for animations seems to show up no matter if you check the 'turn off icon' selection.Beyond this the picture is excellent with reasonable tight shots on soloists although there are still plenty of scenes of Jon Anderson playing gong while the rest of the band or orchestra go nuts. Still, the camera placements and editing are good and Dreamtime on disc 2 is revealing and worth watching.After viewing the documentary on the 2nd disc it is obvious that Howe is something of a control freak and does not play well with other guitarists, a shame as I like his playing and had hoped his personality would be as dynamic as his playing.For all the critical remarks I've made I can only dock Yes - Symphonic Live one star. The concert as a whole is very exciting and the playing is very good to exceptional.YES at it's worst is of better quality than most rock acts in existance. Watching them play is a great experience although the contrast of middle aged men rocking out with an orchestra of young, attractive people is a visually stark contrast.Even as a music DVD it's a great concert. The visuals are worthwhile and even the animations are pleasant although they can be turned off.Most importantly this DVD should appeal to old fans who will find a few newer tracks from the Magnification album which blend well with the classics.",N/A

Every outlet should apply the same standards to their work as did Criterion in this release.

It focuses more on the human side of the call to arms than any film I have ever viewed. Faced with the knowlege that Hitler was exterminating their fellow countrymen in order to provide ""living space"" for the future Reich, many millions of Russians answered the call to defend their existence. Many millions died before the war was over. Despite it's soviet origin, this film does a wonderful job of singling out just one individual, following his life through the ordeal of war, and giving us a glimpse of the true cost of the sacrifice made by the masses of young soldiers who have died defending their homelands around the globe.The dialog is outstanding.

It's a small moment, over in seconds; it doesn't even have anything to do with the lead players, except as an awful warning.  But is encapsulates what is so treasurable in Steven Soderbergh's cinema, and 'Eleven' in particular.  It inextricably links its characters' fate and struggle and endeavour to a precise place, the casinoscape of Las Vegas, a faceless monolith mocking all who presume to defeat it.  Soderbergh's vibrant, colourful, authentic filming of this milieu, with its vaults, corridors, secret passages, traps and panopticon transforms it from a gaudy joke, into a Beckett-like landscape of the soul (Las Vegas is, after all, surrounded by desert), where someone you can't see is always watching.Yes, in effect, 'Eleven' is updated John Huston.  But Huston went into his films already convinced of his philosophy - that human endeavour is doomed to failure - with an often deadening effect on his films.  Soderbergh is more open, more ambiguous, less convined of the rigidity of Fate.  He knows the dangers, but he knows the graces too.  He is more interested in certain characters than others - Clooney, Matt Damon and Carl Reiner especially - but all are ennobled by the job, by the communal bonhomie.For most of its running time, 'Eleven' just about misses out on classic status - the fleetfooted direction, giving every sequence a fresh tweak, novelty and resonance that keeps us expectant and fuelled; the engaging guy-play of the actors; the foot-flicking momentum of the jazzy soundtrack; can't quite hide the fact that the script is a bit flat, only funny because Clooney, Pitt, Gould and co. are great kidders, not because of its inherent qualities.  The Julia Roberts subplot seems initially like a bit of a sell-out that slows things down.  But, in the last 20 minutes - and I won't tell you how it happens, but you'll see what I mean - the pitch is raised, loose-ends don't so much come together as fruitfully coalesce; emotion seeps in with all the quiet, epiphanic rush of a Debussy moonlight.  The heist film escapes its mechanical grid and becomes something else, something provisional, doubtful, vulnerable, but quite beautiful - you realise that if you saw the film again, it would reveal so much more.",N/A

From the man that brought us Beavis and Butt-head, Mike Judge, who also makes an appearence in the film. If you have not seen this movie, or if you were like me, and thought it looked stupid, go rent it right now. Trust me, you won't regret it.",Office Space VHS
683801,"To say this film is good is an incredible understatement. What makes it so good is the jaw-dropping performances of its two Judys, Tammy Blanchard and Judy Davis. Ms. Blanchard plays Judy early in her life, up to Meet Me in St. Louis, and does one whale of a job. Her physical resemblance at times is eerie. Judy Davis portrays Judy from that film to the end, and HER resemblance is frightening! It's as if she 'channeled' the real Garland onto film. The concert performances were understandably lip-synced, but you feel as if you are watching actual concert footage. These two fine actresses each deserved and received emmies for their work, and the whole production should have received more. Knowing how Garland's life ended, I still broke down at the end, because it seemed like viewing history as it happened. This film is well-worth buying, and viewing over and over.",N/A

661495,"I had to get the first video of the wonderful manga series that I love! But I have to say, first off, I HATE AYA'S DUBBED VOICE! Because I am understanding about the lack of decent English seiyuus, I try to over look it, but I can't help wondering why they didn't release a subtitled version. Afterall, no one wants to miss out on Iwao Junko's beautiful voice playing Ceres. So, another thing that bugs me is that Aya's personality is very different in the anime than in the manga. In the anime she often comes out as a whiney girl. In the manga, she's more playful. Then there is the fact that they pronounce the name 'Ceres' as 'sAIR-iss'. Everyone know that the name for the Roman goddess of the harvest is pronounced 'seer-eez' sounding like the word 'series'. (Note: The name for the Roman goddess of the harvest and plants is the derivitive for the word 'cereal', you know, like those Cheerios you eat every morning. Think about that.) The last thing that bothers me about the anime is the way the main characters like Shuro and Kei have such a minor role. It's too bad, because Shuro is a really cool character. Other than that, the anime is funny, interesting and cool. It's more dramatic than the more light hearted Fushigi Yuugi, but the story is quite touching. I recommend it to fans of FY and otakus everywhere.",N/A
242652,"Very accurate telling of the Gospel according to Luke.  What concerns me about this movie is the portrayal of Jesus.  Like most movies of the life of Jesus, our Lord and Savior is portrayed in very somber terms, almost inhuman in a way.In real life, Jesus was one of us.  He was part man, part God.  Without sin, but fully enjoying of his time on this EarthBut the story line was execptionally accurate (unlike most tellings of the Gospel) and if you can deal with a Jesus character who seems removed from his surroundings, then this movie will be a great buy for you.",N/A
225250,"""The Omen"" is a supposedly scary film released in the late '70s which kicked off what was supposed to be a four-part franchise detailing the life of Damien, who we meet in this first movie.The movie's plot is rather lame: Gregory Peck, playing an ambassador, is convinced by a priest to switch his wife's stillborn (as far as he knows) baby with another baby, born June 6th at 6 a.m. Peck raises the baby as his own. Life goes on, but on Damien's 5th birthday, things occur that slowly convince Peck that his little devil actually is the Antichrist. The rest of the film details Peck's quest to learn more about Damien and questioning whether his precious little baby boy could actually be the spawn of Satan.If this sounds interesting, trust me it is not. It's all pieced together with choir music of the damned, as well as some hammy overacting, mostly from the maid and a Father who travels all the way from Italy to warn Peck of his son's quest. There's also some points about Peck's wife and her feelings toward the baby, but it's ignored later on. The film is about Peck and it belongs to him. I kind of feel sorry for this much-respected actor to appear in this film. Damien, on the other hand, is actually not really in the film that much, and if he is, it's just to stare at a dog or thrash about madly. The scenes of death and horror that occur are standard - there's the beheading, the flailing jump out a window, and such. And the whole plot seems tame compared to today. ""The Omen"" is no great scarefest.",The Omen VHS
529368,"We got to discussing favorite movies at work recently, and Vicki, one of the nurses I work with in the recovery room, said she'd seen Saving Grace and had really loved it.  She gave me a short recap of the film, and I decided it was worth a couple of hours of time and bought it. Normally I'm the type of movie goer who labors ad infinitum over the implications of each character's actions, and certainly the underlying drug theme might well have brought out that tendency with a vengeance, but in viewing Saving Grace, I was so beguiled by the charm of the village and it's delightful residents that I was able to suspend criticality and just enjoy my ""visit.""The venue of the story is a colorful coastal village in England.  Though a little bleak, the surrounding country side is open and green, with wonderful vistas of the sea, and the village is a cluster of quaint, old, stone buildings along narrow, little streets.  The title character, Grace, is the lady of the local manor and presides graciously over the social activities of her neighborhood.  Her home is a gorgeous vine covered house in the midst of well kept grounds, a home she loves and which she is unknowingly about to lose due to the capricious financial habits of her philandering and recently deceased spouse.  The story turns on Grace's outrageous plans to save her home and the naivety with which she pursues them, assisted or at least abetted by an assortment of delightful neighbors including her gardener, her doctor and even her husband's former mistress.Grace is played with great skill by Brenda Blethyn.  She's pretty and perky and just at ""that age"" where a women who had been financially independent for most of her life might find it difficult to start anew.  Even as she starts on her ""life of crime""-""I'm going to be a drugs dealer!""--one can't help but cheer her on for her audacity, just as most of her neighbors come to do.  Beset by collection notices with every post, the intrusion of an assessor who arrives as her door to evaluate her house for auction, and phone calls from a persistent London creditor, Grace takes the bull by the horns and bursts-or more properly blunders--onto the drug scene.  Craig Ferguson as her Scottish gardener Matthew, is the perfect instigator, naive enough himself to be funny but opportunist enough to see their approach to saving the manor as viable.Even though my husband and I are frequently at odds with respect to our film preferences, we both enjoyed this movie.  It was a thoroughly enjoyable and light hearted way to spend an evening.",Saving Grace
266913,"I think Bette Davis would appreciate my review title in the spirit in which it is offered.  After more that a dozen viewings of this movie I continue to pick up things that I had missed or, depending on my frame of mind at the time, overlooked.  There are so many layers to this film that it's like opening up a gift over and over.  Bravo!Favorite Lines:&quot;Why do they always look like nappy rabbits?&quot;&quot;It was a drizzly night.

284361,"Bette Davis stars as a nightclub &quot;hostess&quot; who gets mixed up with brutal crime boss Eduardo Ciannelli, an association that leads to tragedy for Davis.  She's one of five women who work at a clip joint, their jobs being to get as much money out of the male customers as possible.  Davis needs the money to help support her kid sister's education. However, when her sister Jane Bryan also gets mixed up with Ciannelli, Davis finds herself doing battle with the mob, both in court and out.  This is an unusually tough film and roll for Davis, and it's one of her more interesting ones.  She's very good, getting a number of scenes to cut loose.  Lola Lane and Isabel Jewell as two of her co-workers also give strong performances, as does Humphrey Bogart as the special prosecutor who fights for Davis.  It's unusual not to see Bogart as a heavy at this point in his career, and the change of pace displays his versatility.  Lloyd Bacon tightly directs the film, leaving little room for sentimentality.  The film has a hard edge that suits its theme very well.  It's well made and acted and fans of any of the stars will want to see it.",N/A
284873,"A number of Warner Brothers' top stars get a chance to do something different in this wartime musical.  Dennis Morgan, Joan Leslie, and Eddie Cantor star as ... performers trying to get into an all-star performance that will feature some of the top stars of the day.  This plot serves as a link to various numbers performed by actors not usually seen in musical rolls.  That's the fun of this film.  Errol Flynn's considerable charisma is on display in his bar room Cockney song which also demonstrates his physical agility.  Bette Davis puts in a game effort singing ""Their Either Too Young Or Too Old"", which also includes her being thrown about in a dance number.  Alexis Smith also gets tossed around, lifted, and twirled in another dance number.  Olivia de Havilland, George Tobias, and Ida Lupino are jitterbugging twits in a number that shows de Havilland's sense of humour and willingness to look silly.  Ann Sheridan sings to a group of girls about love, looking very beautiful as she does so.  Alan Hale and Jack Carson do a long duet, while a very awkward John Garfield sing-speaks ""Blues in the Night.""  Humphrey Bogart has an amusing bit where the always amusing S.Z. Sakall browbeats the tough guy.  Perhaps best of all is a rousing all-black number featuring Hattie McDaniel that is full of energy.  Thank Your Lucky Stars isn't a great musical jammed with memorable songs.  It's memorable because of the performances of its non-musical cast.  The connecting plot is passable and sometimes interferes with what the audience really wants to see, but not enough to be a liability.  Fans of film will want to see this one at least once.  It's one of a kind.",N/A

As he corrects certain things, he is able to move forward in the present.  The story of this episode has been seen before, but it is enjoyable all the same.The second episode here is ""Thank God It's Friday, Again"".  This episode takes place on a planet where every day is a work day, every night is a huge party with the promise that tomorrow is a rest day.  However, when tomorrow becomes today, the cycle is repeated.  The people are slaves to a plant which they cultivate.  The plant works like a narcotic on most of the people.  Some are able to resist and others with the help of a worm implanted in them can resist as well.  Crichton is given such a worm and soon learns the secret of the plant and this planet.  The plant is used by the Peacekeepers as it fuels their energy weapons and the planet is a giant storage facility for them.If you've never seen Farscape, this is a well-written show and worth watching.","Farscape Season 1, Vol. 1 - Premiere/I, E.T."

265556,"The DVD's attractive packaging and the chance to see this important film in widescreen don't quite overshadow the fact that some of the extras here are nothing special.  There are two documentaries on the background of the film and much of the information is interchangeable.  Director Altman's audio commentary is disappointing; he seems uninspired, self-congratulatory, and what he says often has little apparent connection to what's on the screen.  Nevertheless, I don't want to sell this DVD short, again because it gives viewers a chance to view the film in a format that is close to what its creators intended.  Having seen old TV versions of the movie, I felt like I was seeing it for the first time.  Like many counter-cultural classics of its time, MASH doesn't always hold up well.  It is a matter of ""you had to be there"": first, the cast and crew were obviously having a hell of a good time, playing to each other and Altman, not to the audience.  In the context of Vietnam and free love, seeing this must have been exhilarating.  Now, some of it seems mean-spirited and no more progressive than the values its makers were mocking.  But, in the context of the current ""war on terrorism,"" the film has considerable power: its message is that war is a bloody farce in which every chance to get drunk or laid must be taken.",M*A*S*H VHS
