The film has about as much continuous action as you could ask for in a war movie, and it's all well acted and produced.  It doesn't have the character development of the greatest war movies, but it is certainly more enjoyable than most!",N/A
943743,"Goodnight Mister Tom is a powerful adaptation of Michelle Magorian's award-winning novel of the same title, developed for Masterpiece Theatre and now available on DVD. Set during World War II, it tells the story of Tom Oakley, an old man curmudgeon who finds his life suddenly and drastically changed when a young boy is evacuated from London and sent to live with him. The boy is quiet, with a tragic past, yet the old man takes it upon himself to teach the boy improved reading and writing skills, and nurture his talent for drawing. A powerful bond develops between the pair; yet when the boy's mother summons him back to Blitz-torn London, Tom must act to save the child from a potential nightmare - and fight to keep him. A poignant and profoundly moving film about the pure essence of human relationships. Approx. 2 hours, color.",N/A
406156,"Cemetery Man stands apart from most other Italian horror films.  In fact, this one actually got good reviews from critics who normally slam the genre.  I remember it even having a very brief run at a theater in my hometown when it came out.  Michele Soavi needs no introduction to hardcore horror fans, and this film is definitely his baby.  Being Dario Argento's protege, Soavi's films have all had a bit of Argentoness to them.  For this film, it seems like the time Soavi spent with Terry Gilliam really rubbed off coz this film has a very Gilliamish feel to it.  I wonder if the grim reaper in this film is the same one used in Baron Munchausen!  The Gilliam touch and the fact that this movie's based on a comic would account for what people might feel are continuity errors, lapses in logic(not a new thing in Italian horror), a feeling of downright silliness and scenes that might seem just downright juvenile.  The film seems to exist in a kind of fantasy/fairytale type world, so it's easy for the viewer to accept the goofiness that sure as hell wouldn't be accepted in a straightforward horror film.  Needless to say, American audiences probably won't like it.  Rupert Everett is very impressive here.  No matter what film I see him in, in my mind his role of roles will always be Francesco Dellamorte.  Most of the roles he does anymore seem to exploit his homosexuality.  It's fine for awhile, but he seems to be typecast anymore.  Hell, in this film he plays a heterosexual man better than most heterosexual men probably could!  Then there's Anna Falchi who is simply the personification of sex on two legs.  She plays three roles, but they really aren't all that different from one another.  The dvd comes with a making of.. documentary that runs just shy of half an hour.  It's good and informative, but after waiting so long for this film to come out on dvd, the features are a bit of a letdown.  However, for better or worse, you can't deny that Cemetery Man is definitely a unique film.  It's difficult if not impossible to compare it to any one film.  Not many films accomplish being so morbid, zany and silly, yet can jerk you the other way and actually make you care about the characters in a dramatic sense.  Cemetery Man is a must see for Italian horror fans, or just horror fans in general.",Cemetery Man VHS

The second set are Spanish subtitles. The third set of subtitles are an English translation of the foreign dialog. These subtitles, however, do not appear where English dialog is spoken.BUY THIS!

633640,"I guess there are times you don't read the reviews in the paper, don't see any theatrical trailers, and don't hear ANYTHING.When this film showed up, it must have been one of those times.This is a great film, full of comedy and tragedy, great acting, unpredictable plot twists, sleezeballs, heroes, and more.  Joan Allen and Kevin Costner are great in this as a couple of drunken neighbors looking for comfort.  Director Mike Binder, who also plays the sleezeball, puts together a story of tremendous ""watchability.""  It's hypnotic... you can't keep yourself from wanting to know what happens next.

1053112,"There is a great scene in Pedro Almodovar's latest, ""Volver"" that encapsulates all that this wonderful, resonant movie is about: Raimunda (a sexy, earthy Penelope Cruz who has never been better on screen) sings a gypsy/flamenco style song, having not sang in public for many years but in possession of a gorgeous singing voice, while her mother Irene (the legendary Carmen Maura), thought to be dead , discretely listens from afar. Almodovar's camera cuts between mother and daughter, both totally committed emotionally to the scene, both recalling their former lives together, estranged for years but still possessing that particular brand of love that exists only between a Mother and her daughter, both longing for lives without trials and tribulations and fear, lives without problems, without cares. ""Volver"" (which means to return, to come back) is nothing if not about returning to the innocence of youth: to a time when Love abounded and came without a price and without consequences. But ""Volver"" is also about second chances, re-tooling you life albeit, Almodovar-style which always involves some manner of the strange, the violent sometimes and the weird. This line towards re-tooling/re-imagining your life is not a straight one by any means but a zigzagged one going from ""a"" to ""g"" more often than from ""a"" to ""b.""In ""Volver"" we have the extraordinary character of Raimunda played to the hilt by Penelope Cruz who has always been better in her native Spanish than she's ever been in her English films. Raimunda is strong, decisive, hard-working, married to a lout, a devoted mother and sister of Soledad (Lola Duenas) with whom she shares a strong bond now that their parents are dead.""Volver"" is a film almost totally without men except Paco, Raimunda's husband and Paula's (Raimunda's daughter)father who leaves the film early on and as such it reminds me of the Neo-Realist film classics of the  WW2 era, ""Open City"" and the Sophia Loren starring ""Two Women.""  But in this world without men that is ""Volver"" nothing seems amiss because the world that Almodovar has created is rich with well defined woman's roles: compassionately written and more importantly profoundly and deeply executed by the ensemble of actors that Almodovar has assembled: Cruz, Maura, Duenas and Blanca Portillo as Angelina.Once again with ""Volver,"" Almodovar has returned to the world of women alone and it is a film primarily about but definitely not only for women: their power over us, their weaknesses, their hopes, their desires. But ""Volver"" also shows us that mysterious inner core that all women possess which gives them an edge, a wisdom that men don't have. Call it maturity, call it a security, call it a special strength. You can even call it ""feminine intuition."" But, call it what you like, it's there, only women have it and lucky man, Pedro Almodovar is on a first name basis with it.",N/A

878814,"This movie was very wierd and different to me. What I was seeing was the mental breakdown of the husband who's wife was murdered. If you look at the movie in that aspect, it could be very interesting. Other than that, the movie didn't make much sense. The ending was an odd ending too.SPOILER ALERTThere wasn't any resolution to the ending. For me, it was just a cover-up of the police force that was getting rid of crooked cops and the wife was an ""innocent"" that was killed by accident. If you are into different and in an ""indifferent"" mood then this movie is for you. Otherwise, try another movie.",N/A
999686,"Although the film quality was not the greatest, it was viewable enough to see Danilova's artistry, as well as Massine's.  Films like this are important because they preserve dance for future generations and provide a meaningful link into the past.  There is much to emulate here and for those who have never seen the can-can danced, here it is in all its flashiness.  Shades of Toulous Lautrec -- this is indeed the real thing, costumes and all.  Suddenly the pictures have come to life and the dancing is perfect, even though the dancers dance with such spirit one would think they would get trampled.

942798,"Okay, so I want to say that if this movie hadn't been so hyped up I may have liked it more.  I thought it was decent for what it is, but oscar worthy it is not, all except a few supporting roles who seem to outshine the star whenever they're on screen.  Howard is an overrated entity, an actor with some star power that seems to be overhyped to the point that when you finally see him on screen your dissapointed because he just doesn't LIVE UP TO THE HYPE.  I hope he doesn't get the fifth slot at the oscars because his performance just isn't oscar material.  The movie as a whole carries a good value for us to see, that you don't have to stay where you are or feel that your place is confined to the life you live now...you can better yourself and you can rise above the prison you face.  DJay (Howard) is a pimp, hustler and drug dealer.  He has Nola (Manning in a great supporting role), his star ho and figuratize lil' sis and theres Shug (now here is the oscar worthy performance of the film...Taraji P. Henson shines here) pregnant and emotional and the light in DJays dark tunnel.  After meeting Key (Anderson), an old high school buddy he decides to try his hand at putting together a record.  With the help of Key and Shelby (DJ Quals who provides some laughs) he puts together a demo to show Skinny Black (Ludacris), the Memphis legend, once turning hits in his mothers laundry room and now rolling in the big leagues.  The film shows the fire in the eyes of those who want to be more than they are, and those that are wiling to fight to get where they need to be.  For a pimp who's shot down almost every step of the way DJay shows he has the fight to make it, but will he?  The film is decent, a good film that shows who you can be if you work hard at it...with some impressive suppoting roles and an impressive script.  My only complaint is all the hype...I sat down expecting an oscar winner and I got a popcorn muncher...Maybe it'll fair well at the MTV movie awards...It belongs there.  3 1/2 stars for me.",Hustle & Flow

915942,"Realtive to other somewhat classic British crime movies, ala Mona Lisa, The Long Good Friday, Lock Stock and Two Smoking Barrels, Snatch, etc., Layer nuzzles in comfortably, taking a place at the table. It is a genre that is consistently watchable, as the mixture of articulate English-ness meets the blunt realities of crime and criminals. While Lock Stock is probably most famous, it is more of a comedy-a smart funny crime comedy, and Layer Cake more edgy and brutal.Ultimately it becomes about XXXX's inadvertent road to freedom, a twisty road at that, and like the metaphor of the cake it is named after, isn't too substantial, though tastes and looks good.Daniel Craig is clearly going to be around, as he has built on the work he did in Road to Perdition, Munich and probably his upcoming Bond-ness. Here he is terrific, being stoic and strong, and expressive in his jockeying for position in the ever twisted plot. The acting and writing are cool and clipped, active and clever. The music too is catchy, the style, quite apparent.I'd say, rent, or catch on demand, etc.....",Layer Cake

123350,"The star power is tremendous in this movie, but what really makes this movie standout from other westerns is what ISN'T in the movie.  No great horse chase sceens, most all the action is set in a small town.  Likewise, no striking vistas, just your run of the mill town.  You have a cattleman/farmer battle, but seen neither cattle or a homestead shot to heck.  And there's very little gunplay.What makes this movie great is EVERYTHING, which means most of the credit probably goes to producer/director John Ford.  James Stewart has the bulk of the screentime, and his character's determination to do the right thing without violence is in good contrast with Wayne's character, who believes that justice with the gun is the only reasonable course in the west.Lee Marvin's portrayal of Liberty Valance is evil, plain and simple.  He does what he wants, and gets away with it because no one every quite has the evidence to hang him, and everyone (other than Wayne, Stewart and the town drunk/newspaper editor) are afraid to oppose him.A key to its greatness is the interaction of the characters.  Wayne's character is cut from ruff timber, but he's likable, and care's about doing the right thing.  It contrast nice with Stewart's softer upbringing.  But they'd be great friends if it wasn't for a certain woman.  The sheriff's a coward, and the editor is a drunk, but he'll print what has to be said.There is great humor, but the everyday type you might really see between people.  The dialog is great, with hardly a word waisted.  The only slight criticism I might have is that Stewart is probably a few years older than the script intended (after all, he just got out of law school, but looks 50).  Wayne's age doesn't play as badly, and could be a reason he would be so accepting of the way things turned out.The quality of the DVD is good, but it could have been a little less contrasty.  There are very little extras included.Imagine a movie that possibly is the best character James Stewart portrays in any movie.  Imagine a movie that possibly has the best character John Wayne portrays.  And imagine this being the same movie!",N/A

958933,"The House on Telegraph Hill may not be an A thriller, but it's a B-plus thriller trying hard. It has an intriguing premise, characters who may not be who they seem, a great locale in San Francisco and a big, gloomy mansion.Victoria Kowelska (Valentina Cortese; spelled Cortesa in the credits) is a Polish survivor of the Belsen concentration camp. Her husband was killed by the Germans and her home in Poland has been destroyed. Just before the camp is liberated her closest friend dies. This was a woman who had a wealthy aunt in America. Victoria's friend managed to smuggled her baby boy out of Poland and to the aunt just as the Germans invaded. Given a chance at a new life in America, Victoria grabs for it. She uses her friend's papers to assume her friend's identity. After spending time in a relocation camp, she learns the aunt has died. She makes her way to America and in New York meets the boy's guardian, Alan Spender (Richard Basehart). The boy will inherit the aunt's riches when he comes of age. Spender, who has adopted the boy, is initially suspicious of Victoria, but then he seems captivated by her. Victoria believes that she can love the boy as her own and find security with Spender. In a whirlwind decision they marry, return to San Francisco...and then suspicious things begin to happen.If Victoria is not who she pretends to be, it may be than Alan Spender isn't either. Hovering in the background and living in the mansion on Telegraph Hill with them is Margaret (Fay Baker), the boy's nanny. Margaret is a tightly wound woman, controlling, and is not pleased with the marriage. Into this mix drifts Marc Bennett (William Lundigan). Before long, he and Victoria begin finding their way toward a relationship of their own.The movie has several things going for it. Robert Wise, the director, takes his time setting the scene with Victoria, letting us know how her feelings for security were formed at Belsen. The action moves step by step, slowly and steadily building up our suspicions about Spender, leading us on to dislike Margaret and making everyday actions like driving a car or drinking orange juice something to be wary of. The film is carefully photographed to create mood. The bright San Francisco days and the busy streets of the city contrast nicely with the gloominess and tension in the old mansion.What keeps this out of the A list is, I think, the actors. They all do fine jobs but there just isn't the camera-catching interest that many first-rank star actors can bring to a role. Cortese is effective and sympathetic. Basehart does a skilled job of slowly letting us see little, disquieting emotions. He was a skilled actor but somehow seemed to lack the charisma that makes evil or derangement fascinating. Lundigan was a big, handsome guy but who always seemed like the extra man invited to fill out a dinner party, attractive but not much there. Fay Baker, however, nearly manages to steal the movie. Her role is more complex than we're led to believe, and she pulls it off with skill.I've always admired Richard Basehart even if I seldom found any individual role he played, especially later on in his career, very interesting. He always turned in a solid performance and he was versatile. When he started out in movies he managed to land several roles in interesting movies that helped establish his career. On DVD check him out in He Walked by Night (1948) as a very cool criminal or in Reign of Terror (1949) as a paranoid Robespierre. He steals every scene he shares with the movie's hero, Robert Cummings. On late night cable you might get a chance to see him in Decision Before Dawn (1951) as a sympathetic army officer dealing with a German POW, Oskar Werner, or in Fourteen Hours (1951), a flawed film with some excellent performances, or in a supporting role in Repeat Performance (1947), his first movie. Repeat Performance is a gem; a woman kills a man, runs to a friend for help, and when she arrives realizes that time has moved back a year. She has a second chance, but will anything she do make a difference?Some call The House on Telegraph Hill a noir. It isn't, in my view, especially with the term ""noir"" now seen as a great marketing device to sell old movies. It's a skillfully put together psychological thriller with a great premise. The DVD picture looks good and there is a commentary track, which I didn't listen to, by Eddie Muller. He's listed as being a noted film historian.",House on Telegraph Hill

One of the more chilling effects in the picture occurs when the head of the family of vampires walks through a forest in the daytime, blooming flowers instantly die as she passes.The film has a very good musical score, beautifully done sets and good cinematography (As do most of the Hammer Films).  The cast is perfect, and includes the stunningly beautiful Caroline Munro.

The story of an architect (Michael Sheen) who loses his wife and job due to the severity of his conditions, the film nimbly balances semi-tragic character study, humor, and love story. Yes, you're likely to find yourself laughing, which is fine; it is a comedy, to some extent. However, the film-and thus the viewer-never loses sight of the human beings behind what's happening. It's a credit to everyone involved-especially Sheen and Shirley Henderson, a fellow OCD sufferer who helps him try to right the ship when he hits bottom-that we giggle a lot less than we feel touched by these characters.",Dirty Filthy Love
52776,"This film is only ""minor"" if you discard the Western as a medium. A huge amount of critical ink has nevertheless been expended on it. One obvious error: the ""gunslinger"" is not a reincarnation of the honest Jim Duncan.He is the nemesis of the townsfolk and in that role profoundly morally ambiguous.Some of the townsfolk even think he is the Devil !! Like all great Westerns its theme is basically extremely simple: no good will come of evil. The townsfolk make a terrible error in allowing their Sheriff to be murdered - after all he was only trying to expose wrongdoing ( the building of the mine on Govt land). HOW the gunslinger exposes their moral cowardice and hypocrisy IS the film. Not a minor but a major classic, including some fine cinematic moments ( the transformation of the town into the red-painted ""hell"" for example).Forget ""Citizen Kane"", this is probably the best-ever film by a director/lead actor,(Eastwood of course). Its moral impact is certainly far clearer if fairly right of center - well it IS a western !.",N/A

He delivers the goods in a recreation of the Depression Era, and a deeper examination of the popular love of crime and criminals vs the system and the fat cats. The action is graphic and sometimes hard to watch, a la Bonnie and Clyde. Ben Johnson's Melvin Purvis is a great foil for Oates' and smaller parts go to actors of the stature of Harry Dean Stanton and Richard Dreyfuss at early moments in their careers.

917011,"This must be the first erotic film I've seen that isn't pornography, and because it shows real sex in explicit detail it has enormous potential for degenerating into porn.  Two young people explore each other in and out of bed, while there are snippets of second-string pop groups in concert between the bouts of sex - not sure why, unless it is to legitimise the movie to allow it to be shown on public screens.  What makes this film different is that the sexual desire is palpable.  It must also be the first time that ejaculation has been allowed to be shown in the non-porn movie industry.

205537,"Bend of the River is in many ways Anthony Mann's `nicest' Western, but underneath the gorgeous Technicolor location work there's a darker side to Stewart's border raider desperate to reform and his relationship with friendly enemy Arthur Kennedy that threatens fireworks to come - and when they do, in the last 20 minutes, there's no problem in believing the depth of Stewart's rage or the relentlessness of his pursuit. Shot on many of the same locations as the even darker The Far Country, it's still terrific entertainment. Stepinfetchit's role is a little uncomfortable, but compared to the humiliation inflicted upon him in other pictures he's allowed a bit more dignity here than usual, closer to Hank Worden's Old Mose Harper in The Searchers than the racial stereotypes other directors expected.As with Universal's DVD of Winchester '73, the print quality isn't always quite as good as it could be, but it's mostly an acceptable transfer.",N/A

227135,"Out of all of the movies in the 1980s that were influenced by Raiders of the Lost Ark, Romancing the Stone was arguably the best of the bunch (even if it was written before Raiders) because it managed to successfully blend action and adventure with a good dose of humour that resulted in a thoroughly enjoyable and entertaining experience. It also helped Michael Douglas make the jump from television to A-list movie star and shot Kathleen Turner's career into the mainstream.Douglas' character has the same kind of roguish charm as Indiana Jones albeit with a bit more of an emphasis on the comedy. And like Han Solo, he's a little full of himself and the humour in the film comes when he's knocked off his smug high horse. Turner is an excellent foil to Douglas and Joan makes a credible transformation from meek wallflower to a much more confident and assertive individual - closer to the heroines in her novels. In addition to being quite funny, Turner is also beautiful and smart. The `80s were good to her with a string of hits that included Body Heat and Prizzi's Honor but it was this film that really established her as a movie star.Romancing the Stone also helped launch director Robert Zemeckis' career who would go on to direct an even larger hit with Back to the Future. He wisely doesn't try to ape Raiders' retro pulp serial approach, instead going for a more contemporary look while capturing that film's more overt comedic moments with broad slapstick that is a little too silly at times but fortunately Zemeckis keeps them to a minimum. The commercial success of Romancing the Stone spawned an inferior sequel, The Jewel of the Nile but the chemistry between the two leads (and DeVito) was used effectively again in The War of the Roses.There are eight deleted scenes with more footage of Jack and Joan bonding in the jungle, including a bit with her bathing and them falling asleep together in the crashed plane that they wait out the rain in. We also see Joan back in New York telling her editor to publish her new novel based on her adventures in Colombia.""Rekindling the Romance: A Look Back"" features Douglas, DeVito and Turner returning for new interviews recounting, with fondness, their experiences making the movie. By everyone's account, it was a tough shoot with extreme weather and an unforgiving environment with Turner recalling the numerous injuries she endured. This is a nice look back at the movie.""A Hidden Treasure: The Screenwriter"" profiles the movie's screenwriter, Diane Thomas. Douglas was taken with the blend of action, comedy and romance. Thomas tragically died in a car accident. This extra is a nice, little tribute to her.""Douglas, Turner and DeVito: Favorite Scenes."" The three leads pick the scenes that they like the most and they aren't necessarily the ones you'd think (no, not the famous mudslide scene - thankfully).""Michael Douglas Remembers.""

And this season, in the opinion of some, was supposedly the beginning of a decline in the writing quality until the resurgence in full force of the last season.Personally, I never felt any degradation of the amazing writing and acting this show always displays.  This really is one of the very best sitcoms ever produced, no doubt about it.  Some feel like the fact that this is the season where Daphne and Niles become a couple made everything less funny somehow but to me, this new twist in their relationship was very satisfying to watch and still works very well.This season is very strong and even contains 3 of my favorite episodes ever, namely ""Frasier's Edge"", a moving episode where Frasier does some serious soul-searching about his life, ""Hungry Hearts"" where Jane Leeves's real life pregnancy was cleverly handled and Daphne comes to terms with her weight gain and last but not least ""Forgotten But Not Gone"", a hilarious episode where Frasier leaves the wine club to start a segment about wine on radio.Those 3 episodes are to me among the very best of the whole Frasier saga and I found every episode very enjoyable, never feeling this lapse in quality certain people experienced.  Which goes to show that it's always a matter of opinion but don't hesitate to buy this one if you loved the other seasons. If you're anything like me, you won't be disappointed at all.The only thing I feel is lacking in most DVD sets of Frasier is the fact that we never get any extras, although I felt like the package still deserves 5 stars.  Only a few earlier seasons had some bonus material but still, we never got any bloopers which is something I really yearn for.  I am sure it would be hilarious to see the actors break out of their characters I have grown to love so much.  It's a minor flaw because every episode here more than compensates for this but it would be nice to get some bonus with the coming seasons.I still watch every season of Frasier very often and along with ""Friends"", this is my favorite sitcom ever.  Just for the acting alone, a very strong aspect of the show which goes hand in hand with the brilliant writing, this is worth watching over and over again. So if you liked Frasier so far, I don't see any reason why you won't continue to do so because this season is every bit as good as all the previous ones.",FRASIER: COMPLETE EIGHTH SEASON

946444,I had heard that this movie didn't do all that well at first at the box office. I had really low expectations. After watching it I must say that I thought it was pretty good and had some really entertaining action sequences. It kind of reminded me of a Bruckhiemeer version of THX 1183. Scarlett Johansen and Ewan McGregor were both excellent in their roles. It had all the twists and turns that any movie involving the complexities and moral questions of cloning should have.I liked it. Check it out.,N/A

285362,"I was watching this movie last night primarily because I like Gable as an actor.  The movie started out in much the same way most movies did back then; setting the stage for the eventual mild action and not-so-mild romance.  I was watching but doing other things at the same time until I realized that the dialogue was gradually elevating itself to a level well above ""just another Clark Gable movie"".  I found myself focussing on the interaction between the characters; reluctant comrade prisoners escaping from Devil's Island.  The characters were diverse with little focus on their criminal background (except for Paul Lukas's Bluebeard-like past).  Some had strong allegiances with others while others were just in it for themselves.  The discussions that they had were as though written by one of the better playwrights of that era although I had never heard of the writer, Richard Sale, before.  There were moral issues and material issues discussed and there were some noble sacrifices involved.  Eventually, the escapees returned from their own little world to the ""real"" world and, not coincidently, the dialogue returned from the exceptional to the banal.  The ending was standard Hollywood fare.  However, I will gladly see this movie again for the bulk of the movie between opening and closing that puts ""Strange Cargo"" in a higher class of film.The acting was very good with top honors going to Gable, Joan Crawford and especially Ian Hunter whose role was the one that grabbed my attention the most.  Oddly, one of my favorite character actors, Peter Lorre, was generally unimpressive in his role.  Gable's role called for his character to be shrewd, sinister, and selfish.  He comes across very well although, being Gable after all, he succumbs to the allure of Joan Crawford in the romantic ending.  I'm sure that ample credit for this movie's success lies with Frank Borzage.  The film had the look of a perfectionist who made sure that the lines were delivered with meaning and character rather than just good enough to get by with.  This is definitely one of Gable's top ten films; maybe even the top five.",Strange Cargo VHS
915387,"Several months after the horrifying events of the original film, Rachel Keller (Naomi Watts) takes her creepy son, Aidan (the still charmless David Dorfman) and relocates to a small town far from the city. Soon after her arrival, a teen is found murdered so Rachel decides to do some investigating. She discovers that Samara is alive and well (no pun intended) and up to her old tricks. Unable to escape her evil influence, Rachel must do some more detective work or else her son, who begins to show signs of possession may pay the ultimate price.Inferior sequel to the original horror hit is still an enjoyable watch. Thanks largely to the creative visual effects. This installment relies less on suspense and more on cheap thrills but if you let yourself get taken in by the awesome images on display, you may easily forget that the story doesn't make a whole lot of sense. The film's possession theme is an interesting one but it's very sloppily done. The director took a great idea and did absolutely nothing with it. Which is a shame because there are layers to this story that could have been expanded on or executed better. It appears the director was too busy trying to make this picture look good therefore neglecting the plot. But as I mentioned previously, if this film works, it's because it's visually spellbinding. In one incident, during Aidan's bath, we see water pour upwards out of the bathtub and drip from the bathroom ceiling. In another creepy scene, we see the murderous Samara scratch Aidan's bedroom wall which then grows into an over-sized, fiery stain. In another, we witness Samara, almost spider-like, climb and claw her way out of the well in pursuit of a frightened Rachel. Episodes such as these are reason enough to recommend this picture. Another good reason is the great cast. Naomi Watts is great as the distraught Rachel Keller, a mother who desperately tries to save her only child's soul. Other's in the cast include Elizabeth Perkins and an almost unrecognizable Sissy Spacek who is especially creepy as Samara's birth mother. With her messed up hair and sad, weathered face, Spacek delivers the most chilling line in the film ""You let the dead get in.""We can all agree that ""The Ring Two"" is inferior in almost every way to the original. However, the great cast, good performances and spine-chilling imagery should please many horror film fans. They should definitely give this film a try.Recommended.",N/A

784258,"Another perfect film is now readily available on DVD.  This film is widely recognised as one of the best musicals ever.  It combines a superb Rodgers and Hart score with the subtle sexy humour of Ernst Lubitsch and the visual flair which Rouben Mamoulian, the director, brought to so many of his films.Maurice Chevalier plays a tailor who meets princess Jeanette MacDonald when he visits her castle to collect outstanding debts from Charlie Ruggles. Macdonald is a widow who keeps fainting not from ""wasting away"" as the doctor diagnoses, but ""being wasted"".  Macdonald falls for Chevalier and after a few plot devices which will keep them apart because he is a commoner, they reunite to live happily ever after. If the story sounds like a fairy tale, it is but that does not detract from the enchantment of the piece.Chevalier plays his usual charming self and Macdonald is sexy and funny in a way she rarely showed with Nelson Eddy.  Myrna Loy is ravishing as her nymphomaniac cousin and this comes as a surprise to those who know her as the perfect wife.  All of the supporting cast are memorable though Charlie Ruggles steals every scene in which he appears.The score includes the incomparable ""Mimi"", ""Lover"" and ""Isn't it Romantic"". The commentary by Miles Kreuger is outstanding, avoiding mere biographical details and really giving us insight into the relevance of this film in 1932 and why it still stands up today.  There is a lot of information about what was cut from the film when it was reissued, cuts which have been lost for ever at this date.

Yes, stage plays are quite dfferent from movies and often have to be rethought for the screen,  but I don't think that's an excuse for throwing out a very large percentage of the play to make time for dull silent wandering around and a few intellectual sight gags.

956503,"This is one heck of a great collection for people like me who don't want to get all the episodes from all the series.  As I really like the Borg episodes and I already have the complete TOS and DS9 collections, this is excellent as no TOS episodes(obviously) and no DS9 episodes are on this which means I get to avoid any overlaps!This collection starts with one of the few good Enterprise episodes, ""Regeneration"" where Borg are discovered on the North Pole, remnants from the encounter with Cochrane and the time-travelling TNG crew as detailed in the Borg movie, are inadvisedly revived by clueless scientists and it's up to Archer's gang to clean up the inevitable mess that's caused.We next get the introduction of the Borg as Q decides to teach Picard a lesson in humility by sending the Enterprise into the Delta quadrant to face the Borg.  Once this Pandora's box is opened, the episode ends with the foreboding feeling that this would not be the last time that the Federation would have to face the Borg.We then get the 2 episodes of ""The Best of Both Worlds"" which end disc 1 where Picard becomes assimilated!  Disc 2 begins with ""I, Borg"" where Picard faces the ethical dilemma of using an ""innocent"" disconnected member of the collective as a vehicle to infect the Borg with a killer virus or to send ""Hugh"" back unharmed?  The next 2 episodes, ""Descent, I & II"" are probably the weakest ones on this whole collection as we get to see Hugh again but with Data getting his loyalties confused due in no small part to the designs of his evil brother.  The plot is weak and the episodes very weak overall but fear not as the other episodes more than make up for this.We now get Voyager episodes that are among the best ever of the series in ""Scorpion I & II"" which introduces us to Seven of Nine and a species that is actually stronger than the Borg!  Next we get an episode that is very similar to ""I, Borg"" except that ""One"" instead of ""Hugh"" gets to be the star for an episode.  Disc 3 ends with ""Dark Frontier"", where we get to see the Drone Queen in all her dark majesty.Disc 4 contains both episodes of ""Unimatrix Zero"" where we see Janeway and her crew manage to plant the seeds of dissent and individuality into the collective mind and finally with my favourite Voyager episode, we get ""Endgame"" where Janeway defies Starfleet and goes back into time to secure a better, alternative future for her crew.All the episodes here are ordered so well and all tell of a very unique element of the Borg while introducing key characters in doing so.  As I'm not a fan of Q and I had to tolerate his appearance on thankfully just the one episode on these discs and as I already have the best time travel and Klingon episodes both here and on TOS and DS9, until they release other themes of Fan Collectives, this Borg Collective is all I need for now.Very highly recommended!",Star Trek Fan Collective - Borg
904464,"I'll tell you ""Cursed"" doesn't take itself very seriously as a horror film, or as a comedy. It seems to be trying to decide which it wanted to be, and hadn't made up its mind in time for the closing credits. There are a few genuine laughs to be found throughout, and some nifty references to the bygone days of Universal Creature Features, but for the most part this is a silly, airbrushed effort, filled with Beautiful People acting stupidly.I should have considered myself warned when I saw Scott Baio's name in the opening credits. The werewolf itself has a few good scenes, but I was kind of disappointed to see the legendary Rick Baker's name in the credits, and then find myself face to face with a CGI beast later on. And what was Christina Ricci doing in this? Did she lose a bet with Wes Craven or something?This film might have fared better in the 80s, but it seems somewhat lifeless and unimaginative these days.

198308,"OK, Audie Murphy fans, don't bash this review.  Audie Murphy was a great man, and a true American hero.  However, this much has to be said, all of the five star reviews of this movie here reflect a continuing admiration for the man, and not for the movie itself.As a child, I had often heard about Audie Murphy, about his status as ""the most decorated soldier in America"", and his later career as a B-movie star in Hollywood westerns.  Whenever Audie Murphy was mentioned, ""To Hell and Back"", both the book and the movie, were usually also mentioned.And so for all these years, I knew that this movie existed, but had never seen it.  One day, I finally read the book, and then checked out the movie at the local library.  And then I read some of Audie Murphy's biographies.What to say about this movie except that it was almost certainly the high point in the life of Audie Murphy.  Murphy was the sixth of twelve children of desperately poor Texas sharecroppers.  The father would abandon the family and the mother would die when Audie was sixteen.  World War II intervened, and Murphy's natural wholesomeness and survivalist skills as a hunter-warrior would provide him a route to become a national hero and a life as a movie star.""To Hell and Back"" was Murphy's most successful movie.  It was made in 1955, at a time when Americans wanted only to forget the dreadfully inconclusive Korean War, preferring to relive the simpler glories of WWII.  As a war movie, it has all the typical characteristics of that era - an unquestioning respect for the military (and all authority in general), and an unspoken acceptance of the concept (totally foreign to us today) that soldiers' lives are by nature expendable in a war.  Like other war movies of the 1950's, we never see any blood, nor are there guts spraying everywhere, and definitely no mortally wounded soldiers screaming in fear and agony.  Enemy soldiers who are killed fall quickly, silently and bloodlessly to the ground, like dummies.  American soldiers who are killed also fall silently and bloodlessly to the ground, but get more screen time - we get to see their faces contort in agony as they die from their phantom wounds.  Realism having long ago been lost, the heavy equipment of war - the tanks and other weapons - are also not quite right.  The burning M10 tank destroyer that Audie Murphy jumped on becomes a more readily procurable Sherman tank.  German tanks are substituted by the then prevalent M41 Walker Bulldogs.No, this is not ""Saving Private Ryan"".  Nor ""Platoon"".  Nor ""Apocalypse Now"".  This is not even ""The Longest Day"".  War movies are never meant to be documentaries, and thus are always limited in their depiction of real war by the social constraints of the times, and the Hollywood need to put a spin on a story that will bring in the customers.What I find most sad about ""To Hell and Back"", having read Audie Murphy's biographies now, is that his real story was much better:  Murphy's bravery, fighting skills, and exploits were even more astounding than what was depicted in this most sanitized and unrealistic of war movies.  Achieving all of that in the context of the poverty that he grew up in was even more amazing.  Much of this was because the ever modest Audie Murphy refused to allow his life and his exploits to be glamorized.Yes, Audie Murphy's story needs to be remade.  But such a story would find no currency in today's Hollywood - imagine that, a movie about a young white man, pulling himself out of poverty by becoming a soldier for his country, fighting for over two years continuously, and excelling at the art of war.  And then returning home as a hero, and finding even more success in life as a movie star, thanks to the help of many fellow Americans (James Cagney among them).  ""To Hell and Back"" was indeed the product of a different time.",N/A
499961,"OZ - THE COMPLETE SECOND SEASON is every bit as good, if not better than the first season. It begins with the staff and prisoners of Oz trying to get back as close to normal as possible after the riot, the cliff-hanger that ended Season 1. Several prisoners and guards died in the riot, a good way to get rid of characters who are going on to other things, a standard device of soaps.The drugs, rapes, murders, and unrest continue; but new characters are introduced, and many of those returning grow and change. McManus becomes more cynical; and both O'Rielly and Schillinger show glimpses of humanity although I won't rest until someone snuffs out that Aryan Nazi. Said becomes an even more sympathetic individual this season (he figures prominently in the season finale); Beecher stands up to Schillinger, a priest child molester enters Oz as well as a woman who drove her car into a lake drowning her child, reminiscent of the murder in South Carolina a few years ago.This season is more bloody and violent than the first season if that's possible and definitely not for the faint of heart.",N/A
392109,"The Innocents (Jack Clayton, 1961)Jack Clayton didn't direct many films over the course of his life, but it seems as if every one of them has developed at least a cult following over the years. The Innocents is one that continues to keep its director's name alive. Based on Henry James' ""The Turn of the Screw,"" The Innocents is the story of Miss Giddens (the mighty Deborah Kerr), who takes a position as a governess to Miles (Village of the Damned's Martin Stephens) and Flora (Pamela Franklin, who went on to be a familiar TV actress, guest starring in a number of shows) after the death of their previous governess. The childrens' behavior gets somewhat odd, and Miss Giddens, with the help of her only real friend, Mrs. Grose (Oliver!'s Megs Jenkins), must determine whether the children are simply being malicious, or whether supernatural elements are afoot.This is good stuff, a mystery/horror film that relies mostly on atmosphere to get its point across. There are some times when it crosses the line into cheesiness-- the ""eerie"" reflection of a ghost's face in the window, for example-- but there's been far, far worse in the ensuing forty-five years. Clayton did this one up right, and it deserves to be seen. *** ",The Innocents VHS

It's got the discipline of the Zhang Yimou movies and the dopiness of the 90s HK movies. Watching this movie, I felt like the director shot the screenplay as is without rewrites and managed to use a lot of the better sets with production values.What I didn't get was an ounce of passion. The reasons why the girl is in love with the slave (whom she thinks is the general in one of those Cyrano de Bergerac twists) are stupid. The curse/promise is obviously made to be broken and the villain is the only thing this movie has going for him (feather boas rule!)Beyond that it's a mishmosh of martial arts sequences filmed many times over and storylines cribbed from The Young & the Restless. I find myself amazed that cheesier/clumsier/cheaper movies like Green Snake and Bride with White Hair surpass this movie.

635847,"Films based on comic books are a bit of a mixed bag.  While never my favorite genre, the stakes have been raised in recent years.  With sophisticated outings such as ""Batman Begins"", ""X-Men 2"", and ""Spiderman 2"" and ""Superman Returns"", it seems that we've ushered in an age of comic book adaptations as art.  These films surprised me and entertained me (as any movie should), but also utilized real drama, intelligence and adult sensibilities--often with great performances and smart, logical scripts.  Even graphic novels have become a popular source for serious minded films.So ""The Fantastic Four"" is a throwback.  Far from sophisticated, it plays as a live action cartoon.  That might be OK, but the more pressing problem is that it's not particularly fun either.  I know a lot of people feel that ""The Incredibles"" borrowed heavily from ""The Fantastic Four"" concept, and maybe so.  But at least on film ""The Incredibles"" was rousing entertainment.  Maybe the film ""Fantastic Four"" should have taken that cue.I won't blame the actors.  I actually like many of them (in other roles).  It's a lackluster, sloppy script.  The filmmakers never really cared about this subject and it shows.  First and foremost, they wanted a commercial film to play to a mass audience--kiddies included.  And I can imagine small children getting a few chuckles from The Human Torch and The Thing.  Their interactions, after all, are the equivalent of junior high taunting.  But it's just not funny enough, the effects aren't original enough, and it sure lacks a brain.

961951,"""Dallas"" was the grandest, ""Dynasty"" the campiest, ""Falcon Crest"" the most cartoonish but ""Knots Landing"" was the warmest and most humane.The long-awaited first season on DVD is a great beginning to a great series.  What fun to revisit late 70s suburbia and see how Val, Gary, Karen, Laura and the rest all met and grew to know one another.  While future scene stealers like Abby and Greg haven't yet arrived, this first season of ""Knots Landing"" is wonderful.The writers do a great job of developing each family on the cul-de-sac; in fact, they do such good work that no matter how outrageous some of the storyline twists and turns would be in the ensuing years (and this being ""Knots"", even their wildest stories were never on the scale of Moldavian massacres and season-long dreams), the characters stayed grounded and true to themselves and made everything more palatable.This season also has the first appearance of Julie Harris as Lilimae, the ONLY appearance by Charlene Tilton as Gary and Val's daughter Lucy and Gary's first onscreen battle with the bottle in a gritty two-part season finale.Make sure you listen to the hilariously self-deprecating commentaries with Ted Shackelford and Joan Van Ark, and watch their reunion footage.  The chemistry between them is as strong as ever, and it's moving to see them together again.Let's all hope for a timely release of Season Two as Abby moves onto Seaview Circle and shakes everything up for good.",N/A
172452,"I found BROKEBACK MOUNTAIN a painfully sad experience--wonderfully filmed, as Ang Lee's movies usually are, and well acted, but deeply depressing. It was comparable to watching a slow-motion train wreck on an ironically beautiful, bright sunny day--or reading one of Thomas Hardy's later novels.Neither Ennis Del Mar nor Jack Twist (played by Heath Ledger and Jake Gyllenhaal) was a character that most of us would admire or respect: both were like good-looking Lost Boys who never became responsible adults with the passage of time. Despite their differences in temperaments and experiences, they were like a pair of perpetual Peter Pans, poorly educated, pitifully below average intelligence, and morally irresponsible.Most would agree that our DNA and the vissitudes of life largely determine what handicaps or deficiencies our minds and bodies have, and these normally are factors that nobody ought to be blamed for. But our willpower (or ""won't-power""), especially when it involves honest interactions with others, is usually seen as an entirely different matter. Throughout the film, both Ennis and Jack lead dishonest lives that harm their spouses, their children, themselves, and each other. (BTW, if you think this is harsh, ask yourself how vigorously you would defend a so-called straight married person who is leading a lie-based double life with one or more lovers outside his/her marriage.)If Ennis and Jack had been presented as malicious men, they would not deserve our pity. Instead, they come across as pitifully weak, essentially careless and thoughtless ageing adolescents. We watch their deceitful, destructive behavior with sorrow, knowing that they are incapable of changing for the better--perhaps foolishly hoping their lives will improve somehow but expecting them to worsen.As far as courage and integrity are concerned, the one bright spot in the picture was when Jack Twist stood up to his domineering father-in-law (ably played by L. D. Newsome); sad to say, immediately he fell back into spinelessness and deceit. And the low point for Ennis was when he became violent with his ex-wife when she revealed that she knew he and Jack did not do any fishing on their fishing trips. Perhaps the most poignant scene is when Ennis asks his daughter, Alma Jr. (Kate Mara), if the man she's engaged to marry is in love with her, and she says that he is.The murder of Jack was skillfully foreshadowed and resonates, of course, with events that occur in many U.S. communities today. Sadly coping with this misfortune, Ennis, in the process of trying to fulfill Jack's wish that his ashes be taken to Brokeback Mountain, learns that his lover had been cheating on him with another man. At the end of the film, we can feel certain that he will never find happiness of any sort in the remainder of his own life.Early in his book WALDEN (1854), Thoreau comments, ""The mass of men lead lives of quiet desperation. What is called resignation is confirmed desperation. From the desperate city you go into the desperate country, and have to console yourself with the bravery of minks and muskrats."" The film BROKEBACK MOUNTAIN almost seems designed to illustrate that grim view of humanity.",N/A
636580,"The skeleton key is a well scripted spiritual supernatural thriller, with a twist at the end that is genuinely surprising. Similar to the Gift and the Others, it is not scary, but does its best to keep the audience on the edge of their seats.Kate Hudson plays Caroline, a live in nurse who is hired by an elderley southern woman in the bayous of Louisiana to care for her dying husband Ben, who has just had a stroke and only has weeks to live. Caroline receives a skeleton key, which opens every door in the house, except for a small room in the attic where Ben had his stroke. Eventually forcing her way into the room, Caroline discovers a world of hoodoo, which at first she brushes off as superstition, but the longer she stays in the house, the more she begins to believe in the magic, and fears Ben is in trouble, believing his illness is all in his head and his wife Violet is trying to force a spell upon him.For the first hour of the film, director Iain Softley manages to scare his audience, but as the twists are slowly revealed, the film becomes less frightening and slightly more predictable. Gena Rowlands and John Hurt work well within the script without showing too much of their true talents, while Kate Hudson really looks like she enjoyed the role of Caroline. Peter Sarsgaard is a pleasure to watch, he is a very fine actor who's character comes across the way audiences would expect, leaving you vulnerable for the twist at the end.Special features include a few short featurette's, deleted scenes and a directors commentary. A trailer, sadly is lacking but includes a couple of bonus trailers.The settings in this film are brilliant, the southern gothic feeling surrounding the movie and the details of the house all combine to create a spooky, tense movie that is very good overall.",N/A

It's a war movie, yet it's not your run-of-the-mill ""hack n' slash gore fest."" It doesn't just string one battle sequence into the next as Hollywood delights in doing.  This film actually tells a meaningful story and the characters here are people, not just ""soldiers"" (there's a big difference).  It's insightful, it doesn't try to make some over-the-top political statement, and it doesn't seem to have any radical agenda which would turn viewers away.

64655,"For any Doors fan, this DVD is a must have. It's got essentially every piece of footage ever shot of Jim Morrison (except for performances appearing on other DVD's). It's got an audio commentary by Ray Manzarek, Robbie Krieger, and John Densmore. And it's one of the most interesting and entertaining music DVD's ever. From a huge fan of The Doors standpoint.It's three separate segments (Dance on Fire, Live at The Hollywood Bowl,and The Soft Parade). ""Dance on Fire"" features the music videos forBreak on Through, People Are Strange, The Crystal Ship, and The Unknown Soldier. As well as Ray Manzarek's new video for ""L.A. Woman"" which captures the tone of the song perfectly. It also features the Ed Sullivan Show performance of ""Light My Fire"". The same one which was the subject of great controversy because Jim said the word ""higher"" on television. It also features a video for ""Roadhouse Blues"" which features some great shots of Morrison. The videos for Break on Through, People Are Strange, The Crystal Ship, and The Unknown Soldier are all great. Then we have the performance at The Hollywood Bowl. This is easily the greatest performance ever captured on film of The Doors. Jim Morrison puts on a brilliant performance, especially during the song ""The Unknown Soldier"" and""The End"" where he improvises a few lines. The final segment ""The Soft Parade"" begins with a montage of video clips to the background song""The Changeling"". Then we see some performances that were part of a PBS special, including the only video in existence of The Doors performing the song ""The Soft Parade"". There's also two interviews that were part of the PBS special where Morrison talks about his poetry/lyrics and accurately predicts the future of recording technology, which is very cool. The video ofJim improving a tribute to Friedirch Nietzsche is very cool too. Also, during the audio commentary we're shown a video of a few girls talking to Jim through the window of a car...Watch where that girls hand goes to...Also, this PBS special was featured on another Doors DVD called ""Soundstage Performances"" and for some odd reason, the video quality on this DVD is ten times better than it was on ""Soundstage Performances"". The audio quality has improved as well. Anyway, as for the Bonus Features; we get to see the two student films that Ray Manzarek directed while attending UCLA.One of them features a shower scene with a man and Ray Manzarek's wife,that Ray refused to cut causing Morrison to gain respect for him. There's some excerpts from John Densmore's one man play, which is actually pretty funny. One reviewer mentioned that it sucks (I'm paraphrasing here) to hearDensmore sing, because he can't. Well, no, he doesn't have a very good voice, but the way he's singing the songs are sarcastic to get the audience laughing. Turns out, Densmore is a pretty witty guy. Then there's an instrumental version of ""The End"" performed by Robbie Krieger, which is really great. It would be cool to her Jim's voice added to it for maximum effect though. There's also an interesting montage of photographs from the ""Morrison Hotel"" sessions with commentary by the photographer. It's pretty funny to learn how Morrison and crew went into a place called The Morrison Hotel and took some pictures when management told them not to. Another thing, I neglected to mention about the main audio commentary with Manzarek, Krieger, and Densmore is that it's obvious that these men loved Jim Morrison and still do. To hear them talk about the events taking place on the tapes with such loving affection is great. Also, I forgot to mention the video's for ""Wild Child"". The song's not my favorite ever, but it's pretty cool to see The Doors perform the song in the studio. Overall, this is the essential Doors DVD for The Doors fanatic. This is the definition of perfection.GRADE: A+",N/A
852702,"DOWNFALL is possibly the best German-language film I have ever seen about the Second World War. It sets a new and impressive standard that will be very hard to beat and serves notice on hack film-makers everywhere that depicting historical figures as cartoon images of good or evil is no longer acceptable with the modern audience.There have been a number of films and programs over the years about Hitler's last days on earth, and if you watched DOWNFALL, you've probably seen one or more them. They vary widely in quality, but the performance which pops into my mind most readily is that of Stephen Berkoff in the 12-part ""War & Remembrance"" mini-series. Berkoff is a fine actor, but he was handcuffed to a script which was predicated on the false image of Hitler as a carpet-chewing lunatic who reacted to the slightest setback by throwing a screaming fit and ordering someone shot. This image was partially an echo of wartime propaganda, and partly stemmed from books penned by surviving generals who wanted to lay the blame for the war's defeat exclusively at Hitler's boots. A more accurate description of the man came from Albert Speer, who said ""Hitler was a genius wrestling with a demon, and the demon won.""This image is precisely the one conveyed by veteran Swiss actor Bruno Ganz, who plays Hitler as a man who in private often took on the role of a kindly, absent-minded professor-grandpa, but when frustrated, thwarted or betrayed (as he frequently was in the last months of his life) showed an inner character reminiscent of a hateful child -- full of misanthropy and an arrogant kind of self-pity. Ganz's performance is simply epic. And when does finally throw the ""Hitler tantrum"" you know is coming, you can't take your eyes off the man. Wow.The decision to depict Hitler as a human being will clearly irritate people who prefer to see him as Satan incarnate. The NEW YORKER review posted here is visible evidence of this, stating: ""The attempt to re-create Hitler in realistic terms has always been morally and imaginatively questionable-a compromise with the unspeakable that borders on complicity with it."" Thankfully, Hirschbiegel and Ganz paid no mind to this type of simple-minded drivel when they made the film. They understood, as the audience does, that to demonize Hitler lets humanity off the hook for producing him in the first place.Thomas Kretschmann (as SS-Gruppenf&uuml;hrer Hermann Fegelein) is another scene-stealer. Kretschmann portrays the handsome, oily opportunist who married Eva Braun's sister and used his SS rank as a license to amass a criminal fortune as a dyed-in-the-wool bastard who is as charming as they come -- just the type of cynical crook that flourished in the moral wasteland that the Third Reich ultimately became, and just the type that was first to jump ship when it all went south.Hitler's secretary, Traudl Junge, is played ably by lovely Alexandra Maria Lara. Like many people around Hitler, she seemed to be unable to form a consistent opinion of him and her inner conflict is well conveyed on the screen. Other terrific performances are delivered by Corinna Harfouch (as creepy Magda Goebbels), Juliane K&ouml;hler (as the very likeable Eva Braun), Christian Berkel (as Prof. Dr. Ernst-G&uuml;nter Schenck, a kindly and heroic SS doctor), Michael Mendl (General der Artillerie Helmuth Weidling, a true soldier in the old German mold, who responds to a threat to have him shot by grasping his Knight's Cross and snarling, ""Do you see this? Don't you dare take that tone with me!"", and sinister nebbish Ulrich Noethen as the back-stabbing Reichsf&uuml;hrer SS Heinrich Himmler. There is also a fine turn by G&ouml;tz Otto as Hitler's SS Adjutant, Hauptsturmf&uuml;hrer Otto G&uuml;nsche, a hulking brute of a man who serves as a two-legged counterpart to Hitler's faithful dog, Blondi.Unlike some German war films I've seen, DOWNFALL's battle scenes are well-directed, and the technical execution of the film is superb. The movie is mercifully light on moralizing, letting the horrifying images on the screen speak for themselves. I have very few criticisms of the film. The interview scenes with the real Traudl Junge, who dutifilly condemns herself for getting involved with Hitler, seem tacked-on, forced, and generally PC. The battle scenes show nothing of the wonton rape committed by Soviet soldiers in Berlin (so many German women were raped that East Berliners later dubbed the statue put up there by communist authorities commemorating Soviet dead as ""the tomb of the unknown rapist""). And the movie is about 15 - 20 minutes too long. But these are very minor points. In DOWNFALL, Oliver Hirschbiegel has directed a film that stands comfortably with the best WW 2 movies of all time. Terrific.",Der Untergang

906403,"When the Spielberg version of ""War of the Worlds"" hit theaters, viewers started submitting their reviews to Amazon. To read them, one would think, ""This must be the worst movie ever made"".  I myself gave it less than 5 stars, mainly because of A) Tom Cruise's incredible invincibility in that film, and B) Dakota Fanning's irritating screeching. I can still hear her screaming in my mind.So, to all those who sent in their movie/DVD reviews slamming that movie, I suggest a cure: see THIS version.  The acting is good enough, but basically it's 93 minutes of NOTHING. Color lenses are overused to great detriment, the pastor agonizes over his shaky faith ad nauseum, and the few action scenes in it are done in ""splatter mentality"" for that truly cheesy feel.

174279,"Fans of McMILLAN AND WIFE and COLUMBO should take a look at their source back in the 1930's and 1940's  with the six B&W; THIN MAN films, starring a never-better William Powell and Myrna Loy as Nick and Nora Charles.  Warner Home Video has them boxed as THE COMPLETE THIN MAN COLLECTION, selling for a reasonable $45 from Amazon.  If you like mysteries with equal parts murder, suspense, alcohol, tender romance, and witty comedy, this DVD set is a must-own.THE THIN MAN (1934) introduces us to the delightful Nick and Nora, who love to drink and solve murders with equal ease, helped by their scruffy dog Asta, who seems to appear throughout the entire series.  The plot is unimportant, something about the title character's disappearance and subsequent murder.  As is the pattern with the whole  THIN MAN series, Nick gathers the whole cast in one room in the climax and identifies the murderer.  The movies are all breezy and fun blends of  mystery, romance, and comedy.  The first got four Oscar nominations, including Best Picture.  W.S. ""One-take Woody"" Van Dyke II directed the first four films in the series and got them made at lightning speed.AFTER THE THIN MAN (1936) has location filming in San Francisco and involves a murder in a nightclub on New Year's Eve.  A young Penny Singleton and James Stewart are among the suspects.ANOTHER THIN MAN (1939) is notable for two things: (1) the birth of Nick, Jr.; and (2) the murder of a Long Island industrialist.  The distinguished writers here are Frances Goodrich and Albert Hackett.SHADOW OF THE THIN MAN (1941) involves a race track murder, and Nick, Jr. is now a toddler.  The writers here are Irving Brecher and Harry Kurnitz.THE THIN MAN GOES HOME (1944) has Nick and Nora going home to Nick's home town of Sycamore Springs to meet his in-laws (Harry Davenport and Lucile Watson).  Sure, enough, there's another murder to solve.  The outstanding writers this time are Robert Riskin and Dwight Taylor.  Richard Thorpe directed.The last film of the series, SONG OF THE THIN MAN (1947), has a murder that takes place during a lavish party on a gambling ship.  It is so good a movie that one wonders whether William Powell and Myrna Loy and the crew knew it would be the final movie.  They sure went out in style with a gem.  Amazingly, it has five credited writers, but has a seamless plot.  Edward Buzzell directed this one.As expected of a prestigious Warner Home Video boxed set, each of these witty and immensely enjoyable mysteries comes with a whole evening of bonuses: ""Passing Parade"" or Robert Benchley short subjects, color cartoons, and theatrical trailers.  Nick and Nora Charles are ageless and set the mold for later TV series, like MR. AND MRS. NORTH in the 1950's and McMILLAN AND WIFE in the 1970's.  Fans of TOPPER will also enjoy THE THIN MAN.  Powell and Loy are an ageless delight.  They often got husband and wife fan mail, even though they were only married on screen.THE COMPLETE THIN MAN COLLECTION includes a seventh, bonus disk called ALIAS NICK AND NORA.  This has affectionate 45 minute Turner Classics biographies of William Powell (""A True Gentleman"") and Myrna Loy (""So Nice to Come Home to"")  for viewers too young to know who they were and always will be.",N/A

From the beginning of the following season there were already the early signs of the short falls that would plague the series in ensuing years (sub plot characters that received too much screen time etc) here was the central cast doing what they did best;fly through the crazy story lines with wonderful panache and a sense of humour and Barbara BelGeddes was in her element in this series slowly dealing with the death of her husband. The following season saw the disruption of the Bobby/Pam marriage which was never fully put back together. Here those two characters suffer their traumas but remain strong and loyal to each other, something that was never the same when the script writers started to play havoc with their story lines. Larry Hagman has a ball in this season , plotting, conniving etc and , as stated, the drama is all about the central characters.One disappointment is the lack of audio commentary and the special is a pretty poor show (a tour of the southfork ranch).",Dallas: Season 5

911711,"I love it when I rent a movie, and I am not quite sure about it. The cover is no hint to what's inside and the back summary sounds really interesting but I have been burned before. Campfire Tales stars a lot of C and D list celebrities, and sometimes that is what makes a film good, because they don't have to overcome the familiarity factor that the A listers struggle with.We have all sat around in our PJ's or around a campfire and told scary stories. It's a rite of passage, which sadly is dying away due to in part the practice of political correctness. This movie takes that tradition, and tweaks it in a surprisingly creepy and shivery way.I love movies that are broken up into 3-4 smaller vignettes, it gives the filmmakers room to really pack the suspense and action in so they don't have to draw out the story to the point of boring the audience. This one is broken down into three main tales, broken up by scenes of the people telling them around a fire. There are twists and surprises, and it's genuinely scary and creepy. It takes old favorites, and blends them with modern references, with enough nostalgia to allow those of us familiar with the tales to see and feel new things. The most awesome thing about this movie is the lack of computer generated effects, like filmmakers long ago who knew how to scare audiences with shadows, story, and acting this movie excels in the beauty of an ""old fashioned"" scare. I completely recommend it to anyone who wants to be pleasantly frightened and entertained.",N/A
798783,"This is a review of the Digiview edition of this movie, which is still available here and there, for very little cash.  The picture quality of this version is OK, about what you'd expect for the price, i.e. a little soft, somewhat grainy, colors not very saturated, but still fine to watch for the story.  The sound is clear mono (if it's stereo, as the box says, I couldn't detect it), with a little static in a couple places but otherwise OK.  The production values for a low budget film are pretty good.  There are at the moment a couple other editions available through Amazon, including one that a reviewer (Luke73) says is better (theGuilty Pleasures/Media Blastersrelease), so it might be worth the extra cash for you if you're particular.Other reviews do a good job explaining the plot.  I'll just add that this is apparently pitched at a high school age audience but is well enough done for older folks to enjoy, if you go in for this kind of thing.  It's a romantic comedy/drama with some serious themes about death treated in a way that's very optimistic, to say the least.  I thought it had some originality, some good humor, no gaping holes that you can't fill in with a little effort, if you're so inclined.  Don't be put off by the singing that runs over the menu at the beginning.  The movie's better than that (though I do wonder why the singing ended up in it at all).  Despite what the box says, this is rated PG, has a ""family film"" feel, with just a little of what might be considered very mild adult situations.If you like this one and want to see something with some similar themes, but pitched at a far higher level, try Truly, Madly, Deeply (unfortunately hard to find at the moment).",N/A

775600,"This movie is an interesting snapshot of some gifted actors in the late 1980's.  Tim Robbins, who appears briefly in a cameo, obviously went on to have a major career.  Crispin Glover found a unique niche of his own as an on- and off-screen eccentric. Suzy Amis appeared in a succession of minor roles and disappeared from movie screens.  But more than that, Twisted in its entirety represents one of the signal artistic successes of that largely reactionary decade.This is a film that can be watched as pure entertainment, and indeed it is hugely entertaining watching the Clevelands lurch from one catastrophe to another.  But beyond that, it is filled with an unforgettable sequence of cinematic images:  the opening shot of Violet dragging a vacuum cleaner across an empty field; the scene where Dylan McDermott deflates a large inflatable dinosaur with a smoldering cigarette butt; the plastic lizard that keeps migrating from one body of water to another; the voyeuristic helicopter; the golf shot from the widow's walk of the mansion; a lawn table floating in a swimming pool, a giant mascot lying in the wreckage spawned by a tornado.  These images are precisely and beautifully composed but they are never presented as obvious symbols or filmic metaphors.  Instead, they just exist alongside the capricious whims and behaviors of the Cleveland kids.And that's not all.  This is one of the few movies I can remember in which there is frequently no distinction between diagetic and non-diagetic musics.  During the early interior scenes, the attentive listener will note that Milt Jackson has been tied up in the Cleveland's basement and administered a large dose of psilocybin--or so it sounds.  Clearly, no Muzak could possibly sound like this, and so the question is: where is it coming from, what is it, and what does it mean?The film of course does have a theme.  It's the familiar old tale of materialism gone awry.  The Clevelands, by virtue of their wealth, have been insulated from both the effects of nature and the consequences of their actions.  A tornado destroys a nearby town while the Cleveland's revival mansion is spared.  Howdy and Mo vacillate between morose withdrawal and sudden violent outbursts, with no concern for those around them, and yet survive in the bowels of their bloated affluence.  And in the end, Lola--the moral center of a movie without a moral center--goes off with the rich and dissembling patriarch rather than remaining with the monstrous children as their surrogate mother.  Can't say I blame her there.This movie would be a leaden failure if it were as depressing as I'm making it sound.  Actually it's exhilarating, funny, brilliantly acted--and allows William S. Burroughs his 15 minutes of screen fame (the target practice came a little late for old Bill's wife).  Add it all up and you have a film that allows cineastes to uncover subtleties while never veering into pomposity or arthouse cliches.  A terrific film from Michael Almereyda.",N/A
801083,"In disk one, Seane Corn teaches in a simple stage alone with beautiful muted music. Some have complained she talks too much, but it's all about the pose, getting in/out, what to watch out for, how to place all body parts (I learned new info even after 4 years & 30 yoga dvds.) Her speaking wasn't hurried or stressed in my opinion at all. She just sounds earnest in wanting to help others do it correctly to avoid injury & also so they don't give up due to not understanding. I think with all her info it helped me to be more present & not let my mind wander to daily worries becasue I breathed the most deep I'd ever done during a yoga workout & even the most deep even when I am trying to breathe deeply. I do like when the yoga teacher speaks since it reminds me to be aware of where my body is & what I am doing.I just wished there was more then just teaching sun salutations of plank, lunges, upward dog, cobra, downward dog; triangle, side angle, warrior 1 & 2, child's pose, twisted triangle, butterfly, bridge, seated leg stretching, etc.Disk 2 has her doing a routine w/the poses you learned, but you can only hear her breath. It's great for keeping rhythm, but it's hard w/o a good voice-over of her telling you what pose to do & maybe quick telling you when to get in/out of it.You can see a preview at gaiam comYoutube under ""Vinyasa Flow Yoga DVD Preview with Seane Corne""",N/A

983400,"And one hell of a great movie, 4.5/5 stars.I've never been much of a Paul Walker fan, too many 'look at me aren't I pretty and heroic' type roles, Into the Blue, Timeline, etc, kind of soured me on him.  But that being said, his performance in this flick, not to mention that of the entire cast, totally blew me away.Initially I thought this was going to be just another shoot 'em up mob movie, happily I was wrong.  The primary storyline has Walker playing a low level mob guy, Joey, charged with getting rid of his boss Tommy's (played by the deliciously dark Johnny Messner) pistol that was used to, unknowingly at the time, kill a bunch of dirty cobs.  When the gun disappears all hell breaks loose as Joey races against the clock to recover the gun before Tommy and the rest of the mob boys find out it was ever gone.  On that level, it coulda just been another lame shoot 'em up movie, but the subplot involving the screen stealing Cameron Bright's character, and his involvement with the missing gun, is what truly makes the movie take off and sets it apart from action movies of this genre.That being said, there are a few lags in the pace during the middle of the film, but not enough to truly detract from the film.  Some people have commented on the pedophile couple possibly pushing the dark theme of the movie too far, but I personally thought it fit right in.  While the rest of the characters in the film were blatantly dark, links to the mob, prostitution, etc, some of them also have their redeeming qualities.  Then we have this couple that show up in their bright colored clothes, eerily cheerful demeanor, and they end up being quite possibly the most evil people in the film. Looks can be deceiving.All in all this was a great movie to watch, although the ending was a little bit predictable, and the reason I'd give it only 4.5 out of 5 stars.  It's still worth watching, check it out and you'll understand what I mean.",N/A
602911,"Frida is luscious eye candy from beginning to end; so beautiful it could be enjoyed without sound.  This is due to its subject, its star, and its director, Julie Taymor, who also gave us the astounding Titus.  (If you have not yet seen Titus, do so before finishing this review - it is an art director's tour de force on a par with Brazil.)Regardless of where one falls on the political spectrum, one can't help but be intrigued by the fascinating, and certainly unconventional, people of Frida.  Diego Rivera, played superbly by Alfred Molina, boasted the traditional faults of great artists, (narcissism, thoughtless cruelty, obsessive egotism), while showcasing some exceptional ones, (art as propaganda device, naive political idealism).  His flaws were as large as his murals, but he was never dull.In addition to starring as Frida, Salma Hayek co-produced the film and pretty much moved heaven and earth to get it made.  How wonderful that she did.  Hayek has traveled under a Hollywood curse, appearing in one dreadful picture after another.  This is clearly the film she wants to be remembered by, and her performance is note perfect.  The story is so full of pain and passion that it could easily become maudlin and goopy, but Hayek never lets that happen.  Her Frida is heart and steel all at once - amazing.The take home message, if there is one, is that great art is never free.  In the case of Rivera, others paid the price; he fed off others like a greedy child.  In the case of Frida Kahlo, she herself paid the price, digging further and further into her own pain and laying it bare in a way that is almost unspeakably brave.  There are moments of magic realism in Frida, where we move imperceptibly from the filmed image to paintings and vice versa - if nothing else this reveals the paintings for what they were, astounding autobiographical statements.There are a few missteps.  The liaisons with Trotsky and Josephine Baker feel almost obligatory, as if a form is being filled out.  But blemishes this small are overshadowed by so many splendid moments, for example, when Rivera's dog urinates on his painting and he responds by calling him the best art critic in Mexico.Beyond highly recommended - must viewing.",Frida

929283,"The movie told of the early days of a small town in France under German occupation. How the townsfolk responded and reacted to the shrewd and manipulative German leadership? For one, the mayor and the business owners were speculators and still made good money out of the situation. To the middle class, like the railway executive George (George Sanders), peace was so important that they cooperated with the Germans as much as they disliked them. For most folks, they made do with the scarcity of food and milk by paying a hefty price for petty portions in the black market. Still underground resistance came from the educators (the Jewish headmaster and the beloved school teacher Louise (Maureen O'Hara)), who ensured that the seed of freedom was uninhibited in the minds of the school children, and also the pragmatists, who printed propagandas and orchestrated sabotage.The one who made the complete transformation was the older school teacher Albert Lory (Charles Laughton) - a mama's boy who was terrified by air raid, choked by smoking a cigarette, shook before the Germans and unable to declare his love for Louise. His unflattering face, timidity and senior age gave him a big handicap; he was an impossible candidate for a hero. Yet impossibilities are improbable possibilities in desperate times. Imprisoned for allegedly throwing a bomb, released but then accused of being an informant for the Germans, being put in a murder trial and offered his freedom by the German if he played properly his new role as the new headmaster. Mr. Lory was relieved for this arrangement until he saw the end of the highly respectable former headmaster. Hereafter, a hero was born.Charles Laughton not only made the change plausible, he amplified and emphasized it with his superb acting. To his credit, Mr. Lory was as cowardly then as he was heroic now. The two speeches Charles Laughton made in the murder trial, before and after the German's offer, epitomized their lives under the German occupation. His last lesson, albeit a short one, to the school children was his one chance to win them over - for the future of the country lay in their hands. And he delivered the message across the classroom with conviction and power, as only a hero could.Thanks to the director and the script, Mr. Lory underwent change not because of his love for Louise but for his country. He needed not be handsome and young to be the leading hero, as present movies would undoubtedly prefer. Maureen O'Hara, as Louise, lent her good sense, strength of character and beauty to make the heroine complete. Una O'Connor, as Mrs. Lory who betrayed a young man for his son's freedom, was impeccable.More to that, Mr. Lory accused the mayor who, even though from poor background, once assumed power, was reluctant to relinquish what he had at the expense of their countrymen. How true this still is from developing to developed countries all over the world. Should countrymen resort to sabotage so that foreign occupiers were engaged at all fronts and stretched thin? This is a double-edged sword which could work against the evil as well as the peacekeeping force. This is a movie who raised provoking questions rather than offering solutions.",N/A
479379,"Rivaling ""Slapshot"" as the best hockey movie in cinema history, ""Mystery, Alaska"" provides enough action, comedy, and realistic sports scenes to satisfy even a moviegoer not fond of sports movies.Between Burt Reynolds and Russell Crowe, the acting weight is sufficient; however, several B-listers and no-namers turn in a convincing and entertaining performance.  The Mystery hockey team is a cast of characters that do not disappoint; in fact, they are down-right hilarious.  Stevie Weeks, the young upstart, can skate like the wind blows; Tree is the bully enforcer, albeit a little slow mentally; Skank lives up to his name and reputation, but plays tough hockey; and the Winneka brothers move and play as if they have ESP.  The star of the team, however, is Connor Banks, a hockey stud who can blast pin-point slapshots all day.  Due to a Sports Illustrated article touting the team's skills, the once in a lifetime opportunity to play the New York Rangers presents itself.What ensues is the transformation of a small town, high spirits and hijinks, a hilarious National Anthem by Little Richard, a great hockey battle, a perfectly brilliant cameo by Mike Myers, and a great ending.I highly recommend this movie to all, and particularly to sports enthusiasts.",Mystery Alaska VHS
686422,"It is amusing that the one reviewer was turned off by the fact that this movie, The Fairy Princess, should have fairies in it.  The movie is in fact fast-paced with the plot taking a new direction every few minutes.  If you're bored by this, you should be playing video games.  It's not at all predictable.  I thought of several possible endings (and could give you one that would be better than the one they used).Small children as well as grownups should delight in this film.  It has a pleasant story.  The casting, for a change, is good.  The child is appealing.  The father is okay.  The fairy is quite appealing.  In fact, the movie avoided all of the mistakes usually found in family fare.The only reasons I withhold the highest rating are the scene at the school play where the midgets dance.  It wasn't amusing and went on too long.  And the rock music during the birthday party.  It was inappropriate for this kind of film.  Also, rock music at the end while the credits are passing, but you can stop the DVD at that point.  Too bad, though, because good music at the end can be a nice cap for a pleasant experience.Bottom line: don't miss adding this one to your collection.  Even at regular price, it would be worth it.

862473,"I first need to say, if it weren't for the DVD and all of its features, ANYWHERE BUT HOME would have gotten three stars. I say this because, Evanescence does not sound as good live as they do in the studio.THE CD:This contains the audio to the rock band's performance live in Paris. It also has the album's most beautiful and stand out track: ""Missing"".THE CONCERT:The overall sound balance for this rock band is way off for this performance and the distorted guitars tend to drown out anything in the form of a musical line. Amy Lee also has her share of troubles for this performance. She can sing her high loud notes pretty well, but her lower ones tend to be in a constant use of pedal tones. Late into the performance, Amy's voice cracks and even starts to give out on her. She does however, know how to work the crowd. The bands newer tracks are well performed, and the covers they perform sound better than their own work. This is good and bad; it shows that Evanescence can play pretty well, but they need a lot more practice playing live and communicating with each other live. The best part to this concert is getting to see the beautiful Amy Lee perform and add new and very interesting introductions to some of the band's songs.Awesome performances include:""Thoughtless""""Breathe No More""""Farther Away""""Bring Me to Life""""Whisper""DVD FEATURES:This disc is awesome because it has so many features. It of course has Evanescence's performance in Paris. It also has music videos for ""Going Under"", ""Bring Me to Life"", ""Everybody's Fool"", and ""My Immortal"". There is also a hidden video icon of Evanescence's band symbol. When this is activated, another live performance of ""Bring Me to Life"" is played. The disc also has tons of rehearsal, bloopers, and on the road footage; including Evanescence's tour with Seether. The credits also have the audio to Evanescence's newest track ""Missing"".

876512,"An effective ghost story should have an air of mystery to it: why is there a ghost? What purpose does the ghost have in haunting a particular place or person? A modicum of pathos is also important for a truly emotional turn of the screw, as a ghost cannot only be vindictive or vengeful, but must have sadness about it; something that we can empathize with that will make the haunting all the more tragic, as well as spooky. Gore also must be kept to a minimum, as an effective ghost story relies on creating and sustaining a balanced mood of tension. Too much gore and the balance shifts into rapid moments of revulsion and anxiety, whereas a good ghost story relies on impression and subtlety, implying more than is actually shown.Whispering Corridors is a ghost story that expertly balances social commentary regarding a South Korean girls' school (the why), pathos from the duality of the ghost as it moves between normalcy (daylight) and vengeance spirit (night), and the symbolic use of blood to tell a moving tale of loss, redemption, and continued loss.It opens with our ghost prowling the girl's school grounds on a dark and stormy night (I know, but it was dark and stormy), ready to exact vengeance on a teacher that mistreated her. The teacher has discovered the ghost's secret, and thus seals her fate. The discovery of the murdered teacher is done with cinematic style; first showing the face of the student as she reacts to seeing Mrs. Parks' hanging body from a walkway, then showing the back of the student as she views the body, with her head blocking our view, and finally, the camera 'steps' to the left of the student, to show the hanging body in the farground, and the back of the student in the foreground, side by side. Other student's reactions are then shown in still shots as they come upon the body. Muted colors throughout the film lend a stark, rather cold aspect to the events that unfold in the girl's school, putting more emphasis on the callous indifference and mistreatment of the students and their emotional needs. The male teachers in the school come off being chauvinistic and condenscending in the all-girl classroom, and become violent toward the students with little provocation.One teacher in particular, Mr. Oh (Mad Dog, as the students call him), with his stick and sarcastic and unstable temperament, reminded me of a math teacher I suffered through one semester with. He also carried a stick and whacked students at little provocation. Learning by intimidation and threat, whether in a South Korean all-girls school, or a North American all-boys school, is not conducive to a true learning environment. It is in this restrictive, competitive, and uncreative classroom environment that our ghost is born and haunts by day and by night; by day, as one of the students that has attended class for years without any teacher noticing her, and by night, as a vengeance spirit, murdering those teachers that mistreated her and any other girl.Pathos is brought into the story by the ghost's need to be normal, to relive her classroom life again and again in hopes of getting it right. She does not want to hurt anyone, but those annoyingly vindictive and sadistic teachers keep mistreating the students, and thus bring about the vengeance spirit at night, to exact revenge. While the vengeance ghost appears only three times in the film, each occurrence is filled with supernatural events that build into a violent attack that is bloodily carried out, but not gorily so. Blood is used symbolically here, not for shock value, especially at the end, when the classroom becomes inundated with blood as the ghost finds release and stops her haunting.I should point out there is a sequelization-antic (aka 'not over yet folks') used at the end of the film, but in this case, it fits perfectly within the logic of the story, and serves to heighten the tragedy that the film's social commentary is focusing on: how the South Korean girls school system is repressive, demoralizing, and, for some, downright fatal. How sad that this commentary can also be said for our own school system.",N/A

969676,"Season 3 finds the beloved couple detective show reaching new heights . . . and unforunately a handful of lows!  There are no major changes to the format or cast this year.  The only change is that the pair are now finding themselves in many more exotic locales than just L.A (2 out-of-town in San Fran and Vegas, and 6 out-of-country in Mexico, Malta, Ireland, and England).As I said, there are a few misfires in this season, including what may be the most annoying and embarrasing episode of the series, STRONGER THAN STEEL, in which Laura tries to clear the man who played a super hero on TV during her childhood.  The whole Atomic Man bit with its weak attempt to recreate the then burgeoning sci-fi / comic convention craze just comes off as a laughable spoof, and among so many fine episodes, it sticks out like a sore thumb.Also painful are episodes that include athletes (Whitey Ford and Micky Mantle) and actors (Dorothy Lamour, Virginia Mayo, and Lloyd Nolan) playing themselves.  Nothing is worse than actors or athletes trying to ""be themsevles.""  The one with the actors is particularly bad, as it is obvious they pulled these three out of retirement with a giant wad of cash - it is clear the actors think the script is rubbish (and it is, with some of the LAMEST lines given to them) and as such they put NO effort into their lifeless roles.  The athletes - well, there is a reason they are swinging bats instead of winning oscars!!But, these few low points aside, there are also some FANTASTIC episodes, such as Steele's bout with amnesia in which he becomes a movie-trivia spouting fool while trying to remember why he is in Ireland - the pair trying to protect two clueless singing-telegram girls - Steele being attacked by cooks who think he is a ruthless restaurant critic - and Steele trying to reach out to a young street pick-pocket, in whom he sees the child he once was.But two episodes this season stand out as ""all-time best"" candidates.  The first is DICED STEELE which chronicles Steel attempting to bankrupt a suspected thief at a game of cards to lure him into betting the merchandise he stole.  Of course, Steele LOSES the game AND the $150,000 dollars the insurance company loaned him!  This sends the two off to Vegas to try to recover both money AND merchandise.  Meanwhile, a relentless investigator from the insurance company stumbles upon Steele's shady past, and thus we are introduced to Norman Keyes, who would return several times in season 4, always nipping at Steele's heels!The other stand-out is STEELE IN THE CHIPS - an episode co-written by Zimbalist herself, and so nearly a screw-ball comedy that the network was hesistant to air it for a long time.  It concerns several people going to lethal means to procure or destroy the recipe for a 1-calorie chocolate chip cookie, and includes an extended chase in the end taken straight from the playbook of IT'S A MAD, MAD, MAD, MAD WORLD!  This episode also brings us an early glimpse of Geena Davis (sporting a nice eighties-style Tennis outfit!!)Season 3 was definitely the show at its zenith.

946942,"Irwin Allen's shortest series was possibly his most ambitious: an adventure wherein its two protagonists, Drs. Tony Newman (James Darren) and Doug Phillips (Robert Colbert), are flung throughout time, allowing them to coincidentally arrive at important historical dates, real and imaginary.  All of the producer's trademarks are present: lots of flashy bells and whistles, gobs of pyrotechnics, pseudo science, stereotypical roles of men and women, political incorrectness, and cost-conscious use of studio stock footage and music.Sure, there are abundances of plot inconsistencies and errors but Allen was more concerned with making entertaining and audience-pleasing fare than accuracy or even logical storytelling.  Strangely enough, it's ironic that in 1966, when the show debuted, the country was in the in the midst of the Civil Rights movement, the beginnings of America's involvement in the war in southeast Asia, and the successes of the space program.  Only the latter is addressed in any of the episodes, Allen preferring to take the ""easy road"" and not tackling social issues of the day.  A couple of installments hit at social commentary with a line or two but most of the series is pure escapism.The special effects, mostly in the Time Tunnel complex itself, are impressive when one considers the time of the show's production.The main stars, along with Whit Bissell, John Zaremba, and Lee Meriwether, do their best to make the show's impossible premise believable, even wih the stilted and, occasional, laughable dialogue.

His descriptions of family life, marriage, & the basic humor in everyday life were remarkably true & funny. I have friends who laughed so hard during his litany of differences between the first year of marriage & the twenty first that they actually had tears in their eyes. Indeed both the wives & husbands appeared to learn from his musings. How often can we say that from a comedy routine?His marriage seems to describe 80% of today's marriages? Guys can be clueless, & do fake incompetance to avoid certain tasks. Lets face it, guys don't really want to make all the decisions {like females would ever let us?} One thing he said is so true that females may find it unnerving? ""If it was not for sex they really would be in trouble, even though most would never admit it. Yes, even single males know how to play the game. His 3 basic male needs-food, sex, & sleep are spot on. We have fewer needs. Ladies,  why is that a negative?Maybe, males are more evolved than we get credit for, I'm not sure?He did leave out sports, but I guess we could survive without them?His having to shop for female toiletries with his son shows just how unsettled we males get over such private matters. I remember being 12 like his son & not having ""the discretionary gene he described."" I embarressd my father in exactly the same situation.

829879,"I did like this movie. My purpose in watching it was to get a general outline--or at least a feel--for what the Book of Mormon contains. Additionally, in fairness, the movie should be compared with other movies produced by religious houses, such as Ten Clouds (Left Behind I, II, & III, etc.). In this light, the film fairs well. The acting is reasonably believable, though occasionally modern dialogue slips into this historic drama. The effects, while probably subpar by Hollywood standards, are high-medium for religious films. OK, the scene where Nehi ""shocks"" his brothers was pretty feeble!The plot is the key here. While the target audience would certainly be primarily Mormon, the LDS church surely hopes that some non-members will see the film and become curious. In that vein, the film does a decent job of presenting a story that very few actually know. In doing so, the story feels very much like one that might have been done about Joseph, or the 10 Commandments, etc. In fact, some of the parallels were clearly intentionally. This story is meant to feel like a biblical epic.I was surprised to learn that the movie came out in 2002. Nearly five years, and still no part II? Like Left Behind, future episodes are likely to be direct-to-dvd. The big let down for fans who like this series, is that there seems to be a distinct possiblitity it will not see its way to completion.Bottom-line: Three stars for a religious movie that compares favorably with others in the genre, and succeeds in creating the feel of a biblical epic. Detractions are occasional uneven scenes, and the possiblity, even likelihood, that this series will not be completed.",N/A

400205,"Before I review, I'd like to clear something up: I am a very latecomer in seeing this movie. I was introduced to the Ghost in the Shell franchise through the new Anime series airing on Adult Swim, Ghost in the Shell: Standalone Complex. I absolutely love that show, and so I figured eventually I'd have to get around to seeing the movie, which I knew full well shares no connection with the show. They're both seperate interperetations of the comic series of the same name, (which I have not read, so I don't know which is more accurate) but the TV series is exponentially better than this movie in almost every concievable way.There are many things I don't like about this movie, the biggest being poor pacing. The plot for the movie is actually surprisingly straightforward once you cut away all the filler, but that's the biggest problem. There's not really enough story to last a full-length feature, because it seems almost like it was originally written with the intention of being a 30 minute short. And since they didn't have the budget to load the movie up with action scenes (there are barely any, and they aren't very impressive for the most part) they had to slow the story down with drawn out conversations that you won't understand more than 60% of, and camera shots that last for what feels like minutes where we're looking at either nothing, or a woman's nipples. That's not cinematic artistry, that's being either lazy or perverted.The animation itself isn't even that good, especially considering that this is was a theatrical release from only 10 years ago. It's choppy, and there's not really a whole lot of detail (except when it comes to women's nipples). Looking at just the animation, if I didn't know better, I'd have thought this movie was an OVA from the 1980's.The only thing I can really say I liked about this movie was that it was Ghost in the Shell. It's probably kind of like how I didn't see the 1989 Batman movie until years after I'd been spoiled by Batman the Animated Series, and couldn't bring myself to like it for any reason other than that it was Batman. Everything about the TV series is superior to this movie: the animation, the stories, the character developement, the production values... I could go on for an entire page about how much better the TV series is.In short, if you're you're at all interested in the GITS franchise, do yourself a favor and rent the DVDs of the TV show instead. You'll find a lot to love, but I can't say the same about the movie. My dream is that someday Alex Proyas will give us a GITS movie that lives up to what I would hope for after watching Standalone Complex.",N/A
710537,"This is perhaps the only film I would ever give five stars to for failing to live up to my expactations. This may be the very best over simplification of the Lewis and Clark jorney we are ever likely to see and as such it serves as a wonderful introduction to the subject.Produced as a imax film, it doesn't have the ""National Geographic"" feel and the visual impact is striking.  Artistically the producers limited the story by condensing, skipping material, and reducing the overall scale by showing fewer people than took part.  All of that falls under the catogory artistic licence so i didn't really mind.What most disappointed me was the failure to properly portray the impact this trip by a handful had on the entire country.  It was not simply that they had succeeded, but that they fired the imagination of a nation and made the leaders and people realize the true expanse of a country just in its youth.As others have said - if the oportunity comes to see it in Imax - don't miss it!",N/A

401659,"Although I wasn't a fan of Grammer's TV shows like Frasier, I thought he did a great job in this movie. As the captain of a slipshod, rebellious, dilatory crew and an even more dubiously seaworthy old sub, Grammer really carried the whole movie and comes off with the scuttlebutt's share of the comedy, too. The comments about ""polishing the ol' torpedo"" and ""You're almost out of uniform, ensign,"" were worth the price of the flick by themselves. And the rest of the crew did a good job too, mostly unknowns who seemed to get into the spirit of the whole comedic farce as well. Although it didn't get very good reviews, don't listen to the critics, rent it and see for yourself.By the way, if you're a fan of old sub movies like me, such as Run Silent, Run Deep, The Enemy Below, Torpedo Alley, and Das Boot, not to mention The Hunt for Red October, and of subs in general, you might like the Dummies Guide to Submarines which is a really cool book about subs and how they work and operate. Written by a protege of Admiral Rickover in the nuclear naval program, it has many fascinating facts and stories about submarines by an officer who's been there, as well as some stories about the legendary Rickover, who was infamous for being as cantakerous as he was brilliant (he told the author that although he passed engineering and technical requirements--which most applicants didn't--his education in the humanties was inadequate, and that he expected a book report on a Shakespeare play each month :-)).",Down Periscope VHS
641329,"Other reviewers have found Spielberg's interpretation of events surrounding the aftermath of the '72 Olympic murders of the Israeli athletes as being ""politically correct"" and ""safe.""  Well, I, for one, beg to differ in that the director has taken a controversial story and given us a film that doesn't show either side as being the ""hero"" or the ""villain.""Though much of the world condemned the actions of Black September on that dark day in Munich, the ""speculation"" of the retaliatory actions of Israel could equally have been criticized.  As depicted here, the pursuit of the assassins is relentless with a cast of wonderful actors displaying the various personas of a ""hit squad.""Eric Bana deserved an Oscar nomination as the assassin with a concious while co-star Daniel Craig is memorable as Bana's partner-in-arms with a penchant for R & B music.  Craig shows a menacing air that might do him well as he takes on the role of ""James Bond"" in the forthcoming ""Casino Royale.""Geoffrey Rush gives another outstanding performance as the man that sends Bana and company on their mission.  Ciaran Hinds, Mathier Kassovitz, and Hanns Zischler are equally impressive as the remaining three members of the quintet.  Michael Lonsdale and Mathier Amalric shine as the father-son team that provides information for the Israelis at a very expensive cost.Spielberg's direction has never been tighter and the location filming and cinematography is flawless.  Tense moments abound with realistic situations, especially when the ""best laid plans"" go awry.Spielberg stalwart John Williams provides an extremely subdued score, never overshadowing the on-screen events.There is no wonder that the film received five Oscar nods.Though it's too bad that it didn't win any of them.",Munich

Palance gives a somber, but at the same time also a ferocious portrayal of the legendary count and warrior prince.This movie has a nice gothic feel to it, and most of the actors are decent. That said, I don't think that younger people will enjoy this film, since it doesn't contain a lot of action and special effects. Remember that it was made in the 70's.

A cameo I noticed from the first movie, was the black guy that got killed in both movies. What was the use to bring someone back from the previous movie, just to kill them again. Maybe the movie was trying to reach its qouta with the minorities on the cast LOL. I actually like this one better then the first one. I liked how it had built up suspense by showing some of the complex tentants watching the same special on tv about the demons, and all of the tentants come in contact with each other in times of need when the demons went on a blood feast. The birth of the baby was REALLY RAMDOM, and so was the scene that showed sally boyfriend and his friends getting in a wreak with the lil boy's (who left alone in the complex) parents.( He was wayyyy to young to be by himself at late night) It had NOTHING TO DO WITH THE DEMONS IN THE COMPLEX. I can see if they actually arrived at the complex and became a demon or helped out which would make more sense. I can say NO ONE (or NOTHING lol) WAS SPARED from being turned into a demon.

500230,"This was REALLY only meant for people that like recreating the past.  Remember when Oprah attempted life as a woman in the 1700s?  Civil War recreationists would like this too.  Still, this is completely a niche market.  Remember how the Simpsons tried a show like this and the show got cancelled?  I was sitting here bored watching a show that implies ""Wasn't eighteenth century life so interesting and admirable?""  This is 90 minutes on one historian speaking on one historical document.  I appreciate this as a contribution to women's studies.  But otherwise, yawn!This does mention spicy topics such as premarital sex and rape allegations.  The historian can document health epidemics and property boundaries.  Still, I would have like to seen this midwife's life contextualized.  For example, how and when did she learn to read and write?  I imagine most women in the 1700s did not have those skills.  The work suggests that the midwife was not stigmatized for her job and made good money from it, so why didn't she pass this trade on to her own daughters?  The work does show her tracking in snow.  Still, Maine, to this day, is icy cold.  Did she smoke meat?  How did her family and other family survive during long, oppressive winters?  Each woman and girl here always has her hair covered.  I imagine this was in order not to catch or spread lice, but the work never says.  When the midwife dies, her children and grandchildren are at her bedside.  I heard this was a common practice back then, but the documentary never says.  The historian notes that the midwife recorded her tasks and not her feelings.  Is this an example of the Protestant work ethic?  Again, things should have been fleshed out.Again, do not view this if you aren't in the targeted niche.","Midwife's Tale, A VHS"
945392,"I'm really looking forward to this DVD release. A lot of ""Battlestar Galactica"" fans have had negative things to say about Season 2.0, Volume 2. I agree with some of the criticism, but not all of it. The one real problem I have with this show is that most episodes are very predictable and many of the storylines just keep recycling themselves. Almost every episode in this season seems to revolve around Adama, Starbuck, or Apollo being in mortal peril...that gets kind of old after a while. However, in spite of that, this is still a great show. It's so FRACKIN' INTENSE! A lot of important things happened during this season involving Adama's clash with the commander of the Pegasus ship, President Roslin's terminal cancer diagnosis, Starbuck and Apollo's personal relationships and professional development, Gaius Baltar's rise to power, and the cylon's infiltration into what is left of the human race.I don't want to spoil the season for anyone who hasn't seen it yet, but there are plenty of ""shock and awe"" moments to look forward to. Beloved characters will die, surprise relationships will form, and the season finale cliffhanger is unlike anything you've ever seen in the series before!

648772,"The first half of the movie is well done. The characters are well developed and the imagery is extraordinary. My only problem with this part of the movie is that there are too many songs crammed into it. You know that Mumble is going to be different, and when he does arrive on the Earth, the film does a grand job in making the other penguins exclude him for his lack of singing skill, and we quickly feel sorry for the young Mumble, who is thrust into a nasty world straight from birth. The start of the film is very touching, but lacks on the comedy and general interest, and therefore, the film could not have continued in that way forever. And it quickly changed - with the film being best having Mumble as a teenager. He then realizes that people are sick of his uniqueness now and that he is making the others feel humiliated, and that he could well be on his way to an early death.The film started to have more comedy from this point on - thank God for the Latino penguins. If it wasn't for them, the film could hardly even be called a comedy. Though it is meant to be touching, some of the action is extremely high-octane - when the penguins slide down cliffs into the sea, it makes for an overwhelming experience on the silver screen, and it may even thrill you. Though this film tries to be a masterpiece with its important message and generally effective characters and script, it is the animation that makes it brilliant - it is easily one of the best I have seen this year. It is all beautiful, and it truly raises the bar for animation in the future. The film is full of star-studded voice talents, from the youthful Elijah Wood to the irresistibly comedic Robin Williams, who entertains the audience with a feast of accidents and sessions of improvisation.Happy Feet isn't exactly a monumental film and probably won't have any effect on the environmental problems we suffer now, but the animation and story is good. Children will enjoy the clever animation and fun music. The story is a bit too detailed for younger children but the older members of the family will follow it. The movie is longer than what most children will sit through but the love story is endearing and the adventure is thrilling. If you liked March of the Penguin's, you'll love this movie.

What Firefly did was create a great ensemble cast that play their roles so perfectly, I still marvel at it every time I watch an episode. I knew I was going to love it when the Pilot episode opened with Wash (the ship's pilot) playing with plastic dinosaurs while waiting for the crew to finish a 'heist.'Serenity extends the story and fills in some of the past. The effects are well done (it's not Lord of the Rings, but they're good and consistent with the series). There is great action. But it's the cast and their relationships that make this movie (and series) so special. It's not that the acting is Oscar quality per se, it's that the characters are so real. This is in contrast to the last three Star Wars films where the acting is so stilted and wooden, you don't care who gets killed or about anything else for that matter (note that I loved the original trilogy for the same reason as Firefly/Serenity..the way the cast chemistry worked). Humor, anger, angst, sadness...all of them ring true in the way they play off each other.Mal (the captain) is perfect as the ex-soldier who cares for his crew, but tolerates no challenge to his authority (but has a good sense of humor). Ron Glass does a great job as Shepard Book, it's hard not to like Kaylee the engineer and my favorite, tough guy Jayne (Alec Baldwin) who is by far the funniest character (""Uhhhh, I been workin' on a new plan. What say we shoot her first."").At the end of the day, that's what made this film/series so special. The characters are genuine and easy to care about. There is just that chemistry that's present in any good series/film between the cast. Every episode provided good action and comic relief. If I had to use one word to decribe the series/film, it would be ""fun.""I own over 600 DVDs and am a pretty serious movie buff.

Nonetheless, it is inspirational and fun to watch: an excellent adventure tale.The movie reminded me of ""White Fang"" with the winter scenery and the young hero, played by MacKenzie Astin, looking and sounding much like Ethan Hawke. The story was simply about a dog-sled race in the early part of the 20th century.The picture is beautifully shot, especially the train scenes, and looks very good on DVD. The villains in here aren't as despicable as in other films, so it's more pleasant to watch. I enjoyed the entire story except for the whistling at the finish line which was a bit stupid, but that's minor.This is one of Disney's best live-action films.",Iron Will VHS
891100,"First of all, I didn't really have any high expectations when I started watching this movie. For one thing, it went straight to video, and that's the first sign that it's going to suck. We all know they try to make it sound so glamorous on the box, and when you take it home it's trash. I'm glad I was wrong about this one. Let me just say that the first 2 films were not only original, but great, however the 3rd installment of the franchise..""The Ascent"" blew big time. With that being said, I wouldn't bother to compare it to the first 3 prophecies because this is an entirely different war this time around. This film is about The Lexicon, which is basicly a book that finishes the story of Revelation. This book is suppose to tell you about the real forthcoming of the anti-christ and the apocalypse. It's suppose to give you the real facts on how the world is suppose to end, but the book isn't finished because it's still awaiting dictation from God himself. I love movies with storylines or plots that have depth. I don't wanna waste an hour and a half of my life on something predictable. Anyway, Kari Wuhrer is a good actress, and she does a good job playing the ""chosen one"" handpicked by the angel Simon himself as the personal guardian of the Lexicon. Meanwhile, she's being pursued by the demon Belial who wants the book. Belial jumps from body to body in the quest for the book. Not only that, Satan himself is actually on Earth trying to track her down, but in this case, he wants to protect her and the book (for his own selfish reasons of course). Either way, I suggest that you watch the Prophecy:Forsaken immediately after this one in order to get the whole story. It's explained in that film why she was chosen, and why Satan aided in the protection of the guardian.",The Prophecy - Uprising
835516,"I loved her since her first DVDs ""Hula Workout"" though those used cutsy 60s music & added 60s american dance moves but still have a lot of authetic hula dancing.These ""Island Girl"" hula workouts are more authentic. Just like her other ones, you get a great workout, your abs burn, your hips, legs get a nice workout. It's all authentic dance moves with some added quick squats, etc. added in so you barely notice it for adding toning. The authentic drum Hawaiian music is beautiful & does keep you stimulted too keep going just like a dance/rock beat would.I had no trouble following & learning the steps, there are plenty of dance DVDs that I have had trouble with, but she breaks everything down well & shows it slowly several times before speeding it up.

642046,"First, there is the contrived thriller plot, which drags on way too long, lacking in the energy it takes to manage the required twist at the end. Second, Melissa George (who reminds me of the young Sharon Stone) and Jennifer Aniston should have traded parts. The sultry George would have been much better as the adulterous Lucinda (what a great name), while Aniston, who really does better in the girl-next-door parts, was custom-made for Charles' wife Deanna. I understand that Aniston has more star power and probably wanted the bad-girl role as a stretch, but someone should have warned her off it.As it stands, Aniston just cannot be brought to deliver in her flirtatious part with any believability, a problem that undermines the film's very premises. She seems unable to decide whether to play the part with Hepburn-like wit or Taylor-like seething sexual steam (which unfortunately she does not possess). Of course, the script doesn't give her much guidance; her woodenly delivered ""I think I want to f*** you"" is a case in point. How was she supposed to say this line? It's anyone's guess. Also, it is just very hard to believe that the madly handsome Clive Owen would risk everything for Lucinda, especially when he has the smoldering Deanna waiting at home. Owen as Charles brings some power and intelligence to the task, but he is just not given enough to work with, and he does a pretty poor job of tamping down his irrepressible British accent.The film is mildly entertaining, and just a little scary. It could have been much better.",N/A

706390,"The quotes from this 5-star series are endless. The title of this review is a lonely sample of the hilarious zingers that Fred (Redd Foxx) would make in reference to Aunt (""watch it sucker!"") Esther.Laughs abound in these wonderfully crafted episodes that covered all issues from family values to cultural difference and made great fun of every subject.Sanford and Son was way ahead of its time for a 1972 debut. Creator Norman Lear (The Jeffersons, Good Times and more) had a great formula with All In The Family, and he applied it perfectly to Sanford and Son.If you're unfamiliar with this sitcom, bottom line is that Fred runs a junkyard with his son, Lamont, and Fred's wife passed away leaving the two men to also run the household. But who could possibly not have at least seen a rerun of this classic show with its memorable theme tune?This collection is as ageless as it is priceless. Some of the season 3 and season 4 episodes are without Redd Foxx due to contract issues, and that was a shame and absolutely effected the genius of the show. Thank goodness it was only a total of 8 or 9 episodes.And, speaking of price, at the time of this writing it seems a bit cheaper if you buy all 6 DVD seasons separately instead of the 6-season box set that Amazon is offering.Either way, hit the add to cart button.

Jr. is then sent with the job of finding where Bly is held up and bring him to justice, and finish the job his father had started.While Bly was never actually captured (mainly due to the cancellation of the series.), the plot sometimes strays away from the sci-fi aspect and plays out more like a regular western and focuses on the core element ofJr. chasing after clues for Bly.The cast is memorable, and plays its part as it should. Some of the jokes are satiracle, that some people may not catch, while you have your standard Bruce Campbell type jokes.Sound is as it was when the show first aired on fox.

Michael Gross and Reba McEntire round out the wacky cast in the battle against the ""Graboids,"" giant blind worms which track prey through vibrations.The plot is strictly that of a B-movie thriller, but the director, Ron Underwood, keeps it light with just the right amount of humor to make this an entertaining romp. I won't spoil the conclusion, but I will say that pole vaulting and pogo sticking skills are highly prized before the film is over. (You should be aware that there are multiple sequels, so how good of a solution to the Graboid infestation did the good citizens of Perfection, Nevada actually find?)This is a fun and quirky horror-comedy, which is a cinematic combination that is frequently attempted though rarely mastered as well (and with as low of a budget) as in ""Tremors.""",N/A

1043123,"The long wait has finally paid off, but I have to say I was a little disappointed with the packaging in this second and final season.  Instead of the nice fold-out pack from the first season, Paramount went with slim CD boxes (6 CDs) this time around stuck into a slip cover. At least they aren't double-sided discs. I guess this means a deluxe set, combining the two seasons, will be issued sometime in the near future, so you may want to wait and see.For such a short-lived series, Twin Peaks is arguably one of the most influential shows in television history, reshaping the medium by turning it in on itself.  Lynch used the death of Laura Palmer as a portal into the grainy world of small town America.  It was a continuation of the theme he set in Blue Velvet, and not surprisingly Kyle MacLachlan serves as his agent in uncovering the hidden nature of the notorious Twin Peaks.  However, while Lynch wanted to leave the murder hanging in the air, ABC wanted to resolve it, and apparently so did Mark Frost, and the suspense that carried the show was lost, never to be recovered.While the first season was tightly wrought, with all 7 episodes building seamlessly on the pilot episode, season two is a mixed bag.  The characters multiply and the story line seems to grow ever more convoluted, which I guess is why ABC wanted to see something wrapped up before the show got completely out of control.  Yet, the eeriness remained as TP came to personify that dark part of small town consciousness that lurks in almost every community.You either loved the show or hated it.  There were few persons who were indifferent to it, which is a pretty good indicator of the impact Twin Peaks had on television.  It would influence so many dramas and even comedies that followed, and spawn a whole range of stepchildren on HBO like Carnivale and Deadwood, where directors and writers could more freely explore their dark themes.  It is pretty amazing that Lynch and Frost were able to get away with what they did on Twin Peaks, showing just how effective a tool suspense could be if handled with a deft touch.",N/A

919729,"Kickbox Strikezone includes several segments (these are my names for them, not necessarily what you'll see on the DVD's menu):1.  Kickbox Warm-up (mild kickboxing moves are used to warm up the body and start bringing up the heart rate).2.  Kickbox Cardio (kicks and punches along with boxer shuffle, bob & weave, jumping jacks and such get you sweating and keep the heart rate up).3.  Kickbox Technique (technical instruction on kicking and punching using a paddle and a partner but, if you don't have either, you can follow the 2 solo women and do fine).4.  Kickbox Toning (using kickbox-type moves to tone the legs, hips and buns and work on balance--lots of balancing on one leg while you work muscles of the leg/hip/buns).5.  Kickbox Cool-down (t'ai chi cool-down with breathing and stretching).Pros:1.  Janis really seems to know her stuff when it comes to kickboxing and she has a great amount of passion for it.2.  The toning section is very effective--it's one of those workouts that you feel WHILE you're doing it as well as the next day.  Great buns work.3.  If you find Tae-bo too intense, this is a good kickboxing workout, and you will sweat, but it's not as intense as Tae-bo.  For me, that's a good thing--I like Tae-bo now and then, but find it too intense for a regular gig.4.  I was turned off by the paddle section the first time I did this, because it SEEMED to require equipment and a partner, neither of which I had.  However, on subsequent viewing, I realized that she has two women doing the technical workout without either a paddle OR a partner and I actually didn't feel like I was missing anything by following them vs. the pairs.  I really appreciated that she provided this alternative.Cons:1.  Until you get to the technique (3rd) section, there isn't much/any clear instruction on how to move your body while you're punching (i.e., that punching isn't just about your arms, but involves your whole body).  If you're a beginner, I'd suggest starting with at least a review of the paddle (technique) section before doing the workout.2.  Janis has a good-sized crew of people working out with her, but they're all so jammed together that you never really get to see anyone but the first few people in the front.  Especially for a kickboxing workout, this seemed like REALLY bad planning.  One tall guy toward the back couldn't even extend his kicks because he was too close to the woman in front of him.  Maybe that's the only space Janis could afford, but I would have rather seen less people doing the workout and have them spread out so they could really do (and show) their stuff.3.  This is just a personal preference thing for me--I love punching and don't care for kicking quite as much.  I would have loved this workout to be a bit less focused on kicking, though I understand that it's a lot easier to keep the heart rate up with kicking than it is with punching.  There are times when the kicking goes on too long (again, for my taste).4.  I wish the cardio section was longer.5.  I've edited my review to add this, which only came to light when I didn't do the whole workout for the first time recently.  The cooldown is the only segment of the DVD that isn't available to be chosen from the menu--this is really annoying to people who may not have time to do the whole workout.  You can't even use the ""next segment"" button on your DVD remote to get to it.  You have to go to the last segment before cooldown and fast forward to it, which is a waste of time (when you're limited on time in the first place).

920390,"A mostly phenomenal multiethnic cast is squandered in Paul Haggis' hysterically overheated and laughably - and ultimately depressingly - one-dimensional take on race relations (and barely anything else) in modern-day Los Angeles. I absolutely agree with David Edelstein's 'Slate' review: ""Haggis wants to distill all the resentment and hypocrisy among races into a fierce parable. But the old-fashioned carpentry (evocative of '30s socially conscious melodrama) makes this portrait of How We Live Now seem preposterous at every turn. A universe in which we're all racist puppets is finally just as simpleminded and predictable as one in which we're all smiling multicolored zombies in a rainbow coalition.""Right after I watched `Crash', my first impression was: What if the Mayor of Los Angeles set up a meeting with some movie studio heads and said, ""You know something, this city is getting just too crazy & overpopulated, and we really need to do something about it.  How about making an `anti-infomercial' for our town that depicts this place as unsavory, freakishly hostile, and all-around reprehensible & uninhabitable as possible?""If you don't happen to think this movie is shallow, I'd just like to point out what a perfect match it would make in a flashy DVD 2-pak right alongside 'Falling Down,' with Michael Douglas taking his ludicrous Alienated-White-Man `agenda' out on the big, bad & oh so unjust metropolis!  Seriously - `Crash' is that ridiculous movie's unofficial sequel, only with a fractured, quasi-Altmanesque story structure that is teeth-gnashingly contrived in its hokey setups and payoffs.  This is melodrama of such spectacular grandiosity and pomposity that it must make executive producers of daytime soap operas scarlet-faced and shuddering with envy.Still, I will wager anyone who's interested that 'Crash' is going to be the big upset at this year's Oscars & win Best Picture instead of `Brokeback Mountain' - it's just melodramatic & `controversial' and `tough-minded' and `hard-hitting' enough to be considered `serious movie-making'...when very unfortunately it is only what PASSES for serious movie-making these days.And while we're on the subject - what in the world is up with Tony Danza's cameo as the mega-racist Second Coming Of Satan!?

909503,"I enjoy romantic comedies a lot, and rented this with high hopes.  Debra Messing hires Dermot Mulroney from an escort service as her date to her sister's wedding, and to show off how well off she is to her cynical family.  Predictably, the business relationship becomes more romantic, and the two fall in love.The premise could have worked, if it weren't for a few glaring problems.  One, you don't really feel you know the main characters at all; they are just cliched romantic comedy prototypes, meaning you never really know why the two leads fall for each other.  Two, him being an escort doesn't really add anything to the plot, even though the movie thinks it does.  Three, none of the characters come across very likeable.  Four, Debra Messing and Dermot Mulroney have no chemistry at all.  You don't really care if the two get together, or even want them to, since they are rather cold to each other for most of the movie.If only one problem could be fixed, I'd choose the chemistry factor.  That could easily be fixed by replacing one of the actors.  Maybe Julia Roberts for Debra Messing, since it's fairly obvious this movie was probably proposed as a vehicle for her, or anyone else to be the Dermot Mulroney character, since he's really given nothing to do but be goodlooking.  No good romance exists without the chemistry.However, if you are looking for a simple diversion to kill 90 minutes, this movie could be okay.

677235,"This is the scariest movie I've ever seen - more terrifying even than ""Psycho."" It deserves to be better known.The only element that detracts from the impact of this film is the characters' gratuitous unpleasantness towards each other. ""Black Christmas"" is ahead of its time in substituting japing for real dramatic interaction. The sorority housemother is especially over-the-top offensive. When a father comes looking for his mysteriously missing daughter who hasn't come home for Christmas break - this housemother is so sloppily rude to him - you can't help but wish whatever menace is lurking around the place will take her out next.But the actors all do the best with the limited range scripted for their characters. Olivia Hussey provides something of a more sympathetic, leavening influence in this wasp's nest. Margot Kidder is perfect as the flip coed who injects a note of humor when she takes advantage of a police officer's limited sexual vocabulary. Keir Dullea poses a convincing threat as a moody, angry music student at the university.But whatever the movie may lack in character development, it more than makes up for with sheer suspense.

447364,"From the opening to the closing credits, filled with illustrations that originally accompanied Doyle's stories in the Strand, the details of the movie are painstakingly accurate when compared to those in the canon.  This is one non-canonical Holmes story that exists in the same world as Sir Arthur Conan Doyle's Sherlock Holmes.The movie takes the liberty of assuming that all of Dr. Watson's accounts of Sherlock Holmes are true, except for one.  That would be ""The Final Problem"", in which the great detective supposedly dies at the hands of his arch-enemy Professor Moriarty.  The movie suggests that this story is merely a cover up for a period in time in which Holmes was getting help with his cocaine addiction from none other than famous psychiatrist Sigmund Freud.The settings and characters ring true to both Doyle's mysteries and the Sydney Paget illustrations that accompanied them.  Sherlock Holmes' deerstalker and cloak, though never mentioned by Doyle, look more like Paget's illustrations than ever before, more rugged than in most film interpretations.  American actor Robet Duvall, despite sometimes struggling with the British accent, portrays Watson as an intellectually and physically fit comrade for Holmes, not a bumbler.  Laurence Olivier's Prof. Moriarty matches the vision of Doyle and Paget rather than the clich&eacute; mustache twirler of other movies.  Only now, Moriarty isn't really a criminal mastermind.  He's Holmes' childhood math tutor.Alan Arkin depicts Freud as a man of intelligence, insight, and above all, honor.The inclusion of lesser known characters like Mycroft Holmes and Toby is a plus.  There are also references, both direct and sly, to canonical Holmes stories.While Nicol Williamson's performance as Sherlock Holmes lacks the vigor and spark of Basil Rathbone or Christopher Plummer, Williamson succeeds in showing Holmes as a troubled individual rather than a god.  The movie mixes drama, subtle humor, mystery, and even action, finally showing Holmes as the capable fighter he was in the canon.  The end of the film strays from the books in order to explore the uncharted territory of Holmes' childhood, providing a deeply moving climax.This may come truer to Sir Arthur's original vision than any other pastiche written for film so far.",The Seven-Per-Cent Solution
406568,"I've always liked this film.  The plot is extremely simple.  A black stud gets taken downtown, but they pick up a black activist along the way.  Sweetback beats the crap out of the cops, then runs to Mexico.  This film is remarkable in that it has a feel of a French New Wave film.  Van Peebles had lived in Paris in the 1960's, and the influence of that country's films rubbed off of him here (which is a good thing).  With jump cuts, double exposures, and various other visual tricks, Van Peebles made the most artistic blaxploitation film ever made.  The fact that it doesn't seem concerned with plot either (many European films don't have as much plotting as American ones do) gives it an even more European feel to it.  But the situation is strictly American.  I love the soundtrack too.  Van Peebles wrote the music, but it's performed by Earth, Wind, and Fire.  I do feel that the slogan ""rated X by an all white jury"" is a bit silly.  As another reviewer pointed out, Kubrick's A Clockwork Orange, Peckinpah's Straw Dogs, and Scheslinger's Midnight Cowboy all got tagged with an X rating around this time, so it was a tad ridiculous.  No doubt the tag line helped sell a lot more tickets.  I admit I smiled when I saw that on the cover of the film, but then realised that it's really just a gimmick.  Regardless, this is a very good film, provocative, visually exciting, and memorable.",Sweet Sweetback's Baadasssss Song VHS
232703,"Let's face, very few scenes in any movie are more fun that watching the German panzer commander try (and fail) to overcome rolling tins of gasoline the tune of ""Horst Wessel""  The symbolism is so accurate, and so silly, that it almost makes one giddy.  Fonda and Bronson are both excellent as the play, with straight faces, an American colonel in Intelligence (Fonda) and a roughneck American Lieutenant (Bronson)-- ""Heyyy, wait a minute"" says Bronson, snapping his fingers in the film's second most memorable moment -- Telly Savalas, however, steals the show as ""Joe"" a black marketing tank commander.So, it's stupid, but the movie is FUN as it presents the Reader's Digest, Americanized version of a bloodless Battle -- that repeats every fabled anecdote of the battle, and boils them down to polished chestnuts.  To be fair, this movie was really intended (like How the West was Won) to showcase the new ""Cinerama"" dome and its big curved screen -- Imax before Imax.

The man is a saint and that's what I have loved about him since when I first watched the cartoons back in the 70's.  I noticed he was one of the few characters that didn't have a large flaw or a kind of a devlish side to him.

925607,"I am a student of history and have read extensively in this period so I was looking forward to this film.  Unfortunately this is a terribly flawed film and this begins with Orlando Bloom who is terribly miscast. Dirt and grit does not make you either masculine or heroic.  Bloom is alleged to be a ""blacksmith"" but he is probably about 50 pounds too light to be convincing in that role.  We are expected to believe that in a matter of hours / days he becomes a skilled warrior capable of ending off some well armed and mounted men-at-arms.  Mastering the broadsword requires a great deal more practice.The villains in the film are based on actual characters and come across pretty much like I think they were.  The Muslims are portrayed in a rather sympathetic light which isn't too far from the historical record.  I thought the film was relatively slow, Bloom was miscast, but the photography was good as were the costumes.  I thought the storyline was a little too politically correct and the ending was simply not believable.  A little more action might have helped.

703090,"Sometimes hokey, sometimes eerily effective, this adaptation of H. P. Lovecraft's ""The Shadow Over Innsmouth"" is directed by Stuart Gordon, who did the popular ""Re-Animator"" films.If you're looking for a truly faithful adaptation of Lovecraft's work, you won't find it here.  For that, you should check out Lurker Films' ""The Call of Cthulhu"" and the three volumes of the H. P. Lovecraft Film Festival available on DVD (all can be ordered from Amazon).""Dagon"", like most commercial Lovecraft-based films, mixes a the basic story concepts of ""Shadow"" --- with a nod to the story of the title, ""Dagon"", and it's a reasonably entertaining film.My major objection is that there are one or two scenes of truly stomach-turning gore that not only go way beyond what's needed to tell a story, but are at odds with the mood and atmosphere Gordon has established in the film.  Just as Lovecraft himself sometimes attempted to bury his readers in a torrent of adjectives and adverbs in an attempt to create overwhelming horror, Gordon goes way over the top and succeeds only in disgusting the audience rather than horrifying it.  Of course, if extreme gore is your thing, you won't object to these sequences, but to me it's just disgusting.On the plus side, the eerie village is beautifully designed (with fairly good CGI), the story clips along at a good pace, and the ending is satisfying.  Certainly not a great piece of cinema, but Lovecraft fans should check it out.  Just be prepared for one really repulsive scene.  (I fast-forwarded through it.)",Dagon

A big, bad corporation bought out the owners of the radio station and was going to turn the theater into a parking lot.

337061,"""Only Two Can Play"" is an underrated and overlooked slice of early Peter Sellers, before success in America thinned his body and inflated his comic style. Its plot is simple enough: Sellers is a theater critic and librarian with a wife (Virginia Maskell) and two kids, but this doesn't keep his eye from wandering, especially to a married but still entirely willing socialite (Mai Zetterling). From this straightforward triangular premise, the film works into the kind of subtle and intelligent sex comedy that England was so proficient at producing in the 50's and 60's. The comic effect is aided in no small part by Richard Attenborough's priceless portrayal of a foppish, pretentious poet (pardon the alliteration). Pick up a copy if you can track one down.

It sports a magnificentl transfer! This is a good visual film to start with, particularly when it shows the inside of this incredible mansion where a lot of the scenes take place, and now it's given its full justice with this great-looking DVD.To those who have never seen it, you are warned that it is not an easy film to view, it being a portrait of a pathetic has-been silent movie star who still thinks she can come back after a long hiatus and be a star again.Gloria Swanson, who plays the role, overacts and certainly is not appealing, even bordering on grotesque at times, but she isn't supposed to look good. That's one of the points of the story. Anyway, a young William Holden, in his first starring role, is okay and also provides the narration.The most interesting figure in the film to me was the ex-husband-now butler, played by Eric von Stroheim.

98175,"The summer of 1989 was loaded with blockbusters, yet there was only one movie that I really wanted to see more than any other. In a season that saw such blockbusters as a new Indiana Jones movie, the latest Star Trek picture and Timothy Dalton's second outing as 007, the movie that held the most excitement for me was LETHAL WEAPON 2. Not because of Mel Gibson or Danny Glover or a particular love of the original, but because the love interest came in the very lovely shape of the lead singer of one of my favorite 1980s bands (Eighth Wonder) Patsy Kensit.Truth be told though, there's not much to Kensit's role here, she is there simply as window dressing in the part of a secretary at the South African consulate. The movie as a whole though is a great, fun ride and is easily my favorite of the franchise.The plot of the movie involves drug smuggling that is being conducted by officials at the South African consulate. Back in the 1980s South Africa was largely an international pariah because of its policy of apartheid. This made it easy to target them as the villains and their position as diplomats provides them with the protective vbeil of diplomatic immunity. As lead villain Arjen Rudd (played wonderfully by British actor Joss Ackland) comments when confronting the Los Angeles police officers ""you could not even give me a parking ticket.""Starting with a chase through the night streets of Los Angeles, the movie races from one action sequence to another rarely pausing for breath in what is a classic cop buddy movie. Both Gibson and Glover make a great team and the interplay between them provides for some really subtle humor.Which brings us to Joe Pesci, whose humor is about as subtle as a sledgehammer in the role of witness Leo Getz - ""Whatever you want Leo Getz - get it!?"" Pesci is at times annoying and at other times loveable, but he is always funny. Obviously he was also a hit with the audience too as he would return in the third and fourth movie of the series.As a bonus for Kensit fans like myself - in the scene where Leo is cleaning Riggs house you can hear Eighth Wonder's biggest hit ""I'm not Scared"" playing in the background. It's a shame they did not have Kensit's character survive until the end as they had originally planned, but I understand that her death leads Riggs to take the dramatic action that he does.This is my favorite cop movie (alongside ""Beverly Hills Cop"" and an entertaining way to spend 114 minutes or 118 minutes if you go with the directors cut.Scenes included in the directors cut includes Leo using numbers to remember a suspects address and Murtaugh getting some bad news from an auto-repair man after Riggs drives his new station wagon up against a guardrail. Pretty standard stuff that I felt did not add anything particularly.The directors cut also comes with a making of featurette, cast and crew bios and a theatrical trailer. Here's hoping that one day soon Warner will put out an ultimate edition. Director Richard Donner has already done a great commentary track on the original Suoerman movie and a commentary track here would be welcome also.Recommended.",N/A

Murrow stands in stark relief as the only brave man willing to stand up to McCarthy, juxtaposed with a couple and a fellow journalist who stand in for ""ordinary people"" (fearful, unable to cope with the pressure).If you are looking for a civics lesson and a morality tale of the bravery of the lone hero, you'll like this movie. If you are looking for emotional intensity or being lost in a story, you will not find it here.This movie is contemptuous of television for having failed its potential as a source of information and education for the American people - more like a newspaper.

She considers herself stupid, sneaks Science magazines to read when her overbearing husband isn't around, and finally gathers the courage (while staring at the stars one night) to change her plight.  She takes a computer course, passes her GED and with the constant support of her dearest girlfriend gathers the courage to get out of the stifling marriage with her husband and study to improve her lot in life.  Along the way she discovers other secrets about herself, buried in the facade of a life she has led.  She changes, relates to the world in a different way, and refuses to settle for returning to 'the old life' when her husband returns promising her change.  Her relationship with her girlfriend proceeds to intimate levels, but in the end this friendship cannot last, as her girlfriend doesn't have the same goals.The story is simple, but in the hands of the writers Wendy Hammond and Bob Gosse and with Gosse's fine direction, the entire cast gives us an ensemble of disparate characters in whom we can all believe.  Lili Taylor plays the lead with extraordinary skill and as her girlfriend Courtney Love gives a bravura performance.  The remainder of the cast (Spalding Gray, Noah Emmerich, Gideon Jacobs, Mischa Barton, et al) is likewise strong.

1028004,"I wanted to love M. Night Shyamalan's film, Lady in the Water. Moving in a different direction from his trademark style as evidenced by films like The Sixth Sense, Unbreakable and The Village, Shyamalan delivers a fairytale about an apartment superintendent who rescues a young woman in the complex's swimming pool. With the help of some of the other tenants, he must uncover information about her and her world in order to help her return home. While based on his book of the same name, the movie is wholly original introducing a world of characters not in the book.Paul Giamatti, who does a wonderful job as the superintendent who is more than he seems, leads the cast. Tragedy has led his character to distance himself from others, observing the tenants of his world without involvement. Discovering the young woman, revealed to be a character from a fairytale called a Narf, reasserts his confidence and starts a process of reconnection to others beginning with the tenants he recruits to help him with his charge.Bryce Dallas Howard plays the titular role of the Lady in the Water. She does a good job with the role but is given very little to do and even less dialogue. I left the film feeling I knew as little about her and her world as I came in with. However, the film isn't so much about her as it is about her effect on the people championed to help her with her journey home.It's a unique and interesting cast of characters who inhabit the world of the apartment complex. There is a critic who foreshadows events by his knowledge of movies, a man obsessed with crossword puzzles, a Korean woman and her granddaughter who know the legend of the young woman's world, a man who is conducting an experiment of building up his musculature on only one side of his body among others. Somewhat distracting is M. Night Shyamalan narcissistically casting himself as a writer whose work is so profound it will change the world.Because the characters and their actions were written so broadly and stereotypically, it was often difficult to tell if these were supposed to be real people mystically brought together to mirror the fairytale or if they were part of the fairytale being told. Always quirky, the characters interactions are frequently funny while the creatures trying to prevent the young woman from returning home are often frightening. The computer-generated presentation of the creatures is interesting and adds to the atmosphere because they are never clearly seen. They are seen mostly through darkness and in shadows with lights, sound and description used for enhanced effect.While I enjoyed the movie, I left feeling something was missing and wanting more. The ending felt abrupt and incomplete, adding to the confusion. If these were supposed to be real people drawn together to help a young woman only known because of a fairytale, the potential for growth existed for all of the tenants in this journey but the film stops short of showing how any of them are changed for their experience. The film is worth seeing for the direction, cinematography, characters and concept, unfortunately the storytelling itself is less than clear.",N/A

928853,"Final Fantasy VII: Advent Children is the first in wave of brand new Final Fantasy VII related sequels called The Compilation of Final Fantasy VII Project. I say its Square-Enix's attempt at milking the cash-cow that is their first blockbuster game until its poor utter bleeds. This movie is pure fan gratification for the people that remain in love with game even though it is quickly approaching its tenth year anniversary. Granted, its not even good fan gratification.I'll preface why I think Advent Children is a poor tribute to hard-core fans, casual fans, and newcomers alike, by stating my game credentials. Final Fantasy VII annoyed me. It was a good game. I liked it when it came out, but I place it in the middle-lower end of series' quality spectrum. The part that annoys me is that for the last ten years, I've had to listen to the Final Fantasy VII fanboys, most of which have never really played an RPG before or after this one, blow the game completely out of proportion. Now, thanks to this movie, I'm sure this will continue for ten more years since this brainless, empty little affair is getting such high praise.Final Fantasy newcomers, avoid this movie, because what little of the plot makes sense only makes sense if you have played the game. The DVD has a retrospective from the game that is meant to help you out, but it is about twenty-minutes of still screen-shots from the game and it doesn't really cover much other than a few key scenes. It's pretty to look at, but it isn't pretty enough to find yourself awash in two hours worth of dreck.Now onto why Advent Children is a poor tribute for all the fans, casual and hard-core alike. For years, those fans have been begging Square-Enix to remake the game with state-of-the-art technology because the blocky 3D graphics of the early playstation days are really looking ugly. That is about the only thing Advent Children does: it looks pretty. Character models are gorgeous and as close to photorealistic as I've ever seen. When the camera isn't zipping around during fight scenes and people aren't doing ridiculous acrobatic combat, its easy to forget that everything you see is all computer generated. When it shifts into its numerous fight scenes, the audience is treated to frantic and cool-looking battles, at least in the first quarter of the movie. As the film approaches its climax, the combat becomes more and more ridiculous. People jump higher than superman. Two men engage in a fifteen minute sword fight while airborne the entire time. A motorcycle chase doesn't even try to adhere to the laws of physics. It becomes too much. Which brings me to my first point. The overall style of this movie is more suited to a game like Devil May Cry than any of the Final Fantasy series. I'll honestly say that if combat in the movie resembled the way it looks in the game, it would have been lame, but then again I ever imagined Cloud Strife as having the same moves as Neo from the Matrix.Point number Two is: The plot is a mess and the characterization is poor. This thing is so amateurishly written its sad, considering the plot/character progression is what so many people adored about the game. First, you must forget that misanthropic ending that implied that saving the world caused the extinction of the humans. In Advent Children, everyone is alive, but not so well. A strange sickness is spreading throughout the population called Geo-Stigma. Three white-haired men show up looking for the head of Jenova. It's up the heroes of Final Fantasy VII to stop their evil plot, but main character Cloud Strife is too busy being a sad little emo-kid who feels useless and refuses to fight. Cloud spends most of the movie moping about over issues I thought he had already resolved in the game, which gives the other characters time to make cameo appearances. Everyone outside of Cloud feels extraneous in this movie. Being that it is so Cloud-centric, its Surprising that Cloud doesn't have the best scenes. The most amusing and enjoyable scenes belong to the characters affiliated with the Shinra Corporation and they weren't even playable characters in the game. Everything culminates to a climax in which the dead villain Sephiroth comes back from the dead for one last duel with Cloud. I wonder what preteen fan fiction writer Square Enix found to write this plot, because that is exactly what it amounts to.To be honest, I don't know what I was expecting from this movie. I think I was at least hoping not to dislike it, but that's exactly what happened. The idea of watching this a second time is almost unbearable. If this is a taste of future videogames from Square will look like, we are lucky in did, but we all need to hope that Square keeps their future endeavors in the realm of videogames.It's not easy to create something that retains such a strong following a decade after its release. Final Fantasy VII fans deserved better after a decade of support",N/A

524055,"This may be the worst movie I have sat all the way through.I kept thinking (or hoping) not that it would get better but that it would get less bad.It didn't.  It just went from bad to worse.This is chiefly because of bad writing throughout, lame special effects, and bad--spectacularly bad--acting on the part of the two principal white males.Cole Hauser, who plays Vin Diesel's Probation Officer, learned acting in modeling school: to act, strike poses.  He overacts, or I should say overposes, shamelessly.Vin Diesel has the opposite technique.  He apparently filmed this while in a coma.  Either that or he phoned it in, and his body was produced by special effects.The women aren't bad, but nothing can redeem this hopeless clunker.Even the creatures aren't very frightening.  And the more you see them, the less frightening they get.  All of $1.75 was spent on their computer animation.And at least that much was spent on red-syrup for blood.  There is also a lot of blue-syrup for blood.  This is either the creatures' blood, or simply some arty filming.Also in the Arty Filming Dept. is the overall YELLOW of the first scenes.  Later this is dropped, with no explanation.  Also dropped is the notion that the survivors have to use breathing apparatus.  I guess they got tired of sucking on tubes.  These simply disappear.They aren't the only ones that suck.  Marvelously sucky are the stabs at Portentous Dialogue.  Seeing Vin Diesel debate (or somnabulate) theology with the Muslim guy is truly amusing.  (But don't eat your lunch first.)What redeems this whole mess is the fact that YOU DON'T CARE A DAMN ABOUT THE CHARACTERS. When they die, or when they escape, you don't care.A silly comedy.

It's about family and about discovering the individuality within that family while keeping both intact.The film centers on a rather tumultuous relationship between sisters Maggie (Cameron Diaz) and Rose (Toni Collette). Each sister is a complete opposite of the other yet bound by ties that run far deeper than surface appearances. Rose is the mousey responsible sister who tries to rescue Maggie, the flakey beautiful one, from self-destruction. As with all relationships complications arise, feelings get hurt and an inevitable split occurs. Into the picture arrives a long lost grandmother, Ella (Shirley MacLaine) and everything is up for grabs. But it's the way the storytellers reveal each character's nuances that make this movie so special. It covers the ages with insecurities and doubts but heals the wounds with subtle intention.Cameron Diaz is truly wonderful in her role as Maggie and she brings to the role a depth she has rarely been able to delve into in her prior films. Toni Collette steals the show with her tremendous acting ability and Shirley MacLaine is given the chance to be the films stabilizing force.

986943,"Fresh off his visceral masterpiece Haute tension, French director Alexandre Aja gets behind the camera once more for his second film, a revamping of Wes Craven's 1977 Texas Chainsaw wanna-be The Hills Have Eyes.Upon a casual glance, it's easy to dismiss Hills as yet another useless Hollywood remake of a gritty `70s horror film - the original is indeed gritty and from the `70s. However, unlike Dawn of the Dead or The Texas Chainsaw Massacre, Hills is a film that could actually benefit from an updating. Also, unlike the Dawn and Chainsaw remakes, Hills has a director at the helm that actually loves the genre and knows what the hell he's doing.By now, the scenario is all too familiar: an all-American family gets lost in the middle of nowhere and falls prey to some twisted clan of deranged psychopaths. Clich&eacute;d? Sure, but don't forget that the original Hills was one of the first. So just what does Aja bring to the table that sets Hills apart from the other (usually laughable) films of this type? An abundance of style, realism, emotion, and gore.Aja seems to have a very solid understanding of the most primal emotions possessed by mankind, and in Hills, he explores them in a way that most filmmakers wouldn't dare. As in Haute tension, the violence is presented in a delicate blend of realistic horror and exploitative titillation. When the family is first attacked, the violence is brutal and ugly. However, when the tables are turned a member of the family becomes the one inflicting the violence, the bloodletting is slightly heightened and exploited for entertainment. Could the protagonist be enjoying his vicious revenge? Aja portrays this masterfully and dares his audience to enjoy it with the protagonist. Just how far should one be willing to go? How far is too far? Is this just as wrong? Can it be justified?Something else atypical about Hills is that we actually care about the characters. Instead of the usual ditzy blonde teens we can't wait to see get killed off, these characters are believable and we feel for them. They are all wonderfully portrayed by the fine cast, especially Aaron Stanford (whom you may recognize from X-Men 2 and 3), who gives a surprisingly terrific performance.Something else that makes Hills more than just an average slasher flick is the masterfully subtle social commentary. The ever-present motif of the American flag (quite literally being shoved down a throat at one point)...the rousing score so peculiarly similar to Ennio Morricone's distinctly (and ironically) American The Good, The Bad and The Ugly...the ubiquitous desiccated desert landscape that bears a suspicious resemblance to the Middle East...this film has something to say.The only real flaw I can find in Hills is that there are, occasionally, a few groan-inducing ""jump scares"". They're cheap, gimmicky, and wholly unnecessary. But considering that Haute tension is pretty much entirely without such trickery, I can only guess (and hope) that they were due to studio interference. They have to at least somewhat cater to that moronic demographic, I suppose.So what's next for Aja? He says his next film, The Waiting, is going to be a gore-less ghost story. He says he wants to see if he can be scary without the gore. There you have it, folks - a man that is unafraid to unflinchingly show copious bloodshed, knows how to present subtle social commentary, and is looking to challenge himself. If the horror genre has a savior, Alexandre Aja is it.",The Hills Have Eyes
569566,"This film version of Verdi's Othello -- directed and conducted by Herbert Von Karajan, a man of many talents -- is excellent in many respects, and more than adequate in most. The occasional variation in decibel level is perhaps the only flaw. Buckets of water (intended to serve as the spray of breakers) aside, the 'special affects' are pretty good. The film is nicely filmed; there were times I was convinced they'd found some Maltese castle, but apparently it was done in a Berlin studio. The camera moves subtly and slowly, with none of the frenetic movement (let alone car chases, etc.) that would probably characterize a film version today.Desdemona would ideally be played by a younger woman than Mirella Freni, but her voice is fine, and her acting gives us a convincing Desdemona (loving and innocent). Peter Glossop is a very good, and sufficiently scary, Jago. He conveys well the moral elusiveness of the part, as well as the earnestness that compels Otello to trust him. Jon Vickers' gravity-defying hair is reminiscent of 1970s televangelists, but his voice is superb and his acting is good. He has a phenomenal presence; the nonchalance of Otello, which is importantly suggestive of his inner strength and confidence, is conveyed ever so well. That said (according to the accompanying description of the performance), Vickers deliberately stammers a line early on in the love duet to foreshadow an element of anxiety/fear. But overall to see him next to Jago is to see a lion next to a jackal. And yet the smooth 'jackal' wins, and the powerful, passionate 'lion' loses.... It is quite moving.The Times (of London) described this as 'one of the best filmed operas ever made'. Perhaps this was true when it was first made (1974). Still, it has stood the test of time.",N/A

109138,"This is either a movie that you love and laugh your a** off during, or you think it is one of the worse films ever made--not worth seeing once, let alone repeated viewings. Well, I've seen it many times and just love it, as it never fails to make me laugh. I also see all kinds of rather profound and deep stuff hidden in this quirky story. There are lots of interesting details that probably go over the head of the majority of viewers. Oh well. 'BRAIN CLOUD'! It's like the movie exists in it's own particular space of understanding, and you have to be within that same sphere to 'get it'. Apparently, not many people are, as it appears this movie was a big flop at the box office and was universally panned by the critics. In my opinion, that alone makes it worth going out of your way to see!One of my favorite scenes is in the openning scenes with Mr. Waturi. ""I know he can get the job, but can he DO the job?"" Haven't we all had a moronic boss like that, repeating himself ad nauseum, talking incessantly on the phone to make himself feel important? He's absolutely perfect in that role. ""I'm not arguing that with you!!!"", he screams repeatedly. He's actually an archetype of a very real phenomena in the everyday workplace. There really are people just like him out there! In fact, most all the characters in this movie are unabashed character exagerrations. The humor in it is such that it is the kind you either 'get' or you don't 'get'. One time, at a family gathering I brought a video of the movie over, excited to share it with all of them after dinner. Well, before it got 30 minutes into the film, one by one they all excused themselves from the room! Nobody else laughed! Not even once! (Except for me of course, who was rolling on the floor). Go figure!The film has has a great cast: Meg Ryan plays (very convincingly) the parts of the three main female roles wonderfully. Tom Hanks plays his usual lovable self as 'Joe Banks' who has a pragmatic death wish. Lloyd Bridges plays the billionaire Greyamore, with his duck headed walking stick as he smashes it into walls. Just beautiful! Mr. Waturi is an absolute piece of work, and that demented luggage salesman, whoever he is, is a classic among all movie characters!  The look in this guy's beady, slightly cross-eyed face as he say's, ""Ah, a real.... Journey!"" (hands rubbing in anticipation of the outrageous commission) is worth the price of admission alone.Quirky details: 'Jump' orange soda! Gotta love it! ""I've forgotten how 'BIG'!"" Throughout the movie, there are repeated symbols popping up. Like the logo of the disgusting 'Acme' company Joe works for. (""50 years of petrolium jelly""). The movie opens with Joe and his coworkers trudging along this crooked walkway (to the tune of Tennessee Ernie Ford's 'I owe my soul to the company store') shaped in the symbol of a lightening bolt which we later notice is the company logo. Of course, this ill-conceived pathway makes the workers walk about 5 times more distance than would otherwise be necessary if it were an efficient design, but that's the corporate world for you! Interestingly, we see this same symbol repeated in other scenes and contexts throughout the film, like the march up the volcano with tourches at night. Clever! Not only is movie funny, but there are lots of layers to it.  It's revealing of human nature, of the dichotomy of the 'artificial' and the 'real' and also has moments that are quite serious and touching in the depth of the underlying message. One such moment is at one point when Joe is close to death after the shipwreck on the ocean, in his weakness he is awakened to a spiritual realization of the preciousness and enormity of life. There is alot of very profound meaning that underscores the quirky comedy in this film. Therein lies it's real brilliance.This really is an 'odd duck' of a movie, as it doesn't really know if it's a satire, a comedy, an offbeat drama, or what. But that's precisely why I think it's great and why it works. Highly recommended for repeat viewings.",N/A
877253,"Poorly done - mostly fiction with no fact!  Good for entertainment but not for science.  I was totally disappointed and believe now that the intent of the DVD was to do a hatchet job on the bible - and done poorly.  The DVD starts out like it is going to trace the biblical Exodus to Egypt's Pharaohs and tell what really happened to the Pharaoh's first-born son - was he killed by God's wrath or by man's wrath.  The DVD reminded me of a Laurel and Hardy movie - sending Egyptologist Weeks and journelist Sennet around Egypt in a comedy fashion. It starts out with finding a skull, believed to be Rameses' son and half-way through the DVD they find out that this skull is not the skull they were looking for and so they tossed it and took another skull from the tomb (four total in one mass grave - which is kind of strange for Pharaoh's sons) and reconstructed this skull to look like what they think Rameses's first born looked like without any evidence that it is THE one.  Rameses is alleged to have over 100 children. Overall, the producers of this DVD didn't know where the Red Sea geograhical crossing took place, where the mountain of God was located or where the burning bush was located or at what date this all took place, or under which Pharaoh, etc - all of which I believe now to be wrong in their hypothesis.  Since their hypothesis didn't agree with the bible, it didn't dawn on the people putting this expose together that they might be looking in the wrong places, time, Pharaohs, etc; so ... they changed the bible text! Is this what schools are teaching for science today?  I recently ordered and reviewed the DVD Exodus Revealed and the book Exodus Case by Dr. Moller, both which are outstanding and CREDIBLE and based on science.  In these two items - they do reveal where the crossing took place and where the Mountain of God (Mt. Sinai) is, as well as finding evidence of Pharaoh's chariots on the bottom of the Red Sea. I recommend these two as a must see if one is interested in the Exodus Red Sea crossing and would wait to see the Rameses DVD on Discovery, Nat'l Geographic and other PBS channel types.",Rameses - Wrath of God or Man?

In both movies you have to agree to suspend your disbelief about the plot, and just enjoy the power that each actor puts into his or her role.Here's the basic summary. Angels are not the Renaissance golden-haired glowy, friendly creatures that DaVinci conned us into believing in. Re-read your Bible. Angels were the holders of swords of flame. Angels were the ones out there slicing down the non-believers and killing by the thousands. They were a fierce army. Unknown to mankind, many angels were pretty grumpy when Jesus died on the cross and in essence elevated mankind over the angels. The angels felt betrayed, ignored by God. It's like when Mom came home with a new baby brother and suddenly the new baby was the one getting all the attention. The angels were the older sibling, about to throw a temper tantrum.Fast forward to modern times. You have an ex-priest-wannabe-turned-cop Thomas, played by Elias Koteas, who starts to get called in on some strange cases. Turns out the dead guy they find is a hermaphrodite, is carrying a 2nd century Bible and is branded with the mark of an angel. The trail leads to Simon, another angel, who is trying to help keep a ""really evil soul"" from Gabriel (Christopher Walken). Gabriel wants this evil soul to help him storm heaven, to make God pay for turning His back on all the angels. Simon gets his hands on the soul in question, but with Gabriel hot on his heels, he has to hide it somewhere. He puts it into a Native American girl's body.Soon we have a showdown betwee Thomas, Gabriel, the young girl, her tribe, and of course Lucifer, played by Viggo Mortensen. It comes down not to a fist battle, but to a theological argument - how Gabriel looks down on all of us ""monkey boys"" but is insanely jealous that God will not talk to him any more.So there are many plot problems here. With the war going on for 2,000 years, they are saying that the prophecy of the worst soul of all was some Korean War guy that just died?? Because he resorted to cannibalism?? Heck, I'm sure we can name many people who became cannibals in desperate times. They're pretty sure the Pilgrims did that when they were all freezing / starving to death. It's sad, but if you're about to die, you make some not-so-sane (or maybe sane depending on your point of view) decisions. Surely if they wanted the Ultimate Evil they could have gone for Hitler ... or one of his scientists ... or how about Pol Pot and slaying 2 million people? Some small time cannibal is the worst they could get?Then, we have Simon walking into a church to an open casket coffin and taking the soul. Do they really leave coffins open all night long in churches? When Simon took the soul, he really had NO plan at all of what he was going to do, knowing he was injured, and just randomly decided to stick it in this girl? The village had many 30 people in it total. Even if Gabriel had to slay everyone in the village to make sure he got to the soul, it didn't seem like much of a problem for Gabriel. He rather would enjoy that.However, like I said, plot isn't a big thing here. The characters are. Christopher Walken is EXCELLENT as Gabriel, once the shining boy of God, now cut off from the voice. He's eternally young, powerful, and good at manipulation. He believes completely in his right to power and is just so incredibly weary of stupid little monkey-people screwing things up. That all being said - he can't drive?? Surely sometime since cars were invented he could have learned.Elias is great as Thomas, the doubter who slowly regains his faith. Virginia Madsen (Sideways fame) does well as the schoolmarm who sticks up for Mary, the young girl. Mary really puts in a chilling performance as a once-innocent girl who becomes possessed with the soul of a calculating soldier.I really enjoyed Lucifer when he showed up at the end of the movie. He perches like a gargoyle, looking down at all of us squirming humans. But he doesn't come across as evil - oh no. Everything the Bible says is that Lucifer is handsome, seductive, oh so compelling. He tells us things we want to believe. In fact it's hard to resist him. In the movie, Viggo slides around the people he talks to, circling them like a snake, moving in close. He wants you to trust him ... he says he doesn't want another Hell, he wants to be the sole ruler. He's going to HELP the humans. If they just trust him.This isn't really a spoiler, since the movie is rather transparent from start to finish, but I was REALLY disappointed that Lucifer's aims were so straightforward. He is above all a deceiver. So what did the plot do? They put him in where he told the truth, people believed him, did what he said and it all worked out. It was a real let down! Viggo did such a great job with the smooth, ""beautiful"", ultimate power of Lucifer that I was waiting for his dialogue to all be a complex set-up to deceive the people. Instead, nope, he just walks away and turns into a cloud of blackbirds, much like many other movies on this topic.Still, again, the plot has holes. You just deal with it. There really is a lot of beauty in the storyTELLING - from the landscapes people go across, to the looks in the actors eyes in various scenes. It really is quite telling that some angels have no eyes when they are found - and that other scenes focus in on the eyes as the window to the soul. Since, after all, that is what the movie is all about.",Prophecy VHS
699684,"This is a great show honoring the great Carl Perkins.  I actually recorded this on VHS when it was aired on TV during the late '80's.Highlights for me, like the others who have reviewed it, are Ringo and George who are clearly having a blast singing and playing with one of their heroes.  Everyone's love and admiration for Carl P. is obvious and very moving.  Final note:  I agree with some others who have opined that this show captures the best playing Clapton has done in the past 25 years, or more.  I know it's heresy to say that he usually bores me.  Maybe he came to life here because of Carl's presence, or maybe I just like him a lot better playing rockabilly.

After seeing commercials for the Descent and hearing rave reviews, I decided to go and look up the first film from Marshall.  This is a fantastic surprise, and being a horror fan, I am really surprised I let this one slip by when it was first released.  The story is fairly straight forward with a squad of British soldiers being dropped off in the Scottish highlands for a training mission.  Along the way they find the slaughtered remains of the special ops team they were to compete against.  From there, it is non stop action to the end with werewolves against soldiers.  Even though this is a low budget film, it is very high quality and the acting is solid.  Though sometimes the British accents are a little thick and with unfamilar slang to American ears.  This is a great little film, and I am going right out to catch The Descent as soon as possible.",N/A

I borrowed it almost one/two year ago from Blockbuster (and now I own it on DVD). I saw King Arthur and felt in love with Clive Owen. So I wanted to watch more movies with him.This movie is absolutly amazing. It shows you the poorness in other countries. Next to it, there is a wonderful love story. But the love story is not overdone. It has the right touch for the movie.The acting is breathtaking. Clive Owen cries a few times in this movie - an actor who can crie (it is unusual). I completly felt in love with his character Nick - the second he appeared on screen. Also Angelina is amazing.It is sad that this movie did not get much attention in theater. I missed the movie in theater, because I did not knew of this movie.I would give Clive, Angelina and the movie an Oscar.I think it is a must see movie. Watch it. It is breathtaking.",Beyond Borders

187968,"This DVD is a magnificent review of the life and career of the incomparable jazz legend Ella Fitzgerald!  Essentially a bio flick spliced with spell-binding footage of Fitzgerald in concert at the peak of her prowess as the consummate song stylist, ""Something to Live For"" is a superb showcase of her octave-defying ability to elevate scat-singing to a fine art.  Except for Sarah Vaughan--Fitzgerald's only real rival--no one could touch Fitzgerald's smoothness, her uncanny musical ear and improvisationary skills. Blessed with perfect pitch--it was said that her backing musicians used her voice to tune their instruments--Fitzgerald set a near-unmatchable course, coursing through the swing and bebop eras through stripped-down post-modernist combos and retro.""Something to Live For"" charts her rise from Harlem beginnings to world-famous jazz diva.  Her musical development is juxtaposed with her often unhappy personal life, which included the early death of her mother (before Fitzgerald was a pre-teen), two failed marriages, her inability to have children, the eventual toll of near-constant touring, along with her willful ignorance of the diabetes which eventually killed her.  At times, you feel as if music was the only thing that kept her afloat--indeed something she truly lived for.  Narrated by the great Tony Bennett, this DVD features a considerable number of wry, funny and insightful interviews with peers, friends and fellow artist admirers (Johnny Mathis, the late great pianist Oscar Peterson)Ella Fitzgerald has been slammed by some who have found her cool perfection boring, but this DVD makes it clear that she was anything but.  She may have been a letter-perfect recording artist, but her live performances are revelations!  Many of her televised and filmed performances (alone and with other artists) are filled with humor and exceptional warmth.  On the flip side, her stunning versions of ""Lover Man where can You be"" and ""Something to Live For"" prick the heart:  you can actually see and FEEL her pain and pathos.  As filmographies go, ""Something to Live For"" is as good it gets.  Highly recommended!",Ella Fitzgerald - Something to Live For VHS
266144,"I got my Star Wars DVD in yesterday, popped it in, relaxed (and enjoyed the movie).I'm not a huge fan of glossy looking movies; so the visual presentation of the original 1977 (Laserdisc to DVD transfer) of Star Wars was fantastic to me. I liked how the movie had that slightly grainy, maybe even ""dated"" look to it. I enjoyed the movie more because of it.(I was the same way with the 20th anniversary release of ""Alien"" vs. the picture quality of Alien in the ""Alien Quadrilogy"" set.)This doesn't mean I don't appreciate movies that are glossy, or older movies that get magnificent restorations such as ""Gone With The Wind"" or ""The Wizard of Oz"".Remember when you liked ""Star Wars"" for just being Star Wars?My review title was a light joke (for those that didn't pick up on it); if you want to pick up this DVD, along with ""Empire"" and ""Jedi""...""trust your feelings"" and do it.

Helen Mirren is also very good as his wife-and the mother of Georges' 15 children Charlotte.

I must say that, after reading the reviews by people who were obviously looking forward to a play-by-play take on ""Bewitched"", I stayed away from renting it. Then, fortunately, I was channel surfing and came across a truly, hysterically funny Will Ferrell riffing with a terrific support cast (Steve Carrell as Uncle Arthur is definitely worth your time) and a pretty darn good script. Leave it to the talented Nora Ephron to bring an air of smart sophistication to what is essentially a bunch of funny people being funny in the midst of a romantic comedy. Good show!",N/A

Yes, gone are all the hokey effects, the ""clamps and bits of wire"" and the sometimes entirely passable acting and rubber suits.Christopher Eccelston brings the Doctor to the new series and he is absolutely FANTASTIC (yes, one of his favorite sayings!). Billie Piper ROCKS as Rose. She is one of the best companion characters I have seen.And Russell... well, what can I say. He gets my vote as almost on level with Sydney Newman (he created Doctor Who, in case you didn't know) with just about a genius in regard to the way he resurrected a series, gave it a new flair and set it on the road to success. I will never question him for what he has done to bring back my all-time favorite series.OK... now a few notes about the new series.'Rose' is a great opening episode.I found 'The Unquiet Dead' to be quite a good episode and had a nice 'Who' touch to it.'Father's Day' is good with a nice performance by Billie Piper. The interaction between the Doctor and Rose's mum is not to be missed.'Dalek' let me down a little at the end, but it was a great start, had an almost Stargate quality about it.'Bad Wolf' has a great introduction to it.

1003708,"It's Flavor Of Love starring the one & only Flavor Flav and 20 beautiful women who are willing to do anything (lie, back-stab, cat-fight, snitch, etc.) to be the one woman by Flav's side. This show is HILARIOUS!20 women from various backgrounds compete to win Flav's love through challenges (cooking, gambling, 5 senses, etc.) to win a private date with Flav and through intimate one-on-one sessions to see what each girl is really about - Which girl really loves Flav and which girl is there to pursue her own interests (modeling, TV career or Flav's fame & fortune). Watching each girl's fate unfold through the eliminations is what keeps my interest in this show. Some of the girls were:NEW YORK - From day one, her focus was to have Flav for her very own. Making it clear that she would not ""play fair"" or ""make friends"", she creates as much drama as she can to eliminate the other girls. Her determination (& underhandedness) gets her as far as the final elimination (and subsequently another shot at Flav in Season 2).RED OYSTER - She's sexy, has a thing for the color red, and was Flav's self-appointed in-house spy. She made it her duty to inform Flav of any & all shady activities that the other girls were up to - with Flav's best interests at heart, of course. Quite a shocker to find out that she was still married while she was on the show.HOTTIE - Her appearance on ""Blind Date"" exposed her as a gold digger, A polygraph test revealed her as a habitual liar and her ""raw-chicken-with-veggies"" meal ceritfied her as the worst cook in the world. The whole ""I look like Beyonce"" thing was probably the funniest moment on the show.SERIOUS - The ""misunderstood"" model. Though she claims she wasn't there to further her modeling career, she didn't make her intentions with Flav clear enough - if she had any intentions at all.SWEETIE - Flav's mother said to him that Sweetie appeared ""desperate"" to win and during her final one-on-one she seemed to be coming on pretty strong with him, perhaps to stay in the competition. Maybe that was the reason she was eliminated. But I think Flav should have kept her (instead of Hottie) because despite her childhood trauma with chicken, she was a trooper and cooked it for him anyway.GOLDIE - I loved Goldie! I think she should have won! Of all the girls, she was the most down to earth and (according to the polygraph test) the most honest. In spite of the fact that she got a little TOO TIPSY before the first elimination, she proved that she could hold her own in the competiton. She was sweet, very funny and quite sexy, as demonstrated by that HOT kiss she laid on Flav during his date with her & New York (Goldie, where have you been!!!). Her admitting to Flav that she ""just wanted to be his friend"" was what eliminated her but I think if she really wanted him she could have been the winner. Flav was obviously ""feeling"" her.HOOPZ - The girl who came out on top. She was also very down to earth and very beautiful. She would not resort to the ""sexual tactics"" some of the other girls used to get Flav and that made her genuine. Her ace in the hole was when she went on the date with Flav & his mother after winning the ""chicken"" competition. She won over Flav's mom while being herself the whole time. Though later it would turn out that she and Flav were not meant to be, she deserved to win.I won't say much about the ""spitting incident"", other than it made Pumkin the worst contestant on the show and possibly all of reality TV.This DVD contains all of the episodes with uneditied language, some brief nudity, the reunion show (After The Lovin') and other extra features.This weekend we'll see the conclusion of Season 2 - will New York win this time?",Flavor of Love - The Complete First Season

Sure the special effects are cheesy, the sets look funny and the acting is laughable at times but for some reason this movie is just COOL! It's the type of scary which leaves a lot to the imagination which makes it all the more frightening. It's about a crew of men in space who's ship gets stranded on a planet inhabited by a man, Morbius and his beautiful daughter Alterra. The planet was once home to a race known as the Krell who dissapeared and left behind their mysterious brain enhancing technology. My favorite part is when the 'monster' melts through the solid metal door and all the alarms are going off, talk about suspense! Something about the sound of the alarms wailing in the background and the door turning red hot was REALLY frightening. It was totally freaky! It's not a bloody or violent film compared to movies of today but it scares you on a much deeper level, proving that OUR MIND can be a greater enemy than any monster.

721363,"Six Feet Under is the first American TV show I watched and loved. I'd seen some sit-coms and dramas before, ones that are hard not to see, even outside the US (Friends, Seinfeld, Sex and the City, etc.), but none of them struck me as true and real as SFU did. Going far beyond being true and real, SFU shows us moments that are disturbingly profound where we cannot but seriously examine our own lives along with those of the characters. In this regard, I think what Virginia Woolf said of a Shakespeare tragedy (Macbeth? Othello?) equally applies to SFU. Watch it once every year, and you will have a deeper understanding of life.I love each and every episode of SFU of all 5 seasons, but if I have to pick one favorite from the 1st season, it would be ""The Room."" Here, we, along with Nate, encounter the hidden, unknown aspects of Nathaniel Fisher, Sr. Nate remembers his recently deceased father as being manipulative, domineering, and retreating. So, it is with surprise and confusion that he embarks on the pursuit of knowing what his father was really like. Although he has glimpses of his father as a witty, wicked, weird, great guy, him now being dead, there's no way to know for certain.The episode is strongly suggestive of Paul Auster's The Invention of Solitude, equally pervaded with sadness and despair of not really knowing what our father was like, as a person. It contains one of the most memorable quotes from the show as well. When Nate gets to have a brief conversation with his father (the ""ghost"" of Nathaniel Fisher, Sr. appears at important moments througout the show) about the meaning of life, his father sums up the futility of pursuing such question by saying: ""Life is wasted on the living."" I often thought of this moment while I was reading Plato's Phaedo, another unabashedly serious investigation of the ""meaning of life"" and ""afterlife.""",N/A

The highlights are a production number on the wings of a moving airplane, and, of course, the overall chemistry between the two stars, which we were soon to see much, much more of.THE GAY DIVORCEE:A lively adaptation of the stage musical, which featured Astaire and his sister, Adele and the first film in which Astaire and Rogers actually received star billing. While vacationing at an English seaside resort, a soon-to-be-divorced woman mistakes a lovestruck song-and-dance man for her paid co-respondent. As usual, the plot's not important when you see these two and hear classics like Cole Porter's Night and Day.

An Astaire-Rogers musical featuring some of Irving Berlin's best songs including: ""Let's Face the Music and Dance,"" ""Let Yourself Go,"" ""We Saw the Sea."" Typical but delightful.SWING TIME:The fifth sublime teaming of Astaire and Rogers, SWING TIME is regarded by many as their finest film. The tenuous plot, which mainly serves to connect the brilliant dance numbers, concerns John ""Lucky"" Garnett (Astaire), a gambler and professional dancer. When Garnett arrives late to his wedding, his prospective father-in-law implements a punishment, insisting that Garnett raise $25,000 before he can marry Margaret Watson (Betty Furness). Still in tails, he hops a freight for New York, where he gets involved in a scrape with dance instructor Penny Carrol (Rogers). After following her to the dance studio, Lucky poses as a neophyte in need of training. Penny's boss Gordon (Eric Blore), happens to witness Lucky's incompetence, in the ""Pick Yourself Up"" number and is about to fire the young woman for nonperformance when Lucky launches into a dazzling display of terpsichorean skill. Impressed, the studio owner offers to get them an audition at the famed Silver Sandal nightclub. Arguably the peak of the Astaire-Rogers partnership, the dancers' nearly perfect blending of song, dance, wit, and decor only improves with time. Especially memorable are the subtly erotic tempo shifts of ""Never Gonna Dance"" and the coruscating technical command of ""Bojangles of Harlem,"" a tribute to the great African-American tap dancer.SHALL WE DANCE:The seventh feature starring the magical and incomparable dance team of Astaire and Rogers.Famous ballet star Petroff -- otherwise known as Pete Peters from Philadelphia, PA -- would rather tapdance than do grands jetes.

But she dashes all hopes of a pas de deux by informing him that she's about to get married and retire from the stage.Then, suddenly, rumors of a romance between the two get splashed on the cover of every newspaper tabloid... and everyone's plans are about to change.THE STORY OF VERNON & IRENE CASTLE:Fred and Ginger star in this musical tribute to a famous real life dance team. 20 years before Astaire and Rogers, there were the elegant Castles, so it was no surprise that the most famous dance pair of the silver screen ultimately played their illustrious predecessors. In the 1910s, Irene and Vernon Castle took the dances of the Americas, the tango of Argentina, the maxixe of Brazil, and the foxtrot of the United States to France and became the talk of Paris. With the Castles' success, the formal waltzes of the past gave way to the looser, ragtime-influenced choreography of the future. The plot follows the pair from their first audition as a team for a caf&eacute; in Paris through Vernon's enlistment as a flight instructor in the war. Director H. C. Potter stays true to the team, keeping all the song and the dance numbers typical of the early 20th Century. This is top-notch cinematic entertainment which includes over 40 pop songs from the past. Irene Castle herself diligently over saw the entire production.THE BARKLEYS OF BROADWAY:Astaire and Rogers come together one final time for this film. The magical pair play performers Josh and Dinah Barkley, whose act -- and marriage -- break up when Dinah decides to become a ""serious actress"". Among the unforgettable numbers are: ""They Can't Take that Away from Me"" (which Astaire and Rogers first performed in 1937's ""Shall We Dance""), ""Shoes With Wings On"", ""Swing Trot"" and ""You'd Be So Hard to Replace"".The price is no different to buying the two volumes separately, but the two-in-one format of this really appeals.

977295,"MNM vs London & KendrickQuite a good tag match. I was pleased with the result but found the aftermath slightly foolish. Still one of the better tag matches there have been lately though.RATING: 78/100Finlay vs. BenoitThis was a good, physical match that was successful but in some areas failed to keep me intrigued. Good quality wrestling throughout but at times lagged. Good length and some good innovative moves. Enjoyable matchRATING: 83/100Jilian vs. MelinaA much better match than I was expecting between these two. I was pleasantly surprised. But still not enough to match Mickie vs. Trish of late.RATING: 70/100Helms vs Super CrazyThis was a highly enjoyable match with some wonderful high flying moves. At 10 minutes in length, it was of sufficient time duration. The ending could have been stronger but that is no real problem.RATING: 80/100Angle vs. HenryI actually felt that this match was in a lot of ways better than there Royal Rumble match considering the way the match started at a very speedy pace and never really slowed down too much. The countout ending hurt the match a little bit as I think the aftermath should have probably been part of the match. I was impressed with Angle wrestling injured here.RATING: 76/100Booker T vs. LashleyBefore the match I was okay with a Booker win, but then I realised as the commentators stated it that I really don't want to hear Booker remind us every weak, so I suddenly sat on the edge of my seat hoping for a Lashley win. I was sure the match would belong to Lashley after his nice spear, but out of nowhere for no reason Finlay appeared and screwed Lashley. It seems as though the feud is back on, once again, out of nowhere.RATING: 78/100Khali vs. UndertakerThis match was poor. I wasn't expecting it to play out the way it did and I hated the sudden ending. Poor indeed.RATING: 61/100Rey vs JBLI liked Rey's offense in the beginning of the match and I thoroughly enjoyed the ""fairytale"" ending. I like the fact that they made this a grueling championship match rather than a victory out of nowhere. And what I like the most is that Rey won and we will not have to suffer another long JBL reign!RATING: 85/100PPV overall Impression = 72 + Match reviews 611/800 (76)74% -Matches were solid on the whole which made for a good feel to the general PPV but lacked anything memorable to make this PPV stand out.

228460,"The first 50 or so minutes of this film are terrific. The late Bruno Lawrence plays Zac Hobson, a scientist in New Zealand who wakes up one morning to find that everyone except him seems to have vanished from the face of the earth. We see him trying to cope with this state of affairs, going crazy and then slowly regaining his sanity while the world is silent around him. In these scenes, Lawrence gives a bravura performance which manages to stop short of hamming it up and really gets you caring about Zac's frail psyche. His descent and renewal are as gripping as any great moviemaking could be, done with only a few words, a few poignant gestures and deft editing and camerawork.Zac then finds out that he's not alone after all: first, a young woman named Joanne and then a burly Maori lorry-driver named Api find him and the three of them try to puzzle out why they're still on Earth and everyone else has vanished. It's at this point that the movie gets pretty soggy. There's a rather flimsy plotline about how an experiment funded by the big, bad USA somehow brought about this catastrophe, a love triangle that comes about just when you're hoping a love triangle WON'T come about, and an ending that smacks of the story petering out, as opposed to leaving you with tantalizing unanswered questions. So that's disappointing. But the first 50 minutes of THE QUIET EARTH are right up there with the first hour of THE BLACK STALLION, where the director uses all of the cinematic tools at his disposal to help you experience Zac Hobson's despair fully and completely. That's worth the viewing in and of itself.",The Quiet Earth VHS
347216,"This is just simply a very sweet and fun movie!  As others have noted, if you watch it in the belief that it's a Peter Sellers movie then you're going to be disappointed.  While Sellers' character is crucial to the film, he's not the star.  The stars of the film are two teenage actresses- Tippy Walker as ""Valarie 'Val' Boyd and Merrie Spaeth as ""Marian 'Gil' Gilbert.""  It's amazing that this movie was the debut for both- they just seem so natural.  (It's also surprising that neither acted much afterwards.)Gil and Val are two girls who have reached an age in which they're too old for toys, but too young for boys.  Further, they're young teens living during what John Waters has described as ""that weird time that was after Elvis, but before The Beatles.""  As Gil and Val struggle to adjust to their growing sense of maturity, they find comfort in a self-created fantasy world with Manhattan as the background to their flights of whimsy.  (I've lived in Manhattan for ten years, and I wish it looked as half as good as it is filmed here.)  By chance the girls find an object that becomes the intense focus for all their innocent romantic fantasies- Henry Orient (Sellers), an avant garde concert pianist of dubious talent who seems a lot more intersted in attempting to make married women ""hum"" than improving his non-Van Cliburn skills.Sellers' Orient is a truly unique character.  Born and raised in Brooklyn, he's adapted a pretentious non-descript Continental accent especially when wooing women, but when he gets flustered his native Brooklynese escapes his lips.  And Val and Gil certainly fluster Mr. Orient as they follow him around town, completely oblivious to the havoc that they're wreaking on his love life.The movie also delves into the home life of these two girls.  Gil, despite her parents being divorced, lives in a stable upper middle class home with her mom and her mom's friend.  On the other hand, Val's very wealthy and very busy parents (played by Tom Bosely and Angela Lansbury) are still married, but far from happily.  Eventually, Val's unhappy family life will interfere with her joyous fantasy world and bring it crashing down.Overall, this is just a very nice film about both the joy of being young and the difficulty of growing up.  I enjoyed it because of the acting and its endearing story.  I also enjoy it because it makes Manhattan in the early 60's look like such a great place to live- how nicely everyone is dressed and how clean the city looks!",N/A

968170,"I'm happy to report my Fourth Season DVDs played fine. More importantly, the series really comes into its own during its fourth year on the air. While most programs designed for an hour slot, Magnum and Higgins' characters have enough depth to them that each hour is something of a glimpse into their lives. In particular, you can't watch this season without appreciating something about Magnum's past influences, his father, author Raymond Chandler, Agatha Christie and others. While all of this is wrapped in the sometimes dated trappings of an '80s TV show, a lot of the substance of the show survives.This season includes what may be the best hour of television writing of its era, the Home from the Sea episode. As another reviewer mentioned, this is the ""treading water"" episode and it cemented many viewers' bond with Selleck's character. No staged fist fights, no explosions, no Ferrari chases. Not many episodes come close to this.Other memorable episodes include Distant Relative, which focuses on Rick, Rick's sister and Magnum as a ""babysitter"" for a not-too-innocent twentysomething. Letter To A Duchess, in which Higgins has a crush on a British woman who falls for Magnum, also stands out: all the right sets, enough action, and it illuminates the Magnum-Higgins relationship that turns out to be the show's core.Vietnam always lurks not far below the surface in the series, and The Look is an interesting (but dated) tie in to Magnum's past, with a female disc jockey who plays a role similar to Tyne Daly's female-friend-in-Vietnam from the excellent ""Jororo Kill"" episode in season two.Another brilliant episode: Operation Silent Night, in which the main characters are marooned on Christmas Eve on an island used for Navy gunnery practice. By this point in the series, the writers no longer had to rely on props like the Ferrari and the bikini babes at the King Kamehameha Club to make it work.On Face Value also rises to the top. An unexpected twist in a car chase puts Magnum into a wrenching situation, possibly the most affecting since Vietnam. An intense 'hour', all about character and inner struggle, with amazing performances by Selleck and Hillerman (Higgins). Overshadowed only by Home from the Sea.The fourth season includes some of the best, and some lesser material -- although even the Luther Gillis episodes have their moments. There are a few here you'll only watch once, but more that are lifetime keepers.",Magnum P.I.: The Complete Fourth Season
926998,"It was a neat premise: A Jewish girl brings her Palestinian boyfriend home to meet her supposedly tolerant parents. Might have been called ""Guess Who's Coming to Seder?"" The girl's family, of course, is completely dysfunctional. Brother tapes light switches in an effort to exercise his newly-found orthodoxy. Sister is a 28-year-old bellydancer who sleeps around with men she meets on the subway and still lives at home. Grandpa is a former Israeli soldier, blind, and boasts of how many Arabs he killed. Mother, meanwhile, runs around trying to keep the family from killing each other, and Father works night and day.Lots of potential. The political angle might have been interesting. But since everyone in the movie is secularized, there aren't many fireworks. Boyfriend quotes from the Koran and gets nods of approval from supposedly observant Brother. Grandpa's rants about killing Arbas barely ruffle Boyfriend. The movie soon dissolved into a comic farce, with everyone worried about whether Papa is fooling around in the office or is the mysterious fallen gentlemen who got bonked by a falling object.There were a couple of belly laughs, but mostly, the film was a faint echo of the powerhouse it could have been.",N/A

You probably know by now that it is based on an actual occurences in an Arkansas town which makes it all the more interesting a story.From the first few opening shots, it is apparent by the great use of the 2:35 widescreen frame that whoever made this film had experience and know how.  Too bad the picture changes to full frame after the opening credits on the available releases.I will agree that the comic releif elements (Dukes of Hazzard Roscoe P Coltrane style humor)scattered lightly throughout the film are a bit out of place but this did not hamper the experience for me. I never found the acting to be bad and Ben Johnson is a very well accomplished actor who has been in probably hundreds of movies with some of the biggest names in the industry.A cool looking masked killer and documentary style make for worthwhile viewing.

333820,"What a wonderful film. Too bad it isn't an accurate portrayal of events. Errol Flynn and Ronnie Raygun are in fine form as Jeb Stuart and George Custer respectively, but John Massey steals the show masterfully as John Brown. The racism that bubbles under the surface is the only thing keeping me from giving it five stars. So entertaining is this picture that one could easily be lured into its fantasies, especially if you aren't educated in history. John Brown was no villain; he was a true American patriot who dedicated (and ultimately gave) his life to rid our land of genocide. The sense of forboding over the foundation being laid for our Civil War is palpable, but again, the film tends to mislead one into the conclusion that slavery, not preservation of the Union, was the motivating factor. That's acribing too much false nobility to many Unionists who could have cared less about abolishing slavery. So, enjoy the film, yes, but temper it with a  heavy dose of those dusty old history books. You may just learn something...and it may just change your opinions of political events unfolding before us today.",N/A

985720,"I saw this movie in the theatre and thought it was pretty bad, save for the toilet using cat (hey, that's as lowbrow as it gets, but try not to laugh).  The ""Hitch"" thing was funny initially and I also enjoyed the absurdity of the ""Kill Bill"" spoof and Paris Hilton's burger commercial.  Those three or four moments earn this flick its one star; everything else is either predictable and unfunny (or predictably unfunny) or far worse.  The theatre was mostly silent during the whole affair (I counted two couples who walked out).  I was often the only one who could be heard laughing and I'm saying I thought the movie sucked (I guess I got more of the movie references than the rest of the people there, that's not to say they were actually all that funny, but I had to find something to laugh at).  It seemed to get worse, less funny, run out of ideas and get more random and tedious as it went along.  The last 15 to 20 minutes is a dreadful hodgepodge of random, lame ideas; and, while the movie is rather short, I was squirming and checking my watch about halfway through.Maybe this would play better at home and with lowered expectations (not that mine were all that high; these movie-spoofs have been pretty week the last few years).  My theory is these are now being made for a less discriminating and younger audience.  As with the new ""Scary Movie,"" er, movie, all the ""this is the funniest movie I've ever seen"" reviews here at Amazon are coming from a bunch of kids.  Now, I'm not that old myself, but the generation gap between generations X and Y is truly bigger than I ever imagined.  If you're between 10 and 17 this might be for you.  Those of us around long enough to see and appreciate truly great spoof movies will think this film verges on sacrilege.  Leslie Nielson and the Zuckers would be rolling over in their graves, had they died 5 years ago.Normally I would never say I would consider watching such a lousy movie again, but as always happens I am intrigued when the ""Unrated Version"" is released.  Usually DVDs that slap ""Unrated"" across the box actually include very few actual ""unrated""-worthy scenes.  Unless a movie as already rather raunchy, that ""Unrated"" is just used as a marketing tool and you never can tell what is really different about the new version.  ""Date Movie"" has a fare amount of lite-raunch, so the potential is there that some heavier stuff was left on the cutting room floor.  Until I see a few reviews saying this is indeed the case I'm not gonna risk it.  You may at your own risk, then let me know.  C'mon guys, lets see some reviews that compare the two.Till then, rent this version at your own risk.",N/A
949974,"Only in the postmodern era could a film of such content achieve notoriety as a ""horror film"".  ""Emily Rose"" is more an exercise on the ins and outs of religious faith within the framework of the American legal system than a horror movie, an interesting meditation on how belief in the metaphysical goes over in complicated situations like the tragic one depicted here. Having read about the actual case which really took place in Germany and did not for a second involve the Catholic Church, I thought it was a little distasteful that the director decided to suggest here and there that this might have been a real case of possession.As far as the movie itself goes, though, the meticulous construction and ill-fated plight of Emily Rose (Anneliese Michael) manages to entertain and even get a tad spooky here and there.  Needless to say, this only happens when the fictitious elements are added.  It is above all worth watching as a courtroom drama.  Tom Wilkinson is utterly forgettable as Father Moore and Jennifer Carpenter delivers a fairly convincing performance as Emily Rose in both her ""normal"" state and ""possessed"" state.Laura Linney and Campbell Scott, however, are phenomenal as two lawyers bent on both stealing the spotlight and proving each other wrong.  At times you really can't help but side with the prosecution, though, as Linney is clearly unprepared for the case despite her character's supposed voracious drive for victory.  How you could pull off an even tentative acquittal such as the one Moore receives at the end is beyond me in this particular case, but she manages it.For my part, I was not left with the desire to watch the film again and again.  Although the plotline was elaborate, coherent and gripping, I found the ""exorcism"" scenes ridiculously short and unconvincing.  What you are left with here is not a burning question as to whether Emily was really possessed or just epileptic, but tremendous pity for her psychological and physiological suffering.That said, this is worth watching.  Maybe some aspiring horror director will pick up on the good parts and make another actually frightening film about exorcism.",N/A

863524,"1. Rey Mysterio & Matt Hardy vs. Snitsky & Chris MastersOriginally, Edge came out, but then refused to wrestle so Snitsky came out to take his place. This match could have been better if Edge was wrestling, because Mysterio and Hardy had to carry most of, if not the entire match. Snitsky is dreadful in the ring, and Masters is still developing at this point. This is still a good opener that gets the crowd pumped up for the show. Rey and Matt put on good performances, and do some cool moves. Pretty good match, worth a watch. 6/102. Eugene & Jimmy ""Superfly"" Snuka vs. Rob Conway & Tyson TomkoPretty boring, considering none of these men, other then Superfly, are capable of putting on anything more then a snoozefest of a match. Conway is pretty limited, and Tomko and Eugene were never meant to be wrestling in the first place, and are simply awful. The only noteworthy spot of the match is Superfly getting tagged in to wrestle for about 15 seconds, then going off the top rope for the splash. The rest is poorly wrestled, bland, and boring. 2/103. Three Faces of Foley Match: Mankind vs. CarlitoI'm glad that the fans picked Mankind as the face of Foley to face Carlito, because Mankind had not been seen for quite some time in the WWE, and it was refreshing. Carlito is similar in that he is something new and different for the WWE, and he brings life to the ring when he steps in. He has great character, and his in ring skills, though not fantastic here, have greatly improved since. He is entertaining here, and him and Foley put on a good show. Short, but it was never meant to be a wrestling classic, just a fun match to keep the show moving. Both Foley and Carlito put on good performances. 7/104. World Tag Team Championship Match: Lance Cade & Trevor Murdoch vs. Kane & Big ShowThis one suprised me, because I thought this would be boring and slow. At some parts it is, but it picks up in a few places, and is overall entertaining. It does its job by putting over Kane and Big Show as the new tag team on Raw, and they work well together. Cade and Murdoch hold this one down a little, but it doesn't hurt the match too much. Worth a watch. 6/105. Street Fight Match: Batista vs. Jonathan Coachman w/ Goldust and VaderI think the original plan was to have Austin face Coach, but that fell apart so instead the WWE picked the Animal himself to face good ol' Coach. Anyway, this is quite short and there really isn't much to this one, except for Coach getting beaten pretty badly. Basically a time filler, you can skip this and you won't miss much. 3/106. Fufill Your Fantasy Battle Royal Match for the Women's Championship: Trish Stratus (c) vs. Ashley vs. Candice Michelle vs. Mickie James vs. Maria vs. VictoriaThe fans decided that the Divas should wrestle the match in lingerie, and I am not complaining about that decision at all. Other then Victoria, this match is very ""easy on the eyes"" if you know what I mean, and isn't that bad. Trish and Maria make the match for me, this is certainly worth a watch for the lovely eye candy. 5/107. Steel Cage Match for the Intercontinental Championship: Ric Flair (c) vs. Triple HAs Joey Styles stated, this match was not really for the Intercontinental Championship, but was extremely personal. Triple H completed the demise of Evolution by beating his former best friend to a bloody pulp. Flair seeks revenge inside of the 15 foot high Steel Cage, and Triple H dominates a majority of this match. Flair comes back swinging, literally (you'll see what I mean), and escapes the cage after going through a brutal 24 minutes. He proves he can still wrestle one hell of a match, and this sets up their rematch at Survivor Series in a Last Man Standing Match, where Triple H is the one seeking revenge. A great match, these two click and make this one bloody, brutal brawl. 9/108. Triple Threat Match for the WWE Championship: John Cena (c) vs. Kurt Angle vs. Shawn MichaelsCena really didn't have to do much in this match, because the fans voted HBK as the third man in this match, and when you put the Showstopper and the olympic gold medalist in the same ring, you're going to get a good, if not great, match. All three men put on good performances, and HBK and Angle continue their rivalry by taking out Cena with an announce table spot and fighting by themselves for a good 5 minutes. HBK proves that he deserved the fans votes for the second year in a row at this event, and all three men work very well here. Good match, everybody has chemistry together and this is one of Cena's best title defenses. 8.5/10Taboo Tuesday is better then the previous years' event, and is overall, a pretty good PPV. The undercard leaves a lot to be desired, but the uppercard is good. Two great matches and a few fun matches make this one worth watching.Match of the Night: The Steel Cage match: Ric Flair vs. Triple H. This is a bloodbath, but a damn entertaining one at that.

772693,"I have never read the book by Boris Pasternak nor have I seen the original 1965 movie (I plan on reading the book and renting the David Lean version soon, though).  That said, I loved it!  I was really impressed by Keira Knightley's performance, especially as she was only 16 or 17 at the time.  Hans Matheson plays the torn poet/physician to perfection. (Other reviewers who panned the two leads must have a different standard of acting than I have...they were great in my book.) Yury Zhivago and Lara cross each other's path three times b/f they work side-by-side as doctor and nurse during the end of WWI and the onset of the Russian Revolution. Lara peers into the window of a cafe where Yury is sitting with Tonya and his friend, Mischa (the three friends are discussing the nature of love and whether or not it can be analyzed); the future lovers' eyes meet and they exchange smiles.  Their second meeting is more dramatic. Dr. Zhivago resuscitates Lara's mother after she attempts suicide. Their third meeting is the most dramatic. Before the Revolution, Lara tries to avenge the seedy Komarovsky, who has misused her.  She interrupts an aristocratic party that Yury attends by storming in and firing at Komarovsky; unfortunately, she misaims. Boris Pasternak penned a villain we love to hate in the character of Komarovsky: an opportunist without much of a conscience.  His urbane mannerisms do little to compensate for his complete want of emotional intelligence or integrity.  Lara feels defiled by the same man who was only a short while ago her mother's lover.  When she tries to break with Komarovsky, he won't let her, and from then on, he unrelentingly pursues her.Yury does love Tonya, but I get the idea that his love for his wife is more of a friendship and based on Yury's sense of obligation to his adoptive family. (Yury and Tonya were basically raised as brother and sister, so I can see how it would be difficult from Yury's perspective to suddenly transform his brotherly affections for Tonya into a passionate, romantic love, despite Tonya's many noble characteristics.) Mischa loves Tonya romantically, but never acts on his feelings and remonstrates Yury for not fully appreciating Tonya. (The actor who plays Mischa is very handsome, by the way.) Lara marries Pasha, a young man who will soon help bring about a bloodbath in the name of the Revolution and because of a misguided attempt to protect and impress Lara (in such a way that will only further endanger and horrify her). Pasha senses that Lara does not really love him romantically, and he resents that his wife ""treats him like a child."" They have a daughter together, as Yury has children with Tonya. One of the themes of this movie seems to be mismatched couples.  Yury delivers (in my opinion) the film's most memorable lines when he says to Lara, ""I wish I could live two lives.  My own and the other to see you well and happy...""I read in another review for this movie that in the novel, Yury has another lover whom he has known since childhood (Marina). This movie makes no reference to Dr. Zhivago's third lover.I'm glad that Pasha lived to regret his mistakes and rued that after all the bloodshed (no small part of which was at his direct orders), men like Komarovsky were still in power both before and after the Revolution (and despite the ideals of a ""classless"" society, lived in luxury).  Sam Neill was uncanningly convincing as Komarovsky, one of fiction's most detestable villains. (Don't get me wrong, I'm sure Sam Neill isn't really like the character he portrays, but his acting is so ""method"" :-), that he leaves chills.)This series was very well done, and I look forward to comparing this remake with the original movie. This remake integrates archival film clips into the movie, which makes the movie even more haunting, as a love story becomes a history lesson (also, we see the real victims of these harsh times, not actors portraying them).

He wrote, ""I always believed that miracles can happen.  You just have to be at the right place at the right time.""The tragic loss of his mother led to a cruel English boarding school experience.  Begging to leave, he came out into the spacious freedom of a demanding but beloved tutor, who inspired a love of learning and knowledge.  It served as preparation for Oxford University.His education was interrupted by what was called ""The Great War.""  Did the tragedy and horror of it confirm his atheism?  Wounded in battle, he returned to his studies and Christian friends like J.R.R. Tolkien, who challenged his atheistic assumptions.His defenses began to crumble when he realized that not only were his best friends Christian, his favorite books were written by Christian authors.  He could no longer deny God's existence and felt the pressure of God's pursuit.He had been filled with trepidation at the thought of becoming a believer, but in 1929 he reluctantly surrendered.  It was anything but joyous.But years later, after a career in writing had emerged, he agreed to meet with an American woman who had written him.  This seemingly insignificant event would forever change his life.  He was at the right place at the right time.  Joy Gresham would become his friend, and later to make it possible for her to stay in England, Lewis agreed to a hasty ""paper"" marriage.It was the tragedy of Joy's cancer that brought their love to the surface, which led to a real marriage before God.  At last Lewis would know the joy in his sixties that he had been denied in his twenties.  This pleasure would prove to be fleeting, as Joy's recovery was only temporary.She eventually succumbed leaving Lewis to question the faith he had espoused and defended.  In back of all the twists and turns in his life, stood the God who helped Lewis and his stepchildren carry on.All of these scenes and more are beautifully depicted in this dramatic presentation.  Amazingly, it condenses into 54 minutes all the periods and highlights of his life.  The pacing is even and relaxed; it never feels rushed.This is not a documentary.  An assortment of actors, including a man who looks like an older Lewis, vividly and expertly recreate his life.The promotional DVD copy opens with an advertisement for this production and did not have any of the bonus features listed on the box.  This includes Lewis and Narnia trivia, information about Lewis and a few other items related to the Narnia books.The presentation opens with Lewis as a child exploring an old cottage.  Then it flashes forward to 1963 with the older Lewis narrating his story.  The different episodes are played out in between narration and commentary.  Lewis serves as a guide; everything comes to us from his perspective.As you might expect, this is more realistic and less dramatic than ""Shadowlands,"" the popular Hollywood version of his life.  It also has a warmth and production that exceeds the PBS story.  This may be the best and is probably the most concise depiction of Lewis on film.Those who know his story may not learn anything new, but this works because it's well-done, entertaining and realistic.  It's a loving depiction that serves as a great follow-up to the ""Narnia"" movie.  It takes us beyond Narnia to show us the miracle of the life behind it.",C.S. Lewis: Beyond Narnia

I had the soundtrack, I knew every line, I knew the choreography every dance step and swivel and thrust. Jennifer Grey was me, big nose, bad perm and small chest. Patrick Swayze, well he didn't exist in my world, so I had to watch his again and again. We all knew the ""I carried a watermelon"" and ""nobody puts baby in the corner"" but did we really know why we even felt so passionate about it in the first place? The story being set in the late 50's, the setting at a family vacation spot, the outsider looking in, dancing, forbidden love, mystery, it all entered our psyches as THE perfect movie and never lost its footing. Could Patrick Swayzes white t-shirt be any tighter, could Jennifer Grays smirk be any cuter, could Jerry Orbach be a more perfect protective father?  NO! After this came out, I saw advertisements for learning how to ""dirty dance"" and asked my parents, with me being in ballet and jazz, what was one more class? Well it turns out 14 year olds shouldn't be gyrating against each other, who knew? I still learned them, by watching the tape over and over, but my partner was a girl named April and I think we giggled too much. Now that I think about it, if anyone had caught us I would have been straight to therapy.

79795,"I absolutely love this beautiful film.  I saw it many years ago and was too young to really appreciate everything it has going for it I guess.  So, if you happen to be one of those who have not watched this since the first time, or one of those who seem to have such negative feelings about it, please do yourself a favor and rewatch this.  If you have never watched it, DO SO NOW. No one can really miss what a beautiful film this is, can they?  I have read every  review here because even that brings back so much of the intense beauty of this film.  This cast could not have been better chosen.  Everyone seems like the ""real character"" and of course Fiennes is always great.  It never even occurred to me to find anything offensive about the fact that, especially during a war, people had affairs.  This is just plain truth.  However, maybe the real problem with those who find this offensive is that you find yourself wanting this couple to have it all.  You don't care that this affair is illicit. You understand the affair. You want these lovers to be able to be together.  This couple should be together. (She's married to a man who is so emotionally frail he would rather see her dead than allow her to be happy with another man.  So this marriage was in trouble anyway.)  But this film is about far more than just this affair.  The use of the flashback telling of this tale makes you painfully aware of what a beautiful, vibrant man the patient was and then the wreckage he became. There is so much pain and suffering involved in all this.  At times it is hard to watch....you feel so desperate for these people.  Even so, this is one of the greatest tragic romances in film, I think. I watch this  over and over in any given year.  Don't take anybody's word for it....watch it for your own benefit.  You won't be sorry if you do.",N/A
962228,"""The Squid and the Whale"" is a movie that shows us something we'd rather not see: The ugly side of divorce. I've always been fascinated with the way Hollywood portrays divorce. They never really portray it as something that is truly horrible, just as a ""touch luck/too bad"" thing that happens to many people. In other words, divorce is a part of human nature, and you might as well get used to it. Of course, people who have been effected by divorce will tell you otherwise. The fact that so many divorcees can watch Hollywood movies about divorce shows just how timid and kind Hollywood is to the subject.This is not one of those movies. This movie will not hold your hand and demand you not be scared by divorce. This movie does no less then get in your face and practicably beats you over the head with the horrible consequences of divorce. You may actually feel yourself worn out by the time the movie is finished. If you couldn't guess by now, the movie is about a married couple named Bernard and Joan, and their two kids Frank and Walt. Bernard and Joan have a rocky relationship. Bernard used to be a huge author, but now has trouble getting his books published. Joan used to have little interest in writing, but was inspired by her husband to try writing herself.Now the tables have turned some twenty years later, and now Joan is the successful writer and Bernard is the one with no career. They now fight all the time, with Bernard getting frustrated that he seems to be losing his power status with the family, and Joan feeling like her husband would rather have her on a leash. Soon the parents decide to divorce, to the surprise of no one (even to Frank and Walt). The kids aren't really surprised when their parents announce that they are splitting up, but they still can't really comprehend how things came to be this way. What's worse is that both kids have a parent he likes better, and the parents use this to their advantage.In what comes as the biggest blow to the audience, each of the grownup's start telling their kids stories about the other parents and giving that kid special privileges. Bernard tells Frank about affairs Joan has while they were married, and Joan lets Walt drink beer and read pornographic magazines. The bait serves it's purpose, and before you know it Frank and Walt have become pawns in their parents bickering match, and neither side will waver. A particularly heartbreaking scene comes in when Frank starts dating a girl. Both his parents have advice for him, but none of the advice he receives in on the same level, and Frank messes up with the girls because he can't decide which parent to listen to.Meanwhile, Walt picks up a couple of (truly disgusting) bad habits in order to get his parents attention, only to find out that his parents aren't really interested in solving the problem, but are rather more interested in seeing how they can put the blame for this behavior on one another. The squid and the whale is a metaphor, but what the metaphor is I won't tell you. As stated before, ""The Squid and the Whale"" is a tough movie. It takes a problem we are all too familiar with, and it presents it to us in away that many of us are unaware exists. The movie has some problems (the dad's affair with a student could have been handled better), but it is an excellent achievement in film.The movie has been playing in limited release, and it is definitely worth hunting down. It may be something you don't normally expect to see from your movies, but it does pay off quite well.",N/A
157241,"THE VAMPIRE LOVERS is generally considered to be the best of the Hammer Films ""Carmilla Trilogy"" and the most faithful to J. Sheridan LeFanu's original story.In THE VAMPIRE LOVERS a frankly lesbian Carmilla Karnstein spends most of the film seducing and drinking the blood of several lovely young ladies in eighteenth century Austria.Like most Hammer productions THE VAMPIRE LOVERS relies heavily on stylism, and because the film is largely a straightforward retelling of LeFanu's tale, the storyline never sags. The sexual element is very much in evidence, serving as the underpinning of this film. There are a fair number of bare breasts and nubile bodies upon which Carmilla feeds, and the dialogue (much of it lifted from LeFanu) is classically Victorian and tastefully erotic.THE VAMPIRE LOVERS is an entertaining and well-made THREE AND-A-HALF STAR film, and possibly the best of its genre.",N/A

The proof is in their careers - both actors gave their best performances in this movie, while they were yet still unpolished performers.  Gene Hackman was great with a superb dry wit and great sense of timing.There are plenty of places to get a review of the plot so I'll skip it, but the sense of hope Superman brings to this film is great.

970638,"Who knew that someone could do so much while driving his or her car? Ellie Parker (the lovely Naomi Watts) has raised multi-tasking to a new level. None of what she does looks remotely safe so I wouldn't recommend you try what she pulls off so adeptly in her whirlwind drive around the hills and studios of Hollywood for auditions. She talks on the cell phone, eats blue ice cream, and the car is her dressing room as she fixes her hair and makeup, and changes into various costumes.As the mercurial Ellie Parker, Naomi Watts is a real hoot playing her sort of semi-autobiographical self, years before she skyrocketed to fame in David Lynch's MullHolland Drive.  Delightfully displaying her comic talents, Watts plays a frustrated actress thrashing around the low end of the Hollywood food chain. Expanded from actor Scott Coffey's short, Ellie Parker features a few days in the life if Ellie as she struggles to define herself in the City of fame and dreams.We first meet her as she's on her way to audition for a Southern Bell and she's channeling her inner Scarlett for a bored young director named Smash. Of course the audition is just one of a number that morning. Soon after it's completed she jumps into her Honda and drives to the next tryout, singing along to Blondie whilst rehearsing a New Jersey junkie-whore accent.Ellie's personal life is also rather unstable. She's unsure whether she wants to stay with her hunky loser musician boyfriend (Mark Pellegrino). When she meets cute Chris (Coffey), an appealing but flighty alleged cinematographer after a car accident, she indulges in an intermittent flirtation with him. She's also crying on the shoulder of cynical actress pal Sam (Rebecca Rigg) who's both savvier and less principled than her friend - she makes up childhood traumas for their method-acting class.The movie was obviously a labor of love the Ms. Watts and what you see here is probably what you get. She's bawdy, irreverent, and sometimes crude, and also terribly insecure about her talent as an actress. The irony is that she is talented - her track record has since proved it - but the movie's point is that she doesn't yet realize it and she ultimately fails to believe in herself. Effectively skewering the Hollywood scene, Ellie Parker is about an industry where everyone is looking for his or her ten minutes of fame and where no one really knows who he or she is, and there's a real sense of biding time for the big role you haven't yet read for.At ninety minutes the original conceit of the movie tends to wear a bit thin and you can feel the original short slowly being stretched to breaking point, but the film remains surprisingly enjoyable. The industry in-jokes are wicked and mordent and Ellie's emotional exhaustion is fully felt as she wonders whether to just throw in the towel and quit acting for good.Elle Parker ultimately stands as definitive evidence of Watts' formidable comic and dramatic talent and her uncanny ability to transform herself - she reveals a totally unglamorous and vulnerable side that few other A-list actresses would ever allow us to see. At the same time she's imparting insight into the very real struggle of an actor's dedication and ""process.""  In this respect, the film is probably required viewing for just about every other struggling actor in Hollywood. Mike Leonard April 06.",N/A

962243,"This was billed as a comedy. It wasn't. Unless it's funny to watch miserable, irrevocably damaged people doing horrible things to each other, themselves, their children, and your own youthful idealism. For me, it was like getting poked in the eye with a pencil -- over and over. I kept standing there, expectant, hopeful, naive, thinking maybe I wouldn't get poked in the eye any more times, but inevitably it came -- the eye poke.The movie is a long gauntlet of awkward situations, and unforgettably dreadful moments. There is no forgiveness, no redemption, no hope -- there is only wound heaped upon scar, from parent to child and back again, and from spouse to spouse -- kind of like the tennis that is a motif in the film. If you feel the need to cringe, here is your opportunity. I don't think my shoulders relaxed once throughout the movie, although their were many times when I stopped cringing with horror in order to clutch my mouth and say, ""He did NOT just do/say that.""I am not a person who needs things to be all joyful or demands the happy ending. I have never said, nor will I ever say, ""Can't we all just get along?"" However, tomorrow is my ninth wedding anniversary, and this movie makes marriage, parenthood, or really any relationship at all with another person just seem like a toxic prison, from which there is no escape but nihilism. NEAT! Happy anniversary to me!!For what it's worth, I also predicted everything that happened in the film as we went through it, including the development of the motif in the title. It was predictable in the wide view, but as for the many little barbs and spears that are thrown along the way -- unless you're as bloodless and depraved as the characters in the movie, you'll never see them coming.I think, as a sidenote, this is the best acting Jeff Daniels has ever done.

860830,"Blowing away all expectations I had for it, ""Anacondas: The Hunt For The Blood Orchid"" was something that looked like it might be pretty good, but was among the last movies I would have expected to be one of 2004's top films.  Far and away one of the best of the action/horror hybrids that have become very prevelant recently.A jungle setting for a horror movie - with all its exotic danger and the hint of unknown discovery around every corner - or every tree or fern mass - is a natural fit, but the idea fell into disrepute and virtual disuse for a number of years because of a few really bad movies quite a while ago.  The jungle theme was common for a while, but circa the 1970s a number of low-budget (not All of the low-budget jungle horror movies by any means, but a few rotten apples often leave a bad stain on the whole barrel) jungle movies - usually in the 'cannibal' subgenre (again, not the entire subgenre was like this) ruined it for everybody with blatant and ridiculous racist tones, and with inserting unsimulated violence (killing real animals; rounding up newsreel footage from war zones of real violence to humans and splicing it in).  The jungle setting is now making a comeback with legitimate movies like the ""Anaconda"" fims and a number of Southeast Asian horror movies, which because of the geographical region they're from are as likely to feature jungle locales as horror movies from the West are to use forest locales.  It's time once again to let the giant cave-dwelling jungle monsters and the sinister happenings on the banks of rainforest rivers run free!""Anacondas: The Hunt For The Blood Orchid"" has a simple plot done to maximum effectiveness.  In Borneo, a flower called the 'Blood Orchid"" is known from discovery and description of a single specimen in the late 1800s by a botanist.  In recent times, the plant has been rediscovered and found by a small team of researchers to apparantly have uncanny cellular properties: it can severely retard, possibly even halt, aging.  And preliminary research shows that it may very likely be able to be used to make pharmaceuticals that would have the same effect on humans.  The orchid only blooms once every few years, and is nearing the end of its current period's active stage.  A team of researchers is hurriedly dispatched to Borneo where they have to hire a local independantly-owned riverboat to take them up the river to the Orchid's location, because no large commercial operation will sail the interior waterways during the treacherous rainy season.  Inside the jungle wait impossibly large snakes, unbeknownst to all involved.Sounds like it might be a fairly good watch but nothing that exciting, right?  But everything that can possibly elevate this movie does so, and does so in spades.  The characters initially seem like they're going to be pretty generic and bland but quickly develop into far more interesting players.  A monkey who lives with the riverboat's captain (I can't remember the little fella's name.  It may have been Kong or that may have been the small primate who played him) adds a great deal to the proceedings, both in cute/funny ways and in other aspects.  The Indonesian rainforest setting is gorgeous and intimidating in its scope at the same time, and is captured very, very well by great cinematography.  The action sequences are intense and, in general, more believable than in most big action fare  (There's one exception and it's one of the only flaws in the whole movie.  It's probably not giving much away to say that both the anacondas and the humans take their hits, but there's One instance where one individual goes down far, far easier than is consistent with the rest of the movie.  A very minor point when that's the worst thing wrong)  There are genuine shocks and jolts.  The occasional humor is well-done and not insulting to watch.  Great overall pacing.There's one aspect of the movie that's very intriguing that I'd like to touch on briefly.  It's probably not giving anything away because I think most of this was in the trailers, but I'm going to put a spoiler warning on it anyway.**WARRNING: POSSIBLE SEMI-SPOLIERS AHEAD**Okay, the anacondas are huge in this movie because anacondas never stop growing while they're alive, and their lifespans are greatly expanded because the Blood Orchid is in their food chain (Presumably they don't eat the flower, but eat something that does eat the flower).  Okay, so if they live longer they would get a lot bigger.  But - they're smarter too.  It's handled in a very subtle way, but they seem to be utilizing more strategy than you'd expect a snake to, and in one part, although it's never spelled out, I got the impression that two or more snakes were co-operating to 'herd' their human prey.  Not typical snake behavior, I don't think.  Plus, they're Very fast.  Snakes can be pretty bloody fast for short bursts but these behemoths are practically flying through the jungle at times.  Presumably this isn't a side effect of their longer lifespans, but unrelated changes brought on by the Orchid being part of their food chain.So my question is, What other changes - in addition to longevity - may have cropped up in other inhabitants of the jungle where the Orchid grows, either in other animals or in the area's indigineous tribes?I didn't anticipate saying this when I rented ""Blood Orchid"", but I want an ""Anaconda 3"" (or some differently titled sequel if it's other lifeforms that form the plot basis)",N/A
601899,"A man approaches a salvage team to tow an old Italian cruise ship with a jinxed past.The best part of this movie was the opening scene on the cruise ship where the wealthy voyagers were slaughtered.  I'm not sure if I'd say it was believable, but it was certainly a sweet effect.Julianna Margulies and Gabriel Byrne are in the movie - definite plus!!  Some of the ghosts were kind of cool, including the little girl and the sexy young singer.The movie does have some decent scenes, but overall it was lacking the uneasy or eerie feeling a haunted place would have.  This is a MUST for any ghost story.  Without it, everything is just bland.Plus the ending lacked imagination....or rather they tried to throw in a twist, but it just wasn't an interesting one. There was relatively little to no foreshadowing about the man who approached the team, so when the time came about for the twist  I was left with a disappointed feeling of,  ""oh. they're going to end it that way.""",N/A
641709,"The United States is a great place for the creation of dreams. It's citizens are privileged to seek fame or fortune or to alter those of others. Those fragile fortunes always stride hand in hand with the fear of losing them. In the 1950's when the country was riding the high road of prosperity, Americans were enjoying the benefits of the second world war. With little to fear, it was left to the government to create one. It was called the ""Red scare"" or Communism. Most Americans were too complacent to worry about it. Thus it was left to one man to not only terrorize us with that fear, but to cultivate it. That individual was Joseph MaCarthy who hitched his star to a threat not of his creation, but his decision to feed, nurture and manipulate it to destroy the lives, careers and dreams of many citizens. In this remarkable film, audiences are given the rare opportunity to witness the classic confrontation between the Junior senator from Wisconsin and the controversial, chain-smoking hero of CBS, one Edward R. Murrow (superbly play by David Strathairn.) The film is in Black and white as were the issues of the day. Noted for it's caricatures of the CBS news staff, the film pointedly reveals the uncertainties, triumphs and tragedies of the times. A courageous attempt to remind modern audiences that our present dreams and fears are no less precarious. With the government adroitly using the fears of global terrorism, a man like Edward Murrow is not only welcomed, but long overdue. ****",N/A

This video also used the same janitor as in the video Smells like Teen spirit. Dick Van Patten also turns in a stellar performance.5.You Dont Love me Anymore- 1992, This song is an Al Original although the video was closely modeled after ''More than Words'' by Extreme.6.Bedrock Anthem- Parody of Under the Bridge and Give it Away by the Red Hot Chili Peppers, Shot in 93- This video was shot on the same exact patch of dessert as the original. The Bee Girl from the Blind Melon video makes an appearance, as does Al's Aunt Dot.7.Gump- Parody of ''Lump'' by The Presidents Of The United States Of America shot in April Of 1996, Al tells the complete story of Forrest Gump In under 2 minutes.

I have to say this video is brilliant. This is one of my favorite Weird Al Videos. It incorporates Devo style with Weird Als Genius.11.Eat It- Febuary of 1984, Parody of '' Beat It'' by Michael Jackson. Al's Grammy Award Winning Parody ''Eat It'' was an immediate international success.12.Like A Surgeon, Parody of Madonna's '' Like A Virgin'' filmed in March of 85, this video was filmed in an actual hospital that had gone out of business. This, along with the videos ''Dare to be Stupid'' & One More Minute were done as part of a home-video release and television special called '' The Compleat Al''.13.UHF, shot in June 1989- The video shot for the Original Themesong from Al's Movie was perhaps his most ambitious to date.

Al's long time band members  Jim West, Steve Jay and Jon ''Bermuda'' Schwartz supply the cheesy choreography. Also watch for Al ripping up a picture of the woman who inspired the song.16.I Lost On Jeopardy, Parody of Jeopardy by Greg Kihn, shot in 1984, is a nostalgic tribute to the old Jeopardy game show. Cameos by original host Art Fleming & original show announcer Don Pardo. Al's mentor Dr. Demento, Al's real parents and Greg Kihn himself.17.This is the Life- filmed in 84 its a 1930's flavored original and was the theme song for the 1930s gangster spoof ''Johnny Dangerously'' with Micheal Keaton and Danny Devito.18.Living With A Hernia, Parody of ''Living In America'' by James Brown.

Shot in 96.20.Ricky- Parody of ''Mickey'' by Toni Basil, Filmed in April of 83, this one was Al's Music Video Debut. This was arguably the first comedy video ever shown on MTV.21.Christmas At Ground Zero- This cheery Phil Spector inspired original tune about death, destruction and the end of the world was largely banned by broadcasters, that somehow decided it was a tad morbid to play a song about nuclear annihiliation during the Holidays.

689589,"I caught this one on cable just a few nights ago and I have to admit I laughed my you know what off.  I think my teenaged son laughed harder than I did.  This is like Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon Meets the Mighty Ducks.  A former soccer great called Golden Leg Funghad his career ruined after a gangster caused him to break his legendary leg.  years later, Fung meets a Kung Fu Master named Sing whose steel leg can do wonders on a soccer ball.  Sing is a Bruce Lee look-alike and even wears the yellow jump suit that Lee wore in Game of Death.  Fung reunites Sing with his former Shaolin brothers and puts their remarkable Kung Fu skills to work on the soccer field.  The brothers all have names which are clues to their Kung Fu Skills such as Iron Head, Lighting Hands, Iron Shirt Tin, and hooking leg.Together they form one outrageous teams complimented by Matrix like special effects as  balls are kicked and scream like rockets, trailing fire and tearing up the field as they fly towards the opponents goal.  Or Hooking Leg demonstrates the most incredible degree of hook ever seen as his kicks turn 90 degrees.  Fung sets them up for a run in a bis soccer tournament and a show down with the team of the mob leader who caused his injury years earlier.  His team is called the dastardly ""Team Evil"" just in case their black uniforms and scowls didn't tip you off.The formula works like any of those American films such as Mighty Ducks, Bad News Bears or the like.  Shaolin Soccer is like watching a live action cartoon with the wild, slap-stick action and special effects.  The cast is hilarious with brilliant one-liners and facial expressions.  The film is dubbed in English.  Star Steven Chow directed the film and Chow also directed the highly successful Kung Fu Hustle that came out in 2005.",Shaolin Soccer
90717,"Over the years, people have grown tired of natural disaster movies.  Why?  Because they all appear to be the same.  Here's an example of a typical storyline- everything starts out nice and calm, the story focuses on one family, the family starts having problems and they split up, and then a volcano, tornado, hurricane, or whatever hits, and all the family members somehow miraculously avoid the incredible danger JUST so they can be together again and make up with each other by the end of the movie.Well, that kind of typical storyline isn't featured here.  Twister is truly a classic.  It's not ordinary, either.  It's about a group of tornado chasers who, as you guessed, drive around speeding through the country in an attempt to get never-before-seen film of a twister, up close and personal.This means the film delivers the most amazing action I have honestly ever seen in a tornado movie.  Twister is definitely better than most of the similar type of films, and I remember in 1996 how influential this movie was.  I was in 9th grade, and the science teacher played Twister for the class a couple times throughout the year because it was SO good and much better than other tornado films.Helen Hunt plays a magnificent role.  She is so obsessed with her love of twisters that she barely seems to care about the divorce she's going through.  What's great about this is that, despite giving us a really good story about a divorce, this doesn't interfere with all the tornado action.  There are *so* many good scenes in Twister that show the devastation tornadoes are capable of that it's simply amazing to me how much time and energy had to happen to make this movie.Favorite scenes?  Well, everyone seems to love the cows floating in the air, so I won't pick that one.  I really liked the part where the twister ripped through the outside movie theater, tearing the big screen to shreds as the people quickly ran away to try and get away from it.  That's just one of MANY awesome scenes.The storyline is really good too.  It's not just a story about a divorce between Helen and her husband.  There's a lot more to it than that.  It's complicated because the new girlfriend of the husband shows up and gets involved in all sorts of tornado action (against her will).This is such an awesome movie.  I highly recommend it.  Tornado movies don't GET any better than this.  Pure action from beginning to end.  You will be glued to your television screen hoping the tornado chasers manage to escape the devastating danger.  Twister will make you think twice if you're thinking about becoming a tornado chaser.",N/A

Back then, it was simply a matter of speculation; now, just over a short thirty years later, humans have ""advanced"" scientifically more than anticipated, and the likelihood of such a scenario occuring is much greater.

238240,"This is on my all time favorite list.  It's one of the most majestic, moving epics ever made.  And considering Leone hadn't directed a film in 12 years makes it all the more remarkable.  Everything in this film comes together so well.  Performances, direction, and Ennio Morricone's music is the most moving score he ever did for Leone.  Morricone had actually composed the music for the film way back in 1976 (!).  It just took Leone a long time to obtain funding and to secure the rights for the film (it's based on a novel called The Hoods by Harry Grey).  Morricone and Leone had probably the most unique collaboration in the history of cinema.  It's a shame Morricone (and Leone) never won Academy awards.  As people probably already know, this DVD edition is Leone's cut, the 229 minute version that played all across Europe (where it was immediately hailed as a masterpiece).  Thankfully, the 139 minute butchered version is nowhere to be found.  It was out on VHS briefly in the 1980's (along with the long version), and has never appeared again on home video.  Critics, for once, helped this film get noticed.  They trashed the short version, rightfully calling it a travesty.  Then Warner Brothers released the uncut version to arthouse theaters, and the film was recognised as a classic.  The film is like an epic novel, unfolding slowly, layer by layer, until the sad, melancholy ending.  Some have said that the whole film is an ""opium"" dream of Noodles (De Niro's character), but I personally don't agree.  But that's up for debate.  A great work of art like this inspires debate.  Leone died 6 years after this film (he was only 60), but he is as great an artist as Tarkovsky, Dreyer, Herzog, Ford, Fellini, etc., etc..  No one made films like he did, and no one has ever captured his style and substance.  You see homages constantly to his work, but Leone's films have a depth to them that most people miss.  This is his deepest work, a film that will last forever...",N/A
373207,"A a Heinlein fan, I was so disgusted when Starship Troopers came out since it had almost nothing in common with the book but the name and the most basic of premises. But then along came the Puppet Masters and I was pretty happy with this really great movie despite a few cosmetic changes to make the movie doable without a huge budget; while flying cars might have been kind of cool, not having them didn't make a difference to the spirit of the movie or the book. Nor did I miss seeing a lot of people running around near-naked like in the book.While the movie is not 100 per cent true to the book, it's still a very good adaptation and any fan of the book would enjoy it nonetheless. My only gripe is with the DVD itself: I had seen this movie on Showtime, and not in the restrictive widescreen format that the DVD has. While this may be great for very large screen TVs, the letter-box format doesn't work for me at all and we consummers should be given the choice to buy wide screen or full screen versions.And, then too, there are no other special features which would have been nice. So those few matters force me to give this DVD only four stars instead of the five it deserves but it's still pretty good.",Puppet Masters VHS

571748,"The first time I saw this movie (can't believe it was over six years ago), I wrote that Nurse Betty was delightful -- not the movie, but the character.  It's too bad Renee changed too much since her naivete in this silly film within a film.  Lots of things have changed in six or seven years -- I know I have, that's for sure.  When I found this tape, I was shocked, thinking either I have changed or watching it in a theater added a bit of magic lacking on the tape.  Nobody is that un-sophisticated.  Perhaps her ""unknowing"" character was the story (may be every girl's fantasy) takes her on a journey into the world of soap operas.  She was too sweet to be true.  We don't all get what we wish for; this is a modern fairytale like 'Born Yesterday.'Here, now, is Wink's ""A Reason to Love.""  He must have found this same tape in April out there when he accused another Betty of creating a soap opera.  Chuck is no Greg Kinnear.  All Bettys are not so dumb as to travel to California while in a dream state caused by Post Traumatic Stress Syndrome.  She becomes the character and fascinates Dr. David as she dresses like a nurse and successfully lands a job in a real hospital.Betty was damaged emotionally by the sight of her real-life, abusive husband after he was savagely murdered.  Suddenly, she's free to be herself and spend some time in fairy land out in Los Angeles.  They found her charming and relentless, but she is not a Southerner.  After a foray into a world she does not understand, she lost her spontenanity and is devastated when her idol proves to be less than a god -- when he calls her crazy or deranged.  Later, he changes his mind.  Greg Kinnear is as handsome in this role as our George Clooney, only better.  She had told him ""If you were any handsomer, it'd be a crime; it's too bad you're such an -------.""He inadvertendly sends Del's killers to her before she can safely get away in the car which has their drugs in the trunk.

This is a wonderfully quirky movie about following your dreams and how one 60+ year old guy did that to set some world speed records on top of a 40 year old deathtrap of a machine. It is based on a true story of a New Zealander who did just that.  Although I might have made the movie a few minutes slower, it is a wonderful film, and one the whole family can enjoy.  It is moving, funny, inspiring and warm.  Hopkins is wonderful in this role and shows again the range of his acting talents.  Hannibel Lecter is nowhere to be found in this movie.  Even if you don't know an Indian from a Ducati, you will find yourself rooting for the nifty old guy as he sets out to follow his dreams.  The movie really is a reminder to all of us that it is never to late to follow our dreams.

967146,"Yes, I confess if I had to choose I'd pick Bewitched as my favourite of the two shows. I was never really sure who had copied who, since they were filmed around the same time, but I got a lot of pleasure and laughs from both these wonderful shows growing up in the 70's and have continued to enjoy the re-runs over the years. Inevitably, these two fantasy style comedies are going to be pitted up against each other and compared. Who is the cuter blonde lead? Which character correlates with which? Although Major Nelson (Larry Hagman), is a much dishier master of the house, hands down; hard to believe he was the same actor who played the evil 'J.R' in Dallas. Regardless of these comparisons, ultimately I think they are two quality shows in their own right with great slapstick comedy, performances, writing and production. Though Bewitched did have the greater depth and overall class of the two, 'Jeannie' was equally funny and with often more hilarious physical comedy, especially from Hagman.Babara Eden is such a beautiful woman. She has a touch of the exotic about her face and voice, mixed with the pretty blonde all American look, that is very suited to the role. It is very difficult and ultimately pointless to pick between her and 'Samantha'(Elizabeth Montgomery), because they each have their own style and character. Samatha though, is the more wholesome of the two. I read somewhere that there was some controversy back then about 'Jeannie' being allowed to display her (quite ample) cleavage but not her belly button. The latter would have been more authentic, though maybe not as tasteful to viewers then.Major Healy is a fun side kick and pal to Major Nelson, and poor old Dr Bellows (who I think correlates more to 'Mrs Kravitz' in Bewitched than 'Endora' as was mentioned by one reviewer), can never catch a break. His constant and seemingly imagined, witnessing of Major Nelson's strange activites, is made even more amusingly ironic by the fact that he's a Psychiatrist.What is also most amusing about the show is the way it turns around and pokes fun at the concept of the male master being in command of his supposed 'female slave'. Who is really in charge of who? Major Nelson thinks he is living every male fantasy by catching his very own sexy looking female version of 'Aladin's Genie', in a bottle; who promises to make his every wish come true. But it is she who always ends up having the last laugh! A Cute battle of the sexes in a way, and a light 60's comedy not to be taken seriously, just enjoyed.",N/A

109215,"Boy, here's one re-make I thought was far superior to the original (""Dial M For Murder,"" with Ray Milland, Grace Kelly and Bob Cummings.) In this film, the stars are Michael Douglas, Gwyneth Paltrow and Viggo Mortensen.The best part of this film may not be the story, or the acting, both of which keep you glued to the screen, but the stylish photography and sets..  They look magnificent, mainly the apartment of the the two leads. I was constantly awed by how good this film looks. The DVD transfer is beautiful.I also prefer the sequel because it has more twists and is complex enough to thoroughly enjoy every 3-4 years. Also fun are the short speeches each character gives on occasion, usually when they smugly think they have the upper hand. Each time that happens, their antagonist winds up going one up on them! There isn't much action in here but when it occurs, it's very intense.The only thing that annoys me - unfortunately it's a big one - is the ending in which I don't believe justice totally prevailed. I can't wrote much more without spoiling it for those who have not seen this. One of the parties comes out looking like a 'an innocent victim"" and that person was hardly a ""saint.""

It takes a look at the workplace from a woman's view.We first meet Violet (Lily Tomlin) who has been working for Consolidated Companies for 12 years and has been overlooked for most of them.  She trained her current boss and has the bruises to prove it.  Judy (Jane Fonda) is the new girl in the office.  She is a divorcee (he left her for his secretary) and has never worked for a living.  Rounding out the heroines is Doralee (Dolly Parton in the film debut). She is the personal secretary of Franklin Hart (Dabney Coleman) and everyone thinks she is ""banging the boss"".But the fun starts when Violet is passed over for a promotion to a man she helped train.  She then blurts out that Hart has been spreading rumors that he's been having an affair with Doralee.  And an employee is fired for a small infraction. This sends the three women to the local bar to drown their sorrows and they bond.Each comes up with their fantasy way of killing the boss.  Judy is a big game hunter with Hart as the prey.  Doralee plays role reversal and Hart ends up on a rotisserie spit.  But Violet wants it to be like a fairy tale where she is Snow White and the wicked witch and poisons Hart.The next day, Violet accidentally poisons Hart's coffee.  When falls out of his chair and is knock unconscious, Violet thinks she killed him.  This leads to an all out comedy chase with Violet steals the wrong corpse.The next day to the ladies surprise, Hart shows up.  The ladies regroup in the restroom but Roz overhears them and reports it to Hart.  Hart confronts the ladies but they wind up kidnapping him to find some incriminating evidence.  The find something but it is going to take some time to get the evidence.  Over the next six weeks the ladies run the office in Hart's absence.  Hart escapes but the ladies changes have brought notice and Hart is not above taking someone else's glory.The subject matter here is very serious.  So to do it as a comedy is very daring and it works perfectly.  This is a film that many people identify with.  Everyone has had a boss or a teacher that oppressed them.

In the early 70's, wheh these series started, these films were not just entertainment but important social commentary. Both series had 5 installments and were immensely popular with the public.The original Death Wish is a masterpiece. Bronson plays his most famous role here, the liberal Paul Kersey. He becomes a reluctant vigilante and hero after his wife is murdered by thugs.The transformation from liberal to vigilante is not overnight and Bronson excels is showing the gradual changes. The entire cast is great and special mention goes to the Star Charles Bronson in his signature role, Stuart Margolin as a Arizona gun enthusiast, and Vincent Gardenia, who is absolutely perfect as the NY cop in charge of the vigilante investigation.The fact that neither Bronson, Gardenia, or Margolin received Oscar nominations is a disgrace. The message of this film is a ""get tough on crime"" conservative message and it is well documented that Hollywood favors the liberal movies.

355273,"The mini-series ""Shaka Zulu"" is a compelling story about one of Africa's (and indeed the world) greatest military strategists and king of the Zulu nation, Shaka.Shaka's military genius can be illustrated by the fact that he was very familiar and employed most of the principles of war that modern senior officers learn at staff colleges around the world. Fighting a war involves careful planning and consideration. The Principles of War were used successfully by Shaka as important tools toward achieving success in war. The application of the 9 principles of war by Shaka can be illustrated below:Clear Objectives:  All his military operations were directed towards a defined, decisive, and attainable objective (except at the end when the British exploited successfully their superior weapons technology).Offensive:  Shaka knew the importance of seizing, retaining, and exploiting the initiative. He achieved success by aggressively moving forward, catching the enemy off-guard to force them to surrender or terminate their resistance.Mass: Shaka's army used the concept of, ""Shock and awe"" of concentrating overwhelming combat power at the decisive place and time shocking his enemies into submission.Economy of Force: Shaka used to focus the right amount of force at the right time at the right location.Manoeuvre: Shaka would place the enemy in a position of disadvantage through the flexible application of combat power.Unity of Command:  For every objective, there was one person responsible for war fighting decisions, the great elephant himself (Shaka).Security: Shaka did not permit the enemy to acquire an unexpected advantage except that due to superior technology, the British ultimately triumphed over himSurprise: Shaka's wars were short, with few lives lost (on his side), and he largely achieved this through the application of the principle of surprise. Shaka would destroy his enemy's will to fight and do it as quickly as possible.Simplicity: Shaka prepared clear, uncomplicated plans and clear, concise orders to ensure thorough understanding. Winning his numerous wars did not depend on his Generals alone, but on the initiative, bravery, and courage of those on the front-line.",Shaka Zulu VHS

231179,"The varied reactions to this movie by other reviewers are interesting, but nonetheless surprise me. De gustibus and all that, I suppose.Released in 1987 but set in 1957, this is a well written and well acted drama with much of the feel of 40s and 50s noir. The look of the film, presumably deliberately, also has the style of an earlier era. The sound track, with Ivory Joe Hunter, Lincoln Chase, Big Joe Turner and others, couldn't be more suitable. The sleaze, of course, is much more advanced than would have been permissible thirty years earlier.The hero, J.C. Cullen (Matt Dillon), is more complex than a pure country innocent corrupted by a wicked woman Lorry Dane (Diane Lane), a stripper at the Gem Club. A small town gambler trying to make it big in Chicago, he has his own dark, or at least not-so-light, side, which is why he takes up with Lorry so readily. Yet, he at least struggles with his conscience even if he doesn't always do the right thing. Tommy Lee Jones and Bruce Dern are in fine form as villains, Lee Grant has just the right touch, and Diane Lane has never been more stunning or more credible in a role. The Big Town is not a big movie, but it is a good one.",N/A
183337,"This is one of those rare works that doesn't go for simple, heavy handed storytelling. It's a tragedy that unfolds at a realistic pace, with characters trying desperately to be human in the face of a world that has lost its sympathy and sanity.It follows the tale of two children, one a clueless 4-5 year-old, and the other a young man summoning all his courage to take care of her and prevent her from being traumatized after their mother is killed in the bombings of Japan at the end of WWII.Some call this film anti-war, and I think it does portray that every side of war is wrong by essentially just asking to hurt the innocent people as these two inevitably end up being. There's no forcing of the message though, and certainly no politics at all. It shows life, and doesn't preach anything at all.Truly a great film, although I will add that you may not always be thrilled to put up with the younger child well... acting like a fussy child that young. However, it's not fake, it's just the way children are, and makes you appreciate the character of her older brother all the more.",N/A

1006619,"From the moment LEGENDS OF HORROR was announced I was looking forward to it with great expectation but I already had a few qualms regarding it. As has been well covered elsewhere Boris Karloff's THE WALKING DEAD from 1936 should have been included in the set but I can live with THE RETURN OF DOCTOR X for a few reasons. 1) It does offer Humphrey Bogart the opportunity to show what a good actor can do with what for him was a thankless role. 2) The director Vincent Sherman was still alive to provide commentary on the making of the film as well as background on Bogie and others. 3) Most important of all it shows how censorship imposed on the movies in 1934 changed the style and content of the first great cycle of horror films.The way the films are coupled is another issue. I understand the reasons for coupling Karloff and Lugosi together from a marketing standpoint but thematically MARK OF THE VAMPIRE should have been coupled with THE DEVIL DOLL as both are Tod Browning films which were heavily cut by MGM reflecting the aftermath of the FREAKS debacle. THE MASK OF FU MANCHU and MAD LOVE would have fit together nicely as portraits of over the top manaical mad doctors which are beautifully photographed with fascinating art direction.Finally there are the commentaries themselves. I have already talked about Vincent Sherman on RETURN OF DOCTOR X as being of historical interest. The other commentaries are a mixed bag. Greg Mank's one for THE MASK OF FU MANCHU is a prime example of how it should be done. He is obviously watching the film as he narrates telling us what to look and listen for which greatly enhances the viewing experience. On the other hand Kim Newman's and Steve Jones' commentary on MARK OF THE VAMPIRE, while demonstrating that they know their stuff, comes across as very distracting as they don't coordinate what they are saying with what is going on during the film. And why is there no commentary for THE DEVIL DOLL? It was Tod Browning's last great film and has a colorful history of its own (it's a curious combination of Browning's THE UNHOLY THREE and THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO).Nevertheless this is a first rate set of rarely seen 1930's horror films done the way it should be that no early horror fan should be without. It is attractively packaged and features great transfers for the most part (the color print of DOCTOR X looks as good as can be expected). It's also a joy to have the 6 minutes of censored footage restored to THE MASK OF FU MANCHU in all of its politically incorrect glory. Now Warners should get to work on Volume 2 with the same sort of packaging. It could include THE WALKING DEAD, MYSTERY OF THE WAX MUSEUM, KONGO (or better yet a restored version of WEST OF ZANZIBAR), FREAKS, and a double feature of John Barrymore's SVENGALI and THE MAD GENIUS.",Hollywood's Legends of Horror Collection: (Doctor X / The Return of Doctor X / Mad Love / The Devil Doll / Mark of the Vampire / The Mask of Fu Manchu)

633574,"Those famous words by Bob Dylan say a lot about the love in this movie. The characters here, especially the adults, are damaged, unable to cope with major disappointments and challenges in their lives. Denny Davies, Costner, once had it all. A star pitcher for a pro ball team, he is now reduced to talking sports on the radio and selling autographs, two lonely occupations that give him no pleasure. Terry Wolfmeyer, rich and mother of four lovely girls, has been abandoned by her husband. Both have descended into a state of perpetual inebriation, never severe enough to be life threatening, always severe enough to keep real emotions and maturity away. They bump together not because of love's strong magnetism, but rather, because unanchored boats in a harbor eventually must bump into each other during storms.The great strength of the movie is that these people are not attractive, they're whiny, cynical, self-pitying, narcissistic drunks. They hang together out of convenience and desperation, in time, some sort of affection develops. But Terry has to push Denny pretty hard before he can relocate the confidence and focus he must have had on the mound, and demand something real. It's a defining moment in the film, a moment when Terry and Denny realize the four daughters are far more mature than they are. In case you don't know the movie's surprise ending I will only say that in the final analysis it only cements what should have been pretty obvious already.  That is, both these people were extremely blessed and their wallowing, while understandable, is best viewed as a necessary stage of grieving and not a lifestyle.A point of clarification about the leads. Joan Allen is one of our best actresses, incapable of delivering anything less than a stellar performance. Mr. Costner, by contrast, earned this role I'm happy to say. It was not always thus. Before there was a Brad Pitt, before there was a Tom Cruise, the handsome young idiot devoid of acting talent women adored was Kevin Costner. The young Costner was so stiff on camera that blocks of wood actually complained that he was giving them a bad name. (For a great example, sample his performance in The Untouchables, you would bet he was holding his script.) Because of his completely undeserved success Costner was allowed to stick around and make more movies. In the process, he improved a good bit. In TUOA we see how much.Costner is loose in this role, rumpled, casual, messed up. Just right. When he does show passion, it's believable. That's a pleasure. To see Costner holding his own with an actress of Joan Allen's stature, and actually creating a meaningful synthesis that causes us to care, is an accomplishment. This is a smart, beautifully made movie worth watching.",Upside of Anger (DVD) (WS)
335755,I agree with another reviewer that they could have explored the main theme of this movie more which is this ancient skeleton that is the embodiment of evil I guess.Cushing believes that evil is a disease so he takes a blood sample from the skeleton to create a vaccine that he thinks will cure people from being evil.I guess he feels there's something wrong with his daughter so he injects her with his new formula.  But perhaps the only thing wrong with her was he kept her locked up in the house for her entire adult life.That's when things get sad.Somehow she inexplicably becomes possessed with the spirit of her dead mother who went insane.She goes to a brothel and gets taken advantage of and finally slashes this guy's throat with a broken bottle.Maybe I just took the whole thing too seriously.Another reviewer also mentioned the strange painting that Cushing is working on at the beginning of the movie.  I guess the painting sort of encapsulates the entire movie.One good thing is apparently back then most of the women in London had gigantic breasts and they kept falling out of their dresses in the pubs.I would recommend this movie to horror fans because it's got horror legends Peter Cushing and Christopher Lee.Jeff MarzanoRecommended further viewing:Brides Of Blood / Beast Of BloodHorror HotelIT !

858452,"This has to be one of the coolest animes ever made. With the Director of Cowboy Beebop, the creators of the series have turned history on its head, as we join Mugen, Jin, and Fuu on their road trip in Meji-period Japan. Mugen, with his rough and ready back street fighting skills, and Jin, with his uncompromising elegant swordsmanship, help the young waitress in her journey to find the ""Samurai who smells of sunflowers"" in return for her saving them from execution, while also trying to find enough food to eat along the way.The most impressive aspect of this series as a whole is in its ability to change from heart-breaking storylines to extremely funny episodes. This anime shows us a totally different historical Japan, one that has the walking dead, baseball, and nude paintings. However, it grounds itself by also showing us the emotional background stories of the characters and the people they meet along the way. You really never ever know what to expect from one episode to the next, so the series is always fresh and never gets boring.The animation is very good and the creators have put a lot of effort to ensure their characters have detailed facial expressions. The voice acting is spot-on, with Mugen's attitude coming across brilliantly and the music is good. I love the song on the ending credits, however, the opening hip-hop tune takes a bit of getting used to.

852762,"The images of evil in this film are unforgettable because of the way they sneak through the ambiguity of compartmented virtue. The movie rates five stars just for the way Hitler's mask of steady fatherly leadership in the bunker erodes into tirades of invective for his subordinates and the German people. His moral veneer reflecting a kindly, dog-loving, vegitarian steward of the Reich gives way to a misanthropic rage. The film illustrates well that Hitler was a pathological incompetent whose appeal to the German mob fed on their bigotry and ignorance as well as on jingoism. But Hitler's megalomaniacal personna is only one aspect of this amazing production. From Magda Goebbels's ineffable cruelty in murdering her children to the routine use of brainwashed kids to resist the tide of the Soviet advance, this film captures the possibility of moral chaos lurking just beneath the manicured surface of a civilization. If anything this film is an affirmation that there is an absolute difference between right and wrong and that there is no substitute for education in making a sane society. We know there are moral shades of gray in the middle, but ignorance should not let that gray confuse us.",Der Untergang
990688,"'She's the Man' released in '06 is an enjoyable though predictable tale of a talented teenage soccer player named Viola (Amanda Bynes) who also happens to be an attractive girl attending a high school that just disbanded its girl's soccer team. When the soccer coach refuses to give her a tryout with the boy's squad she devises a plan to take her twin brothers place at another local school and pretend to be a male. Of course the usual love interests and emotional complications develop along the way and jeporadize her role-playing act and percarious position on the boy's team.Nothing new here, it's a movie you've seen many times in one form or another. However the cast is attractive and the acting is better than you might expect. Channing Tatum does a great job as Duke, Viola's love interest as does Laura Ramsey as Olivia. However the real strength of the film is the lovely and talented Amanda Bynes. If you're an Amanda fan like I am you'll love it. If not you'll probably like it anyway.",N/A

265171,"I remember seeing the ""Special Edition"" of A New Hope in the theaters nearly a decade ago. While I was blown away with seeing a Star Wars film on the big screen, much of the ""special"" material left me with mixed emotions. Then came the rest of the films and by the time I got to the musical scene in Jabba's Palace I was simply depressed. Then came episodes I-III and I slowly began to stop caring at all.The last and only version of Star Wars I bought (and still own) was the VHS boxed set of the original films. So, while I can understand the rage of everyone who has bought a half-dozen versions of these films in the last ten years, I haven't fallen into that particular money pit. I simply preferred to do without the films if they had to be the special editions. I stuck to my dusty VHS tapes.Lucas is clearly out to make as much money as possible from the franchise. That was obvious to me from the moment I left the theater after Episode I. So, I've patiently waited for the originals, flaws and all, to make their way back on the shelves. Now they have and I'll probably pick them up. Though, I can assure you it's only for the ""bonus features"" (i.e. the theatrical releases). The fact that it's weighted down with the ""Special Editions"" and the damage is done to my psyche, those VHS tapes are getting pretty fragile.I'll take the bitter with the sweet.","Star Wars - Episode IV, A New Hope VHS"

790132,"For me, ""The Elegant Universe"" is the book that started it all. Then came the video with its vivid graphics and a more expansive look at the future of strings theory, and the concept lept from the page and into my living room.Greene has an astoundingly smooth manner of easing the novice into the complexities of string theory, the reader feels almost acquainted by the time the science is introduced. Never boring or tedious, Greene deftly guides us through the basics of relativity, explains the importance of frames of reference, and eases us into the almost magical world of gravity and timespace.Like Einstein, Greene presents the science through simple visuals - balls and bicycles, donuts, slices of toast and wormhole traveling cabs. The reader will never feel as though he sits in a classroom with a boring professor droning away the afternoon. Instead, Greene describes the physics in a real world way and in doing so, prepares even the most casual student for the truly strange world of strings. It was that way in printed form and the video brings it to a new level. Rather than repeat the lessons from the book, ""The Elegant Universe"" on DVD only enhances the malleability the science.String theory appears to be the road to a unified theory, the long sought Theory of Everything that will unite relativity and quantum mechanics. Along the way is a wonderous world of possibilities, with extra dimensions, parallel worlds, and all the while, tiny strings vibrating the symphony of the universe.I read this book with a zeal normally reserved for action novels. Each night was a new lesson and a new glimpse at a different part of the universe. Greene's gift is a clear and friendly writing style that makes this heavy science accessible to those of us without a string of initials at the end of our name.Many physicists came before Greene and others have followed suit. But for me, ""The Elegant Universe"" is what opened my eyes to the mind blowing world of strings and the possibilities they present. And I've been hooked on string theory since. I recommend this video to anyone who has thought to read the book but never felt up to it. Both are recommended to anyone who had ever looked at a sky full of stars and wondered what it's all about.",N/A

561250,"ANOTHER VIEW OF MICHAEL CHANCE- CAN YOU BELIEVE IT???!!!!I recently purchased this DVD and watched it last evening and I'm still reacting to it in a very positive way! It was a glorious mixture of art and dance and singing and comedy.Based on an incident in Shakespeare's 'A Midsummer Night's Dream,it is held together with some of the most inspired and beautiful arias penned for the English language.  At first one attempts to be logical and follow the ""story"" which is really not obvious or important. It consists of 9 Masques portraying various scenarios interwoven with the beautiful songs of Purcell  sung with much skill and enthusiasm by the chorus as well as the many soloists.I was delighted by Michael Chance's intermittent roles which fortunately included his uniquely lovely voice. The duet at the beginning of part two featuring Chance (Mopsa) and Jonathan Best (the drunken poet) is absolutely priceless humour. Having followed Chance's career for 20 years I was amazed to see him in a comedy role, and I liked it!Thomas Randle in the role of Oberon was memorable in his singing as well as his facility to move with grace and ease. Yvonne Kenny as the tyranical Titania was marvelously domineering over a somewhat 'hen-pecked'Oberon.  Puck (played by Simon Rice)was very convincing  as the chief mischief maker.I think the entire Opera is great!!!! BUT do not expect to enjoy it unless you have a well-developed sense of humor; for it is tongue-in-cheek humour that is reflected in the scenery, the costuming; even the dance itself; and the music of Purcell suits it very well.The entire production brings alive the splendour of the Baroque for a modern audience.",Purcell - The Fairy Queen / English National Opera

Still, even in a work this short, there are depths that can't really be explored in a 2-hour movie, so if you liked the movie, I would strongly recommend you read the book.But I did enjoy the movie. I don't know if it's a great movie or not, but I found it oddly engrossing and with a very poignant ending. Of course, any movie with Anthony Hopkins in it is a plus, but I think the other brothers and actors did a fine job with their roles too, including Brad Pitt.In the book, Harrison has a direct but poetic style, and his male characters are well-drawn and believable. The women don't have much of a role in his books, but I don't mind that really. Harrison is a writer about old-fashioned masculine virtues and ideals of the sort that perhaps don't exist in our society anymore.

362303,"John Wayne stars as Hondo Lane, a half-Indian message carrier and gunslinger in New Mexico. He first shows up at the ranch of Mrs. Angie Lowe after getting away from Apache attackers. This takes place in the ending days of the ""Indian round-up"" years, when only a few bands of Apache were left. Hondo takes a liking to Angie and her young son, but soon heads out to deliver the message.In the meantime, the Apache have always been fond of Mrs. Lowe and had a good relationship with her - and the chief takes a personal interest in her son. He tries to convince Angie to choose a new husband from amongst his braves. She insists that her husband will be back soon to stay on the remote ranch with her.Hondo runs into the wayward husband in a bar, only learning his name after punching him out. In an attempt to get the husband back to his wife, Hondo takes the man's horse and says that Mr. Lowe can retrieve it at the ranch. Angry, Lowe pays a guy to go with him after Hondo. Apaches attack and kill the paid bodyguard, and Hondo shoots an Apache to save Lowe's life. Lowe repays Hondo by attempting to shoot him in the back. Hondo is forced to kill him. He takes Lowe's tintype of Lowe's son to bring back to the mom.Along the way, the Apaches find Hondo and are about to torture him to death when the Apache chief recognizes the tintype. Hondo still has to fight - and triumph over - the brother of the Apache he killed. The Apache chief brings Hondo back to Mrs. Lowe, who claims Hondo as her husband in order to get him in away from the Apaches. Hondo tries several times to tell Angie what happened, but each time she doesn't want to hear it. She does end up hearing the truth from someone else, but when Hondo then attempts to tell the boy, Angie refuses to let him do it. She scolds Hondo that his need for the truth is so great that he'd damage the boy's sense of well being and security to achieve it.The movie is a rather complex story, based almost exactly on the story by Louis L'Amour. John Wayne loved the story so much that he specifically hired a favorite script writer to adapt it into a movie for him. It was filmed to be watched in 3D, so there are several scenes with knives poking at the screen and people standing in the foreground. You might think this would make the movie look cheesy, but really you're normally lost in the storyline or the gorgeous landscapes.This movie came out in 1953 and for an era that saw many ""slaughter the Indians"" movies, it's pretty impressive in its even handedness. Angie likes the Apaches and has been friends with them since childhood. Hondo is a half Indian, and had an Apache wife while he lived with them for 5 years. You get treated to many scenes with Apaches speaking in their native Apache tongue. Hondo makes it pretty clear that the only reason that the Apache are rising up are that the US government has been actively deceiving them and betraying them. He explains that the Apache are very much against lying, and that he is the same way.Compared to many other westerns, this does a reasonably good job of showing shades of grey, not just 'Good' and 'Bad'. The Apaches were pushed into the war, but they're prepared to kill an innocent woman who has lived on this land from birth. The settlers are sometimes obnoxious about their desire to get rid of the ""natives"". In the end, Hondo says that he imagines this will be the end of the Apache way of life, and that it's a shame.",Hondo VHS

The concerts are ""One Night Stand,"" ""Revelations,"" and ""Relentless,"" and, when Hick's at his best, they're apt descriptions of his effect.  The targets include the religious right, Republicans, and, by his standards, various and sundry other moral hypocrites.  The style is aggression bordering on passion.  Hicks has his loyal fans - Goat Children - but I was like an agnostic at a revival meeting.  Rather than salvation through laughter I found Hicks more thought provoking that rib tickling.  At least the first time through.The big problem is that there's a lot of repeat material in all three concerts.  Hicks, who died in 1994, recorded all three in the early nineties, and I guess some repetition can be expected and forgiven.  It gets a little leaden when you watch them back to back to back, though.The second problem concerns the documentary.  Unforgivably they tell you when Hicks died but not the cause of death (pancreatic cancer.)  As you've probably read in the product description the documentary includes Brett Butler, Jay Leno, and David Letterman, among others.  The second sin committed by the documentary is allowing David Letterman to express his personal regret about the Hicks's last appearance on his late night show, which was censored, without explaining why or what material was cut. If a `net search is correct it had to do with something Hicks said that offended pro-lifers. In all, a pleasantly amusing three hours, lots of repeats, and not enough to send me shopping for Bill Hicks concert cds anytime soon.","Bill Hicks Live - Satirist, Social Critic, Stand-Up Comedian"

Overall he's a solid, unflappable fellow, but when he hears international columnist Tess Harding (Katherine Hepburn) support the abolition of baseball during wartime, he can't resist retaliating in print. The battle is soon joined, and it's not long before the editor calls them together for a cease-fire. One look at Tess, though, and Sam is a goner. Their mutual attraction can't be denied, and it's not long before they're married.But what is Sam in for? Tess' career has a life of its own, and he can barely get a moment with her alone. Most of the time, he's trailing in her wake along with countless diplomats, refugees and other international figures. While Sam is successful at his work, it's a world Tess has little time for - and it's not long before the relationship feels the strain.""Woman of the Year"" happily manages to avoid many of the pitfalls inherent in stories focused on sexual politics. While Tess' career is not endorsed as inherently fulfilling, typical gender roles aren't offered as the solution (however much Tess would like to believe they are). Indeed, the film asks for compromise and balance from its characters - in fact, no clear solution is reached by the film's end. It's up to the viewer to hope that they'll find one.One of the film's delights is that's precisely what you do wish. It's easy to see from their debut why Hepburn and Tracy went on to become one of cinema's most indelible teams, making eight more films together. Their deep mutual affection for one another (on and off the set) lights up the screen.

Castle Keep starts off with a sense of ""Look out, folks, this is uncommon rabbit hole.""  And it is.  But this isn't an ordinary WWII war movie as the narrator of the movies starts: ""Eight walking wounded chanced upon a castle...""  Its premise is uncommon: its art and history vs. theory and practice.  Who will be the victor?  Can there be a victory?  Almost immediately I'm reminded of the bombing of Dresden.  Does that metaphor carry any weight in the film?  Whether it does or not it's still a weighty film.  It's a film about misfits, about baker's dozen and The Lost Boys.  About make-shift prophets and a buffalo riding on a horse. It's about catching your breath and the Red Queen's whores.  For these weary soldiers they suddenly find themselves in a world of shell shock and storybook fantasy.  But the business of killing persists.  With the Germen reaching and breaching the walls of Castle Keep it's every man and connoisseur for himself.  It's a battle that every players of this movie can't afford to lose regardless of the outcome, of motive.  Above all one of the soldiers is a writer.

394749,"Made for almost nothing, Whit Stillman's lovely first film from 1990 demonstrates that the pleasures of film can lie in dialogue as well as in images in motion. Tom Townsend, a cynical Princetonian from the West Side, is persuaded to invest in renting a tux by a set of more privileged peers who want him to accompany them to debutante balls at glamorous faded hotels like the Plaza and the St. Regis, and then hang out until all hours in their deluxe East Side apartments afterwards. The film cuts costs as ingeniously as Tom by filming most of its scenes in these swanky living rooms (one of which was owned by the parents of one of the young actors). The film depicts a basically Fitzgeraldean vision of the young and wealthy, with the boys mostly romantic cynics and all the young women (except the idealized Audrey, the shy heroine who falls in love with Tom) more pragmatic and sexually adventurous. But Stillman's feel for this world seems very real, and his dialogue is very sprakiling and literate (the intellectual sources the young people cite--Fourier and Trilling--are charmingly anachronistic). The cast is excellent, although the standouts are Chris Eigemann, as the funny and trenchant Nick, and the gifted Carolyn Farina, who makes the timid Audrey seem deeply endearing.",Metropolitan VHS
856436,"If you haven't seen one episode of the 4400, you really need to start watching. I just got into it recently and now just decided to watch it from the beginning. The 3rd season isn't bad but I really missed some great tv by not watching it from the start. 4400 people disapear and reapear after a big ball of light appears in the sky. They all come back to their lives being different, their loved ones are either dead, moved on or just treat them differently. So they have to find their place in the world. On top of that they slowly realize that they have new abilities.Two agents, must work together to find out the secrets of the 4400. One Tom Baldwin volunteers to be on the case because he knows it will lead him to find out why his son is in a mysterious coma. While his nephew Shawn disapeared the same night his son was put in a coma. Now he's back and part of the 4400. Shawn soon finds that he can heal people and also finds that his brother's g/f  has a crush on him. As if his brother doesn't treat him strange after his reapearance already.While Conchita Campbell is adorable yet creepy as a child 4400 that was missing the longest. She can tell the future and even knows that things won't last very long with her new foster parents. Especially when she tells the husband what cemetary he'll be buried in. Bill Campbell (The Rocketeer, Enough) plays a rich and powerful man that decides to be the voice of the 4400 claiming that he too is one. He influences the others to realize that they are important and should embrace their new powers.Their was so many new sci-fi shows last season like Invasion and Surface and I thought they were trying to be like Lost but really they were trying to be like the 4400. Now NBC has Heroes coming out with people all over the world finding out that they have powers. Sound original ? Plus I doubt that will be as good or as fascinating as this. It's about as good as Lost, maybe even better and if you're not watching it you really should start.",The 4400 - The Complete First Season
88682,"Okay, there's ONE movie made that scared me so bad when I was a kid, that I couldn't sleep.  this is it, and I didn't even see the re-released version that they added all the ""too much"" stuff back in until years later.  Being raised Catholic, hell and the devil are the worst things you can face and already haunt your dreams.  This movie embodied everything that was drilled into you during Sunday sermons, so when I saw this film....Ho-leeee-crap! Every night I waited for my bed to start shaking because I wasn't supposed to watch it, and saw it at the midnight movies with older siblings.Of course, I watched it again in my teens and it didn't seem so scary, but was still very unsettling.Then, I saw the re-release a few years back, where they put everything they had to leave out back in and almost soiled my underoos all over again when***Spolier, don't read this part if you haven't seen the film***She creepy-crawled downstairs all twist-turny backwards with the blood pouring out of her mouth.

981334,"I wasn't quite sure what to entirely make of this film. It's undeniable that Sarah Silverman has a very witty, and unrestrained sense of comedy, which I like, but this film could have been outstanding... something was missing. Most of the songs and skits were funny, but some of them were also indulgent, and in my opinion, didn't go anywhere (though, I hadn't laughed that hard in anything in a while when she portrayed a Jewish porn star). I should probably watch it again... I probably would anyway, because most of it was pretty hilarious, but I can't pinpoint exactly what this film was missing. It could have been that I rented this movie not knowing what to expect. Is this a stand up comedy act? Is this a series of skits? Is this a documentary? It ended up being a montage of all 3 of them, which was kind of odd, considering that not many films I have seen really do that. Basically, I think it was my lack of expectations for this movie that rubbed off on me kind of the wrong way. It didn't blow me away, but I got a pretty good amount of laughs and chuckles from viewing this movie. I would recommend this film for anyone who likes her brand of comedy.",Sarah Silverman - Jesus is Magic
1001777,"Silent Hill, Sony Picture's adaptation of the popular videogame series, continues the entertainment industry's introspective exploration of disaffected and disempowered children, masquerading as dispossessed spirits, desperate to redress insidious abuses, sometimes at the expense of a parent's life.The film opens with Rose Da Silva's (Radha Mitchell) gambit to take her daughter, Sharon (Jodelle Ferland) to the enigmatically titled West Virginia town, against the wishes of her husband, Christopher (Sean Bean), in the hope of finding a spiritual cure for Sharon's mysterious illness. Its onslaught has conjured ominous bouts of sleepwalking, delirious repetition of ''Silent Hill,'' disconcerting memory lapses, and brutal artwork, all threatening to have Sharon institutionalized.En route, Rose and Sharon hazard upon an instinctively suspicious police officer, Cybil Bennett (Laurie Holden).  Keen on following the pair into Silent Hill, after a brief encounter in nearby Brahams, the parties are caught off guard by the apparition of a young girl that figures prominently in their separate roadside accidents. Rose ''awakens'' to find Sharon missing. Flustered, she ventures into Silent Hill, on foot, where she believes she has glimpsed her. What she encounters there defies rational explanation. After reuniting with an infuriated Cybil, they navigate a labyrinth of streets and buildings in a dimensionally fractured environment that is enshrouded by powerful metaphysical themes, worthy of some of the best-canvassed creations of the late surrealist, Salvador Dali. Quarantined thirty years ago by Toluca County officials, Silent Hill still smolders as a noxious, ashen hell made more menacing by the shadowy din that periodically transfigures it, heralded by a bellowing siren atop the town's Church. The original coal fire destroyed countless lives-some less innocent than others-and its victims seem to confront Rose and Cybil as badly burnt children, disfigured nurses, contorted corpses, rodent-like insects, and mythical demons--including ""Pyramid Head""--a favorite of the videogamers. Most disturbing perhaps, is Silent Hill's cult of fanatical executioners, bloodthirsty witch hunters, led by beguiling Christabella/Valtiel (Alice Krige, in a role that exceeds the menace of her alter persona as Star Trek's Borg Queen).  More said would spoil the film. Notwithstanding, director Christophe Gans, and writers Nicolas Boukhrief and Robert Avery, execute a superbly crafted, and beautifully cinematographed, film with a brilliant flashback that satisfies nearly all questions about the unfolding mystery.Admittedly, I have never played the Silent Hill videogames. Despite witnessing grown adults shudder at its mention, I suspect the filmmakers' desire to gratify the gaming faithful with violent, if not familiar, imagery did the film more harm than good. The excellent ghost story and score that anchors Silent Hill deserves intellectual play in the disquieted minds of its filmgoers, not in excessively sadistic screen graphics. Gamers will likely disagree with this analysis, and it certainly is not my intention to begrudge them of their joy, but the film's over-reliance on visual mayhem eclipses the truly fine performances of the actors, and truncates constructive narrative and back-story that could have advanced the film's intriguing esoteric, social, psychological, and religious themes. The ""monsters"" and avatars that the protagonists defeat or heed in Silent Hill are metaphors for the less savory in society who impose, or taunt us through, corrosive cultural constraints, institutional obstacles, and personal dilemmas that can corrupt our sense of right and wrong, dissolve the lines between good and evil, and fail our better judgment. Those who are most malevolent threaten the collective good, which has taken the form of a lost and abused little girl in Silent Hill. Falsely accused of the ""sins"" of her mothers, she is to be sacrificed on the altar of heresy. The real fear in the film is the doubt we have in the protagonists' ability to save her, and keep other loved ones safe and alive, away from the fiery precipice.Inspired performances abound. Rahda Mitchell, as the emotionally distraught mother of a terminally ill child, connects with her on screen daughter and husband, and viewers alike. Sean Bean's frustration as an alienated husband, perniciously thwarted by a disingenuous detective, Thomas Gucci--whom actor, Kim Coates, seasons to perfection with small town mindedness--is genuinely believable. Laurie Holden indelibly impresses us as an abrasive, tough motorcycle officer, and Jodelle Ferland, like so many gifted child actors and actresses who have been featured, recently, in sinister tales of possession, raises the bar a notch with a truly mesmerizing interpretation that belies her beauty and innocence.",N/A
790939,"This film by Robert Bresson is beautiful and sad. Made in the same ambience and tone as his 'Au Hazard Bathasar' but not as exciting as it. I don't know where you are coming from, but if you are interested in intimistic and basically plotless cinema, as can be found in foreign (and old) movies, Bresson is a good choice. But if your reason is that of making a spiritual journey, or or widening your faith, then, you must be warned.'Diary...' is pure doubt. The doubt of the main character, the rural priest, and the doubt of the director. The tone and the sadness of the experience of watchibng this film is what mostly impresses me. Other than that, what stays in my mind at the end of the story are the following thoughts:a) The story-teller (Bresson) makes us reflect on the inutily of believing in God, or in acting as if God exists, for if He does exist, life in the present, my circumstance, reality, now, what I feel, the cancer I suffer, the the pain I feel, is so real, so more real than that God of Love I want to believe in but I doubt. This is the impression that this film is communicating me.b) Everybody is cruel. This people don't even deserve my love for them. How can I love them. Why should I be different? It would be crazy. What would my argument be sustained on (the case of the young priest) in order to prove these people wrong in their believes and in their actions? God, his mercy and love? They look at me and they despise me! Or they pity me like a fool!Sad. So this is not really a story, it is just a depiction of a tormented soul, of the realization that we are so imperfect, so weak (would Bresson even say ""sinful""?), a fool-on-the-moon's lament. A cry in the wasteland.What do you do when you are hungry? Do you eat the food, or do you cry at it and blame it for being hungry? Same with God.There is a certain resemblance between this film and the way the great historian Arnold Toynbee depicts disintegrating societies: There is a sense of drift, in which people yield to a meaningless determinism, as if their efforts do not matter, and as if they have no control over their lives. There is a sense of guilt, a self-loathing that comes from their moral abandon.Drift and guilt. These nouns apply as well to the young priest's parishioners. The whole postmodern pandemonium.",N/A

999682,"I'd like to respectfully correct the reviewer who complained that this film is a truncated version of a serial. I'm afraid the reviewer is confusing this film with The Master Mystery, which was Houdini's first film and his only serial. The Master Mystery was released on VHS in the '90s--but even that was not a complete version (which has yet to be discovered).This film, The Man From Beyond, was indeed a feature film and the print on this release is the complete movie (although it is missing the original title card). As to quality...unfortunately, without major restoration, this print is as good gets.As to the film itself...it's a pity this is the only Houdini movie out on DVD, because it is not really one of the better ones. Being the first film Houdini produced himself, it's filled with his obsessions about life after death, etc (he even slips his birthday in here--try to spot it), but it only features one escape. His earlier films, while not being masterpieces, feature many of the escapes that we've come to associate with Houdini.I would love to see Alpha release The Master Mystery (the serial), which is my favorite of all Houdini's movies.",The Man From Beyond
173891,"I'll get the obvious out of the way.... the BBC original series, The Office, is brilliant.  When NBC started promoting an American version of The Office, I cringed.  It seemed flat and unfunny, and I initially refused to watch. I caught a few minutes one week, and I've been hooked since.  It is, surpisingly, quite good.  I didn't want to like the show, but found myself drawn in, much in the same way that I was with the original.Steve Carell is funny, although he does pale in comparison to Ricky Gervais.  He seems like he is trying a little too hard to play the character, and it takes him a few episodes before he seems comfortable in the role.  John Krasinski is not Martin Freeman either, but his ""Jim"" character is quite charming in his own way.  I was a little surprised at his casting at first because I thought he was too much of a ""Ken doll"" to play the Tim/Jim role, but after a few episodes, he grew on me.One of the best things about The Office is that it is a comedy that is actually funny (there are very few on American television, so it's a most welcome addition).  The writing is sharp, witty, and well done.  It does not condescend to it's audience by blasting it with an annoying laugh track.Although it is difficult not to compare the two shows to each other, if you watch NBC's The Office and judge it on it's own merits, the show is entertaining and worth watching.  I'm glad I gave the show another chance.  It isn't necessary to choose between the BBC and American versions of the show.  It's okay to like them both.",N/A

928923,"I am a longtime fan of the Final Fantasy series.  As a kid, I played and beat the very first one they made and have kept track ever since.  It's hard to say exactly why these things fascinate me.  But they do.Of all the reasons I can think of it probably boils down to the fact that when they make these things, it's not just about making a buck on cheap entertainment.  Final Fantasy is something that grips you, both in the way that an excellent book can or a great movie sometimes does.  One, it makes you think and two, you interact with it.  The best ones of all are generally agreed to be: FF4, FF6, FF7, FF10 and the online epic, FF11.  Seven was a turning point in many ways, it was vastly different from the previous versions.  It was the first time they really made an effort to make it less like a game... and more like a truly interactive movie.  Seven changed the entire video game industry forever in the late 90's, just like how Nintendo's The Legend of Zelda changed everything in the 1980's.  One other thing worth mentioning is that FF7 was one of the first games to feature a Black Man (""African American"") in one of the key starring hero roles.  This might have had an influence on the spectacular sales of Seven (featuring a cast with a wide variety of racial backgrounds as they team up to prevent a planet wide crisis).So, the question is, how does non-interactive Final Fantasy measure up?  In this case I can say, pretty darned good.  The CG animation is amazing, particularly in the textured surfaces, like the look they created to simulate woven fabric ... incredible.  The voice acting is a godsend for us American and UK folks - they got it as good to perfect as they possibly could.  They also include a much appreciated recap of Seven's story to bring us up to speed (complete with stirring orchestrated music - prepare for a literal trip down memory lane).  FYI the main antagonist is named Sephiroth he is Cloud's former leader who at the end of Seven tried to become some sort of false divinity (A ""One-Winged Angel"" suggesting his lack of some critical quality that only a real angel would possess).  Oh yeah and some clarification of the whole ""mother"" theme and why the bad guys constantly say it.  It is connected to the planet and the environmental crisis.  The planet is ""mother earth"" a life giving source of energy.  Jenova is the ""mother"" which the bad guys talk about (cells from a Jenova sample were grafted into Sephiroth and others DNA thus they call Jenova their mother) ... an alien lifeform that crashed into their planet in a huge meteor long ago.  Jenova thus rivals and tries to replace the planet as the ""mother"" figure.It's not a cinema classic (yet, it certainly could be a cult classic) but it is a very well thought out, visually stunning motion picture that anyone can watch and enjoy.  The action sequences have a touch of the ""Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon"" syndrome to them (i.e. they fly around a lot), but in a world where magic and materia are the norm, you don't really mind it.  Once again I would like to underscore that the CG graphic animation is mind blowing.  They also got certain characters down absolutely perfect - it was a joy to see old characters like Yuffie, Rufus and Reno still around!  So sit back, open those eyes and take in the final chapter of Seven.  Very much worth the price of admission!",N/A

861168,"This is not one of Isabelle Huppert's best movies but she's always interesting to watch and her great performance is the best thing about this movie and quite frankly the only thing that makes it watchable and worth recommending.The film is essentially a road movie in which Sylvia, a prostitute, and Laurence, her estranged 14-year-old daughter, run away from Nice after the latter commits a crime to defend her mother.  They head to find Sylvia's husband and son, which she abandoned three years before and erased from her memory.  Along the way, they meet a friendly fugitive who helps them.The cast is excellent and the scenery is pretty, though there's a heavy-handed use of flower symbolism and U.S. country songs. In short, I recommend it only for Isabelle Huppert's characteristically superb performance (thought be warned that, even though she's great, this is far from her best films).",La Vie Promise

689400,"But the fact that you can get 85 episodes for around 80-90 dollars, this disc is ONLY for people who are JUST getting this one.So you can get this for 2.50 used on amazon and if you are already buying a bunch of stuff then this is a good buy, as long as you really like this show like me, then you need to get the very cheap boxed sets.So all of these episodes are classics be sure to at least get this disc even if you are not a batman fan.ON LEATHER WINGS- First ever episode created of the series, but not the first shown.  Surely the network thought that it was a little too dark and decided to show cat and claw like past reviewer said.  Their is a funny scene where a security guard and a nurse go to the back romm to get it on and when they start kissing in comes the man bat to save this from becoming a porno.  I always found little touches like this perfect for a kids-teenagers show.  Little did I realize that I would still love this show hust as much 10 years later.  The man bat is not one of my favorite episoed but would have been a nice premiere.CHRISTMAS WITH THE JOKER- A very dark episode to start out with where the Joker escapes form arkum and kidnaps the commish, his daughter, and bullock just for laughs.  AND SOME VERY GOOD LAUGHS THEY WERE.  The joker episodes were always the strongest, and they were certainly the best at the start of the series when the creators were still getting there feet wet.  So the joker has a great line in this movie where he says if the bat doesn't come and save the commish and company, and then he does like a throat slash.  Maybe he didn't or couldn't say kill but the gesture was even stronger.  So everything wraps up real nicely in this one with some nice batman electrifying torture and a classic joker falls into the lava pit or something and batman saves him at the last second.NOTHING TO FEAR- The origin of the scarecrow is shown in this episode and is done so VERY slick.  They easily could have done a 2-part series buy very nicely made it into a single complete episode.THE LAST LAUGH-this was a very inventive one and has one of my favorite character.""You've killed Captain Clown"".PRETTY POISON-I believe this is the first episode that has harvey dent(later two-face).  It is also the first appearence of Poison Ivy.It's too bad that this disc only has 5 episodes but when these first came out this was the best cause all the rest had  mother effing 4, only 4 episodes on it.  They certainly came out with the new batman series pretty quick, didn't they.Also if you are a real collector of this series, then this is worth 2-5 dollars for you also.  It has essential interviews with bruce timm talking about each episode and his thoughts on them individually.  This was THE only thing that was good about these scrawny little dvd releases.  He talks about how the first episode would have been perfect because it is batman versus a man-bat creature.  He also talks about introducing harvey dent to the series rather than just throwing two-face at you and having no sympathy for a very sad man.  Phantom of the opera obviously had influence on this, but still a great remake, redo version.",N/A

750600,"As true to the horror genre as the first 'SAW', 'SAW II' brings us back to the bloody depths of Jigsaw's intriguing games and puzzles, where blood is the price you pay for not playing by the rules.  I am as pleased with this sequel as I was with the original, bringing blood and horror back to horror where it belongs.  Hopefully, 'SAW III' will rise from the ashes of this grisly phoenix to entertain horror aficionados again.Detective Eric Matthews has cornered and caught John (Tobin Bell) the jigsaw killer.  Or has he?  When John tells Matthews another game is in progress, and shows Matthews footage that his son has been recruited for the game, Matthews is forced into Jigsaw's nightmare of trying to unravel the clues.The trap?  Several people are locked inside a dilapidated old house.  (The atmosphere of the house is sinister and disturbing, but not as filthy as the bathroom in the original.)  The doors to the house will open in three hours, but the players are already breathing in a poison gas that will kill them within two hours.  The players include Matthews' son Daniel (Erik Knudson) and Amanda (Shawnee Smith), who previously escaped one of Jigsaw's traps and is forced to play again.  John's tape informs them that there are antidotes hidden throughout the house, one of which is in the safe in the middle of the room they are in.  He tells them they all possess the combination to the safe; that the numbers are in the back of their mind.  Once they figure out what they all have in common, they will know why they are there.  X marks the spot (again).  Let the game begin.Amanda tries to warn her fellow players that she has dealt with Jigsaw's traps before, and that they must follow the rules, but the fear of death and the clash of personalities have the players all running for their own lives.  Needless to say, the house has many lovely traps awaiting our game-players.  We get to observe not only the players desperate struggle to survive, but witness Detective Matthews degeneration into his own madness as he struggles with John's mental games in order to save his son's life.Without the 'whodunit' value of the original 'SAW', the surprise in 'SAW II' comes strictly from the clues of the game, not a 'whodunit' but 'what was the most important clue'?  It is still a puzzle for the viewer to solve, and I will go no further on revealing any hints.  Suffice to say, pay attention, and get ready to be shocked, stunned, grossed out, and gagging with exquisite horror and delight as the blood begins to flow.  Watch for the peek at the original bathroom.I must add, I have never felt so drawn to a psychopathic killer in my life as I am to John.  I would kiss Jigsaw's cancer-withered lips and toes if I could find him.  I just hope he doesn't find me first.One more quick note.  When I saw Donnie Wahlberg in 'The Sixth Sense', I wondered how an awful ex-pop singer (the word singer used loosely) could turn into such a great actor.  While his performance in 'The Sixth Sense' was superior, he plays his role as Detective Matthews quite skillfully.  Kudos also to Tobin Bell and Shawnee Smith.If you loved 'SAW', you are going to love 'SAW II'.  If you love blood, guts, building terror, violent deaths, desperately selfish personalities, and cunning killers, this movie is for you.  Definitely a 'buy', 10 stars.  Enjoy!",Saw II
959240,"I didn't think it was possible. I thought there was NO way to make a movie that was both completely consistent with the game and yet be an awesome movie. And I was right. But this comes REALLY close to attaining the former constraint and blows away the latter with a BFG 9000. After all, the game is pretty much one guy fighting, unless you have it in multiplayer deathmatch. Not a lot of room for dialogue. It COULD be the story that leads up to the moment the game starts, but I think the route they went was better and it still did the game justice. My hat's off to you, Mr. Wells (the writer), you really did this thing right!I was pleased to see that the preview I saw was all lies. The premise had nothing to do with mapping the human genome gone horribly wrong (which would have been stupid), and everything was out of context. Which made the surprises all the more grand. And there are some MAJOR surprises in this movie. Fortunately I saw it in the theater first, before someone spoiled it for me. I was just kind of expecting it to be a general sort of fight-fight-fighting movie, like say, Blade, but this really had some bizarre, brilliant, unexpected twists. Imagine my surprise when The Rock gets dragged off by the monsters and shouts ""Hey, I'm not supposed to die!"" That would be like.... well, think back to when you first saw the movie Predator. what would have your reaction been if Schwarzenegger got killed halfway through the movie? You'd have said... ""What?""And oh, does this movie ever have a climax! The finale is THE greatest one-on-one fight I have ever seen in any movie. THE greatest anything-on-anything fight I have ever seen in any movie. Like I've seen anything like that in real life. THE greatest anything-on-anything fight I have ever seen. Now, I knew from the movie's website that there was going to be a sequence that was going to be like playing the game, but I didn't know how they were going to pull it off, and half expected that I had misunderstood something, and that REALLY wasn't going to be what would go down because it would be kinda dumb, but they DID it, and it WASN'T. A nice little homage to the game itself as it is played. If it were any longer, it would have started to become annoying (like watching someone ELSE play a video game - you then say ""my turn, my turn!"") but as it is, it is simply an innovative, never-before-seen-in-a-movie viewpoint. Exploring new frontiers. Memento explored the frontier of chronological order, Dragonfly and the 6th Sense demonstrated some weird perspectives (though I'm not sure if they were completely new), but I really don't think anyone has ever done anything quite like this. I keep a list of my favorite movies of all time (a rather extensive list, not the sort of thing one composes off the top of one's head in one sitting or one day), and this sucker just made number 3, right between ""Spaceman"" and ""The Triplets of Belleville"".

930498,"I was staying at my grandmother's house when I received Millions from Netflix. She doesn't own a DVD player, so we watched it on my $ 1100  HP desktop notebook with built-in speakers, a high definition widescreen monitor, a DVD ROM/DVD-RW/CD-RW, firewire ports for uploading video, and more USB ports than you can shake a stick at. We set it up on her kitchen table, popped in the DVD, turned out the lights, and watched in awe (and uncomfortable wooden chairs) as Danny Boyle's masterpiece unfolded before us.If you ask me, family films are the most difficult types of film to make because the genre provides itself an excuse for poor quality: it's for kids, who cares? But when a family film is willing to touch on difficult subjects (family, economy, religion) in an honest and fascinating way without condescending to the audience, that's when you achieve magic.Damian and Anthony are dealing with a difficult point in their lives. Their mother just died, and they're adjusting to a new town. When they first step foot into their new home, Anthony is ecstatic that they were able to get such a big house at such a small price given the trends of real estate value and such (he gets his own room!). Damian, on the other hand, isn't really concerned with this. He's busy getting visits from his favorite saints who pop in occasionally to give him advice. They might know ""Saint Maureen."" Besides, all this extra space is pretty intimidating (and he has to sleep alone).One day, a bag full of money falls from the sky, and the brothers have to decide what to do with it. They don't have much time because in two weeks Britain switches to the Euro. Damian naturally wants to give it to the poor, but this proves to be more complicated than he expected for a variety of reasons. Anthony naturally wants to invest in a condo or open a bank account so they keep their value even after the currency change. Again, there's a problem: ten-year-olds can't purchase real estate or open bank accounts with parental supervision.Granted, the movie is a little predictable. It doesn't take much imagination to figure out where the money came from, and I don't really have to explain who that suspicious man is that Damian meets where the money fell. His final encounter with a saint was inevitable from the opening scenes (even my little sister predicted the lines of their exchage), but none of that matters when a film has this much power, honesty, and heart.Danny Boyle is a director known for making films you shouldn't take your kids to see. Trainspotting, more than any other film I've seen, understands the nature of addiction. 28 Days Later is one of the bleakest and most intense horror films of the new millenium. Here he has crafted his best film by applying the same insight to a much sweeter film. I'm hard-pressed to think of any other family film since The Hunchback of Notre Dame to dig this deep this well. A true masterpiece and one of the best films of the year.",N/A
637177,"In the wake of recent successful zombie movies like 28 Days Later, Shaun of the Dead and even a remake of George A. Romero's own Dawn of the Dead, Universal decided to milk every last drop of rancid milk money out of that zombie teet. Romero was given a reported $15M budget (his biggest ever) to create Land of the Dead, the fourth movie in his ""Dead"" saga.Like the previous sequels to Night of the Living Dead, none of the characters have returned even though the movie is set in the same post-zombie apocalypse America.My initial reaction to Land Of The Dead was that it was a pretty good big-budget zombie movie with several magical Romero touches of brilliance. Since it was financed by a Hollywood studio, I felt that Romero probably made some compromises. Hopper and Leguizamo were both great, but most likely were cast because they are well-known stars. Hopper and Leguizamo will always be Hopper and Leguizamo in every movie I see them in. I like them both, but they rarely disappear into a character.While it's not quite as strong as last year's Shaun of the Dead, I do think Land of the Dead is one of the better zombie movies to come out in recent years. It's easily the 3rd. best movie in Romero's ""Dead"" saga. There's plenty of action and gore for everyone, and I highly recommend seeing this DVD.",Land of the Dead
695981,"So obviously the acting could not get any better.  But the story is the thing to watch.  If you have not seen the first episode let me catch you up.  Zatoichi came into town and was unsuccessfully hired to help take out a rival gang in town.  One side had already hired a master samurai.  When that samurai became sick the other gang thought they weren't going to fight.  But he shook off his sickness for a final heroic stand and helped the gang he was hired from beat out the other one even though they were outnumbered by double the swordsman.  But then the samurai decided that he must face Zatoichi before he dies.  ""Better than dying at teh hands of goons"".  I am horrible at quotes but it was something like that.  And then the table were turned and the gang that had more men ended up winning.  Also from thsi Zatoichi became known as like a one man army.Well in this one he is back in town one year later to visit the grave and pay his respects to this samurai.  The story starts out almost a bit dumb but you forgtet it and it turns good minutes in when Ichi starts some sh** talking and though justified, he may have gone too far.  Well these people are not happy and decide to try and kill him.  What follows is a VERY good story about another samurai who we find all about.  Ichi ends up meeting this ""samurai"" and we find out the connection between the 2.  The whole movie I was deciding whether or not this should be a 4 or a 5, but then the end happened.  You don't f*** with Zaoichi or anybody who is close too him.The DVD is amazing picture quality, even though it is in black and white.  Also perfectly letterboxed and some of the best subtitles you will ever see traslated for asian cinema.","Zatoichi the Blind Swordsman, Vol. 2 - The Tale of Zatoichi Continues"

886983,"La Boheme is certainly one of the top three performed Operas worldwide, along with Carmen and Aida. It is not my favorite Puccini Opera; that distinction goes to Manon Lescaut which, as opera critic Irving Kolodin so perfectly phrased it, is ""the most of the promise, with the least cost of the fulfillment."" I don't begrudge Puccini his popularity: his music is often beautiful, the emotions direct and heartfelt. His librettos seem designed to tug the heartstrings in a plebian grab for popularity, like a television show tested by a focus group. But that's OK. So when I see a production of any of Puccini's most popular operas, I tend to concentrate on sound: the beauty of the instrumental music, the vocal qualities of the singers. I usually ignore the plot. A misguided fear of being manipulated by a master? Probably. I'm weird that way!So when I say I loved this DVD of La Boheme, that I was engrossed by the drama as well as the music, then it must be something special. The Met usually mounts traditional productions. When they stray from that conservative path, the audience tends to get ornery. This Boheme is a classic production: no ""artistic license"" shifting the action to the surface of Mars with a cast of farm animals and an orchestra of kazoos! I like a traditional Boheme, the way Puccini envisioned it. The emotions are less over-the-top, the drama more organic. The libretto is direct, even simple. That simplicity is the source of this production's excellence.Produced live on 15 March 1977 and the inaugural telecast of the PBS ""Live at the Met"" series, the DVD transfer effectively reduces many of the artifacts inherent to a 30 year old taped program. The image is still a little fuzzier than we're now used to, but not enough to drive you screaming up the wall. The DTS 5.1 sound is clear and full. As for the singing, both Pavarotti as Rodolfo and Renata Scotto as Mimi are at their absolute peak!This Boheme features a sublimely sung Rodolfo. All of the things Pavarotti was famous for are in evidence here: crystalline tone, perfect diction, fluidity of vocal quality. And this younger, svelter Pavarotti actually acts! I was moved by his performance in a part he obviously identifies with. As for Scotto, a leading soprano at the Met for two decades, her singing is lovely, with a limpid quality that heightens the emotionalism of her superb acting. The excellent cast includes Maralin Niska as Musetta and Ingvar Wixell as Marcello.James Levine had come into his own as a Conductor around this time. He offers a nearly perfect rendition of this verdant score. The Met Orchestra, obviously on the rise as one of the world's great ensembles, sounds wonderful. Watching them hang on Levine's every gesture, turning on a dime as they negotiate every twist and turn of this score, is one of the pleasures unique to the DVD format. As for the production design by Fabrizio Melano, it is simple and direct. It just looks right!I don't know if my atitude towards Puccini as a dramatist will ever change. But productions like this one, saved for posterity, are a clue as to why audiences adored Puccini in the first place. Before time and popularity seemed to cheapen the drama until it resembled a High School production of Cats. I love Puccini just like everyone does, of course. It's just that every now and again I need to be reminded why I love him. I strongly recommend this superb DVD. It's the jolt you need to get you in touch with your inner Rodolfo and Mimi.Mike Birman",N/A
994348,"Well, here it is: the final DBZ movie.Unlike most of the other DBZ movie releases, it seems like this one has been pretty well hyped through the commercials and the movie's general rep already. So I guess it makes sense that this disc come not in a regular black case, but a clear one with some okay art on the inside cover.In general, the overall writing for FUNimation's dub as well as the original Japanese version is better than the average DBZ movies which are kinda lackluster and derivative. However, like most of the other DBZ movies this doesn't fit into the series' continuity, so don't even try and say otherwise.For those of you in the dark, the movie focuses on an alien named Tapion who is considered a hero for sacrificing his body to seal up half of a giant beast-- Hildegarn (or as the dub calls him 'Hirudegarn'). It can only get better from here.On a technical level, the video quality isn't exactly gorgeous in comparison to newer anime, but what do you expect from something made in'95?As for ""extras"" we're given the same 'meh' FUNimation extras as usual: badly written character descriptions and some trailers for future releases.In conclusion, this is a pretty good movie that's a must have for any DBZ fan, dubbie or subbie alike.",Dragon Ball Z: Wrath of the Dragon

374398,"I saw this film years ago when it had its major theatrical release.  Years later, it remains as powerful.  The wonderful, odd vision of Peter Jackson (Director of LORD OF THE RINGS trilogy) is put to use in this story of two young girls whose fantasy world runs amok.I think it would be fair to say this is the breakout film that brought Kate Winslet to the well-deserved attention of a world market, but her co-star Melanie Lynskey gives the more complex performance of the two in this, if only because her role is given more layers.  The DVD is an uncut version, and it lends a different light to her sexuality than the version in theatres, but it is all still awkwardly (perfect for this story telling) ambivalent.Jackson makes weird and wonderful use of the clay figures and fantasy land of the girls, and although I don't really think he has a full handle on what a girl's fantasy land would be made of (this one was awfully muddy - ick),  it is still a compelling, complete and disturbing vision - all fitting.  There are truly great moments which feels completely, messily, real.  Sarah Peirse's entire performance is wonderful, as the more downtrodden and distressed mother. This is really fine acting.Not long after the film was released, the actual case this was based on was re-opened, and it was found that, as part of their ""treatment,"" the girls were given a drug to sedate them, but it has since been shown to cause extreme violent outbursts.  It is too bad this information could not have been available as the film was made.  I believe Jackson could have incorporated this and made the film even richer.  But that would be icing.

159123,"THE STAR WARS movies (the original trilogy) are perhaps some of the greatest movies ever made.  They had great characters, a fantastic story, brilliant acting (at some parts) and were just all around fun.  I grew up, of course, after they came to theaters, but like most people, I had them on VHS.  I was also one of the millions of people who said Star Wars deserved a huge DVD release.  In 2004 I got it, and much to my dismay, it wasn't exactly what I expected.  Some of the changes are not for the better.  On the contrary, the majority of them are worse.  The DVD set released in 2005 is essentially the same, only you don't have bonus features... which is alright, the bonus features were nothing special anyway.  The release in 2004 had four documentaries (the only good one being the A&E; Special: Star Wars: Empire of Dreams), an XBOX demo (not a big XBOX fan) Star Episode III Preview (useless now) and commentary.  That was about it (at least the bulk), and after such a long wait I wanted more.  Like say... the holiday special that I, someone who grew up in the 90's NEVER got to see.  Ever (say sorry).  I also wanted the indiviual makings of the movies.  When this DVD relese came around, I was disappointed that none of that stuff was included.Star Wars was full of fun, action, loveable characters (well developed too), story and just about everything that could make a good movie.  The Empire Strikes Back is often cited as the greatest sequel ever made (especially with the line: ""Luke, I am your father"").  With how successful and well accepted the films became, why did George Lucas decide to change it?  Especially to connect it with the prequels?The changes aren't just small things either.  They're things that have me pretty upset.  I'm talking more than just ""Who shot first?  Han or Greedo?"" (but we all know the scene really is messed up and somehow lessens Hans' character).  What I'm talking about are the even bigger changes such as Hayden Christensen appearing in Return of the Jedi, the CGI which is supposed to be superior, but looks a lot worse.  I'm also tired of Lucas doing things like, replacing real life extras with CGI characters.  This might stem from the fact that then Lucas had virtually nothing to work with, and now he has just about everything to work with.  He's opting for Computers over raw talent.  I'm not against computers, I'm just saying these films were already perfect the way they were, and now that Lucas has come in trying to make them even more perfect, he's destroying them.  A trilogy that once stood above everything, is now being reduced.  Boba Fett's voice is now the same one who did Jengo Fett in the prequels, Anakin's ghost is Hayden Christensen, even the music score has been altered to some extent.  Conversations have been altered with terrible dialogue (most notably is the conversation between Darth Vader and the Emperor in The Empire Strikes Back), things that were already given CGI treatment for the 1997 release were given even more CGI treatment and it looks terrible (most notably, Jabba the Hutt in A New Hope).Overall, I'm disappointed with the DVD release.  And this isn't the last to come.  According to IMDB, Lucas has another release of the trilogy scheduled for release in 2007.  I probably won't pick that one up.The 1997 release was much better than this.  The 1993 release even better.  Movies shouldn't be altered to let them compete with ""newer"" movies.  I think people have enough common sense to say to themselves, ""You can't expect a movie made in 1977 to look like a movie made in 2006.""  There's a reason why the color version of Casablanca caused an uproar, and there's a reason why the original Star Wars trilogy being tweaked is causing an uproar.  You're supposed to preserve classics, not ruin them.  I doubt Lucas will ever let people nostalgic for the original have it.  Honestly, he should have two sets out.  One that's completely the original versions, every single mistake every CGI taken out and everything we loved about the original and one with all these ""tweaks"" for those who actually like them (you can always strap that one with a warning sticker or something).  But don't limit our choices to only being able to have a trilogy that's been tarnished.I'll let it slide with a three.  Three stars because they were three great movies.  But some of these changes aren't for the better.  Digitally restored pictures and sound I can deal with, altered sequences I can't.",Star Wars Trilogy THX Digitally Mastered Edition
1024859,"Just a week before the 2006 NFL season began, I thought this might be a good mood-setting movie. Though I wasn't too sure Mark Walberg was a good fit for this role, I must say, INVINCIBLE greatly exceeded my expectations. This is the best movie Disney has put out in a long time.This is the true story of Vince Papale, who played three years for the Philadelphia Eagles. When coach Dick Vermiel took over the struggling Eagles in 1976, they were coming off a pathetic and disappointing season. Originally intended to rally fan support, Vermeil held open tryouts for the team. No one held realistic expectations that anything would come out of it, but up stepped Vince Papale, an out of work school teacher and part time bartender. This movie accurately tells Papale's story and perpetuates the ""never say can't"" story that professional sports so often provides the backdrop for. Add this to such stories as Rudy, The Rookie, Sea Biscuit, and even a fictional story also based in Philadelphia, Rocky, as another improbable story that overcame the impossible.The movie is exceptionally well cast. Walberg holds his own as Papale and the surrounding cast of Philadelphia blue collar workers is perfect. Greg Kinnear superbly portrays Vermeil, though I really expected to see at least one scene of Vermeil crying in the locker room, which he is notorious for.This is a feel good movie you shouldn't miss.

Smith does a pretty good job playing the talented music minister, Ethan Jenkins -- the son and successor-to-be of the successful Pastor Jeremiah Jenkins, senior pastor of The Rock (Mega)Church and founding pastor of the inner city church, The Second Chance.Smith plays an interesting character.  While his own road to success may have been paved by that of his father, he wants to do the right thing and has a good heart. A bit naive, perhaps, in his view of life and ministry, he is greatly affected by what he sees and experiences at The Second Chance Church when he is sent there by a miffed church board as ""punishment"" for being a little to loose with the church's live television broadcasts.Jeff Carr is very charming and convincing as the passionate - ""in your face"" - and somewhat jaded-by-reality Pastor Jake Sanders. He believes strongly in the ministry of the Second Chance Church in his community -- but he's allowed his anger and his temper to cloud some of his decisions and judgment. (Sanders' tongue is actually what gets Ethan Jenkins in trouble when Jenkins gives him some air-time on the The Rock's live televised program -- ""Well, then... you can just keep your damn money!"")Jenkins and Sanders are then forced to work together. Sanders' inner-city method of ""ministry"" is sometimes more than wide-eyed, open-mouthed Jenkins can swallow... (When Sander slams a drug-pushing gang-member up against the fence and threatens to break his arm if the gangster doesn't let his little brother ""out"" of the family business... well, Jenkins hardly knows what to do with himself.)Both Jenkins and Sanders go through some pretty significant yet believable changes as they learn from each other -- perhaps Jenkins moreso from Sanders. And even Ethan's father, Pastor Jeremiah Jenkins, has to face the reality that even though his ministry at The Rock has gone global, he has forgotten where it all started... leading the movie's climax to a heartfelt and satisfying ""conclusion.""Pick it up.

429248,"Utu - Maori for `Blood for Blood' - is almost a great film. It's certainly a terrific `Western,' even if it is set in New Zealand in 1870. It's a Maori version of any number of Westerns where Geronimo jumps the reservation and starts a private war, with Anzac Wallace's army tracker Te Wheke deserting when he finds the British Army have destroyed his peaceful village and seeking revenge on all the `Pakehas.' As his guerrilla war continues, more and more Maori soldiers desert to Te Wheke's cause (not always welcome, either), preconceived notions of right and wrong are challenged as alliances and agendas shift until nobody's hands are clean.Director and co-writer Geoff Murphy really knows how to use the camera to best effect and uses the landscape superbly, capturing the wet humid feel of a country at once half-built and already decaying, but more than that he tells a great story with some terrific scenes that hark back to a style of classic but morally complex storytelling that went out of fashion in the late 60s and early 70s. There's also a level of savagery that's long been lost in American cinema - not only does he hang the verger from bell rope but he also hacks off the head of the vicar in front of his congregation and then delivers a sermon of his own with the head resting beside him on the pulpit. The action scenes are superbly handled, at once brutally realistic and engrossing. Unfortunately he miscalculates with Bruno Lawrence's initially intriguing settler seeking revenge of his own, overplaying the comedy in his madness. It's not enough to overbalance the film but it does undermine the character, and it's often unnecessary in a film which has a lot of dry wit in the script already.Sadly the DVD copy is pretty disgraceful, a real pity for a film that looks this good.",Utu VHS

866843,"After seeing the original production, produced in Japan, I was amazed at the contrast between the original and this Hollywood version knockoff.  Hollywood failed to deliver anything decent, despite the well made original movie they started with. This original story is tasteful, timeless and offers characters we can identify with.This plastic, Hollywood version of the same film showcases yet another uninspiring, typical Hollywood mysogyny mess filled with little more than the usual unmatched market-centered mediocrity.The Hollywood lead is the usual 'star' stud.  He pretends to be a middle aged, professionally advantaged, well-monied power monger who is bored with his life of excess and ease.  He decides to amuse himself and begins his clandestine diversions behind his wife's back.  He ventures into the ghetto, away from his peers and associates.  Here he enjoys slumming on the sly, in hot persuit of his target: a trashy, morally bankrupt, trampy, immature, barely legal dance teacher.  Their lines and interactions are vitriolicly vile in thier predictable, prepackaged, perverse platitudes.This original Japanese story gives far better.  Here is a man who is struggling to find meaning in a life filled with an emptiness he can't quite grasp. This original story isn't wonderlust, this is a shared sense of loss, futility, and disappointment that we can connect with.Hollywood plot changes aside, the casting choices were wrong.  Lopez gives the role a crass cheapness that crudely removes the ramining hints of class, elegance or distinction from the already disfigured indignity by Hollywood upon the original storyline.Here is a fine example of a beautiful story gone to hell in the hands of Hollywood.Hollywood doesn't make too many 'movies', mostly are little more than glorified infomercials, airbrushed extensions of playboy, and mindless marketing campaigns with idiotic dialog full of auditory advertisements and strict adherance to the ""sex sells"" standard.

I haven't seen the remake, but I can say that the 1939 version, under review here, is a near-perfect movie.  Burgess Meredith and Lon Chaney, Jr. are George and Lennie, the eternal, wandering pair whose only sense of home, of security, is found in each other.  The tiny Meredith (later of TWILIGHT ZONE and ROCKY fame) is perfect as quick-witted George.  I might add that while the novella's dialogue contains much swearing, this movie has none - yet one still gets a sense of George's acerbity from Meredith's exceptional performance.  The hulking Chaney is also ideal as slow-witted Lennie; as much as I admire Malkovich, I find it hard to imagine the role of Lennie played with more conviction, wonder, and unaffected pathos than it is here.  The film, with its Depression-era California setting, is beautifully photographed.  Like the novella, it is brief; no scene is longer than it needs to be, yet each scene makes an impact.  The musical score by Aaron Copland is not mentioned enough:  the composer's jagged, western-inspired style could not be more apt for Steinbeck; like Steinbeck's writing, its true genius is in its brevity.  The one and only ""wrong note"" in the movie is Betty Field as ""Curly's wife,"" Mae, who brings about her own and Lennie and George's destruction.  Lennie is supposed to be fascinated by Mae's soft hair, but there is nothing soft about Field's performance, and this lonely, victimized woman comes across as a none-too-bright tramp.  I can't help thinking that the role must certainly be played with more sympathy in the remake, but I still give five stars to the original OF MICE AND MEN.",Of Mice and Men

954089,"Years ago, I read Peretti's ""The Visitation"" and loved the character development and wary look at American church-ianity.  It depicted a town's struggle between a cynical ex-pastor and a charismatic newcomer, a grassroots preacher with a bag of signs and wonders meant to deceive God's people.  The story was so-so, but my personal connection with many of Peretti's autobiographical tidbits made it a wonderful read.When I rented this movie, I expected to be disappointed, to lose most of what I loved about the book.  Books into movies generally disappoint me, and when it comes to Christian movies--meaning, low-budget and preachy--the disappointment factor intensifies.  (Don't even mention ""The Omega Code"" or ""Left Behind"" to me, please.)  ""The Visitation"" actually rises above many of the typical problems, telling an engaging story, using nice camera work and decent visual effects, and enlisting good actors--although Randy Travis' character seems somewhat stiff due to the script.  The movie falters in its nonstop use of eerie music in an attempt to heighten fear, rather than trusting the other well-handled elements.  While it throws in some wry dialogue between a group of local ministers, it also resorts to a few moments of cliched exorcism and a final plea for redemption that seemed forced, in light of everything else.Yes, this movie deviates from the book in a number of ways, but the story's elements remain intact.  Peretti's thematic point in the book was not to diminish God's miracle power, but to remind believers that a relationship with Jesus is the necessary foundation for discerning between good and evil spirits.  While this point is mostly lost in the film, ""The Visitation"" proves to be an entertaining, sometimes thought-provoking experience.",N/A

This is the best Phantom I have ever seen and Emmy Rossum was the right choice for the role of Christine. Her talent, beauty and palpable devotion to her teacher tells the real story in just one look and gesture of her hand. Watch the scene just once and you'll never doubt why he loved her enough to let her go.

176827,"Okay, so the premise of 3 life long dorks playing one for the team, that team being nerds everywhere, has been done before right?  I mean almost every comedy tackles this somehow.  What makes this movie work is the efforts of David Spade and Jon Heder and then there's Nick Swardson who plays Spades brother Howie who is scared of the sun and never leaves the house.  Between the three of them we are kept laughing quite a bit.  Rob Schnieder isn't really all that funny here and he's supposed to be the serious one of the group.  This movie is by no means great but it's good and it delivers quite a bit in the laugh department, with Spade doing what he does best (playing the funny loser) and Heder revisiting what made him famous (Napoleon) and then there's that whole girl scout scene with Swardson which MAKES this movie.  All in all it's worth a decent laugh and won't REALLY waste your time.  Craig Kilborn, Tim Meadows and Jon Lovitz also co-star, Lovitz always making me laugh.  I give it 3 1/2 stars.  I saw, I laughed, and in a year or two I'll see and laugh again.",N/A
251217,"""Beaches"" is a film about two best friends from two very different worlds. Barbara Hershey plays the role of a well-to-do young woman, who on summer vacation at her father's beach house, as a child (played by a child actress), befriends another little girl played by the girl from ""Blossom,"" who is from Brooklyn and is from the ""wrong side of the tracks,"" but has dreams of making it big someday in show business as a singer.Fast forward, they grow up, become succesful in their own right, but take very different paths--only to be reunited again.Sadly, one of the characters develops cancer and passes away leaving her best friend to raise her daughter as her own.I highly recommend this film to anyone, who enjoys a heart-felt drama, but be prepared to have the kleenex box beside you because you will definitely shed some tears, at least, I did.The good thing is that it's only a movie and not based on a true story, which is how I coped with it, but still cried.Buy it or rent it, but either way, make sure and view this delightful, heart-warming film because you'll be glad that you did--I know that I am.Incidentally, ""Did you ever know that you're my hero"" is the main song played by the unforgetably-talented Bette Midler.*(Not recommended for younger chldren due to adult themes such as death.)*",Beaches VHS
967157,"This is one of my all time favorite tv shows. Although same in concept and scope than Bewitched, this shows superior cast and performances tower over Bewitched. I believe this show was much more funnier than Bewitched. Barbara Eden stars as Jeannie and Larry Hagman stars as Cap.(later Maj.) Anthony Nelson. And Bill Daily stars as Roger Healy, Maj. Nelsons best friend.  This dvd set covers the entire 1st season (30 episodes) of the series. Since this series 1st season was shot in black and white, this is the preference for me over the alternative colorized dvd set. As far as the video and audio go, the video looks fantastic. Episodes are clean and sharp with no compression. No dirt or scratches noticeable. Audio is in clean 2.0 mono sound. All episodes are complete and uncut. The pilot episode includes a audio commentary with Larry Hagman, Barbara Eden, and Bill Daily. It's nice and pleasant but not very informative. This is the main problem I have about this set. NO INFORMATION!! To me this keeps this set from getting 5 stars. The 4 dvds come in 2 seperate cases covering all 30 episodes. On the back of the cases you get episode #, title of each episode, and small description of each one. I think there should be more info than this, so I had hoped when I played the dvds, got to the main menu, and selected an episode, I would get a small amount of trivia, some more details such as  production date, 1st broadcast date, and cast listing with special guest stars. No such luck. I had hoped for much more info about each episode. You get a 14 minute featurette with new interviews with Sidney Sheldon, Larry Hagmen, Barbara Eden, and Bill Daily, which is a nice (but short) special feature. It's nice to see them together and still very good friends. They were the backbone of this great show (along with the late Hayden Roarke). Hayden Roarke was wonderful as Dr. Alfred Bellows. I would have loved for him to have been there too. In closing this is still a great set to have, and I intend to have all 5 seasons of this great show. I highly recommend the b+w dvd version of this classic show.",N/A
996059,"Made by BBC Films, this has something of the feel of well made television drama.  The story is simple, and quite familiar, but still manages to raise questions as to how a person's decisions are not radically free - perhaps an obvious point, but one that seems to bear repeating, especially given the context, namely, a released convict from an underprivileged background.  For Ricky, starting afresh means rejecting not just his own past misdeeds, but also his friends - and rejecting his friends (whatever there unfixable faults) is not just difficult, it also comes close to being immoral, so Ricky is truly torn.The influence of family is also well presented, and some of the gaps speak as loud as the presences, for instance the lack of a biological father in his life. The social realities are shown matter-of-factly and the film stops well short of being preachy.Curtis, as the twelve year old brother, is a charismatic figure, as is his friend Rio, but some of the other actors struggle to bring their characters to life - at times it's a little bit too obvious that they are 'acting'.  The camerawork, editing, and music all have a suitably 'realistic' English TV aesthetic.Perhaps not a classic, but worth a look.",Bullet Boy

153464,"_Pajama Party_ is the 4th entry in the ""beach movie"" series. _Pajama Party_ has it all: Throwaway songs, forgettable dialogue, poor dubbing, lousy twist music, ridiculous plot and plenty of semi-nude gyrating bodies. All of these attributes combine to make this movie totally enjoyable. Although _Pajama Party_ was an American International quickie, it has all the charm of a Disney movie during certain scenes. Maybe it's the old, familiar Disney characters, such as Elsa Lanchester and Tommy Kirk, in combination with Annette Funicello that help create this illusion.In the ""beach"" flicks, Annette always played a chick named Dee Dee or Jennifer or Connie or Dolores. Whatever. Her names changed, but the characters she played were always the same. However, in _Pajama Party_, Annette finally exchanges her bulletproof beehive for a more flexible Greek goddess hairdo. Later on, she switches to a Jackie Kennedy bouffant.

983613,"When a stranger calls is one of the scariest movies I have ever seen. . .until the end. The movie is about Jill, a high school student who takes a baby sting job somewhere in the middle of nowhere in a really big house which is, needless to say, a very bad idea. At first it is the easiest thing in the world. The fridge is stocked, there are plenty of movies, and the kids are all asleep. But than she starts getting dozens, and I do mean dozens, of calls from just about everyone she knows. But than she gets a call from a deranged sicko who wants to kill her for some reason. Don't ask me why, he just does. She starts to freak out and calls the police who send a police car but it will be 20 minutes until it arrives. But then she gets a call from the police who tell her the killer is inside the house. That is where the scares begin. Every dark hallway becomes a hiding place for the killer. Ironically the minute the killer actually shows up, the movie stops being scary and starts being nothing but an old fashioned slasher flick without the blood. He has lost the only thing he had going for him, his stealth. The more we see of him, the less he scares us.",N/A

Every shot is composed, lit and photographed as would Vermeer were he a filmmaker-every scene is a photo-painting in the style of the master. For the visual quality alone anyone with the eye, if not the actual skill of an artist , must see it.As for the story, the very cleverly developed tale is an interesting, if not predictable one. A young peasant girl (Grete?), whose artist father was blinded, needs work and is employed by the Vermeer household as a servant. The household, apprently run by Vermeer's clever mother-in-law and which is captive of a lustful and wealthy patron, who lusts after the the newly hired servant girl-Grete, as does Vermeer, whose wife is in a constant state of pregnancy, leaving the artist to seek out other conquests, one of which may be the strong-willed servant girl.

It also has Billy Corgan of the Smashing Pumpkins doing the score, but that apparent benefit is also one of the film's minor failings...  A score should undertone and strengthen a film's drama, but this movie with its excessive (and repetitive) fast-paced editing, directorial fat, and overfocus on the music makes it seem much more like an hour and a half long music video.That's cool if you're wanting a music video.  However, I don't imagine many people approach this film from this direction.  I would have prefered more focus on the rest of the craft of the movie, but that's just me.It's also slightly predictable in that not-good-predictable way.  There's one scene that seems kind of excessive but is foreshadowed earlier, though that doesn't mean it was necessary.  Overall the film just got too caught up with being some visual/musicy slamfest to slow down and think about what it was trying to do.--PolarisDiB",Stigmata VHS
546264,"Yeah, the dialogue ain't classic, the effects,sets, and costumes are beyond cheesy.  That said, after a couple of Earth Colas this sci-fi comic confection grows on you.  I didn't feel restless or bored and though the gags are hit-or-miss enough worked to give ""Galaxina"" the thumbs up.  It also helps that the film has a game and engaging cast.  As for Dorothy R. Stratten, the former Playmate of the Year who was murdered by her husband prior to the film's release, she is drop dead gorgeous as Galaxina.  Granted, there aren't enough opportunities to fluorish when you're playing a white spandex clad robot but there is a little in Stratten's performance that suggest that she could have had a career in film.  There's something a little touching in Stratten's scenes where she longs to be human so that she can pursue a relationship with the film's perfunctory lead, Stephen Macht.  In a nutshell this film may aim low but I found it eminently more enjoyable than some of the latter day pretentious CGI flicks.",N/A
740650,"Let's be blunt, the movie is, in essence, a little lumbering and flawed and has a rather odd climax. The beginning is overlong and vaguely too fantastical, but once you realize this is a very different world, a comic book really, and normal rules don't apply, it can be forgiven. In fact most of the flaws can be forgiven because of Ron Perlman and what he brought to the picture.This is one of few movies I've ever gone to see on the opening weekend, possibly the only one. And I did so because I was already a fan of Ron Perlman and it was great to see him in a leading role, even though he's covered in makeup. Perlman is the best thing in this movie; he is perfect as Hellboy. He swaggers through it as if he'd always been a leading man. Delivering one-liners with ease and to perfection, battling monsters through subterranean sets and city streets, and giving a great comedic performance as well as a very emotional one that makes you just love the big red oaf. A great feat considering the extensive makeup he had to act through.And the makeup and prosthetics are the best of its kind I've ever seen. There's movement and expression in the lips at times that you would think would be impossible. You might at first think that the lips are rather stationary and unexpressive, but if you just pay attention you'll see that there is a lot of movement and subtleties to it. Rick Baker should be praised for his work in this, it's amazing.Doug Jones is awesome as the body of Abe Sapien. His movements are truly beautiful. And David Hyde Pierce as the voice is perfect. Abe is a very interesting and neat character that I wouldn't mind seeing more of. And his makeup is as amazing or even more so than Hellboy's.John Hurt is great in this, as is Jeffrey Tambor. Everyone in this does a great job. But Perlman's performance as Hellboy really holds the movie together. His character stands out and speaks to the audience better than any other.If you liked X-Men or Spider-Man don't expect a movie as well polished and put together, but you should be able to enjoy it and the more overt comic book feel of the movie. And unlike the aforementioned movies there is quite a bit of light humor throughout Hellboy that should garner some laughs from most anyone.Hellboy isn't perfect, I would have changed some things, but I had fun watching it and in the end, especially for a movie of this type, I think that's what matters most. In fact I like it more now, after seeing it again, than I did when walking out of the theater.",N/A

It took me a long time to find it, but when I did I could see that this is more than your average slasher.The film is based around Christmas. Sorority girls are planning to take a holiday break. But a stranger who makes frightning phone calls leads to a more psychotic event that night.We are introduced to the killer through first person perspective as this is the way we always see him. This isnt your typical slasher movie with typical hack'n'slash death scenes of blood and gore but instead gives us a great amount of dark eerie events of intense psychological horror within these killings. Again, another horror film that shows horror doesn't require bloodshed.Although Black Christmas doesn't exactly contain truly terrifying scenes but instead contains a great creepy effect of silence throughout the sorority house and with probably the most creepy annonymous phone calls ever in a film. The tension and eerieness builds up brilliantly with great replacements of light, shadow and sound, leaving us to the end, with a creepy essence of dark atmosphere, with some things unanswered.And while Black Christmas contains no cheap attempts of modern day jump frights, this is a great horror film of its kind.

956801,"The first impression of In Her Shoes might come across like a melodramatic story, but with a director such as Curtis Hanson, the final product should be something else.  After all Hanson directed the brilliant thriller L.A. Confidential (1994) and the terrific film with the pot smoking college professor who could not finish his book in Wonder Boys (2000).  In 8 Mile, he caringly displays the tough upbringing of the infamous rapper Eminem, and how his efforts paid off after years of misery.  Thus, it is not without reason to expect that Hanson could pull off something extraordinary while the title plays directly towards the allusions of something trite and common.Even though, Hanson generously applies stereotypical females through Cameron Diaz's portrayal, as the typical long-legged blond bimbo Maggie.  Then there is Toni Collette, with several admirable performances since her roll as Muriel in Muriel's Wedding (1994), who reveals a counter-opposite character to Diaz through her excellent personification of the overachieving sister with strong type-A and anal-retentive tendencies.  Maggie, on the other hand, is the kind of girl men turn their heads after while Rose disappears in the masses.  The differences between the two sisters cause much friction between the girls, as Maggie's beauty enhances Rose's insecurity about her looks and her ability to date and Maggie internalizes her insecurity through Rose's driven and self-made success, as she lacks knowledge, wisdom, and skill.  The only thing that Maggie possesses is beauty, which she scandalously uses to her advantage to gain what she desires.  However, time is catching up with Maggie, which only increases her own insecurities.Through Maggie neediness for constant attention have formed this helpless woman that barely knows how to drive a car.  The only thing that Maggie seems capable of is to put together a sexy or fashionable outfit.  It often means when she runs out of money or place to stay she returns to Rose.  These moments are very difficulty for Rose, as does not have the heart to throw Maggie out, even though she is fully aware that Maggie will end up hurting her by using her for the moment.  Rose even makes effort to help Maggie stand on her own feet, and not be dependent on others by trying to find a job for her, which proves to be a far more difficult task that expected.  One of the best scenes in the film takes place when Maggie stays with Rose and it is when Maggie is trying on Rose's expensive shoes.  During this scene they talk about the purpose of having these luxurious footwear, which subtly enhances the distinct difference in their existence.The insecurities and personalities that Maggie and Rose hold stem from their childhood, which seems to have strong ties with their mother who passed away while they still were children.  Meanwhile, their father has remarried the stepmother from hell who does everything possible, both consciously and unconsciously, to make both sisters lives extremely difficult to deal with.  On top of this, Maggie discovers that their grandparents are not dead, as their father has said.  Instead, some hidden letters indicate that their grandparents live in Florida.  To make things even worse, Maggie crosses the line of no return, as she sleeps with Rose's boyfriend and gets caught in the act by her sister.  In this complicated situation, Maggie flees to Florida to use her unaware grandmother Ella Hirsch (Shirley MacLaine), as a resort where she can heal her wounds.To this point In Her Shoes seems to present a rather usual set up for a melodramatic drama, however, it is also at this point where Hanson throws in a wrench into the melodramatic machinery.  Instead of turning it to a typical romantic comedy, or sappy drama, Hanson transcends the film beyond the superficial anticipation of a silly over-the-top comedy of broken hearts and retribution.  The film brings the audience on a journey through the agonizing memories of distant and recent past, which allows the story to bring forth moving qualities such as forgiveness, understanding, and an opportunity for second chances.  The story occasionally feels a little too sentimental, however, Hanson incorporates these elements of the story with delicate touch in such a way that it feels natural and acceptable.  Thus, Hanson meets the expectations again, as In Her Shoes proves to be a poignant tale of two sisters' relationship issues that requires much change and wisdom.",N/A
983662,"Well, after you've seen this Saturday afternoon popcorn crunching flick, you sure don't wanna hear another phone ring. Just turn off the Cell and disconnect your land line. The ambience of the film is very well done although it's a little dark since the movie plays during the evening/night hours (duhhh!), but it's very stylish from the unique house and setting on the lake, etc. The film reminded me on highschool thrillers from and/or set in the 70s, because there are no real special effects and most of the thrill is provoked by scary looks, ambience, doors slamming and other loud noises during silent scenes as well as an excellent sometimes overwhelming score, and then the chase scenes like running through a dark forrest and the stranger almost catching the babysitter -- (I don't want to give away too much although the trailer already has anyway). There are scenes where you may want to close your eyes because you're expecting something horrific to happen -- the tension is there. Camilla Belle does an excellent job for her not even 20 years of age and she's the star of this movie and she would have either made or broke this flick -- a big risk for the director and the producers. But Camilla is brilliant and her acting is excellent for this type of film and I'm sure this film is going to add a big notch to her career -- we're not talking Oscar or anything, but just the fear and panic that she communicates is so believable.Well, it's a nice little scary movie for a Saturday afternoon and it's surprisingly well done.",N/A

Actually that is somewhat unfair to this movie.  There is thoughtfulness in the scripting, moreso than one would expect.  I am a fan of all of Carlson's films of that time.

Is it a joke or serious?Those misgivings were really a tiny part of my experience. I really did enjoy watching Transamerica and I think it's a great moviegoing experience. I wouldn't count on it to be enlightening, though.Bree (Felicity Huffman), formerly Stanley, is about to undergo a gender-reassignment surgery in Los Angeles when she learns that she has a troubled teenage son named Toby (cutie Kevin Zegers). Bree cannot deal with that issue before her surgery, but her therapist puts the surgery on hold until Bree sorts things out with her newfound son.Bree flies out to NY to bail Toby out of jail but fails to tell him the truth about who she really is. One thing leads to another and both characters find themselves going on a trip cross-country to Los Angeles.The dynamics between Bree and Toby is what Transamerica is all about. It's a non-preachy, very interesting and very controversial perspective on a slice of society that's marginalized by the mainstream and further marginalized by other already-marganalized groups as well!Go see it!",N/A
1028822,"I got the opportunity to see an early veiwing of ""A Scanner Darkly"" and the movie was quite well done, though it was somewhat complicated the film was very smart. The visuals were very different and unique and all around were quite stunning.In the not-too-distant future, Robert Arctor (Keanu Reeves) is working undercover to bust a purported drug ring; the drug in question is substance D, a highly addictive substance that scrambles the brains of its users. Arctor is so far undercover, in fact, that he begins using the drug, and becomes more paranoid as the reasons for his mission become clearer. The film was adapted from a novel by Philip K. Dick, and it contains many of the themes of his other works: fear of Big Brother, a totalitarian future, and technologies that make life more restrictive.As with ""Waking Life,"" the filmmakers shot the actors on video, and then animated their likenesses in a way that creates a dreamlike hyper-reality. The technique is right for the material; the additional veneer heightens the features of such recognizable faces as Reeves, Winona Ryder, Robert Downey Jr. and Woody Harrelson, and it contributes to the film's surreal air. If it's not always clear what's happening, and if ""A Scanner Darkly"" doesn't match ""Waking Life""'s wonderfully fluid meditation on the nature of existence, it's still a remarkable visual experience and an involving drama -- albeit one that takes a while to wrap your head around.",N/A
637598,"I don't know anything at all about Johnny Cash - save for that 'Hurt' and 'Tennessee Stud' are two of my favourite songs, full stop - and so I didn't have any checkboxes to tick or things I really wanted to see done right in ""Walk The Line"".What I saw was a movie that's certainly restored some of my faith in big-budget Hollywood pictures, a 2-hour-plus treasure that manages to be insightful, entertaining and - most importantly - real.The two central performances given by Joaquin Phienix as Cash and Reece Witherspoon as June Carter are runaway successes: each actor, in very different ways, bring individual and plausible life to their characters - no mean feat, when you consider that these characters aren't simple fiction. Their onscreen chemistry is palpable and, jaded old movie watcher that I am, I found myself instantly accepting the bond that Phoenix and Witherspoon portray together. Surprisingly, the vocals are all theirs, too (thankfully! with a vocal style as distinctive and unmistakable as that of Johnny Cash, it would have been stupid to attempt to lip-synch, in my opinion), and here more praise must be heaped on the pair - not only can they sing these songs, they perform them with real spirit and energy.Another cast highlight is Robert Patrick as Ray Cash, giving an excellent performance as the nasty daddy - perhaps the only flaw of the movie's script is that it does not allow for much development of characters like Ray Cash or Vivian - but Patrick and Ginnifer Goodwin, insofar as they're able, don't allow their small parts to become two-dimensional, so it's not all bad news.Direction is great - James Mangold displays a real sense of affinity with the music hall style of C&W; performance and, as with the rest of the picture, this comes across as a believable, plausible style. Musical numbers are kept nicely and wisely understated and the whole look and feel of the movie is very pared-back, but all the more rewarding because of this.All in all, this is an excellent character study: two amazing performances from the leads mean that a simplistic plot of boy-meets-girl-and-must-overcome-personal-demons-in-order-to-get-girl is showcased in a beautiful, satisfying and very real way.Wholly recommended. And I just went and bough my first ever Johnny Cash album, too!",Walk the Line

The best characters were Merlin, (loved him)  Morgan (great as usual in everything)  and her son Mordred. (very interesting)  The rest of the cast was quite good.  Liked the music and the dance by Guinevere.

913716,"Recently realizing that Jackie Chan and Jet Li are about done with movie making for the most part, I always wondered if there was anyone who could take over.  Chan and Li are one of a kind and the best out there.  Fortunately, Tony Jaa has entered the scene with skills and originality of his own.  The first thing I like about Tony Jaa is he is an expert in Muay Thai fighting, something new and original for the good guy in a movie.  The next thing I like is that he fights like Jet Li and does stunts like Jackie Chan, though once again he adds his own originality quite often.Ong Bak is pure action excitement - don't expect a deep story and do expect horrible English dubbing that is just down right annoying (you can still switch to subtitles with Thai spoken if desired).  If these 2 things don't matter to you, this movie just plains rocks.  Its a bit slow here and there, but overall it is filled with all the action you could want - illegal club fights, an incredible club brawl fight, tons of stunts and chases, a car chase scene that is actually done with carts instead of cars, a ring fight, and a good ol finale showdown that combines great fighitng with stunts, lasting for a good 10 minutes.  I also liked the background music for the movie - lots of smooth laid-back hip hop beats.I'm pleased to say that with newcomer Tony Jaa to the world of martial arts films, the loss of Chan and Li someday soon won't be as bad.  Ong Bak is brilliant action and originality. The only thing that could make it 5 stars is if it had a better story and decent dubbing, which Chan and Li movies do much better.",Ong-Bak - The Thai Warrior

673551,"Most important things about this theater version of Ah! My Goddess looks already covered by other fans. Although TV series version was actually produced after this movie version, this episode is most likely to be the last episode of all Goddess series in terms of time sequence, because the time frame of the episode is 2 years after Belldandy and Keiichi first met. They first met when Keiichi was a sophomore and now he is a senior. I am personally wondering to death what kind of life will likely to be after keiichi graduates the college.... But anyway, one thing I want to add for review is that Belldandy is now a bit possessive than before. In other episodes, she was nice to everybody, not just to keiichi, and did not show any jealous behavior, even when another girl hookks up Keiichi. She is quite different here. When Hasegawa got drunken and made fun of Keiichi with her breasts, Belldandy unconscientiously used her power to stop them. When Celestin, Belldandy's most trusted mentor, erased her all memory with Keiichi, she returned back to the nice-to-everyone mode. Although she is still extremely nice to keiichi despite the memory loss, her indifferent niceness sheds the sad gloom on entire movie until she finally gets aware of her ""one ugliness.""  Belldandy called her emotion toward to keiichi ugly, because she wants Keiichi just for herself and to share with no one, despite the fact that she, as a goddess, has to equally love and share everybody and everything. Well... I think she showed the possible limit of being innocent. At this level, innocence is almost a disease...  Anyway, if you are familiar with Ah My Goddess series, this movie version is like a perfumy drop of essence extracted from all Goddess series. I can't forget to mention the music. Actually, I listened to the OST music before I watched the DVD. I was first quite doubtful how such grandiose full-symphony music can fit in with Goddess stories. My experience later for DVD was... just ""Wow."" I regretted to death that I don't have 5+1 channel audio and 50-inch monitor. Somebody below mentioned about the English dubs. Yes, original Japanese voice certainly carries something that English version cannot offer. But they are not too bad after all, especially when you compare it with OVA version English dubs. In OVA version of Oh My Goddess (NOT Ah My Goddess), English dubs almost ruined the delicacy and finesse of the original film by unforgivably putting things in joke-like manner. I don't know who must to be blamed, translator, producer, voice crews, or even cultural difference, but clearly, the OVA version dubbing lacks appreciation. Fortunately, this DVD of Ah My Goddess is far better than the oVA version in terms of English dubs. But, the best is surely the original sounds. I never thought that Japanese language can this be enchanting.",Ah! My Goddess - The Movie

694362,A large rock-like construct has risen in an Asian desert.  The object defies gravity and looks like a sculpture of a tornado.  The US Military has been invited to investigate.  A top problem solver has been brought in.  The object seems o be impossibly old and its appearance is rumored to have brought a dead boy back to life.Tempers flare as the Chinese government tries to send in its own troops.  While the diplomatic and military arms of the governments clash it becomes evident that there is some sort of healing power associated with the object.  Access to the object's interior is gained and the revelations begin.  This object's place in our planets history is undeniable as are its immediate plans.A rather interesting story.  The plot ties in nicely to some theories of evolution and the development of Earth.  The special effect were pretty good although the typical problem of scale is apparent.  At one point we are told the size of the object while other scenes at a distance don't seem to match (nowhere near as bad as when Spider-Man was three stories tall).

985273,"This is a dull movie, and after you watch it, you'll see why it was released in February.  Starring Harrison Ford, the movie sets itself up and markets itself as a thriller with Ford, the computer expert having to break through the own security he set up to save his family.There's nothing high tech at all about this film.  A group of bad guys kidnap's Ford's family and won't release them until Ford does what they want him to do.  Ford easily does what they want but things go wrong along the way.  Now Ford has to find out where the bad guys are and save his family.The drama comes from Ford's interaction with his co-workers.

233119,"Let me offer a somewhat different take on this DVD. One of the big reasons to get it is of course the return of Marlon Brando as Jor-El. Donner did a masterful job telling the story of the first film making a very human story in terms of Superman's relationships to Jor-El, the Kents, Lois and the rest of the world. That, for the most part, is continued in this version of Superman II.  Wether you like Donner's or Lester's version depends on what your looking for in this sequel. If you like all action and little of the emotional ties, then your going to like Lester's version. But if you want more emotion and more explanation as to why things happened the way they did. Then you will like this.One of the most interesting aspects of both of the films is the connection between Brando and Reeve. You might remember in the first film when Superman first got to the Fortress of Solitude. Jor-El more or less held his hand through the whole journey. ""He was told ""This is who you are."" ""This is where you come from."" ""This is why you have powers and how to use them properly."" By the time we get to the second film, Reeve clearly has a rebellious nature in him concerning his father and his purpose on Earth. He's not outright defiant but it's reminiscent of every parent/child relationship. Eventually Superman would have to make his own decisions about his life. Aside from the super powers, it's still a very human emotional story.To those of you who are ripping on this version, please remember it's unfinished. And it will never be finished because Richard Donner will never get to work with Christopher Reeve or Marlon Brando ever again.Also Donner admitted that if he had finished I and II the way he wanted. He would have gladly come back for III and IV. Think about the marvelous course correction the franchise would have taken if that came to pass.He should have done Superman Returns as well in my opinion. Just has never been the same without him.  The good guys won this time though.",N/A

123013,"Although an excellent film, Otto Preminger's ""In Harm's Way"" (1965) has never been one of my personal favorites; probably because the most interesting character, Commander Eddington (Kirk Douglas), inexplicably turns into sex maniac and must redeem himself with an extremely silly kamikaze gesture. Since you have a lot invested in the character, the sudden manifestation of mega self-destructive tendencies (both figurative and literal) cause the film to self-destruct along with his character.The only positive about Eddington's downward spiral is that it allowed Preminger to give additional screen time to his ing&eacute;nue Jill Haworth. Her Ensign Annalee Dorne character ranks near the top of cinema's all-time cuteness scale, a pleasant memory whenever one thinks about the film.""In Harms's Way"" feels more like a film made just after the war than 20 years later. It begins extremely well with probably the best ""attack on Pearl Harbor"" sequences ever-in part because they are not the main thrust of the story and are not all that elaborate. Captain Rockwell Torrey's (John Wayne) is at sea when the attack begins and for him the biggest battle is political. With the help of politically savvy Commander Egan Powell (Burgess Meredith), and the moral support of a nurse from his generation Lieutenant Maggie Hayes (Patricia Neal), he weathers the accountability storm and eventually assumes a key command under Admiral Nimitz (Henry Fonda).As noted above, Torrey's aide (Eddington) is never able to adjust to the death of his less than faithful wife (Barbara Bouchet). His main competition for Haworth's character is Captain Torrey's estranged son, nicely played by Brandon De Wilde although the physical differences between the two actors make it very hard to accept the parentage premise. Interestingly, their relationship and physical mismatch is virtually identical to Wayne's earlier one with actor Claude Jarman in John Ford's ""Rio Grande"" (1950). Both De Wilde (""Shane"") and Jarman (""The Yearling"") were famous child stars trying to transition to adult roles. De Wilde was killed several years after his ""In Harm's Way"" appearance.The villain of the story (at least until Douglas becomes totally unglued) is Commander Neal Owen (Patrick O'Neal), a publicity seeking former congressman who has enlisted to serve as PR officer to incompetent Admiral 'Blackjack' Broderick (Dana Andrews).Somehow Torrey eventually finds time to actually fight the Japanese.Because ""In Harm's Way"" is often melodramatic soap opera rather than action adventure, Wayne gets a chance to really act and makes the most of it. It is arguably his all-time best performance, aided by Preminger's excellent acting for the camera direction and a very strong supporting cast that really challenged Duke to let it all go. His scenes with Neal are his all-time best.Preminger and his editor get high praise for the film's pacing, inserting quality subplots (like the Tom Tryon and Paula Prentiss romance) to keep things moving along nicely. Not so praiseworthy are the special effects, which may in part account for the 1940's feel of the film. There is poor use of optical-printer effects and the ship models sit so high in the water that they betray all efforts to make them behave realistically.There's an incredible panoply of recognizable stars including Slim Pickens, George Kennedy, Hugh O'Brien, Carroll O'Connor, Larry Hagman, and Stanley Holloway.Paramount's DVD is not just widescreen glory (an excellent 16x9 B&W; transfer) but has a considerable number of nice special features.

643631,"CSI and its various offspring continue to garner strong ratings on television as people are fascinated with how the authorities use state-of-the-art technology to solve crimes. The latest incarnation is Bones, a T.V. show that takes the CSI template and attempts to inject some humanity and characters that we actually care about. While the actual cases obviously take up most of an episode's running time, the personal details about the characters' lives are gradually revealed. The show took a few episodes to find its rhythm and fortunately its ratings were strong enough to allow it to get better.After the untimely demise of Angel, it is nice to see David Boreanaz in another successful show. While the writing isn't as strong, his natural charm is a large part of the appeal of his character. Also, his backstory - an army ranger sniper - hints at a slightly dark past. It also helps that he has excellent chemistry with co-star Emily Deschanel whose character also has an intriguing past - her parents disappeared when she was 15 years old. Deschanel is an excellent foil as she plays someone who is more comfortable in her lab surrounded by the remains of dead people than in a noisy nightclub filled with people. She clearly lacks the necessary people skills. However, Bones is hardly a helpless bookworm as she has plenty of strong opinions and is not afraid to voice them. She is also capable of defending herself physically as well.An easy comparison for Bones would be a combination of the partner dynamics of The X-Files with the formula of CSI. Where The X-Files dealt with supernatural crime, Bones deals with more natural crimes but the Mulder/Scully dynamic is certainly present in the relationship between Bones and Booth. What makes Bones work is not really the various cases but the characters and how we grow to care about what happens to them.The first disc features a commentary on the ""Pilot"" episode by executive producer Barry Josephson and creator/writer Hart Hanson. They touch upon the test screening process and how this resulted in a few changes to this episode.Disc three includes a commentary on ""Two Bodies in the Lab"" by actors David Boreanaz and Emily Deschanel. They joke with each other in this relaxed track. The two actors make fun of the sexual tension between their characters. But what is evident from this track is the genuine chemistry between them and one can see how this translates to what we see on screen.The fourth disc features several featurettes including ""Bones - Inspired by the Life of Forensic Anthropologist and Author Kathy Reichs"" a profile of the woman whom the character of Bones is based on.""Character Profiles"" are text biographies on each of the main characters.""Squints"" takes a look Bones' team of scientists. It's an actual term that is used and the cast members talk about the dynamics between their respective characters. They talk about how fascinating the technology aspect is.Finally, there is ""The Real Definition,"" that examines some of the overtly technical terms from the show and defines them in plain English.",Bones

934933,"When you're trying to decide if you should watch this movie, ask yourself a few questions:Do you like ""Elephant"" or any of Gus Van Sant's recent films?Do you enjoy indie films that focus more on imagery and emotion in place of words and action?Do you enjoy foreign films by directors like Bergman or Wong?If so, you'd probably enjoy this movie.  But if you're looking for information on Nirvana or theories on why Cobain killed himself, this movie is not for you.  If you're expecting a movie like ""Good Will Hunting,"" this isn't it.  And if you're looking for a more typical, insane story of a rock star on the edge, maybe ""Sid and Nancy"" would be a better bet.Gus Van Sant has made a very low key film here, and I think it's his masterpiece.  The ideas he's experimented with in earlier films (and especially in ""Gerry"" and ""Elephant"") are all present here and they combine to give a perfect picture of a confused, tired man who's just given up.As in ""Elephant,"" the director doesn't try to offer any explanations.  You see a Kurt Cobain like figure walking around in the woods or in a big house.  He seems almost tiny compared to these larger things.  You learn that he's a rock star and he's just escaped from rehab.  He doesn't talk much.  There are no emotional pleas for help, unless they come in the songs he plays while he sits alone.

957083,"Before I start this review let me just state that I love Miyazaki films, and in this case I did what many people swear up and down you shouldn't do, namely I read the book before watching the movie so that I could compare and contrast... where to begin. I think at this point it would be faster to tell you which elements from the book have been kept vs. which elements from the story have been changed...but I'll do my best.First, the similarities...-There was a girl named Sophie who lived and worked in a hate shop who came under a curse from the Witch of the Waste. She did age to her later years and left home to travel, where she came across a scarecrow. After this she did find the castle lived in by Michael (whose name in the film is changed to Markl) and the Wizard, Howl, and the fire demon, Calcifer.-Howl does have a curse on him and Calcifer is intrical to the curse and also to Howl's survival.-The scene where Howl dyes his hair and throws the tantrum is spot on in comparison to the book.-They do move house at one point and Calcifer must be removed from his hearth.-The many portaled door does lead to various places... Porthaven, Kingsbury, the Waste outside Market chipping (Sophie's home town) and to Howl's home in Wales. In the film the latter one lead to the wreckage from the war.Ok that's about where the similarities stop...now the differences...-For one thing, Howl's curse does not affect him. It does not change his appearance to resemble that of a bird, and it never really is an issue that he is cursed until he starts fulfilling all of the necessary parts to enable the curse on his head. The curse was cast by the Witch of the Waste, but Howl did start it when he caught a star in his youth (Calcifer) and combined the star with his heart.. Something that Miyazaki went into greater detail then Jones.-The curse was not brought onto Howl's head by Sophie giving it to him from the Witch of the Waste. He actually attained it from his nephew Neil who got it from his teacher, Miss Angorian, as a class assignment, which of course was just her way of getting it to him at his weakest point. Now, Michael actually unearthed it, because at some point it got exchanged with the spell he was supposed to be studying and he and Sophie spend some time trying to collect the elements of the ""spell"" before Howl realizes what it is and that they are only quickening  his doom.-Sophie did stand the scarecrow up and breath life into him by talking to him, but after that she was scared of him. He ended up trying to get her attention because he was the Prince under an enchantment, but every time he tried to get close to her she (and the other people in the castle) did their best to keep him out and away, thinking he intended to harm them.-Sophie's appearance doesn't alter from youth to aging woman. This was confusing to me, as there doesn't seem to be any rhyme or reason to this in the film, no lynch pin as to why she suddenly looks younger, unless it ties into her feelings for Howl... that really seems to be the only connection...when she's in love she flashes younger... I don't even think she gained her youth back in the end of the book even though the contract with Calicifer was broken... at least there was no mention of Sophie being young suddenly.-Michael's name has been changed to Markl in the film, but that is not the only difference. Michael's age has also changed. He's a young man in the book, I believe 15, and he is in love with Sophie's sister Martha, who was disguised as her other sister Lettie.-In the same vain Howl is in love with Sophie's sister Lettie, who is disguised as Martha... but Howl knows that she is Lettie because he can see through the enchantment. He spends a good time pursuing her in his enchanted suits (meant to aid in his charming young ladies) and his guitar until his heart is stolen away from Miss Angorian.. Who doesn't even appear in the film.-Ok, the whole love sub plot at all... um, they didn't fall in love in the book... Howl was a lecher who was pursuing numerous women and in the book he first fell in love with Sophie's sister, Lettie, and then his nephew Neil's teacher, Miss Angorian. Sophie ends up living with him in the end and that's about it. There was no ""walking on air"" scene in the beginning as a prelude to the two falling into romantic love...there was no feelings at all beyond that of familial.-The sub plot of the war in exchange for Howl's amorous pursuits... Hmmm... This may have been done for two reasons. One was so that Howl can fly about, showing off his bird form, and make himself look more sympathetic all around because he gives a damn about something besides himself. Two, Miyazaki loves animating huge air ships and mechanical things, tanks and what not... what's a Miyazaki film without an air battle? Well, the war added this typical Miyazaki element... except that there was very little war sub plot in the book. It was mentioned in snatches but not made that much of beyond snippets of conversations about Porthaven and Kinsbury and the armies. It was so little hinted at that I actually did not pick up on it that much on my inital reading until I went back (after viewing the film) and rechecked some things. It seems like they exchanged the magnitude of the lecherous plot with the war plot to make it more dynamic and take time away from Howl`s obsessions about himself...but that was part of the beauty of the book was that they weren't that technologically advanced (seemingly), it was more about the magic than the might. And, I'm sorry, but Howl being a vain and selfish man was one of the reasons I loved him. His tantrums and drama had me giggling like crazy, and if he weren't such a drama queen he would have been uninteresting and...well.. Like Howl was in the movie, a touch flat.-Howl was not conscripted to aid the King's in the war... he had different duties from each one that never quite seemed explained until you knew that he had to find the Prince Justin who had gone missing.-Howl's teacher was named Mrs. Pentstemmon, and she and Howl loved each other like mother and son. In fact when she dies Howl attends the funeral in disguise true, but he mourns her for some time afterwards. In the movie her named was Mrs. Suliman (who was talked at much in the book but ended up being cursed in the end) and she took both the Witch of the Waste and Mrs. Angorian's places in the latter part of the film as the villain. In the book the witch did not come to live with them and, though she wasn't the ultimate bad guy in the end she did cause them all quite a bit of grief.Ok, I know there was more, but I will have to reread the book and see the film again in order to catalogue them all. The last 100 pages I read in one day and then I watched the film in the evening, so some of the details are fuzzy. I do plan on reading the book again soon. It was wonderful and I think it's going to become one of my ""comfort"" books, as my friend Amy likes to call them. That being said, I have very mixed feelings about this adaptation of such a wonderful book. Obviously, I adored the book, it was a tremendous treat... and even though there were all of these differences between the two I actually enjoyed the film as well. Perhaps I would have liked it more had it been a touch more faithful to the book, but this is always the issue with adaptations, you either get an exact duplicate or creative license. Well, Miyazaki is one of my favourite creative minds to date, so I always enjoy his work... and this did have all of the elements of a great Miyazaki film. The animation and the scenery is gorgeous, the relationships with the characters is wonderful... the storyline, even though it is severely altered from the book, is interesting, although a bit... off. The thing I wish he would have kept in was all of those little touches that made the book so wonderful and made me think it was a perfect thing for Miyazaki to adapt... there are little nuances peppered throughout the book that seem so indicative of him to begin with had I not known he was adapting it I would have thought he should have... however he left out a lot of the good stuff that made this book so wonderful. I'm torn, I really am.I find I will have to consider the film and the book as two completely separate entities in order to enjoy both of them. Fans of his work will love this movie, as it is visually stunning and one of the best works he has put out, but I cannot get over some of the alterations and for me this brings the movie from a perfect to less than perfect. 4 out of 5 stars... for now. I'm sure I'll learn to love the film in time, but now I am still too intimate with the book to love the film.",N/A
830967,"Vincent D'Onofrio's somewhat warped Robert Goren continues to be the glue that holds this excellent series together.  Watching Vincent work, one almost feels as uncomfortable and/or jittery as his character.  Aided by tightly woven scripts and uniquely orchestrated opening scenes, this series continues to provide expert dramatic acting and is vastly entertaining.This third year has episodes unique in how they twist themselves from what you might have expected:  a cop with a sleep disorder; a woman in a vegetative state; the push for canonization of a religious figure; a psychiatrist and her psychologist husband's unorthodox game playing; a Svengali-like teen who gets girls to commit murder for him.  This and much more with good guest turns by actors like Claire Bloom, Judd Hirsch, Karen Sillas, John Savage, and Margaret Colin.Kathryn Erbe adds brilliant support as Vincent's partner and the series continues to be one of the strongest of the franchise.",N/A
921614,"As great of a show as C.S.I. is, its formulaic method of storytelling makes it, in my opinion, just a MURDER SHE WROTE for the 21st century. Each week there's a murder, each week the murder is solved (WOW, if it were only true in real life), and each week the murders get crazier and more bizarre because after 6 seasons... they have to keep thinking up new ways to kill people. Then there's the well deserved boffo ratings.Which brings me to VERONICA MARS... would Veronica Mars have those kind of ratings if it were on a more widely viewed and more widely dispersed affiliate network? I'm not sure. You have to be willing to commit. The show is more like real life. The who-dunnits aren't so cut and dry.The star of the show Kristen Bell, plays VERONICA MARS, a seventeen year-old Nancy Drewish super-sleuth. Using everything in her power to solve small scale crimes, like finding a missing dog, or finding out who stole the money from a friendly poker game, or even going a little larger and finding missing persons or getting to the bottom of sexual harrasment charges. Yet, you care about these things as if they were the most important thing in the WORLD... because they are... to Veronica.All the while, Veronica, in the back of her mind is treading into areas that may very well be more than she can chew, like why her mother left them and vanished without a trace, and what she may have to do with the murder of her best friend, and the fact that the man sitting in jail for the murder of her best friend is looking more and more innocent and why the parents of her ex-boyfriend are possibly involved in the cover up, and why her ex-boyfriend may be closer to her than she ever imagined, and why she woke up in a strange bed at a party one year ago with her panties off and no recollection of how she got there.It's all very complex and engaging and wonderfully addicting and creative. Watching the show reminds you of how complex the world is and how murders aren't solved in one episode and that just because the T.V. tells you that a murder is solved, doesn't mean it is. Money is power, power is control and control is usually hiding something.Which brings me back to my original point. VERONICA MARS is probably the most intriguing, engaging and most well-written show on television, but it is hiding away on the rarely-seen UPN network... We don't have a UPN affiliate where I live... and it's not even available VIA SATELLITE... that is what makes these DVD release so fantastic.I wanted to watch this show so bad, so I asked for it for Christmas. My fiance watched them in 3 days... cried, laughed, gasped and cooed about how wonderful the show is. A show she had never heard of... is now her favorite show ever.Now that I've bought these and watched them... I can only eagerly await the season 2 DVD release... because I still can't get UPN where I live.",Veronica Mars: Season 1

358249,"This must surely be the strangest movie that Audrey Hepburn made, though it's not without its virtues. Directed by her-then husband, actor Mel Ferrer, the 1959 movie is a fanciful adventure story where Hepburn plays Rima, a nymph-like ""bird girl"" living in the remotest part of the Venezuelan jungle. She is being hunted by the local Indian tribesmen for being an evil spirit, but she is protected first by her grandfather Nuflo and then by Abel, a young political refugee whom she rescues after he is bitten by a deadly coral snake. The slowly-paced story initially focuses on Abel's hazardous journey into the jungle with Joseph Ruttenberg's cinematography nicely capturing the authentic Amazon locations.Rima shows up as a shadowy figure about a half-hour into the film and doesn't speak until about ten minutes later. Leave it to Hepburn to exhibit any sort of conviction in such an implausible role. Looking ethereal if a little too styled and coiffed (even without Givenchy) and sounding entirely too Euro-cosmopolitan, she still exudes Rima's innocence while discovering the darker secrets of her past. The rest of the cast is not as lucky. Anthony Perkins, a year away from ""Psycho"", is irritatingly unctuous as Abel when he is not simply confounded by his heroic role. His low point has to be the ridiculous scene when he sings a love song to Rima as he strums his guitar. And where exactly did the guitar come from?Familiar character actors show up in the oddest roles. Lee J. Cobb, heavily made up as a cross between Uncle Jesse Duke and Santa Claus, turns in yet another ham-fisted performance as Nuflo, and Henry Silva is cast as another exotic as the ultimately nefarious tribal leader. Nehemiah Persoff has a small bit at the beginning as a greedy trader, while Sessue Hayakawa, of all people, has a mostly silent role as the tribal leader. Adding to the artifice is the obvious use of soundstages and matte shots to replicate the jungle, and the ending is pure Hollywood sappiness. This is a curio for Hepburn fans.",Green Mansion VHS
396303,"Honor, loyalty, comradship and most of all the Regiment. Concepts difficult to relate to in the 21st century. Are they really relative? This question I really can't answer, but it is eminently worth pondering. This movie and its stage play predecessor pose those questions. One must understand the attitude of people living in a foreign country, the change this makes on their attitudes, combine this with being an infallible being in that country, add strong tradition to the mix and you have the crux of this extremely well acted and written film. I recommend it very highly",N/A

If you can manage to suspend your disbelief this movie is quite a treat.Underworld has some nice fight scenes and made full use of special effects for its time. The story is well thought out. Although so much of the world has to be explained as well it is amazing the story is as well done as it is. And in my opinion the acting worked well for the overall movie.The director added in a lot of sound effects that give the sequences more emotion. The moody music and loud sounds help gluing you to the screen. If it is available, this is definately a movie you want with surround sound and the volume a notch higher than you usually watch TV. This movie is great if you get pulled into it and laughably bad if you are sitting on the side lines pointing at strange visuals.",N/A

961979,"Finally, one of the best shows of the 80s has made it to DVD (well, the first season anyway). I think part of the appeal of ""Desperate Housewives"" is the void it fills on TV since ""Melrose Place"" and ""Knots Landing"" went off the air. As good and funny as the show is, with the most beautiful women on TV today, it still doesn't come close to my second favorite TV show of all time (""Knots"" is second only to ""Moonlighting"" in my esteem). However, I never saw every season, as I was a bit young when it premiered in 1979. But by the mid-80s, my mom, grandmother, and aunt all watched the show and got me hooked. It didn't hurt that the show had the most beautiful women I had ever seen and I easily had crushes on Joan Van Ark, Michelle Lee, Donna Mills (and the actress who played her daughter Olivia), Nicolette Sheridan, and my personal favorite hottie Stacy Galina (whatever happened to her?).Though ""Dallas"" was considered a spin-off of ""Knots Landing"" by the creators, ""Dallas"" premiered a year earlier, as network execs thought it would be more successful and interesting than ""Knots Landing."" Only with the success of ""Dallas"" did ""Knots Landing"" begin and ultimately, ""Knots"" lasted for 14 seasons, longer than ""Dallas"" ten-year run (turning one season into a dream to bring Bobby back pretty much ruined the show's credibility). From the opening theme song (my favorite TV theme song of all time) to the unique way the opening credits rolled from right to left across the screen, this show always got me excited to watch during its later half-80s heyday. In fact, my dad had a bedtime curfew of 10 PM on school nights, so I had to sneak downstairs on Thursday nights to watch the show, which only added to the excitement factor of this show.Because ""Knots"" covered a huge span of my growing up years, I feel like the characters are real people who I've come to know and love. All that's missing was an annual Christmas newsletter from those residents of the cul-de-sac. With so many story lines, it kept our atttention through the years. I remember most the heartbreaking story about Karen's drug addiction and the kidnapping of Val's twins. And while Abby Ewing often played the villain, I still found her to be an extremely likeable, seductive charmster that Alexis (of ""Dynasty"") never was. Perhaps it's due in part to the fact that Donna Mills is such a major hottie to begin with.Hopefully they will release all seasons of this show on DVD, coming out in seasonal intervals instead of one per year. Though I'm not sure I'd buy every season on DVD (what a major expense that would be)...but I do want the seasons I most remember, especially the ones when Stacy Galina was on. Through netflix, however, I will be able to finally watch it from the beginning at my convenience, perhaps even a show per night. There has never been a show like it before or since. It was easily better than ""Dallas"", ""Dynasty"", or ""Melrose Place"" and I don't understand why it went off the air in the early 90s. I'm still curious what those residents might be doing now. That's how deep an impact they made on my TV viewing habits!**Now that I've watched every episode of Season 1...my impressions: I like the spinning cul-de-sac idea. Not bad for the opening credits...though I'm interested when they switched to the sideways rolling moving images that we're familiar with in the later seasons.I never knew about Ginger and her philandering record-industry husband. I wonder when they disappear from the show. What most impressed me about Season 1 is how stellar Karen Fairgate was from the very beginning. I was impressed in each episode. In fact, it is she who is the bedrock of the entire series, even though it was meant to be a Dallas spinoff with Gary and Valene Ewing. But the episodes in which Karen flirts with J.R. Ewing so Gary can sneak into his office to peek at some important files, or when she thanks a young school teacher for his offer of an affair because it made her feel younger and desireable, even though she declines to actually go through with it (the offer was enough); and when she tests her husband Sid when his ex-wife shows up to see if he truly resolved his unresolved feelings for her...all I can say is, WOW--WOW--WOW! I've always loved Karen the most, and from Season 1, I love her even more. This series is worth buying and watching from the very beginning. Season 1 started strong and we fans know that it will only get better. But in the first season, I was struck most by how well the morality and strength of character comes through in a very entertaining way. You really can follow Karen and Sid's example and lead a very moral, ethical life. These shows teach us things like how we don't need to actually have an affair to learn why just even thinking about it leads us to deep-rooted psychological needs of being desired by someone. To actually go through with the act is a sin, but if someone tempts us, we should examine why we are tempted, what it means, and thank the person for making that offer so we can search the deeper reasons why without actually doing it. Wow, what can I say. This show had it right from the start. Thank you to everyone who was ever involved in this great show that will stand the test of time and stands mountains higher than ""Dallas"", ""Dynasty"", ""the Colbys"", ""Falcon Crest"", ""Melrose Place"", and ""Desperate Housewives"". This show is definitely a keeper! Bring on the rest of the seasons!",N/A

808199,"I began this movie thinking that it was just another vehicle for Tom Cruise, but I must say I was pleasantly surprised to find a real movie. The character development is a bit loose and had somewhat of a rushed feeling. The story sometimes came off as unbelievable or inconsistent, for instance the first battle where Tom Cruise is captured really does not connect to the other part of the story. Tom being wounded defeats several samurai warriors, later his fighting skills were shown to be much more inept compared to the samurai. This did not seem consistent to me. The Japanese Emperor not knowing what to do and playing both sides of the fence seemed a bit unbelievable.You get the feeling that the reason why Ken Wantanabe's character respects Tom Cruise so much, is because that they both were tortured battle tired warriors. Overall, I did enjoy this film. It does have some beautiful cinematography. Nevertheless, the violence is extremely graphic and there are some scenes where Tom Cruise is drying out from alcoholism.",N/A
810336,"Something of a `Where are they now?' documentary profiling members of the radical group the Weather Underground three decades on.  A splinter group of the SDS (Students for a Democratic Society,) the Weatherman, as one interviewee notes, `stole' the student left from SDS at an acrimonious convention held in the late 1960s. Affirming an affinity with liberation movements across the globe - revolution was `in' back then, - identifying strongly with the Black Panthers, and in violent opposition to the Vietnam War, the Weathermen preached active resistance against America's `white imperialist' actions at home and abroad.Although director Bill Siegel must have sympathized with the subject, the graying radicals, neither the film nor his commentary track betrays an overbearing bias.  The film moves, sometimes confusingly, from the SDS convention to the Days of Rage in Chicago in 1969, the Weathermen's first public protest that degenerated into a bat-wielding riot.  Then it's on to a townhouse bombing where three Weathermen were killed when a bomb they were building to use at a military dance exploded prematurely.  More bombing followed the townhouse bombing, although the ex-members, who went underground at that point, stress often that the bombings were symbolic actions only.  No one was killed, they claim, and targets were carefully chosen.  Police stations when a Black Panther was killed, State Department buildings in response to atrocities in Vietnam. Siegel strings together archive film, old newscasts, and the like to tell the story.  Interspersed are talking-head interviews with surviving Weather Underground members.  Visually it's all a little static.  I've watched this film three times in the last week or so.  There are two commentary tracks, one with director Siegel, the other with original Weather Underground members Bernardine Dohrn and Bill Ayers. I don't think it could have been cut much better, but with so many talking heads and footage shot from the inside of a moving car at an anonymous landscape, well, the eye starts to starve a bit.THE WEATHER UNDERGROUND confronts us with an issue that is still with us and probably always will be.  What are your responsibilities when confronted with what you believe is injustice? Is, as one ex-member asks at one point in the movie, doing nothing in the face of violence an act of violence itself? The brilliant thing about this movie is that it is open to many valid responses - you can view the Weathermen as committed idealists willing to risk their lives for social justice, or young, white children of privilege intoxicated with their own sense of moral righteousness and willing to bomb themselves, along with the whole anti-war movement, to the margins with their outrageous behavior. Some documentaries invite you to stroll down Memory Lane.  THE WEATHER UNDERGROUND marches you through a nightmare battleground.  The questions it raises about social action and responsibility are as valid now as they were thirty plus years ago.",The Weather Underground

669784,"I have already done individual reviews of the two practices contained in this DVD but I wanted to give an overview of the combined practices found on this excellent DVD.By way of background, I have been practicing Yoga daily for over 9 years, with a large library of yoga VHS/DVD/CD (around 100). I also have been studying for many years with an excellent Yoga teacher, but that's only once a week so the heart of my Yoga practice is at home w/ my collection of Various Yoga media.This DVD contains two practices, led by Yoga teacher Sara Ivanhoe, and is an excellent pair of routines. The first, ""Joy of Yoga"" is more basic, a good introduction to Yoga. The second,""Fat Burning Yoga"" has more of a Vinyasa flow style to it (more of a ""Power Yoga"" feel). It is a challenging but doable program that is around 40 or so minutes long.I feel that Sara particularly shines as a teacher in the second (""Fat Burning"") program, but of course that may just be personal preference because I tend to like those more challenging, flowing types of practice which really build heat in the body.I want to say a bit more about the ""Fat Burning"" program.The routine is extremely well put together. The poses build gradually starting with simpler movements that warm you up and gently take you into the more challenging versions of the poses from one series to the next.She has a student who demonstrates modifications which is always quite important for a program like this where you may have a person who has never done yoga before or who may have physical limitations.This is a very thorough routine which leads you through a wide range of motion and also incorporates a really wonderful flow.My only miniscule complaint would be that I prefer a longer guided relaxation before the final seated pose, but of course one can always just shut off the program to extend their relaxation and then put it back on to finish it off in sitting. This in and of itself wasn't a big deal because there is still at least some semblence of relaxation (which is treated gratuitously in many programs).Highly recommended!Namaste",Crunch - The Perfect Yoga Workout: The Joy of Yoga & Fat-Burning Yoga
481638,"UPDATE ON WHERE TO VIEW THIS SERIESFYI It has been posted on (...) in it's typically user posted low resolution but it is watchable andbetter then watching it full of TV commercials per episode. IMHO. This series is really hard to find evena copied set, but if you Google it you will find sets for (...).This is one of best war documentaries ever made (I place it tied or at least close to ""The World At War""). I would seriously think of purchasing it because it's being shown in chopped up episodes full of commercials on TV now. Why do I think it's so good? It was made just 5 years after the end of the American involvement so all the major characters were still alive to be interviewed. The Vietnam War was the most filmed war ever to that time so the documentary is able to take advantage of all the film (mostly in color). Lastly, Richard Basehart's narrative voice is as distinguished as James Earl Jones. I never perceived a bias politically on the series, (I lean heavily to the right on foreign affairs), and I think although the war was a tactical loss, it helped win the cold war so it was a strategic win (the east could not provide the basic necessities of life while competing with the west's war machine output). Still, just reading now that Peter Arnett wrote this series makes me pause, but if any war deserved Peter Arnett's input I guess this one would. Maybe it's not being re-released because Arnett has ""jumped the shark"" and has been totally discredited as an objective journalist. It's a shame because there isn't anything on the Vietnam War that comes close to this series quality and historical reference.

The story is engaging, whether or not you believe it and are willing to just enjoy it as a story, and everything moves along at an exciting and thrilling pace. I thought that it would make a perfect movie, and I still believe it COULD.However, the movie was, in my opinion, a disaster. Although the plot follows very closely with the book, it's just not very fun to watch. Everything about it feels rushed, and it felt like they filmed it in two days. The pacing is terrible - the rushed feeling does not contribute to the ""thriller"" aspect of it, it just feels like they didn't care about making a good movie. The acting is also quite horrendous. Tom Hanks usually does a great job, but he was an awful choice for this movie. He is to old for the part, and did not feel genuine in his performance. The directing is below average. The effects are pretty decent. In fact, the only things that were well done.I'm rating the movie three stars because it did not feel like a TOTAL waste of time. It does compliment the book, but by itself it is simply not worth watching, especially for $20. While watching in theaters I was only intrigued by the story, as I had forgotten a lot since reading the book and it refreshed my memory. The ending was also a little better than the book in concept, but the bad acting and directing still applied.If you're interested in this film, please do yourself a favor and rent it first. If you like it enough, buy it. Otherwise, you could just read the book and hope that another version will be released in a few years that's done better.",N/A
229916,"Sam Pecknpah followed his extremely violent and critically acclaimed 'The Wild Bunch' with the even more violent 'Straw Dogs', which didn't sit as well with the critics; in fact, 'Straw Dogs' was shocking enough to be banned in the UK where it was filmed, although in the US it was released with an X rating. Critics attacked it as being overtly violent and sexual, and entirely missed the message Peckinpah was making. Three and a half decades later, though, it's easier to appreciate 'Straw Dogs' for the groundbreaking creation that it was, and its influence can clearly be seen in the works of such contemporary directors as David Fincher, David Lynch and Todd Solondz, among others.With hindsight, it's hard to miss the fact that the sexual and violent content of 'Straw Dogs' isn't a whole lot more shocking than that of Kubrick's 'A Clockwork Orange', released that very same month. 'A Clockwork Orange' also created its own share of controversy, of course; yet somehow it was more rapidly recognized as the masterpiece it is by critics than 'Straw Dogs'. In part, I think that's due to the fact that while 'A Clockwork Orange' is an ultra-violent surreal fantasy from its very beginning, 'Straw Dogs' seems entirely innocent at first, like a very realistic and light-hearted drama, and the violence builds gradually throughout the film. That sense of realism, which 'A Clockwork Orange' never pretends to, makes 'Straw Dogs' much more difficult to take as an analogy; it cries out to be taken at face value, which makes it much more difficult to swallow.Dustin Hoffman was never an actor to fear controversy, and 'Straw Dogs' catches him right at the peak of his best years as an actor, after 'The Graduate', 'Midnight Cowboy' and 'Little Big Man', and before 'Lenny', 'Papillon' and 'All The President's Men'. His performance is as amazing as in any of these, and again Hoffman proves his rare range, as well as his sensitivity; his performance carries the film to true excellence, and perhaps that's the other reason that the film was a bit more difficult to take than 'A Clockwork Orange' - to take nothing away from the wonderful Malcolm McDowell, what 'A Clockwork Orange' simply didn't have was a protagonist for the viewer to identify with, and therefore, like I stated before, it was easier to take as an analogy, and Alex functioned more as a symbolic and iconic character than as a real human being. David Sumner, on the other hand, is a remarkably realistic and convincing character, and one that is very easy to relate to, which makes the change that comes over him towards the end of the film all the more shocking. Again, it is that building up of tension that makes 'Straw Dogs' such a powerful experience.'Straw Dogs' is a film that creates controversy and disagreements, and so it should. It's easy to create controversy with sex and violence; but many years later that initial shock fades, and the real test is whether or not the film stands the trial of time and still manages to shock and engross. Like 'A Clockwork Orange', 'Straw Dogs' stands that test. Love it or hate it, it's hard to deny that it's an important and influential film, and it's essential viewing for any film lover.",Straw Dogs VHS
264580,"This entertaining western full of atmosphere is one of Robert Mitchum's best. RKO made many great films in different genres and this one crosses boundaries, mixing elements of a standard western with a complex story and film noir undertones.Director Robert Wise used rain and some moody lighting in some scenes to give a different feel to this oater. The script by Lillie Hayward is more complex than many westerns and Roy Webb's typically fine score give this one a unique mood and feel.Mitchum is Jim Garry, a rider supposedly just passing through who in truth has been brought in as a hired gun by his old pal Riley (Robert Preston) to take over the huge herd of a man named Lutton and get rich. It is a complicated scheme involving army beef and Riley's duping of homesteaders into believing they are fighting Sutton to save their land.But the methods of Garry's old pal leave a bad taste in his mouth which completely turns sour because of the sudden belief shown in him by Sutton's spunky daughter, Amy (Barbara Bel Geddes). Garry also becomes aware that Amy's sister, Carol (Phyllis Thaxter) is being used by Riley for information. Coupled with Garry's liking of Kris Bardin (Walter Brennan) and his regret that the widower loses his remaining son during the fallout, Amy's goodness begins to show on Jim, and it isn't long before a showdown with Riley and his other gunman is on the horizon.Despite its noir undertones, this is a subtle and intelligent film in many ways. Amy's sensing the man inside Gary, and how she easily sees his shame and regret at most of his life is quite telling. A conversation between the two, when she gives him the revelation that he will be lost forever if he walks away from the fight, simply because no one believes in him, seems like a scene from a deeper and more complex film than a western.There is a great ending involving a crusty Brennan, an injured Mitchum, and Amy pitted against Riley and his gunman. Both Bel Gedes and Phyllis Thaxter are excellent here. Mitchum is, well, Mitchum, which is about all you could want in a film such as this. This is a fine oater with a nice and old-fashioned romance and a good story with a bit of a noir atmosphere. A must for Mitchum fans.",Blood on the Moon VHS

The DVD focuses on the early part of the French and Indian War, most specifically on little-known, but important, Braddock's Defeat. Within this time frame, we follow George Washington and learn of his many mistakes and watch him grow as a leader. We see how Washington gained valuable experience in leadership and warfare that would serve him as leader of the Revolutionary forces. I was also interested to hear of the various native tribes as participants in the war with their own geo-political goals and aspirations and not just as pawns of the British or French.The presentation is great and the information is interesting and important for an understanding of early American history. There are pictures, reenactments, and comments from scholars and historians. I was happy to see that a British historian was included. I give this documentary my highest recommendation.",N/A

Back then, it looked sleek, chic, exciting, everything you could ask for from a tv show...just like Charlie's Angels... or Vega$... I remember them all...Almost 30 years later, it looks so dated... so different from today's fast paced, violent, end-twisting, loud, in-your-face TV.STILL we love it. The stories are so simple... and Wagner and Powers had so much charm... so much style.Let me add that today I guess I still secretly dream about having a 1978 Mercedes-Benz yellow wagon with that big telephone (laughs). It used to be so super cool!!!Wathing those episodes made me feel again like a 6 year-old kid just being introduced to late 70's television - the jokes, the kitchens, the hairdos, the telephones, VCRs, big cars, disco...Oh, and I loved Mark Snow's theme. I recognized it instantly...And Max's introduction to Mr. and Mrs. H... whose hobby is murder!!!Do you want to know what were the dreams of the middle class' during the late 70's? Watch Hart to Hart.

386854,"Rodgers and Hammerstein's musical State Fair, while often falling under the radar compared to their more popular shows such as ""Sound of Music"" or ""Oklahoma,"" is still one of the sweetest, cutest musicals ever.  The movie follows the Frake family, an average farm family in Iowa, as they prepare to go to their state's big summer fair.  Melissa and Abel (Ma and Pa) want to win prizes; son Wayne wants to get even with a fair worker; and daughter Margy wants some excitement to happen in her otherwise mundane life.While at the fair, the whole family experiences the emotional highs and lows of anticipation, hoping for something, and (for the siblings) falling in love.State Fair stands out to me because the music is just gorgeous.  With classic ballads such as ""It Might as Well be Spring"" and the big band number ""That's For Me,"" there's no way you could forget the musical numbers in this production.Now, while I absolutely loved the 1945 version, I can't say the same for the 1962 version.  I had never seen it before buying this DVD, but I thought it lacked the beauty of the original movie.  The 1962 version focuses more on the Emily/Wayne relationship, and I wasn't too impressed with the added musical numbers.  Margy seemed rather bland, and her love interest (renamed Jerry, and now a TV reporter to modernize his role) struck me as sleazy and somewhat of a jurk.  I spent the whole movie wondering how she could ever like him.While I don't like the 1962 version at all, I do think it was a great idea for both versions to be packaged together for the Anniversary Edition.  It's a cool collector's item, but the 1945 version is definitely the reason to buy this set.",State Fair VHS

642390,"Three college students (played by Jay Hernandez, Derek Richardson and Eythor Gudjonsson) decide to backpack across Europe. They have no idea what lies in wait. When they meet an older man on the train, they're told about a village where women will do anything to satisfy a man--especially Americans. Checking into a hostel in Slovakia, the three men discover that their room comes with a few perks. Three gorgeous women. And this of course leads to one thing.Most of the first half of the film is filled with the gratuitous sexual encounters so prevalent in today's horror movies; however, since it's actually a key part of the story line, I guess they had to do it. (No pun intended.) The women are bait. And once the men are lured in, they're drugged and find themselves in a terrifying predicament.As a longtime fan of horror movies, I felt there was extreme shock value in the gross chopping, drilling and slicing of human flesh. It made me cringe and turn away at times, and I have a strong stomach. It isn't a psychological thriller or ghostly horror, so much as a movie that tests your limits on what you can visually handle seeing.The final explanation of what's actually going on is perhaps what sets this film apart from other random slasher films. In fact, it's the `hunt club' aspect that makes the story line more believable and even, dare I say, feasible. Yet instead of hunting down victims, wealthy men can torture, maim or murder in order to satisfy their sadistic needs. And as a subtle humorous dig, it's the Americans who are most prized. For what better way to get back at the US than to torture and kill future generations? The shocking violence of the group of children that appears occasionally also sends a strong message. If you travel to a foreign country, it's a good thing to carry gum and candy!At least the acting in Hostel was a far cry from the poor readings of the actors in the movie Saw--a movie that made me groan and sigh, wishing I could have written their dialogue and had my neighbors act it out.Unlike many of today's horror films, Hostel does leave you with a vaguely fulfilling ending. Of course, you'll just have to see it now to find out what that is. This is the perfect dieter's movie too, by the way. You won't be too hungry or thirsty while you're watching it. This movie is definitely for 18+!!!If you enjoy a movie that makes you gasp, cringe or has your stomach churning, this is it. If you can't handle blood, excessive gore and brutality, I'd recommend you watch a comedy instead. Now...where did I put my saw? :)~ Cheryl Kaye TardifAuthor of Divine Intervention",Hostel
29906,"SPAWN is one of the few comic book adaptations that actually looks and feels like a comic book.  Todd McFarlane's immensely successful graphic books is brought to the screen with exciting action sequences and mindblowing special effects, except for the head demon who looks like a refuge from Sesame Street.  Otherwise, the fx are great.  The story is pretty simple:  a CIA operative is betrayed by his boss and dies a fiery death.  He is sent to hell where he agrees to return to lead Satan's army if he can see his girlfriend, Wanda.  Five years have passed though and Wanda is now married to Spawn's best friend and they have a daughter.

986652,"I have seen all of Tyler Perry's movies and plays, but this is by far the funniest (and best) one.  I can only think of a few cons and a whole gang of pros.Cons:  I thought Tyler was a little rough on Chico and I didn't care for the man putting his hands around her neck (during the Behind the Scenes rehearsal).  I wonder how she felt about that, but it bothered me quite a bit.  The wigs are still horrendous, but I know they save time. Who in the world made Chico's tear tattoos though?  I've seen a bunch of tear tattoos growing up and they've always been little, but somebody put tears so big on her face that it looked more like a wet marker.  I don't know what was on that lady's bird who sang the song at the end but all that oversinging was driving me insane--she started making this short, yelping noise that sounded like a gun going off and I wanted to pause the DVD and duck down for cover.  She made this loud ""yiddiddidd"" noise and then a bunch of ""yay-e-yay-uhs""...it was terrible. That song should've ended before she started impersonating weapons.Pros:  Let's have a moment of appreciation for Mr. Ryan Gentles and Mr. Christian Keyes, because those two men will have you lose your breath more than Destiny's Child. I really hate pick-up lines and I'm deadset against sweating anybody, but THOSE two are the the dudes that you have to stop, look at your homegirl, and go ""Did you just see THEM?""  Wow!  That's all I can say.  I thought Ryan was absolutely the finest man ever with dreads...whoa.  Ron Andrews playing ""Pete the Pimp"" was a cutie pie too, but I thought he was older than he really was until I saw Behind the Scenes.But on to the movie.  This movie was incredibly hilarious.  Madea going to jail is just scary in general, but I really dug the lessons she tried to express in regards to women who have children but are in jail; the foster care system; officers raping women prisoners; violence in men's prisons; violence in women's prisons; betrayal; cheating; friendship; sexual responsibility; and street life *singing* ""You know it's hard out here for a pimp.""  The movie was excellent all around. I was too ecstatic when Tyler actually SANG several times during this movie and then broke character to talk about playalistics and people who come in and out of your life for their own intentions.  I couldn't agree more with the tree analogy.I'm trying to figure out what I liked more--the behind-the-scenes shot when Ryan growled at the camera or the movie...but that's a tough one.I'd recommend it to anyone breathing--go see it today!  It took me about four hours to get through the movie because I just kept rewinding scenes and falling out laughing again. ""Sonny"" cracked a joke with Pepsi about ""ac'in"" and I cracked up and saw that he had the potential to be funny as well and Pepsi was crazy as usual.  I really like her singing voice and her comedy, as well as Leo the Lion.  My favorite part of the whole movie was the ""Old School"" scene. I couldn't get enough of that and this movie.

You appreciate the depth of Cortesa's work here because she plays a flawed character, a Polish refugee who assumes the identity of a wealthy heiress who died in the concentration camps.

906036,"In My Country helped me fully comprehend the tragic mistake of Nelson Mandela and the African National Congress in refusing to renounce terrorism.  There is little doubt but that their embrace of bloody Marxist-Leninist principles unwittingly extended the existence of the apartheid South African government for at least a few more decades.  The movie deals with the Truth and Reconciliation Commission's attempt to reconcile the divisions within the white and black communities.  Both sides are guilty of horrifying atrocities.  Apartheid may no longer be the law of the land---but will love and forgiveness instead of revenge bring everybody together?  How could generally decent people do such horrible things to other human beings?Amnesty will be granted only to those willing to publicly tell the truth.  An Afro-American journalist is sent by the Washington Post to report on these hearings.  He is something of a bigot for he mostly blames whites for all the violence.  Conveniently, the murders and torturing of whites by blacks are ignored.  An illicit romantic relationship develops between himself and an Afrikaner woman who has a far more balanced perspective about the past horrors.Brendan Gleeson is superb as the vile South African military officer who seemingly enjoyed sadistically victimizing suspected black terrorists.  However, one soon realizes that he and other whites rationalized away their behavior because of the commitment to violence by Nelson Mandela and the ANC.  They should have not been provided with this excuse.  It only worsened an already bad situation.  The nonviolent policies of Martin Luther King and Mahatma Gandhi would have accomplished so much more.  In My Country is thought provoking.  This may not be a five star film, but it is still well worth a few hours of your time.David ThomsonFlares into Darkness",In My Country
632439,"""Proof"" is based on the play by David Auburn, who contributed screenwriting skills as well. The film was directed by John Madden, who previously directed Gwyneth Paltrow in a successful run of the play in London. So both Madden and Paltrow come to the film with a lot of experience. They are joined by a superb film cast, most notably Hope Davis, in bringing this intriguing story of family and identity that revolves around an important mathematical proof to the screen. Catherine (Gwyneth Paltrow) is the daughter of a brilliant mathematician (Anthony Hopkins) who struggled with mental illness. Catherine is very much like her father, so much that it scares her, and was very close to him. She gave up 5 years of her life to take care of him when he was overcome by psychosis. Now her father is dead, and Catherine's fastidious, controlling sister Claire (Hope Davis), has arrived to put everything in order and take control of Catherine's life, which she fears is heading off the deep end. A former student of their father's, Harold (Jake Gyllenhaal), is determined to look at every piece of gibberish the great man wrote in his last years in case any important math found its way through his madness. Catherine relents and leads Harold to the prize: a fantastic proof. But who wrote it?I have only occasionally seen any indication that Gwyneth Paltrow is anything more than a mediocre actress, but those little glimmers of talent were signs of better things to come. Paltrow is very good in this role. Catherine is an intelligent, fragile woman whose outbursts may or may not indicate instability, but who has consciously chosen to deny her nature, even to herself. From the outside, she is an unnerving enigma. From the inside, she suffered tremendously for her father's madness. Director John Madden presents this story as dual narratives: The subjective past, which we see through Catherine's memories, is alternated with the objective present. This is very effective. Clues to the film's 2 mysteries, Catherine's character and the proof's authorship, are found in the past, which unfolds simultaneously with the present narrative that focuses on Catherine's changing relationships with Claire and Harold. I applaud Madden's decision to use a steadicam to impart a sense of realism and immediacy. It works nicely, and it's a whole lot better than a shaky handheld. ""Proof"" is a thoroughly enjoyable film whose characters always have something interesting going on in their minds. Its talkiness betrays its theatrical roots, but Madden has done such a good job of placing the action in natural settings that I was rarely aware of the film's theatricality.The DVD (Buena Vista/Miramax 2006): Bonus features are a making-of documentary, 2 deleted and 1 extended scene with optional director's commentary (7 min), and an audio commentary. ""From Stage to Screen: The Making of Proof"" (10 min) includes interviews with director John Madden, producers, and cast who discuss the characters and adapting the play to film. There is a good audio commentary in which John Madden contributes a lot of analysis of the narrative structure and characters, taking us through Catherine's thoughts and emotions, as well as discussing themes, visual style, dialogue, and directorial decisions.

It wasn't always that way, however, as journalist Peter Jennings illustrates in this fascinating exploration of early Christian beliefs. The teachings of Christianity can be traced back to Jesus and Paul, who set down some of the fundamental beliefs in their brief tenure on the planet. Focusing largely on Paul, Jennings shows how he set the religion apart from Judaism, the possible negative effects he had, and how he interacted with Jesus and his family.

So much is still VERY relevant today, and it's fun to remember ""being a kid"". Sure, it has ""Golly, Gee Whiz"" moments, but that just adds to its charm. And what's wrong with just being entertained without violence, bad talk, and trash? Try it, you'll almost surely like it!",N/A

758112,"A lot of spurious cinematographic tricks (reversed narrative line, constantly spinning camera, etc., serving no purpose whatsoever other than temporary mystification of the rapidly losing interest viewer) and showy violence trying to hide an utmost absence of any idea.

Needless to say after getting an HD DVD player I was excited to pick this up, and check it out. The results unfortunately are mixed. The principal photography of the movie has an excellent HD DVD transfer, tons of detail so much in fact I was rather amused to clearly see the lines between the physical sets and the painted backdrops!Ok so now the bad part. Any shots that feature FX work by Disney (laser fx, the ID monster etc) are all blurry. They look like standard DVD definition compared to the HD DVD footage that surrounds them. You see quite a pop when the image cuts from fx footage to on set photography. The image sharply gets more detailed, or swapping to FX less detailed. Its a shame WB couldn't really do this special edition the justice it deserves by getting the quality consistent all through the movie.The movie has lots of great extras, but the mix and match nature of the image quality sadly hurts the overall presentation.",N/A

988797,"Other reviewers have described the plot, so I will skip that part.  First - I am a big Vin Diesel fan.  The story starts out with some action but quickly mires in a courtroom setting.  I had nothing invested in these characters.  You like Vin's character because he is funny and has some angst going on.  But how they got to this landmark case and why - all back story.I think this story would have been better told in a mini-series format.  (But then the A- list people wouldn't have done it).  The first 2 hours would be showing us their dirty dealings and then subsequent arrest.  The 2nd two hours could have been the trial.As much as I like ""talking"" films - those with dialogue and not a lot of action - this one just didn't deliver.

202366,"I read all 55 reviews of this movie and I noticed that some felt that the movie fell far short of the Peter Straub book.I beg to differ.The book was excellent, up until he went into this ""shape shifter - changeling"" diatribe to explain the origins of Eva Galley. Up to that point in the book it was rivetting, scary, really excellent as the reviewers said. But the shape shifting nonsense ruined the book, in my opinion.The movie dispensed with the shape shifer ""explanation"" of the ghost - it was left completely out, and you had no idea what the origin of Eva Galley was. In fact, from the movie you dont know who she was in the first place when the boys first met her - she was as mysterious then as she ended up being as a ghost. No explanations were offered and none were needed.Alice Krige was indeed the star of the show and her performance was perfect.

Of all the first rate acting in this film, it is Gillian Anderson that stands out, she is mesmerizing as Lady Dedlock, you can feel her misery and resignation of being trapped in a life that is taking her soul.  I also found the ambiguousness of her relationships with her ladies in waiting to be quite erotic.  This film will have you on the edge of your seat and you will have to know the ending, but do yourself a favor and don't cheat and find out how it all ends, just sit back and enjoy the ride, and after all this is Dickens, you should have some idea of how it will all end, if not just ask Pip.",N/A
1030070,"In this clever, over-the-top satire of daytime soap operas, ""The Young, The Gay and The Restless"" (2006) especially pokes fun at the current trend of including gay characters in such shows, by providing a storyline where everyone seems to be gay, married to someone gay, flirting with someone gay, or contemplating murdering a gay character. And, like actual daytime ""soaps"", there's several plots going on simultaneously, as well as instances of cheating spouses, sexual predators, longtime grudges, incest, sluts, suicide, jealousy, gold-digging relatives worried about their inheritance, a secret past criminal record, and even a bisexual foursome as a bit of icing on the cake.In charge of this extended dysfunctional family is elderly but feisty and rich matriarch Victoria Gaylord, who brings everyone together for her birthday celebration, which is cut short when she has a fainting spell. Her husband, Francis (who has some skeletons in the closet as well), calls Dr. Bender who arrives on scene and proceeds to argue with Francis about who has her best interests in mind.  Daughter Cynthia arrives at the party late with her husband Phillip, who is concerned that his wife is a bit TOO close to one of her brothers, and is also afraid of being ""hit on"" by gay brother Nicholas.  Meanwhile, flirty gay houseboy Andrew is juggling a couple of prospective future as well as one former boyfriend, all of whom show up to court him, as does a young lady who wants to be Andrew's ""try it once"" woman.  Dr. Bender's sassy assistant, Nurse Jones, arrives last, but her treatment plan for Victoria isn't exactly what others had in mind.A well-written, campy, tacky, sarcastic, (intentionally and brilliantly) overacted and hillarious treat, not to be missed!  The only negative is a technical gaffe:  the background music is way too loud, and sometimes drowns out the dialogue.  But I can't hold that important enough to give this creative confection less than a full five stars out of five!  DVD has no extras, other than chapter stops.",N/A

226915,"The Entity (1981), a fictionalized account based on a `true' incident, relates a tale of how a single mother in California suffered brutal attacks by unseen forces.  Taken from the popular novel by Frank De Felitta and directed by Sidney J. Furie (The Ipcress File, Iron Eagle, Superman IV: The Quest for Peace), the film stars Barbara Hershey (Hoosiers, Tin Men).  Also appearing is Ron Silver (Silkwood), George Coe (The Omega Code), Margaret Blye (Mischief), Jacqueline Brookes (Ghost Story), Richard Brestoff (The Man with Two Brains), Raymond Singer (Feds), Alex `Moe Green' Rocco (The Godfather), Natasha Ryan (The Amityville Horror), Melanie Gaffin (Armed and Dangerous), and David Labiosa, whom many may be familiar with from his appearance as the character of Antonio the busboy from the ""Seinfeld"" episode The Busboy.Carla Moran (Hershey) is a single mother, who works during the day and goes to school at night, drives a funky car and lives in a funky rental house with her three children.  After returning home one night she suffers a brutal, penetrating attack by an unseen aggressor, one that's real enough to her to believe her attacker is a corporeal being in the house (he's not).  Her oldest son Bill (Labiosa) writes it off as a bad dream, but the amorous, groping, invisible entity soon returns on a regular basis causing Carla to think she possibly losing her marbles, to which she seeks professional help from a psychiatrist named Dr. Sneiderman (Silver).  As Sneiderman begins probing Carla's background he believes the attacks are all apart of some delusion, stemming from her sketchy past, but the incidents continue and grow in intensity, eventually witnessed by others around Carla, including her children (at one point she suffers various bruises and bite marks upon her body).  Eventually a disillusioned Carla, after a falling out with Sneiderman, comes into contact with a couple of university funded parapsychologists named Gene (Brestoff) and Joe (Singer) who later witness some of the strangeness, and they agree to get involved not only to document the powerful force but to also help Carla, much to Dr. Sneiderman annoyance who thinks such intervention by those he presumes quacks will only feed the delusion.  Anyway, as the unusual activity continues the parapsychologists look for a way to isolate and immobilize the force, resulting in a grand and elaborate experiment in a university gymnasium where they use a willing Carla as the bait (once Sneiderman gets wind of what's going on, he flips his proverbial lid and tries to intervene), the hope being to capture that force which they believe to have crossed over from another plane of existence (apparently looking for a good time).I'm not a big believer in the supernatural but I am perfectly willing to admit there's a lot of stuff going on out there that we, for some reason or another, just can't explain.  Whether or not part or most of what's relating in this film actually occurred I do not know, but it certainly made for an interesting and unnerving film, especially if you like well developed ghost stories with an intellectual slant.  I thought Ms. Hershey did a really wonderful job portraying a woman fighting to keep her wits, struggling to come to terms with those who would have her believe her very real experiences were all just a product of her fractured mind.  One aspect of the film I really enjoyed was the animosity displayed between the established medical community, represented by Dr. Sneiderman, and the pseudo science of the paranormal, represented mainly by Gene and Joe, whom, by the way, were a real couple of nerdlingers (check out the scene when they're in Carla's bedroom and some static electricity appears in the air...the both dive for the floor in fright).  There's one sort of funny scene when Sneiderman's in a staff meeting with his peers with Carla present, and after she leaves nearly everyone lights up (one guy's smoking a pipe, another a cigar, and most of the rest pull out cigarettes).  I'm not entirely sure why I found this humorous, but perhaps it has something to do with seeing all these medical professionals engaging in an activity we now know to be detrimental to one's health.  Anyway, I thought the film, which ran just over two hours, was pretty solid all the way around, including the flow of the story, the special effects (which were understated enough to appear real), the performances, and the direction.  Furie and his cinematographer Stephen H. Burum (The Untouchables, Mission: Impossible) did employ some interesting camera slanted angle shots and tight close ups, most likely to create a heightened sense of tension, and they usually worked, on me at least.  As I said the film runs just over two hours, and I thought the time was used well.  The only element I thought a little off was the ending, during the grand experiment meant to try and capture the entity.  I won't go into specifics but despite not being familiar with the source material, I highly doubt this `Ghostbusters' sequence was something that actually took place.  Most likely it was a spectacular element tacked on to the film in an effort to provide a whiz-bang of a finale.  It was interesting, but it felt at odds with the rest of the story in terms of up until that point there felt a certain sense of disturbing realism steeped in the fantastic, whereas the ending moved into the realm of the ultra fantastic.  I did like their train of thought in as far as how they were planning to capture the entity, but, again, it didn't seem to fit well with everything that occurred previously given most of what's depicted is supposedly culled from actual events.  That's not to say the ending ruined the film, but only that it takes away slightly from everything else that came before.The picture on this Anchor Bay Entertainment DVD release, presented in widescreen (2.35:1), enhanced for 16X9 TVs, looks very sharp and clean, and the Dolby Digital 2.0 Surround comes through very well.  Extras include a newly created and entertaining documentary titled The Entity Files (27:28) featuring a real life parapsychologist named Dr. Barry Taff who shares some of his experiences (he was involved in the true life events from which provide the basis of the film), a theatrical trailer, a poster and still gallery, and an original screenplay accessible as a DVD-ROM feature.Cookieman108By the way, I saw on the Internet Movie Database website there's a remake of this film in the works, tentatively scheduled for a 2008 release.

They engaged in what Prof. Lee Harris calls ""fantasy ideology""."" . . . It is a common human weakness to wish to make more of our contribution to the world than the world is prepared to acknowledge, and it is our fantasy world that allows us to fill this gap. But normally, for most of us at least, this fantasy world stays relatively hidden. Indeed, a common criterion of our mental health is the extent to which we are able to keep our fantasies firmly under our watchful control . . . Yet clearly there are individuals for whom this control is, at best, intermittent, resulting in behavior that ranges from the merely obnoxious to the clinically psychotic. The man who insists on being taken more seriously than his advantages warrant falls into the former category; the maniac who murders an utter stranger because God - or his neighbor's dog - commanded him to do so belongs to the latter.""""Al Qaeda's Fantasy Ideology"", By Lee Harris[...]In his article, he relates a ""personal recollection"" of first encountering this type of fantasy while having an argument with his college roommate over how to conduct their  anti-Vietnam War protest.

636742,"Based on a skit he wrote years ago at Second City, Carell plays Andy Stitzer who lives a serene existence amongst his collection of unopened toys (an obvious metaphor which takes on greater significance as the story progresses) and working in the repair department of an electronics store. Since he keeps to himself, his co-workers assume he may be keeping heads in the fridge, but David (Paul Rudd) invites him to a late night poker game with Cal (Seth Rogen) and Jay (Romany Malco) and when it comes time to share sex stories, Andy gives his inexperience away.Shocked by how a grown man could go forty years without even doing it by accident, his fellow workers are amused but probably deep down grateful that they now have a project to distract them from their own problem-plagued existence. All the advice in the world can't ease a man who has already found his comfort zone and isn't even sure anymore if sex is such a big deal. That is until Trish (Catherine Keener) walks into the store, a mother-of-three who went through her wild phase years ago and isn't exactly looking for a man, but senses a kindness about Andy that immediately gets him digits.To describe a film like this solely on a plot structure is to suck the deafening laughs right out of it. But to go further into depth would be to ruin one gut-busting dialogue sequence or set piece after another. As quotable films go, The 40-Year Old Virgin boasts four characters who behave and talk like the atypical male. Not exemplified like the teet-lovin' pigs women talk about nor the pussified versions that romantic comedies use to suck women into the theater. These are men. Real men. Funny, flawed, horny and lovingly identifiable to both sexes.It was nearly ten years ago since we had characters as perfectly realized as Andy, David, Cal and Jay when 1996 brought us both Beautiful Girls and Swingers. Beyond their reaction to and faux knowledge of the opposite sex, you could watch the video game scene in Swingers and know this was happening somewhere in town, maybe with even guys we know. That small moment of brilliance is eclipsed in 2005 when David & Cal engage in a discussion over how each knows the other is gay which Cal puts the capper on by using his game warrior to provide the exclamation point. It is asides like this in The 40-Year Old Virgin which catapult it past posers like Wedding Crashers and will endure it as a comedy classic.If Apatow continues to churn out brilliance like this, his repertoire will soon be inheriting the accolades that Christopher Guest's receive on their feature-length improvs. (Jane Lynch has been borrowed from Guest and her unforced oddness gets us anticipating laughs which she pays off beautifully.) Apatow has brought with him folks from two of the most unjustly cancelled creations in TV history (Freaks and Geeks & Undeclared), most notably Rogen who, in my eye, is one of the funniest talents on the planet who should be finding steady work along the lines of Vince Vaughn and Jeremy Piven. Carell's Anchorman partner-in-crime, Paul Rudd, also continues to come into his own as one of the great untapped comic talents. His steady decline from stable nice guy to the wounded forsaken who has finally given up produces laughs even while we're concentrating on other laughs. And I had never seen Romany Malco before, but to come out of the blue and hold his own with the likes of this cast is a praise beyond measure. Special props is also due to the Elizabeth Banks who enhances her scenes with Carell by playing the good sport and trying to match his unbeknownst come-ons with a extra dose of sexiness.Carell for the past five years has been stealing major laughs away from Jon Stewart, Jim Carrey and Will Ferrell and recently took on the uneviable task of updating one of the best television series I have ever seen (Ricky Gervais' The Office) and turning it into a worthy successor. The brash, occasionally screaming Carell could wear thin over the years, but in Andy he finds not the naivety of a child that would be the easy way out for an actor to approach this role, but a sweetness bridging innocence and pestered solitude. Never do we doubt his plight or how he fell into it and we completely accept Keener's interest in him and the approach she takes to their relationship transforming him slowly from a boy in flux into a man with a different kind of happy ending. It's so great to see Keener not forced into her typical bitch role and allowed the chance to play a mature, sexy woman.Maturity comes with the playing field as Apatow and players have crafted an adult comedy worthy of the definition beyond MPAA age limits. It's not above the occasional cheap joke but counters it with some of the smartest and most off-the-wall pop cultural riffs in its dialogue that even those of us who identify them immediately still must blink twice that we actually heard someone in a mainstream comedy speak them. Comedies of this caliber don't come along too often. We're so desperate for them that we'll support wannabes like Wedding Crashers simply because they seem close enough to the real thing. In a world where films like The 40-Year Old Virgin is the great bizarro world version of garbage like Deuce Bigalow: European Gigolo, Wedding Crashers isn't much more than the cinematic equivalent of the Chicago Cubs. On paper it looks good and a lot of people dish out big money day-in and day-out when at the end of the day, it's just not very good. Wedding Crashers is going to gross close to $200 million by the end of its run and if that's the playing field comedy fans want to set, then The 40-Year Old Virgin deserves to outgross Titanic. Let's make it happen.",N/A

754086,"I originally watched Maison Ikkoku from the Arctic Animation fan subtitles sometime in the early 1990's, and I've been in love with it ever since. I think (and many people share this opinion) that Maison is Rumiko Takahashi's best manga and best anime, and that's saying a lot, since Takahashi has penned blockbusters like Ranma, Urusei Yatsura, and Inuyasha.The story is about a boarding house called Ikkoku-kan where a hapless student Yusaku Godai lives, along with a hard-drinking housewife Ichinose-san, her son Kentaro, a bizarre and secretive man Yotsuya-san who is constantly frustrating Godai, and Akemi Roppongi who is a sultry hostess at a local tavern. The tenants of Ikkoku-kan continuously torture Godai: they prevent him from studying, eat all his food, and party all night long.Into this nightmare moves in a new apartment manager, Kyoko Otonashi. She is young and pretty and Godai is instantly infatuated with her. The rest of the series is Godai trying to win the love of Kyoko over Shun Mitaka, a local tennis coach who also is in love with Kyoko. And despite the interference of the Ikkoku-kan residents!It doesn't sound like much to start, and surely this first 12 episode set proceeds slowly, but the storyline is well-developed, and the characters are heartfelt. My friends forced me to watch the first 8 episodes, and after that I was hooked. But I'm guessing that if you're pondering buying this series, then you probably have a good idea about the plot and story and such, and want some technical information.The transfer is excellent. This series aired on TV in the '80's and that's obvious from the animation quality, but the job done on the DVD import is good, probably as good as you could get in Japan. The Japanese audio track is mono because that's how it was broadcast. But it has good sound quality and is very crisp.I hate dubbing, but for the sake of this review, I watched it. I don't like it, but as far as dubs go, it's passable. I would discourage watching the dub though because this show is SO Japanese that it relies a lot on the Japanese language itself.The DVD's have essentially no extras or features. It is just the episodes. It's still a good deal, considering 12 episodes a set for ~$45. There should be a total of 8 sets (96 eps). I own 1-5, and plan on acquiring the rest.My main criticisms of this collection:(1) This series is so very Japanese that you HAVE to explain some things. For example, in the American mind, a ronin is a samurai without a master. In the modern Japanese mind, it's someone who's failed the college entrance exams. This DVD set NEEDS technical notes.(2) The DVD liners are not that useful.(3) The English dialogue loses a lot of intricacies above and beyond simple loss of Japanese. Takahashi is a huge fan of puns and such, and this is all lost. Most notable is the loss of Yotsuya's bad poetry, including numerous attempts at haiku, often coming a syllable short or long.Still, Viz actually did a good job with this, and I'm planning on buying the whole set. But for your sake, here are some technical notes.Numbers:Most of the cast has names with numbers.Otonashi means ""no sound"" in kanji and the ""no"" part would be like zero, or the numberless manager's room.Ichinose - ichi = 1, corresponding to room #1.Nikaido - ni = 2 (he is only in the manga)Mitaka - mi = 3. Mitaka is also a rich district of Tokyo, signifying that the character is well to do, and would never live in a place like Ikkoku-kan, thus room #3 is vacant. It would be like saying Mr Beverly Hills.Yotsuya - yo = 4. As is room #4Godai - go = 5. As in room #5Roppongi - Ro (or roku) = 6. Roppongi is also an entertainment district of Tokyo, signifying her job as a hostess at a bar and her personality. Akemi means red beauty (since she's a red-head).Nanao - nana = 7.Yagami - Ya = 8.Kujo - ku = 9.Chigusa - chi = 1000.A ronin is a term for student who have failed the college entrance exams and are trying to get in, often attending cram schools.A love hotel is a hotel you go with a partner to have sex. It's like a hotel you'd rent a room by the hour. This is because a lot of Japanese households are extended, and you wouldn't have the privacy to be intimate at home.The story is set in 1980's Tokyo and there are some facets worth mentioning. Most people do not own cars. This is a big status symbol for Mitaka. Many homes do not have baths, and so people go to public baths. In the bath, Japanese enjoy soaking in nearly scalding hot water. Trains are the primary mode of long distance travel in Tokyo, so it is often featured in the anime. Despite being a bay city, Tokyo has no beaches per se, and so it is a long trip to go to a beach despite being next to the ocean. Many people in Tokyo have 'home towns' and aren't Tokyo natives (such as Godai). Often, Tokyo natives had a sense of a lack of this 'home town' feeling, and a recurring theme in the storyline is how Ikkoku-kan has a feeling of home.",Maison Ikkoku: Collector's Boxed set - Volume 1

""Protect is a red very a fit of occupation rugby contestant ever, but was closed into because of a certain reason jail. The jail grows the cool love rugby, however born nature Endure. He hires the exclusively those excel the jail that play the rugby, letting them proceeding with prisoners' game."" Yeah, I think Roger Ebert wrote that.** UPDATED SEVERAL MONTHS LATER AFTER SEEING THE CORRECT DVD **The first eight minutes reminded me why I hate Adam Sandler. Actually, I didn't need that long. That's just how long it took to end the drunken party of a sort that only happens (I hope) in Hollywood movies with overworked stereotypes, and the car chase with cops who are overworked stereotypes. And Adam Sandler, himself an overworked stereotype portraying a character who is yet another overworked stereotype. Convinced that this was the only scene he and his peeps felt compelled to splice onto the original movie, all of which happens IN PRISON, I ejected the DVD and got back to it three days later.Segment three begins with Sandler's arrival in prison. However, it isn't a real prison. It only exists in Hollywood movies. It's where they lock up the cliches. I waded through ten more boring minutes of prison guard violence, brutal crotch hits and so-called wisecracks. The movie got better when Chris Rock appeared.""The movie got better when Chris Rock appeared."" I never thought I'd type those words.At last, the movie. What came before was backstory in the original film. I dunno why they felt they had to show it now when they were only going to tell it later, since it was too boring to show. Oh well.When this film got down to the football itself, that's when it got real. This one isn't for the girlie girls, okay? Since there were many NFL players in this film, football is what they know. Kinda surprising the prison wasn't more realistic, though, since many NFL players know that subject as well.I enjoyed the hell out of its juvenile humor in a testosterone-charged way. I appreciate what it has to say about football, prisons, violence, and whatever else it's on about. How brutal was the original? So brutal that this one was less so in spots. They tinkered with a few bits, but in a good way. A homage not a copy, they say. I agree. It's excellent. I'll keep it and watch it again, skipping the first 20 minutes or so, and I'll love the hell out of it. It's a damn shame to think everything else Sandler makes will probably suck like the parts of this movie I'll keep skipping.",N/A

But I do love Ted Levine which is partly the reason I was willing to give the movie the green light. That and John Dahl (writer, director of Red Rock West) also directed this movie...and confession here, I found it at the $[...] bin at wal-mart. Anyhow, to make a long story short, I picked it up and watched it that night.Joy Ride is about Lewis (Paul Walker,) who travels through the countryside to pick up his newly-released-brother-from-jail, Fuller( Steve Zahn) On the way, they stop at a gas station, and Fuller, a very wild and joke happy person has a CB radio installed so that they could keep an eye on traffic cops and have some fun tormenting a certain truck driver. Unbeknowst to the boys, this trucker is a cross between the character from Jeepers Creepers, and a very scary individual. When he finds out that he has become the brunt of the joke, he retaliates by hunting the boys down and trying to kill them and their girlfriend.Ted Levine is the voice of the truck driver (moby dick, memoirs of a geisha, the fast and the furious,) a man who is able to make the word ""CandyCane,"" seem scary. Although we never really get to seem him (be forwarned, the small glimpse we do get is not the real Levine,) just the knowledge that he is out there haunting the roads is enough to make me dread truck drivers for years to come. And the way he handles his big rig, is amazing. Its a cross between a race car and a tricked out army vehicleI shan't give away the ending, but be assured its probally not quite what you where thinking. Although this movie isn't to deep that you probally will be unable to guess plot points or scenes, and although the movie won't be keeping you too near the edge of your seat. It should keep you a few inches from the seat backing. And with a killer soundtrack by Marco Beltrami (I, Robot, Terminator,) this movie should be crowd pleaser.Just remember...CB radios are not always a good idea, especially when Ted Levine is out and about.:)",Joy Ride

This film isn't overly graphic in its depictions of violence and yet it has more genuinely scary moments than all the slasher movies of the last 20 years put together. This movie allows its atmosphere to build suddenly and effectively before unleashing the subtle violence of Michael Myers.",N/A

The '58 concert features Gillespie and saxophonist Sonny Stitt fronting a small combo, each radiating elegance and cool; the 1970 show has Dizzy doubling as bandleader and soloist, leading a 16-piece big band that slips from complex ensemble arrangements to brash, brassy hard bop and into funk, bluesy grooves, with Gillespie blowing each with equal ease. And he looks hella cool at all times.  Great look at this master jazzman, still playing in his prime over a 12-year stretch.",N/A

This version takes place at a film school university. With the best film award at stake, and a murder taking place ( the person who was most likely to win ), everyone becomes a suspect. But now no one is safe. There is some gore which adds to the movie and some suspense. Overall, not a boring movie like many other movies I've seen.

959525,"Townes Van Zandt was a manic-depressive, an alcoholic, and a great songwriter.  He played a guitar and sang his songs, although the best-known versions of the songs are by others: Willie Nelson, Merle Haggard, and Emmylou Harris to name a few. The songs ""Tecumseh Valley, Poncho and Lefty, If I Needed You, and Waiting Around to to Die"" are as good as any you'll find.  Steve Earle, another Texas singer/songwriter, said TVZ was the greatest songwriter in the world.This documentary features TVZ singing many of his songs while we witness his deterioration.  He died at age 52 of complications following a broken hip and (probably) an overdose of alcohol.  Nobody was suprised.  Guy Clark says at his funeral that he ""booked this gig 30 years ago.""  TVZ never made any money nor sold many records, but it's a pretty good guess that people will be singing his songs for the next 100  years.  They're that good.Among the people talking about TVZ in this film are his wives (three), children, and a host of other singers: Kris Kristofferson, Willie, Emmylou, Clark, Earle, and a bunch more.

Too bad McNaughton and the rest from the first flick did not come back for an encore--because now, even if they did, it might be way too late.It's kind of sad, because McNaughton might have had a far bigger/impressive film career if he had.Skip this one.

17854,"I had my first exposure to Monty Python as a very young child, when their shows were first being broadcast in the US in the mid '70s and my folks would watch them.  Then I saw this movie on Cinemax around 1982...and again the following day.  (By the way, Spiny Normal gives it two prickly thumbs up...Dinsdale!)  After which I promptly went out and bought...*dramatic pause*...a SHRUBBERY!! *Dramatic music!*  I laughed, I cried, I wet my pants (well, all right, not really), I did a few Silly Walks.The genius of the Pythons simply cannot be overstated.  Holy Grail was made on a shoestring budget, yet the lads managed to wring the maximum amount of laughs and silliness out of the Arthurian legends to great effect on that budget.  From the use of coconuts to imitate the sound of hoofbeats, to the burning of a witch because she's made of wood and floats on water like a duck (""Cor, she turned me into a newt!"" ""A newt?!"" ""(Long pause)...I got better...""), to Castle Anthrax and lots of good spankings, to the Bridge of Death (""WHAT...is your favourite COLOUR?!"" ""Blue!"" ""Very well, then, off you go.""), there's nary a wrong step here.  The bonus materials are a bit of fun, too; I must add that the subtitles make the lines easier to understand as well.  They make it much easier for you and your friends to spend countless hours quoting the film back and forth at each other...and the lines are VERY quotable.And the general quality of the film in the special edition is greatly improved; the prior DVD release had muddy sound and murky images, and while the film was enjoyable nevertheless, you still felt a little cheated--after all, the DVD is supposed to be an improvement over the old VHS.  With the special edition, it is.  Clearer and brighter both in sound and images, Sony Pictures has finally given this classic film a new lease on life.  And the extra 24 seconds of footage are good for a chuckle or two.",Monty Python and the Holy Grail
935692,"In order to enjoy ""The Perfect Man,"" you have to understand and be receptive to the fact that this is a teeny-bopper movie that is most likely geared toward an audience of 12-year-old girls. If you're okay with that, then you'll probably be able to enjoy this movie at least somewhat. However, if you're very anti-teen-movies, then you should probably sit this one out.Hilary Duff gets top billing in this film over costars Heather Locklear and Chris Noth. Duff plays Holly, a high school student who is forced to deal with a slightly flakey mother, Jean (Locklear). Every time one of Jean's relationships doesn't work out (which happens quite often), she packs up her two daughters and forces them to move across the country in search of a fresh start. Eventually Holly gets sick of all the moving and she decides to put a stop to things once her family gets settled in Brooklyn. With the help of her friend Amy (Vanessa Lengies) and Amy's uncle Ben (Noth), Holly invents a secret admirer for her mother in hopes of boosting her mom's confidence and keep the family grounded in one city for more than a couple of weeks. Holly has to resort to drastic measures to keep her scheme alive and protect Jean's happiness. To make matters more complicated, Holly soon discovers that Ben is actually a perfect match for her mother, but any chance of them getting together has been ruined because of Holly's lies and deception.There are some aspects of the film that really annoyed me. Locklear's character is incredibly wishy-washy and the movie failed to showcase her talents as an actress. Noth's character is charming, but it's a shame that he and Locklear only have about two minutes of screen time together. Also, Holly's seven-year-old sister Zoe is the freakiest little child on the planet and I cringed every time she popped up on the screen. Why did they have to cast such a creepy kid?!Overall, ""The Perfect Man"" is a cute little movie. It's not really a romantic comedy at all: it's more about a mother and daughter who help each other venture down a road of self-discovery and figure out what they really want out of life.",N/A

1020294,"The film starts out so well, and after a while a serious suspension of disbelief was required. Still, I'm a fan of the new assortment of animated features that have been put across our tables, and ""Monster House"" is a treat. I won't go into my issues regarding plot holes, because that would give away too much, and I won't do that. I will say that the assembled cast was without fault; I especially thought Jason Lee captured the essence of the stoner very well. Children have quite resilient imaginations, regarding spooky stuff, and the many plot twists will hold their attention. The bottom line is that this film should be taken for exactly what it is: a fun adventure seen through the eyes of some interesting kids. Indeed, all the characters were well-developed. The widescreen DVD is the ONLY way to see this, and the DVD extras are plentiful and genuinely informative. Enjoy!",N/A
632468,"This movie successfully transitions a great play into a great movie. There are three keys to this success: a beautiful script, an incredibly gifted lead actress, and a director who knows how to sustain the energy of a film from scene to scene, beginning to end. Other reviews have outlined the story, so I won't waste space with another rehash. Besides, the story line is not the essence of the movie. Paltrow gives her best performance of her career, and that is saying something. The story itself catches a whiff of doing mathematics, which is a pretty difficult thing to put on the screen. I especially liked the way Jake Gyllenhaal's character wavered between the obvious fact that Katherine (Gwyneth Paltrow) really had proven the stunning result that the movie revolves around and his obvious ambition to prove his own mettle as a budding mathematician. Mathematicians are at once extremely collegial and extremely ambitious. The script and Gyllenhaal's execution hit just the right tone. Since this is the 58th review of this movie here at Amazon, I won't stretch this out. Know that this fine movie has been carefully transferred to the DVD medium. The film is intense, lean, crackling with energy, fast, endearing -- it made me love mathematics all over again.",N/A

The fourth season of Ranma ? really lives up to his subtitle `Outta Control', so much that it leaves you confused at the end.I enjoy the crazy antics that Ranma dished out so far, but as far as plot goes this new batch of episodes was a bit on the weak side. There are a few great parts in this season. The story where Ranma loses his powers is probably the most heartfelt. It really brings his feelings out especially to Akane. There is also an episode where Ranma comes clean to Shampoo and tells her he really doesn't love her (Don't expect Shampoo to take that so easily). Still, there are episodes that make you wonder why. Shampoo gets engaged to a giant cat; Tatewake Kuno dates Akane's sister Nabiki, crazy Azusa and yes, even Ranma! The other problem with this season is that there are way too many one hit wonder characters. Examples include, The Poker King, Hatta and the new school Coach (who leaves at the end of his debut episodes.Don't skip this season altogether, because there is plenty of wackiness, laughs and fun.

895203,"The Green Butchers (Anders Jensen, 2004)What a wonderful little film this is. If you haven't seen it yet, you should.A dark comedy in the tradition of (but in no way resembling) Delicatessen, The Green Butchers gives us Svend (Mads Mikkelsen) and Bjarne (Nikolaj Lee Kaas), two assistants to Holger (Ole Thestrup), the town butcher. They can't stand him, and Svend is burning to go into business for himself. They find an old butcher shop that'll cost them two million kroner to buy. Svend can get his half by mortgaging his house; Bjarne, on the other hand, has all of his money tied up in a trust related to his comatose brother Eigil (also played by Kaas), whom he hasn't seen in ten years. He asks the sanatorium to turn off the life support devices, gets the money, and the two go into business. Their first day is an unmitigated disaster, with their only customers Svend's girlfriend Tina (Bodil Jorgensen) and the electrician fixing the lights in their meat locker. At the end of the day, Svend locks up and leaves, only to find the next morning that he locked the electrician in the meat locker, and the man froze to death. When Holger comes in to get some meat to feed the town council, Svend panics and sells him the electrician's leg-- and when the town hears about Svend's secret recipe, everyone in town wants meat from Svend and Bjarne's place. Meanwhile, the doctors turn off Eigil's life support, and he wakes up...The film is carried in no small part by Kaas' double-role as Bjarne and Eigil, whose relationship is as deep and complex as any I've seen in modern film. Svend, though the movie's main character, ends up playing straight man to the relationship of the brothers and Bjarne's hard-headed pragmatism, not to mention reluctance to sell the unsuspecting townsfolk human flesh in marinade and pass it off as chicken. And the rest of the movie has a great deal of emotional depth (not to mention excellent comic timing); there's not much at all wrong with the rest of it. (One coincidence does seem forced, which is unfortunate, as much of the movie's plot turns on it.) But it is Bjarne and Eigil who turn this from an amusing way to kill a couple of hours into a real tour-de-force. Highly recommended. ****",The Green Butchers

The movie mirrors the book and the fact leading man Rod Taylor has the role is no surprise as he is perfect for the part. In short the story is of Travis McGee, a Private detective hired to investigate the death of a woman who's sister has been murdered. McGee discoverers the murderer is none other than William Smith who plays Terry Bartell. Smith is awesome in this role and anyone who gazes on that extraordinary physique of his will be impressed his good looks match his formidable strength. Adding to the interest of this film are sympathetic Theodore Bikel as Meyer and Suzy Kendall who doubles as Vangie/Merrimay. Travis and his friends plan an elaborate scheme in which the victim will return to haunt her murderer. What they don't know is that their intended mark is as explosive, unpredictable and dangerous as a lit bundle of dynamite. The final physical confrontation is one of the finest ever recorded on film. So fiercely brutal and bloody that many versions of the movie are highly edited. Rod Taylor at his best and a must film for Taylor fans. ****",Darker Than Amber
1001745,"I have seen several of these movies that are based on video games, but ""Silent Hill"" is the first one where I have been motivated to order one of the games and try it out. This was not just because of the bizarre world that I saw on screen, but also because of the testimonial provided by director Christophe Gans in the special features on this DVD, who started playing the original ""Silent Hill"" game and apparently got three or four hours into it when it hit him it would work as a movie. But there is something to be said for the bizarre world and if style overwhelms substance in this 2006 horror film that is more because the style is so omnipresent than the problematic elements of the substance.So I know nothing about the ""Silent Hill"" videogame and have no idea where the movie is being faithful and where it is grossly offending game players. Rose DaSilva (Radha Mitchell) has an adopted daughter, Sharon (Jodelle Ferland), who sleepwalks across the interstate in the middle of the night to stand on the precipice screaming ""Silent Hill!"" It turns out that this is the name of a ghost town in West Virginia that was abandoned because of uncontrollable fires in the coal minds underneath the town. Rose decides to take Sharon there because that is the sort of thing you do in videogames (or movies) when somebody in a heightened state of awareness starts screaming clues. Besides, Sharon keeps drawing pictures of the place. Rose's husband, Christopher (Sean Bean), does not think this is a good idea so she starts off without telling him and he spends the rest of the film playing catchup.According to everybody Rose asks, you cannot get to Silent Hill from here, except that there is a road sign that still indicates the turn off. However, when Rose takes the fateful road up to Silent Hill she does so by driving away from the female highway patrol cop on a motorcycle who pulled her over. The next thing we know there is a car accident and when Rose comes to again, Sharon is gone. We now have the basic situation of the movie: Sharon is lost in Silent Hill, and Rose is going to have to go find her.Beyond that I really do not want to say more about the plot of the film because what matters is not the specifics of how Rose tracks down Sharon, but that she does it in a world aptly described at one point on the DVD as ""Alice in Wonderland"" meets ""Dante's Inferno."" The latter reference point is obvious because I was thinking early on that Gustave Dore's etchings for ""The Inferno"" were an artistic inspiration for what is going on here (along with Nine Inch Nails music videos) with Carol Spier's production design and Dan Laustsen's cinematography, but I can see where Rose and Sharon have gone down a hell of a rabbit hole as well. Rarely have I seen a film where what is happening is taking a back seat to the locale, but ""Silent Hill"" really is that sort of a film. I want to see what happens next for the visual dimensions rather than for what it means for the narrative.However, I will speak to the apparent confusion that exists over what is going on, without explaining what is happening (and with one hand tied behind my back). At issue is whether Silent Hill is a town gone wrong because of an unnatural disaster, like in ""The Hills Have Eyes"" (think of bituminous coal as the early 19th century equivalent of rampant nuclear energy), or whether it is an alternative reality, like in ""Army of Darkness."" This is a key question, and the answer is that the film is both. That is not obvious, at least not until you catch the key visual difference between the two, but it is important to understanding what is happening in the film. Even at the end I am not totally sure what has just happened, but I saw the final twist coming and I liked it, and I have not liked the final twist in a horror film since ""Honogurai mizu no soko kara."" Now I have to go see about playing that video game.",N/A

679752,"I hemmed and hawed about buying this Yoga Zone DVD for a while, I had the chance to try it out and decided to pick it up.  I wouldn't say it is the best Yoga Zone DVD but a good one for those needing to increase flexibility in the hips and hamstrings, which are my problem areas.  Like most of the other Yoga Zones, there are 2-20 minute segments and both are filmed at the Grand Lidos San Souci resort in Jamaica.  These 2 are filmed on the beach so the scenery is especially nice.Session 1 is led by Jean Kerner, who I have seen in other videos but assisting.  She is joined by Douglas Stewart who does a nice job demonstrating the poses, he is quite flexible too.  You start out in a seated straddle stretch, but add a twist to each side, I personally thought this felt a bit uncomfortable so I might try modifying it next time and do a seated spinal twist instead.  Next is triangle stretch where you will stretch forward over your leg first and then stretch to the side, this is repeated on the other leg before moving to another seated straddle stretch.  This time you will put your hands in front and aim towards moving your chest to the floor, Douglas does this one easily.  Following this you will do cat pose, then move into downward facing dog, low lunge and side lunge on one leg then the other, side stretch while on the knees, then you will do a toe stretch which I have never seen before.  Finishing out this session you will do a seated forward bend and before ending in a cross legged seat.Session 2 is led by Douglas, he is joined by Suzanne.  The focus here is principle of opposition, 2 points moving away from one another.  You will start out in a seated position with legs extended in front of you, then you will lie on your back with your arms extended over your head and legs extended in the air.  You will lower one leg to the floor and raise it back up, then the other leg, repeated once for each side.  Then you will move into table pose with the option of going into reverse plank, this is held for a while and it the toughest pose you will see in either session, kind of felt as if it didn't belong there.  Next you will do a seated side lean stretch, then you will move into cat pose before moving into incline plank then downward facing dog.  Following this you will stand and move into a forward bend, then you will move into warrior 2 on one side, then bound chair pose.  Bound chair is a shallow chair pose but you have your arms extended out in front of you but trying to keep the shoulders back, a lot harder than it looks.  You will repeat warrior 2 on the other side and bound chair once again.Next is a seated straddle stretch, Douglas calls it ""sitting fan"" pose.  Here you will add a side stretch to each side before putting your hands in front and aiming to get your chest to the floor.  Suzanne demonstrates this one nicely.  You will finish out in a seated forward bend before moving into a cross legged seat.Overall I liked these two programs, I thought Jean and Douglas did a decent job for the most part.  I think the cueing could have been a little better in segment 2, but the routines themselves I can see being very beneficial for me and I will use this DVD a lot.  I give this one 4 stars.",Yoga Zone - Stretching for Flexibility

Tia Carrere was wonderful as the college professor who spent more time chasing down lost artifacts than she did in the classroom.While it would have been easy to go too far with a female lead in what would decades ago have surely been a male role, Hawaiin native Carrere always managed to remain feminine while getting the best of others after the same object, or in some cases, Sydney herself. There was a terrific if small supporting cast we came to really like just as much as Sydney.Christien Anholt's character, Nigel Bailey, always brought charm and humor to the role of Sydney Fox's assistant. And Lindy Booth was fabulous as the daffy blonde secretary, Claudia, you loved in spite of her unorthodox mind. Though Booth was missed by fans when she left the show, Tanja Reichert grew into her role as Karen Petrusky, the voluptuous and not so daffy secretary who seemed to have a spark with Nigel.Whether it was caves or jungles or rickety old planes and snakes, it was fun each week to escape for an hour with old and likable friends. It was what television is supposed to be but seldom is anymore. It bordered on camp at times but never crossed the line.While it is true that not everything we fans would like to have been included on this set has been, it is still sweet that it is available at all.

288466,"""Three Godfathers"", John Ford's second version of Peter B. Kyne's oft-filmed story of three outlaws finding redemption, has been hailed by some critics as an unsung Ford masterpiece; while I wouldn't go quite THAT far, it is an exceptional western, with Ford's 'Stock Company', headed by John Wayne, offering warmly sentimental performances.The film was created as a 'tribute' to legendary actor Harry Carey, who had passed away in 1947, and had been young Ford's mentor, starring in his first version of the tale, ""Marked Men"", in 1919. This production would introduce Carey's son, Harry Jr., as likable young horse rustler, William Kearney (""They call me 'The Abilene Kid'""). Wayne took on the elder Carey's role ('Bob Hightower' in this version), the more pragmatic, but caring leader of the trio; and Mexican star/Ford regular Pedro Armend&aacute;riz completed the band, as sweet-natured, if wild-talking Pedro Roca Fuerte. The three are unrepentant outlaws, arriving in Welcome, Arizona to rob the bank, but it is quickly established that they are not 'bad' men...in fact, there are NO real villains in this film. Their antagonist, Sheriff Perley 'Buck' Sweet (Ward Bond), is introduced while gardening outside his home, and he and Hightower have a quite jovial conversation...until the trio discover what his occupation is!The bank robbery goes off without a hitch, but young Kearney is wounded during the getaway, and Sweet and his posse (including Ford regulars Hank Worden and Ben Johnson) are soon in pursuit.To this point in the film, it could be said that this was a fairly standard tale; but the trio's convoluted escape through the Arizona desert leads them to a broken-down wagon at a destroyed waterhole, and a woman (Ford favorite Mildred Natwick), stranded, dying, and about to give birth. Pedro delivers the child, whom she names Robert William Pedro Hightower, entrusting the men, as the child's Godfathers, to take him to safety. She dies, and the three face a responsibility that will change their lives, forever...Released by MGM (although filmed by Ford and Merian Cooper's Argosy Pictures, which explains why the film lacks the usual MGM 'gloss'), the production was ripe with entertaining 'back stories', the most famous involving barrel cacti, and Ford's legendary stubbornness. When Ford told his production team that the outlaws would survive by siphoning water from a barrel cactus, it was quickly pointed that the plants he selected were the wrong species, and wouldn't work. Ford loudly and colorfully disagreed...and, secretly, the night before shooting, liberally soaked all the cacti with so much water that when the cameras began rolling, the next morning, water flowed freely from the chunks cut out of them!There is a prophetic moment in the story; Pedro, his leg badly broken, is left with Hightower's pistol, which he uses to kill himself, rather than face a long, painful demise. Less than fifteen years later, Armend&aacute;riz, dying of cancer, would kill himself with a gun, rather than face the disease's ravages.""Three Godfathers"" is a western story of redemption, set at Christmas, making it an essential for the holidays. While it can't be called 'top-drawer' John Ford, even an 'average' film by the legendary director is better than 99% of Hollywood's product...and not to be missed!",N/A
891240,"I think it was morbid curiosity that made me want to see this.  After all, it had a fairly great cast, interesting choices, some raised an eyebrow (*ahem* Tara Reid and Edward Furlong... could they sober up for this?) and of course, the whole plot of another crow, another storyline based on the crow.  Since I liked the first, the second was bad, the third not-so-bad I had to watch this.  Plus, it was just held back from being released so long, (that's always a dead giveaway) I just knew this was a trainwreck waiting to be watched but wanted to give it a chance.  Oh, I was wrong.  I'm an optimist usually; I like to see the best in things but this was just bad.Whelp, we have another crow story.  This time, out in the desert and playing off the whole Native American aspect.  The film starts kind of artsy and has a ""Pulp Fiction"" feel to it and moves a bit slowly but not bad.  Little bit of corn here and there but tolerable.  The first act:  not bad.The movie was based on one of the Crow graphic novel series that continued after James O'Barr's original.  So basically the plot wasn't pulled out of some Hollywood writer's butt, it was adapted.  Furlong is a down-and-out social outcast who is simply in love with the sweetheart of the town.  Think of Romeo and Juliet.Enter the four horsemen of the apocalypse.  Yeah, it's kind of cheesy that they all have those names, but in the first they were just as cheesy (Fun Boy, anyone?)  Alright, let that slide.  They're out to get revenge on... I think it was the fact a coal mine is being shut down by the reservation to put up a casino.... yeah, the plot is that confusing.  But Luc is going to invoke the power of Satan and become immortal.  To do this, they need specific sacrifices, hence, Furlong and his sweetie will do!The second act is where is starts to become a mess.  Character development is let go completely to introduce a plot that is so messy and confusing that you start to become lost. It borrows too much from the original storyline to really have legs of it's own to stand on and you think: ""Oh yeah, this is going to happen.""  Even that is tolerable until you listen to the wise cracking delivery and start to cringe.Third act falls flat on it's face.  First off, the bloopers are completely visible (which I can't reveal due to spoilers if you actually want to watch it) and the plot stutters around as if it's completely mental.  The end is so cheesy you could spread it on a Ritz cracker.  Boreanez is SO annoying towards the end that it really is painful to watch.  The direction and writing are completely to blame at this part and it's unfortunate because it does seem as if the actors really are trying.Edward Furlong was an interesting choice.  Considering he was an excellent actor in the past and now is more famous for looking puffy-eyed and drugged up in tabloids, I wondered how he'd fare in this role.  He seemed to give it all he had but held back only slightly for whatever reason he chose to.  I get the impression in the first love scene that Emmanuelle Chriqui was disgusted by him because he has his arms around her and she actually seems like she's cringing away from him for some reason.  I think he was just too young to play this role.Tara Reid, dare I say it, wasn't that bad.  She seemed alright in her role of evil mole and her display of emotions was pretty good.  Considering I think she's an idiot, I was surprised she was pretty good.David Boreanez was disappointing.  If you've ever seen Angel, then you know he was playing ""Angelis"" in the role; Wise-cracking to the point of annoying, ridiculous and cheesy, his smart alec comments start alright and then get downright embarrasing.Considering Tara and David didn't even attend the premiere of this flick, I think even they knew it was going to be bad.This is a total trainwreck - not a watchable one either.  It's got that ""Star Wars Holiday Special"" feel to it; You either cringe or start fast-forwarding through it.My recommendation: die hard fans who've tolerated the sequels MAY enjoy a new storyline but will be heavily disappointed by the deliverance of this one.  The original Crow was Goth in it's prime and this one is nothing more than a poorly adapted knock-off.Sunday afternoon viewing only: if you're completely bored, nothing's on... and you're confined to a jail cell somewhere that you can't do anything else.",N/A
998511,"I have been a fan of ""Smallville"" from the beginning, and was very happy both as a viewer and a fan at how this season turned out. In direct opposition to season four's disastrous story arch involving Isobel and the Teague family attempting to manipulate Lana, this one takes a much more serious (and yet enjoyable) path through Clark's choices and their ultimate consequences. It also shifts the love interest from Clark and Lana to Lex and Lana, something they have been hinting at four seasons and only now have the courage to bring out.Lex Luthor and Jonathan Kent do battle to become state senator, Lionel Luthor switches sides (again), Clark consummates his love for Lana and then is forced to give her up, Chloe starts working for the Daily Planet, one of the leading cast members is killed off, and it winds up in the most explosive, dramatic, and powerful season finale of the series.It's rare that I have enjoyed almost every episode in a season, but there is some solid stuff here -- ""Lexmas"" is a heart-ripping ""what if"" featuring Lex's alternate life if he is to choose the path of good, with a sadistic twist in the second half to make Stephen King take a step back; ""Tomb"" is a fantastically fun ghost story in which Allison Mack plays an alternate Chloe; ""Reckoning"" brings two consecutive deaths and a painful funereal; ""Mercy"" revolves around the charisma between Martha and Lionel when a manic madman forces them to make their way through his house of horrors; and five or so episodes revolve around the steadily building seduction of Lana Lang. Tom Welling also makes his directorial debut (and a marvelous one at that) in ""Fragile,"" an ironic twist of fate since it contains a super-hot first kiss between Lana and Lex at the end.I am a little disappointed that there aren't more features (one would have thought at least ""Reckoning"" and ""Fragile"" would get a commentary, and no blooper reel is unfortunate, since many of the actors have mentioned the various pranks and oops! on set) but will be delighted to own this season. I look forward with great anticipation the possibilities the next will bring.",Smallville: Season 5

935158,"Marc Moody has written and directed a film that is so earnest and reaches so high for making a significant statement that it is difficult not to admire the result.  ALMOST NORMAL is so obviously a gay version of 'Back to the Future' by its own admission that it becomes a bit tedious and silly, and when accompanied by low budget and tenuous production values it is a little squeaky in achieving its self-imposed high standards, it comes very close to being a forgettable effort.  So why is it so popular?  It has spirit!Brad (J. Andrew Keitch in a fine film debut) is a 40-year-old closeted gay college professor in Nebraska who lives in fear of derision and is frustrated he is unable to live his life in a happy relationship.  His good friend Julie (Joan Lauckner) is supportive and encourages Brad to return home for his parent's wedding anniversary.  Brad does so reluctantly, finds the usual homophobic atmosphere and in a moment of weakness, drinks too much and has an auto accident.  Miraculously, when he awakens, he has the appearance of a handsome high school kid and when he wanders into the world he discovers that there has been a major reversal: now it is normal to be gay and grossly distasteful to be a straight breeder.  Even his parents are gay with breeder hosts for procreation purposes.  Brad sees reverse discrimination now, is sought after by the high school jock Roland (Tim Hammer), enjoys the freedom of being openly gay, but meets the now new Julie and is strangely attracted to her, having to hide his  new 'straight alliance' in a new closet. And the resolution of this new dilemma is the message of the film.Everything about the idea of the film makes the viewer want to love it, and it is  a sweet little diversion of a film with some thinking material about prejudices.  It is rough and hampered by many technical and casting and scripted errors, but it does give newcomer Marc Moody a strong grounding for making further films about gay life that seem to appear like seeds of ideas throughout this film.  It needs polish but it is a good time and offers a wide audience a better perspective on what it feels like to live a life as an outsider.  Grady Harp, February 06",Almost Normal
434085,"I just recently picked up this DVD (mine was from Gemstone Entertainment). I never heard of it before but I noticed it starred Christopher Lee, Peter Cushing, Telly Savalas and was made in 1972. Although this wasn't a Hammer film, it obviously had the aura of a Hammer film, and I love Hammer films. So I snatched it up (for a buck, no less!).Ah what a pleasant surprise!How can I describe ""Horror Express""? Okay, imagine if a guy had in his hands the DVDs ""The Thing"" (Carpenter's version), ""Murder On The Orient Express,"" ""Trog,"" ""The Good, the Bad and the Ugly"" (huh?) and a few Hammer films with Lee & Cushing. Got that? Okay, now imagine this dude taking a transporter beam back in time to 1972 and re-appearing with only one DVD, a mixture of all the above films. Can you imagine that? Good, because that's pretty much how ""Horror Express"" will strike you.You might be curious as to why I included ""The Good, The Bad and The Ugly"" in the list of films; it's because the score in ""Horror Express"" will bring to mind that popular Western composition, except that it's a bit more eerie and fitting for a 70s horror film.Another highlight of the film is that it features two incredibly gorgeous redheads: Helga Line, who was about 40 years old at the time, and another girl that was about 20 playing a Countess of some sort.At about 88 minutes the film definitely doesn't overstay its welcome, which can be a good thing.In its time I bet ""Horror Express"" was cutting edge horrific entertaiment. Today, some of it will strike you as unbelievable (for instance, Lee accepts too quickly the notion of his caveman/fossil being alive and roaming around the train); at other times it will strike you as amusing (its hard supressing a giggle here and there). But the film at least takes its subject serious; its never campy, that's for sure.If my description perks your interest, don't hesitate to pick up ""Horror Express.""",Horror Express

It's a quick workout that gets your muscles pretty warm, but I didn't really sweat at all (and I only consider myself to be an intermediate exerciser).  Also, some of the exercises require you to lay on or lean on the step in ways that I found outrageously uncomfortable and was forced to move to the floor.  The abs section is TOUGH and the cueing by the instructor is very good throughout.

989918,"I really don't know what to make of this movie. It's kind of like a combination of an ultra-cool eye candy spectacle mixed with the world's worst acid trip. Not that I've ever done acid, but I think this is what it must be like.Comparisons to ""Aeon Flux"" are inevitable, and the two movies do share a lot in common. Both rely on the sex appeal of the female leads. Both are set in a futuristic metropolis-like world where the heroine must battle all sorts of baddies. Both contain strange looking devices, gadgets and other items only found in this type of film. But I found ""Aeon Flux"" to be a little more cohesive in its script; ""Ultraviolet"" goes all over the place with little flow in the plot. And the mind-numbingly bad dialog doesn't help it.But it does have its good points. This has to be one of the coolest-looking movies I've ever seen. Very short on substance, yes, but visually awesome. And what's not to like about Milla Jovovich? Cameron Bright turns in a fairly standard performance as a kid whose only name is Six. Come to think of it, his performance in this movie is pretty much a carbon-copy of his role in ""Birth,"" with that I-know-something-about-you blank stare of his that seems to be becoming his trademark acting style.All in all, ""Ultraviolet"" isn't a bad movie, nor is it a particularly good one either. But its eye candy makes up for what it lacks in a plot and characters one can care about. Worth seeing on the big screen, but at a matinee price.",N/A

He was an excellent teacher and that memory made me curious about this movie.

But when the filmmakers make a Zorro movie that isn't about a charismatic swashbuckler, but instead seems to center on explosions, a weird proto-socialism and divorce (in 19th century California, no less), you know the heart of the film has gotten lost.

There of course were some Hollywood details that were added, but I do not think that they distracted from the bible story because the bible does not talk about them.I do have to agree that the filming and lighting could have been much better, but I think that once you get past that aspect, the movie is pretty well made.

So when we see situations that don't seem possible, please keep this in mind.The original King Kong is one of my favorite movies of all time, but I'm glad this film didn't follow the original note for note. Is it better than the original? Well...In some ways yes and in some ways no. The connection between Ann and Kong,  which a lot of people had problems with,  is welcome, as it makes the story much more interesting and heartfelt. I think Jackson should be commended for his efforts and this could very well be his crown jewel! Both the original and this remake deserve to be in everyone's movie collection!The new extended edition is a worthy purchase as it has a lot of interesting added scenes that should have been in the theatrical release.

501139,"The reason I bought this film, is because I like Talia Shire. The only reason to buy this film is because of Shire, cause if you don't like Shire then I wouldn't recommend you buying this film.The Landlady follows the frustrated Melanie, a woman who's husband cheats on her, a situation that lets something snip in her mind. She becomes obsessed with having the perfect family and husband. After she kills her husband, she moves into an appartmentbuilding which she inherrited. There she meets Patrick who becomes her new object of desire to start a new family with. And she lets nobody, and I mean absolutely nobody come in her way...In technical aspects, the Landlady is ok, not fantastic, but ok. It has good camera movements (some could have been way better to make it more tense) and the lighting is well done which gives some scenes a nice horror feel. The music also is nice in some scenes.Now the acting could have been way better, not counting Talia Shire. Shire is the one who keeps the film away from the pit of the terribly bad films. But although she acts good, in some scenes you really feel that she doesn't give her 100% which is a pitty: she could have done way better than this. But one thing she does perfectly: even though she is the bad one in the film and kills a lot of people, she actually makes you feel for the pshyco landlady. That is what makes her performance ok.Now the rest of the cast acts so emotionalless that you absolutely don't care that they are getting killed. The only one I did care for was a character played by Dee Freeman, she does an ok actingjob also. But as for the rest: they don't feel like people but just minor props that have to be taken care of. You will find yourself looking at the screen saying: ""Oh, there goes another one.""Conclusion: The murders look more funny than they look scary or emotional.Also the tempo of the film is sometimes awfully slow. It takes a long time from one murder to another which will dissapoint slasher and horror fans.So when you sit down and watch the Landlady, watch it with your sense of humor switched on, then it will be more watchable then when you watch it counting on a scary horrorfilm.So if you are a Talia Shire fan, I would recommend you this film cause it is fun to see Shire do something totally different than playing a lovely sweet innocent woman. If you are not a Shire fan, then this film will look like just another low budget, wanna-be horror film to you.",N/A
797586,"My daughter, who had seen this film and loved it, suggested that we watch it together. I agreed and was very glad I did so, as I really enjoyed this bittersweet film. It is a well-acted, well-directed effort about a free-thinking art history professor, Katherine Watson (Julia Roberts), who in the nineteen fifties, lacking Ivy League credentials, manages, through a twist of fate, to get a berth as a professor at traditional and conservative Wellesley College. It is here that she hopes to find herself instructing the leaders of tomorrow.What she finds, instead, is a group of highly intelligent, young women, who are more interested in marrying the leaders of tomorrow than in being leaders themselves. Ms. Watson succeeds in opening the minds of her students to the possibilities and choices life can offer and learns a little about such possibilities and choices herself. She also finds friendship and romance while at Wellesley College. The film also focuses on four of her students, all of whom are given stellar portrayals by the young actresses playing them.Elizabeth ""Betty"" Warren (Kirsten Dunst) is the quintessential fifties girl, obsessed with getting her Mrs. before getting her BA. She later discovers that one should be careful for what one wishes. She is also a nasty piece of work who doesn't care what misery for others her poison pen invectives and barbed comments cause. She eventually gets her comeuppance in a way that she never envisioned. Her best friend, Joan Brandwyn (Julia Styles), is a beautiful, highly intelligent, young woman who harbors a secret wish to become a lawyer. Yet, at the same time, she desperately wants to become a wife and mother. Hers is a decision between choices. She ultimately makes a choice that causes Ms. Watson some consternation but with which she is happy. Giselle Levy (Maggie Gyllenhaal) is a young Jewish miss in a WASP environment who finds herself having short term affairs with her hunky professor and with an older, married man. Connie Baker (Ginnifer Goodwin) is a pleasingly plump, pretty cellist who finds true love, only to find it derailed by the ever evil Betty.Marcia Gay Harden is brilliant in the supporting role of Nancy Abbey, Wellesley College's professor of etiquette and deportment, who, one discovers, has not always followed her own staid advice. Noted British actress, Juliet Stevenson, is outstanding in the small role of Amanda Armstrong, the college nurse and closet lesbian, who is still mourning the loss of her companion of many years. Marian Seldes is perfectly cast as President Jocelyn Carr, whose role at the college seems to be that of keeping the well-heeled alumni and trustees of Wellesley College happy with the status quo. Donna Mitchell turns in a stunning performance as Betty's self-absorbed mother, a woman who is a slave to the expected and puts appearances before her daughter's happiness. Julia Roberts is luminous as the role of Katherine Watson, infusing it with an intelligence and natural warmth that radiates off the screen. Though she has a little bit too contemporary an edge, she still manages to carry the day in the role of the forward thinking professor with the Mona Lisa smile.All in all, this is a wonderful, highly enjoyable film in which the social mores and style of the nineteen fifties are well depicted.",Mona Lisa Smile

667555,"I just finished watching the DVD of this film for the second time...and for anyone who is thinking about renting it (or buying it) I would heartily recommend it.Lush scenery, interesting characters, intense dialogue are all here... The acting was more than satisfying to me, particularly that of Walt Groggins, who plays the stranger who rents the cottage. I am in the process of watching a number of films that contain gay themes this month (Happy Gay Pride to all those out there who know what that means) and this movie fits somewhere toward one of the ends in the breadth of the definition of the genre. The ending, though not how I would have wanted the story to end, was still acceptable. I was left with the feeling that things just might continue between the two male characters eventually...but that for now, the happy ending I was looking for would have to wait (a little like real life, ya think?).My only gripe with the film itself concerns the accents and it's a complaint that I can live with. The southern accents of the different characters here are rathered varied from one another and at times when the characters shout at each other, they seem to dissappear altogether. Another reviewer mentioned that the accents were way over the top when it comes to how people really talk in rural Mississippi, but since I am not a southerner (except for living in NE Florida) I can't agree or disagree with his remark. I can only say that there were times when I couldn't quite understand what was being said. But that problem is easily remedied on a DVD with Subtitles for the Hearing Impaired, a feature I have used time and time again with movies such as this (another film that was greatly helped by SFTHI was Robert Altman's ""Gosford Park"")However, that leads to my other gripe...because you see, there were NO offering of subtitles that would have helped me know what was being said. Actually there were very little in way of extras on the DVD at all (except a trailer that I would STRONGLY suggest the viewer not bother with..unless one desires to be misled completely about the nature or feeling of the film). I must confess to being a ""DVD Extras"" addict and unfortunately, my addiction was sorely unsatisfied by the DVD of this movie.Five stars because it is well worth watching....minus one star for no DVD extras and a minor peeve about inconsistent accents.

271251,"Watching this hilarious sequel to the original hit film is like watching a live action Looney Tunes.  With its fast paced motion, the plethora of gremlins doing wild and crazy things, all the ""in jokes"" and reference to the original, this sequel is just as good if not a little better than its original.Other than the insufferably cute little Mowgie, the other gremlins are horrific little demons who stop at nothing to wreak havoc in a luxurious high rise perpetrated by a Donald Trump tycoon (Mr. Clamp).  The virginal heroes from the original are back and even the snow plow driver and his wife show up.  It's all mindless, reckless fun and very entertaining.  Zach Galligan and Phoebe Cates are appropriately naive and mushy; John Glover is a hoot as the tycoon; Robert Picardo is fine as Glover's henchman, Robert Plosky looking like Grandpa Munster is funny and Dick Miller and Jackie Joseph (who appeared in the original 1961 LITTLE SHOP OF HORRORS) are good as the snowplow driver and his wife.Even almost 20 years later, these guys are hilarious.",N/A
151310,"Take a surgeon with a God complex, a perfect young wife who loves kids, add a sincere doofus of a husband and you will have Malice, an intricate insurance-murder mystery that leaves a satisfyingly full-bodied, nasty taste in your mouth.Andy Safian (Bill Pullman) is a decent, sincere dean at a picture-perfect small college in a picture-perfect New England town. His wife, Tracy (Nicole Kidman), volunteers at a children's center five days a week. They've just bought an old, rundown Victorian house they plan to remodel and fill with kids of their own. In to town comes Dr. Jed Hill (Alec Baldwin), the hospital's new surgeon and a hot shot cutter. Andy and Jed meet the same day and Jed winds up renting Andy's and Tracy's third floor room. Jed needs a place to stay temporarily and Andy and Tracy can use the extra income for remodeling expenses.And then Tracy starts to have abdominal pains. One night she's rushed to the hospital, where Jed operates after getting Andy's permission. Jed removes an ovary he says was cancerous. It turns out Tracy had been pregnant and the ovary was healthy. A medical hearing is held. The result is that Tracy is awarded $20 million, but she is so angry with Andy that she leaves him. Ah, but there's more. To say what would ruin a good mystery. Let's just say that there are a lot of twists and that things very often aren't what they seem. There is some really unpleasant manipulation going on, plus a degree of sexual ruthlessness that would make a fine entry into Krafft-Ebing's Psychopathia Sexualis.The most serious drawback to the movie is a major red herring involving a serial criminal that goes nowhere. The purpose seems only to give Andy a reason to spend the last half of the movie with a seriously bruised face. There also is a semi-red herring involving a doctor in another town that, for the life of me, I couldn't figure out. I think it was most likely a plot point that became a loose string the director figured the audience would forget about.The movie features fine performances by all. Pullman's decent guy persona drives the second half of the movie. Two one-off cameos by George C. Scott as a respected surgeon and Anne Bancroft as...well, you'll need to see the movie...are both important to the plot. Bebe Neuwirth as police detective Dana Harris, a friend of Andy's, nearly steals every scene she's in. She uses an accent that reminds me of Maerose Prizzi, but even so she radiates no-nonsense common sense and a real concern for Andy. Nicole Kidman is what the movie is all about. She gives a performance that is subtle and forceful. Amazingly, 16 years after she made this movie her forehead still has no trace of a wrinkle. Alec Baldwin has spent the latter half of his movie career specializing in unlikable egoists. Here he's interesting and at least a little likable. And does his character, Dr. Jed Hill, really have a God complex? Here's what Dr. Hill has to say for himself: ""I have an M.D. from Harvard. I am board certified in cardio-thoratic medicine and trauma surgery. I have been awarded citations from seven different medical boards in New England, and I am never, ever sick at sea. So I ask you: When someone goes into that chapel and they fall on their knees and they pray to God that their wife doesn't miscarry or that their daughter doesn't bleed to death or that their mother doesn't suffer acute neural trauma from post-operative shock, who do you think they're praying to? Now, go ahead and read your Bible, and you go to your church...and, with any luck, you might win the annual raffle. But if you're looking for God, he was in operating room number two on November 17, and he doesn't like to be second guessed. You ask me if I have a God complex. Let me tell you something: I am God.""On balance, Malice is a nifty piece of complex nastiness. The DVD transfer looks fine to me. There are no extras of any importance. If you pick this up from a discount bin, read the small print carefully. There is a proper anamorphic wide-screen version and a pan-and-scan. The covers look almost identical.",N/A

637448,"Johny Cash is before my time but that doesn't matter. Anyone could watch this movie without knowing anything about him and just fall in love with the movie. Joaquin Phoenix is just awesome here as Johny Cash and even puts his oscar nominated performance in Gladiator to shame. I don't know what kind of expressions the real  Johny Cash made but Phoenix literly becomes someone else here almost as if he's possessed.Cash has a wife and a family and his dream job is to be a singer and after that happens his money is there to support his family but he isn't. Then he meets June Carter (Reese Witherspoon) and that complicates his marriage even more since he falls for June instantly. He gets June to to  sing with him which makes his wife jealous, especially when he starts hanging June's pictures all over the walls. On top of that he becomes a pill popper that washes down the pills with beer. Which gets in the way of his marriage, his dream job and keeping his friendship with his dream girl. All that might sound depressing but you'll feel uplifted and happy by the end.Reese Witherspoon is excellent here and I hear critics say that Philip Seymour Hoffman should win for Capote and that Reese should win best actress. I agree, she should win best actres but how could anyone say she should win and that Joaquin Phoenix shouldn't ? If you listen to the real Johny Cash and the real June Carter sing in the end credits, Phoenix sounds exactly like Johny Cash. While Witherspoon just sorta sounds like June Carter but barely. I'm not knocking her performance, she has a lovely voice and great chemestry with Phoenix period. I just don't see how you could watch this movie and walk away saying that any other actor deserves the award more than Phoenix . I'd love to see them both walk away with oscars.

952846,"Overall I enjoyed this movie.  The performances were very good. A couple of criticisms, though.  The depiction of how Yuri gets into the arms business was weak:  he sees someone get shot at and decides that's his career in life?  Just like that?  Where does he get the money to start? His brother Vitaly.  I disagree with previous commenters that the brother goes into drugs because of what his brother does for a living.  He was boozing it up before Yuri got into the business.  I guess he's supposed to be the conscience for his brother and suffers for it, but his character just strikes me as shallow, before and after.  It's a political film that slams the US as a moral cretin for permitting people like Yuri to sell illegal arms (despite the heroic efforts of one particular Interpol Agent) to ruthless and cold blooded dictators, but if not the US and Yuri, then another country and its Yuri.  Of course, these same dictators are given a pass because, well, people don't kill people, guns kill people.",N/A
1006449,"Warner's Poseidon is less of a movie and more of an experiment in cinema as if Wolfgang Petersen tried to see if a film could be carried only by the authentic emotions of actors in peril. Unencumbered by character development or questions of who to follow, who lives or who dies, or which way to go (one of the most repeated sentiments is ""stay here and we die!"") Poseidon is filmed somewhat incredibly in sequence, with the actors doing their own stunts on gigantic sets.  Petersen and DP John Seale shoot with multiple hand-held cameras striving to capture actual anxiety in the performers documentary style.The result is... OK. Part of the problem is the mix of live action and visual effects. Sure the actors are experiencing on-set peril (wearing safety harnesses), but the film is so chock-full of effects work, from the 99% computer-generated opening shot to the numerous digital set extensions, that we become inured to the spectacle assuming everything was probably shot bluescreen. Nor does the marketing help. In a good DVD extra, Petersen and the actors talk about the harrowing experience of being on set. But their message has already been dulled by the segment's title, ""Ship on a stage,"" which conjures images of actors drinking Evian in trailers between takes.The performances also suffer from perhaps too big a dose of reality. Amazingly, that really is Josh Lucas swimming under a pool of fire. But Lucas' determined expression is the kind of mask we put on when trying to accomplish a task under stress. By putting his actors in difficult situations, Petersen has stripped away actor-y performances to reveal yet another level of performance never getting to primal emotion.Finally, Petersen can't get around the central emotional requirements of mainstream filmmaking. Petersen sets us up to believe that this is going to be a gritty keep moving-or-die drama. Yet, the characters have to pause and reflect when one of their group dies--even though we know that the water is rising quickly around them. These kind of concessions disrupt any attempt by Petersen to capture authentic terror.Poseidon is an intriguing experiment, a sort of big budget reality show in which not-quite bankable actors do their own stunts on gigantic soundstages. This Circus of the Stars-meets-Survivor is a taut, brisk watch forsaking even the expected denouement. But it its desire to strip away the conventions of the genre and distill film to the thinnest of narrative threads, Poseidon also does away with the reason we watch these films in the first place.",N/A

The priest who came to do the exorcism on her told her to stop using the drugs and focus on religion to help cure the evil in her.  This, however, didn't work.

I watched it once, didn't pay much attention to the twist ending, and didn't think about it again.Then I saw it a couple more times and paid attention to the ending. Now I find it leaves me with similar feelings and questions I had after seeing ""The Blair Witch Project"" and ""2001: A Space Odyssey"" to wit: was it real or Memorex?For those of you too young to remember it, the final reference is the tag line from an ad for Memorex tapes. That was back when people actually used audio tape to make copies of audio recordings.Anyway, this movie -- about an English author that goes to a home in France to find her creativity and instead becomes embroiled in sex and murder -- now intrigues me more than the first few times I saw it. I still enjoy the way the plot unravels like a single thread from a ball of twine. I also enjoy the heavy sexual content and the way the camera pans -- you might says ogles -- the young woman that plays the second lead.It's that ending that continues to confound me, however. I still don't know if the content of the film itself actually happenened or whether it was merely the contents of the author's new book...and I didn't learn that until the end. The book the writer hands her boss at the end doesn't seem to verify that.For me, this movie is a mystery within a mystery that seems to get better the more times I see it. I don't often see a new film that intrigues me so, nor do I often leave a film not exactly knowing what I just saw and being unable to completely reconcile its parts, especially one with as much eye candy as ""Swimming Pool"" has to offer.",Swimming Pool

622074,"Kill Bill vol. 2 was a magical movie which transports its viewer to another world of cold blood revenge mixed with lots of heart. The truth is Kill Bill vol. 2 is not as much of an eastern influenced movie as the first. Where vol. 1 was a revenge tale that consisted entirely of fake blood, back flips, and samurai swords, vol. 2 focuses on the heart and souls of the characters. Uma Thurman is back as the bride, and while she is still out on her path of revenge for the killing of her fianc&eacute;, the story takes a detour right in the middle that shows her origins. The Pei Mei sequence is humorous, and sets the stage for future events. At one point, Thurman is berried alive by one of the people that were on her death list. The scene is mildly frightening but in all reality nothing is actually shown. The entire scene shows nothing but the pitch black darkness of her underground tomb. If the audience is not fully engrossed in what they are watching, they might be a tab bit bored during this duration of the movie which lasts about 13 minutes. Like vol. 1, this film is broken in to chapters, starting with chapter 6. Although this movie is director by the infamous Quentin Tarantino, the film is not nearly as violent as was the first. One of the only violent parts is when Elle Driver, (Daryl Hannah), and the bride fight the brutal battle of the blondes. The scene ends with an eye pulled out of its socket. This is not a pretty sight as you can imagine. Hard core fans might not approve of the lack of action and overload of story, but since the story has such a level of coherence, it works. This film is a superb look in to a killers mind and the emotions they go through, and although the sword may have dulled the second time a around, audiences should stick around to see Uma Kill Bill.",N/A

Its back-story is exactly like Van Allsburg's first book turned film Jumanji but the acting isn't as solid. So now you know it's just like Jumanji, so you know that two kids basically start to play a game and somehow someway they're thrown into the game and everything that the game says will happen actually happens. As a person who already saw Jumanji and I'm sure everyone in the world has too seeing as Jumanji's videotape stays in every classroom I've ever been in, I should only have to explain the quality of Zathura. These kids are a little too old for their own good, and they push the PG rating as far they can. Older brother Walter has one dirty mouth so if your child still has virgin ears you may want to watch out for that.Though this story is much like Jumanji Van Allsburg still does a nice job of delivering a different set of characters and ending with a moral that will have siblings hugging each other. The ending is very predictable but if a kid is watching he/she probably won't even notice because the explosive action and fat aliens will catch most of their attention. If you are watching a movie like this with your children you can always stretch a little fib at the end and say ""see this will happen if you keep being mean to your brother"". Zathura is not really trying to come across as a children's classic or an original work but it is a nice family movie though that PG rating is used to the fullest. Walter is funny when he says it but it's not really needed. I would suggest watching Zathura on Starz first since it's being played on there now, it will save you money.",Zathura

He's a beautiful man and does a fine job, especially as Clark Kent.  Unfortunately, he's given little dialogue.  I thought Bosworth and Spacey were both miscast.  His gloomy Luthor is also a man of (too) few words, and he's lethargic and boring to boot.  Bosworth looks like a glamorous 20-year old model and lacks the wonderful awkwardness that made Margot Kidder's Lois so endearing.

823827,"10 years after it first premiered ""Millennium"" is finally beginning to receive the kind of recognition it first deserved. Chris Carter's second creation after the highly successful ""The X-Files"" is a brilliant look at evil and the kind of madness present in our world. The show only lasted 3 seasons and it wasn't cancelled due to low quality, it simply could not compete with it's big brother. ""The X-Files"" is easily the most influential, popular TV drama of the 90's, but ""Millennium"" is now beginning to really flower with the kind of cult status that has saved countless movies and TV shows from being forgotten. Lance Henriksen is a masterful casting choice as Frank Black, a retired FBI profiler who now works with the Millennium Group, a consulting group that helps with serial murder cases but believes the world is edging over so closer to an unclear apocalypse. The concept in 1996 was intriguing, especially since the actual millennium was only a few years away, but now in the post-September 11 world it's downright frightening, since one year into the millennium a horrific terror did in fact come to pass and the world has completely been turned around with wars brewing and cultures clashing. A total apocalypse? Probably not, but not exactly things that should be brushed away. Shining episodes in Seasone One include the acclaimed ""Pilot"" episode which Carter still states best represents what he wanted to do with the series and ""Weeds,"" a powerful story that shows how violence and terror can still find it's way into the most pleasant-looking society. With ""Millennium"" Carter uses fiction to touch upon a frightening reality which is that people have forgotten what evil is or that it even exists. Science and liberalism have made people try and discard the idea that true evil exists, and as much as science has been a blessing, there are still terrible things in the world we simply cannot explain with any secular means. Black has been cursed with the gift of being able to look into the killer's mind and see the terror. The production credits of ""Millennium"" are superb and with it's haunting music by ""X-Files"" maestro Mark Snow, stellar scripts and edgy cinematography, ""Millennium"" is one of those special shows produced with an eye towards the cinematic instead of just regular TV. Had Carter not been tied down by his growing responsibilities to ""The X-Files"" (including the making of the movie in 1998), ""Millennium"" would no doubt have found better footing. Here is one of the great TV dramas, lost but now re-discovered by a growing fan base that will bring to it the kind of respect it deserves.",Millennium - The Complete First Season

Along with The Body Snatchers, I think it stands up as a compelling story with solid dialogue and better acting than we've come to expect from Lewton's films.Boris Karloff, in a performance of skill and complexity, plays Master George Sims, the ruler of St. Mary's of Bethlehem Asylum in London...a forbidding hulk of a stone building. Bedlam, for short. The time is 1761. Bedlam is the place where the insane are sent, as well as inconvenient or embarrassing relatives. The violent ones are kept in chains and in cages. The quieter ones are housed in a huge ward, male and female all together, the floor covered with filthy straw, where the inmates mutter or cry or ceaselessly walk or stare at the walls. But they all cower when Master Sims comes in.Nell Bowen (Anna Lee), is the smart, privileged and arrogant protege of a fat English lord. When she meets Sims her dislike is instant. But Sims counts her patron as one of his sponsors. While many of the upper-class willingly pay a shilling to visit Bedlam and laugh at ""the antics of the loonies,"" Nell finds herself repulsed and outraged. When she sets out to improve conditions, she finds herself blocked by the clever Sims. In a major miscalculation, she aims her furious temper at her protector, Lord Mortimer, leaves him and sets out to make him a laughing stock. Before long, she finds herself an inmate in Bedlam, too. Can she survive in Bedlam by showing kindness? Can she win over the inmates before a confrontation with Sims becomes inevitable? Will she ever be released? Will she find love in the arms of a Quaker she met...and if she does, can she curb her tongue with him? Will Sims ever be brought to justice? All rather mundane questions, but director Mark Robson and the Lewton production team, plus a larger than usual budget, set most of these questions in a fine and repellant reconstruction of an 18th Century insane asylum.As unsettling and threatening as the movie looks, Bedlam is in no way a horror film. Bedlam is a well-balanced character study pitting the obsequious, envious and dangerous George Sims against the resourceful and unintimidated Nell Bowen. Karloff and Lee are more than up to the task. Anna Lee gives us a Nell Bowen who is remarkably quick with her temper and with her tongue. Her description of Sims is pungent. ""If you ask me, my lord, he's a stench in the nostrils, a sewer of ugliness and a gutter brimming with slough."" Boris Karloff gives us a fascinating portrait of a man who fawns over his superiors and abuses his inmates. It's a masterful job. Watch the difference in how he walks into Lord Mortimer's bedroom after being kept waiting for hours and how he strides into his own empire, Bedlam. Watch how he compulsively touches his pig-tailed wig to make sure it's on straight whenever he meets Lord Mortimer. Watch the difference in his stare when Nell Bowen is seen as just Lord Mortimer's plaything and when she's seen as a threat to him. There are several times when Karloff's face registers anger, resentment and satisfaction in just moments and with just a slight movement of his lips. And unlike many of Lewton's films, in Bedlam there are a number of capable actors in smaller parts.With two strong actors, it's good to see that they were given a well-written script to work with. When Sims is accused of abetting the death of an embarrassing ""guest"" at Bedlam, a sane young man who could cause problems for Sims' sponsor, he simply smiles and says that the man's fall from the roof was ""a misadventure, contrived by the victim and executed by nature's law that all who lose their grip on gutters must fall.""Was the treatment of the insane in Bedlam just an historical fact which we have corrected in our modern age? If you are naive enough to believe that you might want to read up on Titticut Follies, a Frederick Wiseman documentary he filmed in 1967. It shows the routine mistreatment and humiliation of the mentally ill by the guards and doctors at the State Hospital for the Criminally Insane at Bridgewater, Mass. Or you might sign up for a sociology class in college that could take you to visit a state hospital for the insane. I can recall my own visit years ago to a ward for men which was filled with patients wearing only untied hospital gowns. The men shuffled about or came up to stare and try to touch or simply rocked back and forth. The ward smelled strongly of human waste.Isle of the Dead:This Val Lewton-produced Poverty Row programer is a good example of why B movies are B movies. The story could be interesting: A small group of people in an isolated setting (in this case, a small Greek island) are forced to deal with a threat to their lives (in this case, a nasty pestilence called septicemic plague), and in the course of the movie some will live and some will die, some will prove brave and some will go mad, some will swear there is an evil force and some will blame things on the wind and the fleas. And yet, while Boris Karloff does a fine job as the aging General Nikolas Pherides, the rest of the cast demonstrate why they never broke out of Poverty Row.It's 1912 and we're in the middle of the Greek wars. The General has won a victory, but there are many dead on the darkened battlefield. He is a hard man, driven by duty and patriotism, yet by his standards fair. He's not without warmth and friendliness. He and Oliver Davis (Marc Cramer), an American reporter, visit a small island, used for decades as a place of burial, where his dead wife lies in a crypt. The island is just off the coast where the General's army is encamped. They find the crypt has been forced open and the body missing. But on this isolated little crag of an island they find a large stone house where there is a Swiss archeologist; his severe Greek housekeeper from whom he bought the house; Thea (Ellen Drew), a beautiful young servant; and three guests...soon to be just two. One of the guests, in the middle of dinner, declares he feels ill and staggers to his room. He is soon dead of the plague. The General has an army doctor come over who confirms their worst fears. The General is determined to fight the plague and keep it from infecting his army. He takes charge of the house. He insists that no one may leave the island. They all can only wait and hope the plague strikes no more of them down. And all this time the housekeeper whispers about death and demons. She sees the work of the dreaded vorvolaka, a wolf spirit in human form, and she insists the vorvolaka has taken the shape of the servant girl. As people die, we have noble death, madness, a live burial and, in at least one case, the triumph of superstition.What to make of this? The first half of the movie is a taut look at people reacting under pressure, led by the excellent performance of Boris Karloff. We start out on a Greek battlefield at night, filled with the groaning wounded and the dead in carts being hauled to speedy mass burials. ""The rider on the pale horse is pestilence,"" explains General Pherides to the reporter, ""and he follows the wars."" Then we're off on a small boat to the dark, well-imagined mountainous island, full of rocky, steep paths, threatening trees, a mouldering crypt and crashing waves below a cliff. We meet the cast and, at dinner, see their tentativeness. We can take a measure of their characters. But then the second half of the movie is upon us. We're in the middle of a corny Hollywood horror story with awkward acting (except for Karloff) and even cornier dialogue. ""The vorvolaka still lives,"" whispers the crone of a housekeeper, ""rose-cheeked and full of blood!"" We're in the poverty-row world of white gauzy gowns slipping around corners, of creaking caskets, a mad death scene, a vicious-looking trident and a leap off a cliff. It's become predictable.The movie has great atmosphere and Karloff. It's enough for a strong beginning but, in my view, not enough for a strong ending. I particularly enjoyed two members of the cast, in addition to Karloff. One, Skelton Knaggs, is only on screen for a couple of minutes. Knaggs had a distinctive-looking face, weak, ugly and unhealthy. Combined with his whiny voice, he was hard to ignore. In another Val Lewton-produced movie, The Ghost Ship, he plays a deaf-mute who, it's true, narrates the story. The other actor I like is a woman named Katherine Emery. She plays the ill wife of a British diplomat. She has a cultured, precise and unhurried voice. Close your eyes and you'd swear you were listening to Mercedes McCambridge. To see her in full dominant mode, watch Eyes in the Night.------Bedlam looks just fine on the DVD disc it shares with Isle of the Dead, There is one extra, a commentary by Tom Weaver, identified as a film historian.

There are some truly hilarious moments in this film.  Granted, it's light entertainment, but who cares.  I'm not a fan of The Office or the Daily Show, so my only previous experience with Steve Carell was his funny performance in Bruce Almighty.  In this film, Carell shows some real acting chops.  He veers wildly from great comedy to touching dramatic moments.  Given the right material I think Carell could be the next Jim Carey, but without all the screen hogging.",N/A
977033,"THE MATADOR is one of those surprising films whose title seems to suggest something entirely different from the story it tells - until the viewer has the pleasure of viewing this fast paced, immensely entertaining comedy and 'Matador' takes on a whole new meaning!Richard Shepard wrote and directed this story of a hitman (Pierce Brosnan in one of his finest roles) on the skids who happens to meet a sweet nice guy (Greg Kinnear) whose business is so on the skids that he has traveled to Mexico City for a chance for survival, temporarily leaving behind his wife (Hope Davis) in the midst of a rainy accident to their home.  The two disparate men meet in a bar, share drinks, and after some of the cleverest tete a tete on film form a bond that neither of them expects.  Brosnan's hitman character and Kinnear's slipping business failure at first collide and then mutually benefit from embracing what seem to be polar opposites of characters.  How the whole chance meeting alters their lives is hilarious, edgy, and tender.Brosnan, Kinnear, and Davis display fine ensemble acting and keep the movie constantly flowing despite the strange twists and turns the story takes.  But a great deal of the credit goes to the razor sharp direction of Richard Shepard whose sense of comic and dramatic timing are superb.  This is a very well done, highly entertaining film that offers the cast plum roles and the audience a terrific evening of entertainment.  Grady Harp, July 06",N/A

I don't think I can say anything about it that hasn't already been said in the reviews for this movie, other than I'm not really into movies from the 1930's and 40's, but I like to watch a classic now and again, and I enjoyed this movie a lot.In particular, I was fascinated to see Walter Pigeon playing the role of a preacher with a romantic interest.  I've always thought of him as the mad scientist in Forbidden Planet, and the mad captain of the Seaview in the original Voyage to the Bottom of the Sea.

921982,"Forget ""Kundun"" or ""Seven Years in Tibet.""  Good films, but those are Hollywood.  For an emotionally authentic depiction of the oppression of the Tibetans, I don't think I can recommend a better movie.  First of all, the Tibetans in the film are not professionals but actual people who experienced the injustices.  There is a scene in a Buddhist monastery where the nuns are told by Chinese soldiers they can no longer display a picture of their beloved Dalai Lama. The nuns cry real tears and you can tell the difference!  Second, many clips were shot clandestinely under the nose of Chinese spy cameras. We see the real Tibet.  The story is extraordinary too.  It begins with the shocking execution of a grandfather who distributed a poster: Chinese should leave Tibet.  This event tramautizes the family, in particular the grandchildren and their cousin. The cousin reacts by becoming a nun in a Lhasa monestary. The brother becomes an embittered, aimless drifter.  The sister reacts by accommodating to the Chinese and becoming a pop singer.  When the nun continues her protest 18 years later and is literally beaten to the edge of death by Chinese torturers, the whole family has to revisit the meaning of family and the meaning of Tibet to them. That is the outline of the plot. This is a deeply moving and deeply disturbing film about ordinary people who react in an authentic way to a family and national tragedy.  It has a documentary feel that is unmatched save for the much older ""Battle of Algiers."" Truly a great film!  The DVD extras explain the political - almost espionage nature of the creation of the movie.",N/A
298743,"Like others I have watched the Godfather movies religiously and watched the third installment somewhat with a low expectations because of the negative reviews. Of course coming back to a loved story after so many years is not an easy thing. The movie isn't bad by any means. Just the religious and cult like following the first two Godfather has, it's hard to live up to.Three things that I thought took away from the quality of the film:1. Sofia Coppola: she was not good in this movie at all. At times she looked bored, most of the time she looked confused. I believe Francis Ford Coppola, being her father didn't push her enough to the performance the movie deserved from such an important character. Winona Ryder was said to been a contender for this role.2. Robert Duvall: One of the Best actors from the original cast was left out from this film because of money. He is quoted recently as saying, ""I said I would work easily if they paid Pacino twice what they paid me, that's fine. But not three or four times, which is what they did,"" recalls Ducal. His absence and the addition of Sofia was a smack in the face of diehard fans.3. Andy Garcia: Don't get me wrong, he's a good actor but he acted like all he did was research on mob guys, I didn't get the impression that he was ever a tough guy in real life. Someone like Johnny Depp would have killed in this role.There are alot of really good reviews on the movies so I won't write anything long but these three things took away from the quality of the movie for me. I couldn't believe these characters as much as the originals. An excellent gangster movie on it's own, but within the Godfather trilogy definitely the weakest.","The Godfather, Part III Final Director's Cut  VHS"

The Busby Berkley set has each film/DVD in its own case.  This set has a fold out with the discs stacked on top of each other in groups of two.  Of all the films selected, Four Frightened People seems an odd choice if one is trying to do a retrospect of this man's achievements.  Perhaps, like stories by Edgar Allan Poe, this film was tension filled during its time, but it seems rather bland by today's standards.  It is a film that could have been directed by anyone.  I found myself more concerned with the fate of the King Charles spaniel than the rest of the cast.  They should have selected a more worthy film for this collection, like Samson and Delilah, as DeMille was known for the pagentry and casts of thousands in his films. Sign of the Cross is presented in its original entirety, with Intermission and several scenes cut out by the censors now fully restored.  Cleopatra is typical thirties fare, coming off more like Dinner at Eight than a study of the exotic Queen of the Nile.  Perhaps someday someone can tell me....why Claudette Colbert as Cleopatra?

1009258,"Two things caused me to give this film a rental: the comparisons to ""Suspiria"" and Bruce Campbell. Combining these two elements, this movie should have been a no-brainer. Most modern horror movies lack the sense of tension of the movies of the 80's and before. For example, ""Halloween"" is pretty tame in the gore department but the atmosphere, camera work and music combine to give the viewer the feeling of ""What's going to happen next?"" throughout. I can't think of one modern horror movie; aside from ""High Tension"", that creates that same sense of dread.Well, you can toss ""The Woods"" into the ""Nice Try"" pile with the likes of other modern pseudo-horror like ""Hostel"". The premise is moderately similar to ""Suspiria"" in that both movies include witches and a school surrounded by woods but there is where the similarities end abruptly. The set pieces themselves are moderately good to a point but the way this film is lit, it is hardly intimidating at all. It reminds me of Hogwarts. Sadly, the girls in this school are able to scare the viewer in the same way Harry Potter might, which is to say that if you are 6 years old and Harry Potter movies cause you to leap from your seat, ""The Woods"" might be up your alley if you are seeking a good scare.With that said, the plot or story really unimportant. Basically, the school is run by witches and the woods surrounding the school are haunted by three witches from the 1800's. This might be somewhat effective if the witches in the school were a little creepier than the ones we are given but again, the intimidation factor is on par here with that of some cheesy Halloween made-for-TV movie on ABC Family Channel. The death knell for me (aside from the snail's pace  at which this movie plods along) was the main antagonist -- the woods themselves. The trees come to life and claim victims inside the school, specifically the one that sleeps in the bed at the end near the window. Game over.Nope, not even Bruce Campbell could save this movie from being an overhyped letdown. In addition, Lucky McKee's entry in the Masters Of Horror series ""Sick Girl"" was also only moderately interesting in premise only. The actual episode was hampered by poor acting by the lead actress and a complete lack of horror sensibility. So, if you truly must see ""The Woods"", give it a rental first and then decide if a purchase is absolutely necessary. For my money, I'll just watch ""Suspiria"" instead, as it blows this movie out of the water.",N/A

991752,"The opening of the Prison Break television show is something right out of a Sam Fuller movie. A non-descript man gets an extensive tattoo on his body and then proceeds to rob a bank with the sole purpose of getting arrested. He pleads no contest and is sent to Fox River State Penitentiary for five years. Why? It turns out to be part of an elaborate plan devised by Michael Scofield (Miller) so that he can hook up with his brother Lincoln (Purcell) who is in the same prison, sentenced to die for a crime he did not commit: killing the Vice-President's brother.There is a lot more going on in Prison Break than just its intriguing premise. The show cuts between Michael and Lincoln's exploits in prison and the elaborate conspiracy that exists in the outside world that may have resulted in Lincoln's unjust incarceration. There is a sparseness, an economy to the prison dialogue that is refreshing and gives it a B-movie feel with its loads of tough guy speak. The series has the same kind of edgy, pulpy feel but with a polished sheen reminiscent of 24 and Lost and it should be interesting to see if it can maintain the same level of quality and tension in the second season.There are ten audio commentaries for several episodes.The first disc features an audio commentary on the ""Pilot"" episode by creator Paul Scheuring and actor Dominic Purcell. . Scheuring talks about the challenge of casting the roles of Michael and Lincoln but tends to start most comments with ""This is the guy..."" or ""In this scene..."" which gets tiresome pretty fast.The second commentary for this episode is by its director Brett Ratner and editor Mark Helfrich. Ratner agreed to shoot the episode only if he could use his crew that works on his movies. The director is surprisingly engaging and informative: everything that the first one with Scheuring should have been.There is a commentary on ""Cute Poison"" by Scheuring and cast members Purcell and Wade Williams. Scheuring continues his self-congratulatory comments while Purcell cracks jokes and Williams is barely there.The second commentary on this track is by its writer Matt Olmstead and actor Silas Weir Mitchell. They provide plenty of interesting and amusing anecdotes filming this episode.The second disc features a commentary on ""Riots, Drills and The Devil (Part I)"" by Scheuring and cast members Purcell, Amaury Nolasco, Williams, Robert Knepper and Sarah Wayne Callies. Scheuring talks about some of the censorship he faced. For example, the studio made him change a tattoo of Jesus on Michael's arm to the Devil so they wouldn't offend religious folks.The second commentary for this episode is with its director Robert Mandell and writer Nick Santora who talks about the various script changes and addresses the tattoo controversy. Both are well-spoken and provide good observations on this episode.Also included is a commentary for ""Riots, Drills and The Devil (Part II)"" by Scheuring and cast members Purcell, Nolasco, Williams and Peter Stormare who talks about growing his hair for the role and not playing his character like a traditional Italian mob boss. One wishes that he spoke up more as his comments, including a story about John Heard, are very entertaining.The third disc includes a commentary on ""Odd Man Out"" by producer Garry Brown, director Bobby Roth and writer Karyn Usher. They talk about the challenges of incorporating the tattoos into the story and using them as a device to provide clues to Michael's plan.The fourth disc has a commentary on ""Brother's Keeper"" by Scheuring and cast members Purcell, Nolasco, Williams, Knepper and Callies. This was a flashback episode to show the dramatic arc of the relationship between Michael and his brother. The actors talk about the cold weather they had to endure while shooting this episode.There is a second commentary by director Greg Yaitanes and writer Zack Estrin. This was a nice change of pace for the actors because it got them out of the prison. Estrin talks about some of the script changes and they both end up discussing character development in some detail.The sixth disc contains the rest of the extras, including ""Making of Prison Break"" with Scheuring and Ratner talking about the origins of the show. The director was impressed by how well plotted it was and with Scheuring's vision. However, a lot of their comments are repeated in the various commentary tracks while key cast members talk about the arcs of their characters in this so-so extra.""If These Walls Could Speak: Profile of the Joliet Correctional Center"" profiles the prison they shoot the show in. A lot of infamous criminals were incarcerated there - including Al Capone and John Wayne Gacy.

Tattoo artist Tom Berg talks about designing the tattoos and shows off some of his preliminary sketches.""Fox Movie Channel Presents: Making a Scene - Prison Break"" takes a look at a scene between Michael and his new cellmate Haywire (Silas Weir Mitchell) in his cell and the challenge of shooting in such small, confined spaces.

990969,"Iphigenie en Tauride is a great opera by a great composer, so it is nice to finally have a production available on DVD. Is this an ideal production? Probably not. I had never seen the work produced onstage before watching this, but based on my limited exposure to the opera, this DVD works beter on audio terms than on visual ones.Gluck's operas come between Handel's and Mozart's, they form a bridge between baroque and classical. In the development of opera as an art form Gluck was a very important figure. He took opera seria and made it more direct, more visceral, more dramatic, trimming many of the frills associated with the genre so that the result is something compact, intensified, emotionally engaging(similar to what Verdi accomplished with bel canto). Iphigenie en Tauride might just be the epitome of this approach. Typical of opera seria, there isn't much action...most of the key events have already happened offstage, before the opera begins, leaving the characters to dwell on their personal crises and emotional conflicts that result from said events. Despite all this, Iphigenie is a swiftly paced opera, it doesn't crawl, it MOVES, and this is a result of Gluck's galvanized score, driving the characters and story toward the denouement in a minimal amount of time(the running time on this disc is under two hours) but with a high level of energy. Brilliant writing on the composer's part. No doubt Gluck played an influential role in the young Mozart's development in producing music that was equally mobile and consuming.The audio portion of this disc is virtually flawless. All the singers are in fine voice. Juliette Galstian and Rodney Gilfry, the two leads, sing in a manner that is powerful, intensely dramatic, larger than life. They really pour themselves into the turmoil of their characters, as a result they dominate both the music and the viewer's attention. Zurich Opera's Orchestra La Scintilla, under the direction of William Christie, a specialist in this kind of music, gives a scintillating performance(appropriately enough for an orchestra bearing that name) that is not for the faint of heart, constantly pushing the drama forward. My only complaint with the sound is that there is some distortion at some points, usually when Galstian pushes the high notes with maximum force.The visual portion doesn't fare nearly as well. By that, I don't mean to undermine the attractiveness of the singers, not by any means. Galstian is gorgeous, and the dashing Gilfry could easily pass for Brad Pitt's identical twin; it isn't hard to see why he is so popular in studly roles such as Don Giovanni and Billy Budd. No, my complaints rest with the production. I don't oppose modern productions as a rule, particularly when they are attached to more familiar works, but I have a problem when they serve no purpose other than to confuse the narrative and muddle the themes. The story takes place in ancient Greece, in fact it covers some of the same characters and events as Strauss' Elektra. Placing Iphigenie, Orestes and the rest in more contemporary dress, and having them flit about in surreal-looking drawing rooms fogs the viewer's understanding of what is actually going on. As for the giant-headed characters constantly shuffling around in the background, reenacting key events(usually of a violent nature) like some kind of mute Greek chorus...they are interesting to watch at first, even somewhat effective, but increased exposure reduces their impact to one of silliness. Overall, many of the backdrops are visually striking, they simply add nothing to the drama, if anything they make it more opaque.Because of the wonderful music, and because this is the only version of the opera available on DVD, I give it a high recommendation. Regarding the production, however, seeing as how this was my first visual exposure to Iphigenie, I would have preferred a more traditional approach.",N/A

But though the ""death of 2-D animation"" debate will undoubtedly strike a chord in many viewers, I found the film might have played better had it been more objective. Anyone who's lost a job they needed badly might have a hard time identifying with the underlying sense of entitlement that occasionally pops up. The emotion and the heartbreak are real, but one gets the sense that the Disney employees were insulated in sometimes harmful ways from the realities of the industry, the truth about the corporate mentality, and the significance of their own careers. I'd think this would best be seen as a cautionary tale for anyone who believes their job is guaranteed secure until retirement.

988785,"Duplicitous values and ethics pepper this fine little courtroom comedy drama, a Sidney Lumet special that has a carefully chosen cast of fine actors and a story based on fact (much of the script being lifted from actual courtroom transcriptions) that is both informative and entertaining and offers Vin Diesel the opportunity to test his chops at serious acting.Other than the opening scene when Giacomo ""Jackie Dee"" DiNorscio (Vin Diesel) is shot several times in his bedroom, the entire film takes place in jail cells and the courtroom that housed the longest criminal trial in American history.  Jackie's fanatic devotion to the pledge never to rat on family or friends is put to the test in a case against several Mafioso characters.  The trial is presided over by Judge Finestein (a superb Ron Silver) with prosecuting attorney Sean Kierney (Linus Roache in a strong departure from his usual screen characters) and among the defense attorneys is the lead attorney Ben Klandis (Peter Dinklage, once again proving he is a powerhouse of an actor).  Jackie acts as his own attorney and this is the joy of the film: watching a good fella with a sixth grade education rely on his intuition and charisma with the jury to bring down a verdict thought impossible is not only a delight to see as a role for Diesel, but gains a respect for a character who at the outset seems far from deserving of same.  The supporting roles include the consisitently fine Annabella Sciora as Jackie's ex-wife, Alex Rocco as the acerbic despicable Nick Calabrese, Raul Esparza as the perpetrator of the gunshots and the smarmy FBI rat witness against Jackie, and so many more.In a film of this caliber it is odd that the sound editor did not have the courtesy to filter out the ambient courtroom noise that at times buries much of the softer, and very poignant dialogue.  While we are in the courtroom (which is the major part of the film) the noise from the air conditioning, or camera gear or whatever just rumbles along intrusively.  But even that technical faux pas doesn't diminish the work of Sidney Lumet nor dim the fine performance by Vin Diesel, complete with prosthetic additions to his body to make him appear more like the real life 'Fat Jack' than the hunks Diesel usually plays!

After Bacon was invisible he began rampaging around killing off people one by one, terroizing Josh Brolin and Elisabeth Shue and eventually getting blown up in an elevator shaft. Now 6 years later they make another one...Hollow Man 2 and now in the spot as the invisible Assassian Hollow Man is none other then Christian Slater (Heathers, Pump Up The Volume) who is only in a couple of scenes but provides voices overs. Peter Facinelli (Can't Hardly Wait, Tempted) plays Det. Turner who after his partner is killed in an atempt to capture Hollow Slater runs around with Doc Laura Regan (Wes Craven Presents THEY) who so happened to be a part of the experiment involvoing Slater going invisible. How Hollow does this movie go? Well it has its moments and Peter Facinelli is basically the only one who keeps it alive. Slater looks cool in blue makeup but man...come on, going from crappy movies like The Deal, Manhunters to this?! I so hope he gets better movies. Regan's acting is bland and I'm not liking the short hair on her. The curly long hair in the scene where Slater goes Hollow was nice but short....no. So, all in all it wasnt that fantastic and I hope they dont make a Hollow Man 3. Well, if they do the only actor I have in mind for the role is Corey Feldman....just kidding....or am I?",N/A
214223,"The beginning of this VHS treats you to a preview of the upcoming new tv series, STAR TREK: THE NEXT GENERATION (1987-94).This film also is dedicated to the crew of the space shuttle Challenger who exploded 73 seconds after take-off on January 28, 1986.Leonard Nimoy is the director of this film.The Ambassador of Klingons (John Shuck) is upset with James T. Kirk and the Genesis project.  Sarek (Mark Lenard) attends the trial to defend Admiral Kirk.Currently, their is a probe from an unknown source in space that is causing phenomenal weather conditions in Juno, Alaska and San Francisco, California where Starfleet is based.  The probe is vaporizing the ocean.Stardate: 8390: Spock has had three months of Vulcan exile.  Spock (Leonard Nimoy) is taking a computer exam.  When asked, ""How do you feel?"", Spock does not know how to answer.  Spock's mother, Amanda (Jane Wyatt) explains to her son, his human feelings for the crew of the Enterprise.  Spock returns to command, however McCoy (DeForest Kelley) has some misgivings about Spock that he might not have all of his bearings yet.  The Enterprise crew has decided to return to Earth in the Klingon spaceship since Starfleet cannot send a ship. The Enterprise ship, their home, had to be abandoned and was destroyed. By a timed destruction, they saved their lives.  They must find a way to tranmit to the probe to stop its avenge.  The tranmission signals the probe which is releasing a whale song. It needs a reply.The Enterprise crew, along with Scotty (James Doohan), Chekov (Walter Koenig), Sulu (George Takei) and Uhura (Nichelle Nichols), must travel back to the 21rst Century to find humpback whales and bring them into the 23rd Century to reply with the probe.  At warp speed 9.8, they end up at 20th Century Earth.  They follow a whale signal and they land in San Francisco, California in the Golden Gate Park.  It is 1986.  Kirk and Spock find a whale biologist, Gillian (Catherine Hicks) that will be of some help to them.Also in the cast: Robin Curtis, Majel Barrett, Grace Lee Whitney, Vijay Amritraj, Madge Sinclair, Michael Berryman, Joe Lando, Brock Peters, Robert Ellenstein.This is my least favorite Star Trek film, however, I did enjoy the comic relief of our beloved Enterprise cast abd Catherine Hicks was a ""seventh heaven"" to look at.  Always nice to see Jane Wyatt.Jane Wyatt played Spock's mother, Amanda, in the original STAR TREk tv series, Season 2, episode #10, ""Journey To Babel"" with Mark Lenard as ""Sarek"" in 1967.The next year after this film, a new tv series, STAR TREK: THE NEXT GENERATION, premiered on the UPN Network in 1987, introducing a new crew to the Enterprise, set 60 years after Kirk's original reign as Captain.  DeForest Kelley returned  as Dr. McCoy as the oldest living crew member, in the pilot episodes.  Majel Barrett, Mark Lenard and Leonard Nimoy would later appear in the tv series.The next film is:Star Trek V - The Final Frontier(1989).Followed by:Star Trek VI - The Undiscovered Country(1991).Star Trek - Generations (Two-Disc Special Collector's Edition)(1994).The cast of Star Trek: The Next Generation (1987-94) took over the movie franchise.Star Trek - First Contact(1996).Star Trek - Insurrection(1998).Star Trek - Nemesis (Full Screen Edition)(2002).The original STAR TREK characters (1966-69, 1979-94) in their younger Starfleet Academy years was explored again in STAR TREK (2009) and Star Trek Into Darkness (2013).Update: The 50th Anniversary of Star Trek is September 8, 2016.

643563,"AMERICAN DREAMZ is a pitiful mess of a movie, a film that seems as though it wants to be a satire on the Bush administration, on talk show hosts, and on our current state of mindless entertainment that seems to keep high ratings and low IQs neck and neck.The story, what little there is, involves a bored talent show host (Hugh Grant, who looks very down in the tooth) desperate to get out of his mindless role, and hungry for people who are over the edge to come on his popular show and make fools of themselves. He manages to accomplish this from some rather innocent folks as well as the President of the United States (GWB imitator Dennis Quaid, Laura Bush imitator Marcia Gay Harden, and Cheney imitator Willem Dafoe).  Along the way we meet some fragments of characters portrayed by some fine actors who bought into this venture belonging to Paul Weitz for some unknown reason: Mandy Moore, Jennifer Coolidge, a promising Sam Golzari, Chris Klein, Seth Meyers, and  Shohreh Aghdashloo.Satire can be one of the finest forms of art, but it requires a very intelligent script.

1035297,"Why five stars?  Because I WANT people to see this film.  I WANT people to realize what is going on in this country, under their very noses.  To see that our most innocent and vulnerable segments of our population are being manipulated and used for the purposes of a select group of people who believe they alone possess the ""truth"".How the filmakers could just quietly stand by and film this documentary without becoming upset by it is beyond my understanding.This is the scariest film I have ever seen.  Children who should be out playing and having fun are being brainwashed into becoming ""warriors for Christ"".  It is wrong on so many levels.  Taking every child's dream of being a super hero and twisting it into religious fanaticism-have we learned nothing from the past?The movie shows youngsters writhing on the floor, crying over perceived ""guilt"", speaking in tongues and ready to give up their lives and be martyrs (now where have we heard THAT recently).  Carrying around plastic images of fetuses is not the way to introduce children to the birds and the bees. Red-the color of blood-permeates this scene as children parade around with their little dolls and wallow in perceived goriness. It presents a warped image at the very least.  IF it is the goal of a religion to teach that abortion is wrong (and last time I looked, it is still legal in the US), there are kinder, gentler ways to do so.This film barely stops short of showing adults allegedly training children to overthrow the government as they smash pottery that represents Congress.  Incendiary, brainwashing (Goebbels would be proud) and harmful to fresh, young minds.I have heard that the woman preacher has closed down ""Jesus Camp"" because of fear of further vandalism.  I think her actual motives are somewhat along different, more personal and legal lines.I can foresee years of therapy ahead for some of these youngsters who have had a heavy guilt trip laid upon their innocent shoulders, as their faces redden and tears stream down their cheeks because they have been told they haven't been ""good enough"".  Where has the joy of childhood gone?But the biggest question of all remains:  what sort of parents would allow others to do this to their children?  Therein lies the most frightening aspect of this film.",Jesus Camp
957043,"The DVD extras on ""Howl's Moving Castle"" pretty much repeat the format used for ""Spirited Away."" Rather than focus on Hayao Miyazaki and his typically fantastic film, the featurettes fuss over Pixar's stewardship of the movie.To be fair, let's note that Pixar and Disney have more than lived up to their vow to give the Japanese animator first-class treatment in the States. For example, they spent big on the dubbing talent for ""Howl,"" which includes Christian Bale, Lauren Bacall, Billy Crystal, Blythe Danner and Jean Simmons. Pixar's creative frontman John Lasseter declares this ""the best English-language dub of any picture I have seen."" Viewers who usually go straight for the subtitles may even agree, depending on their tolerance for Disney-style sidekicks. ""You never see a fire demon before?"" Crystal asks, as if he's serving up some Carnegie deli. (Remote, please.)An interview with the English dialogue director, Pete Docter, and a docu on Miyazaki's visit to Pixar both were shot for the use of Japanese broadcasters and repurposed on the DVD without explanation, making for odd cross-cultural viewing in spots. (Miyazaki enthusiasts thrive on this kind of disorientation, of course.) The Japanese director addressed the Pixar troops before a ""Howl"" screening. The film is ""true to my heart,"" he warns the audience of film pros. ""And that might confuse you."" Miyazaki has said this tale of a moody wizard and the teen who loves him -- even after she's turned into a 90-year-old crone -- could be his last project. Fans of the director know more or less what to expect except for the Victorian setting. Newcomers should start at the top, with ""Spirited Away,"" then circle back.The other major extra, which takes up disc 2, is a feature-length storyboard presentation. Few of the drawings have much visual impact and there's no option to view the finished scenes at the same time, as there was on Asian ""Howl"" DVDs.The widescreen images (1.85:1) look fine, perhaps a bit too artificially sharp. The 5.1 surround is strong and nicely detailed, with all speakers in play. When Howl's castle moves, the subwoofer pounds the ground right along with it.",N/A

Its a very bright and vibrant film punctuated with brief periods of extreme darkness. To me this is Lynch's most 'happy' work.Having said that in the film there is rape, murder, dismemberment, and plenty of tragedy. But in many of his other films, you get the feeling that theres horror just off the screen, this pulsing horror waiting to devour you. In this film you feel the opposite, you feel a certain light around the main characters protecting them.

736450,"One of George Eliot's most brilliant novels was ""Daniel Deronda,"" a heartfelt story about a young man searching for his past, and in it, his future. The BBC did a brilliant job dramatising this, with an excellent cast and an exquisitely beautiful backdrop -- and all the feeling, message and passion of the original book.Daniel Deronda (Hugh Dancy) is the ward (and rumored illegitimate son) of a nobleman, but he feels somehow aimless and unfulfilled -- he wants to devote himself to something, but doesn't know what. During a tour of Germany, he encounters pretty, reckless, arrogant Gwendolyn (Romola Garai) at a casino.Gwendolyn (who boasts that she gets everything she wants) is interested in Daniel, but when her family loses all their money, she marries a rich suitor, a relative of Daniel's -- knowing that his mistress and illegitimate children will be disinherited. But she soon finds that her new husband is a sadistic brute, and sees Daniel as her only help.Meanwhile, Daniel rescues the despairing Mirah Lapidoth (Jodhi May) from a suicide attempt, and he helps the young Jewish singer find a home and friends. As he helps her find her family, he becomes passionately attached to the Jewish population and their plight. Then he receives an important message -- one that will illuminate his roots, and give him a course of the future.When Eliot published her final novel, it caused a massive stir -- not many novelists tackled the plight of the Jewish population, or how it compared to the gilded upper classes. In a way, ""Daniel Deronda"" is both a love triangle and an allegory -- Daniel must choose between the pretty, shallow English life (Gwendolyn) or a rich Jewish heritage (Mirah) with a background of tragedy.The movie itself overflows with beauty -- sumptuous rooms, colourful ball gowns, rambling mansions, even the brilliant Mediterranean. But it has substance as well, with excellent direction in moments both beatiful and hideous (the wedding night scene).In fact, the direction gets stronger as the movie progresses, such as Daniel's tightly-wound conversations with his mother, and the last few conversations with Gwendolyn. And the cinematography is excellent -- the shot of Mirah slowly descending into the dark river is exquisite and chilling, like something from a beautiful horror movie.Handsome Dancy is one of the reasons this movie works so well -- Daniel is a kind, almost saintly person, but Dancy manages to imbue him with the restless, yearning quality that the character needed. Garai is excellent with the immature, selfish girl who desperately wants to be better. And while May is not as conventionally pretty as Garai, her performance is much more striking, such as when Mirah tells Daniel about her father trying to sell her.""Daniel Deronda"" could have been a pompous mess with an annoying lead, but instead it's a magnificently nuanced, beautifully filmed story about finding out who you are -- and who you're destined for. Brilliant.",N/A
545850,"Yeah... Chances are, your local theatre group isn't going to trump this anytime soon. Yes, it's a viciously truncated version Of Shakespeare's play. But hell, this is a movie, folks. I seriously doubt you've committed the first folio to memory that well. In all honesty... nothing too important is ommitted and the taut pacing/implied sensuality makes up for The Bard's missing lines. Moreover, if you're going to chop any of Shakespeare's tragedies, this would be the one to hack at; if only because Iago's real motivations are never fully revealed... He hints at jealousy and The Moor's possible adaultery with his wife, Emilia... but those are rather too minor to warrant why he does what he does (he doesn't even like his wife that much...)I don't think Iago knows the real motivations for his villiany- he doesn't want to face himself, all the more reason to lose himself in a tangled web of inrigue... Branagh takes the role and runs with it masterfully: he's so alive and passionate when involved with the other characters and so quietly monotone and intensely sinister when delivering his soliloquies!Anyway, my amateur psych profiles aside, this is a wonderful film version.  The performances are as smoldering as they are riveting. Fishburne is his sensual best, Branagh is coldly intense and creepy, his stop-on-a-dime two-faced portrait of Iago is superb. The chick who plays Desdemona is competent, she suffers and dies well enough. The actress doing Emilia is great as well. Cassio is the dumb stud we all know and love... Everyone who's not Iago or Othello is more or less delegated to the background so the film can focus on their interaction and Iago's machinations.Well-paced and directed with great settings and locales and a lovely soundtrack that is understated in all the right places and bombastic in all the right places...If you've seen it, you know.

289708,"I watched this series when it first came out in 1990 on PBS, and was mezmerized by it, also studing U.S history at that time and having read a rather large Civil War book for a class project as well.  Now on weekends our PBS station has been reruning some episodes, and it sparked me to look it up here on amazon to see what prices were, which have come down tremendously, so I bought a set.  Now reflecting back 16 years later, this show is good for base history, but it also has the narration, music and organizations of a Drama.  I enjoyed the battle history and seeing the maps as the battles played out, but the narration got tiresome around tape 5.  And I know Shelby Foote is a smart man, and knows a lot about the civil war, but I just got so sick of his ""quotes"" of generals etc, no historical value in any of the quotes, and they got tiresome really quick for me.

We get your point -- Bettie did bondage videos......Nico B has the arrogance to say this a CULT FILM?  Cult films are not made, they happen vis a vis the public's perspective of a film.Nico B needs to do his research -- instead of wasting time on chasing down composers for that boring and redundent soundtrack, he needs to get his facts straight.The acting is really bad -- I am a native Tennesseean and I can tell you that nobody in Tennessee has the accent of Paige Richards.  Ditto the ""narrator"" who is not Paige Richards.  They all sound like they are from the deep south and very phony.  But the voice of Estes Kefauver (who was born and bred in Madisonville, Tennessee), with some sort of Teutonic accent was just over the top!I can't believe anyone would pay to see this in a theatre.  I can't believe I paid to buy this junk.The Bunny Yeager stuff of Paige Richards is OK  Let's see though, did Bettie Page have a Brazlian Wax, Pierced Ears, or Implants?  I think not.Paige Richards does look remarkably like Bettie Page in the face and figure (except for those implants).But after a few scenes, that portion of the DVD was so boring I did not even finish it.  Paige Richards is a really pretty woman, but she tries to hard when posing for Bunny -- some of those faces she makes tend to make her look as though she is passing some type of fetid gas into the air!I wish there were a 0 Star because this waste of a film is beyond terrible!Poor Bettie Paige.

566434,"This collection of banned and censored cartoons, as far as I am concerned, is worth a second look from an animation historical perspective. For entertainment purposes, however, this collection just is not very entertaining.To me, about the only cartoon on here worth a second viewing is the classic ""Scrub Me Mama With A Boogie Beat."" The rest of it, to me, was pretty forgetable.The reasons for these cartoons being banned include racism, violence, and sexism (so the video says).The ""Easy Does It"" was definitely a little on the risque side, as it does feature a well-endowed cigarette girl gettin' a backside slap (assumed - not actually seen) from a sexist banker who has the hots for a grocers leggy daughter. The story of that cartoon itself include the grocers daughter initiating contact with the banker to keep him from taking her dad's business into financial ruin - and it's obvious that her visiting the banker (with physical attributes) keep the banker off her dad's case. I agree this is not suitable for children, although this nothing worse than what we see on prime-time sitcoms regularly nowadays.Other cartoons here banned for alleged sexism include ""Cupid Gets His Man"" (naked cupids, but I somehow missed the potential offensiveness of them), ""Christmas Night"" (three men washing in a bathtub [with clothing on] has homosexual overtones - which I didn't get since none of them touched each other) and the military cartoons ""Booby Traps"" and ""Spies"" (sexist overtones featuring a WWII G.I. character - I just didn't like those two cartoons). The ""In a Cartoon Studio"" cartoon also shows a female character being abused for rejecting a male characters advances on her.""Scrub Me Mama With A Boogie Beat"" is just plain LOADED with black stereotypes including ebonic speech, laziness, shufflin' along (as opposed to walking), and a curvaceous black gal who get the black men's eyeballs all but poppin' out of their heads at the sight of the buxome babe in tight, see-through clothing. Keep in mind, though there is some racial stuff that was funny in the 1940's that would be viewed as more ""taboo"" today - and vice-versa.Sometimes it just depends on the audience when determining the potential offensiveness on stuff like this.There is some other ethnic stereotypes here, like drunk Irish cops (""Fresh Vegetable Mystery""), African children eating watermelon (""Making Stars""), and a mammy dressed in clothing reminiscent of slaves from the south (""Little Black Sambo"").There is violence in some of these cartoons, like the beheading of a character in ""Opening Night"", and the bull-whipping of a horse (and later the animal abuser) in ""Be Human"". But this violence was, in my opinion, not any more extreme then the guns and fighting we see on scores of other cartoons we see from MGM or WB.There is nothing in the 13 cartoons on this video that is any worse that what we see on South Park. If you want to look for look for other older cartoons (in addition to this video) that you won't see on today's television anymore, try looking for them at these websites:toontracker.comtoonzone.netbannedfilms.comebay.com (banned cartoons)couchpotatovcd.comoffthemarkcartoons.comAnd be sure to look for the cartoon ""So White and the Sebben Dwarfs"" if you can find it - that one is an absolute classic!",N/A

I have a hard time getting into new bands, my musical tastes are firmly cemented between the 1960s-1990s. Shinedown, however, has struck a chord with me because of a few reasons. Every member of the band is very talented, but singer Brent Smith is most impressive. The guy can belt it out and could (eventually) end up in the realm of Geoff Tate, Rob Halford, and Bruce Dickinson. The guy's a true vocalist...Their lyrics are thought-provoking and their songs are catchy...Oh and judging by this DVD they're a great Live act. This is far from the best concert DVD I've seen; After all, this DVD features only songs from the first album. But the guys have a polished live act and the camera work isn't bad. It's clear the crowd there was really digging the show. I'm not going to bother including the set list, because it's probably on here somewhere. The bonus features are interesting (two music videos; Simple Man & .45) and a Bonus Documentary, which takes a look at the band...Surprisingly, they all seem like nice genuine dudes who really love their fans. I don't know if I'd buy this DVD (I got lucky and found a place that had it to rent), but I will definitely buy the next DVD they put out (if they ever do). Hardcore fans of Shinedown will like it a lot more than just casual fans and if you're looking for material from the 2nd CD, you'll be very disappointed.GRADE: B+",N/A

960959,"Shot with a hand-held camera, `Lost Embrace' (`El Abrazo Partido') is about a small world in Buenos Aires, Argentina. It is the world seen from one young male Ariel (Daniel Hendler) whose mother has a lingerie shop in the `galleria,' small-sized shopping center in downtown. You meet colorful people there - Joseph, Ariel's brother who runs grocery store; Rita, sexy internet caf&eacute; manager who comes to Ariel's shop and `tries on' the merchandize there, and Osvaldo, who is so `obscure' that nobody notices he is there.But the film is in fact about Ariel himself, whose father left him and went to Israel while he was very young. (Like Woody Allen film, Ariel's Jewish roots play a significant role). Though Ariel's father sometimes calls his mother from Israel, Ariel has never met him in person. And probably he doesn't want to, for Ariel wants to get a Polish nationality in order to get out of this country and live in Europe.This small Argentine film might not appeal to you if you're waiting for twists and turns in the plot. Nothing big happens in `Lost Embrace.' Though, in his frequent voiceover, Ariel says he is going to leave the country, his brother (and we) know that he lacks the will to really do so, and perhaps no character want to leave this galleria, the comfortable corner in the wide world the time has forgotten. Even when some secrets are revealed, Ariel never screams or cries. We know he is deeply frustrated at the way he lives his aimless life, and no doubt he is feeling his pains somewhere in his heart, but he is kind of a character who would keep running in pain, instead of crying.I for one liked the characters and several episodes about themselves - such as Ariel's conversations with Korean shopkeepers, or the songs that his grandmother sings - but I also prefer more dynamic story with emotional power. There is story, emotion and power in `Lost Embrace' but they are often shown as if seen from the observer's viewpoint. Director Daniel Burman is a compassionate and careful observer, and he lets us feel the changes happening in Ariel, but the changes are presented in a subtle way, and you have to be careful to find them out.`Lost Embrace' is not a film for everybody. It is not about famous people or beautiful landscape. Though there is a story about a father-son relation, it is shown in a more realistic way, not in a soap-opera fashion. That is exactly the charm of this small film, and the small world in downtown Argentina it depicts.",N/A
641645,"Director and writer George Clooney did a commendable job in melding archival footage and convincing acting performances in his compelling film chronicling the stand taken by venerable television newscaster Edward R. Murrow against Senator Joseph McCarthy in the 1950's. David Strathairn was superb portraying the terse, serious, and dedicated chain smoking Murrow.  Murrow bolstered in his beliefs by the CBS news division and especially by producer Fred Friendly played by Clooney morally took a potentially suicidal, for his career, stand against the paranoic Communist witch hunt propagated by Wisconsin Senator McCarthy.Murrow was in part excoriated by media critics and his powerful boss at CBS, William Paley, played nicely by Frank Langella.  He displayed incredible fortitude in putting himself at loggerheads with the Red fearing senator, in effect putting his reputation on the line.Clooney's use of black and white cinematography gives the film a period piece quality reminiscent of television back in the 50's.  Supporting roles played by Robert Downey Jr. and Patricia Clarkson as newsroom members Joe and Shirley Wershba were well done.  Actor Ray Wise playing newscaster Don Hollenbeck who succumbs to the pressure of negative press over the station's stand against McCarthy was particularly effective in his role.",N/A

168955,"Solidly anchored in the superficial, non psychedelic part of the 60s, the perfectly named MATT HELM LOUNGE (Sony) is a four DVD set (The Silences, Murderers' Row, The Ambushers and The Wrecking Crew) that features Dean Martin as Matt Helm, the wise-cracking, boozing, smoking, singing, swinging, fighting, seducing secret agent who never gets his well-oiled hair mussed.Cool, urbane and loaded with an arsenal of handy double-entendres, Martin's Helm is a James Bond parody who fights evil geniuses with world dominating schemes all the while sorting through a bevy of good and bad beauties wearing exotic, often skimpy attire. That's the formula for these sexy, silly spy romps, replete with generous samplings of Martin's trademark crooning.The best of the lot is 1966's The Silencers. The first title in the series has Helm up against a villain who wants to take over the world by starting World War III.  Stella Stevens is his klutzy, knock-out cohort.It's interesting that these films with their then preposterous plots are now issues we have already faced or fears for which we are on alert.  For instance, in Murderers' Row, a diabolical mastermind threatens to incinerate the heart of Washington, D.C.  Remember the diverted 9/11 plane?

The characters, the double-crosses, the shifting allegiances, all were pulled off spectacularly.  The setting of the story around a high school student played nicely into the form by having the protagonist play fast and loose with the administration, local toughs, and a band of dealers who just completed a major sale while he tries to understand who killed an ex-girlfriend.  The ONLY issue I have is that while the detective noir aspect of Brick is flawless, the characters were all too confident and played too well to type to really be convincing as high school students.It also didn't hurt that there were little insider jokes referencing The Maltese Falcon, Miller's Crossing, and other great hardboiled movies.And for the reviewer wondering what a ""yegg"" is: a tough guy, often an ex-boxer, slumming for a crime boss.Very highly recomended.",N/A

916186,"Beauty ShopYou know, the more I think about it, the more I like Queen Latifah. For the overall uselessness of the movie Bringin' Down da House, that one scene where she transforms into a rich, upper class type public speaker just to show Steve Martin's character that she CAN do it, she just chooses NOT to, definitely shows a side of ""black culture"" that is much more relatable to-->the fact that (a lot/most/some?) choose that because that's how they WANT to identify themselves, and it's not meant to be confrontational at heart. It's like choosing to be a goth, or a punk, or all of those subcultures almost, conformingly anticonformist, grouping yourself in a similar minded alternative.So now we have this movie, where Queen Latifa plays Gina, a stylist whiz who feels underappreciated at her job so opens her own shop, and there she shocks and appalls the neighborhood by bringing in white clientele and white employees and letting them all enjoy the scenery. It's actually one of the strongest movies dealing with integration I think I've seen, basically because when everyone gives trouble to the the white girl, and the white girl's getting upset and disturbed by it, Gina just has to say to her, ""Hey, think how I felt in a white shop."" Indeed.Plus, when dealing with those pesky issues of representation that seems to hover over every mediated creation of ""black characters"", this one is pretty broad, from the black women who refuse to work with the white woman and leave, to the young ""white-speaking"" black girl who keeps on getting hit on by the jive-talking twelve-year-old, to the African culture versed man above them who, also, happens to know a thing or two about playing good piano.And of course it would be. From the makers of Barbershop, it has that same more critical look at black culture that loves it, and yet knows what it really is and where people on ""both"" sides take it too seriously. Barbershop was actually quite a wonderful film, mostly because of it's political incorrectness, but also because of the pale-skinned barber who points out that being black is what he wants, not what he has to be born into, and Cedric the Entertainer doing his ""Martin Luther King Jr. was a HO!"" bit was just too much.Now if only this film didn't have ... well... Kevin Bacon. I thought that having Kevin Bacon in it would make it amazing, but it really, really didn't. He's just too weird for a too lightly humored film. Instead, I'd like to point out that this movie has Andie McDowell in a fantastic role, so with that cast, it's got to have SOMETHING to it.--PolarisDiB",N/A

411057,"This HBO flick is highly recommended for overall quotable value, good laughs, some good acting, and some good laughs.Was this film written by a Gotti family member?  I don't know where to begin.  Suffice to say that the film is not nearly the sum of its parts.  There are some good scenes, some good acting by Assante as Gotti (why hasn't Assante been in other mob flicks or even on The Sopranos?).  Anthony Quinn, who needs subtitles, is not bad as Neil Dellacroce, who dies of that mysterious movie illness where the character gets old and coughs a lot before checking out.  And of course, we have any number of Wiseguy Acting Guild members, such as Sopranos actors Frank Vincent, Vincent Pastore, Tony Sirico, and Dominic Chianese.  William Forsythe looks nothing like Sammy 'The Bull' Gravano, and they make him the number one vilain in another of Forsythe's 'evil' roles.Gotti is portrayed as a gangster, yes, but also as some kind of pre-capitalist who spews wisdom about the 'parameters' of La Cosa Nostra, about 'the rules', and importantly, about members of his administration who are 'talking subversive'.  He is not pleased with Gravano due to his underboss' greed and to the unacceptable amount of legit money being made.  What kind of gangsters are making this much legit money?  Gotti rants about libertarian values, rails against the hypocrisy of the government and about white collar crime, and even goes so far as to correct one of his underlings' racial epithets (always loved that one) before he himself launches a few.As a realistic portrayal of Gotti, it's horrible, there's too much fiction, too many factual errors, utter nonsense being uttered by the characters, etc, etc.  But there's just a tremendous amount of quotable material, some great scenes, the requisite mob hits (apparently Paul Castellano was shot 50 times in slow motion) and a fantastic Assante hamming it up.  In 1998 a TV movie called Witness To The Mob appeared---an adaptation of Gravano's book 'Underboss'.  It's the perfect companion to this movie.  While Gravano is pure evil in this movie, in Witness, Gravano moralizes and Gotti is the man at fault.  And of course, some of the very same actors appear in both movies, only to die differently (Frank Vincent is shot in the head in this film before being blown up in a car bomb in Witness, his acting range fully explored).Just can't recommend this one enough.  The writers must have been under contract from the mob or perhaps under threat from the mob, but the absurdity is part of the charm.",Gotti VHS
444805,"The Graduate has become a classic film, one that makes all those `top 100 film' lists. It stars a young Dustin Hoffman as Benjamin Braddock, a young man from a wealthy family, who has just graduated from college. He is in limbo, unsure of what to do with his time and where life will lead him. The Robinson's are his parents' best friends and it is their daughter Elaine (Katharine Ross) who Ben's parents have earmarked as a partner for their son. However Mrs Robinson (played by a brilliantly predatory Anne Bancroft) has other plans and is set on seducing the nave young man. When Elaine returns from college, Ben falls for her and ends his relationship with her mother. Predictably Mrs Robinson reacts with hostility and sets out to ruin both his relationship with her daughter and his life.Simon and Garfunkle provide the music in their inimitable style and the title song, Mrs Robinson, was a huge hit for them. Director Mike Nichols managed, in this film, to capture the feel and mood of the 60's flawlessly and he deservedly won an Oscar for his work. The DVD itself has few extras, a documentary by the director, interview with Hoffman, some trailers and the usual subtitles. The picture and sound quality are good, what you would expect from the format. This is a film that has stood the test of time and is still worth watching today.",The Graduate

168375,"Despite the unoriginal premise (the movie Big recast with a woman), 13 Going on 30 is a very entertaining movie and this is due in large part to its star, Jennifer Garner, who brings to her role loads of charm. This movie is the perfect vehicle for the actress because it allows her to break away from the action hero persona that she cultivated with the T.V. show Alias and Daredevil and prove that she can do a romantic comedy.Garner, with her warm, disarming smile has a wholesome, girl-next-door quality that is quite endearing. She's beautiful but not in an unattainable way. She also has natural comedic ability, for example, in one scene, Jenna livens up her magazine's boring party with an impromptu dance to Michael Jackson's ""Thriller,"" inspiring others to get up and dance as well. Garner also has a very expressive face that is perfect for the broad comedy of this movie. She is willing to take risks and make fun of herself. She is also willing to put herself out there and is not afraid to appear goofy and this only makes her that much more appealing.13 Going On 30 is the victim of the dreaded double dip. If you already own the Special Edition version of the movie, the two new extras hardly warrant a re-purchase. Also, if you already own the previous edition you might want to hold onto it as the audio commentary by director Gary Winick and the commentary by producers Gina Matthews, Donna Arkoff-Roth, and Susan Arnold is not on this edition.New to this edition is ""Fashion Flashback: Into the 1980s"" that features teen models gushing about how much they love the ""retro"" look of the `80s. It tells you what to look for and where to track down ""authentic"" clothes of that era.""Making of a Teen Dream"" takes us through the making of the movie in a fun, breezy way that is customary of most press kit type featurettes. The cast speak admiringly about each other in this self-congratulatory extra.There is a ""Bloopers"" reel, a collection of blown lines and other assorted goofs that are quite cute.Also included are two music videos, one for Pat Benatar's ""Love is a Battlefield"" and another for ""Jessie's Girl"" by Rick Springfield that allows you to immerse yourself in pure `80s cheese.The most enjoyable extra is ""I Was A Teenage Geek."" The cast talk about what they were like in the `80s. Everyone tells amusing stories of what they were doing in high school with photos of what they looked like at the time.There is also an ""Alternate Beginning and Ending"" that features different actors playing Jenna and Matt when they were kids. The scene is about the same length as what is in the movie but is edited differently. We get more detail on Jenna's desire to be one of the popular girls. Thankfully, these were not used.Finally, there are 15 deleted scenes with more footage of Jenna and Matt at the magazine party and so on.

508726,"""Sleepless Town,"" is a very gritty and terrific crime-drama film. I have really liked everything by Takeshi Kaneshiro. Although I have not seen all of his work, he definitely has the talent and charisma to go a long, long way in the world of cinema. This film riveted me and pulled me in from the start. It is an absolute must watch. The film takes place in an area of Japan named Kabukichio. It is a place where there are different races and languages spoken. A place where hegemony over the area is in the hands of the crime bosses. But in order to keep control, without the different factions facing off in a war, truces are established, and lines are not to be crossed.Here we find the main protagonist, Kenichi, played aptly by (Takeshi Kaneshiro). Kenichi walks a very fragile line. He is half Japanese, and half Chinese. And although he himself is a dealer of stolen goods, and knows the rules, he must walk an even more delicate line thanks in part to his former business partner Fu-chun, who killed the right-hand man of the don of the Shanghai mafia. There are no loyalties in this crime-drama. Fu-chun, who has left town after causing this mess mysteriously returns. Why? What is his purpose?Suddenly, another intriguing character jumps into the plot. A mysterious woman named Natsumi Sato, played by (Mirai Yamamoto) Kenichi falls in love with her, and she with him. However, she will lie, cheat and steal--anything to further herself. Therefore, can Kenichi still trust her? But there is more to her and the crime lords that Kenichi has to deal with. Meanwhile, his former business partner Fu-chun wants something. What is it? This film gets more intriguing and mysterious as it moves along.

It is quick if you are pressed for time Allison Davis is an inspired aerobic instructor that is easy to follow.

The dance steps are involved, and might scare away someone who is dance challenged (like my husband, who normally does FIRM workouts with me but will not go near this one).  Also, the music sounded familiar.

963123,"I like the movie ""Jumanji."" I don't think it's a great film, but it was a fairly decent movie. The special effects haven't held up quite as well as they used to, but that's okay, that's just the way things work sometimes. With that in mind, I wasn't particularly looking forward to seeing ""Zathura."" Like ""Elf,"" the movie just looked too dopy and childish for me. However, like ""Elf,"" I walked away from ""Zathura"" quite surprised. I only then learned that the guy who directed ""Elf"" directed ""Zathura"" too.The storyline is simple: Boys who hate each other find board game, start playing, weird stuff happens, boys must learn to love each other if they are to survive. In this regard, ""Zathura"" is nothing special, as this story has been told multiple times before. What makes this movie worth seeing is that it is told in a very fun way. While ""Jumanji"" was a good movie, calling it a family film (and giving the film it's too flexible PG rating) was a joke, as that film was capable of terrifying kids. ""Zathura"" makes this a fun ride by establishing very early on that this is going to be a fun fantasy ride.The first thing that happens is a huge meteor shower takes place in the living room. The meteors fall everywhere, destroying the room, but the kids are unharmed. So while it looks like the kids are avoiding the meteors, it's really the meteors that are avoiding the kids. This scene does a great job in setting up the fact that this is all just going to be fun. As more disasters show up, there is always something to protect the kids, and (in a brilliant stroke of genius) some of the special effects are old fashioned. The old fashioned special effects (like the robot) helps establish the fantasy setting we are in.The actors all do a commendable job in the movie. There is no Oscar work to be found here, but what is in here works. Save for Tim Robbins in a very minor supporting role as the dad who doesn't have for his kids, the cast is made up entirely of unknowns. This is also okay, as we don't want anyone mistaking this movie for art. Still, it's a great family film, and even if you don't have kids it is quite and enjoyable ride in itself. Just remember: It's only a game.",Zathura
215164,"I first saw ""Ferris Bueller's Day Off"" in 1991, and I've LOVED it ever since.  I was so thrilled to see that Paramount was giving this classic film an upgraded DVD Special Edition.  Upon seeing it however, I must say that I'm pretty disappointed.  The extras, although enjoyable, are sorely lacking what they could and SHOULD be.  Most of the film's major stars (and sometimes even minor ones like Kristy Swanson and Richard Edson) provide some updated interviews that are fun to watch.  But, the bonus material and interviews featuring Mia Sara are all from 1986!  She obviously CAN'T be that busy these days, so doesn't it make sense that an updated interview with her could have been included?Also, the shooting script for this movie contains MANY deleted scenes and dialogue, some of which were a GREAT read and are bound to have been filmed.  Ferris going through the house looking for money in some STRANGE places (all while the Pink Floyd tune ""Money"" was playing), as well as Cameron's dad seeing his 1961 Ferarri being driven through Chicago's streets by the two parking garage employees would have been GREAT to see.  However, the ONLY deleted scene we get here is a behind-the-scenes version of the waiter at Chez Qui telling the trio that the food they were eating was pancreas (which of course was referred to later by Ferris in the taxi).  No true special edition DVD should be without a deleted scenes section.  VERY disappointing.Next, this edition (like the original) does NOT include a theatrical trailer.  It's rare for even a bare bones DVD not to include at least one trailer, but nearly UNHEARD of for a special edition!  It's bound to still exist, and I can't beleive that it's THAT hard to find that they could not have dug it up for this ""special"" edition.Finally, the original DVD, while lacking a trailer, DID include a GREAT feature-length commentary track by writer/director John Hughes.  However, that commentary track is NOT included here!  That was either a severe oversight or a downright mean move by Paramount.  How hard would it have been to reproduce it here?  In effect, its omission forces anyone who bought the original DVD and wants to upgrade to the special edition to keep the original instead of selling or trading it, all because they want to retain the commentary.  Paramount should have at least made it possible that owning this new DVD would provide the most complete ""Ferris"" experience presently possible by itself, but without the original's commentary it doesn't.In summary, if you bought the original DVD, then I advise you to keep it and just rent this new version to give the special features a look.  Save the rest of what you would otherwise spend on this to put towards something more worthwhile.  If you have NOT bought the original DVD however, then this would be a worthwhile purchase to own the extras that were not present on the original.  But, do rent the original to give a listen to that AWESOME commentary track by John Hughes.",N/A

Their characters are the funniest in the movie. They will really make you laugh.I highly recommend this movie as family entertainment. By the way I do not think it is valid to compare this movie with other Disney classics. Pixar has started a new type of animated movies that is a league of its own and I am sure they will withstand the test of time becoming thus classics.",N/A
823716,"I don't for the life of me understand why critics have been so negative toward this film. It is a jewel of a movie, a romantic comedy that succeeds in both areas.This was the last film that the late former married couple, Sandra Dee and Bobby Darin made together, and it is one of their best.Joan Howell (Dee, adorable as always) is a struggling actress who works as a maid-for-hire. Tom Milford (Darin, handsome and charming)is a playboy business man. They seem to have little in common, except for the fact that Joan cleans his apartment (of which they are both unaware). After several run-ins (literally) the pair decide to go on a date. Humilated at the thought of taking him back to her cramped apartment which she shares with her wisecracking roommate, Audrey (the hilarious Nita Talbot), she decides to pretend that the apartment she is cleaning is her place, but what she doesn't realize is that it is Tom's apartment! Things escalate from there as a bewildered Tom goes along with her, all the while driving his poor harassed boss Harvey Granson (the one and only Donald O'Connor)insane, as he desperately wants to retrieve his priceless (but ugly) paintings from Tom's home. Of course, Joan discovers his deception and wants to get even, although she has fallen in love with him, and he has fallen in love with her. Wonderfully comedic complications and consequences take place.Larry Storch is priceless as Joan and Audrey's scrappy neighbor Luther, and Leo G. Carroll has a nice role as the owner of a pawnshop. James Westerfield nearly steals the show as a cop that Tom continually runs into, Robert Strauss and Ben Lessy are hysterical as two middle-aged bartenders with very vast imaginations, and Reta Shaw has a funny little bit as a miffed old lady.All in all, irresistible romantic fun! The title tune alone (written and performed by Darin) is in a class all by itself. Tons of fun, don't pass it up!",N/A

886379,"I must say that Futurama is a very interesting show; While comparing this show and Family Guy's fourth season (not the previous three seasons really), I can say that Futurama is much funnier and more bearable than FG's new season. So after seeing this DVD came out, I thought ""What the hell. Kick in $10 and you won't have to buy the Volume sets.""Like the FG Freakin' Sweet Collection, Futurama's Monster Robot Maniac Fun Collection is a compilation of four episodes (one episode per season) hand-picked by the creator himself. Here are my given thoughts on these episodes:Hell is Other Robots is probably the funniest episode of the first season, where Bender, while trying to clean up his act, joins a robot religion group which irritates his friends at the Planet Express. Plenty of gags and music to keep you happy. 9/10Anthology of Interest I is one of my all-time favorites; I always enjoy 10-minute sketches compiled into a half-hour episode like Simpsons' Treehouse of Horror and Family Guy's Viewer Mail. Fry, Leela, and Bender lend their wonders in a ""what-if"" machine; Bender wonders what if he was 500 feet tall (obvious to see him on the DVD cover art), Leela wonders what if she was a little more impulsive, and Fry wonders what if he never fell into the cryogenic freezer and never come into the future. 10/10The Emmy-award winning Roswell that Ends Well follows Fry accidentally opening a time portal by a pot of popcorn while at a supernova explosion in a microwave and transporting the entire Planet Express Crew into Roswell, New Mexico in the year 1947, the time where Fry's grandfather was alive...well, at least Fry tries to keep him that way. Funny episode, well-written, period. 9/10One thing I like about this show is that unlike Family Guy, which would just be a string of gags without any thick plotline, Futurama would concentrate on the characters' evolution and create such solid concepts. That's where The Sting comes in. Leela keeps thinking that Fry is alive and is communicating through her dreams after Fry is instantly killed by a giant bee.  The bulk of this episode focuses on the Fry/Leela relationship; Clever and surreal, and while not as funny as the other episodes on this disc, it still has heart. 8/10Now on to the extras: We get an overall disc intro, as well as individual intros per episode, by creator Matt Groening, developer David X. Cohen, a few producers, and voice actors Billy West and John Dimaggio. We also get a ""lost"" animatic of Hell is Other Robots with an optional commentary by the same people. This DVD doesn't offer much really, but these extras at least save this from being another bare-bones release. 6/10Hardcore fans may appreciate the extras in the DVD, but the main focus is for newcomers for the shows, and of course, for casual fans. I still don't feel like buying the season sets yet, simply because the show is still rerunning on Adult Swim and TBS.Overall score 7/10Note to fans: The Futurama crew's called back to do four Direct-to-DVD movies so the show still has a future!",N/A
781873,"After so much success with Talking Letters by Leapfrog, we went ahead and bought this one and were just as pleased.  Talking Letters taught recognition of each letter and the sound it makes;  this DVD teaches how to put those sounds together to make simple 3 letter words.My son was roughly 2.5 when we bought this, and he quickly learned to read 3 letter words.  When my daughter's friends came over, my daughter liked to spell words with letter tiles and have him read them to the genuine amazement of her playmates.Of course, if you want your child to fluently read a variety of books, it will take more than this Leapfrog series of DVDS (to date there are 4 reading ones and 1 math one).  However, this dvd UNQUESTIONABLY gives kids a head start.  It makes the material fun to learn and easy to remember, and who can quibble with that??I have also recommended this series to several friends whose kindergarteners were having trouble with letter/sound recognition and the idea of blending letters to make words.  The dvds helped all of their children make significant progress towards mastery of these concepts.I will warn adults that, while certainly not on a par with Teletubbies or Boo-bah, the DVD can be annoying, with its high pitched cutsie voices, bland graphics, big-eyed frogs, and silly songs. But kids, particularly toddlers, don't see it that way.This series, and this dvd in particular, is a great guilt-free way to grab 30 minutes to fold laundry or get dinner on the table.",LeapFrog: Talking Words Factory

455105,"Mulan in many ways is probably one of the better ones that Disney made before making some really subpar fluff. Pocahontas was disappointing and Hercules was a bit too light-hearted to be taken seriously. Even with comic relief, Mulan wants to be taken seriously too and that's why it works. Not a classic really but still well made.Film's set in China with Mulan trying to impress the matchmaker to find a husband. Only things don't go so well, and things get worse when Mulan's ailing father is called into war with the Huns. Not wanting to risk her father's life, Mulan takes his armor and sword and rides off. Her family guardians don't want her to leave so they summon a dragon, only they get Mushu instead, a very tiny lizard-like wisecracker. Along for the ride is Cri-Kee, a lucky bug, to help save the Emperor.Disney was heavily starting to use CG more often and combining traditional animation and it's still impressive to see. Each Disney release usually has that one big action scene or animation showcase: the dance in Beauty and the Beast, stampede in Lion King and the Hydra fight in Hercules. Here we get an avalanche and it still looks cool. My only problem is there's not really enough wide shots, we're very close to it and would've been nice to see all of it.Eddie Murphy in many ways is like a more tolerable Robin Williams. They're both very manic and hyperactive comedic wise but Eddie's not as energetic, which is why Mushu works, he knows how to dial it down. The rest of the cast is quite good, including Ming-Wa, known from the Joy Luck Club and ER. The other cast you probably wouldn't recognize since it's not huge like James Woods or Mel Gibson, which works just fine.One thing that doesn't work with the film is the songs. There's nary a Circle of Life or Never Had a Friend Like Me in the entire thing. They're not really all that memorable and there's a certain predictableness to the structure of them. At least Hakuna Matata was different to Be Prepared just as Be Our Guest was different to Gaston. Here, you're almost unsure whether it's even different songs and you'd have to think ""well it does sound a bit different"".Mulan probably won't enter the Disney classic catalogue like Lion King or Bambi but it's still one of their better made ones.",Mulan VHS

784040,"Robert (Nathan Fillion) and Molly Graves (Chandra West) are trying to keep it together after the death of their young daughter.  He is a writing who is now unable to write anything, and so the couple end up at his late father's cabin in the small rural community of Reedsville.  Molly is haunted by a terrible dream and is doing a bit more than contemplating suicide.  Finding that Molly has loaded his father's old shotgun, Robert takes the gun and run out of the hunting cabin into the woods.  This seemed like a good idea at the time, but in the woods he stumbles across a strange scene: A sheriff has dragged a handcuffed young woman out of his cop car in the middle of the forest and is about to kill her.  Robert intervenes, which means he and Molly are suddenly up to their necks in the cesspool of small town corruption.Robert has saved the life of Rae Baines (Emmanuelle Vaugier), and of course he wants to know why the sheriff was about to bash her head in with a rock.  An explanation is not forthcoming, and Robert's suspicions are aroused when he discovers $200,000 and some lewd photographs of Rae in the sheriff's car.  Clearly there is something rotten going on in Reedsville and since they are in the middle of nowhere, Robert has nobody he can trust.  This actually works out because apparently nobody in Reedsville is trustworthy, from Mayor Block (Daniel Baldwin) on down.  But Robert and Molly are in way over their heads.  At least their martial problems no longer seem that that important.Obviously the main attraction for this 2003 direct to DVD movie is Nathan Fillion, who has a legion of fans because of his starring role on Joss Whedon's ""Firefly,"" which translated into the theatrical film ""Serenity.""  But unless you harbor dreams that he is going to show up on your doorstep and propose to you out of a clear blue sky, this is clearly a rental.  Fillion and West both provide fine performances, but Vaugier cannot carry off the shifts required to keep stirring up the plot in this one.  Fortunately, the rest of the characters keep things fairly low-keyed, so things never descend into caricature, but the initial set up slowly descends into fairly standard action, including a gunfight where people are shooting in and out of a house without bothering to use the windows.  Except for a handful of trailers there are no special features on this DVD, which just reinforces that ""Water's Edge"" is essentially a curiosity for Fillion's fans.",Water's Edge
389898,"A film noir starring Deanna Durbin may seem as natural as eating an oyster with a splash of chocolate syrup, but if you're adventurous, well, somebody has to be the first to try it. Actually, the movie's a pleasant romp. Lady on a Train is a comedy mystery with some nice noir characteristics...shadows, trains, bodies and a climax in a darkened office building that would make Dick Powell feel right at home.Nikki Collins (Durbin) is a society deb from San Francisco coming in on the train for a visit to New York. As the train pulls into Grand Central, she casually looks out the window of her compartment and sees an elderly gentleman in an office across the way having his head bashed in by a crowbar-wielding murderer. She can see the victim's face, but not the assailant's. There are two things we need to know about Nikki. First, she's an energetic, confident young woman who is as determined as they come. Second, she loves mysteries. In fact, she was reading Wayne Morgan's ""The Case of the Headless Bride"" when she looked out the window. She goes to the police but they don't take her seriously. Plus, it's a few days before Christmas and no one is looking for more work than they already have. What's an heiress to do? Nikki looks up Morgan's address and pesters and prods him into using his skills as a detective to help find the killer. Nikki isn't fazed when Morgan (David Bruce) tries to tell her he's an author, he's shy, he's faint-hearted and he's no detective. She's determined to enlist his help, but in the meantime she's learned who the victim is, a very rich man. And she learns not only where he lived, but that his family is saying the man died accidently in a fall. So off she goes to the family mansion in the dead of night with snow starting to sift down...and just happens to be mistaken for Margo Martin, a singer at The Circus nightclub who was the ""fiance"" of the dead man. Wouldn't you know it, the old man's will leaves nothing to his two nephews, the eccentric and courtly Jonathan Waring (Ralph Bellamy) and the charming and untrustworthy Arnold Waring (Dan Duryea), but everything to Margo.Nikki has to deal with Danny, the Waring's thug of a chauffeur, and Mr. Saunders, the cold-eyed proprietor of The Circus who always carries a large white cat cradled in one arm. She finds she has to keep impersonating Margo, even if it means she has to sing ""Night and Day"" and ""Give Me a Little Kiss, Will You, Huh?"" as part of Margo's act. Tailing after her, like a small tug in the wake of a cruiser, is Morgan. I think they're starting to be attracted to each other.Up to now the movie has been amusing, light-weight and very much a vehicle for Deanna Durbin. She's no longer the little girl with a wonderful voice, as she was in the Thirties and Early Forties. She's a grown-up, and the studio is showing her off as a romantic lead who has a sense of humor. She's impeccably photographed, stylishly dressed and confident as all get out. It all pays off in the last 15 minutes when Nikki finds herself in the same office building where the killing took place. She's got both nephews looking for her, and one of them knows where the crowbar is hidden and intends to use it. There's the garage with the creaking car lift, the great storage floor where mounds of grain are piled, there are all the empty offices and hallways...and everything is dark and shadowed. Nikki keeps her cool, although she's quite happy when Morgan finally shows up to help save her. ""Oh, darling,"" she tells him afterwards, as he faints, ""you were wonderful."" Could the movie end without a marriage? And we know Deanna Durbin has grown up when, just before we see ""The End,"" there's a charming moment of sexual innuendo on the train taking Nikki and Morgan, newly married, to San Francisco.Deanna Durbin never seemed to take herself too seriously; she was always ready for a pratfall in the mud or a joke at her expense. She may not have had Judy Garland's overwhelming charisma, but she came close for a lot of people. More importantly, she didn't have Garland's edgy sense of an impending neurotic breakdown. Durbin was the girl next door with a sunny disposition, a great sense of humor and with a bit of the tomboy about her. In 1948, when she was 27, she announced her retirement. She and her husband, who directed this film, moved to France, where she still lives. She has never shown any interest in her movie-making past. She has never made another movie, has refused all requests for interviews and photographs, and has devoted herself to living a sane life. Good for her.The studio surrounded her in this film with some excellent character actors. In addition to Duryea and Bellamy, there's George Coulouris, Allen Jenkins, Edward Everett Horton, Samuel S. Hinds and William Frawley. And in a small role is Patricia Morrison, who three years later would be wowing the crowds singing ""I Hate Men!"" in Kiss Me Kate.This movie is available in a good-looking VHS tape and, on DVD, as part of the Deanna Durbin Sweetheart Pack.",Lady On A Train VHS

The ending might be great but we only got through a half an hour of the movie - waiting for the tone to change.

It is a bit far-fetched, but if you're in the mood for mindless entertainment to take you away after a horrible day of work, this flick will do the trick. Also, if you like Ryan Reynolds, he's hilarious in this. As a side note to the other ladies, you get to see him naked which is always a wonderful plus in my book. He looks gorgeous! Jerry O'Connell's character seems very similar to that of his character in Tomcats, but he's still great fun. Another thing I really liked was how they showed Jerry O'Connell's meeting in the airport with the girl of his dreams from his point of view as well as later on in the film, from her point of view. I thought that was a nice touch. Though certainly quite far from the best movie I've ever seen, for the price (found it in the $5.50 bin at Wal-Mart) it's a great addition to any DVD collection.",N/A
127622,"My two favorite movies of all time (ones I could watch over and over) are Titanic and Goodfellas. A die-hard fan must have this set. I received it as a Christmas gift and one must devote several days to really go through the entire set. There are five different ways to watch the movie alone: 1) The regular way, as it was released; 2)with commentary by James Cameron, 3)with commentary by the cast and crew 4) with historical commentary (truly appreciated by historians such as myself) and with the ""making of the movie/how they did it"" scenes interspersed. That alone would take one uninterrupted day. Then you can watch all of the deleted scenes which, in my opinion, should have been left in. Not one of them is garbage and some are very helpful in tying things together, like how Rose went from looking pristine to disheveled before she decided to jump off the ship in the beginning, or what happened to Lovejoy. There are many, many more extras that I cannot begin to tell how great they are, including the entire 45 min special on the making of the movie that aired on tv. There is also the alternate ending which did have one great line that should have been added into the final release - where Rose tells Brock ""You look for treasure in all the wrong places, Mr. Lovett. Only life is priceless. And making each day count.""So, go count your money, make your day count, and go buy this special collector's edition so you can give the regular dvd to a relative or friend.",Titanic VHS
598546,"I don't know anime but I know what I like. I liked Hayao Miyazaki's Spirited Away, and a lot of other people must have too, because this particular anime won an Academy Award.Chihiro is moving a to a new house, and soon she'll have to start a new school too. She is not happy about this at all. On the way to their new house in their car, her father decides to take a shortcut through a forest full of strange shrines and statues. The road they take ends all of a sudden at a tunnel, which they follow through to what appears to be an abandoned village full of restaurants. They find one of these restaurants filled with delicious food, which Chihiro's parents sit down and begin to eat. Chihiro tries to get them to stop but they don't, and soon turn into pigs. Night falls on the town, and the restaurants become filled with spirits, come to feast and to relax. It turns out that this place is part of a bathhouse complex for spirits, run by a very large headed woman.  Chihiro doesn't want to be turned into a little piglet girl, so she is forced to get a job at the bathhouse. While she works in this thriving colourful place, she will meet many strange and interesting beings, make all sorts of friends, and uncover several mysteries. Changing schools is easy compared to all this business!It seems to be a trend in Japanese films I've noticed that they don't really explain what's going on in great detail. The ins and outs of things are really only divulged on a need to know basis. They expect you to catch up as you go, which is basically what Chihiro, our main character has to do too in this strange world. There are stacks and stacks of ideas here. It's a very colourful, very imaginative place, with full of weird and fascinating creatures and beings. They don't only look interesting, but many of them have a very interesting motion, if that makes sense. They move in a unique way, thanks to some clever animation. Check out the ""Stink Spirit"" and the mud and gas flowing from his mucky body. Check out how the boiler man uses his ""four-arm"" strength without batting an eyelid (not that you'd be able to see his eyelids, he's wearing glasses). The score is good too, orchestral, though unlike some recent Western films, doesn't get in the way and does actually enchance what's going on.I've been going through Miyazaki's back catalog of films lately, and I'm noticing a few themes and motifs going through his work. Here in Spirited Away we have a dramatic scene around a simple flight of stairs, just like in ""Howl's Moving Castle"", which he'd do later. Also like he'd go on to do in Howl's, there are curses that transform people and people who can turn into flying creatures. There's a lot of flying in his films, actually (""Nausicaa"",""Porco Rosso""). I kind of thought ""Porco Rosso"" too when I saw the parents turned into pigs. What an odd world the man must have going on in his head. Got a few more to hunt down and watch of his, and I very much wonder what I'll see next.Anyone interested in a good fantasy, interesting animations or some fresh imagination, I recommend you check this film out.",N/A

Christians are put into some sort of prison camp until they agree to take the mark of the beast, or get executed.The moral is that it's better to die as a martyr than to survive in AntiChrist society and end up in hell for denouncing your faith. This intention of this movie is not to entertain, but to scare the viewer into becoming a Christian - or if you're already a Christian - stick to your faith, or else.... This is a message that only true religious zealots can sympathise with. It is an insult to anyone who has ever lived under oppression and fought back, rather than just lay down and die, for a supersticious fear of eternal damnation.

920472,"This TV-like drama on racism in LA is saved from banality by some fine performances by some of the actors. The problem lies in the contrivances of the plot that makes not entirely credible connections between characters who might not otherwise meet. Another weakness is the way the characters spell everything out--no mystery here about how they feel because what they say out loud is all there is--no underlying mystery or nuance. By supposedly offering a take on the racist tendencies in all of us, the film manages to offer a number of racial stereotypes. A disappointing choice for best picture, a way for Hollywood to congratulate itself. I originally rated this film with 2 stars but now that it was awarded the Oscar, I have given it 1 star for being ludicrously overrated by the Academy.

426587,"Sam Simms (Sinbad) is an unorthodox Secret Service agent.  The Secret Service assigns Agent Simms to protect the President's son, Luke Davenport (Brock Pierce of ""Might Ducks""), code named Prince.  Luke has managed to dispose of several previous Secret Service agents by driving them crazy, including Agent Woods (Timothy Busfield of ""Thirtysomething"" and ""The West Wing"").The movie tries to portray Luke as a child ignored by his famous mother and father and unable to have a normal childhood.  Though I empathize with Luke a little, he also generally acts wimpy.  However, thirteen-year-old Luke has stirrings of normality as he gains a huge crush on classmate Katie Warren (Erin Williby in her final role) and has a run-in with the class bully.  After the run-in with class bully Rob (Zachery Ty Bryan), Luke and Agent Simms begin to bond, and this movie really takes off.Much of the movie is humorous, as it was intended to be.  Most of the humor works, making this movie generally enjoyable.  Sinbad steals the show, as you might expect.  Sinbad mixes slapstick and one-liners that only occasionally clunk.  Sinbad makes Luke Davenport look good and sparks life into the plot.As with many Disney movies of this type, there are serious undertones.  The movie becomes most serious near the end when Luke Davenport runs away from the White House and encounters a life threatening situation.  Secret Service agents are in a panic as they try to locate the President's son.  Fortunately, Agent Simms, just fired from the Secret Service for aiding Luke in going to a school dance, has a way of finding Luke that only Agent Simms knows about.  The end of this movie is nicely plotted and enjoyable to watch.I enjoyed watching Sinbad in this movie.  Sinbad's comedy was generally fun, and he handles himself well.  Most of the cast did very well.  I would have replaced Luke Davenport with another actor, or would have had him perform with more confidence in school.  Luke Davenport ran rings around the Secret Service and yet he was unable to keep from embarrassing himself.  The plot was agreeable, with an action ending that provided a nice capstone to the comedy.  There is some mild violence that generated a PG rating, but this movie should be suitable for most family members down to about age 7 or 8.  Enjoy!",First Kid VHS

Among this host are not only the captain and the ship's doctor, but also the very young midshipman who loses an arm early on in the film, yet surmounts his disability with great dignity and pluck, the older midshipman paralyzed by his own fears, which end up costing two lives, and the ever grumbling Killick, Aubrey's servant, whose running commentary provides some comic relief.  Add to that a great score, full of classical music, and fabulous photography and special effects (especially the effects of canon fire at night and in fog) and what's not to love!In addition to the action scenes and blood and guts, the film explores quiet moments of ship life, from the opening scenes of the sleeping crew, through scenes of the doctor and captain playing string duets to the doctor engaged in his scientific pursuits both on the ship and on the Galapagos Islands.  There is a wealth of detail about shipboard life in the Georgian navy and of the organization of its personnel.The interpersonal conflicts and interactions are believable and memorable.  But probably the most impressive thing about the movie is the study it presents in the choices that may confront a leader in wartime.  From the light-hearted ""lesser of two weevils"" moment we are led through several episodes that illustrate the brutal truth that lies behind the joke.  In war the leader must often choose the lesser of two evils:  to sacrifice one life to save the other 196, to punish insubordination even when you don't want to do it for the sake of ship discipline, to sacrifice one's mission in order to possibly save the life of the ship's surgeon who is also your friend.  These moments are uncomfortable and even heart breaking to watch (especially when themed with the music of Vaughan Williams ""Fantasy on a theme by Thomas Tallis"") as the viewer is torn between sympathy and revulsion.In my opinion, this is one great movie which ought to satisfy both the action lovers and the thinkers.",Master and Commander: The Far Side of the World

The people featured in it are interesting, and the issues they deal with are interesting, so I have no quarrel with what the other good reviews of it here are saying. BUT, I don't see this as very visually erotic, if that's what you're looking for. The sexy scenes in it are very brief, and some episodes hardly have any such scenes at all. Thus, it's a very good show, but make sure it's the kind of show you're looking for.",N/A

They cut the overture, intermission, entra'ce and exit music from this beautiful film.  The music in this film is what carries the story along and for some reason MGM must of had a brain freeze.  Also what gives with the 2.0 for sound?  I saw this in it's wonderful 70mm 6-channel stereo sound.  The kind of sound that will never be brought back to any theatre screen.

642395,"Certain films just scream a purchase to me, even blind buys. The Fly and Dr Strangelove were pure blind buys and I didn't regret them. Sometimes though a film comes out and you just have to test the waters. Well going to the video store, I found out I got a free rental so I was very curious about Hostel so got that. Well, that saying of ""I want those 90 minutes back"" certainly applied to me. ""Scariest movie in a decade""? Liars.2 Americans and a Icelandic friend are in England backpacking looking for, what else? Women, particularly soon-to-be naked willing women. They overhear a story of a place that has incredibly easy girls who just love American accents. Well getting there, they meet 2 girls and soon they get suckered in to an odd place: people who pay to torture and kill people for a price, and wouldn't you know it? Americans fetch a mighty fine price.Like Land of the Dead, Texas Chainsaw Massacre remake, the Saw films and Wolf Creek, the film tries to horrify by showing disgusting images such as severed limbs or any other nasty business. Hostel doesn't delve into it right away but there's still a kind of pointless feel to it all. When the carnage starts happening, I can just imagine the filmmakers going nuts because they just wanted to make a violent movie. Gore can be used in a more artistic fashion such as war films but here it just feels violent just for the sake of it.What piqued my interest was this guy at the college mentioned the film and one of the gory shots and a woman in the class said ""every guy his age should see that film"". Whether she meant it as ""boys will be boys"" who will see those nudity/violence filled movies or it shows commentary on a thing apparently guys love to do: go overseas and bed ""hot European chicks"". To be honest, I never was into that, preferring the romance and chase angle but this is a commentary and it's a well-told one at that, it's just too bad it's on a ridiculous and pointless movie.If you want good horror movies, check out the Exorcist or the Shining or Carrie but if you're into gory stuff, you'll love it. Me? I want my free rental back.",Hostel
961002,"After watching this flick, I had to ask myself why.  Why did I think this would be even entertaining?  Why did I pass up other movies that I've actually heard of to watch this?  I suppose I don't really have answers, but I will shy away from such movies in the future.Okay, the movie had promise.  The plot sounded good.  The background sounded really good.  If this was a true story (the sanitarium, anyway), it would be an interesting bit of history.  I guess I should have known the acting would be subpar.  But the movie as a whole was subpar...a true triple bogey.There were a few good scares here and there.  The problem was that these scares were shown three, four times.  It stopped being frightening after the first time.  The credits state that the film was ""shot, cut, and directed by.""  That, at least, was accurate.  There was much cutting and pasting.  Flash backs, flash forwards, flash whatevers.  I would bet that the 90+ minute movie consisted of 50 minutes of actual footage.I do not recommend this movie.  I found myself hoping it would be over.  The ending was not good...just a cheap, ""bet you didn't see that coming"" scene that elisted a yawn from me.",Death Tunnel
472494,"First and foremost, this movie is meant to be particularly disturbing.  As such, I already can say that this is not a younger-crowds film, and is definitely R equivalent.  Even more then that though, I'm still having trouble grasping whether it's my kind of film, and all the while, I just try to grasp the story in it's entirety.The plot is like this.  In the days where pop-idols were supposedly pure, Mima Kirigoe retires, and begins anew in acting as a way to fit into the ever-changing business of stardom.  However, this may mean compromising all she knows, and giving up what she loved.  Even more then this, murderous minds follow, as the world Mima once knew collapses, and the new world twists and turns into that of nightmares.Psychological thriller is one way to put it, as it clear delves into the minds, characters and viewers alike.  However, many deeper films that I like have a relative point; and regretfully, for my tast at least, I cannot find that sense of closure I love.  That's not giving away the ending in the least bit, because I am merely discussing the overall.However, if you feel mature enough to attempt a relatively complex and adult plot, about a girl dealing with a definitely complex world, then this is all yours, and hopefully it may muse you.",Perfect Blue rated edition  VHS
967628,"But what the hell kind of species is it, anyway?Let's boil ""Marebito"" down: it's either,1)A sordid, turgid, dingy chronicle of a man's descent into loneliness, fear, madness, and the foulest abomination; or,2) It's like this: ready? Imagine you toil uneasily, for a pittance, for a meager wage that keeps you in Ramen noodles and rental payments, and you live in some dirty, foul-smelling little dirtwater dungeon off a freeway somewhere.And you're obsessed.You're obsessed with the notion, the idea, the fancy---that there might be vast subterranean caves and dungeons and abbatoirs and oubliettes stretching out for Stygian MILES beneath your humble abode. And in all those curving, twisting, writhing dark tunnels, and holes, and sawtooth death traps, down below the festering, breathing, hulking, sweating, teeming, whoring City---there might be Something.Something, you know, that can teach you tricks about your deepest Obsession: Fear.So let's be generous: let's give failed Tokyo cameraman Masuoko (the sublime, dingy, scruffily bearded Shinya Tsukamoto) his due, and say it's all about the Caverns, the vast, inky depths, that lurk, coiled, beneath his sad little studio apartment. Fine? Yes?Good. Anyway, our Man Masuoko is totally impelled by his conviction that he should, at the very least, see the source of the mind-blasting fear that impelled a subway transient to stick a knife into his eye-socket. The whole idea here: what did he see? Can I see it? Will I stick a pen-knife deep into my eyeball? Do I have wayyyyyyy too much time on my hands?So our hero stakes out the subway, figures the best possible entry point to the Horror, and penetrates the vast global abyss-spanning cavern-network into the Stygian recesses that lurk beneath all of the cities of Earth.Seriously.Takashi Shimizu (who helmed up The Grudge), pretty much tears open a portal to the Nightworld with ""Marebito"", plunges you in, turns out the lights, and leaves you without a guide. To either burrow deeper, or fumble around for the exit.Our Man burrows deeper, finds something curvy, and bound with shackles, and exiled to a forlorn cave, and fleshy, soft, helpless.Naturally, our Photographer sets her free, and leads her up into the sun-drenched haunts of Tokyo.And watches her, with the help of all his hidden cameras. Intently. Obsessively. Did I mention she's naked, and writhes around on the floor, and skulks beneath the bed, and stays away from bright lights, and has razor-sharp teeth, this precious little feminine find that Masuoka finds on the far periphery of what he calls the ""Mountains of Madness"", the far stomping grounds of Shaky Reason?She has razor-sharp teeth. For, you know, rending flesh.And she's up to all sorts of nasty things, all captured, in high definition, by the unblinking, unflinching eye of the camera.Anyway, Fear starts crawling all over the place: Fear gets hungry, lusts for blood, lusts entirely out of an appetite that our boy Masuoka has no clue how to control.And then there are the fabled, fearful DETROS---the ""Detrimental Robots"", who police the Tokyo Underworld, though they're far less like any Robots I've ever seen and far more like some kind of inhuman toad, lurking in that phantom expanse between the passage of the second hand and the waking minute.""Marebito"" is a chilly, helping serving of frozen Grue, and Despair, and Obession, all the worse because the brazen, harrowing, Underworld Journey may be nothing more than than the figment of a diseased mind in the terminal throes of a murderous insanity.That said: the Girl, the Fear, that you brought up from the Caverns---she has razor-sharp teeth.

173008,"I grew up on the original Battlestar Galactica, but even as a kid, I knew I was being pandered to with robot dogs and flying motorcycles and a cute kid hanging around on a military ship.But the premise -- robots all but wipe out humans elsewhere in the galaxy, and a ragtag fugitive fleet makes its way towards the semi-mythical Earth while pursued by the relentless Cylons -- was sound.Jump forward to 2004, and the new incarnation of the series. Most of the characters are reimagined, even if they fit into the same general niches -- two of them are even women now -- and the entire affair takes itself much more seriously. No robot dogs wrestling cute kids on the floor of a military cruiser here.Likewise, the special effects are a major leap forward and the dogfights in space are shot in bar-raising documentary style fashion, making them feel much more immediate and dangerous.The tweaks to the Cylons, both toasters and a new series that look like humans, make them much more interesting and frightening, and the changes to their human collaborator make him more than a joke. (Although Baltar is still a joke, much of the time.)The acting, especially by Edward James Olmos and Grace Park, is also miles beyond the original cast (although the original Apollo has a recurring role in the new series, playing very much against type).But ...(You knew there'd be a ""but,"" didn't you?)But the writing is sloppy at times to the point of carelessness. I'm not one to nitpick minor details like the names of characters' never-seen parents or what have you (although it'd be nice if all the characters stopped calling the NCO ""sir""), but major plot points appear and disappear out of the ether.At the end of the miniseries (included in this DVD package), Commander Adama receives a note in his quarters stating that Cylons look like humans now, and noting how many models there are. Who left this note? How did they know the information and why share it with him? And, most importantly, why wasn't this ever followed up on?Likewise, the Cylon plot doesn't appear to make much sense, nor does some unseen Cylon infiltrator placing a key clue on the bridge of the Galactica to be found make much sense either.(I'm also not a fan of alien humans wearing neckties and a Caprica that looks an awful lot like contemporary America/Canada, but I get they had to save money somewhere in the production process.)But the good outweighs the bad, and the whole affair is carried off with such style that it would be a huge shame for any space opera fan to not give it a try, just to see if a BSG without robot dogs is for them.Strongly recommended to fans of the original and to those looking for a more gritty alternative to the relentlessly utopian Star Trek franchise.",N/A

976723,"'Sorstalansag' (FATELESS) is an inordinately powerful, quiet journey through a year in Nazi Concentration Camps at Auschwitz, Buchenwald, and Zeitz.  Adapted by Imre Kertesz from his first novel, the story is semi-autobiographical as Kertesz spent a year of his youth in Auschwitz as a Hungarian Jew.  Though Kertesz alters his novel of the life of one Gyorgy Koves, in a manner he carefully explains in one of the featurettes accompanying this DVD, the observational skills and tenor of his literate mind suffuse this surprisingly quiet depiction of life in a death camp.We first meet Gyorgy Koves as a curly headed handsome 14-year old youth in 1944 bidding farewell to his beloved father as he departs for a labor camp.  Wearing the yellow star of David proudly, Gyorgy has little understanding of what it is to be a Jew, a lesson he will learn in the coming year and affect his perception of the world and his place in it.  Gyorgy's mother left his father and his father has remarried and requests that Gyorgy stay with his stepmother while he is away 'for a while' in the labor camp.  Gyorgy is conflicted as he loves his mother but he does as his father requests.  Almost inadvertently Gyorgy and his friends are taken off a bus and separated by the Nazis into trains bound for concentration camps.  Gyorgy remains relatively naive about what is happening: his head is shaved, his worldly goods are absconded, and he begins the hellish life of survival in Auschwitz.  Where Kertesz writes differently than other authors who have described Holocaust conditions is in his mindset of Gyorgy: Gyorgy strives to retain a sense of equilibrium in this bizarre new life, seeing certain events as probable errors, mistakes, or simply 'the way things are'. He endures starvation, brutal work, pain from an injured and infected knee, boredom, and observing sights of torture of his fellow prisoners.  Though he is walking in a stunned world, he is still able to fine the little moments of 'happiness' because of his youthful outlook and creative mind.  He gradually grows to understand what being a Jew means, and while he is unable to fathom all he sees in captivity, he learns that if he can't understand life in a concentration camp, how can he understand life outside either.  Gyorgy is literally on the carts moving toward the crematorium when the Allies free the camp.  He meets an American (Daniel Craig) who suggests he not return to Budapest, but go to America instead where he can pursue a new existence.  Yet Gyorgy's devotion to family, to country, and to being a Jew returns him to Budapest where he finds a destroyed city that had been home and wanders the town square trying to make sense of it all.As Gyorgy Koves, Marcell Nagy gives a stunning performance, a picture of a child/man who is forced to enter the world of adulthood via the horrors of Auschwitz.  Nagy captures the essence of the character with minimal dialogue and maximum use of his body language and eyes.  The supporting cast is superb, each creating vignettes in the few moments we see them that burn into our memory. The cinematography by Gyula Pados uses subdued color for the scenes outside the camps and a subtle sepia toned black and white or the scenes within the walls of the terrifyingly real buildings and yards of the camps.  The musical score by Ennio Morricone sustains the mood throughout.  But it is the director Lajos Koltai whose impeccable sensitivity to Kertesz' writing and vision that makes this long (140 minutes) film a seamless pondering of the passage of time - minute by minute, hour by hour, day by day, etc - that is the essence of Gyorgy's survival of a nightmare 'with little moments of happiness wherever they may happen'.  This is a magnificent film, by a gifted crew, and though it contains visuals that will crush your heart, it must be seen to be believed. In Hungarian and German and English with subtitles.  Highly Recommended.  Grady Harp, June 06",Fateless

The raw trerror and power that Kong exudes. The jaw dropping dangers of the prehistroric Island. Jack Black's ambitious, manipulative movie producer is perfect.Alas, there are weaknesses as well. (Spoiler alerts): Kong battles large T-Rex style dinosaurs, as he holds Ann in alternative hand and foot grabs. C'mon... the woman would be inadvertently crushed during such a combat! How much more believable would it had been, to have Kong tuck Ann in some safe hiding place.The woman has the luck of Indiana Jones, escaping death about a thousand times.The movie has far too many ""tortured close- ups"" of Naomi Watts and crew.Many of the tender scenes involving Ann and Kong are masterful. But PLEASE, PLEASE... why the scene of Kong repeatedly sliding around on ice, in Central Park? He's being playful, Ann is laughing for some odd reason... has she forgotten that her large hairy friend is in mortal danger? (As are any hapless humans who get in Kong's way!) I could had accepted the scene, if Ann maintained her concern for Kong and prompted him to keep moving.The climax at the Empire State Building is very well done, but too tortured. It ran about five minutes longer than it should of, with far too many ""cry with Ann"" scenes.  Too much of a good thing isn't necessarily good.

888091,"I was impressed with David Gordon Green's minimalist, haunting ""George Washington.""  I was surprised and delighted with his ""All The Pretty Girls.""  So I was interested to see what his third picture, ""Undertow,"" would bring to his oeuvre.  But I have to admit, I was nervous as well.  Here, he was working with a larger budget and more mainstream actors like Jamie Bell, Dermot Mulroney and Josh Lucas.  What I got was a nice surprise--a nasty little family gothic thriller.It's a bleak and uneventful existance on the Munn farm.  John, a widower played by Mulroney, is raising his two boys in a very secluded lifestyle.  Oldest son Chris, a prematurely weathered Jamie Bell, handles most of the responsibilities and chores but longs for a different life.  He rebels at every opportunity which gets him into trouble with the law as often as not.  Younger brother Tim is a sickly and emotionally stunted child.  There is talk of a family treasure--told in dreamlike fashion--but no signs of material wealth of any kind.One day, shady Uncle Deel arrives.  Oozing dangerous charm, this ex-con wants to reconnect with his brother, get to know his nephews and get a fresh start.  Chris is initially drawn to the stranger, but mistrusts him on many levels too.  And as we find out--for good reason.  Secrets come out and violence erupts.  The boys go on the run--taking hope and charity where they can get it and evading danger.  There is a certain menacing ""Night of the Hunter"" quality to their travels through the country landscape.I really enjoyed the film--it's unorthodox and has a lazy, southern gothic appeal.  I didn't know exactly where the story was going and so was caught up in the journey.  There were interesting family dynamics as well as a decent thriller.  Mulroney is perhaps one of our most underrated actors--he's great here.  He's a tremendous character actor ""cursed"" with leading man looks--and I always prefer him in these interesting choices instead of seeing him in traditional fare with someone like Debra Messing.  Josh Lucas, as Deel, is really creepy.  He was born to play villainous roles--that charm and smarminess work to perfection.  And Bell continuees to impress.So, if you want to try something off the beaten path--take a look at ""Undertow.""  KGHarris, 10/06.",Undertow

And this may be Jim Carrey's best role: it's more serious, but it also allows him just enough room to ""be Jim.""  By the end, you will really ask yourself three questions: 1) Given the chance, would you consider erasing someone from your memory?  2) Really?  Remember: they're entirely gone.  and 3) If you could go back in time, back to that moment where you first met this person, knowing in advance how the relationship would turn out, would you make the same choice you made the first time?Enjoy!",Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind

915005,"House M.D. is one heck of a medical drama. It has immensely baffling medical mysteries that need to be solved, it has 3-dimensional characters, and it has lots of good humor. Hugh Laurie captures the complexities and frailties of Dr. Gregory House perfectly; he should have won the emmy for Best Actor last year instead of James Spader. Epps, Morrison, and Spencer steal the show with their realistic and sophisticated characters. Edelstein and Leonard play their parts well throughout the series.

476598,"Speaking as a Star Trek purist (I only like TOS), the season three episodes are an essential part of any Star Trek collection.  I'm not saying ""Spock's Brain"" won't make you laugh, but I am saying ""Turnabout Intruder"", ""Is there in truth no beauty"", and ""Let that be you last battlefield"" are examples of profound themes that put to shame any contemporary TV show.I always liked the incidental music as well as the background sets utilized well here.  The extras feature Doohan, Koenig, and Sulu who discuss among other things why NBC cancelled them.  The text commentary is just blurbs from some NBC apologists.Anyway,  my first encounter with these episodes dates to the early '70s and the first reruns.  I always like ""Turnabout Intruder"" with Dr. Janis Lester vs. Kirk.  What is it that was exchanged?  The ""soul""? consciousness? self? But it was also ""mind"", as they retain knowledge.  There is an ambiguity there, but also a profundity. ""Is there in truth no beauty"" is another great one with Diana Muldaur featuring the Ambassador that drives humans insane by mere sight (always appreciated those wierd camera angles of the insane).  The first victim's rant is great, ""no, they come in your dreams....don't love her! She'll kill you if you love her!""  And Miranda's coldness, but obsession with ""becoming one"" with the Ambassador.The Tholian Web is always a good one as a ""ghost"" Kirk keeps showing up, and Chekov goes insane.  ""Spectre"" is the Western episode as the Clantons (Star Trek crew) take on Wyatt Earp's gang of thugs, and Spock uses his mind meld to save them.I always thought ""Let that be your last battlefield"" was great as two survivors of a planet at war fight each other via the Enterprise.  Also ""Eden"" is an interesting look at space hippies, even if Dr. Severin IS insane (however what he seeks is not) and ""Yay Brother"" isn't that good a song.  There are many other good episodes here and if there is supposed to be a third season drop in quality I don't see it. NBC was positively idiotic for cancelling the show.Star Trek TOS now stands as a monument to the spirit of the '60s and what might have been, had the counter-'60s forces not triumphed.  But as Kirk says in ""That which survives"", ""Beauty....survives"".  All these episodes are worth seeing if only to show that once there was actually such a thing as creativity on TV.","Star Trek - The Original Series, Vol. 9, Episodes 17 & 18: Shore Leave/ The Squire of Gothos"
218669,"This is a mystery that is much better than the current ones or the plethora of remakes coming out of Hollywood.  While there are some formula elements to it, such as Hitchcock's obligatory blond, this movie feels fresh and fun after a full 50 years.  That is really something!I think that its succcess hinges on the acting, which is good all round, but also on the way that the audience is kept guessing.  Is Grant reverting ot his old self?  Is Grace Kelly doing it for kicks?  Etc.  What is so fun about it is that it never crosses the line of the utterly outlandish, with superhuman feats or a deus ex machina ending while maintaining the element of surprise and mystery.  You just have man struggling - or posing to be - in search of solving a crime so that he won't get nailed.  Then there is the setting, in 50s Monaco, which adds a twist of glamor.Warmly recommended.

Since I had never even heard of the movie, I was pleasantly surprised.

If not for one specific scene... I would have given this movie one star.So, anyway, it's a movie about this guy who falls in love with this girl, because she's really really beautiful and self confident, but then he finds out that she's married to this really big fat guy too... who's way way older than her, and way richer than he is. So then he's all broken-hearted.... so then he sort of goes through this flower period, where he realizes that he was wrong and that he needs to sort of... re-birth.And he does... and he becomes this really amazing sensative guy, and travels all over the globe in search of the meaning of world peace. Then, while he's feeding starving children in Africa, he meets the girl in some swanky hotel where he's giving one of his peacful speeches. And she sees the man who he's turned into... so different from the skinny little boy next door who threw snow balls at her on the way to school.At least, that's is what I feel has happened INSIDE of him. Because when he sees her again he feels like a different person since the last time he met her.

1012349,"ok someone needs to bring brian singer back and that is all there is to it.  i can wholly blame brett ratner for this movie because i think that marvel is also largely to blame.  the plot is very un-xmen like.  the premise is believable but i dont think that it was an appropriate way to ""end"" the franchise.  the fight scene or last stand of the movie is the best part.  one thing i loved about this movie is the use of powers on display by all the mutants involved.  beast's acrobatics were cool, wolverine was same as usual, i liked that storm flew and actulally fried someone.  kitty displayed some nice moves, and iceman finally ices up.  pyro really shows his evil side and callisto was pretty cool.  the multiple man makes a great appearance in the movie also, i got a kick out of him.  JUGGERNAUT IS NOT A MUTANT!!!!  this is almost to the point of unacceptability.  althought i think that he had the best line in the movie.  colussus looked cool but very underdeveloped.  why did rogue have to take the cure, she has tried this in the past (comicwise anyway) and she has always gone in the opposite direction.  frustrating to say the least.  now the effects in the movie were pretty good.  the bridge scene is awesome.  what happened to cyclops?  where is he?  is he disintegrated?  i think that a fight with sentinels would have been a better movie.  just my opinion.  is this really the last team movie?  i hope not.  i did feel sorry for mystique in this one, just goes to show you how evil magneto is.  but it may look like the effects are only temporary.  so who knows what is going to happen.  also dont kill everyone in the movie, it may make for drama but that does not mean that the drama is good for the movie.  this is my rant and i am sticking to it.  i am frustrated because i am a loyal fan of the xmen and have thought that the last two xmen movies rank at the top of all time comic movies.  this one does not.  they messed with the system and they are messing with the core audience of the book.  i am aware that this is a movie and not the book, but those who make the movies should always remember that those who read the books are going to be the majority that see the movie.  i am an xmen purist and proud of it, i would just like to see respect given to the history of the book and what it stands for.  by the way stay till the end of the credits, apparently there is a scene at the end.",N/A

927559,"**CONTAINS SPOILERS**In the vein of LOVE ACTUALLY, 11:14 gives us a set of intersecting storylines but in a very black comedy way. And while I enjoyed LOVE ACTUALLY very much, 11:14 I enjoyed only marginally. Don't get me wrong, it is entertaining. But a few times during the viewing I said, ""No way would it happen like that.""11:14 focuses on several lives that are forever changed at exactly the same moment, and how each overlaps the other in strange and often chuckling ways. The film starts out with Jack (Henry Thomas, E.T.) driving down the road, half-drunk, when he runs over someone in his car. Terrified that he'll go to jail, he quickly tucks the body into the back of his car's trunk. Norma (Barbara Hershey) approaches the accident in her own car, sees Jack, and quickly surmises that he's hit a deer (""Happens all the time right around here""). She helpfully calls the police to notify them of the accident and drives away. Officer Hannagan (Clark Gregg) shows up on the scene and uncovers the truth. Or is it the truth? Did Jack really hit and kill this guy?We back-pedal to another group of lives, a trio of young boys out for a good time. They're driving around, drinking, and letting ...um ...everything hang-out. In fact, one of them decides to pee out the window and it is during this time that the driver accidentally runs into a young woman in the middle of the road, instantly killing her. How terrible. Or is it? In the process of slamming on the brakes, the young man who was peeing out the window loses his manhood, too. Ouch!Another set involves Buzzy (Hilary Swank) and Duffy (Shawn Hatosy) who are workmates at a local convenience store. Duffy needs cash and decides to rob the store (with Buzzy's approval). Trouble is, Buzzy wants him to wound her so that it looks like she was trying to protect the store and won't get fired. A gunshot overheard. A bowling ball. A missing set of keys. All of these things lead to some rather outlandish yet darkly funny hijinks.The final set of lives (mostly) are the family of the aforementioned Norma (Hershey). She's married to Frank (Patrick Swayze) and they have a daughter named Cheri (Rachael Leigh Cook) whom starts all of this pandemonium. It is her who is on the phone with Jack (Thomas) at the beginning of the film and it is this that causes Jack to get into the ""accident"". It is also Cheri who is responsible for the death of a young man by having sex with him in a cemetery and causing a headstone to fall on his head, thus crushing his brains out. She's not a very nice lady, out for ""the money"", and she's using everyone, including her father, in order to get what she wants. She is the one who's responsible for the dead guy that Jack hits; he didn't run-over and kill anyone. It was Cheri's father throwing the body of the bashed-in-brains guy off an overpass and landing on Jack's car. She's also the young woman who gets hit and killed by the trio of boys out having a good time. And she's been pretending to be pregnant and needing money from her boyfriends in order to get an abortion. One of these boyfriends, as it turns out, is Duffy, who would use the money from his robbery in order to pay for Cheri's procedure. But her death puts a quick end to that and closes pandora's box.Twisting the viewer's perceptions is the game here, and it's pulled off pretty well. The story was entertaining and I kept watching, only to be amazed at how these lives intersected.The only downside is the impossibility of certain aspects. Most notably is the cop, Officer Hannagan, who is the only law enforcement official we ever see. Considering all of the death, shooting, accidents, and other bizarre occurrences, the police would've been swarming over these scenes. But no. All we see is one lone officer with no crime scenes. Not likely.Still, the story moves along a great clip and the audience is entertained by the unfolding stories.",N/A

27095,"The Night Porter (Liliana Cavani, 1974)What to say about this exquisite film? It is as difficult to review as it is, sometimes, to watch.It's Vienna, 1957. Max (Dirk Bogarde), an SS officer who's been living underground as the night porter of the Hotel de L'Oper, has a chance meeting with Lucia (Charlotte Rampling), the wife of an American conductor. The problem is, Lucia was an inmate in the concentration camp where Max served, and the two of them had an intimate, if twisted, relationship. Lucia's presence puts Max in great danger, yet he doesn't know what to do...A stunning examination of the enduring quality of power, both sexual and authoritarian, The Night Porter rarely puts a foot wrong on the tragicomic path to its inevitable ending. The acting, the sets, the subtexts, the lighting, everything works in tandem here. (If there is a criticism to be levelled at the movie, it is the pace, which stumbles momentarily a time or two before righting itself and continuing on; given the mental image that's likely to raise given the film's subject matter, even that might have been intentional.) Bogarde and Rampling are both playing characters who are in a situation that is at best absurd, and yet both play them to the hilt, not once allowing the viewer to think that this situation couldn't really be happening. And the true magic of the movie reveals itself in that remaining the case, even as the situation gets more and more absurd.A brilliant, brilliant film. **** ",N/A

However, friends didn't have this as an immediate reaction, but agreed after I mentioned it.The underlying story: (1) Guy Fawkes is an unlikely hero.  The Gunpowder Plot was to replace a religiously tolerant government (for its time) - the laws on religious conformity were largely unenforced (a version of ""Don't ask; don't tell"") - with a Catholic state that included the Inquistion.  Guy Fawkes had more in common with the autocratic government of this story than with the resistance.  (2) The victory against the dictator had been won before the Parliament building was destroyed, and that victory came from the leader being parodied and mocked on TV.  V's destruction of the Parliament building was an act of anarchism - destruction of institutions simply because they are institutions.  Realistically, you don't destroy institutions with long solid records because they have been briefly subverted.  OK, so I think more about these things than the average movie goer!",N/A

639650,"Based on the best-selling novel that took the world by storm, the film version of The Da Vinci Code, directed by Ron Howard, has been eagerly anticipated by fans ever since the book hit the shelves in 2003. When Robert Langdon (Tom Hanks), a world renowned symbologist, is brought in to help investigate a bizzare murder he meets cryptographer Sophie Neveu (Audrey Tautou). When she tells him that he has become a suspect in the murder, they quickly gather up the clues from the crime scene and try to escape. This results in the two being chased first by the police and then by assassins in the employ of Opus Dei as they continue to uncover a conspiracy that the Vatican wishes to remain a mystery. The film moves at a brisk pace, with twists and turns abound along with plenty of revelations for conspiracy theorists to revel in. However, the movie seems to drag on due to Howard's urge to cram every bit of information possible into the massive 149 minute runtime. It also doesn't help that the surprises, though fun, are fairly predictable. This wouldn't be so bad if it weren't for the fact that the characters, no matter how much backstory they are given, seem like nothing more than vehicles to push the plot forward; even Paul Bettany's albino monk assassin, Silas, a character with obvious cinematic potential, feels sterile. These weaknesses can result in some scenes feeling a little flat where any one of those missing elements could have bolstered such moments admirably. The film isn't all bad but the negatives, unfortunately, weigh in almost even with the postives. Had Akiva Goldsman been able to infuse the characters with some humanity and a few scenes been left on the cutting room floor, The Da Vinci Code would have been the lean and exciting thriller that fans had been expecting.",N/A

301097,"I liked this movie a great deal.  It was a very entertaining movie, with a story more than decent enough for a swashbuckler movie, great production values, and plenty of action.  Of course, it's not without its flaws.  Costner is simply badly miscast.  I say that not because of his American accent, which is really a very minor blemish on the film, but because he plays basically the same character in every film -- a quiet, contemplative, angst-ridden nice guy.  This is really not the ideal characterization for a swashbuckling hero (though it would have been appropriate for a character study movie such as Sean Connery's ""Robin and Marian"" -- however that role was filled to perfection by Connery).  Costner never would have gotten the part had he not been riding high from the success of ""Dances with Wolves"" at the time, and thus been able to write his own ticket.  This is yet another film in movie history where a part was badly miscast because the producers wanted to get the hottest current name on the theater marquees.  I'll also never understand all the acclaim Alan Rickman got for his portrayal of the Sheriff of Nottingham.  Rickman was brilliant in ""Die Hard"", but his portrayal of the Sheriff is so outrageous that it descends into the realm of caricature.  It makes the Sheriff amusing, which he should never be.  Also marring the film are some historical howlers.  The ""Celts"" that the Sheriff hires to attack Robin and his outlaws are presumably referred to by that name in order to try to make them generic, and thus avoid offending the Irish, Scots, and Welsh by characterizing them explicitly as barking savages.  But not only would any of these Celtic peoples have been referred to as Irish, Scots or Welsh by the English at this time, they would have looked and acted nothing like the stereotypical, fur-clad barbarians seen here.  But the movie was still good, and plenty of fun.I also feel I must correct a point another reviewer raised about King John.  Not only does the movie not suffer for lack of him as a villain (John was hardly the only brutal, villainous man in England, so other noblemen can fill that role more than adequately), but John, while far from a good king, has gotten a worse rap than he really deserves in some respects -- especially in comparison to his older brother Richard the Lionhearted.  In fact Richard was at least as bad as John was for squeezing the people for tax money.  He bled England white in order to pay for his military adventures in the Holy Land and in France, and spent only six months of a ten year reign in England.  John, though undeniably treacherous, vengeful, and suspicious to the point of near paranoia, at least stayed in England and tried to govern it.  His efforts, while not all that successful, were not entirely incompetent either.  Where Richard cared not a whit for England except for how much money he could wring out of it, John took a personal interest in the judicial and financial administration of the country, and he  can claim some responsibility for advances at the Exchequer, in the administration of justice, in methods of taxation and military organization, and in the grant of chartered privileges to towns.  His political judgement was actually not at all bad; it was his hot-tempered, treacherous, and vindictive character that led him to tread on the rights of his barons, and  overreach his authority on occasion, thus earning him his bad name.  And his conspicuous lack of military success throughout most of his reign (in an era when the warrior king was the ideal, and battlefield successes could trump many other faults) led his contemporaries and successors not to overlook these flaws, as they did sometimes in other, more militarily successful bad rulers.",Robin Hood - Prince of Thieves VHS
637830,"A lot of people tend to say one thing about Hollywood remakes: why? What for? When you have an original that's easily a classic, there almost seems little point to revisit. Peter Jackson said King Kong was his inspiration to be a filmmaker so maybe it's a case of the student trying to become the teacher? A way of saying ""thanks""? An update? I don't know but as it stands the film is pretty good entertainment with large amount of flaws all over the place.You all know the story but I must repeat it. Carl Denham is a filmmaker who is not delivering on his films. He decides to get out quickly on a filmmaking chance of a lifetime but he needs an actress. He finds Ann Darrow, a struggling vaudeville actress. Bringing her in, they head toward the mysterious Skull Island where more than just locals roam.Officially the film won for Best Visual Effects which personally I don't understand. There's obvious CG shots all over the place including some much needed redos on compositing. In New York at the end it's absolutely beautiful on top of the Empire State Building but on Skull Island it's almost cringe-inducing at parts. Not to mention the sounds outside of Kong are merely ok but go figure, they won Best Sound and Sound Editing. T-Rex's don't sound big enough personally.The other flaw is the action sequences. Yes they're cool and yes they're exciting but they're also incredibly silly. When you got guys running from a herd of brontosaurs and only 4 or so get trampled in such a narrow space is hard to believe. Not to mention when they topple over. Then there's Kong fighting no less than 3 V-Rexes(apparently they're not T ones they're V) with only bites doesn't add up. No big chunk missing or torn flesh, it's merely teeth marks and blood. It might sound like I'm nitpicking but when you want people to believe in such an extravagant world it helps to nail reality's details, even if it does have large spiders and a gorilla.One more nitpick: its editing and length. Much of this film could've been chopped off. Spielberg even when making the 2 1/2 hour Close Encounters or 3+ hour Schindler's List, never made a boring film(some exceptions may apply). Jackson on the other hand might need to fire his editor since so much is rather unneccessary. It's as if the only way to make the film epic is to pack it with as much as you can. Subplots and sidestories(such as a cabin boy and a father-like figure) are never resolved.Where the film works is the acting, despite its odd casting choices. Jack Black makes a good Denham but not an excellent one and Adrien Brody doesn't scream action hero to me. The supporting cast is good though with the under-utilized Colin Hanks(bit of a slip when I mentioned Tom instead). Naomi Watts is the perfect Ann Darrow though, tough and very emotional. In fact, it's probably rare to not find her teary eyed in the film, and quite a set of lungs. Her screams people although the other thing...It's one of the most biggest and expensive movies ever yet I feel it's not an A picture but it's not a so bad it's good B picture. It's like a B+, entertaining but so much problems it has.",King Kong

944027,"After being kicked out of Harvard for taking the blame for his roommate's cocaine habit, Matt Buckner (Elijah Wood) travels to jolly old England to visit his sister Shannon (Claire Forlani) and her husband Steve Dunham (Marc Warren).  He soon finds out that England isn't so jolly, and, as Steve's brother Pete (Charlie Hunnam) tells Matt, there's only two things the English hate more than Yanks: police and journo's (journalists).  Matt disguises the fact that he studied journalism at Harvard, but cannot hide the fact that Pete knows that Matt's father is one of the most revered journalists in the world.  After hanging out with Pete for one night, Matt becomes involved with the football ""firm"" GSE, or Green Street Elite, an extremely strong firm headed by Pete.  They back the team West Ham United, and their rivals are the Millwall firm, headed by an insane Major named Tommy Hatcher (Geoff Bell), who lost his mind after watching his twelve year old son get trampled ten years ago by the GSE.  Within a short time, Matt severely changes from being the weak Harvard boy to a hard edged, tattooed hooligan, willing to risk everything to fit in with the GSE.  Everyone takes a liking to the Yank, except Bovver (Leo Gregory), who never really trusts Matt.  Bovver is Pete's right hand man, and a bit of jealousy ensues when Matt begins to integrate into the group.  Matt proves himself in battle time and time again, but never gains the trust of Bovver.  The gang, with the help of Bovver, slowly begins to discover who Matt really is, and the climax is filled with so much emotion and conflict, and the writers bring Steve back into the picture just in time to have an explosive conclusion.The casting of Green Street Hooligans is top notch.  After reading Roger Ebert's review of the film, I began to ask similar questions about the necessity of Matt, and the casting of Elijah Wood, but I think Ebert makes a good point: ""At first I thought the character of Matt was unnecessary. Why not simply dramatize the world of firms? Do we need a Hollywood star as an entry point for non-British audiences? If you must have one, Elijah Wood seems so very unlikely as a street fighter that I began a list of more plausible actors for the role. Then I realized the movie's point is that someone like this nerdy Harvard boy might be transformed in a fairly short time into a bloodthirsty gang fighter. The message is that violence is hard-wired into men, if only the connection is made. As someone who has never thrown a punch in my life, I find that alien to my own feelings, but I remember years ago, late on nights of drinking, when anger would come from somewhere and fill me. Certainly alcoholism is essential for firm membership: It is inconceivable that anyone would go into action sober.""  At first glance, Matt does indeed seem an unecessary character, but after thought, this decision does benefit the film in an extremely positive way.  Anyone can be attracted to gangs like these, much the same in America with street gangs.  They create a sense of belonging.  This film is very insightful, although I cannot say much for the accuracy of the portrayal of the firms, as I do not live in England.  What I know is that this is a powerfully explosive, violent, and bloody film that never stops being entertaining.  It's fast-paced, hard-edged entertainment that never lets up.",N/A

Despite this being a drama versus a comedy, I didn't see an imprint of Woody's style in this film in any way shape or form.  Was it really directed by Woody Allen?  I had to check the DVD cover to be sure.I did like the idea of the ""matchpoint"", explained via narration in the begining of the film and the scene of the tennis ball striking the top of the net with the potential to fall on either side.  Woody Allen explored the concept of how fortune and luck played a bigger role in people's lives more than they claimed it did.  In the case of the main character Chris, fortune very quickly was falling out of favor with him.  Was he man enough to withstand the consequences or would he force fate his way?Worth a watch but disappointinlgy mainstream.",Match Point

738055,"Night Passage was the movie that ended the partnership of actor James Stewart and director Anthony Mann. Their classic Westerns, such as Winchester '73, The Man From Laramie, and of course, The Naked Spur, were all classic Westerns with gritty,edgy performances by Stewart.But Stewart and Mann parted ways on this script involving a disgraced railroad detective who tries to redeem himself by capturing a group of train robbers. Maybe it was the fact that Stewart would sing and play the accordion in the film. Maybe it was the fact that Dan Duryea's character was suspiciously like his role in Winchester '73.At any rate, this film is still a treat and an delight. Stewart plays a character very much like his Mann films, and Audie Murphy gives one of his better performances as the Utica Kid, one of Duryea's gang member, and someone who shares a secret with Stewart. And Duryea plays his part with gusto.Western fans of the Mann/Stewart films should enjoy this film, regardless of the similarities, or even the differences between those films and Night Passage.",N/A

998153,"Learning to like yourself is one of the toughest things to do. Becoming good, or great, at your natural talents should be an ultimate goal. Such is the life lesson of AKEELAH AND THE BEE.When 11-year-old Akeelah Anderson (Keke Palmer) turns in her homework for English class, she always receives a high grade, even though she rarely studies (or so she says). Prior to his shooting death, her father had instilled in her a love of language by challenging her at Scrabble. She often speaks to his picture that sits propped on her desk, a reminder of pleasant times. But pleasant times haven't been around the Anderson household for some time. Mother Tanya (Angela Bassett) works full time while trying to support her children, one of which is being sucked into the world of drug dealers. Akeelah is being harassed at school by those who notice her differences. They call her ""freak"" and demand she do their English homework. So when principal Welch (Curtis Armstrong) pressures Akeelah into the school's spelling bee contest, our young heroine is less than willing. She doesn't want others to call her names, too, or gain any sort of confirmation that she's ""different"". But Akeelah has talent. Her mind is a sponge. She just needs the right motivation to set her on the path of self discovery.Enter Dr. Larabee (Laurence Fishburn), a retired UCLA professor. He's also experienced loss not long ago. His young daughter died and his wife left him. So when Akeelah shows up, he's less than accepting of her. But the two form a teacher/student relationship and quickly learn much about each other ...above and beyond spelling words.Dr. Larabee helps launch Akeelah toward the Scripps National Spelling Bee in Washington DC (aired on ESPN), and it is here that we see Akeelah's talents take wing. Battling over 100 other contestants, Akeelah has deeper motivations at the tournament than just winning.Although smaltzy and predictable, Akeelah and the Bee has a great message: not denying who you are. The typical hero's journey infuses the script, something we've seen millions of times (from ROCKY to HARRY POTTER). But the shining light for the film is young Keke herself. Her emotional range is astonishing for such a young actress, playing right up to the level of co-stars Bassett and Fishburn.Without a doubt, the documentary SPELLBOUND aided in this movie's success. And although Spellbound had a lot more realism in it, Akeelah and the Bee matches it well from a fictionalized perspective.This film's a winner even with its predictability and common plot.",N/A

The invasion scenario while absurd was popular in intelligence and military circles at the time. The acting is slightly better than ""Summer stock"" with some notable exceptions and cameos. Powers Boothe for instants plays a fighter pliot turned Special Forces Adviser with conviction although his character is clearly a composite.Today and after the past ten years I revisted the film again and it ""dawned"" on me this movie is oddly about the 1980's Soviet-Afghan War.

645569,"First of all, I want to say that it is completely ignorant of Pete Hammond to call this film ""Fatal Attraction for a new age.""  Sure, ""Fatal Attraction"" was a good film that asks many questions.  However, nothing, in any form, can compare to what this film does.  Secondly, for those of you giving this film a bad review, you knew, by reading the back of the box, that this would be about pedophilia, and the extreme measures of one girl trying to teach him a lesson.  You can't discredit the film for that reason.  Many reviewers, including Roger Ebert and Richard Roeper, have highly reccomended this film, but they have also added a warning that this film would be extremely uncomfortable.  And boy, is it.The beginning of this film is not too out of the ordinary of the context of the plot.  Jeff (Patrick Wilson) is a thirtysomething fashion photographer, with a thing for younger girls.  Much younger.  He talks to Hayley (Ellen Page, in an extremely Oscar-worthy role) in an online chat room, and she agrees to meet him at a local coffee shot.  After discussing various things, Jeff tells Hayley of his profession, and she agrees to go to his house and let him photograph her.  In the beginning, we feel nothing but disgust for Jeff, as we should, but later in the film, we get caught in a limbo.  More on that in a second.  Jeff and Hayley arrive at his (Jeff's) house, and Jeff offers Hayley a drink.  More disgust.  Hayley tells Jeff that she learned in school that a person shouldn't take any drink they haven't mixed themselves.  Hayley proceeds to mix drinks, and Jeff should have taken a lesson.  After more small talk, Hayley turns on the music, and starts getting rowdy on Jeff's couch.  By this time, Jeff is feeling a bit under the weather, and soon passes out.  When he wakes up, he finds himself tied to a chair.  He first dismisses it as a ""sex game"" but soon realizes that Hayley means business.  For most of the film, we feel the base feeling of contempt and disgust for Jeff.  But what follows, at least from a male perspective, draws sympathy towards Jeff.  I don't want to say that I feel bad for what happens next, but...yes, I do.  I did feel bad for Jeff.  Before you call me a pedophile, let me explain.  Nothing on the face of the Earth could have prepared me for what was about to happen.  Jeff get's knocked out again, and the next time he wakes up, it's like we've been drawn into ""Saw"" (except so much better).  He wakes up on a cold table, pants down around his ankles, and an icebag on his privates.  Hayley comes in with shaving cream and a razor.  Jeff asks what it's for.  Hayley tells Jeff that she needs to shave him if she's going to castrate him.  Are you serious?  She is, and, as if to give Jeff some relief, she tells him that she has a medical book to help her.  Whew, that would take a load off of my chest.  What follows is one of the most dramatically intense scenes that I have ever encountered in a film.  I can't even begin to describe it.  If I told you anything else, I would be giving it away, but just know this.  The climax of this film is one of the most suspensful climaxes I have ever seen.In reading Roger Ebert's review of this film, he posed a question that never even crossed my mind.  ""Still, what precisely is going on here, and is it anywhere near as clear as it seems?  Is [Hayley] perhaps getting some pleasure of her own out of the situation she has created for Jeff?  Are there two perverts in the room?""  Brilliantly said, and I think there is a sound argument behind it.  I think I'll leave that question unanswered.  I like to leave things open-ended.  The fact is, this film is brilliant.  It's suspensful, terrifying, and knows how to push taboos.  The performances are brilliant, especially Page's, and this is one of my favorite (with a warning) films of the year.  This has serious top-ten contention.",N/A
684927,"I still had to give it 5 stars cause the movie is so damn good.  But it is really sad how bad they messed this one up.  Most of the fights can be seen clearly, but I have the red sun version of this and it INSTANLY became one of my favorites ever.  So if you are like me and see this thing for 3.99 at the used store then I highly suggest picking it up, but then again if you are a movie fan at all than I urge you to get the red sun version for like 9.99.  Now since groundzero seriously puts like no effort whatsoever in their releases, we get the benefit of an uncut version.  around 97 minutes, but just like a movie like her, it could have gone on for another half an hour or even an hour would have been appreciated by me.Now the movie itself is a true classic.  I have to say that Lau kar0leung puts togethter his best directing performance ever.  Most people will put 36th chamber ahead of this which is cool, but I like a variety of things in a movie, AND MAN DID THIS ONE GIVE IT TO ME.  Now I do strongly urge you to get this movie because it is a rare gem.  David chiang stars as someone working for the government and has to go on a mission to capture a revolutianary(lau kar-wing).  When he arrives at his destination he meets a young woman who is beating up her teacher and throwing him out of her family;s house when chiang shows up.  So of course chiang becomes her teacher, because, well, her uncle is the guy that chiang is looking for.  Now the love story in this is what makes this flick EXTREMELY unique.  I would have to give the edge to this movie over another of my favorites of lau's, shaolin challenges ninja.  The action in ninja edges this out a little but you just can't beat the story in this.  Now this is kung fu and while the love story actually made me forget that I watch these movies just for the next fight, the love didn't end up where I wanted it to.  But to replace a partially great love story are a series of like 4 kung fu fights that pretty much come one right after the other, except for a small break for chiang to learn mantis style.  And I have to interrupt myself to say that I am not a chiang fan, at all!!!  But he is VERY good in this one and I certainly will look at him differently from now on.  His work with the 3-section staff is pretty cool, and the way he learns mantis goes back to the origins of kung fu.  While it is pretty far fetched, the martial arts are actually based off of watching animals movement, hence the 5 animal forms.  Also li-li-li makes a nice appearence as  david's girl's mom.  She is extremely hot like always and does some good fighting but they could have made more with her character.  But still there is a series of battles in this one that will make your jaw drop.  To give you a preview, the final fight goes like this, I will give a SPOILER warning but I am just explaining the fights, so read below if you want to know who the fights will include.Final series1.-norman chu double swords.2.-wilson tong with the spear.  BTW, I don't know wilosn very well(except snake in monkey's shadow of course), but I had to read kungfucinema.com's review to find out who this guy was who is wielding the spear.  Now I recognize him from master killer and many others, awesome MA.3.-lau with the pipe, nice showcase for good hand to hand, oh this scene is freaking sweet.  Almost better than the scenes with the girl and the one wher ehe learns mantis.One hell of a movie.",Shaolin Mantis

614046,"It's difficult to imagine that a movie inspired by an amusement park ride could be as good as this is, but it is. Much of the excellence of this film is due to some inspired performances turned in by some very gifted actors.The eccentric Johnny Depp is the sheet anchor of PIRATES OF THE CARIBBEAN as Captain Jack Sparrow, the roguish, charming, unkempt former Master of the ship ""Black Pearl."" Keira Knightley plays Elizabeth Swann, the daughter of the Royal Governor of Jamaica, and teen heartthrob Orlando Bloom plays her love interest, blacksmith-turned-pirate Will Turner. Geoffrey Rush plays mutineer-turned-pirate Captain Barbosa, who is dedicated to recovering the last of a hoard of Aztec treasure that carries a curse upon it.Unfortunately for Elizabeth Swann besides her corset, she is unknowingly wearing the last of the cursed coins as a medallion, making her the target of Barbosa and crew's depredations. Luckily, Captain Jack Sparrow has a score to settle with Barbosa, who'd left him castaway on a deserted island after stealing the ""Black Pearl"". Together with Bloom, he fights to protect Elizabeth and recover his ship. The Aztec treasure at the heart of it all is cursed; the holders of the treasure are damned to eternal unlife: Captain Barbosa and crew are naught more than living skeletons.The very young (17) Knightley is full of spunk, and Bloom's Turner is evolving from a rather stickish boy into a swashbuckling man. But it is Depp who drives this picture with his portrayal of Captain Sparrow, ""a mix of Keith Richards and Pepe LePew."" Depp's love-starved stoner pirate staggers, rolls, swaggers and dances through every scene, giving the viewer a perfectly realized characterization, probably the one that will be the most memorable of his career.PIRATES OF THE CARIBBEAN is helped immeasurably by a classical and archetypal storyline, the fact that is is the first of its genre in many years, it's whimsical sampling of old Douglas Fairbanks and Errol Flynn movies (one scene is lifted straight out of THE CRIMSON PIRATE with Burt Lancaster), and not least of all by truly incredible sets and special effects. No expense has been spared and no detail overlooked. With it's mix of high adventure, comedy, and good old fashioned romance, this movie can't miss. Whether it's two sequels can measure up still remains to be seen as of this writing.The dual-disc Special Edition DVD does suffer from overinclusiveness. In trying to fill the second DVD, Buena Vista Pictures has graced us with some surprisingly boring commentaries by Director Gore Verbinski and Johnny Depp, (it sounds as if they are falling asleep), and a host of other features of uneven quality. Far better are the usual ""Making Of"" documentaries and the commentary by Keira Knightley and Jack Davenport (who plays the Commodore, hopelessly in love with Knightley's character). Knightley and Davenport deliver their commentary with genetically English barbed wit.A fun film that will stand the test of time, PIRATES OF THE CARIBBEAN never falls off before the wind.",Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl

This film was originally a TV pilot (!), but it was rejected by ABC as ""too weird"".  That really isn't too surprising.  So David got additional funds, and made into one of his best films.  I don't want to hear any explanations of what actually occured in the film.  All I know is that it did occur, and I felt it, whatever it was.  That's good enough for me and the rest of the world.  Even Roger Ebert liked this film, even though I think it was because the majority of critics adored it, and Ebert didn't want to be in constrast to the crowd (Ebert has always been hostile to Lynch's work).

221018,"When I found THE CONFORMIST in dvd I couldn't believe my eyes. The movie in fact is not available on dvd format in Europe. The quality of the dvd is pretty good and surprised me since we are talking of a reletively old movie. Even the italian soundtrack is good, in spite of the mono. I met some minor problems with the subtitles, but let me also add that their choice is wide. The 16/9 ratio respects the original and it looks great even on a big plasma screen. The interviews of Bertolucci and Storaro (in English!) in the extra make the whole thing a must. This version of THE CONFORMIST includes a 5 minutes scene (interesting enough for its symbolism) that was deleted at the time of the opening. I fully agreed with those who consider THE CONFORMIST Bertolucci's best flm. If you like this sort of films, I may suggest LACOMBE LUCIEN by Louis Malle, MR. KLEIN by Joseph Losey, NOVECENTO by Bertolucci himself, IL GIARDINO DEI FINZI CONTINI by Vittorio De Sica (Oscar in 1971 as Best foreign picture).

I think the Saloon scene near the end, with the bounty hunters where Robert Duvall gets killed is one of the best bar room shootouts in ANY movie... and that's a bold statment to make especially with the scenes in The Shootist, Lonesome Dove, Young Guns, Bad Girls, Open Range, Silverado, and others",N/A
906341,"This excellent film depicts the life of the Palestinians under occupation. Viewers must keep in mind that this film was a joint production of more than one group, including an Israeli cultural fund.This is not to discredit the work. On the contrary, Elia Suleiman makes the most of his resources as he tells the story of occupation. Such occupation, according to Suleiman, has bred so much frustration among Palestinians that has resulted in their most-of-the--time incomprehensible behavior and redundant routine.In the movie, you will see short-fused Palestinians using foul language all the time while driving, chain smoking even inside hospitals, throwing garbage at each others house garden space and so on.The downside of the film, however, was its surreal dimension which was most of the time unexplainable. When Suleiman throws an apricot on an Israeli tank causing it to explode or when a balloon with Arafat's picture on it travels over Jerusalem all the way over the Dome of the Rock are all scenes that seem to be irrelevant.Surrealism hits a peak when, during a training session for a group of Israeli commandos, Palestine appears in the shape of Jesus and a consequent ninja battle ensues. Again, such surreal scenes were most of the time out of context for an average viewer.Yet, the movie is one of a kind on the market and all those who are interested in learning about some Palestinian daily life should consult this work.",N/A
408077,"When I saw HEAT for the first time, some ten years ago, I was stunned by the powerplay that was in the movie, not only through the multi-layer story and the beautiful images by Michael Mann, but also the powerplay of the two main characters. Brought together for the first time in one movie, Pacino and De Niro make an interesting pair of opponents to say the least. Not only is Heat an intense criminal story with a lot of blazing action, it also contains moments of inside looks into the lives of some of the characters. And, alsmost as beautiful as in his latest movie, Collateral, Mann succeeds in painting the city of L.A. in his own great style and in beautiful colors. With this background it's hard to believe maybe, that this movie contains one of the most aggressive shoot-outs in a movie ever. Especially this part of the movie will bring your sound system to the max. The scene itself is filmed, directed and cut in a totally perfect way - it's like you are there. Heat got more than a few thumbs up when it came to the theater and still keeps you nailed to your seat watching it now. This new 172 minute version (2 discs with a great lot of extra material, like cast training, 5 documentaries, revisiting filming locations after 10 year and much more) is a little better than the original version which I also own.

341978,"The title couldn't be more accurate with this one, at least that is what I am hoping after several uses anyway.  This workout is divided into 2 segments, the first being a 25 plus minute low/mixed impact aerobic segment with the option of using the step.  This segment is somewhat dancy as previous reviews have stated, but it's not too terribly difficult though it might take a few tries to master.  The last five minutes of this section include standing lower body exercises such as squats and lunges, a few different varieties of each.  Three of Jane's top instructors, Jeanne, Laurel and Mark take turns leading each of the segments here, Mark being the one who shows the step aerobic options.  All three do a nice job of instructing here and seem to be enjoying themselves.  The music is pretty good too, but dated.  I didn't mind it though.Jane leads the floorwork section which focuses on legs, buns and abs.  You will start with outer thigh lifts with some tempo and other variation, such as single and 2-2 count, then later on you will add a knee sequence which really fries!  I have been using the Firm and other instructors for a few years now and consider my legs to be in pretty good shape.  Well, this part in particular had my buns on fire! Most of the lower body work I do is standing, this proves to me that I need to add more floor work to my workout regimen.  After the outer thigh work you will proceed to inner thigh work, again you will do inner thigh lifts with some tempo variation, then Jane adds half and full T's which I had never seen before. You raise your leg and then move it to the back and front, interesting variation.  Once you are finished you repeat this entire sequence on the other side.  Oh no...Then you will move onto your hands and knees and focus on the hamstrings and buns.  Again there is some interesting and unique exercises here rather than the normal leg lifts here.  You start with rear leg extension with the leg straight out, then lift up, then a hamstring curl.  Then you will do rear leg lifts with a bent knee, adding some pulses, then later you will do a 3 count lift, hold, extend and hamstring curl.  I particularly liked this hamstring work.You finish off with some ab work, upper and lower crunches with variation, adding knee lifts, etc. along with some oblique work.  Then it's time to stretch out.  Jane does a nice job instructing this segment, she offers a lot of form pointers and helpful tips, plus shows you what not to do.  She manages to smile during this segment, and also says if you need extra challenge to add ankle weights.  Yeah right, we'll see about that.The prior reviews don't lie, this is tough lower body floorwork and one that I hope conquers my saddlebags for good.  The aerobic portion was decent, but I see myself using the floorwork more often here.  For those who are looking for this type of leg work, pick this one up while it's still available used.  It's good one.",N/A

[Also I did NOT claim they played with audio I simply stated they `dressed' up the `live' sound in the Studio.]2) We are not here to review their live performance at their actual shows... we are here to review the Product in question.

(Must be nice to have Roadrunner Records funding full-scale studio production of a Live Recording...)Also just because I'm being picky, Howard Jones has a really weak 'Live' voice.... There I said it. I'm sorry but it's true.Overall I would recommend it for fans of KsE... It is, at least entertaining... and bonus footage is decent.The best I could give it was-2.5 Stars[Kids, as much as I have respect for Adam D. there are much better bands then KsE.  For similar, but better, NWoAHM bands check out: Unearth, Lamb of God, All that Remains, Trivium or even God Forbid's Newest album. For some more unique bands that blend Metal with actual singing try: Opeth, Between the Buried and Me,or Into Eternity.]IF YOU LIKED, AGREED, OR APPRECIATED THIS PLEASE CLICK YES FOR:""Was this review helpful?""",N/A
927514,"It was great seeing episodes of ""Alfred Hitchcock Presents"" finally available on DVD.  The anthology series is unparalleled in weaving suspenseful tales with an unexpected, twist ending, later associated with ""The Twilight Zone.""  The half-hour format was perfect for adaptations of published short stories, and the casts were usually excellent.  Though Hitch did not direct all of the episodes (he was, after all, busy with his feature films), all are made with care and are well cast.  John Williams, a Hitch favorite, pops up in several episodes of the first and later seasons.  It's fun to see actors past their heyday or yet to achieve greater stardom in these shows. Unfortunately, Universal has given away too much in each episode's on-screen introduction, so skip them and go right to the shows themselves.",Alfred Hitchcock Presents: Season One
957841,"Okay, maybe for those of you who just looked at all the pretty pictures in Ultimates Vol #1 this will in fact be a direct adaptation for you.  However, for those of you who actually read the book, you're probably gonna be a little dissapointed.  Read my review and you'll see why.  All these other reveiwers obviosly haven't seen the movie, they've all just read articles about how cool it's supposed to be and have hyped themselves up so high that I think they're gonna feel like crying once they've seen the actual movie.  Just so everyone knows this movie is loosely based on Marvels ""Ultimates"" series one written by Mark Millar.  I say loosely because it only takes some of the elemants from that series like costumes. Most everything else is different, even the origins of the team itself is different from in the book.  Some of the crucial parts of the series that really gave it it's originality is completly left out, such as the domestic abuse between ""Giant Man & Wasp"".  I was under the impression this movie was an animated feature geared mainly towards adults.  In some ways I suppose maybe yes, there is maybe some subject matter still left in tact, but definately still geared for a family audiance.  this is not a direct a straight adaptation of the book like I'd heard so much about, some of the visual scenes in the book are there, but not in the same context as in the book.  The other thing about this that bummed me out was the animation.  I heard all this talk about how Lions Gate was using some special state of the art animation, and what you get here is no better than your average saturday morning cartoon stuff.  It honestly looks to me like it was done by the same guys who did the X-Men, Spider Man, Iron Man, Hulk, & Fantastic 4 in the 90's & those shows weren't pretty, this movie may be a step(a small step) above those series.  Basically if you're looking for this to be Mark Millar's Ultimates you might be disapointed, the movie is still entertaining, I guess I was just hoping the film would be a little more faithful to the books original content.  We get to thank Lions Gate yet again for getting our hopes up and letting us down for another less than spectacular straight to video release. Okay I can see if this were a live action film, certain things would have to change obviously.  Comics just don't translate to film as well as we'd all hope they would.  However with this movie being animated, not to mention the fact that this book was practically written to be translated to film, there's really absolutely no excuse for altering the story here at all.  I'd have been okay if the changes were just cutting ""Naked Giant-Man"" or ""Hulk Horny"", these issue's I can see maybe changing if need be for the censor's.  They've altered the story so much; why not just call the movie The Avengers, and leave anything Ultimate out of the picture altogether?  It just really bothers me how badly Lions Gate has intentionally raped this project.  Hopefully another more competent studio will bring us a live action ""Ultimates"" in the future, until then Lions Gate can just about garuntee I'll be skipping the other 5 animated features including ""Ultimate Avengers 2""(How awful does that look?)",N/A

983659,"... and then there's movies like this year's WHEN A STRANGER CALLS.This movie did not take the frightening yet realistic premise of the original 1970s horror classic and update it for modern tastes, a la the new HILLS HAVE EYES and this summer's OMEN remake.  Instead, they just dumbed it down, cast an ineffective lead and took away what made the original so chilling, namely the sadistic violence, which was seldom seen in the original, but used effectively when on-screen.To say this remake was unnecessary would be a gross understatement.  If you want to watch WHEN A STRANGER CALLS, buy the 1970s original starring Carol Kane.  It's scarier, better acted and more well-written than this garbage.",N/A
825502,"I don't know how anyone in this era can support a film like this. I never saw the original or its sequels, fearing the films would be loaded with gratutitous violence for no good purpose other than bloodletting. This one sure is.I realize there was really a Buford Pusser and he set out to clean up the debauchery and degradation of a small town. However, that is no justification for what goes on in this film.Our ""hero"", The Rock (AKA Darrell Johnson who admitted to using liposuction as part of his process to get a great build) comes home and is almost immediately put off by the debauchery and drug dealing going on in his community.He tries to affect this and gets beat up for it. When he recovers he commits about 20 felonies, then goes on trial, saying he did it for revenge, and if the townsfolk on the jury would acquit him he'd run for sheriff and clean up the despicable place.Guess what? They acquit him! Then he commits more felonies in the name of the sheriff -- with his ridiculous deputy helping out -- by denying an arrestee either a phone call or legal representation and tearing apart his personal property in a so-called ""search"" for drugs.This is followed by the beauty going over to his side and the bad guys attacking him with automatic weapons. They shoot a lot but miss him all the time.How can anyone suggest this is good and worthy filmmaking when the hero is more of an antihero than Dirty Harry ever was? I thought this movie was so ridiculous it made ""Death Wish 5"" look like a masterpiece.And I pity anyone that forked over $7 to see this at the theatre. Among other things, it is only 75 minutes duration, making it one of the briefest theatrical releases I know of.",Walking Tall
634978,"When I found out people hated Scooby Doo (the movie) I was shocked, and a little angry.  ""How can you hate SCOOBY DOO???"" I said to myself.  Now I see review after review where people think War of the Worlds is a mediocre film.  No.  Not at all.  Now I'm REALLY angry.I really really love War of the Worlds.  The plot is quite interesting.  It's about aliens that walk around the planet in giant machines destroying people, one by one.  I thought the movie was entirely good because it effectively scared the crap out of me.  Imagine if this really happened?  Wouldn't it be the scariest thing ever?  Yes!Everything from the sudden, unusual lightning storm in the beginning of the film, to the aliens coming out of the city street in a giant machine walking around killing people and destroying buildings, to Tom Cruise and his family hiding and sleeping in a basement, only to wake up to the loud realization that the aliens were heading straight for them in the middle of the night.The plot works because the aliens don't appear very often.  Most of the time you see the giant machines with spotlights shining down and searching for people to annihilate, but you don't really see the aliens, which makes the story a very good mystery.  Okay, so you see more of the aliens near the end, but not very often in the first half.The plot is perfectly easy to understand which gives the movie a LOT of points because usually science fiction movies make ZERO sense.  I understood what was happening the entire time perfectly fine.I thought the movie was overall much better than the reviews made it out to be, and for the most part, the reviews were extremely positive (or so I thought).  I guess War of the Worlds didn't hold up well over time for most people.  Well, it held up just fine for me.My favorite scene has to be when Tom Cruise was hiding behind a house and in the corner of his eye he saw the giant alien machine walking forward.  It was a very good, frightening scene because I have had plenty of dreams where something big and unexplainable was chasing me, and in the dreams, I would hide and pray that the thing doesn't turn in my direction because I wouldn't know what to do.  That scene told exactly what happens when I have a nightmare.I guess people don't like action, creativity, special effects, and a memorable, intriguing story in the films they watch.  Oh well.  This was an extremely good film.",N/A
1003655,"Chavo vs Rey Mysterio jr.: A lot of action but it would've been better if Vickie Guerrero didn't come out and tell them to stop fighting. They don't listen of course but still it was distracting in another wise great match. I would've liked to have seen Chavo win without her accidenty knocking Rey off the top rope. Chavo then nails the brainbuster and then the frog splash for the win.8/10Sabu vs The Big Show (ECW title): I figured Sabu would lose and then Cena and Batista would win their world title matches. That surprisingly didn't happen eventhough Sabu still lost this one. I wish he won though. Sure Big Show's ECW matches are surprisingly entertaining but Sabu deserved to win this one. They both take some bumps, especially Sabu of course. Sabu goes to put Big Show through a table with an airial move and Show catches him and choke slams him through the table for the win.7/10Randy Orton vs Hogan: Orton probably should've won this one. Plus I thought this was all about Orton wanting Brooke yet she doesn't make even one appearance during the match. So this was yet another big match for Hogan to win and then just disapear again afterwards. Orton hit the RKO and pinned Hogan but Hogan's foot was on the rope during the 3 count. So the match is restarted after the ref notices the foot on the rope. While Orton argues with the ref, Hogan gets up and Hulks up then quickle nails the big boot and Orton as to sell it  by laying down like 15 seconds or more as Hogan asks the fans if they want the leg drop.7 out of 10Mick Foley vs Ric Flair (I Quit): This one is all bleedning and pain and no wrestling. Both men beat the crap out of each other but Flair owns the last half of the match. The ref trys to stop the match after Flair hurts Foley bad but Flair won't let the match end. Melina then throws in the towel and Flair still won't let the match end. Flair then threatens to hit Melina with a barbed wire bat and then Foley Quits. Not bad but like the Rey match it would've been better if it had no woman involvement.8/10Booker vs Batista: The weaker match of the night. When Beniot comes back they should just give him the belt whether Batista is better on the mic or not. Beniot still has better matches with Booker and...better matches period! Plus Booker is better when he's not...King Booker. If only the WWE actually gave him the belt when he was actually over with the fans. Plus Batista just looked weak here. After Sharmel caused the DQ by jumping on his back he barely even could do the Batista bomb on Booker. Yet I'm sure he will still get the belt from Booker even if he isn't champ material right now. Just like Cena will still get the belt from Edge.5/10DX vs The McMahons: Umaga, Regal, Big Show, The Spirit Squard, Finlay and Kennedy attack DX with Umaga and Show hurting them the most. Kane comes out and gets rid of Umaga although I'm sure Kane will be the next to get beat with that from the butt straight to the throat thumb move that Umaga does. When the match starts Shawn gets beat up by the McMahons for awhile before HHH gets tagged in. End comes when Shane teases doing a Van Terminator on HHH, Shawn superkicked hims though. HHH hit Vince with a garbage can, Shawn used a superkick and HHH pinned Vince after a pedigree.8/10Cena vs Edge (World title): Cena had the match won a few times and the end comes when Edge hits Cena with brassknucks. Surprisingly not the end that I expected but I'm sure since Edge won he haven't seen the last of Cena vs Edge. Cena will still most likely win the belt from him. That is if HHH doesn't decide to push himself as champ as a face this time and take the belt from Edge. Still I doubt Cena will just be pushed in the back.8/10In all it was a good ppv with an almost solid card despite the Batista match being weak. It's one of the better WWE ppvs in awhile anyway.",WWE SummerSlam 2006
988281,"In my opinion, McCallum is the forerunner and inspiration for the CSI franchise on US television.  I caught most of the episodes on PBS long before CSI came on the scene and was totally caught up in it's dark, gritty, ugly portrayal of life and death in the East End of London.  John Hannah is excellent as Dr. Ian McCallum, forensic pathologist extraordinaire but a man who fights demons of his own...both in his personal life and at his job.  Hannah is surrounded by a superb supporting cast.  McCallum is a top-notch drama from the UK but be warned, it's not pretty, is R-rated and definitely NOT for the kiddies.",McCallum: The Complete Series
965479,"It must be incredibly hard to condense an epic book the size of ""Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire"" into a movie less than three hours, especially with a legion of hundreds of thousand of wild fans ready to break into violence if their favorite subplots are omitted, so we have to give the screen writers for this film credit in that department, to start off with.As the films get increasingly darker and the content gets more and more adult, they seem to get BETTER as well.  I'll start off with the bad parts so I can get right down to the good: The explanation of ""Prior Incantatem"" in the end of the movie was lacking, and as it is key to how the main conflict was resolved in the film, it should have been delved into deeper, as should have Harry's relationship with Sirius Black.  While it seems things move a bit too fast at first, upon second and third viewings, all falls into place.  There is one major problem I have with the film, though:  Michael Gambon's portrayal of Dumbledore is so far off of the mark that I can scarcely believe that the director did not send him off the set in a dunce cap.  The real Dumbledore is composed, unlike Gambon's version.Onto the good: Snape (played by Alan Rickman) is great as always, though he doesn't get much screen time.  Rupert Grint (playing Harry's best friend Ron) shines as always, and while Emma Watson (Hermione) is still finding herself as an actress, she does well.  Daniel Radcliffe (Harry) was never better than he is in this movie, and the movie-goers will be able to laugh, cry, and scream with him.  The actors who play Cedric, Fleur, McGonagall, and Hagrid are all on point, but the shining actor of the movie is Ralph Finnes, who plays the most evil dark wizard of all time, Lord Voldemort.The graveyard scene with Voldemort is frightening, and by far the best scene ever filmed for the whole franchise.  It could have gone wrong in so many ways, but it is utterly perfect, and terrifyingly real.  The way Ralph Finnes moves so smoothly, then bursts into an explosive thrust, the way he whispers threats, and then barks orders... Frightening.  Beautiful.Other scenes that are well done include:  Brendan Gleeson (as Mad Eye Moody) demonstrating the Unforgivable Curses, especially when he introduced the Imperius Curse as humorous only to slowly bring the class to the severe reality of it:  The Yule Ball is beautifully angsty, and the scenery is breath-taking, as is that of the tasks of the Triwizard Tournament.Overall, this movie is by far the strongest of the four already released, and it has a very, very high replay value.  For your own sake, go out and get the DVD as soon as you can.9/10",N/A

491641,"It isn't often that a movie is able to capture the charm and delights of being a child.  Usually the adults attempting to make such a movie are unable to find the magic that lives in the hearts and imagination of children.  The makers of ""The Snowman"" had no such trouble.This movie is about a young boy ... a day in the life of a young boy.  This likable lad builds himself a snowman, and he loves it very much.  That night, at midnight, the snowman magically comes to life, and the two of the them ... the boy and his snowman ... embark on a series of adventures together.  These adventures start small but soon escalate into some very daring (and heart-warming) escapades ... with the final adventure being the sort of thing kids the world over dream about.""The Snowman"" begins with a bit of live action and a brief narration, but after that everything is animated and there are no voices ... no speaking parts at all ... just background music.  But this background music is excellent ... very well matched to the action taking place.  And the animation is very good ... warm and comfortable to the eyes.I think the enduring charm of ""The Snowman"" comes from the purity and innocence of the little boy's thoughts and feelings ... and also from the love and caring that is shown by the snowman.  These things give the movie a fullness and a richness ... and make us take the film to our hearts.",The Snowman VHS
992080,"I spent my Saturday mornings as a kid in the 1970's growing up on classic Filmation television and the New Adventures of Flash Gordon is, without a doubt, one of the greatest animated series of all time.  This show revolutionized cartoon animation the way that Star Wars revolutionized special effects, which seems somewhat ironic because Flash Gordon was the primary influence for Star Wars and the animated Flash Gordon cartoon would debut shortly after it to ride the wave of Star Wars' phenomenal success. The animated series would also influence much of the production design of Mike Hodges' live-action 1980 film starring Sam Jones as Flash and Max Von Sydow as Ming the Merciless.  Much of the realism of the animation is attributed to its unique ""rotoscoping"" technique in which live actors are filmed and then each frame is traced and replaced with animation cells.  The result is realistic figure movements that make the animation come to life.  I always loved the animation because of this as well as the incredible spaceships whose fluid three dimensional movements and aerodynamic designs were as visually exciting to watch as any of those in Star Wars.The first 16 episodes of the first season were serialized the same way as the old 1930's Alex Raymond comic strips.  The second season suffered when NBC decided to change the format of the show by cutting them down to 12 minute chapters (2 per episode) and the addition of the Godzooky-like flying dragon Gremlin was thrown in to ""juvenilize"" the show for the kiddies.  The result is a precursor to several 80's cartoons that followed such as Filmation's own Blackstar in 1981 featuring the heroic John Blackstar and the dwarven Trobbits and in 1983 with He-Man and the Masters of the Universe with sidekick Orko the Magician.  He-Man was developed primarily as a line of toys by Mattel the company who also produced a series of action figures and toys for Filmations' Flash Gordon cartoon so the partnership between the two seemed only natural.  In fact, several of the vocal performers from He-Man and She-Ra were featured in Flash Gordon first including Alan Oppenheimer who voiced Ming the Merciless and Doctor Hans Zarkov was also the voice of Skeletor, Man-At-Arms and Cringer on Masters of the Universe.  Melendy Britt who was the voice of Princess Aura was also the voice of She-Ra, the Princess of Power and Diane Pershing who was the voice of Dale Arden was also the voice of Poison Ivy on Batman: the Animated Series and the voice of Isis on Filmation's Tarzan and the Super 7 together with Robert Ridgley who was Flash and Prince Barin as the voice of Tarzan.  Hopefully the release of this classic series will renew interest and demand in Flash Gordon and generate a new demand for the old Mattel action figures and memorabillia.I am very excited that this series is finally being released in the U.S. even though I have already purchased the European PAL set a few years ago.  The ""deluxe"" 4-disc North America release includes extensive bonus features not found on the 3-disc Region 2 release such as the 20 minute documentary ""Blasting Off With Flash Gordon!"" featuring new interviews with producers Norm Prescott and Lou Scheimer and interactive storyboard-to-clip comparison, plus commentary with the producers and writers on ""Planet of Peril,"" ""Sir Gremlin,"" and ""Gremlin's Finest Hour,"" gallery art, DVD-Rom scripts, Easter Eggs, 2 trading cards, and a bonus episode ""Escape From Mongo"" from the 1986 Defenders of the Earth cartoon.Here is a complete listing of all 32 episodes:SEASON ONEChapter One: A Planet In PerilChapter Two: The Monsters Of MongoChapter Three: Vultan, King Of The HawkmenChapter Four: To Save EarthChapter Five: The Beast Men's PreyChapter Six: Into The WaterChapter Seven: Adventure In ArboriaChapter Eight: The Frozen WorldChapter Nine: Monster Of GlacierChapter Ten: Blue MagicChapter Eleven: King Flash!Chapter Twelve: Ming's Tournament Of DeathChapter Thirteen: Castaways In TropicaChapter Fourteen: The Desert HawkChapter Fifteen: Revolt Of The Power MenChapter Sixteen: Ming's Last BattleSEASON TWOBeware Of GiftsGremlin The DragonRoyal WeddingSir GremlinDeadly DoubleThe GameWitch WomanThe WarriorThe Freedom BalloonThe SeedGremlin's Finest HourMicro MenaceThe Survival GameFlash BackThe Memory Bank Of MingSacrifice Of The Volcano MenUPDATE:  Although this is being marketed as ""The Complete Series"" it unfortunately does not contain the 1982 feature length animated movie ""Flash Gordon: The Greatest Adventure of All.""  From what I have heard and read, this was a truly epic film that begins in Warsaw, Poland which is being annihilated by Hitler's bombers. Flash's dying friend leaves him with a message for Dr. Hans Zarkov: ""Mongo"". Flash takes a plane where he meets Dale Arden. The plane is caught up a violent thunderstorm, which turns into a devastating meteor shower, crushing one of the plane's engines. Flash and Dale bail out, but a meteor brushes their chute, sending the duo plummeting to the earth. A mysterious purple beam plucks them out of the stormy night and gently settles them onto the ground. They have to race for shelter and find Zarkov in his laboratory who rushes them into his rocketship, informing them that the meteors are no accident; it is in fact a strategic attack. As they spirit away in his rocketship, they are swept towards Mongo and adventure. Much of the story that begins in the first few epsiodes of the series has been dramatically altered so this is more of an alternate storyline which seems to more closely resemble the plot from the 1980 live-action film.  Apparently BCI does not own the rights to ""Flash Gordon: The Greatest Adventure of All"" so that is why it is not included.  Hopefully, someone will release it seperately soon but it sure would have been nice to have included it in this ""Complete"" set.",N/A

1034772,"This item popped up in my recommendations yesterday, and I was excited! Although this is still about 4 months away from being released, it is highly anticipated by me.The main attractions in this collection (at least from my perspective) are ""Captain Horatio Hornblower"" and ""The Three Musketeers."" Neither of these has been available on DVD, and I have looked forward to their inevitible (eventual) release.""The Three Musketeers"" is a very fun movie. This literary classic has been made into several movies over the years, but this is my favorite. There is a humerous slant to this that only someone like Gene Kelly could add. This was actually one of those videos that I watched as a kid, and it made an impression on me. There are some good laughs and overall good entertainment!""Captain Horatio Hornblower"" is another one of those that makes you wonder what took so long to get on DVD! An all-time great that epitomizes the seafaring tale--and Gregory Peck doing a terrific job.""The Prizoner of Zenda"" is considered one of the all-time great family adventure movies by some prominent critics (at least the 1937 version). A terrific addition to this collection.As for the remaining three, I cannot give individual reviews on them because I have not seen them.

It is definitely only for zombie-movies fans, which I turned out to be not.On a positive side, there is an actual PLOT (I suspect that most zombie movies don't really have a plot).  And, the tension doesn't come from dread and gore but rather from the plot itself.

127113,"The movie Grease has appeared on DVD several times. The most current incarnation of Grease on DVD is the ""Grease Rockin' Rydell Edition."" This edition of Grease is truly for the superfan or the person who hasn't previously purchased the movie on DVD in the past.Grease is the cult classic that starred Olivia Newton John and John Travolta. Olivia Newton John starred as Sandy. Sandy was a transfer student to Rydell High working to fit in John Travolta stars as Danny. Danny and Sandy had a wonderful summer romance but when Sandy transfers to Rydell their two different worlds collide. The films soundtrack--and dance numbers are classic.So what makes this version of Grease on DVD different than the version's previously released? The DVD comes in a leather jacket type of keepsake case. This is cute and the box fits snugly inside of the jacket. What really makes this version of Grease on DVD stand out are the bonus features. The film recently celebrated it's 25th Anniversary. The DVD includes memorable scenes from the 25th Anniversary DVD party. Another neat bonus feature is the featurette ""Grease Memories"" from John and Olivia. There are a ton of bonus features including a Rydell sing-a-long, deleted scenes, a featurette named the moves behind the music and many more.I recommend Grease-Rockin' Rydell Edition for the super Greast fan.

If you are planning to purchase Grease on DVD for the first time I would strongly recommend this edition of the film on DVD.",N/A

106823,"The Lethal Weapon series has been a great item in the whole action/comedy buddy genre.  The first was instant classic from the 80's.  Easily the best.  All of its sequels were terrific, however just short of being as good.  However this fourth installment I believe may come to being as good as the first.  I would not say better, but I do not which one I would rather watch.  Their are just so many great things to take note of in this film such as the car chase scene and the ifhgitng sequences performed by Jet Li.  Brinigin in Jet ;Li was a great idea, plus compared to his other american films that followed (Romoeo Must Die, Kiss of the Dragon, The One) the movie ws deinetly one of his better films (even though he was not in the starring role).  And the comedy could not have any better with the addition of Chris Rock.  Although I do not think he's that funny in real life, his antics defiently gave me a good laugh in this movie.  Anyway, here is the plot.The movie starts of with Riggs (Mel Gibson)and Murtough (Danny Glover) facing off a pyromaniac.  While they are attempting to take him down we learn that both Rigg's girlfriend Lorna (Rene Ruso) and Murtough's daughter Rianne (Tracy Wolfe) are pregnant.The film then fowards to about nine moths later.  While fishing Murtough and Riggs (And Leo Gets played by Joe Pesci) get into a gun battle with chinese mobsters.  We learn that these guys were smuggling in chinese immigrants.  The leader of the bad guys is Wah Sing Ku (Jet Li) who needs the immigrants to produce counterfeit money.  He will then use this money in order to free the ""4 fathers"" (4 big chinese Criminals, one whom is Wah Sing Ku's brother)  Also a young a detective named Lee Buttters (Chris Rock) joins the gang and helps the investigation.  He also happens to be the father of Riannes baby but Murtough does not know that yet.In short Lethal Weapon is a great fun film.  Get it now a fun enjoyable time!",N/A

351980,"Those of you who've read other reviews already know the plot. It won't be rehashed here.I'd like to post some thoughts on this drama. Only one other reviewer has offered an alternate solution, viz., that Al is really a murderer who's giving us an unbelievable story. I quite agree with him.Al's account of both deaths aren't believable; one death, while possible, is unlikely, while the other one is flat out ridiculous. It makes more sense to me that Al's trying to convince the audience with the tale he's planning to give to the police. I'm sorry, Al, but it won't do; I'd vote to convict you.Al's account of Vera's character is very believable, though. One really has to see Ann Savage's portrayal of Vera to believe it. What an arch-*itch she is! Maybe the most evil woman to ever hit the screen. She'll make your skin crawl. The movie's worth buying just to see this performance, especially the scene in the car where she turns on him. Villany personified! It's easy to see why he ""killed"" her--if he  did. You decide.A couple of plot holes exist. Vera tries to get Al into some money-making schemes that wouldn't really work, from a legal standpoint--even in 1945. Moreover, the first death (supposedly from natural causes [but not really]) would have easily been detected through an autopsy; the victim is seen taking what is presumably heart medication, which would have been found in the glove department.One point nobody's pointed out: at the end, one isn't sure whether Al's actually being picked up by the police, or if he's just daydreaming/visualizing the scene where he's actually is. This isn't really a plot hole, though, merely an ambiguity.An interesting tidbit: even in 1945, there were inspection stations in California--""Do you have fruits, vegetables, or livestock?"" Another one--evidently, in those days, driver's licenses only contained a description, not a picture.The print I saw on TCM is in very poor condition. The dialogue is sometimes inaudible. In some of the early scenes, the picture is badly blurred. A couple of times, definite signs of nitrate decomposition are noticed.(The print has those spots in the frame that are the sign of this decomposition; it looks like moldy cheese or something.) In the scene in the car, while Vera and Al are talking, frames and dialogue are actually missing. Presumably, those frames had decomposed too much to be used. It makes the viewer realize that, sadly, tons of films are in desperate need of restoration.4 stars. I only docked one point for the poor quality of the print.See the movie; you won't regret it.",Detour VHS
997655,"Having just read an interview with Morgan Fairchild in the local gay press about her role in the newest Donald Strachey thriller Shock to the System, it's a real treat to watch the first Strachey film now just released on video and starring the talented and out gay actor Chad Allen.Based on one of the early novels by Richard Stevenson, Third Man Out is a gorgeously campy homage the forties noirish thrillers - except that there's one twist - the handsome, hunky detective is decidedly gay and lives a respectable suburban life with his boyfriend and love of his life Timmy Callahan (Sebastian Spence), they're even in the middle of renovating their home.Things get nasty when Strachey is called upon to protect John Rutka (Jack Wetherall), a local gay activist, who runs a webzine dedicated to outing important people, particularly hypocritical politicians. Someone is trying to murder Rutka and although Strachey is initially hesitant to help the man out, he is eventually convinced Rutka is telling the truth when he turns up dead.Director Ron Oliver keeps the action and suspense flowing, cleverly shuffling around characters, clues, red herrings and various plot machinations. In one instance, suspicion falls on Rutka's younger boyfriend Eddie (Woody Jefferies) as he was seen walking past just as a firebomb was thrown at Rutka's house. Strachey also mistrusts Rutka's sister (Sean Young), who is out to inherit most of her brother's property.But in typical noir style, the narrative builds as clues and missteps are piled on top of each other and Strachey eventually discovers a furtive pornographic blackmail plot. Keep in mind, Strachey always has his lovely boyfriend to come home to, and it's a refuge, away from the harsh realities he must deal with on a daily basis.Third Man Out as a slick, gritty feel, heightened by its very gay sensibility and for a television movie on a fledgling television network, the production values are outstanding.  Allan is a perfect choice to play Strachey and he totally inhabits the character's penchant for grittiness and sometimes even using violence and threats to get the necessary information. He's a good-looking and sexy, yet totally tough detective, who never shies away from the truth.Although its prime function is to entertain, Third Man Out also finds room for social comment - the politics of outing, the problems of gay men trying to live in a straight society, the hypocrisy of those in positions of power and sexual abuse by the certain members of the clergy, are all addressed.Ron Oliver and writer Mark Saltzman have made thrilling and sophisticated movie and I'm sure the series will only get better. Kudos, however, must also go to the talented Allen who imbeds this character with a definitive likability and is able to make the story really work. Mike Leonard August 06.",Third Man Out
125718,"I preface all of my DVD reviews with the following note: There are more than enough film reviews on Amazon.com and, quite frankly, it's a bit ridiculous. A person can scroll through scores/pages of reviews without reading a single sentence about the quality of the DVD. If you want to review or discuss a film, go to IMDB. If you're reviewing the DVD, speak to the qualities (or lack thereof) of the audio and video; mention your opinions of the plot, acting, etc. but please don't write an essay!Now, on to my review of the Congo DVD.VIDEO (A): If you browse the reviews here on Amazon or read independent reviews elsewhere on the Web, you'll find that the general consensus is that Congo on DVD is near-perfect. Black levels and colors are deep and rich, yet realistic. The transfer has no perceptible flaws; it's clear and smooth and exhibits no grain. It isn't quite as detailed as I'm used to (compared with other Paramount DVDs of early-1990s films, like Clear and Present Danger), but softness is certainly never a problem. I'm just really glad we got a stellar transfer, especially since the film didn't receive much love from critics or the public.AUDIO (A+): The DD 5.1 track positively shines. The music and dialogue are well-mixed, clear, and expressive. This movie has one of the best soundtracks ever, and thankfully it is taken advantage of throughout the movie/DVD. The excellent sound effects are exploited as well, placing you in the middle of the jungle and action.FILM (A+): Again, one of many irrelevant escapist films in my collection. As with Speed 2: Cruise Control, people take this film way too seriously, even though it's obvious the film does not aspire to be anything more than a harmless diversion. Hudson and Curry really bring life to this film, and the cast works well in general. Corny jokes, impossible situations, and silly lines, Congo has it all, and it's a wonderful thing. This movie actually has that certain charm seen in jungle-adventure films decades ago; The Ghost and the Darkness is the only film that has come after Congo to give the audience that romanticized ""feel"" of Africa. The opening minutes of the film blend beautiful shots/scenery with the great Goldsmith score, and the same formula is used in the ending. Kudos to the director for making the audience feel like they are part of the experience...a real audio/visual treat.",N/A

Before it's all over ( I couldn't bear to watch it all) he's wasted scores of Mexicans and Americans both.  Why exactly I'm not sure.  The story takes a back seat to all the cruel, unusual and gratuitous violence.  I don't mind violent movies but I'd at least like to have an interesting story to go with them.  I kept trying to like this show.  After reading reviews what I imagined sure had the real thing beat.  I mean c'mon, a guy who drags a coffin around through the desert to some God forsaken mud hole of a town, just to waste about 300 or 400 guys who go up against him?  Why it all matters I don't know.

944200,"Wedding Crashers is a comedy that is arguably the biggest hit of it's kind this year. I'm sure there are some better films available out there but this is the kind that gets all the media's attention. Comedy is a genre that lacks depth. Mixing Will Ferrel towards the end of the film was a clever move. Although his short appearance doesnt make you go bonkers with laughter, it was mildly amusing. Wedding Crashers has some great humor and Owne Wilson's stand out performance astonished me. For some reason, this is the best Comedy performance he has given.Do not even look for any ""real"" chemistry between Rachel McAdams(Goodness,she's beautiful) and Owen Wilson's character. The grandmother in the film plays a funny role in being honest. I thought they overdid the slot of the teenage gay artist. Vince Vaughn gives a role worth being acknowledged. It's his fast, unbrash, unabrasive yet loud side that made the crowd roar.Although there is nothing in this film that I disliked, Wedding Crashers is at best, one of the finer three star grade movies you will see. It is definitely funnier than Meet The Fockers which was rather sleep inducing. I wish directors could make more films that are more character oriented and a specific theme to it.2005 had many comedies,most of which fall flat on it's face.

1041471,"***1/2Like many a successful comic before him, Will Ferrell goes for his own ""Truman Show""-like bid at legitimacy with ""Stranger Than Fiction,"" a high concept comedy/drama, written by Zach Helm and directed by Marc Foster, about a man who discovers that he's actually a fictional character in an author's yet unfinished novel.Harold Crick is a straight-arrow, stuffed-shirt IRS agent who lives a life of highly regimented solitude completely cut off from any real social interaction with the people around him.  One day he begins hearing the voice of an unidentified woman portentously intoning the details of each of his actions as he goes about the business of living out his daily life.  As it turns out, the voice belongs to Kay Eiffel, a neurotic, reclusive novelist who is suffering from severe writer's block as she attempts to complete her latest work of literary fiction.  Blissfully unaware that the character she has created has actually taken form as a flesh-and-blood human being, Eiffel plots ways to kill him off in the final scene.  When Harold finally figures out what is happening to him, he seeks advice from a local English professor (Dustin Hoffman) who comes to believe Harold's bizarre predicament and tries to help him avoid his preordained fate before it's too late.Highly reminiscent of such reality-bending movies as ""Groundhog Day,"" ""Being John Malkovich,"" ""Adaptation"" and ""Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind"" among others, ""Stranger Than Fiction"" earns points for pushing the envelope in terms of storytelling, but its themes - of a man finding meaning in his humdrum existence and of an author realizing that preserving real life is more important than preserving art - are so retrograde and shopworn at this late date that the movie comes across as far less cutting-edge and innovative than its post-modernist premise would lead one to expect.  There are some very sharp and amusing moments in the film, but often we feel as if the movie's creators found themselves at a loss as to what to do with the clever idea once they came up with it.  In short, ""Stranger Than Fiction"" feels more like an outline for a movie than a fully worked-out film in its own right.Nevertheless, ""Stranger Than Fiction"" is worth seeing for the low-keyed performance by Farrell who never steps out of character as the socially backward but essentially warmhearted schnook Eiffel has invented for her printed page.  The resplendent Maggie Gyllenhaal plays the tax-cheating ultra-liberal storeowner whom Harold is sent to audit and who opens his eyes to the possibility of true love for the first time in his ""life.""  Their scenes together are genuinely well-played, touching and romantic.  With her stiff-upper-lip British accent and crisp enunciation, Thompson is perfect as the frazzled narrator and author desperate to break through her writer's block and bring closure to her literary creation.  Queen Latifah effectively underplays the role of the rational assistant sent to help Eiffel find a way to kill off her character, while Hoffman, in a wonderfully playful mood, gets to deliver most of the screenplay's funniest lines.There's a great deal of poignancy in the final act as Eiffel has to decide between literally killing off her creation to preserve her work or letting her creation live even if that means spoiling a potential literary masterpiece.  It is at this moment that Eiffel learns the true burden of being God - or at least the demi-god that artists automatically become through the nature of their work. It's a shame that the movie slouches along for so much of its running time on its way to the finale.",N/A

871245,"To enjoy the Chinese-French film `Purple Butterfly,' some patience is required. To follow the story was hard for me (and I am a Japanese who knows the historical background of the film), but once you understand what is going on, you see the merits of this period romance. First, remember the following four characters.Zhang Ziyi is Ding Hui/Cynthia, a Chinese girl whose brother is a member of one underground organization protesting against the Japanese invasion. The time is set in 1928, and the place is northern China, then called Manchuria. But one tragic thing happens to her brother, and she is also drawn into the activity of the organization.Toru Nakamura, Japanese actor, plays Itami a Japanese whose father works as an interpreter in China. But young Itami must leave this country and his love Cynthia because he was drafted into the military service by the Japanese army. Three years later, Itami comes back to Shanghai as Japanese military officer, who had been trained for espionage in China. Now Itami meets Cynthia again in this city, but this time Cynthia's love seems to have a hidden agenda for she is meetig her new lover Xie Ming (Yuanzheng Feng).In addition to the main story above, there is a sub-plot. Lie Ye (`Balzac and the Little Chinese Seamstress') plays Situ, a young, ordinary Chinese man. He and Yiling (Bingbing Li) are innocent sweethearts, but when Situ is mistaken for someone else at the crowded station, a tragic thing happens.[Noir in China] The fates of the characters are closely intertwined with the film's complicated plot. This film can be called a romance, but it would be more correct to call it a noir film. The images themselves are beautiful, and the production designs are realistic, but the murky photography and the shaky camera may not be your taste. Though there are shooting scenes, and you can see Zhang Ziyi shooting a gun - far cry from the image we associate with her (oh, and let's forget `Rush Hour 2,' shall we?) - the sequences are sometimes confusing, and probably that is one of the reasons for the general complaint about the film.Whatever your reaction may be, the film proves that Zhang Ziyi is an immensely gifted actress, but I am not sure if her acting here is her best. But to me, though the time allotted to her character was not long enough, Bingbing Li as young telephone operator is more impressive. There is one brief but memorable scene, in which Bingbing Li quietly sits in a streetcar as if unaware of the riotous street outside. The contrast between the two worlds is represented in this short sequence, and in the middle of the battles and the deaths there is a woman who is clearly in love. Bingning Li literally becomes the image of love, which is too fragile in the time of war.Writer/Director Lou Ye succeeds in creating such remarkable sequences resonant with the film's serious themes, but the jumbling of the time order and the confusing relations between the characters often do harm to them. `Purple Butterfly' is for the viewers who can be patient with the slow-moving and complicated story. It will be rewarding experience only after you put the pieces in the right places.",N/A

It is so muddy, dark and their is some odd cross-stitched look that appears often.  Whoever tried to fix this up did a horrible job.  I put in Grace Under Pressure next and it is more bright than the original release on VHS...another real disappointment.  The only concert that I can somewhat tolerate, and I emphasize tolerate, is A Show Of Hands, but even that suffers.  I am afraid that in this day and age with HDTV's and modern concerts being filmed with the best equipment makes it tough on these old films.  But, keeping that in mind I feel the companies like Mercury and even Rush should realize that it is up to them to strive to make their older product somehow comparable to today's standards.  These concerts really needed some major restoration work done to them in terms of lighting and color saturation, etc.  I think the sound is ok and the tour book reprints are great.

263877,"After his successful direction of ""20,000 Leagues Under the Sea"", Richard Fleisher tried his hand with a new kind of submarine... His ""Fantastic Voyage"" ventured upon the unfamiliar seas of the human bloodstream, and carried the magic of miniaturization to its logical limits-the shrinking of four men and a woman to microbe size, making the voyage entirely rough and hazardous...The plot follows a team of three scientists: a surgeon (Arthur Kennedy); his technical assistant (Raquel Welch); the chief of the mission (Donald Pleasance), plus the skipper of the ship William Redfield and a security agent Stephen Boyd for a possible ""surgical assassination""...The interesting submarine (""The Proteus"") is miniaturized by a secret branch called CMDF (Combined Miniature Deterrent Forces) and injected into the bloodstream of a defecting Russian scientist who has suffered brain injury and a coma from an assassination attempt... The crew must navigate to the scientist's brain and destroy the point of damage with a laser blast within a 60-minute time period...Although the plot is a tedious matter of implausible sabotage, ""Fantastic Voyage"" is a film of authentic wonder: The fascinating environment of tissues and organs of the human body through which the actors move are life-sized sets exquisitely reconstructed in great detail with amazing artistry...The plot creates a constant era of suspense... The ship and its crew are continually threatened by the system's natural defenses... Leonard Rosenman's futuristic score nicely complements the bizarre on screen happenings: the strange sound of the human blood rushing through arteries; the rhythmical muscular movements of the heart where 'every beat separates the human being from eternity.'With two Oscar Awards for Best Visual Effects and Best Art Direction, 'Fatastic Voyage' is certainly the most unusual journey into the human body, the first film to portray the vast world of inner space...",N/A
695743,"The show itself is very well made, considering the time that it was made, in Japan, and the story of ""Tetsusawan Atom"" or ""Astro Boy"" is very captivating, but the dubbing for US television is absolutely pitifuly. Of course, this was the 50's and they were trying to make the lines match the plot AND lip movement exactly, which resulted in the characters speaking very fast, or very slow. And it comes of as just plain silly. Of course, it has a nice 50's feeling to it, so it's good for nostalgia. I would prefer to watch this show as it was meant to be seen... in japanese, with english subtitles. Unfortunately, only TWO episodes are availble in Japanese with english subtitles. If they can do that with 2 episodes, they could do it with all of them. That's why I can't give this set 5 stars, despite how much I love Astro Boy and Osamu Tezuka's work",N/A

423858,"The sense of something dangerous lurking in darkness is a common fear. This fright over something unseen can be apparent or not known. In the case of ""Wait Until Dark,"" the audience but not the main character knows this threat. This puzzle-raveling technique sometimes creates frissons in the audiences' spine, when a blind woman, Susy (Audrey Hepburn,) gets into an all-night battle of wits with three men looking for a drug-stuffed doll in her home. Not knowing where the doll is, and what it contains, she has to find a way to survive the night.The plot could be tepid home-invasion formalism, but instead it is mostly played as a high-concept plot piece. In this film, the bad guys (led by the Roat, played by the methodical thug, Alan Arkin) do not try to use force to get the doll from her, but use their smooth-talking wits, instead. These men pose as old friends of her husband, burglars, and later as police officers taking the report for the burglary, trying to make her break and tell where the doll is hidden. Yet, since Susy is not sure where it is, they become increasingly annoyed, and more prone to violence.The cat-and-mouse tactics that the villains impose on the impaired Hepburn character make the movie a much better than average shocker, especially in the famous way that Susy makes the odds more even in the climax-- a showdown that is one of the best cinematic conclusions in terror film history, and will make the audience root for an end to the antagonists' terror.Hepburn gives a believable performance in a flawed character role. Susy is angry about her recent blindness, while some of her small tantrums, and glimmers of hostility make her seem like a real person-- and this is what makes her character likable--believability. Yet, she is still sympathetically attached to the audiences` emotions.For instance, in a scene in which she gets in an argument with her errand girl, her character quickly apologizes, and through this sincerity in her acting that shows that only an actress of Hepburn's girl-next-door demeanor, that can encapsulate the sweetness, vulnerability, and nobleness of a woman that many girls aspire to could pull of such a role, and Hepburn does it in valor.The spotlight is also on scene-stealer, Alan Arkin, who is as menacing as he is a smooth talking, leather jacket, and sunglass wearing in daylight, devilish cat. In what has been called his best role, he gives a memorable performance for his one-dimensional character. Arkin is simply spine-tingling to watch, and you cannot take your eyes off him for a second.The acting and drama is mostly good all around, yet sometimes the film gives way to both awkward moments of over-acting (you know the ones in the old movies with cheesy music in the background,) and a sense of palatable suspense/terror is not really achieved until the climax.Because, as good as the final 15-20 minutes are, it also feels a bit of a let down in the way that the audience may feel they wanted Wait Until Dark to scare the bejesus out of you all along. Instead, audience members are treated to something that, despite how intriguing it is, is a bit too overly-talky since it does not at first generate these emotional frissons.Yet, in the end,  Wait Until Dark features classy acting, and a grand ending that is punctuated by one of the best off-screen jump scares in the history of cinema. The film is a sophisticated thinking-(wo)man's thriller.8.0 (Out of 10)",N/A
319032,"""Grand Tour-Disaster in Time"" came to me as a pleasant surprise. When I first saw it on home video I had read a really positive review and found it to be right on the money. Although the film suffers from a low budget (in fact director Twohy should revisit this with a nice large sizable budget)the characters are well drawn and Jeff Daniels gives a stellar performance. It's the end of the world for the citizens of a small town. When a group of odd travelers take up resident at his inn Ben Wilson (Jeff Daniels) gradually begins piecing together the real reason they are staying with him; a major disaster is about to happen. These spectators are tourists from the future who want to witness the event, human suffering and chaos that will result. Wilson determines that he, his daughter and the residents of the town must somehow survive this unknown tragedy. Wilson intends to change ""the past"" based on this knowledge something the visitors can't allow.Image quality is decent for this Anchor Bay release. The film was shot on a shoe string budget overcoming these obstacles with an imaginative screenplay based on C. L. Moore's classic short story ""Vintage Season"". The film takes some major departures from the original story but unlike some reviews here I felt that these departures allowed the audience to identify more readily with the main characters. Director Twohy (""Below"",""The Arrival"", ""Pitch Black"")does a great job of taking genre staples and turning the story on its head. ""Grand Tour-Diaster in Time"" is no exception to this. There aren't any extras to speak of beyond the trailer.While ""Grand Tour"" isn't a perfect film it's one of those rare films that manages to overcome its limitations due to the sheer imagination of the cast and crew. ""Grand Tour"" is definitely worth a visit for science fiction fans.",Grand Tour - Disaster in Time VHS

I expected the same from Voodoo Moon, but surprisingly it's not a total crud-fest like I had expected it to be.  Eric Mabius (Resident Evil) and Buffy and Angel's Charisma Carpenter star as siblings with tragic pasts, that soon find themselves holed up with a few other people as demonic forces threathen them.  Predictable to the extreme, Voodoo Moon is surprisingly enjoyable for what it is, with Mabius being a surprisingly decent hero, and Carpenter looking as beautiful as ever, though her comedic talents which Buffy and Angel fans know by heart, don't get to be put on display.  The action scenes are mostly decent, and the rest of the cast, including Re-Animator icon Jeffrey Combs and the Howling's Dee Wallace, are good as well.

Gary Cooper & Helen Hayes were great actors even back in 1932. They are the best part of the movie. One of Hemmingway's best novels, did not make a good transition. I'm not sure he knew Cooper personally at this time but did pick him for the role of Lt. Henry. They were close afterwards. Hemmingway didn't like the movie much. I don't remember seeing Helen Hayes very often, her being a stage actress. She is wonderful & gorgeous as Katherine & may have loved Cooper for real as lots of his leading ladies did. If she didn't, that's good acting. It is war & theirs is a really hot, sexual love affair. The war intervenes & separates them. The battle scenes & the montages of Lt. Henry's search through Italy for Catherine was a mess. Were all the scenes shot at night? That made it rather tedious. Adolphe Menjou had a meaty role as Major Rinaldi, Lt. Henry's doctor, best friend & ultimately the source of all his problems. It's on from time to time. Or find a clean copy to own.",Farewell to Arms VHS

When his shot-up corpse is found, 40 years later, Sheriff Sam Deeds (Chris Cooper) must confront his own past and the shadow of his father, the late, legendary Sheriff Buddy Deeds.  A lot of still-hot embers are dug up as the modern-day lawman rakes through the ashes of a sordid local past.  The plot twists keep coming right up until the end.Yet, the murder mystery, interesting though it is, is not the great strength of Lone Star.  Director John Sayles, a New Yorker, must have has some local Texas assistance because STAR is one of the most accurate slice-of-life films ever.  As a resident of a place with nearly the same cultural, ethnic, and linguistic tensions and taboos, I vouch for the keen dialogue, sharp eye for detail, and dead-on accurate portrayals of the people and opinions of the region.  The human drama and social issues add as much to LONE STAR as the murder mystery.By all means get this DVD and prepare to enjoy STAR multiple times!",Lone Star VHS
432024,"HAPPY V DAYGreat mature movie about love and sexual orientationKevin Smith is one of my favourite directors, but this time he has reached the greatest depth and maturity in his career. It's not who you love, but how. That's a truth many people should bear in mind when considering own or other people relationships and choices. Here we can see how sexual orientation is only a preference -as if you preffer chocolate or coffe -although with greater consequences for life, of course-, because when that person who enters your life and puts everything upside down and takes you to heaven appears, what matters if it is male, female, or hermaphrodite? And who cares about his/her past? A film for a new generation of people liberated from ancient prejudices. Sadly, Holden can't see that simple truth. If he could have, he would still be with Alyssa.Also Recommended: Clerks, Mallrats, Jay & Silent Bob Strike Again, Dogma",Chasing Amy VHS

The sound and picture quality are gorgeous; looking and sounding delish even without a fancy TV. However, at the this price point I expect a lot more featurettes, commentaries and behind the scenes footage. I don't understand why HBO charges so much, but I was lucky, I caught a special at a local retailer and got all 5 seasons for 100.00 bucks. Also if you're only seeing the show on Bravo you are missing out. I have seen two Bravo eps and I cringed at the bad dubbing and editing. It's definitely worth owning if you enjoy the show but try to catch it on the cheap; it's a series that tends to go on sale a lot and HBO did drop the price on the first three seasons to something around fifty dollars.

When all the hostages were killed there was little sympathy then for the PLO plight. After all what country wanted terrorist to come to a neutral place that was about peaceful competition and kill their athletes? However; revenge is a double-edged sword as well. The price paid to have it is often to steep. Those Israelis that set out to have revenge on the terrorist paid a high price. I am sure Spielberg did everything possible to tell most of the story about how the Munich terrorist where tracked and assasinated. You can argue politics and religion all you like about who is treated unfairly, the movie is done superbly. Spielberg is a fine director that knows what needs to be told and how to keep the story from being to complex and muddled. He doesn't go into all the minutiae as some directors have done of late. Although the movie is long I was never bored or tired. It kept my interest throughout and I found the revelations of what occurred during and after the 1972 Olympic Games attack fascinating. If you enjoyed his dramas like ""Schindler's List"" and ""Empire of the Sun"" you will probably enjoy this as well. Even people who have never seen his movies should like this account of how Israel dealt with the attack on their people at the Olympic Games.

965079,"After making short films for a studio called Educational, Buster Keaton signed on with Columbia to make short films. He would make 10 from 1939 to 1941. Most were directed by Jules White, best known for his work with the Three Stooges. Del Lord, who worked for Mack Sennet in the 1920's directed two. Clyde Bruckman, who worked with Buster in the 20's and who would also write and direct films for such stars as Laurel and Hardy and the Three Stooges. The films are no where near as good as the films Buster made in the 1920's. However, if you take this films on their own merit, they are fun and entertaing to watch. Buster, despite the sometimes weak material, always did his best. Highlights of this set are;1. Mooching through Geogria. From 1939, Buster Plays a confedrate soldier in the Civil War, and gets invoved with a plot to steal a Union battle map. The basic plot of this film would be remade by the Three Stooges in 1946 as Uncivil Warbirds. The scene where Buster is ""shot"" as a spy is almost repeated word for word.2. Pest from the West. The first short, from 1939 has Buster as a traveler in Mexico who falls for a local woman, and has to fight a duel for her. The best film here.3. Nothing but Pleasure. Here Buster and his wife take a bus to Detroit to buy a new car. They figure they can save money and have a good trip. Of course the trip is anything but pleasure. The bus trip is miserable with screaming kids and all. While staying in a motel, a drunk woman wanders into Buster,s room, and he tries to put her to bed in a bed that goes up into the wall, a very funny sequence.The rest of the films are not as good, but all have funny moments. The prints used look just fabulous, and the sound is excellent. A short documentary is included which is an overview of Buster's career with focus on the Columbia years. Also, a reproduction of a shooting script is included, which is interesting to read.Jules White once said there was so much more Columbia material above the Three Stooges, and he did'nt understand why Columbia did'nt put it out. Thanks to Sony for putting these films out, and hopefully more Columbia shorts, such as Andy Clyde, Charley Chase, and Shemp Howard will come to DVD.",N/A

The most amazing event is that Data installs an emotions chip in his positronic relays. The chips gives him a sense of humor. Data smiles, laughs and does funny things like never before. His emotions and sense of humor are very cool, although he has a hard time learning to live with them, at first.There is also a scene in the ""nexus"" - a place where nothing is real, time has no meaning, so you can go into the future, or to the past and see dead people (such as Captain Kirk).

I had reservations about watching this film for fear it would only sensationalize tragedy, but the movie produced for A & E is a thought provoking, heart breaking tale of people banding together to take back control of their destiny at a great cost. No one should even question the heroism of the passengers aboard this plane and the selflessness with which they gave their lives for their country. The stories of that tragic day are told from different passengers point of view and are beautifully portrayed by all actors involved.

I remember owning a mint VHS copy of  a concert from circa 1986 playing, of all places, Daytona Beach MTV! But there has never been an official concert and it's about time! What better  era to catch Bad Brains but in their early days of 1982. Although they had been around for a good 5 years at the time, they were still a ""new"" band. This concert footage, restored humbly and amazingly by the way, is primo early Brains at their purest and most aggresive. You can envision the birth of the New York Hardcore scene just from watching this show. HR and the band are young'ns and full of endless energy. The crowd goes crazy and this might even be the best video document of the now closed CBGB's. This dvd was released just around the closing of CBGB's. A 1982 Bad Brains at CBGB's concert is probably the BEST way to represent and pay tribute to CB's! Bad Brains are right there at the top with The Ramones, Blondie, Talking Heads, etc of important artists to get their start at CB's. One thing I must mention which is a negative, is the lack of footage of Daryl on bassie. Although CB's was defintley small and with crowd people clogging the stage, Daryl was off to the side but completely obscured for most of the show! He had to stand behind Earl drumming because of the lack of space on the famous CB's stage. Oh well, still a defintie MUST OWN for any Bad Brains and hardcore/punk fans!! I have recently seen both HR and Doc and Darryl playing on seperate occasions, and they are getting up there in age my brothers! Hard to believe this footage is almost 25 YEARS ago!! The songs  cover basically the first two Bad Brains albums, self titled and the Ric Ocasek( of The Cars ) produced ""Rock for Light."" ""Rock"" came out in early 1983 so this concert was only a few months before. It is also culled from 3 seperate performances in '82, but it shown as a concert. This document will cement the Bad Brains legend as the greates punk/hardcore band of all time, and that is not an overstatement.

That man is Jerry Bruckheimer, ""Top Gun"", ""Days of Thunder"", and ""Con Air"" are just a few of the outstanding action films Bruckheimer has produced throughout the last 20 years.  In 1995, Bruckheimer teamed up with director Michael Bay to make a film that focuses on two hip, young cops in Miami, Florida.  To bring the freshness needed for the roles of Detectives Mike Lowrey and Marcus Burnett, Bay and Bruckheimer looked to the talents of two popular young actors made famous by two very big television shows.  The actors chosen were Will Smith (TV's ""Fresh Prince of Bel-Air"") and Martin Lawrence (TV's ""Martin"").""Bad Boys"" story as stated above, focuses on two Miami Detectives Mike Lowrey (Will Smith) and Marcus Burnett (Martin Lawrence), who after confiscating one hundred million dollars worth of heroine come under fire when the drugs wind up stolen.  With the drugs missing, the two lead detectives under investigation by Internal Affairs, it appears that this particular narcotics division of the Miami Police Department will be closed down for good.  So, with no one on their side except for a young woman (Tea Leoni) who happened to witness a murder linked to the drugs, Mike and Marcus must strike out on their own to reaquire the drugs and bring down those responsible, if they succeed they can clear their names and keep their badges for another day, but if not it may just mean jail for the detectives.Many critics were skeptical about whether or not two actors famous for doing comedy on network television shows could pull of being the leads in a high-profile action movie.  Really many actors would probably have the problem with making the jump from TV to film, especially when their primary job had been comedy, with very little drama and no action, but Will Smith and Martin Lawrence succeed brilliantly.  The comedic timing between these two actors is outstanding, and both pull off the dramatic scenes very convincingly, and the action scenes are well played and laid out thanks to the adrenaline charged directing of Michael Bay and the athletic prowess of the actors.  Jerry Bruckheimer's skill for picking projects and finding the right people to make them come together seems to never fail, and ""Bad Boys"" is no exception.If you're a fan of action films and for some reason have yet to see ""Bad Boys"", do yourself a favor and watch this movie, your satisfaction is guaranteed.""Bad Boys"" is rated R for violence, language, and sexuality.",N/A
956686,"This film is based on a novel by Dino Buzzati called The Tartar Steppe (1945). And its a great novel. Much of what Dino Buzzati writes would be classified as fantasy but this novel has a pellucid realism to it that anchors it in a kind of unspecified present. The novel begs comparison with Franz Kafka's more gothic parables, Albert Camus' The Plague, and Julien Gracq's very similarly focused The Opposing Shore. The novel is existential and it examines man's capacity to cope with the meaningless of his existence but it does so in such a unique way. Never in Buzzati's novel do we feel manipulated by any heavy-handed philosophy, rather the appeal of the novel is its unobtrusively plain, though beautiful, style and structure that nonetheless capture your imagination.Valerio Zurlini is not a name you are likely to have heard before. His adaptation of Buzzati's book --The Desert of the Tartar (1976)-- was his last film and he executes the project so perfectly that I am very curious to investigate his earlier work.A quick glance at the cast list (Max Von Sydow, Philipe Noiret) will show that the film is full of top-notch actors, but the real star of this film is the desert and the fort itself that seems to have grown out of the desert.  The desert and the fort have immense mythic allure and though there is nothing fantastic about the desert or the fort the effect this location and structure have on the soldiers stationed there is profound and disturbing. The fort is like a mirage on the precipice of a vast desert but the fort and desert are real and men must live in this location for years at a stretch. Most men would find that being assigned to such a location would be a death sentence and this is what Lt. Drogo thinks when he first sets eyes upon the desert fortress that looks like a forgotten ruin. But soon the fortress (and its mysterious history), its eccentric occupants and the way they deal with the various rumours of foreign troops maneuvering in the distance, and the desert itself seduce the young Lt. into staying for longer and longer stretches until we realize that Lt. Drogo, like so many soldiers before him, will never leave. The film can be viewed as a parable about military duty, but it can also be viewed as a parable about commitments of any kind. Like any good parable there is no one penultimate reading. The movie works on the viewer like the desert and fort work on the soldiers; at times you find you are bored and you desperately want those Tartar invaders to finally make an appearance but despite the fact that next to nothing happens you cannot take your eyes away.What drama there is takes place within the fort, mostly but not exclusively (I don't want to spoil the film so I won't reveal too much). Most of the drama is between the soldiers themselves. Each soldier seems to suffer from some kind of debility; some soldiers seem to suffer from some kind of virus that the fort doctor is convinced is caused or aggravated by the damp conditions of the fort itself.  Other soldiers seem to suffer from various forms of hallucinations or visions of grandeur which seem hopelessly misplaced in the vast emptiness of the desert.It is fascinating to watch Lt. Drogo slowly age before our very eyes. When he first arrives he is an enthusiastic and ambitious young officer who wants to prove himself in battle but with the passing years he seems to become more and more resigned to his fate. Thus you can also read this film as simply a parable of man's life tenure.However you view the film its a spellbinding experience. I think the film cannot be reduced to any one reading; it seems to elude any literal meaning we might attempt to assign to it.Highly recommend both book and film.",The Desert of the Tartars

I was pleasantly surprised...it wasn't as bad as I thought it might be. The film centers on two characters, played by Anne Hathaway and Meryl Streep. MS does a fantasic job of playing the editor of a fashion magazine similar to Vogue, who is very much the dragon lady you might expect. AH does a great job of playing a young graduating journalist who falls into the fashion world as MS's assistant, and suffers accordingly, but then goes through a transformation that she doesn't really understand is going on at first, and then later is very unhappy with. I was expecting vacuous, but this film wasn't that.",N/A
972790,"I remember watching the original Return of the Living Dead in 1985. That zombie movie played on the premise that Night of the Living Dead actually happened. It was a great twist and interesting idea. The zombies in that film weren't shambling and dumb like the one's in Romero's film. Instead these zombies were pretty quick and could talk and formulate plans and traps. Also these zombies couldn't be killed by destroying the brain. It was the birth of the superzombies and it made for a fun experience. One thing it also had was a nice dose of comedy mixed in with the horror.A few years later they had a sequel to Return of the Living Dead that was a good second helping. Nothing to write home about but it was a fun gory flick. Then came a second sequel which dropped the comedy and instead tried to be Romeo and Juliet meets brain-eating zombies. Other than the usual gore and bloodsplatter this second sequel was an utter failure. It took over 10 years for someone to try making a couple more sequels, but sure enough someone found a way to do it. They even found a good enough director in Ellory Elkayem (he directed the fun, campy giant spider monster flick Eight-Legged Freaks). There was talk that this third sequel will return the ROTLD franchise back to its roots of horror mixed with comedy. I was stoked about the news. Then when it came time to see Return of the Living Dead 4: Necropolis, I found out that it was going to go direct-to-cable. This usually means bad news all around about the overall quality of the finished film, but I was still going to give it a chance.I finally saw its premiere on Sci-Fi channel in 2005 and all my low expectations weren't even reached by the what I saw on the TV. The movie starts off well enough and right from the get-go they don't hide the fact that the film is taking place in some Eastern European country. Peter Coyote the --- only actor with any sort of talent --- makes his appearance in this scene and there's not even any attempt to make his character abit mysterious of whether he's a good guy or a bad guy. Coyote's scientist role in the film screams evil mad scientist. The rest of the cast seemed like it was randomly picked from a college campus and from the streets of Romania. The dialogue was bad enough but having them read out loud by amateurs just made it all worse.The whole premise of the film outside of reintroducing newcomers to the zombifying effects of Trioxin seemed like the writers were trying to emulate Resident Evil instead of Return of the Living Dead. There's the mega-corporation which deals with everything known to man and also research and develops illegal biowarfare technology like zombies armed with hi-tech weapons. Resident Evil did this better (thats not saying much) so it goes without saying that ROTLD4: Necropolis just didn't know what it wanted to be. There wasn't any of the comedy that made the first two films in the franchise so fun to watch. It looked as if they tried to make a serious zombie movie and instead it turned out to be seriously bad.Even the zombies themselves ended up being inconsistent with the zombies from the first two films. Some seemed smart enough but most were of the Romero kind which goes against everything that is ROTLD. Their feeding habits even changed from eating nothing but brains but to eating other parts of the body.And they're not indestructible anymore. Shooting these zombies in the head will drop them like a sack of bricks.There really wasn't anything fun about this sequel. I would've given it a second star if they just made the zombies right and added a higher gore-quotient. Zombie movies are suppose to be dumb, gory fun but instead Return of the Living Dead 4: Necropolis just ends up being dumb, horrible and awful. I had alot of hope in Ellory Elkayem as an up-and-coming genre director, but cranking out this film after making such a fun one in Eight-Legged Freaks is a mystery and saddening. I wouldn't recommend this film as a rental on dvd. Just go rent the original two films in the series and leave this one alone.",Return of the Living Dead: Necropolis
950615,"""Red Eye"" is a movie that puts most of its cards on the table. At the start we see a wallet with a pair of initials on it being stolen. We also see a large metal container being smuggled into the United States. Two points determine the pathof a line and we know that these two events are connected. Actually if you assume that everything you see and hear in this 2005 thriller has something to do with what is going on. If Carl Ellsworth (who wrote the ""Halloween"" episode of ""Buffy the Vampire Slayer"") has somebody on the airplane suddenly talk about a missing pen, then that would be a CLUE, and attention must be paid. That does not mean that director Wes Craven (""Scream/2/3"") will not play with your expectations in an effort to keep things honest, but for the most part you can see how everything is set up and red herrings are pretty nonexistent. The result is more a question of anticipation than predictability and it was not until the big finish that I actually got to the point where I was saying (out loud in fact) that this could not be the ""end"" because ""X"" had not happened yet, which is pretty good for a thriller.The genesis for this film was apparently the simple idea of what happens if you get on an airplane and end up being seated next to the passenger from Hell. At this point many of you will be thinking back to ""Planes, Trains & Automobiles,"" but this film is something quite different because it takes place in a world where apparently nothing is coincidence. Lisa Reisert (Rachel McAdams, who suddenly appears to be in every other movie being made) is a hotel desk manager for a swank hotel in Miami, who is heading home from Dallas after attending her grandmother's funeral. Her flight is delayed and she has occasion to meet Jackson Rippner (Cillian Murphy) more than once before she gets on the flight and discovers they are seatmates. He wants to know if she is stalking him and what proves to be a deadly game begins in earnest.I have to admit that when I watched this DVD I had managed to forget anything I might have heard or read about ""Red Eye."" Obviously Lisa is the heroine and Jackson is the villain (after this and ""Batman Begins,"" Murphy is going to have to make an earnest effort to avoid being typecast in such roles). But since all the dots connect in this film it has to have something to do with Charles Keefe (Jack Scalia), the new head of Homeland Security who said some rather stupid things on television for someone whose position has to do with defense and not offense when it comes to terrorists. Before she gets on the plane Lisa is juggling cell phone calls from her father (Brian Cox) and her nervous assistant, Cynthia (Jayma Mays), and the film puts more of its cards in position on the table. But there is a hole card, which is revealed when Lisa has to change her blouse (talk about bait and switch).The best thing this film has going for it is Rachel McAdams. In case you did not notice, 2005 was a very good year for the actress. After being the blonde Queen Bee in ""Mean Girls"" back in 2004, she went back to dark hair and did ""The Notebook."" Then in 2005 she made ""Red Eye"" in between ""Wedding Crashers"" and ""The Family Stone."" She may well be the best thing in all three of those films, but this is the one where she has to do the most heavy lifting. Her character is smart, which only makes her more attractive as far as I am concerned, and despite her vulnerability we do not believe that she will be a victim. There are some moments where both the heroine and the villain are conveniently stupid (when you get somebody down, go all in and finish them off: everybody in my family knows this), but there are enough smart moments and we are rooting for Lisa, so such slights can be easily forgiven.",N/A
644181,"The last scene was stellar but tell me, is that all that matters?United 93 has a clueless start (the airports, the staff, the government talks) and a great,great build up to a ""napoleon dynamite"" of a conclusion. It didn't sell consequence but tries to sell heroic significance which I can learn to respect. However, I must say, 9/11 was not a good day and it changed my world as much as it changed yours. United 93, even with a grizzling build up - failed to remotely emotivate me. It was emotionally impotent and quite a few strands (namely - the character build up, the understanding transferred to the audience) were strayed about.The reason I had big expectations from this film is because the particular incident changed a lot of things about our planet. It changed the way we Asians are welcomed in the west (Security checks, dubious random checkings by authorities,etc) , 9/11 brought the world closer and made the minorities more recognizable, a sense of cold dread adulterated with friendly humanity from all sides - - all in all, fills the world today. I had difficulty understanding how exactly the staff realized that the plane had been hijacked. There were a few loopholes I can overlook but the film really disappointed me. The acting is good but the direction, I feel, should have been more subtle yet impacting.Sorry, this film just didn't manage to move me.Harkanwar Singh AnandNew Delhi, India",United 93
716894,"Recorded just weeks after the terrorists attacks on September 11th, this once in a lifetime evening brought various artists together in New York City to raise profits, and also to raise awareness of the universal message of peace that John Lennon practiced before he was tragically murdered himself. Lennon's message came forth most of all in his music, and this DVD showcases the prominent singers and artists who supported his words as they take turns singing his classics. The best performances here are Stone Temple Pilots doing ""Revolution,"" Dave Matthews performing ""In My Life,"" Alanis Morissette performing ""Dear Prudence,"" and Dave Stewart and Nelly Furtado combining their talents for an amazing version of ""Instant Karma."" The old interview footage and commentary of Lennon between performances as he speaks of his values and the effect of religion and politics on society is an added bonus.

941859,"Can a murder mystery be sweet-natured? Yes, when it's Cover-Up, a well-crafted B movie programer put together by experienced pros.Insurance investigator Sam Donovan (Dennis O'Keefe, who co-wrote the script) arrives in a small town a few days before Christmas to look into the apparent suicide of an intensely disliked resident. The man has left a $20,000 insurance policy with a double indemnity clause. Sam points out to Sheriff Larry Best (William Bendix) that if murder happened the policy will pay $40,000. The sheriff is friendly but unhelpful. ""Look, Sam,"" he says, ""take my advice. Don't be so all fired anxious to pay double indemnity on this case. Why don't you forget about it? Go on home.""The sheriff says it was suicide, but there was no gun by the corpse, no powder burns and, at first, he denies a bullet was even found. Sam starts poking around, but everyone says it had to be suicide even though any number of the townspeople had motive. The dead man, the sheriff says, ""was a blight on the whole community."" Sam meets Anita Weatherby (Barbara Britton), the daughter of the town's banker. They start to get serious, but she wants him to stop looking, especially when her father might be involved. Sam, however, doesn't like murder and keeps pushing the case. He finally sets a clever trap, figures out the identity of the murderer...and has to make a tough decision. Let's just say the movie takes place over Christmas and Sam makes the right decision.This is a well-crafted look at a friendly small town. Main Street has two-story brick shops with the bus depot on the corner. The houses have wide porches and picket fences in front. People don't lock their front doors. The big event will soon be the lighting of the community Christmas tree in the town square, with everyone bundled up in scarves and coats and there'll be presents for all the kids. Don't fool yourself, though. There are plenty of suspects.The actors, especially William Bendix and Dennis O'Keefe, do fine jobs. Bendix gives Sheriff Best just enough complexity that you're never sure what his game is, or whether he's just being friendly or something more sinister. O'Keefe plays the big city investigator with a nice mixture of toughness and puzzlement. He wants to catch the murderer, but he's come to like many of the people, including the banker's daughter, and he's increasingly reluctant to hurt anyone. Dora Merande, one of Hollywood's great character actresses, does a memorable job as the Weatherby's astringent but caring maid.And as to that last decision Sam must make when he's discovered the murderer? He has to take a moment or two to think about things. ""Like the sheriff is so fond of saying,"" he finally tells those with him in the murderer's living room, ""I'm not much of a detective.""To avoid confusion, remember that the photo on the DVD cover has no connection to the movie. For some reason, someone pulled a scene from a completely different film to use. The DVD is bare bones. While there are chapter stops, there is no menu and no extras. The picture and audio are better than I would have expected. The movie is easy to watch if you're not a perfectionist.",Cover Up
661717,"""Walt Disney Treasures Silly Symphonies"" is a priceless collection of historical Disney cartoons ranging from the more primitive black and white animated shorts of the early 1930's to Disney's more sophisticated color cartoons which began to appear in the mid-1930's.After delighting in this entire collection, I find it superior in many ways to modern computer generated animation which looks good but doesn't stay with you.  Today's animated movies rely on big budgets, advanced technology, and high-profile celebrity voice-overs to make their point.I find that the beautiful and meticulous hand-drawn visuals and the lovely symphonic scores in the Disney cartoons convey volumes more than their high tech counterparts.  Many of the Disney cartoons contain no dialogue yet they are brimming with pathos, humor, and charm because of the richness of the stories and characters.  It is almost inconceivable that Disney's gifted animators literally toiled day and night making THOUSANDS of precisely calibrated drawings by hand in order to create movement or emotion in a story.Because hundreds of hours were required by a team of dedicated artists to complete just one ten minute cartoon, you get the feeling that these folks were doing more than just their jobs.  For most of their waking hours, they poured heart, soul, and sweat into their creations. I think this is the reason Disney animation resonates so deeply.Despite millions of dollars spent making animated features today, they fail to move me the way that an unassuming little masterpiece such as ""The Ugly Duckling"" does.  Dialogue and special effects are unnecessary to express the character's plight. I cry every time I watch Disney's ""The Ugly Duckling"".Another strength of the classic Disney cartoons are their pure and universal themes such as the longing and need in all of us to be loved and accepted. In modern movies simple messages are often lost amidst the hype and commerce.I feel fortunate that I was able to find this rare and outstanding animated collection.  My eternal thanks to Walt and company for the wisdom and vitality of their labor of love ""Silly Symphonies"".",N/A

And my mum, I swear, was thinking of her future (and at the moment, non-existent) grandchildren to watch this with. She's got a long wait.The only quibble I have about Cinderella & Disney films in general was the character designs are so limited. Cinderella could have easily passed for Sleeping Beauty; Lucifer the cat is the exact same cat who is in Alice In Wonderland, and the prince (who's name is never revealed) is exactly the same as Prince Eric, in Little Mermaid. (Who yes, I did have the doll of, but I preferred my Ken doll.)Cinderella is such a classic story, and there have been so many live action movies made since - Ever After, and The Cinderella Story for example. The film is also full of brilliant characters, the mice (""Cinderelly, Cinderelly""...""Gus Gus!"") are the only animals I've ever liked in a Disney movie, and the evil stepsisters are just fantastic! I actually hated them!!! Eleanor Audley is brilliantly icy as the voice of the evil stepmother, later went on to voice Maleficent in Sleeping Beauty.I'm still not sure why ""Bibbidi-Bobbidi-Boo"" was Oscar nominated, as I cringed listening to it, and watching it - it's just one of those songs, which is just so *insert your own word here* that you can't bear to listen to it.The film does however, lose it's magic after the ballroom scene, and seems obvious what is going to happen. However, not to your starry eyed youngster, who will straight after beg mummy for so much of the Disney merchandise that's aimed at kids now.Cinderella is still as magical to me, as it was so many years ago (OK, not that long ago, I am still in my early 20s after all), but unfortunately, my love of the film is clouded by being simply too old to believe in being able to fall in love with someone within hours of meeting them. It's the whole Polar Express bell thing again. I'm too cynical now, and no longer believe in the standardised Prince Charming. He doesn't exist. (He was too clean cut anyway.)There are plenty of extras to go with this special edition, but many are aimed at the youngsters, as that's where Disney DVDs are aimed at.

915903,"This is one of the new video's from The Firm. It uses their new transfirmer which is a step with two peices. This video (and 2 others) comes with the Transfirmer if you purchase it. There is a 6 inch and an 8 inch step that can be used apart or combined into a 14 inch step or an incline step. Allie DelRio is the teacher on this video. She is very personable. Some of the old familiar Firm faces are also on this video but there are some new people as well. One person in the back right demonstrates the beginner moves although the camera is not always on her.You will also need (besides the Transfirmer) 3 sets of dumb-bells: heavy, medium and light. They recommend 3, 5 and 8 lbs to start.This video is typical of The Firm, in that it combines cardio with weight training intervals. In short, this video starts off with a warm up and some stretching and then moves into some squats with and without arm work. After some lone arm work, you will use the 14 inch step for some leg presses. Then you'll move into a short cardio step segment that utilizes the inclinced step. Then you'll do some more leg toning with the 14 inch step. This switches with some arm work. Next comes another short cardio section that you'll march up and around the incline step and you'll tap on it and do some reverse straddles. Then comes a segment where you'll use the incline step to work on your legs (with some lunges) that also switches off to arm work using the incline bench. Another short cardio section follows with a lot of low jacks and box steps. Again, you'll use the incline box for arms and legs. Then you'll move to another short cardio section with a lot of bunny hops. Then some more arm work. At the end there is some buns/thighs work that uses the 14 inch step then some ab work and a stretch. Overall this video runs just short of one hour.The cardio segments are not as hard (nor as fun) as previous Firm videos. If you are not an experienced Firm user there will be a slight learning curve for this video... don't get discouraged! These videos are fun and you'll see results if you stick with it (or any workout program)! I don't think the stretching is especially effective and because this video isn't as hard or as fun as previous Firm's I am giving it a 4/5. Also, there is a lot of switching of Transfirmer positions and dumb-bell sizes, and usually it is done faster than I can do it. This means I usually have to stop and rewind the DVD, which is frustrating. I think overall the video is enjoyable and a decent workout.As an added bonus there is an 8 minute lower body workout using the Transfirmer added to this DVD with lots of squats and lunges.",The Firm - Aerobic Body Shaping
30286,"I somewhat braced myself to see a barrage of the ""Wh* Tr*"" label being thrown around when reading the reviews of this movie.  (A perfect negation to all who claim Americans are comparatively less class-conscious.)  If we can get pass additional loaded labels like ""Enfant Terrible"" and ""pretentious,"" maybe we can all start to see with a fresh eye.  It amazes me that so many people trumpet the greatness of American Beauty, but suddenly go sour when the movie Ricky Fitts would have logically gone off to shoot after he became tired of filming the flying bag in the whirlwind, is right here:  Symbolically, that small whirlwind in American Beauty that blew the bag around for a five-minute video has turned into the gigantic tornado that hit Xenia Ohio.If we can suspend our prejudices at the word ""Wh* Tr*"" for 90 minutes, then every image becomes a thing of beauty.  Is violence bad?  Sure. The allusions made from the image of a gang of drunk shirtless guys  beating up a chair is scary, I'll admit it.  But it doesn't make the image itself ugly.  In fact, it's quite gorgeous.  Whenever I find that I might get carried away with a little bit of snobbery, all I have to say to myself is this: If Francisco Goya was at that kitchen, if Durer was there, or even Kathe Kollwitz...would any of these artist chose NOT to document the moment?No.So we have to be very careful when we react to something as a result of our upbringing and prejudices versus the lifelong search for all that is truly beautiful.Traditional folk singer Almeda Riddle opens the movie with a wonderfully sung Rooster song.  Jacob Sewell (with androgynous supermodel looks) dons bunny ears and embodies the violence dished out on stray cats.  (The American Humane Society is noted at the end of the film as being on the premises to monitor and prevent any animal cruelty.  Prostethetics were used as well, just in case you were concerned).  I especially enjoyed the alternate settings of cruelty to cats (from the boys) and adoration (from girls), and the subsequent crossroad leading to that abstract object of desire disappearing...and ending up in the hands of the bunny boy.Everything in between is there for the taking.  You just have to check your sense of superiority at the door and take every image as it comes.For years, I've always said that a traveller to any country or town always brings a fresh eye to the way natives see the things they have taken for granted.  Korine mentions this about the cinematographer Jean-Yves Escoffier as well, saying that the Frenchman sees Nashville with the eyes of wonder (which we should all possess on a daily basis).Of course, it's possible to argue that if you look without discrimination, then taste and preferences are all but abolished.  You might as well just let the camera roll.  That's a mistake.  Taste and preferences (which, in another word is prejudice) are instilled in us.  When you come out of an instructive movie like Gummo, you begin to reassess what you have taken for granted (or flat out ignored) all along.  Hopefully you'll see your surroundings with a fresh new eye.",N/A

883540,"Primer is arguably the slowest movie ever made, far from being a primer in time travel it seems to be an advanced tutorial in stopping time.  Imagine four Silicon Valley techno-geeks talking simultaneously into barely functioning mikes and you have Primer.  The plot, such as it is, has also traveled through time, revisit old episodes of Rod Serling's Twilight Zone to see for yourself.On its face, the premise of time travel and the creation of alternate selves, manipulating or not manipulating events and thereby tinkering with the smooth continuum, would seem to be promising.  While it does prompt rather grandiose philosophical questions, (questions that exceed the grasp of Mr. Carruth who wrote, directed, starred, scored, edited, and painted the props), it defeats its purpose because there are simply too many possibilities.  Drama depends on well-defined situations and tension, in the silly-putty world of Primer, where anything can happen; there is no definition, tension, or suspense.Normally, when I learn that plucky kids made a movie for $7,000 I cheer, because Hollywood needs to know that big money does not equal quality.  (Robert Townsend's Hollywood Shuffle is a stellar example of film excellence on a shoestring budget.)  When I hear that a film is a Sundance winner, I'm immediately interested because this often points me towards movies that are small, overlooked, and wonderful.  But no system is foolproof, and Primer snuck through the cracks.For a mature look at time manipulation that does provide meaningful structure, try Last Year At Marienbad, Memento, or even Lost Highway.  Marienbad and Memento are brilliant, and Highway, while it leans heavily on signature Lynch weirdness to make its point, at least provides the visceral impact thoroughly lacking in Primer.  I'm afraid that Primer is little more than 78 minutes I'll never get back.",Primer
415122,"""Camelot"" on Broadway was cursed with the most excrutiatingly boring book that droned on and on and on.  But the production was blessed with a stellar cast including Richard Burton, Julie Andrews and Robert Goulet and an excellent score which included ""If Ever I Would Leave You"" powerfully sung by Mr. Goulet.Joshua Logan was tapped to direct the film version and of all the reasons why the film failed-Logan as the director was the biggest.  Richard Harris as King Arthur when he wasn't hamming it up acted so morose you would think someone told him all the pubs in England had run dry.Vanessa Redgrave made an enchanting Guinevere but her demeanor was somewhat on the frosty side.Although the film boasted scenes of castles, vast meadows and grand castle ceremonial halls, Joshua Logan filmed a lot of the movie using extreme close-ups of his actors.  And a tight close-up on Richard Harris' face on the giant cinemascope screen was especially distracting. When he sang his nose-hair could be seen swaying to the music. And on one of Vanessa Redgraves close-ups, it was obvious she had a cold, and a joker in the movie audience shouted, ""Arthur get thy wife a hankie,""--Ok! Ok!

1012338,"After the beginning of the sage of ""X-Men"" beginning with the 2000 original and going all the way up to a much grander scale with ""X-Men United"", the third in what is sometimes referred to as the trilogy of X-Men films entitled ""The Last Stand"" brings the epic saga to a glorious close. I am very much clueless as to why this movie seems to be getting far more negative reviews than it's predecessors. While far from perfect, ""The Last Stand"" is true to it's title: It is a grand finale to the current X-Men movie saga. Yet I just can't imagine how they can make a fourth one after the events that take place here unless they are doing Wolverine or Magneto spin-off movies.Some time after Charles Xavier's X-Men and his archenemy Magneto's Brotherhood of Mutants united against a common foe hell-bent on wiping out the mutant race, the two camps are suddenly torn apart in an acrimonious division between the mutant race as non-mutant or `normal' humans devise a medical substance that works as a `cure' for mutant powers and suppresses the genes that cause the mutant powers to manifest. The so-called cure divides the mutant community into several camps but the prominent ones are the X-Men lead by Charles Xavier who work to bridge the divide between mutants and non-mutants, the second is of the scientists devising the `cure', and the third and most vicious is Magneto's camp who views the `cure' as a tactic to commit genocide against the mutant community and he and his army aim to destroy this cure and will destroy anyone who stands in his way, even if it's a mutant. So the battle begins and the battle lines are now drawn. Xavier, The X-Men and their allies believe in tolerance and bridging the divide between the mutants and human beings but Magneto's Brotherhood of Mutants believes that mutants are the superior race on earth and aims to establish mutant control over non-mutants.The so-called cure devised on a research facility on Alcatraz Island was made in reaction to the news of an enormously powerful mutant with the ability to wipe out entire cities with one fell swoop. Jean Grey, who was thought to have actually died after sacrificing herself to save the others from a large flood, mysteriously returns to life but with a far greater power that manifest in the subconscious parts of her mind. This power sees Grey revived as the Phoenix. Yet these enormous news powers that have manifested in her, have made her a monstrously powerful mutant whose powers endanger everyone around her, both ally and enemy alike, mutant and non-mutant alike, as well as the entire planet.So the battle lines are drawn and the war begins between the three camps, the non-mutants protecting this `cure', the X-Men aiming to end the enmity between the races, and Magneto's Brotherhood organization's goals of mutant superiority. It is indeed the war to end all wars as so it is said. Who will turn out victorious when it is over?I am absolutely proud to have seen this movie. A major reason for this is that the whole idea of a `cure' for mutants reminds me of the bigoted beliefs in `curing' homosexual and bisexuality in human beings and the horrific consequences of these bigoted beliefs. While too complex to jam into this review, watching ""The Last Stand"" really reminded me vividly of the gay rights movement occurring across the United States with one camp being those who've made their inner peace with their orientation and the other being the camp that views homosexuality as a `disease' which is completely and totally absurd. Such behavior is documented in almost every species of animals including dogs, cats, as well as our closest relatives, the chimpanzees. Though there's much more about this that cannot be squashed into this review, ""The Last Stand"" story plot I felt has a lot of parallels to the battle against homophobia and intolerance against not just gays, lesbians and bisexuals, but also others because of their differences. There is no need for a `cure' for this orientation.The movies problems though are similar to it's predecessors. Rogue is just another false-angst-ridden teen who's reduced from a dynamite comic character to just a wooden stock character who has almost no role in the events. In fact, Rogue felt more like an cameo extra rather than a main character. I really like this character and the complex background but after seeing some improvement in ""X2"" over its 2000 predecessor, I was disappointed. I think they should do a Rogue spin-off movie to make up for this. My biggest disappointment was the small role of Mystique after her front-row seat in the last movie. After being a major staple in the last two, Mystique is almost completely absent after about 20 minutes into the movie.Storm though is an improvement and has far better roles in this than before. The movie also somewhat tones down some of the emotional weight in favor of tons of action and a dazzling array of special effect. The emotional part is definitely there throughout but in many areas, it gets lost amidst the heavy amounts of action battle sequences and special effects in many parts of the movie. Who knows what may come next but after seeing this, I don't see how they could make another one without the characters who were so much a staple throughout this saga unless it's a total reboot of the film series similar to how ""Batman Begins"" rebooted the Batman movie franchise after the disaster of ""Batman and Robin"" a decade ago.",N/A
217003,"This was never going to win any Oscars as a high minded production or awards for historical accuracy. But if you like Bob Hope style comedy it's certainly good for a laugh. Don't expect it to be too naughty - most of the humour is either innocent or indirect even by 1950's standards.I was reminded of this old Bob Hope farce when I watched the version of ""Casanova"" which came out in 2005 with Heath Ledger and Jeremy Irons.If you enjoyed the modern version you will almost certainly enjoy the surprisingly similar comedy which Bob Hope and his team had put together more than fifty years previously.Both stories are set in Venice, and both are based around the same basic joke. This is that Casanova's mere reputation as a great lover is enough to have every woman in Venice throw herself at him, including those who appear to be extremely respectable and virtuous, with precisely one exception - the woman he wants.Bob Hope plays Pippo Popolino, Casanova's tailor, who is tricked into impersonating the infamous rake (Vincent Price) who is hiding from his creditors. When Pippo Popolino as Casanova arrives in Venice in a gondola, strumming a mandolin as if it were a guitar and singing a love song, it immediately results in hundreds of beautiful women in elegant costume jumping into the canal to try to swim out to his boat.The fake Casanova has been hired by a rich and elderly dowager to test the fidelity of her son's fiance by seeing whether he can seduce her. An indication of the humour in the film is the dowager's acerbic aside to her son as they leave the meeting,""To think that I met him - fifty years too late !""Her son replies in horror ""Mother!""But the son's fiance is the only woman in the story who could meet Casanova and not fall into his arms the instant he expresses an interest. Of course, having accepted the job because he needs the money, at this moment the girl becomes interesting to him in her own right ...Also shares with the later film some brilliant period costumes, though they don't look as magificent with the cinematic technology of 1954, and an action packed fighting escape from the scaffold after ""Casanova"" is sentenced to death.This ridiculous romp was never intended to be taken seriously and has no pretensions to be more than a light-hearted series of jokes. But if you enjoyed either other Bob Hope films, or the 2005 film, or both, this is quite likely to amuse you.",N/A
223650,"'Ordinary People' is one of those films that everyone can appreciate.  Even if one has never been in this exact situation we have all still in one way or another felt the pain this family feels.  Regardless of whether you feel 'Ordinary People' to be the best film of 80 or the film that stole the crown you really can't escape the weight a film like this carries.  In the heartfelt and heartbreaking performances that seem almost too real we all can find a piece of ourselves and that's what makes this a brilliant film.The film follows Beth and Calvin as they mourn the death of their eldest son Buck who died in a boating accident.  Their youngest son Conrad is almost left in the cold, feeling blamed for the death not by just his parents but by himself.  Because of this guilt, because of this pain he tries to end his life, and if it weren't for his fathers intervention he may have been successful.  The film shows the growing animosity Beth has for her son, almost as if she wished he had drown and not her dear Buck.  There's one scene in particular that really struck me, when Beth's parents were over and they wanted a picture of Conrad with his mother.  The tension in her voice as she pleaded with them not to take their picture, it's heartbreaking.Mary Tyler Moore's performance to me was the standout, far cry from her sitcom days.  She showed every ounce of sincerity in what she was saying; how she was acting that an image of her tossing her hat into the air never once crossed my mind.  She became Beth.  Donald Sutherland is also a great actor, but his character being the quiet husband comes across background to the mother and the son which serve as the true body of the film.  Calvin is the heart, but the heart is rarely seen.  Timothy Hutton did brilliantly as Conrad, a boy so beat down by his guilt and so distraught over his mothers distaste for him that he can't function right.  Judd Hirsch plays the psychiatrist Conrad is sent to that befriends him and helps him come to grips with his real feelings.Between Redford's amazing directing debut and Alvin Sargent wonderful adaptation of Judith Guest's novel of the same name you have a great movie waiting to happen, and when you add the powerful performances by everyone in the cast you get that great movie.  Highly recommended to anyone!",Ordinary People VHS
971324,"I received this set from Amazon yesterday and spent most of the evening going through the three discs. The transfers are terrific. There is not a speck, scratch or splice on any of the episodes that I watched.From a TV history perspective, the ""lost"" pilot was very interesting. It is the same story as the first episode of the series. The pilot, however, was shot electronically with switched cameras and recorded on 16mm kinescope film. The episode was practically identical to the pilot--with some of the characters played by different actors. Notably, in the pilot Corporal Henshaw--Allan Melvin in the actual series--is played by Jack Warden. Paul Ford is not in it and the chaplain is played by Harry Clark who was Sgt. Stanley Sowicki in the series. The lost pilot is a great find and its inclusion in this set is a real treat.Also remarkable were the cigarette commercials done by members of the cast in character. There is a nice disclaimer before they are shown on the disc asking viewers not to smoke.Another neat extra is a scene from an episode performed live on the Ed Sullivan Show. This aired on the Sunday before the series began its Tuesday night run on CBS. Paul Ford blows a line (saying ""Bilko"" instead of ""bivouac"") but being the real pros they all were, nobody misses a beat and the show goes on.Allan Melvin introduces each episode and does an optional commentary over the first one. From the warmth in his voice and from what he chooses to remark upon a viewer can tell that he remembers what went on 51 years ago with great affection. George Kennedy also does an optional episode commentary. Phil Silvers explains to Dick Cavett in another extra that Kennedy was assigned as an Army officer to the show as a technical advisor. Silvers told him to get a Screen Actors Guild card and the rest is history.All of the series episodes were filmed in New York City, first filmed at 205 East 67th Street. This was a former Dumont television studio at what is now the location of Fox's channel 5 in New York. It was later filmed at Himan Brown's Production Center at 221 West 26th Street, today's Chelsea Studios. Allan Melvin, who passed away in January 2008, says they rehearsed in a hall over Lindy's bar and restaurant in Times Square. (Himan Brown passed away on June 4, 2010, at the age of 99. He was remembered for his radio dramas, among them Grand Central Station, the Inner Sanctum and The Thin Man. According to his obituary in the New York Times, Hi Brown recalled producing or participating in more than 30,000 radio programs.)",N/A
394099,"WHERE ANGELS FEAR TO TREAD got a bit lost in the shuffle of the film adaptations of E. M. Forster's novels that came out in the 1990s. Neither as much of a crowd-pleaser as A ROOM WITH A VIEW, as appealling to a gay audience at MAURICE, or as dignified and prestigious as A PASSAGE TO INDIA, this film instead featured the stars of each of the previous three Forster adaptations--Helena Bonham-Carter, Rupert Graves, and Judy Davis--and cast them very atypically in roles that seemed like poor fits for them each at the time but now in hindsight show off each of their considerable ranges. The widowed Lilia Herriton (the wonderful Helen Mirren, in a terrific performance) travels to Italy while chaperoning her younger neighbor Caroline Aboott (Bonham-Carter) on her first trip there, and marries a handsome young Italian man mostly to escape her interfering in-laws back in suburban London; they dispatch her brother-in-law Philip (Graves) to rescue her, but he is rebuffed by Lilia and her virile lover. But Lilia is miserable in her new mismatched marriage and dies soon after in childbirth; Philip and his puritanical sister Harriet (Davis) then return to Italy with Miss Abbott to get Lilia's baby at any cost. The story has often been classified as a comedy, despite the tragic deaths that occur in it, and the director, Charles Sturridge, plays up the comic elements of it considerably. Judy Davis dominates this film (as she does every film she's ever been in) with a raucous performance as a hysterical prude that is actually nicely shaded; while Bonham-Carter does much with the tough role of the unsteady Miss Abbott. Sturridge probably does not take as much advantage of the beautiful medieval towers of San Gimignano, where the work was filmed, as he should have, and relies too much on conversation (as might be expected from a director who has worked largely in television). But the film has nonetheless aged beautifully over the years (particularly since Davis's wild turn here is now less unexpected, and can be seen as more of a piece with her other later comic performances instead of as an aberration from her more subtle earlier dramatic work), and it deserves rediscovery in an American DVD version.",Where Angels Fear to Tread VHS

1016017,"I have just finished watching the second season of Boston Legal and I have very much enjoyed it. The relationship between Alan Shore and Denny Crane is the backbone of this series and both James Spader and William Shatner do a fantastic job, acting wise, with these two carachters. The dialogue is superb and there are many very clever and amusing moments almost in every episode. Very amusing also the quirky judges appearing in the various courtrooms: this show does definitely not take itself very seriously, something that is in itself refreshing. And interestingly enough, by keeping it light, it draws us quite powerfully into the serious issues regardless. The only complaint I have is the dissapearing of some of the female carachters from last season. I missed the sassy Tara and the two other female actresses from last year. They added some interesting dynamics and depth to the show, making the show a bit more than just about Denny and Alan. I did however enjoy the show very much despite this, in fact, I am looking forward to the new season. I am sure it will be, as usual, a blast.",Boston Legal - Season 2
620086,"""Eternal Sunshine"" was my favorite film of 2004, and one of my all-time favorites.  Given that Jim Carrey starred, that's quite a tribute to both him and the rest of the people (screenwriter Charlie Kaufman and director Michel Gondry in particular) involved with this delightful and imaginative project.  Both Carrey and co-star Kate Winslet play skillfully against type--he shy and introverted; she way off-beat.  Their trip through mind and memory takes awhile to get used to--like eyes adjusting to a darkened room, but it's full of wonderful surprises once you get used to the view.  Other treats include Elijah Wood (Frodo) role as junior memory erasure technician and Kirsten Dunst (Spiderman's girlfriend) quoting ""Pope Alexander's"" poem that gives the film its title.  My strongest recommendation--as long as you can handle a little (well a lot) of time shifting.",Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind

If you require realism and attention to detail when watching a movie or TV program, you won't be satisfied with this series. Otherwise, prepare to become absorbed into this great story interwoven with dramatic subplots and surprising twists which will keep you glued to the television.

994591,"Dario Argento, master of the Italian ""Gialli"" and one of the most celebrated horror directors of all-time, needs little introduction to the well-versed horror fan.  Early in his career, he delivered classic film after classic film, too numerous to mention but some of them include ""Deep Red"", ""Suspiria"", ""Phenomena"", ""Tenebre"" and the list goes on.  Unfortunately, the last 15 years have not been so kind, as he has been mired in a bit of a slump.  Every film since the decent ""Trauma"" (1993) has been somewhat lackluster, with the low point of his career being 1998's atrocious ""Phantom of the Opera"".  But I digress.  His works throughout the 70's and 80's are gold and we will always treasure his cinematic output of that era.  While ""Jennifer"" can hardly be considered a return to form, as some reviewers have dubbed it, it is a decent piece nonetheless.Writer/actor Steven Weber stars as weary cop Frank Spivey, whose life and sanity are destroyed by a fateful encounter with a young girl.  Frank interrupts what appears to be a murder-in-progress: a crazed maniac wielding a meat cleaver over a bound, helplessly cowering female figure.  Frank has just rescued ""Jennifer"", a mute girl with a killer body but who has a horrifyingly deformed face.  Confused by simultaneous feelings of repulsion and sympathy that course through him, Frank takes the girl into his house once he discovers that she's homeless.  He has fallen under Jennifer's morbid spell, as the girl systematically destroys his will, his sanity, his family, and his life.While ""Jennifer"" cannot be considered terrible, I would still have to rank it as one of the lesser episodes of the strong first season of ""Masters of Horror"".  It has the thinnest and most predictable plot of the episodes I've seen, as the ending can be spotted a mile away.  However, this is somewhat compensated by the generous amounts of graphic sex, violence and pure perversion.  The sex sequences are amazingly filmed, since they combine feelings of both excitement and disgust.  It has some exploitation elements euro-horror fans will adore.Jennifer herself is a study of contrasts; she has a stunning body but her face is hideously deformed.  She genuinely appears to be a pathetic, withdrawn creature who just wants to be loved yet her ravenous appetite for flesh makes her evil incarnate.  As a viewer, we're not quite sure if we're meant to sympathize with her or to loathe her.Maybe this episode was not all that it could have been since it was not written by Argento, but by Weber.  Or maybe Argento's time as one of the premier horror directors has long passed and his output from now on will likely never surpass the ""decent"" threshold.  Bottom line is ""Jennifer"" just didn't click with me, it's not horrible but at the same time it's not very good either.  Although some of Argento's trademarks from his earlier movies are here, the excellent camera work, the creepy children's music, and bugs flying around, this piece further goes to show that Argento is losing his touch as the story drags on and doesn't offer much to the viewer save for token scenes of cannibalism, sex and gore.  Argento is on board for an episode of season two so let's hope he can reverse this downward trend he's been on, although I doubt that will happen.",Masters of Horror - Dario Argento - Jenifer

When you watch the first 30 minutes of this movie, it seems to be rather a drama. No big special effects, no demons flying around.Hence this movie has a great charge of realism. We believe everything that happens is highly plausible. Perhaps it is because the script is extremely similar to the book.And the book itself is a great literature piece.The acting is supremely good, and aside the green puke, the especial effects used on Linda Blair are creepy enough to still scare you 30 years after this movie was shot.The extra scenes are equally as scary.A great horror classic that will never stop horrofying us...",N/A

In stumbles a bumbling young wizard/thief who may be Merlin's only hope for the people of Camelot.Though a few areas of the movie were painfully predictable, there were just as many unforseen twists to make the sequel interesting without encroaching on the magic of the original legend.Chrissy K.

643001,"Allen Covert, who we all know from his character parts in numerous Adam Sandler movies, stars in this film. The movie definitely has a familiar Sandler-type feeling to it, but I thought it worked well with the given cast.It all starts out with a hilarious scene where Alex (Covert) is being evicted from his place while playing video games. It turns out his roommate has acquired a penchant for Filipino hookers and he's spent all the rent money on his addiction. It sounds pretty weak, but it's a great scene and it's really well done.A good number of actors make guest appearances. Rob Schneider is the Middle-Eastern landlord, David Spade is a feminine waiter at a health food restaurant, Kevin Nealon is an overly spiritual boss, the kid from Dodgeball (Joel Moore) plays a video game designing genius who has a robot as part of his dual personality, the mother from Everybody Loves Raymond plays Alex's grandmother... Nick Swardson (who is a professional stand-up comic) is hilarious in his role as Alex's best friend at work. He really adds to the movie with his personality and one-liner delivery.There are some really good lines in this movie, as well as some strikingly funny scenes. I found myself laughing out loud more than a few times. If you liked early Sandler movies, you will definitely appreciate this kind of humor. The Unrated version is raunchy and even better than I was expecting it to be. There is also a good deal of bonus material, including some featurettes and deleted scenes.",Grandma's Boy
975182,"Michael Winterbottom's ""Tristram Shandy: A Cock and Bull Story"" is a film about filming the unfilmable--in this case, Laurence Sterne's famously discursive novel of the same name. The film is delightful as long as it concentrates on the film, less so when--about halfway through--it changes focus to concentrate on the filmmakers. Star Steve Coogan and his pal Rob Brydon set up enormous expectations at the beginning, sitting in their makeup chairs and carrying on a dialogue that's as hilarious as anything in the collected works of Christopher Guest or Larry David. The film then turns to a straight-as-possible film version of the Sterne novel, and is totally engrossing for the next half-hour. But then Jeremy Northam, playing the director, yells ""CUT!"" and the whole thing becomes just another dullish satire of blinkered, self-centered show-biz folk. Coogan and Brydon are still funny playing exaggerated versions of themselves, but the rest of it--including a long gambit about negotiating with Gillian Anderson to get her to appear in the film--is a big, fat yawn. Actors, producers and directors are never as fascinating as they think they are, and though movie critics can't get enough of movie moguls mocking themselves, rank-and-file audiences rightfully disagree. (These are the same shoals on which Robert Altman's ""The Player,"" another absurdly overpraised film, was wrecked.) I'd love to see Coogan and Brydon again, but as for ""Tristram Shandy,"" it's the archetypal curate's egg: Parts of it are excellent, and not the bigger parts, either.",Tristram Shandy - A Cock and Bull Story
355928,"I own all 3 of these Shirley Temple sets that have been released so far.  The sound quality seems to be going downhill...All 3 of the DVDs in Volume One were okay.  I was very pleased with that set.  In Volume Two, I noticed that the sound quality in Rebecca of Sunnybrook Farm was not that great (quiet voices and comparatively loud music).  In this last volume, the sound was questionable in The Littlest Rebel... but it was atrocious in Dimples.  It sounded as if all the actors were talking into pillows.  I have watched these films on VHS and the sound is fine... perhaps something went wrong when they were put onto DVD.I will say, however, that I absolutely love The Littlest Rebel and The Little Colonel.  They're probably my favourite Shirley Temple movies, so to find them both in Volume Three was great.  I was worried about The Little Colonel, though.  The last scene was originally shot in Technicolor; however, in Fox's last VHS release of the movie (colourized), they cut the scene!  I was so glad to see that the lovely ""pink party"" scene was included in this version... it's wonderful to see such an early example of colour in the movies.As with the other two sets, the colourization of the black and white films is good (much better than previous attempts).  However, the sound quality really annoyed me.  Had I known it would be so bad, I would have just skipped Dimples and purchased the other two DVDs separately.",Shirley Temple: The Little Colonel VHS

I thought it was a good idea to get people like holly out of there quick. Without them this match went along alot better. I was surprised when angle was the third elimenated. I thought it was going to be him and lesner. Good choice keeping cena in which gave him a bigger face push. Good match. Winner Team Angle. Match Rating 8.5/10.2. Molly Holly vs. Lita for the womens title- This was a above decent womens match. Molly is not my favorite diva on the list but she could always wrestle better than most and then you have lita who is always good in the ring. About a 7 minute match and a decent pace. Winner and still womens champ Molly Holly. Match Rating 5.5/10.3. Shane Mcmahon vs. kane in an ambulence match- This was not as good as there match at unforgiven but this was still a good match. It was about 13 minutes which i thought could have been longerbut it was still a good match. The only really bad part was the camara kept going off back stage. A really nice spot were shane jumps oof the ambulence. Also a nice table spot and some hardcore action. Winner kane. Match Rating 8/10.4. Los Guerreros vs. The Bashams for the tag team titles- This was one of the best tag team matches i have seen in a while. Good work by both teams. I think the bashams have gotten better in the ring. Good work by both teams. Winners and still wwe tag team champs the bashams. Match Rating 7.5/10.5. Team Austin vs. Team Bishoff- Match of the night by far. I forgot how good these elimination matches can be if you put alot of time into them. I thought that booker t and rvd got eliminated preatty quick. Back and forth action. An awsome comeback try by michales who was down 4 to 1. There was blood and lots of action. I did not like the ending but it still did not hurt the match. Winner Team Bishoff. Match Rating 10/10.6. Undertaker vs. Mr. McMahon in a buried alive match- I was hoping to get a little more from this match. Dont get me wrong the match was good but i think it could have been alot better. The one thing that was good was there was a few weapons used and lots of blood which made the match alot better. A surprosing ending if you ask me. Winner Mr. McMahon. Match Rating 7/10.7. Goldberg vs. HHH for the WHT- I liked the idea of when the wwe put these two together but i have not really enjoyed there matches as much as i thought i would. There match at unforgiven was rather sad while this one was a little better i think not by alot. I liked the fact that flair was there at ring side for the match he always helps during a match. I thought it was better than unforgiven by a little more. Winner and still WHC Goldberg. Match Rating 7.5/10.Well that raps up another. I would give Survivor series a grade of 54/70 which is a 77% which means it is a perfect ppv. I think that is a solid grade for two reasons. First off there really was not one bad match on the whole ppv. Second there were some awsome matches and just decent. I think wwe put alot into making this ppv special. I think you should get this dvd. If you dont mind and tell me if my review was helpful or not i would appericate that. Also you can check out my others by clicking on other reviews.

If you want the best family version, go with the Muppet Christmas Carol, which stars Michael Caine and is suprisingly good. But if you want to hear the same old story told in a new, effective setting, get this movie.  As a depression-era American miser whose experiences parallel Scrooge's, Henry Winkler gives a convincing (and at times heart-wrenching) performance. The supporting cast, including Dorian Harewood, also turn in exceptional performances. Nothing in this movie is tacky, anachronistic, overacted, or otherwise out of place - it is as well-crafted a Christmas movie as you can find. And if it leaves you completely untouched, let's just say that you may need some nocturnal visitors to give you Christmas spirit a special ""jump start"" this year.

The anti-drug company message is a little overbearing, but it works.Certainly, there are evil corporations in the world, and the plot is mostly plausible. On the whole, it's easy to believe that the events portrayed in the movie could occur - after all, the U.S. government has numerous times experimented on its own citizens. Look up the Tuskegee Experiment for an example. There are a thousand other examples of government doing evil to its own citizens. That's why I was kept spellbound throughout.The acting and cinematography are gorgeous. The African settings were wonderful and felt authentic.This is a murder mystery with an underdog hero and an ending that will leave you in a very meditative state of reflection on your own humanity.

684467,"Some films have a sadistic streak, and the director of ""Our Lady of the Assassins"" has shown his with this absurdly ghoulish film.  I cannot believe that life in Colombia is this hellish.  The story is interesting but is so outlandish.  As another reviewer said, many of the random killings are spurred on my stupid insults and complaints about bad service.  It is not credible to think a young man could gun down two men on a  train in broad daylight and just waltz away nonchalantly.As far as the acting is concerned, this was a one man show.  The progatonist--the writer who's come home--is clever and played decently.  The other characters serve as an audience to his quick wit and as the link between the civilized world (the writer) and the violent, savage one (the two boys he has a relationship with).  As another reviewer wrote, the symbolism is really heavy handed and propelled this film quickly into the realm of total absurdity.That being said, I did find it entertaining in a ghoulish sort of way.",Our Lady of the Assassins
932603,"The production style is traditional and the tempos are moderate - not too fast and not too slow.  The Queen is disappointing only in that her voice is not imposing enough and she does not look scary and evil enough, especially not with that large gaudy shiny diamond-studded crown she wears.  The most entertaining character, as expected, is Papageno who is dressed like an urban labourer with his blue-collar shirt (which is unbottoned near the top) with suspenders.  The only thing that tells you he is a bird-catcher are his feather-covered pants.  This Papageno is robust and jolly but lacks any avian eccentricities.  Rather than a bird fanatic, he looks like a simple-minded averge joe who is just trying to make ends meet and he fails the ritualitic tests miserably because he is too average, too ordinary and too proletarian compared to the noble, idealistic and well-bred Tamino, who, dressed in white, is played with passion and integrity in this production.  Pamina plays her part well but she looks a bit too old.  The Three Boys do not wear angel wings, but alternate between Roccoco formal dress and childish sailor suits.  Sarastro and his priests are grim and serious men dressed in long black coats, but Sarastro's voice is nonetheless deep and warm in a paternalistic way.  Monostatos is lustful, cruel and a caricature so (wonderfully) politically incorrect that it shows how old this Munich production really is.  Despite the age of this production by Sawallisch, it is still superior to many of the newer ones and probably even better than Levine's famous Met version.

Opportunity arises in Singapore for Jack Flowers, expatriate failed American writer, to add nobility to the world's most dishonored profession next to the lawyers and politicians.  If it were only that simple.  Despite running a brothel where the girls and the patrons admire and respect you the local competition uses less than subtle efforts to shut down your operation.  Then the U.S. military acquires your services to provide R and R for the boys getting a momentary respite from the Vietnam quagmire.  Even that doesn't feel clean.  Director-writer Peter Bogdanovich has fashioned a compelling morality tale in a place where morality wouldn't seem to exist.  The sweltering seediness of Singapore is captured perfectly here.

607248,"There's a built-in potential for disappointment in Comedian. The posters, DVD box art, etc. prominently feature Jerry Seinfeld, leading one to believe that it's a film with him as the sole focus. While Mr. Seinfeld is a major part of the film, Comedian both falls short of, and surpasses, the viewer's expectations.I thought the film was about Jerry Seinfeld's return to stand-up after a long and successful television career. While the film does indeed cover this, it also has a parallel story chronicling the struggles of Orny Adams, a talented up-and-comer who is shooting for his big break. It's presented with as much emphasis as Seinfeld's material, tranforming the proceedings.One is tempted to see it as a contrast: the pain of the scrabbling newcomer vs. the comfort of the experienced, wealthy veteran. But soon it becomes clear that it's painful for both of them - that a successful career can only do so much (that is to say, not much at all) to protect a comic from the stark vulnerability of getting on a stage and trying to make an audience laugh. It's always hard, and requires a great deal of work and focus to do.The true contrast is between how the performers approach their work. Mr. Adams is a knot of nervous insecurity, obsessively working and re-working his material, chattering non-stop about talk show appearences and development deals, privately scorning the audience after a perfomance falls short. Mr. Seinfeld, on the other hand, has a far better attitude. He treats the audience and his work with respect - he feels it's his job to make people laugh, and if construction workers can get up and go to work every day, than so can he, regardless of his success. If it doesn't happen, then he simply hasn't done his job.There are tense moments for Mr. Seinfeld when he forgets his material onstage, or is unsatisfied with a television appearance, but there are also calm ones. Quietly preparing backstage. Studying performances of Robert Klein and Richard Pryor at the Museum of Television and Radio. One touching moment has him gently singing to his baby before a performance. It's hard to imagine Mr. Adams doing the same. Indeed, his follow-up segment in the DVD supplement shows him looking lost and alone in a Los Angeles apartment, lamenting his television development deal, still restless and dissatisfied.Comedian is successful at describing the processes, attitudes and goals of two very different comics, as well as depicting the strenuous life on the stand-up circuit. Unfortunately, it's hard not to feel a little cheated when we don't get to see the final run of material Seinfeld has developed over the course of the film. In this regard, the film feels a bit choppy, an accumulation of sound bites that struggles to build to a goal. The DVD release has the Letterman appearances for both comics to compensate, but even this feels inadequate. Comedian splits its focus, attempting to straddle the banks of a making-of-a-concert film and a portrait of the comedy world. As such, it's successful enough to be compelling, but not quite the film it could've been.",N/A
736405,"The original Chippendale dancers absolutely made history, and Just Can'tGet Enough tells us the story in one of the sexiest, more historicallyfactual, and well-made movies about the time. It is so much fun to watchthat you will a)wish you were part of the Chippendale team, and b)want togo out and dance. Think Boogie Nights, Saturday Night Fever, and Studio54, only less Hollywood, more the true story of a particular place, and aparticular group of dancers -- one that would most certainly go down inhistory.Following the original gang that started the club, and the nameChippendale, the movie shows us what happened from the beginning, whennobody knew what they were doing, and everyone just had a dream....a dreamto make a lot of money using their bodies. It was really quite simple. Wesee how this plan affected the dancers' personal lives, how the money, andthe fame, started to take over their lives. Next we go through the yearswhen the club was thriving, when the money was rolling in, and the sex anddrugs were at everyone's disposal. Then, when gay men wanted to comethrough the doors to drool over the sexy pecs and big you-know-whats,things started to go down hill. Corruption took over, people ordered otherpeople killed, and eventually, the Chippendales were essentially murderedto the ground.

The whole video has a sea or maritime theme, though, which is nice because it thematically ties everything together, and the songs range from 1930s to the 1980s, including Disney's reprisals of even older songs (such as ""By the Beautiful Sea,"" which I suspect goes back to the 1890s or early 1900s).

176413,"V for Vendetta was certainly not what I expected. Instead of getting an in your face action flick about some do gooder we get a political film about an oppressive government using fear tactics to keep its people under control. And V is out to stop them. But is V really the heroic freedom fighter we are led to believe? Or has he become an evil himself? Who is V? Is he just some random guy? Is he some lunatic? Is he Eve's father? We don't really know. And even at the end of the movie we don't have a clue.V for Vendetta is set is the near future in London England. Something has happened that has left the United States in ruins and the rest of the world in poverty. In England an evil fanatic has seized control of the government. By using the fear of terrorist and diesis this new leader is able to keep the people under his iron grip. It is not a total nightmare government the way Gorge Orwell's 1984 was, but give it some time and it could get that way. Than out from no where comes V who brings with him a message of hope. He wants to start a revolution and overthrow the government. His tactic is to destroy parliament and kill the dictator.Obviously this movie is very political and not for the easily offended. If you can not stand people challenging your views than by all means skip this move. It will just make you faint anyway. Save yourself the aggravation. But for the rest of us who like debating other peoples views instead of slandering them, this is an amazing film. True it does some in fact talk about the Bush administration and the war against terror but reasonable people will not go out and slander the movie just for that. I am a republican Christian who is against gay marriage, and this movie has some pointed things to say about all of that. The government is a far right extremist group that justifies its actions somehow by saying it is the will of God. They murder Muslims and gay's and forbid any religion except Christianity while they try to justify what they are doing. But this movie doesn't just say ""republicans are evil bla bla bla"" it make its point in a very well written way. Muslims and gays are seen as people instead as enemies that so many people seem to think they are. Extreme right wing Christian fanatics are seen as just a dangeres as Muslim extremist, as in fact they are. Of course this movie slant to the left, but it does have a good message. Like don't ever give up your freedom, no matter what. Do not allow your government to use fear tactics to scare you into letting up your liberties. Never stop fighting, and if you must die for what you believe.V for Vendetta is a very good film, do yourself a favor and go see it.",N/A

978582,"Human Trafficking is a bold and ambitious project; Lifetime is to be congratulated for exposing a part of society most people would prefer to ignore, and doing so in a mature, serious fashion.  Originally designed as a mini-series, it is presented here in its entirety, with convenient breaks.  This is helpful, at three hours it may be too much for the average viewer to assimilate all at once.  Even the jaded appetite will find Human Trafficking upsetting.One must wonder about those who claim ignorance of sexual slavery as it is practiced around the world.  This appalling behavior is more than merely time-honored; it is codified and woven into the fabric of society itself.  What is surprising, and what Human Trafficking gets right, is that sexual slavery is alive, well, and lucrative.  Like drugs and weapons, a filthy business like this can only exist where there is powerful market demand, and that demand is chillingly close to home.Human Trafficking benefits from good directing, (Christian Duguay), and some splendid performances.  Leading the way is the lovable Scot from The Full Monty, (Robert Carlyle), who plays the Eastern block criminal mastermind behind the sophisticated sexual gulag.  His accent is impeccable, and his character well realized.  Sergei Karpovich is no Cold War ham-fisted brute.  He is smart, computer-savvy, and thoroughly ruthless.  (Like so many inner-city drug dealers, under different circumstances he probably would have been a captain of legitimate industry.)After Carlyle, the showcase performance here belongs to Isabella Blais, (Helena), one of the women whose decent into sexual slavery is tracked.  Helena is certainly not stupid, but she is vulnerable, and we watch in horror as one bad decision lures her into an unimaginable nightmare.  We also see some of the ingenious techniques used to ensure cooperation.  This is where Human Trafficking really shines.  It's never sensational, licentious, or titillating.  On the contrary, it exposes the complete banality of evil, the disturbing ordinariness of it in flat details that do not manipulate emotions.There are two problems with Human Trafficking.  At times it gets preachy, explaining the story rather than telling it.  (With subject matter this explosive, that is completely unnecessary.)  The other is the casting of Mira Sorvino.  Sorvino is a fine actress, (her performance here is fine), but she is simply too pretty and adorable for the part.  One scene attempts to show why she would take on the hideous assignment of catching these vermin, but it's not enough.  Making her character female was an interesting decision, but to work, it should have been someone with more edge and less curve.  Donald Sutherland, as her boss, excels.We imagine our society to be advanced, sophisticated, refined.  Thanks to the folks at Lifetime for shedding some light on the difficult truth.",N/A
1012925,"""The Break Up"" shot to #1 at the Box Office for a couple weeks, got pretty good reviews, but wasn't well received with audiences. Many people say they didn't like it because all the main characters do is argue and they didn't like the ending. Basically, the reason people don't like this film is because they were expecting a romantic-comedy in the vein of ""Failure to Launch"" or ""How to Lose a Guy in 10 Days."" Where the storyline is the same and the ending is the same. The Break Up lead people to believe via previews that this would be a comedy like that, instead...It is completely free of those cliches and is instead, kind of original. Even though some of the story elements (like the ending) reminded me of Annie Hall. Jennifer Aniston and Vince Vaugn play Brooke and Gary, a couple who co-own a condo and have successful jobs. Problem is, after a couple years together, Brooke finds Gary lazy and Gary finds Brooke pushy. One night, the two decide to break up. The problem is neither one of them wants to give up the condo. So they begin to antagonize one another until someone gives it up. Brooke has Gary kicked off their bowling team, Gary has a strip-poker party, Brooke gets a ""Telly Savalas"" and dates, Gary plays video games...Sometimes, they kind of just act like children. The movie isn't perfect; In fact, the movies I mentioned above that this film shouldn't be compared to might be better movies. If you watch this film with an open mind and no preconceived ideas of what you're going to see, you may find yourself enjoying it. Aniston and Vaughn are great as the feuding couple and Joey Lauren Adams and Jon Favreau add some great comedic bits here as well. The Bonus Features include an alternate ending, which is a perfect example of why alternate endings suck.GRADE: B-",N/A

It's more frantic by about a half-turn, and resembles the straight-faced, literary social satire in minitature of Philip Roth or Don DeLillo.  Huff is the narcissistic center among a hurrican of impressionistic semi-characatures.  There's more going on here than meets the eye.

157476,"After watching ""A Bucket Of Blood"" (1959), I have come to the conclusion that it is an earlier, bloodier variation of the movie ""The Little Shop Of Horrors"" (1960). Both movies were written by Charles B. Griffith.  Both movies were directed by Roger Corman.  In addition, several of the actors appear in both films.  For example, John Shaner appeared as a beatnik named Oscar in ""A Bucket Of Blood,"" and played the dentist Dr. Phoebus Farb in ""The Little Shop Of Horrors.""  In ""A Bucket Of Blood,"" Dick Miller plays Walter Paisley, a nerdish waiter at a Bohemian cafe.  In ""The Little Shop Of Horrors,"" Jonathan Haze plays Seymour Krelboyne, a nerdish worker at a flower shop.  After accidentally killing his landlady's cat and covering the body in plaster, Walter is acclaimed as a brilliant sculptor.  After cross breeding flowers, and accidentally creating a hybrid plant, Seymour is acclaimed as a brilliant horticulturalist.  Lacking any artistic talent whatsoever, Walter has to kill people and cover them in clay to create new statues.  Because the plant is a carnivore, Seymour accidentally kills people and feeds them to his plant, making the plant grow to gargantuan size.  Walter's boss finds out about what's going on, but doesn't tell the police, because of the money and notoriety it generates for the coffee house.  Seymour's boss finds out about what's going on but doesn't tell the police, because of the money and notoriety it generates for the flower shop.  After everyone realizes what's really going on, the police chase Walter.  The movie ends when Walter hangs himself before the police catch and arrest him.  After everyone realizes what's really going on, the police chase Seymour.  The movie ends when Seymour is devoured by the giant plant before the police catch and arrest him.  Because the violence is deliberate and the ending shocking and depressing, ""A Bucket Of Blood"" is one of the more obscure Roger Corman movies.  Because the violence is accidental and the ending is played for laughs, ""The Little Shop Of Horrors"" is fondly remembered as one of Roger Corman's best movies.",N/A
733406,"An incredibly affordable 2 disc set with great extras highlights two TV movie adventures of the Incredible Hulk.Bill Bixby & Lou Ferrigno's hit TV series set a milestone for comic book characters.  Before that, arguably the only superhero who had a hit was Batman & Superman in the movies.  TV movies and TV shows of everyone from Spiderman to Captain America to Dr. Strange had all either failed outright or fizzled quickly.  With Kenneth Johnson's drama of the Hulk, the creator turned Stan Lee's green pulp hero into something even grandmothers could love - and mine LOVED the Hulk TV series.Purists might object to the way the two guest star superheroes are treated and portrayed here.  I have no problems with either.  Both Eric Kramer (Thor) and Rex Smith (Daredevil) manage their respective roles nicely and have pure fun all the while - especially Kramer who turned an almost stiff, stodgy comic book Thor into a CA beefcake surfer dude with a love of mead and bar brawls.  Rex Smith turns in a three dimensional performance and honestly I like his portrayal of Daredevil much more than Ben Affleck's big screen turn.  Bill Bixby realizes his tortured Jeckyl & Hyde David Banner character as poignantly as he did in the TV series and the production values for both flicks are top notch all around.Comic fans must make concessions when their beloved heroes play up on the big or small screen.  When film director Bryan Singer toned down the X-Men's costumes for the theatrical film, many a true believer cried.  However when they saw the film, Singer was off the hook.  These TV movies are NOT the comics we grew up on and so much the better because they've become unique interpretations of them for us to enjoy alongside the classic comics, cartoons or the video games which will be created for generations to come.Anchor Bay has outdone themselves with excellent extras, packaging that evokes a comic book and even a booklet that at first glance makes you believe you're holding a collectible comic.

84161,"I was very into this movie at first simply because i love fairy tales.  But i must tell you it was a far cry from the interesting and creative colorful way they use to tell stories on fairy tale theater.  remember that? It started off slow, and then it picked up when she found the wardrobe into the magical forest, where she met and made friends with the human elk.  BUT THEN it went back to slow and boring as she found her way back home, tried to convince her brothers and sisters, of this magical place that she just found, where they all just happened to find it later by accident while playing hide and seek.Eventually they were all on a journey to stop the ice queen from keeping everything frozen all year as well as saving one of their brothers who wandered off into the arms of the ice queen while trying to betray his kin, all because of the queens promise to make him prince, and save the elk who was captured by her for not telling her that he saw the human girl in the forest in the first place.Anyway,  I was bored and unimpressed by the ""special effects, character's wardrobe, and boring setting,"" of this movie. In fact, I actually watched part of this movie one night, and it was so uncaptivating to me, that i watched the other half a few days later just to see if there was a chance it may pick up.  While i'm sure there has to be competition from another version of this film, i am not sorry that i bought it because i am an avid collector and if anything, i look at it as another movie version of it that i am able to have knowledge of and give my opinion on by comparing the lot. I give it 3 stars being generous, because of the story itself, not for the movie at all. I know they could have been more creative with this to make it a more magical experience.  If you are looking to buy this movie to entertain the children and keep them quiet, FORGET THIS MOVIE VERSION, i am sure you can find a more exciting version than this. The children will probably get bored and run crazy around the house while whining all the while ""when will this be over?""",N/A
25346,"I'm not sure I understand how anyone could come away from Fuller's ""Shock Corridor"" without thinking about the film for quite awhile, and also feeling very uncomfortable.  The story in and of itself is really nothing special, and is sort of a bizarre twist between something Jim Thompson and George Orwell might have written if they collaborated; pulpy with an almost cheap feel, the social implications of the ill fated Johnny Barrett's plight are far-reaching for not only 1960's America, but today's world as well.What takes place in this film is the brutal humanization of a man who goes looking for glory and success in a place where human beings are relegated to the depths of obscurity.  Johnny Barrett, a reporter working with police, feigns insanity to gain entrance to a mental hospital and unveil the killer of a patient, someone named Soames.  One doesn't get the impression that Peter Breck's character cares very much about the plight of the patient or his gruesome death at, as it turns out, the hands of the very people supposed to care for him--he just wants the Pulitzer Prize.  The only problem with Breck's character is that you only care about him when he's in pain: he comes off most of the time as a self serving SOB who doesn't care about his wisely foreboding girlfriend Cathy, played by the beautiful Clarence Towers.This is a gutsy film for the time in which it was made: Cathy begrudgingly pretends to be Johnny's sister in an effort to make him look like an incestuous maniac who may be a physical threat to her.  He is coached by a team of psychiatrists for a year (a YEAR?  I doubt it would take that long to fool most shrinks nowadays), and after a few violent fits he is thrown into the Dantesque mental hospital which will prove, in its humanity and unbearable nakedness of man's suffering, to be stronger than his petty pursuit of meaningless recognition.Johnny, as one might expect, gets a lot more than he bargained for.  In the course of his doomed quest he becomes intimately entwined in the psyche of severely damaged people, three of whom are victims of an indifferent and ruthless civilization: one, a young black man who plays a fictional composite of the first black student in the South, has been driven completely mad by the bigotry and abuse he encountered and believes himself to be the Grand Wizard of KKK, stealing pillow cases to incite race riots directed at another black patient.  Perhaps the most unforgettable scene in this movie is when he stands on up on a bench preaching white supremacy with the fanatical conviction only the insane can possess--and that's probably the point.  Another is a former Korean soldier who believes himself to be a famous soldier in the Civil War who, in reality, was actually absent at Gettysburg: he was brainwashed into Communism and considered too much of a shame by his country to remain part of the free world.  Another is an old man who behaves like a five year old, and yet before his psychotic break worked for NASA helped to construct the Atom Bomb.  In his moments of lucidity he explains why he chooses childlike madness over the mechanistic horror he has unleashed on the world.  Critics have cited this film as an example of bad acting, but these three performances are Oscar worthy, at least to my mind.The way the movie is shot draws the viewer into Barrett's bleak world and his selfish endeavor becomes a self-fulfilling prophecy.  Breck is only adequate for the first half of the film, but as his character slowly starts to crack, his talent shines.  This move is a must see and I cannot believe it is so little known.",N/A
1048735,"I had a such a opportunity to see this film on Advanced screening presented by Sony last night. There have been very controversial and negative gossips and publicities about this upcoming film ever since Sony pictures announced Daniel  Craig for new James Bond.After the screening ended I felt very strange.Well, movie was great.  It has great physical actions, less explosions and CGI, and focusing on characters great plots, great lines with surprisingly great delivery.  It clearly portraits where James Bond was coming from.  So as sake of the criticism of the film, it was darn good film.  The movie was darker and more realistic than previous James Bond sequels, besides On her Majesty Secret Service (which is also great film)  but those elements made this film great.My cons on this film would be:  Daniel Craig's bodybuilders body.  I always except old-fashioned hero as James Bond with natural athlete's body.  Like Once Sean Connery possessed.  And he does not have cookie cutter elegance and charm of Bond.  It does not make him a terrible Bond just to be fair.  I just didn't like to see James Bond is transforming into something different.  Just because of movie got realistic and darker, it lost it's corniness and fantasy aspects of film which is the charm of the franchise, but I think it was inevitable to make this good film.For the best or worst, this franchise has evolved something different, and we all are gonna be judge of this updated Bond franchise..........",N/A

963973,"My biggest fear was that this movie would be just another knockoff of Apocalype Now or Platoon, but it really wasn't.  It took a slightly different route, showing more of the politics and and soldiers struggle with everyday military life, not just concentrating on the horrors of war.  This would be more like a Full Metal Jacket, but updated for the new millenium, with a different story line. This didn't deal with the grunts of the military, this dealt with a more elite group, the Snipers.  What do these guys do in their downtime, which appeared to be quite a bit for this subspecialty.  Private Swoff ( Jake Gyllenhaal) is the character that drive the plot and narrates.  This movie is worth watching if you like Full metal Jacket.

970913,"Let me get the technical details out of the way first. The transfer is superb, picture quality excellent, sound excellent and it's letterboxed so you get it in the original ""drive-in"" aspect ratio. The only technical detail in ""Creation..."" that's sub-par is they needed better proofreading for the subtitles. There are a few errata, and if, like me, you use the subtitles, that can make the brain itch.""Creation"" itself, however, remains eminently watchable and utterly undated. Yes, it's a low-budget ""B"" movie. But the sets are acceptable, and the acting and dialogue at least as good as any TV series of the early 60s.

NOTHING in this film strained the cables on my suspension of disbelief.But as science-fiction, this movie shines like a well-lit diamond for thoughtfulness of script, philosophical depths explored, and some very human and HUMANE moments. I've never been able to forget the line about ""Irony, the funniest form of humor."" since the first time I watched this film back in the sixties. When I found out later in the story just what Pax (a Clicker) meant by that comment and the joyous peal of laughter which accompanied it, I agreed with him, and laughed like hell.And wait for a line that begins ""Only the memory..."" For that line alone, I would have bought this picture, because that line, perfectly delivered by Don Doolittle, contains the true humility that marks all real scientific endeavorers. It also raises philosophical questions that haunt me to this day.I can't speak of ""War Between the Planets"". I found it unwatchable.But I don't care. I've wanted a GOOD copy of ""Creation of the Humanoids"" in my collection even before I knew a collection was possible, and now I have it. Both my budget and my time are at a premium, but this incarnation of that picture is worth every penny I spent getting it, and every wonderful minute watching it.

899191,"The problem with this film is I read the book.  I was disappointed simply because `Be Cool' is an obvious showcase for the musical talent.  The overly long dance sequence with John Travolta and Uma Thurman is a prime example.  Somewhere the bulk of the story was lost--and there are some very--very good characters appearing in the film that would've been more intersing if somebody would've said, ""HEY, don't forget the book!""  But being true to the original source is not Hollywood's strong suit.  ""Be Cool"" provides some popular music, some known faces, but without John Travolta, the movie would never have been made.A few laughs are provided.  A couple ironic scenes show up, but there's too little to sustain a full-length feature.  Basically, the project is a disservice to everyone involved.  Some of the characters are so thin--face it--poor Christina Milian as Linda Moon, is reduced to being a voice that sways when she sings--a clich&eacute;.  The Rock does the best he can but again, `He's a gay bodyguard;' he's the  brunt of insulting jokes offered up by a Raji, his boss [Vince Vaughn], who, in the book, is far more sinister--but in the film he's an idiot.Of course Chili is Chili. Travolta does a very nice job, and Chili's obviously the smartest guy in the room.  Uma Thruman's performance is, well, not funny--not serious, not intense--not much-- at best, she made me shrug.  I do like what Harvey Keitel did with Nick Carr, but there's just not enough, and all the negatives reflect completely on the director.

1001408,"Poor Mr. Lazarescu. His head has been aching all day, he's been vomitting and yet no one will help him. He's called the ambulance twice, and it has taken forever for it to arrive. He's even visited his neighbors to ask them if they have any painkillers, but, they seem a little annoyed. Not to mention his brother-in-law is hounding him about money he owes him.This is pretty much the set-up to Cristi Puiu's ""The Death of Mr. Lazarescu"". And the title gives away the ending, so, we are only left with the middle.""The Death of Mr. Lazarescu"" is one of the first, if not the first Romanian film to receive huge international fame and actually be released in America in recent times.Ever since the fall of Communism in Romania the country has struggled trying to find its voice. Strickly speaking about their films (we won't even dwell in their politics) they seem to be drawn towards dark, cynical comedies that they think will appeal to western audience (namely Americans). But, Romanian humor is hard for Americans to digest. Most people do not understand our Eastern European humor. Because of this these films have either, not been released in this country or have not gained much cross-over audience appeal.The solution, of course, is easy. Romanians have to make films that are personal to them, not worry about what will appeal to Westerns. Now that Communism is over, why not make films dealing with life under its rule? Romanians could make human drama dealing with people and how life has changed since Communism's fall. Some films have attempted to do this, but with that dark humor. If Americans are familiar with Romanian films, there is a pretty good chance it is through the films of Lucian Pintilie and ""The Oak"", which dealt with the very subject of old world Romania meeting new world Romania.What all of this has to do with this film is ""Lazarescu"" is at least addressing a ""Romanian"" problem, but, it has universal appeal. See, if you stick to what you know, others will not only follow, but relate.The film has a pretty unusually style that American audiences might have a hard time getting adjusted to. The movie was shot primarily with a hand held camera. Why? One could say, well, it's because Romanians have no money and this is the cheapest way to make a film. I'm not sure that's the real reason. I think Puiu wanted the film to be shot this way because he wanted us to feel we are watching a documentary. We are suppose to think of this in terms of being real. Situations such as this really do happen all over the world.Much of the dialogue is terribly cynical. I didn't find the dialogue particularly funny, but, the situations were humorous. At time I started to wonder though, can it really be true? Can this really be the way doctors talk to their patients?So much of the film feels true. We are really going along on this man's journey as hospital after hospital refuses to keep the man and find out exactly what is wrong with him.I think the film also goes beyond just being a satire of Romania's health care system. It is also an attack on bureaucracy. The red tape government officials make us go through.Director Cristi Puiu says this will be the first of a series of films he plans on calling ""stories from suburbs of Bucharest"". There will be six in total as Puiu says he was inspired by Eric Rohmer's ""six moral tales"". In his own words he says the film is about man's regard towards his fellow man. Hopefully with the success of this film, which has won awards at various international film festivals including; Cannes, Norwegian, Transilvania, Independent Spirit Awards and in Chicago, we will see the five other stories in the series.Bottom-line: Very dark and cynical look not just at Romania's health care system but also a satire on bureaucracy. Director Puiu's debut film carries a nice pace to it by managing to really engage the audience due to the simplicity of the story and the human involvement the actors bring to their roles.",The Death of Mr. Lazarescu
169000,"I read a lot of the reviews before deciding to leave one of my own. Although I appreciate the concerns of people who dislike the inauthentic aspects of the film (non-Japanese actors, costumes from multiple time periods), I also appreciate that it can be really tough to get an ""art film"" financed and produced. I assume every compromise had a reason, and the end result still is that this film is beautifully done. Like many Westerners, I am not good at detecting whether a person is of this or that Asian heritage, but this is not very important when it comes to enjoying the story.  What matters most are the plot and the emotions of the characters. I found fascinating this intimate epic about a poor girl raised to be a geisha and learning how to reach the top of her profession. For me, watching the DVD at home without feeling rushed or tired, the pace was perfect. The novel is wonderful and so is the movie. Yes, the novel may be better (often the case when books are translated into film) simply because a book takes more time to complete, has more interior dialog, and draws you deeper into the characters. The actors here all are excellent, conveying the characters much as envisioned when I read the book. I do agree with James Gebhardt ""Film Addict"" that it might have been good to use an Asian director. There certainly are many great ones. But if the Chinese director Ang Lee can make ""Brokeback Mountain"" without criticism for being of a different race than his cast -- why can't an American make a Japanese film? BTW, the DVD extras are terrific, both entertaining and educational. I think the 2-DVD set is a bargain.",N/A
955480,"`The Constant Gardener' is based on a John le Carr&eacute; novel of the same title, and is sometimes referred to as a thriller, but what you see in this beautifully-shot film is not exactly about the secrets of murder or the cover-up of the government. The film's content might look in fact nothing new for those who are interested in Africa and its problems, and the thriller part itself often sounds rather conventional to those who have seen the films of the genre.`The Constant Gardener' is most impressive when it shows the love story between the married couple - mild-mannered British diplomat Justin and idealistic activist Tessa both living in Kenya. Right at the beginning of the story, Justin is told that his wife is killed while driving a truck with another man. While following the orthodox course of thriller with the determined protagonist investigating the truths behind her death, the film's first part, fragmented with skillful editing, shows in occasional flashbacks how these two people met in London, and how they see the world differently.Rachel Weisz received an Oscar for the part she seamlessly fits in, and you will soon realize that she well-deserves the award. That doesn't mean that Ralph Fiennes is not good. The fact is this is one of his best performances in his recent films. Virtually the film's emotional power stems from superb acting from them and other capable supports including Danny Huston and Bill Nighy. Plus, the film's realistic look of Africa often reaches the territory of documentary, shot in the real shantytown and real people in there, but the film also does not forget that the film is basically a thriller with constant supply of surprises and mysteries.Not every surprise and mystery work, though. The mystery itself is plausible, but as the gripping story goes on, the film in the second half sometimes relies on the hackneyed methods like computer hacking and a wizard kid. Fast cut and semi-documentary touch barely hides it, but the core of the story is pretty conventional political thriller, something that you might have read somewhere else.But the most touching part (and least conventional part too) is the Justin's quest for the truths about the meaning of his wife's life. Only at the very end, and at the very right place, he comes to understand Tessa and her value. He pays the price, and some might think the price is too high, but surely the film has made a point.

He's a successful solictor; she is the wife who wants to please him at the cost of her own happiness.  When the husband of their housekeeper is killed by a hit and run driver, events are set in motion that will change their lives.The movie doesn't have enough suspense to be a thriller, but it does examine what one might do to protect a loved one and/or their reputation.

956131,"Wow, I really can't believe how bad the reviews were for this movie. Not only here at Amazon, but at other websites and offline critcs, too! This is actually a fairly decent horror movie, when you consider it's own merits, without expecting it to be a ""carbon copy"" remake of John Carpenter's original. It's got all the horror essentials: suspense, shock, flaming corpses shooting accross the room, spooky goings-on in a small, isolated town... And compared to it's 2005 ""horror"" competition (e.g. ""Boogeyman"", ""The Dark"", ""The Cave"") it certainly belongs in the top ten of 2005 horror movies.The changes that were made to the plot and characters were very appropriate. Just enough to make the movie seem ""new"" and a little bit different than the 1980 original. The change of ""era"" was obvious, I thought, since the original was set in ""present day"" 1980, why shouldn't the remake be set in ""present day"" 2005, popular culture and all?  The story progresses at a good rate throughout the movie, which I like because there are no slow spots where you get no relevent information (basically just ""filler"" to make the movie longer) and no saturated spots where everything spills out all at once.  The ending left a bit to be desired, but it was somewhat unexpected and allowed for a simple conclusion. Also, I'm not a big fan of many of the actors in this version, except, of course, Rade Serbedzija (Boris the Blade!) who is one of my favorites.To be honest, I was never much of a fan of the 1980 original (as far as horror movies go) despite its star-studded cast and brilliant director... still, I believe that this remake was very well designed and executed. I'm glad that I did not let all the negative ratings deter me from renting this movie!  Otherwise, I would have missed out on a good new horror flick, which I will soon be adding to my collection.  If nothing else, you can rent this movie and decide for yourself.",N/A
607847,"An oft-repeated phrase throughout this film is that with the CIA, nothing is what it seems.  Unfortunately, that is not always true.  If this film seems to drag a bit at times, that is what it seems.  If it seems a bit repetitive and lacking in originality in dialogue and plot situations, that is what it seems.  If it seems that the star power of Al Pacino and Colin Farrell aren't enough to raise this film from B-film levels, that is what it seems.Farrell is supposed to be a techno-geek.  Okay, most techno-geeks I know do not look like Colin Farrell even on Farrell's worst day.  So, suspension of disbelief is required from the outset (one can make the same criticism of Keanu Reeves in the Matrix films, but those were much better films).  Farrell as James Clayton is a programmer geek by day, sexy bartender by night (that part is convincing).  Clayton is the sort of person that Walter Burke (played by Pacino) seems to want in the CIA, so he sets out to recruit him.  Clayton has a secret buried in his past - his father disappeared, and he always suspected that it was a CIA or some similar agency operation that caused it.Forward to 'the farm', a training ground for CIA operatives.  Most people wash out, and Clayton (apparently) does, too.  However, he is then recruited again by Burke to be a super-sleuth - the kind of operative that works off the books and under the radar.  The mission is to secure a computer programme capable of taking over virtually the entire plugged-in world, which exists in the computers of the agency, but nowhere else.  Of course, the computers at the agency don't have disc drives or printers or any other such storage devices to make theft easy.This is the first point at which the story goes off the rails, because the theft mechanism appallingly simple, and we find during at least one scene that the agency's computers are internet-linked to an agent's home computer.  So much for not being able to get information off the reservation.  But I digress.Farrell's confused acting put together with Pacino's overacting lead to a less-than satisfying, anticlimactic denouement.  There are plots within plots, and, true to form, the storyline tries to craft each person as being not what he or she seems, except that the viewer can figure out fairly quickly who is and is not in the frame.The deleted scenes don't add much to the overall experience of this film, and the final scene, alas, is definitely a set-up for a sequel, should we ever be so unlucky as to find this being made.If it seems that there was potential for this film, between the actors and the idea, that is what it seems.  Unfortunately, it seems that the film could never decide whether to be a mystery or an action film.  In the end, it comes close without quite reaching the level of being good at being either.One thing that might be worthwhile is the featurette, 'Spy School:  Inside the CIA Training Program' - however, does anyone really believe that the agency is going to put very much of high security value out before the public on a mass-market DVD?  Again, nothing is as it seems.This would be a great film to be remade a decade or two from now, with a better script and tighter plot, and a decision as to whether it is in the action or the mystery genre.",The Recruit

569349,"""Elmer Gantry"" has always been one of my favorite films, and it definitely is time to see an upgraded DVD version of this timeless classic.  For this is a movie that I think is timeless and relevant.  The movie, set in a world of tent revivalism, accurately predated many of the scandals we saw in the world of tele-evangelism throughout the eighties, nineties, and present day.  That a film from 1960 could still reflect current trends is absolutely amazing to me.  Every time I sit down to watch ""Elmer Gantry,"" it blows me away.For those who have been cautious about approaching a film based on evangelism, let me assure you that this is glorious entertainment.  Not staid, austere, or preachy--""Elmer Gantry"" is a rare film that reinforces religious conviction at the same time it is subverting the subject.  For on the surface, Gantry is a charlatan and a performer.  The film is an expose of corruption and hypocrisy within the religious community portrayed.  However, his character is counterbalanced by Sister Sharon--a flawed woman of real faith.  At first, you feel her participation makes her complicit in wrongdoing--but eventually you see a raw passion and clear belief emerge.The movie benefits from great performances.  This is the quintessential Burt Lancaster performance, one that won him an Oscar.  Elmer capitalizes on the charm and magnetism that made Lancaster a star, and he is so robust, vital, and alive--it may be the showiest, yet grounded, performance in history.  Shirley Jones also picked up a well deserved Supporting Actress Oscar for her out-of-character role as a prostitute.  Very evil and seemingly having the time of her life, this is a far cry from ""The Partridge Family"" or ""Oklahoma.""  But, for me, the heart and soul of this piece is the overlooked (and always underrated) Jean Simmons.  Her Sister Sharon is a remarkably complex character, one of the most well rounded portraits of a religious leader in film.  Far from a saint, she is ambitious and lustful.  Caught between right and wrong, she is also a devout believer who genuinely wants to spread goodness.  It's a perfectly nuanced role.With an Oscar winning screenplay, as well, this is a pitch perfect examination of faith, duty, loyalty and choice.  It's a powerhouse of emotion--as real and relevant today as it was over 45 years ago.  But more significant, it is absolutely entertaining--it's fast, wildly dramatic, and wickedly funny.  So for whatever reason you may approach ""Elmer Gantry,"" approach it you must.  Not necessarily considered an epic, to me ""Gantry"" is a true classic and epic in every way.  KGHarris, 11/06.",N/A
311930,"No true middle ground exists for this Roman Polanski-directed 1971 filming of Shakespeare's MACBETH; people either love it or they hate it.  Such often happens with provocative movies like this, whether it's Shakespeare or something else entirely.But in bringing this most hard-edged of the Bard's plays to the screen, courtesy of Hugh Hefner's Playboy Enterprises and noted British critic and playwright Kenneth Tynan, Polanski not only stayed faithful to the play's dark, gothic, and tragic tale of betrayal and murder, he took many elements of the story that usually are done offstage and put them onscreen.  It is those elements that a lot of the derisiveness towards his telling of MACBETH is directed at.  This is clearly not a repeat of Orson Welles' 1948 version, nor Kurosawa's THEATRE OF BLOOD, by any stretch of the imagination.Working with an all-British cast, notably Jon Finch (later to achieve notice as the beleagured innocent man of Hitchcock's FRENZY) as Macbeth, and Francesca Amis as Lady Macbeth, Polanski drips his version of the play largely in blacks and grays, with plenty of supernatural imagery--so much so that this could easily be classified as a horror film.  That incredible feel is enhanced by the first-rate cinematography of Gilbert Taylor, who worked with Polanski on his 1965 horror opus REPULSION, and with Stanley Kubrick in 1964 on DOCTOR STRANGELOVE.There is no denying it, however.  Even now, thirty-five years since its release in late 1971, MACBETH remains an incredibly violent and graphic piece, very much in keeping with the Bard's intentions, and that violence, which includes several instances of severed body parts and much blood, placed it alongside two other notable 1971 films (Peckinpah's STRAW DOGS; Kubrick's A CLOCKWORK ORANGE) as a touchstone for the impact that graphic cinematic violence could have on the world at large.  And quite a good bit has been said about how much impact the horrific 1969 murder of Polanski's wife Sharon Tate at the hands of the Manson clan had on the director's storytelling.Much of the latter, however, remains in the end a sidebar to this lengthy but compelling dark story.  In the end, like Zefirrelli's superb 1968 filming of ROMEO AND JULIET, this version of MACBETH stands out as perhaps the best example of cinematic Shakespeare sans either Welles or Olivier, and still remains intriguing.  But be advised because, again, this is definitely NOT a film for the younger set, or people with a low tolerance for extreme violence.",Macbeth VHS
65431,"In 1932 Universal Pictures was the premier horror house. And it's surprising how many of those films (Dracula, Frankenstein, etc.) have survied right up to today, as well as having generated countless sequels and derivative films. In those low budget, black and white days, all a director had to work with was makeup, a well made set, and the skills of the actors. And Universal had one of the best actors in the horror business - Boris Karloff. He was a man whose eerie looks and overwhelming stage present could scare his beautiful co-stars to death, along with more than a few million viewers.In The Mummy, Karloff had the perfect script for his talents. From his first subtle movements as Imhotep returns to life Karloff's presence dominates the film. No as a monster, but as a man made monstrous by his passions. 3700 years ago he was buried alive for trying to bring princess Ankh-Es-En-Amon back to life. Now an overly curious archeological assistant has read the Scroll of Thoth again and Imhotep is awake and determined to reclaim his mistress. Her soul has migrated to the body of Helen Grosvenor (Zita Johann). Helen and those that are trying to protect her are in mortal danger.Karloff manages to play Imhotep as both terrible and sympathetic. Imhotep is, after all, a man who has lost the love of his life, and is in danger of losing her again. Behind the makeup Karloff manages to project both his fury and the infinite tragedy of his fate. Zita Johann, a stage actress of some note at that time, does an excellent job of having two personalities in one body. For each she displays a full range of emotions and gestures.Our taste in horror has changed radically over the years (remember the latest remake of The Mummy or Friday the 13th?) but this film with its honest values and close scripting still can stand on its own. It has its subtleties and is lotal to its characters. The sets are excellent and Karl Freund's camera work is compelling. In many ways this film deserves credit as one of those defining moments in US filmography.",The Mummy VHS

217581,"This isn't the kind of movie where the characters break into song at the drop of a hat, but there are a lot of musical numbers.  Bing sings for his audition, has a flashback of himself recording a song, sings as part of the broadway show he is starring in and he even duets with a cabaret singer at a bar.  None of the music is especially interesting and it sometimes slows the momentum of the story.As far as the acting goes, everyone comments on Kelly and Crosby, but Holden is the pro here.  He gets taken for granted because he's done this role so many times and he makes it look easy.  Granted, Crosby is a revelation, but it's more because he is playing so much against type.  And Kelly is doing her best Ingrid Bergman impersonation.  I swear she even takes on Bergman's accent.  It just left me thinking how much better Bergman would have been in the role.  The fact that she won the Oscar just shows that politics win Academy Awards.  Any of the other four actesses were more deserving.The movie itself has a good story with some surprises, though it's a little stagy.

9467,"A movie I watch 2-3 times every year right about spring training time to get myself into that baseball mood. It really gives you that feel for baseball and why people dedicate their lives to it, in whatever capacity. The color and camera work captures the feel of baseball in yesteryear. So much of this story is told without detailed dialogue- a sign of a great movie. And so many words of wisdom - truisms, are uttered so casually that if you miss them, you miss so much of the very essence of this film. Redford is perfect as Roy Hobbs, as is Wilford Brimley as manager of the lowly New York Knights. But Robert DuVall and Kim Bassinger play great supporting roles, as do the rest of the supporting cast members, many who will be familar character actor faces. I never read the book, but know that those who have take umbrage to the license the movie takes with the story and how they present it. If you haven't read the book that won't affect you. What will affect you is Levinson's direction and the feel for the era he creates with the simplicity of the dialogue, the cinematography, and the color and lighting used, not to mention Randy Newman's period setting musical score, which is magical in setting the necessary moods. You feel like you're in another era. This Natural also contains my favorite quotes in movie history, when Glen Close utters, ""I believe we have two lives- the one we learn with, and the one we live with after that."" That quote embodies this film, and is my credo. Redford's hospital bed quote of ""some mistakes we never stop paying for,"" also is quite profound. A great movie with a great ending, that was almost reenacted in the 1988 World Series with Kirk Gibson's magical game winning home run in game one against the Oakland A's.

637839,"While the original movie of ""King Kong"" will always matter, I believe this is the version that all people who enjoy this story will turn to.  It is so much richer that the film has its own kind of majesty.  It isn't just a monster or a beauty-and-the-beast kind of tale.  This version is a metaphor for man's overestimation of himself and his abilities balanced with a story on the power of nature both as an external environment and as an inner drive.This vast movie has three large sections.  First, is the setup in New York in the 1930s.  Ann Darrow (Naomi Watts) is a down and out vaudeville performer with dreams of being in a stage production by her favorite writer, Jack Driscoll (Adrien Brody).  Carl Denhem (Jack Black) is an almost-but-never-been movie director/producer is desperate to make a film and finally make it, but his backers want to sell off the reels he has as stock footage.  His female lead has backed out and he has to find a replacement.  Denhem and Darrow happen to meet and he talks her into doing the film.  Denhem has conned everyone, but everyone really knows they are being conned, but in the hearts want to participate anyway.  Even Driscoll manages to get caught up into Denhem monomania.The second portion takes place on Kong's home island.  It must be vast to support the huge life forms and the huge canyons and cliffs.  But reality isn't the point here.  The inhabitants of the island are truly savages and are decadent descendents or interlopers of the people who built the ancient wall and buildings.  The battles Kong has here to demonstrate his strength and supremacy go far beyond anything the first movie offered.  Of course, it is vital to notice the creatures in this natural jungle versus the mechanical creatures in the human jungle later in the film.  Be careful with young children, a couple of the battles with some of the fauna get to be pretty creepy.There are several key developments for the main characters here that matter later in the movie, but the key relationship is between Darrow and Kong.  She is a better survivor here in a particularly vicious nature than she was in the city, but Kong's protection gives her enough time to appreciate his majesty.  Driscoll and Darrow develop a mutual, but unstated affection and it is Driscoll who goes back to rescue her from Kong and the jungle.The third portion has Kong completely out of his environment and chained for the amusement of chuckleheads, well-dressed chuckleheads, mind you.  When Kong is presented with a fake Darrow, he decides he has to find the real one and breaks free, to Denhem's ruin.  He falls from the success for which he had always dreamed and schemed to the man who unleashed a monster on New York.  After Kong and Darrow find each other there are some touching scenes of mutual affection that culminate in the classic scene atop the Empire State Building - a stylized version of it.  The biplane battle echoing one of the encounters on the island leads finally to Kong falling from his final mountaintop.The movie is a visual feast and tells this story with sincerity and conviction.  It offers up the substance the story has rather than sensationalizing it and I think that is a real treat.  I enjoyed it very much and recommend it to you.",King Kong

541625,"***SPOILERS***Finishing watching this for the 5th or 6th time today, I learned yet another piece to the puzzle of this movie which put it together in a way that blew me away as much as the first time I watched it.I can go in depth into the reviews and how good the movie is, but that's been done already to death.  I'll explain to you still confused how this movie works, starting from the true beginning- All the black-and-white scenes come before the movie... Leonard is already on his journey attempting to find John G. and being lead by Officer Gammell on the phone (Teddy).  He finally finds the ""John G."" guy, a drug dealer called Jimmy Grant, and kills him.  It's revealed now that Teddy has already helped Leonard find the killer of his wife the year before, but since then he has only been using Leonard's condition and his need for vengeance for his own shady means---he set up Jimmy the drug dealer by pretending to have $200,000 worth of methamphetamines for sale, and planning to steal the money for himself.- Leonard realizes Teddy's plan, and distracts Teddy by throwing his keys in a bush, then he decides that if Teddy is going to be making him chase around John G.'s or James G.'s as long as possible for his own benefit, he's going to chase his own John G.... Teddy himself.  So he writes himself clues about Teddy, by writing ""Don't believe his lies"" on the back of his photo, and tattooing his license plate number on his body.  Thus Leonard is plotting revenge again, but not against his wife's murderer as he thinks, but against the guy who's been using him to kill people.- Thus the color scenes begin (unveiled in reverse in the movie) in which Leonard is trying to follow the clues to John G.  Teddy (the John G. Leonard is after) is trying his hardest to throw Leonard off course, and to get him to give up.  He then encounters Natalie, and she finds out that Teddy was involved in her boyfriend (Jimmy Grant, the drug dealer)'s death, and attempts to use Leonard to try and kill Teddy.  She doesn't realize he is already attempting to ""find"" him and kill him, as he set himself on this course to begin with (before losing his memory at that moment)- There must be some sort of ability for Leonard to remember things and his memory distorts these things the way he thinks it.  The big clue to this is when he tells Teddy that ""memory can change the color of a car, it can change the shape of a room"" and concludes with the true beginning, when Teddy reveals to him that there IS no ""Sammy Jankis"" as he thinks... the character he's been talking about throughout the movie was a fraud, and had no wife, whereas the story of his disillusioned wife was actually Leonard's wife, and that Sammy was actually Leonard.Really this was truly a unique film, and spellbinding.  It's so complex, you can't watch it only once.  You learn something new with every viewing.And the film also has a very very dark, grim aspect about it.  Aside from the fact that he can never live a normal life again, he can't trust anything or anyone, and he doesn't even realize he's a murderer, and will never remember that it was he who set himself against Teddy after learning that Teddy had been using him for his own selfish purposes.",Memento VHS
352534,"Tous les Matins du Monde is one of those films you start off nodding approvingly: yes, this is going to be a good film. Yet as the film hits the 36-minute mark and Gerard Depardieu's narration still hasn't given way to the plot, you're not so sure. Alain Corneau is not short of ambition and nerve as a director, as his opening seven-minute close-up proves, but since abandoning the thriller genre for the arthouse he's no longer a natural storyteller or a particularly cinematic one for all the quality of the visuals. He's not helped here by not having much of a story to tell - the betrayal of violist Saint-Colombe by his pupil Marin Marais seems to exist largely for a final confrontation over the very nature of music that promises more than it delivers. Unfortunately, Jean-Pierre Marielle's excellent but appropriately one-note performance as the stern musician only able to really express his emotions through music tells us everything we need to know long before we reach that point.While the film is more illustrated lecture at times, the DVD is an altogether more successful affair - a fine letterboxed transfer and a strong selection of extras.",All the Mornings of the World Tous les matins du monde  VHS
916383,"I have to admit I watched this family film solely based on Roger Ebert's enthusiastic thumbs-up, and I'm glad I did. It made me immediately recall a film from my childhood, Alexander Mackendrick's 1963 ""A Boy Ten Feet Tall"" about a boy who travels the length of the African continent by himself after his parents are killed. The more obvious inspiration, however, is James Hill's 1966 ""Born Free"" about a lioness that needs to be returned to the wild. The fact that this 2005 film is directed by Carroll Ballard, who made the remarkable 1979 film, ""The Black Stallion"", ensures a level of craftsmanship rare in films these days. Thanks mainly to the sumptuous cinematography by Werner Maritz, this is a panoramic nature film of the highest order.The plot itself is small as befitting a family film. Based on a true story, it focuses on twelve year-old Xan, who has raised a cheetah named Duma on his family's South African farm since both were cubs. A tragedy forces Xan to take Duma out to the wild, where it belongs, without telling his mother. He makes it on a motorcycle to the middle of the Kalahari Desert where he runs out of gas and meets a suspicious wanderer named Ripkuna. Their adventures together make up the best parts of the film after a too-lengthy set-up in South Africa.  There are impressive scenes highlighting the rapport between Xan and Duma, and Ballard sets up some highly creative action sequences around the motorcycle's conversion into a wind-surfing vehicle, a collapsing mine tunnel, an overwhelming tsetse fly attack and a hair-raising whitewater raft trip amid hungry crocodiles.  It is the realism of these scenes that makes the film resonate more than a standard animal film.The acting is not the chief attraction here. However, Alexander Michaletos, who was apparently raised on a farm among cheetahs, plays Xan with natural &eacute;lan, and Eamonn Kelly brings the requisite mystery to Ripkuna. Sporting British accents, indie favorites Campbell Scott and Hope Davis have little more than cameos as Xan's parents. The 2006 DVD is light on extras - no commentary or making-of featurette (which could have been fascinating in this case); just the trailer and a couple of extended scenes are included. Still, this is a fine film to appreciate Ballard's too-rarely-seen cinematic artistry in conveying the delicate balance between humans and animals.",Duma
1033105,"This film was a wonderful display by a director at the height of his powers.  The nuanced performances, beautiful yet realistic sets, intriguing and thoughtful cinematography, and a powerful control over the pacing and the rhythm of the film were simply unforgettable.  I felt like watching the film again right after it finished.  At many times it reminded me of Kurosawa's ""Ran"" (another Shakespeare adaptation), especially by the chamber drama aspects present in ""The Banquet"".  It will not be everyone's cup of tea, to be sure, especially those who expect to see a martial arts film, which this is not; or those who expect a literal adaptation (or those possesed by semantics...)...but if you can enjoy a slower-paced film that takes its time building intricately nuanced characters and deep psychological studies, then this is the film for you.

213344,"This review is of the two disc special edition of Top Gun, not the prior one disc edition.  Top Gun is essentially about a naval pilot's journey through fighter weapons school.  He must resist his rebellious individual nature to become the best pilot and also a team player.  If you're reading this review, chances are you've already seen the movie so I'll focus on reviewing the dvd.This first disc is presented in widescreen anamorphic format which is a big upgrade from the original release.  The picture is generally sharp with good contrast.  Picture quality appeared to be a big upgrade from the prior release.  Not sure if this apparent upgrade is merely the result of changing to anamorphic transfer.  The soundtrack is presented in DTS6.1 or Dolby 5.1.  Sounds are generally well mixed and dialogue remains audible through out.  Be aware that the sound effects in the action scenes will be considerably louder than the volume levels of the dialogue.  With my 5.1 surround system, I found that the subwoofer got a workout, but that the rear channels were perhaps slightly under utilized.Extras were adequate.  On the second disc, there were some vintage interviews with the major players including Tom Cruise (pre-craziness).  These were interesting and there was some particular focus on the history of the film, i.e. getting it to produced.  The documentary ""Making of Top Gun"" was imformative.  In addition to the vintage stuff, there's also a restrospective look at the film.  Val Kilmer's appearance is notable.  Other lesser known actors also appear.  However, the interviews are notable for the absence of Kelly McGillis.  Also included is a picture gallery which is fine.All in all I'd say this is a good release for fans of the film.  The extras are excellent except for the absence of Kelly McGillis.  I view this as a significant absence since she is the the primary co-star.  4 out of 5.",N/A
1021079,"""The Wild Blue Yonder"" has taken an inordinately long time to finally make it to DVD. Although the cover boasts ""by the director of Grizzly Man"", Werner Herzog actually completed this film before his award winning documentary. This film highlights impressively Herzog's attitude to the documentary form. Although the narrative is pure science fiction fantasy (a fact Herzog over emphasises) almost every aspect of the film aside from Douriff's narration is documentary footage. Not only is it documentary, but it is also found footage, which is also case with ""Grizzly Man"". I'm in two minds whether this indicates a lack of creative imagination on Herzog's part (after all ""Wild Blue Yonder"" is a rehash of the original narrative of ""Fata Morgana"") or whether it shows Herzog's prophetic intelligence in using a variety of digital media to create his vision. The most impressive aspect is the underwater footage shot in the Antarctic, it truly is otherworldly and one could almost believe we are seeing another planet. The film does however get bogged down in a lot of mathematical nonsense in a number of sequences in which Herzog is clearly over indulging himself. Naturally this aids authenticity, but it is not particularly interesting. But the soundtrack which combines haunting Cello playing with Senegalese and Sardinian vocalists is mesmerising, evocative and also quietly disturbing as it provides the backdrop for mankind's limitations. The film has weaknesses, but this is Herzog so he can be forgiven for once again creating something totally strange, alien and unique.A big thank you must go to newcomers Subversive Cinema for releasing the film, the DVD itself also has some pretty fine extras, an indispensable commentary with Herzog and Douriff and some informative and entertaining documentaries and interviews. I look forward to more from Subversive Cinema, they could be a distributor of note.",The Wild Blue Yonder

However, Lola was by far my favorite character in the entire movie.In conclusion, it is what it is....and that is an action film in its most realistic looking unrealistic form.",N/A
277001,"Brilliant allegorical film about wealth, power, and commitment  in America. Judging from other reviews, the film does not appeal to everyone. That's understandable. The characters are almost uniformly dislikable, from the abusive Rich (John Heard), to the egotistical Alex (Jeff Bridges), to the self-pitying Mo (Lisa Eichorn), to the slimy George (Arthur Rosenburg)-- there is no one left to root for. At least not until later when the two crippled halves of Bridges and Heard finally unite, figuratively and literally, into one potent whole. Then we realize that it's toward this completion that the twists and turns of the movie have been moving all along. (I think this also explains why the Ann Dusenberry character drops out at a critical stage. She is no longer needed to get the two together.)Rarely has any film dared to create such an unsympathetic cast of personalities, especially Heard's Richard Cutter. If he has a single redeeming quality, I can't find it. His loud, grating voice annoys, piling on one sarcasm after another, oblivious to the hurt he causes. Like Mo he wallows in self-pity, and even shamelessly exploits his disability. Then too, his pursuit of the god-like J. J. Cord should appear noble, yet seems more the result of paranoid rage than a  desire for justice. In fact, Heard's explosion of anger on the Santa Monica pier is among the scariest, most convincing expressions of pent-up emotion that I've seen in many years of movie watching. Perhaps he can be charitably viewed as an avenging angel, in the manner of Lee Marvin in Point Blank. But that's a a stretch, since the Vietnam War has left him literally half-a-man, a berserk little top spinning around on alcohol and apoplexy, which, of course, is why he needs the able-bodied Alex to carry out his obsession.Yet Bridge's Alex Bone is an ultimate floater, getting by on boyish good-looks and charm. He has no concerns beyond himself, even seducing the vulnerable Mo, while husband Cutter is away. Apathy is his natural state. So trying to get him to act on the murder he's witnessed is like trying to push a big rock uphill. In fact, when he finally does blend with Cutter's rage and act, it's only because of Cord's arrogant 'sunglasses' gesture, and not because of a sudden steadfast commitment. In most films, it would be the handsome Bone riding the white charger and storming the heavens, having undergone a last minute conversion, and finally giving the audience someone to root for. Here, however, it's the wild spirit of Cutter who rides to the rescue, having at last gotten his legs back if only for a moment. Thus, contrary to expectations, the only concession to Bone is a compromised last minute one.There is, of course, a political subtext to all of this as one perceptive reviewer points out. Perhaps it's about how criminal wealth and power exist beyond the reach of ordinary folks, and how a commitment for change gets dispersed by escapism and a popular feeling of powerlessness, which can only be corrected by what appears a radical form of madness. But allegories aside, this is a bitter brew that does not go down easily. More than that, however, it remains a superb cult film whose provocative characters and perplexing imagery stay with you long after the screen has gone to black.",N/A
954480,"Roman Polanski has a talent that a minute number of directors in the world possess and that is to accurately translate a book to the big screen.  He did it with Rosemary's Baby in 1968, The Tenant in 1976, Tess in 1979 and now with Oliver Twist.While it may not be the ""definitive version"" of the Charles Dickens tale, Polanski pretty much spelled out 19th century London (and its countryside) that Dickens described in his book (to *great* detail).For those who have read the novel, you'll know that it's not a very cheery tale (which would explain the dreary look of many scenes).  Sure, little Oliver wins out in the end because of Mr. Brownlow's generosity and Nancy's being a mother figure to him, but what Oliver has to go through to win in the end is nothing short of tragic.  He was treated terribly in the orphanage, was put into an apprenticeship where he was a slave/punching bag, spent days walking to London, unknowingly gets caught up with a group of thieves (and is reluctant to be a criminal), finally finds someone willing to give him charity only to be kidnapped back into the gang.  As I read the book all I could think was, ""How many more obstacles is this poor kid going to have to face?  Give the poor thing a break already!""  I wanted to wrap my arms around little Oliver and tell him someone cared (before Mr. Brownlow came along).  Dickens used his experience in poorhouses for the storyline but boy did he stretch it!The only complaint I have (if you can call it that) is that the running time was too short.  Some details of the book were changed for celluloid and it's a shame because I really believe Roman would have spelled out those scenes beautifully.But he did a great job with what he had.  The costumes, the scenery, the dialogue, the cast (Barney Clark was the perfect Oliver and Nancy was portrayed even prettier than I had imagined) - the wait for this was well worth it ... and then some!Watching a Polanski film is quite the experience!  His is a vision no one will ever match.  - Donna Di Giacomo",N/A
233131,"I don't know why but I always got this ""the movie sucks"" feeling from everyone who watched the film. While of course the original is a comic book movie classic, it was also slightly strange in its pacing but understandable since it was the first film. The second picks up after the first one so it does feel like one big movie, with more better story and character moments and some really oddball things too.The romantic relationship/triangle between Clark, Superman and Lois Lane is reaching a new high, especially since Lois is having suspicions on his identity. Clark decides to give up his powers indefinately, only it's really bad timing as a nuclear explosion in space (Superman flew it up there rather than let it blow over Paris) breaks the Kryptonian warriors seen at the beginning of the first film, including General Zod. The film is part romantic comedy and slugfest as Clark has to deal with not only Lois but saving the Earth from 3 warriors as strong as he is.The film in a way seems better than the original: it's got better pacing with scenes that help the story and are interesting to watch, whereas for some reason I never liked the Smallville segment in the original. The effects, while still being not as polished, still look great for its time with even some new powers and one ridiculous one with the ""cellophane S"", parodied on Family Guy. The reference was funny, joke was not but anyway.One problem I always had with Lex Luthor in the original was that he never seemed to be that much of a threat, he was basically there to give Superman something to do and not feel outright menacing. General Zod on the other hand has that perfect menacing tone and looking downright cool while doing it (""Come, son of Jor-El, kneel before Zod!""). The girl warrior is quite easy on the eyes but the Frankenstein-esque warrior is just so funny it's sad.An obvious tie-in to the upcoming Bryan Singer directed film, the film will be re-released sometime around June with Superman director Richard Donner providing his own cut while also including this one. It's a good film anyways but I'm really curious as to how Richard Donner's version holds up.",N/A

291875,"Fritz Lang's imaginative, awe-inspiring and revolutionary epic is the stuff of legend. It is a film that has left a permanent imprint in the world of motion pictures and has been praised by many as one of the greatest films ever made. The production as a whole with its intricate sets, inventive costumes and state-of-the-art special effect (which were ahead of it's time) are still impressive today, 80 years later.The story offers a bleak interpretation of the future, a society divided in to two groups; the ""thinkers"" (the wealthy) and the ""workers"" (the exploited lower class). The workers live in underground dwellings underneath the glittering, modern, upper city of Metropolis where the wealthy reside and they work countless hours in order to maintain it and keep it operating. The workers leader, Maria, is their beacon of light. She is constantly preaching peace; love and understanding hoping that one day a ""mediator"" will rise among them and unite the two rivaling classes. Secretly watching Maria during one of her meetings is Freder Fredersen, the young, handsome son of Johhan Fredersen, the mastor of Metropolis. Freder falls deeply in love with Maria so Joh Fredersen orders Rotwang, an inventor who has just created a ""man machine"", to give the robot Maria's likeness. Joh Fredersen's plan is to set it loose among the workers and have them turn on her. Rotwang, however has other plans and decides to use the robot ""Maria"" to destroy Joh and Metropolis.Power, greed, corruption and slavery are the main focus here and are enhanced by the constant use of religious imagery throughout the film. Despite the films age, the complicated sets and backdrops are spectacular and beautiful to behold. From the sweeping views of the ultra-modern Metropolis with its imposing skyscrapers, endless stream of cars and airplanes which fly within city limits to the workers' smog-infested dwellings and the majestic work machines that run their lives to the thousands of extras who were carefully set and choreographed all contribute in giving ""Metropolis"" its trancelike quality.After 80 years of mistreatment and mutilation, Fritz Lang's extraordinary, expressionist masterpiece can finally be seen in a restored authorized edition that is crisp, clear, visually stimulating and with very minimal impurities present. It is surprising that they were able to ""clean up"" the film so well considering it's tumultuous history and the pain-staking restoration process but fans of fantasy, sci-fi and movie buffs in general should be thankful that ""Metropolis"" can now be seen with no blurred images and unsightly scratches. We are able to experience the overwhelming beauty of the mythical sets, the costumes and the surreal, dreamlike images that adorn this marvelous film like no other in recent memory.There are certain films that need to be viewed at least once and deserve to be in everyone's DVD collection no matter what one's personal taste in films is. ""Metropolis"" is one of those films. It's bizarre, splendid images of a futuristic society where half of the population is subjugated may be far-fetched (or is it?) but few can deny its utter impact, its grisly beauty, its haunting surrealism that has inspired countless of film makers to this very day and of course, Fritz Lang's undeniable creative genius. This film is a masterpiece of the highest order and one of the greatest silent expressionist motion pictures ever made. You will be doing yourself a disservice by denying its existence.Highly recommended and a ""must have"".",Metropolis Moroder version  VHS

Deader was a much worse film but got good reviews.  Maybe someone should pass me some of the crack their smoking but, Hellworld (aka not another teen movie) wasn't that bad.Considering the box was Digitally opened (metaphorically) It can be conceivable that they did step into hellworld.  Also with a great set, wonderful effects and no errors seen evident it stands on it's own much better than Deader.  I didn't think Bota could make me love Hellraiser again.  Although I love this in the sense I loved inferno.  This is more a tale of the box circulating and taking random victims and forming it's own urban legends around the world.  Still very much a story about 7 deadly sins and the angels or demons, however you see them.  Pinhead didn't use cheap lines used in pervious sequals and it was tastefully ended with a good twist.  Even let the real demons come in and finish off the story the right way.I can't understand hellraiser fans.  Maybe it's because the real fans stopped watching the films and gave up after part 3 and went to part 4 with hope but just gave up from there.

666270,"The Simpsons needs absolutely no introduction, and after 16 years on the air, it's pretty hard to talk about it in a review without heaping on the superlatives. Everybody in the world knows what The Simpsons is, and just how it has defined popular culture since its debut. Most critics agree that this is, by a large margin, the greatest TV series ever created. I'm not sure if I quite agree with this, but over time this may be the case. You have to understand that, even though I have been familiar with the show for as long as I can remember, it is only recently that I have taken a serious interest in it, which has culminated in the purhcase of The Complete First Season of The Simpsons on DVD.The Simpsons is great for a number of reasons. One of these is that it works on so many levels. The dumbest person in your family can appreciate it for its humour in the literal sense, but also the most intelligent person in your family can appreciate it for the use of irony, satire and various other comedic devices that make it such an intelligent programme. Creator Matt Groening said that with the first season on The Simpsons, he had no idea what he was doing. This may have been the case, but he was definitely doing something right. This season contains only 13 episodes which the FOX network commissioned with a budget of $10 million. This was a risk at the time back in late 1989, but it has since paid off; the profit FOX has made from this phenomenon is now estimated at inexcess of a cool $1 billion.The first episode of Season 1 is ""Simpsons Roasting On An Open Fire,"" which is a brilliant introduction to the family at Christmas. Homer failure as a department store Santa Claus, Bart's costly tatoo removal and a bad day at the dog track leave the family disheartened. Things look up when Homer brings home Santa's Little Helper and the family realise the true meaning of Christmas. ""Bart The Genius"" sees Bart switching I.Q. exams with Marten Prince, which results in a placement at a school for geniuses. His conscience soon gets the better of him, though, and Bart confesses all. ""Homer's Odyssey"" is a great episode where Citizen Homer is fired from his job and is caught in a web of nuclear hazards and public safety campaigns. ""There's No Disgrace Like Home"" is a true classic which sees Homer attempt to fix the major problems within his family after the realisation that his family is the worst in town. A visit to Dr. Marvin Monroe's facility is the hilarious high point.""Bart The General"" is an amazing episode which sees Bart form his own army to get back at Nelson, who beats him up after school for attempting to protect Lisa! In ""Moaning Lisa,"" we see Lisa slip into her childhood depression! How can she be happy with so much suffering in the world? She finds comfort in her saxaphone, and a chance encounter with bluesy be-bop 'Bleeding Gums' Murphy. In ""Call Of The Simpsons,"" the family take a trip into the woodland after Homer buys an RV in an attempt to compete with his annoying neighbour Ned Flanders. Of course, he crashes the RV over the edge of the cliff, which forces the family to survive in nature, amongst eagles, grizzly bears and Bigfoot! ""The Telltale Head"" sees Bart desperate to fit in with a bunch of rebellious teenagers that he is prepared to go to any lengths. This results in him cutting off the head of the local town's statue, Jebediah Springfield! ""Life On The Fast Lane"" is a great episode that sees Marge annoyed at Homer's lack of compassion towards her on her birthday. She turns to bowling in an attempt to try and make some use of the stupid bowling ball that Homer bought for her (or himself). She meets a man who tears her marriage apart - temporarily - before she is reunited with Homer.""Homer's Night Out"" is a classic in which Homer is caught on camera with an exotic dancer doing a bellydancer. Marge is unfuriated and forces Homer to teach Bart a lesson about women and their role as strong individuals in contemporary society. ""The Crepes Of Wrath"" sees Bart's bad behaviour reach fever pitch. In an attempt to control this, Principal Skinner sends Bart to France in exchange for an Albanian student. Bart leanrs how much his family means to him after his Hellish time. ""Krusty Gets Busted"" is a brilliant episode which sees the funny clown framed for robbery. The final episode of the season is the hilarious ""Some Enchanted Evening,"" which sees Homer desperate to impress Marge after she is dissatisfied by his treatment of her. They go for a romantic meal and hire a babysitter for the children. Little do they know that their children are in the deadly hands of the notorious Babysitter Bandit!This season sees the introduction of many well-loved characters, such as Marge's sisters, Patty and Selma, Ned Flanders and his diddly family, Montgomery Burns and his extremely heterosexual(!) sidekick Smithers, the legends that are Itchy and Scratchy, Grandpa Simpson, Reverend Lovejoy and his wife Helen, Krusty The Clown, Sideshow Bob and many others! This season also spawned many popular catchphrases such as ""Ay carumba!"" and the classic ""D'oh!""The hilarity of The Simpsons lies in its genius to turn traditional, Middle American values and flip them on their head. It shows America as the country it really is, without any sense of guilt or remorse, and because of this we love it. It is a bold, original, honest show that is totally one of a kind. Nothing like this will ever exist again, and the syndication of the show will literally run for decades and decades. We see ourselves in these characters because we are familiar with their ways of thinking. The Simpsons is so embedded in our public consciousness that I don't even have to go into as much detail about the characters of the show, it's premise or its creation as I would with any other show. All you need to know is that this DVD is essential, but be warned, once you buy this you've got at least another 17 to buy!",N/A
643863,"Those of you hoping for big laughs like scary movie 3 gave will be greatly disappointed, the gags are stale, the delivery of jokes is off and leslie neilson just isn't funny anymore. Some of the actual films scary movie 4 spoofs are the obvious War of the Worlds, Saw and the Grudge plus other films The Village, Brokeback Mountain and even Million Dollar Baby.  I think that Proft, Zucker and Abrahams dropped the ball there with the original idea that the Wayans brothers had to spoof just horror or thriller films. Even in Scary Movie Three they spoofed 8 Mile, The Matrix although funny, inconsistant with the original formula.  Some of the Dialogue was tired as well, especially when anna faris says she saw some Pictures of Bill Pullmans character in which he replies, 'I was young I needed the work' same dialogue used in the Naked gun between Priscilla Presley and Leslie Neilson.However the biggest jab in the film was at President Bush when leslie Neilson as the President learns that the world is under attack by aliens, he is seated in front of a grade school class and just sits there more concerned about the story being read aloud by one of the students.  Well done.  When I say some of the gags are stale they're really stale, Like Carmen Electra as the blind girl from the Village sitting on an open storage bench Going to the bathroom, with about twenty seconds of gratuitious Flatulance, done better in other films like Not another Teen Movie and Harold and Kumar go to WhiteCastle. Scary Movie 4 also seems to capitolize on  something they did in Scary Movie 3...accidental clumsy personal injury. People bumping their heads repeatedly in the same place. Various objects falling on people, People getting hit by cars and doors.  All that is repeated in SM4 and goes overboard.  This Movie does have some laughs, like the opening sequence with Shaquille O'neal and Dr. Phil...thats funny. But the rest of the film the laughs are few and far between.Anna Faris reprises her role as Cindy Campbell..always a pleasure. and Regina Hall is back as Brenda even though her character keeps dying in each film. I just hope this writing team doesn't have any plans for a fifth installment.Bottom Line.......Frankly I was bored with it, the laughs didn't come fast enough or at all. In fact most of the jokes were based on potty humor. I just watched the film through to see what else the would spoof. Dull, very dull.",N/A
641708,"""Good Night, and Good Luck"" is a brilliant period piece and re-enactment of a series of history-changing events.  George Clooney's direction is wise beyond his years, and the the cast is brilliant.  For all that intensity, however, the movie has just a little too much of Edward R. Murrow's famous ice-water in its veins, and when the last 10 minutes lag behind the setup of the first 80, there's an audible let-down.  While the movie is a can't miss in terms of films you ought to see, it manages to just miss film immortality by a narrow margin.The ensemble cast is led by David Straithairn, who's been turning in quietly great performances for years as less-than-noble characters in places like ""Dolores Claiborne"" and ""Eight Men Out"" and ""The Sopranos"".  His Murrow here is most assuredly not an imitation, not a case of an actor just reading somebody else's lines.  His job is to inflate Murrow's original words into something suitable for the big screen, without crossing the line over into melodrama or sounding like an actor playing the governor at Colonial Williamsburgh.  His ""off"" moments, when the TV cameras stop transmitting but director Clooney continues to show us Murrow in the darkened studio, are similarly filled with Strathairn's audible thoughts.The use of archival footage to portray McCarthy and Roy Cohn, juxtaposed against Strathairn's red-hot chilliness, keeps the events firmly grounded in reality, without a hammy actor playing McCarthy as a black hat, or some Harrison Ford type playing Murrow as the Patron Saint of Journalists.  Indeed, Murrow's lack of superpowers is shown when he's unable to save his doomed broadcaster friend, Don Hollenbeck, from the rantings of a right-wing media watchdog.Comedy is provided in a post-modern way, as Strathairn silently conveys Murrow's frustrations at having to ask Liberace, during the TV interview program ""Person to Person"", about why he's not yet taken a wife.  I saw this movie in a sold-out theater, and the laughter in this scene nearly drowned out the dialgoue.  Also funny is the presentation of an authentic '50s cigarette commercial -- indeed the whole movie is wreathed in smoke so thick that you'd think the visual effects team should get a Best Supporting Actor nod for outstanding portrayal of cigarette fumes.The rest of the cast is full of distinguished actors from film and TV... Robert Downey Jr., Jeff Daniels, Reed Diamond (late of ""Homicide""), Frank Langella (evidently playing Christopher Plummer), and even Alex Borstein of ""Family Guy"" (you can almost hear her whining ""Peeeter"" in her early scenes).  If there's a problem to the story, it's that the secondary characters, with the exception of Langella as a tormented William Paley, never generate much spark beyond the face- or name-recognition.  When the main story ends, the movie drags on for another 10 minutes wrapping up loose ends among the guest cast.  The end of the movie can't sustain the intensity of the first 80 minutes.The McCarthy/Murrow story remains an important one in today's world, in the same way that the retelling of the Salem witch trials echoed so meaningfully at the time of the original McCarthy hearings.  ""Good Night, and Good Luck"" is something more than just a History Channel documentary about old-time events, but at the same time it is on some level done in by its own narrative, as the story by definition cannot have a happy ending or a dramatic grand finale.

309268,"Chances are, if you're here, you've already made up your mind. People don't just stumble across a 1930s serial. So you're probably a fan of this kind of stuff.Which means we aren't going to judge this like we would a new, slick, Hollywood release with top-notch actors. This is budget sci-fi made for kids of the 1930s. It's not sophisticated, the acting is a little stilted, and the science laughable. But if you wanted that stuff, you'd buy something else, right?Comparing this to other serials, I think it's one of the best. Like all serials, it tends to bog down a bit after the first half. That's because most of the really new ideas get presented in the first chapters.However, the inventive approach to effects and matte painting are really enjoyable. The story is just silly fun.

There are dramatic situations, but not enough to pull heartstrings or keep you on the edge of your seat.  This is a normal slice of life character piece.  And that's it.  It's almost like watching the nanny-cam in your neighbor's house.  Not dull but just not that interesting either.",N/A

94326,"Disclosure tells the story of Tom Sanders who gets sexually harassed by his new boss, Meredith Johnson, his former lover. Now the thing about Disclosure that will keep you watching is not just the tension between those two characters. You will know who from the two is right, you will know who is wrong, but it are the people around them who are making it difficult: they don't know who did it which leads to nice thrilling situations.The casting of Disclosure is perfectly alright: Michael Douglas is perfectly cast as Tom Sanders and acts very good and believable. He shows us how a man in his situation feels very clearly and does that well-acted.Demi Moore is maqnificent as the bad guy, or I mean Bad girl in this motion picture. She acts on a certain way that will make you know how dangerous the woman is she is playing, which is superb.Even though Disclosure is not a Thriller with gunshooting, running and high speed pursuits, it fits perfectly allright next to those kind of Thrillers. Disclosure is at first a kind of sexual thriller with a highly erotic scene, but then goes to the level where it gets labeld a kind of office/court thriller. But don't worry, for the biggest part the film may take place in an office: it will put you at the end of your seat at some suspencefull moments.It is greatly shot, professionally made, well-directed and has performances that are perfectly alright. The story is written by and based on the novel by Michael Crichton. He knows how to write those kind of thrilling stories as we all know, but some things you just see coming in this film. That is too bad, but still, you have to expect some of the unexpected, cause that will be present to.Conclusion: Disclosure is a nice, well made, erotic and tensefull Thriller which also has some good dramatic moments. Recommended to Thriller fans, Demi Moore fans, Michael Douglas fans and to anyone else who wants to see a thriller where the situations get hot and out of hand.Like the tagline of the film says: sex is power. In this film you will see that indeed, with a nice thriller edge to it.",N/A

754876,"Frances McDormand (FARGO) is the big star in this tale of culture clash via generations. She portrays Jane, the tough, pot-smoking record-producing mother of conservative son, Sam, who just graduated as a shrink and now works with psychotics. Sam brings his girlfriend to stay at his mother's house. In a reversal of generational roles, Sam does not approve of his mother's lifestyle and history with multiple lovers. So, after a few days with mum, he decides to seek quarters elsewhere. Before they can escape his mother's digs, complications pop up and Sam's inexperienced girlfriend becomes seduced by the wilder goings-on surrounding Jane while Sam catches the eye of an attractive co-worker. LAUREL CANYON is basically an eventless movie and more a character study. Or perhaps an examination of artsy life in Laurel Canyon.

For a laid-back film experience put LAUREL CANYON in your pipe and smoke it.",Laurel Canyon VHS
197752,"The alternate title for the film Bolero (1984) is Bolero: An Adventure in Ecstasy...after watching the film last night a better one might have been Bolero:  An Adventure in Stupidity...written and directed by the late John Derek (Tarzan, the Ape Man), the film starred his most current wife at the time Bo Derek (10, Tarzan, the Ape Man).  Also appearing is George `Anything for a Buck' Kennedy (The Dirty Dozen, Cool Hand Luke), Andrea Occhipinti (Conquest), Ana Obreg&oacute;n (Monster Island), and Olivia d'Abo (Conan the Destroyer, ""The Wonder Years""), in one of her first roles.Bo Derek plays Ayre `Mac' MacGillivery, a woman who (get this) is preparing to graduate from an English college and once she does, she'll trade in her diploma for a vast inheritance.  Once that happens she plans to travel the world and learn the ways of love because, as you see, she's still a virgin.  Okay, wait a minute...Bo's pushing thirty and she's just graduating from college?  I can buy off on that, but I'm having a much harder time with the notion she's untouched, I mean seriously...anyway, after seeing one too many Valentino films (the film is supposed to be a period piece, set in the early 20th century I guess), Mac hits the road with her trusty chauffeur Cotton (Kennedy) and college friend Catalina aka `Cat' (Obreg&oacute;n), the trio heading towards the Middle East as Mac thinks it would be the ginchiest to get bagged by a real, honest to goodness sheik.  After a failed attempt (the sheik got stoned on magic smoke and passed out, but not before covering a nekkid Derek in warm honey), Mac, with entourage in tow, makes her way to Spain with the intent on hooking up with a handsome matador, and she finds one named Angel (Occhipinti), who, when not faux fighting bulls or shagging fourteen year old gypsy girls produces wine, and lots of it.  With the help of Angel's tagalong gypsy girl named Paloma, played by Ms. d'Abo sporting a ridiculous Spanish accent, Mac worms her way into Angel's bed after agreeing to use her vast fortunes to buy his wine, the deal sealed with a good shagging (I find Spanish business negotiations quite agreeable).  Following this there's some more idiocy, capped off by Angel getting his doodle gored by a bull, and now unable to perform, much to Mac's dismay (no more zoom zoom in the boom boom).  So anyway, while Cat's getting friendly with Mac's kilted Scottish lawyer and Cotton gets his groove on with Angel's sassy cook, Mac tries to draw Angel from his depressed funk in the hopes she'll be able to cure his condition by prancing around his room nekkid.  When not sadistically teasing a man who can't perform, Mac begins taking up bullfighting for some odd reason or another.Okay, I first saw this film back in the mid 1980s on cable I was in the hormonally charged state of a teenager coming into his own, so my main focus was obviously on Derek's nekkidness, of which there's quite a bit.  After watching this film again some twenty years later, I find I still enjoy the nekkidness, but I have to say the rest is probably one of the more ridiculous efforts I've seen in a long time.  I think the intent was to create a rich, erotic drama, but the film fails miserably mainly for the fact Bo Derek cannot act, at least not enough to carry a film.  She's certainly attractive, but her ditz factor is incredibly high, not helped any by her husband's completely rotten and moronic scripting (the film comes off like a poorly written Harlequin romance novel).  Speaking of her husband, how creepy is that, knowing he wrote and directed the film, especially given the sequences where his wife is getting it on with other guys (he filmed her in some equally steamy sequences in the 1981 moron-a-thon Tarzan, the Ape Man)?  The man was pushing sixty at the time (while Bo wasn't quite yet thirty), so the maybe wedding tackle didn't function the way it used to which resulted in his willingness to let his wife dally about on screen with other men (a couple of the intimate sequences looked pretty realistic)...I don't know, but whatever...a good part of the story has Bo's character talking about her virginity like it was some sort of gift she was willing to impart, which, after awhile, got really old (at least she didn't refer to it as her `flower, but she did refer to it as `her fruit' at one point), which ends, mercifully, after she gets her shag on with Angel.  As far as the rest of the cast they didn't fare much better.  George Kennedy seemed kind of lost, hanging about to pick up a check and see some nekkid broads I suppose, and Olivia d'Abo appeared simple-minded as the young gypsy girl stuck on Angel (eventually she gives way to Mac as she realized she couldn't compete).  One of the biggest mysteries for me, besides the actual point of the film, is why it ran an hour and forty-five minutes.  Once you get by the juicy stuff (the attractive people being a nekkid), the rest just drags under the unbearable weight of its' own harebrained idiocy.  Perhaps the funniest scene in the film comes near the end, as Mac and Angel are getting it on (seems Mac's desirability is such that it can cure a broken doodle) and they're transported to, get this, a smoke-filled plane of reality.  Right in the middle of their routine a large, purple neon sign appears behind them spelling out the word EXTASY, as if to really bring it home (yeah, I know it's spelled wrong but that's how it was in the film, intentionally so).  All in all if you're looking to see Ms. Derek in the raw, then this film is right up you alley as she's got about five or six scenes, but if you're looking for anything remotely resembling an actual movie (plot, interesting and engaging characters, etc.), best to keep on looking.The picture on this DVD, presented in widescreen (1.85:1), enhanced for 16X9 TVs, does looks clean and clear, and the Dolby Digital Stereo Surround audio comes through well.  As far as extras there isn't much except for a theatrical trailer and subtitles in English, French, and Spanish.Cookieman108By the way, did I mention how creepy (and skeevy) I found it for a man to write and direct a film featuring his really hot wife enjoying the pleasures of other men?

9295,"In 2005, we took a weekend trip from Baton Rouge, LA to Natchitoches, LA, where fifteen years earlier the filming of Steel Magnolias in 1989 remains about the biggest thing that ever happened. Having never seen the movie, we rented it as soon as we got back home. Everyone had a reason for watching it in two segments--mine was my sense that this was one of the ""cutest"" movies I'd ever seen, and I'd had quite enough ""cute"" lately, especially after sitting through Will Smith in ""Hitch"". The accents and the caricatures of the characters were all so thick that it reminded me of The Beverly Hillbillies, though more embarrassing than funny. One ""Hillbillies-like"" moment that pretty funny was the few non-female characters' effort to shoot some ""crows"" out of a tree so that they won't ""**** all over the reception"". Their creative use of a crossbow is a classic.Sad to say there isn't much else classic in a story that is at the same time saccharine and maudlin. There was also some choppiness between scenes (as the movie was adapted from a play that never left the beauty shop). I can think of two scenes in particular--one where the town-big wig Clairee (played by the noted-Southern belle Olympia Dukasis) buys the local radio station so that she can do the color commentary on the local football games (the scene features the same guy filmed bare from the back waist-and-lower view as he walks in front camera in the locker room three times.) In another scene, the Darryl Hannah (hard to recognize) committed Christian character argues with her boyfriend over his repeated taking of the Lord's name in vain. Neither scene has any impact on the rest of the story.Dolly Parton is her usual big hair, big smile, big **** self as the lead hairdresser. Shirley MacLaine has a very unsympathetic character as the Eatonton's (Julie and Sally, and family) ill-tempered neighbor. The male characters are more or less wasted, especially the estimable Sam Shepard, who spends most of the film underneath a car, or sitting lifelessly in front of a TV.The movie improved from the seemingly endless wedding prep and wedding of the first half to the second half, which became more dramatic. Sally Field has a pretty good scene near the end, she and the story make you think a little about the motives of the main character (Julia Roberts as Shelby).Overall, I thought that Steel Magnolias was a relatively embarrassing depiction of life in the beautiful town of Natchitoches, LA. Given that the locals seemed not to mind too much, I may be overreacting. They even showed us where the truck made an illegal left turn in the final scene.",Steel Magnolias VHS

173221,"Sci-fi has a bad rap, and one that it often deserves. A great many recent space operas have stepped way past the point where the setting overshadows the characters and the premise becomes alienating. Along with Firefly, the new Battlestar Galactica is one of the few shows this decade that has truly achieved this feat. The action blazes and the special effects are consistently impressive, as is par for the course among this set of shows. Yet the characters and plots are rich with real meaning, and the acting is well above average for TV - considerably less common in this genre. Battlestar Galactica's balance puts it well above the competition.There's no way to make the premise of Battlestar Galactica sound good on paper, but I'll do my best. The 12 colonies of humanity are destroyed in a nuclear attack by the robotic Cylons, who have created agents indistinguishable from humans. The lone military vessel that survives the attack is the aging Galactica, which leads a fleet of the few human survivors on a quest for the long-lost home of humanity, Earth. Of course, this was all in the schlocky 70s cheese-fest of the same name (except for the Cylon agents). The new Galactica adds a tension between the military leaders of the Galactica and the civilian leaders of the fleet and several other notable plot twists.Anyway, there's no point in trying to make the premise sound defensible. What really puts Battlestar Galactica atop the sci-fi heap is the acting and writing. Oscar-caliber actors fill out the two lead roles (Edward James Olmos & Mary McDonnell), and the supporting cast does an excellent job as well. Particularly impressive is James Callis as an unwilling pawn of the Cylons, whose turn toward madness is wonderfully realized. For their part, the writers do their very best to keep the show, despite its setting, down to earth. The characters are plainspoken and the plot tension never relies on made-up technology. Instead of technobabble, we get an intense and entertaining allegory of the dilemmas facing our world in the war on terror.This DVD box includes the original three-hour miniseries, which is probably the set's single greatest highlight. Other standout episodes include Bastille Day, Act of Contrition/You Can't Go Home Again, The Hand of God, and Colonial Day. Really, there's not a whole lot of fat on this season, or on the show at all. It's consistently gripping, entertaining, and challenging. Strongly recommended.",N/A

958139,"This is how a DVD box set should be done, and really you wish you'd see more cartoon DVD sets handled like this one.Teen Titans - The Complete First Season has the episodes  of season 1 (duh) and some nice extras, like interviews of the cast, looking at how the show was developed from the comics, stuff like that. There are even some extras that are hidden, like a Mad Mod music video sung by Hynden Walch (the actress who does the VA for starfire) and others asking the cast who their favorite villain or what their favorite gadget from the show is. The episodes are even in the order the show was supposed to air (before CN changed  the line-up a li'l) which actually works for the show.The menus are really easy to navigate through, and has a really nice blue tech-influenced style (for lack of better words.) Occasionally, the volume in the different segments like the extras will be lower or higher, which is a bit odd, but not so much that it's barely audible one segment and then blasting the next. Just a notch or two difference.If you're a fan of the TV series, you'll enjoy this set, and even if you haven't watched the series but are DC comic fans or just like super hero type shows, you'll enjoy this series.",Teen Titans: The Complete First Season
171123,"As Roger Ebert said in blurbing ""An Inconvenient Truth,"" - ""You owe it to yourself to see this film.""  I'd add that you owe it to future generations as well.Regarding the naysaying of the cause and effects of global warming, I'd recommend the book ""The Heat Is On"" by Ross Gelbspan.  Gelbspan has been dealing with the agents of big oil and king coal for years, and he exposes them quite effectively.Even if we were to put aside all concerns about potential catastrophes from global warming - the ecological damage that is caused by oil and coal extraction is heartbreaking.  Books like ""Resource Rebels: Native Challenges to Mining and Oil Corporations"" by Al Gedicks go into the details.  Then there is the issue of ""Peak Oil,"" covered by the DVD ""The End of Suburbia.""Finally, for some hopeful news, I'd suggest the DVD ""The Power of Community: How Cuba Survived Peak Oil.""Additionally, there are all sorts of alternatives being developed here in the US.  Denver just hosted 13,000 architects, interior designers, land use planners and others for the ""Green Build Expo"" (it will be held in LA next year).  They know that green construction is not only good for the environment, but it's also good for business.I hope Al Gore starts to emphasize the ways we can transition toward the next industrial revolution - the revolution that is outlined in books like ""Natural Capitalism"" by Paul Hawken.",N/A
920989,"PRIDE or PRIDE Fighting Championships is the largest mixed martial arts organization in the world. It is based in Japan and currently promoted by Dream Stage Entertainment (DSE). Its inaugural event was held at the Tokyo Dome on October 11, 1997, promoted by Kakutougi Revolution Spirits (KRS). It is the most popular MMA organization in the world based on the number of event attendees: the PRIDE Final Conflict 2003 event had over 67,000 people in the audience. The audience record is 91,107 people on the PRIDE and K-1 co-production Shockwave/Dynamite, held in August 2002. It is considered to be the premiere MMA organization on the planet.PRIDE Bushido is the branch of PRIDE FC that showcases the lighter weight fighters.  Since its inception, early Bushido shows were often criticized by the Japanese media for not having enough action.  In my opinion, Bushido 4 was the turning point that placed Bushido on the path to becoming the hottest event in Mixed Martial Arts today.Unlike many MMA fight events, you get a ton of bang for your buck.  There are 10 fights on the original PPV fight card with an 11th bonus fight in the Extra Features section of the DVD.  Here is a spoiler-free breakdown of the fights:Luiz Buscape vs Hiroyuki Abe - 7/10Dokonjonosuke Mishima vs Marcus Aurelio - 9/10- a tremendous fight between two top Lightweight fighters.Amar Suloev vs Dean Lister - 4/10- What looked like a decent match on paper, turns out to be a terrible snoozefest.Hayato Sakurai vs Brady Fink - 6/10- A pretty large mismatch as the legendary Hayato ""Mach"" Sakurai takes on an upstart American in Brady Fink.  Sakurai's original opponent Crosley Gracie, was forced to withdraw due to injury.Ikuhisa Minowa vs Kenichi Yamamoto - 7/10- Minowa is a characterTakashi Sugiura vs Giant Silva - 7/10- Interesting to watch because of the sideshow factor.  The 7'4, 400lbs Giant Silva makes his PRIDE and MMA debut against a much smaller Japanese opponent.Mirko Filipovic vs Shungo Oyama - 8/10- Cro Cop makes a huge impact as he returns to the ring after being upset in his previous bout.Paulo Filho vs Akira Shoji - 8/10- Very good back-and-forth fight with both men gaining the advantage on momentary occasions.Takanori Gomi vs Fabio Mello - 9/10- A tremendous fight between ""The Fireball Kid"" Takanori Gomi and BTT fighter Fabio Mello.  Gomi shows why he's one of the most dynamic and entertaining fighters in the world.Antonio Rogerio Nogueira vs Kazuhiro Nakamura - 7/10- After an entertaining tilt in their first fight, Rogerio and Nakamura lock up again in the rematch.  A good fight.With the its reduced price, I highly recommend Bushido 4 for any Mixed Martial Arts fan.  Their are a few boring fights and some snooze worthy moments, but overall its a pretty high class event.",N/A

1009174,"This was a Christmas gift from Santa to my son (7 mos) and myself this year and we've reviewed it a few times and so far it has been educational for both of us. This video exposes infants to basic first moves such has, sitting up, crawling, reaching, etc and to toddlers to basic movements such has, walking and kicking. There are plenty of delightful puppet shows either demonstrating the movement or just to provide something to catch the attention of the viewer (since babies typically have short attention spans...well at least my son does). This particular video features a lot of baby clips with babies aged from 6mos-24mos demonstrating the movements at age appropriateness. My son isn't one for mimicking, so far as I can tell, but it does hold his attention fairly well and he does best when I watch it and do the featured movements with him. There are language features for this video allowing you to watch it in English, Spanish, and French which has been great for us since I speak broken spanish and so far my son does recognize such words as comida (food) and sientate (sit) so in one hand it is a reinforcer for him and a teaching tool for myself as I had forgotten many of the verbs used in reference to baby movement such as camina (walk). Also, in the bonus features there is a short clip with a pilates instructor directed towards mothers to teach us busy women how to get some excercise and playtime in with our children, for this reason alone I would recommend it...it is, however, only like 10 minutes long and only gives you about 10 tips but those 10 tips to someone like myself can be a lifesaver (I didn't know how to properly pick up a carrier with a baby in it before I saw this!).

He's able to convince a has-been actress Helen Sinclair, played by Wiest in her Oscar winning role, and a distinguished English actor Warner who has a huge appetite, played by Broadbent. The only way that David will be able to have his play hit broadway is if he allows a gangster's lover Olive, played by Tilly, who proves to be a terrible actress. Just when David thinks things are going bad, Olive's gangster bodyguard Cheech, played hysterically by Palminteri, interferes with David's script and demands to make changes, while Warner and Olive begin a secret affair.The film's comedic approach and Woody Allen's brilliant directing and screenplay makes Bullets Over Broadway a splendid film, and one of the best comedies of the past 15 years.RecommendedA",Bullets Over Broadway VHS

544898,"It was interesting to watch this film after having watched the later ""Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas"" so many times. Released in 1980, this features a Bill Murray who was many years from transforming himself from SNL alumnus and goofy comedy star into Oscar-nominated elder statesman. This is only a year removed from ""Meatballs,"" for heaven's sake, yet it was clearly a sign of things to come. Murray's assured performance as gonzo journalist Hunter S. Thompson can stand right alongside Johnny Depp's more crazed portrayal. The film as a whole is a bit more human than ""Fear and Loathing,"" especially in Peter Boyle's interpretation of Carl Laszlo as a cause junkie (as opposed to Benecio Del Toro's interpretation of Laszlo as simply a junkie, and a criminally insane one, at that).

102488,"An ambitious and superbly acted film, _Splendor in the Grass_ showcases the young Natalie Wood and Warren Beatty in his first screen role. Supporting actors also hold up their end with distinction. The film explores large and universal themes -- the thwarting of young love by parents who fail to understand the depth of their children's passions, the fragility of sanity and even of life itself in the face of the first great disappointments, the tendency for mistakes to repeat themselves over generations and for parents to project their own experiences onto their children. In the end, it is indeed a moving exploration of these and other similar themes.It also must be said, though, that the film doesn't really transcend its specific historical moment the way that truly great works of art sometimes can. It has a polemic specific to its time and place (1961 America), namely that sexual repression is a really bad thing and that it leads to some mighty peculiar and self-destructive behavior.Warren Beatty does an impressive job of portraying a young man impatient for his first sexual experience and frustrated by love, but all that doesn't seem really to be the point. Skulking behind the scenes is the message that this high school in Kansas ought to have instituted a sex-ed class (or at least that the timid Dr. Smiley ought to have done a better job of advising young Bud that his feelings are normal!).Truly, we are not on the Great Plains of Kansas in 1929, but in Hollywood of the nascent 60s. Even an inattentive viewer can just feel the sexual revolution lurking around the corner of this film. Salvation lies in the Freudian ministrations of the sanitarium where the tender Deanie learns to understand herself and her family.In short, though set in the late 1920s, the movie is a period piece about the late 50's, early 60s. At some points, in fact, it is so campily dated that one wants to laugh out loud. Such urges (even when unhealthily repressed) do detract somewhat from the experience of watching this movie in 2006.",N/A
972863,"Teddy Pendergrass was one of the last great voices in R&B before the genre went belly up in the eighties. Teddy delivered both suave and gritty Soul in an era when disco and radio formats started to reign. His performances were at the same time highly erotic and uninhibited macho. With his mighty and gruff pipes he blew away the competition but could be very tender as well. Teddy is best known for his silky albums but was a mean live performer to boot. So naturally any live DVD should be welcomed. But as with many DVD releases of classic Soul artists this release just doesn't suffice. Although I wouldn't want to argue about the quality of the material that is there, which is exhilarating, it just isn't enough. This release features only eight songs and very little interesting bonus material. I guess we'll have to do with this very meager release. But I keep hoping for a DVD that does Teddy justice.",N/A

737386,"Halfway through Assignment: Outer Space, I thought this Italian effort had to be the worst, most boring science fiction movie I had ever seen in my life.  Then a funny thing happened - the story suddenly became interesting, a couple of the characters actually acquired something resembling a personality, and I actually had to begin rooting for the annoying reporter character who made the first forty-five minutes such an insufferably painful experience.  I'm not going to declare the movie good, but neither am I going to declare it bad.  It is interesting in its own peculiar ways, and - though I hate to admit it - I actually enjoyed it.Here's the basic story.  Roy Peterson (Rick Van Nutter) plays an annoying reporter sent into deep space for a story on the guys manning the space stations.  None of the astronauts want him there, especially the station commander - and that's even before they learn first-hand just what a pain in the patootie he really is.  Peterson's behavior doesn't help, as he's a know-it-all who doesn't believe in asking permission to do whatever he wants to do.  When the base commander receives urgent orders to travel to Mars, Peterson uses his connections to get himself invited along.  He doesn't know that it is a secret mission to save the Earth from a rogue space station rushing toward it; radiating incredible heat for a radius of 5,000 miles, it will turn the Earth into a blob of boiling mud once it goes into orbit.  Good old Earth looks like it's down for the count on this one.  It's going to take a miracle to get out of this jam, as all the bravery and heroics in the world can't seem to penetrate the heat shield and stop the tin can of death from its fateful rendezvous with the Earth.You don't see a lot of Italian science fiction films from the 1960s.  Assignment: Outer Space was, in fact, one of the pioneering efforts.  The brainchild of Antonio Margheriti, this 1960 film was shot and completed (and that includes the special effects) in a mere 20 days for less than $30,000.  The color of this film is so faded that I spent most of its 73 minutes trying to figure out whether or not I was actually watching a black and white print.  The special effects may be laughable today, but some (certainly not all) of them really weren't bad at all for their time (1960).  The explosion shots are pretty weak, the Mars scenes are best left forgotten (it's amazing how a moon can sneak up on you when you're not paying attention), but at least some thought went into many of the spaceship/space station shots (featuring vehicle separations, landings, spacewalks, and even a deep space refueling).  Here's a tidbit of trivia I found fascinating: knowing that viewers would undoubtedly look for the wires above the models, Margheriti attached wires to the bottoms of his models and filmed everything upside down.  Brilliant!",N/A
860056,"This movie is fantastic. Completely smart, very scary, beautifully shot. Gorgeous on every level. It's the kind of movie I wish I hadn't seen, so I could see it again for the first time.

And when it was over, we watched *all* the bonus features, including a ten minute thing on, like, EDITING it or something. We haven't responded to a movie like this since... maybe _Sleepy Hollow_.It got *awful* reviews.I think that when the movie came out (I didn't notice, I had a new baby) there was a lot of hype surrounding the plot twists. Kind of like Sixth Sense, where there's this huge thing at the end. So people were too focused on that, and analyzed the whole movie through that filter. We were fortunate enough NOT to know that, or read any reviews, or hear any hype before watching it. Yah, there are twists. But who cares? If you haven't seen it, don't think about any of the media surrounding it, if you can. Just watch it, and don't anticipate anything while you watch. I know, that's impossible.

754938,"I was really taken off-guard by this energetic and original movie!When we ""meet the meat,"" as Lyz Kingsley would say, the two guys actually have personalities and become characters with at least some depth.  As per usual, the girls get shortchanged in this category.  And then we meet the crazy Spaulding family.  Even though they're psychos, each of them gets at least some degree of personality and character as well.  As a result, ""House of 1000 Corpses"" is much more interesting than the run-of-the-mill horror film.  You may think you know where this movie is going once you're 30 minutes into it, but trust me, you don't, and I'm not going to ruin the ending for you.There are some funny, funny moments in the movie, which come directly out of the characters.  Refreshingly, the horror and the comedy don't get mixed.  Zombie pulls no punches in the horror department, and doesn't cheat by cutting away in the conventional places.  The Spauldings don't issue cheap one-liners after some mayhem.  The juxtaposition of short moments of horror between other scenes having different tones keeps you off balance and makes the horror more effective.As for the DVD itself, it is loaded with special features, and has the funniest menus you will ever see.  Each menu features a different character talking to (or berating) you, the viewer.  When you first insert the disc, Captain Spaulding will abuse you for minutes on end.  And it's funny!

633678,"The words ""suburban family dramady"" sends up red flares in my personal taste for movies.  As a rule, movies dealing solely with a single, suburban household and the various ins and outs, overblown turmoil and melodrama that innevitably surrounds them, almost always fall short of their mark.  Not only are most of these films boring, but in an attempt to build them up to something remotely interesting or meaningful, they're filled with melodramatic subplots involving the kinds of things that seem particularly devastating to suburban families - but hardly anyone else.  In short, it's hard to find a good quality about most of the films in this vein.  ""Imaginary Heroes"" however pulls a one-two punch to the gut, and manages to strike a certain chord, using realism as a strong right-jab, and strong character development as its follow-up left hook.  The single most impressive element of this movie, however, that if for no other reason, makes it worth watching, is the chemistry between Emile Hirsch and Sigourney Weaver, who play mother and son in the film.  For romance films, actors who play lovers occasionally stumble across a counterpart whom they have genuine chemistry, and more often than not, can forge a certain feeling for a person strong enough to carry the film.  This is not a romance movie, nor do these actors play lovers.  These two seemed to have genuinely stumbled upon a rare bond, at least as far as the screen can show.  They genuinely connect in a mother/son sort of way, with an uncanny bond and affection for one another.  Mother's close with their sons - suburban or otherwise - will validate that there is a certain element of unspoken connection between one another.  This is genuinely displayed in this movie, not in a forced kind of way, nor an obvious ploy, but as a real element of the actor's relationship.  Whether this holds true outside the film reel or not, it's enough to penetrate the viewer's initial skepticism and build a powerful involvement with the characters and their outcome.Criticisms have been hurled at this movie.  ""Too many subplots.""  ""Melodramatic elements abound.""  Etc... etc...  I have to say, this is exactly the kind of thing that initially warned me away from this movie - not because I'd heard bad things about the film, but because I hold these criticisms true for every movie along similar plotlines.  I have to say though, ""Imaginary Heroes"" works beautifully, achieiving a sense of art both in movement, and as an end product.  The script is eloquent but real, which is in fact where most of the movie draws its realism from.  Despite what ""Entertainment Weekly"" has to say, ""Imaginary Heroes"" is a movie strongly routed in realism, and powerfully so.  The characters here are real portrayals of real people.  Perhaps a tad to one extreme or the other at times, but they are never overdone nor overplayed.  To those who are worried that too much is tackled in this film - let's look at it objectively.  I won't argue with people who say a lot happens, because it sure does.  It's an onslaught of tension and tragedy, one after the other, but honestly, in the wake of a serious tragedy in any family, in any walk of life, everything that may have been loose at the seams, begins to fall apart.  Bad things often spawn from bad things, because when people fail to cope, they turn to destruction, of self or otherwise, and cause increasing turmoil.  This is beautifully and truthfully exemplified in this film, and manifested superbly in the actors portrayal of their respective characters.  The movie strikes close to home, no matter where you're from, and uses powerful character development and inter-character connections, put to the test and built stronger to hit home with the viewer.  An overlooked film, lost in the gray area between art-film reviewers (looking for something more extreme or artsy,) and the mainstream critics (looking for something glossier or more flambuoyant,) ""Imaginary Heroes,"" it's eloquent characters and poignant story seems doomed not to be truly recognized, but lends it an unusual power: it makes it a rare gem, a diamond in the rough, and gives it an uncanny personal impact with the viewer, similar to the aftermath of an intimate one-on-one conversation.",N/A

Get it more publicity and out of the ""closet"" so everyone can enjoy it. Fantastic scenery, excellent casting, wonderful soundtrack, and a storyline as beautiful as it is controversial makes Brokeback Mountain a classic before its time. Ang Lee did it again. The story is about deep love and devotion (who cares if it is between 2 men?) and how no obstacle can stand in the way of it. You soon forget that the two people in love are same sex and concentrate on the aspect that even though forbidden, they manage to endure obstacles that prevent them from being together permanently from living in different states, loveless marriages, nagging in-laws, money, and the fear of being ""found out.""

Yes, men do cry at films; there is nothing wrong with that. I say if you can cry at a film, then the director made his point and the actors earned their keep. The love scenes between the two men were very tastefully done and not shock value for the sake of selling tickets -- it again reiterated the story line of pent up emotions that finally erupted and were long overdue. Heath and Jake were perfectly matched in their roles. I was so moved I bought the soundtrack, the book, and am waiting for the DVD to be released to ad to my collection.

1011578,"You can't copyright a title.  Therefore, it occasionally happens that two movies with the same title appear that are unassociated with each other.  Such is the case with The Covenant, which came out twice in around a year, both times as horror movies.  I can't comment on the latter release (having not seen it), but my guess based on watching the earlier Covenant is that version two is probably the better of the two.  It would be hard to be worse.This first movie stars Edward Furlong as David Goodman (he's essentially a good man, get it?), a political public relations guy who is gifted at his job and has an inexplicably devoted hot blonde wife.  I say inexplicable, because even early in the movie, he comes off as weaselly and banal, hardly one to attact such a woman, let alone have her head-over-heel in love with him.  Ah, well, love is blind, and soon he is also, the victim of a criminal act.Fortunately, he is offered a chance at getting his sight restored by Michael Madsen, a villainous sort who gives David a demonic cane that restores his vision and also turns him evil (or rather, feeds on David's naturally evil tendencies).  This leads to murders and other crimes, while David's wife investigates the origin of the cane.  All of which leads to a climax that is silly and derivative.Done correctly, this could have been a good movie, but instead, we get a bunch of standard movie cliches.  When a car catches fire, it, of course, explodes with that strange triple blast that only happens in bad movies.  When the wife is told by a professor that he has discovered important information and ""Come see me"" (because apparently he is incapable of saying any more over the phone), of course, he is dead by the next scene.Beyond the cliches, the writing itself is dumb from the very start:  in the prologue, we see Madsen's character retrieve a cane that is being held in a church.  Despite the obvious dangers of the artifact, it is only guarded by an ancient priest and isn't even hidden.  The rest of the plot is riddled with idiocies, but it is wrong to criticize the movie merely based on the plot.  The direction and dialogue are equally bad (and the effects are barely passable and display the low budget this film clearly has), but probably the biggest failing is Furlong himself, who cannot even begin to carry the picture;  he has neither the presence nor talent.Clearly, if you make it through this movie, you'll realize it is really just a cheap rip-off of The Devil's Advocate.  Keanu Reeves may never win best actor, but he is light years ahead of Furlong in his ability to star in a movie.  Similarly, Charlize Theron is easily superior to her counterpart (whose name I have already forgotten) in this movie, and Michael Madsen is not close to Al Pacino in his ability to ham it up.  So if you want to see The Covenant done right, see The Devil's Advocate instead.  Or if you want to see The Devil's Advocate (or horror movies in general) done wrong, watch this film.",N/A

Clocking in at 84 minutes(with credits), this is the definitive Halloween docu that every one has been waiting for. It traces the series' history and it's legacy.

494141,"It is easy to understand why they changed everything but the bare premise of this movie for the 1984 remake.  After all, the 1948 original staggered beneath the weight of massive burdens.  Its star performer not only consented but actually seemed to delight in delivering precisely articulated dialogue in long blocks, one after another--and all at crackling pace, too.  Worse, Preston Sturges' clever, witty script plainly assumed that his audience possessed both general knowledge and willingness to pay attention for whole minutes at a time.  Worst, Sturges' plot satirized both movie stereotypes and audience expectations.Those 1948 audiences, for good and sufficient reasons of their own, did not turn out in droves nor did they shell out much money to see ""Unfaithfully Yours.""  The 1984 production team did their very best to avoid that dismal fate by jettisoning Sturges' near-perfect script, ruthlessly dumbing everything down and shrinking the film to fit the talents of twinkly little Dudley Moore.(Rex Harrison to Dudley Moore, what a falling off was there!)Harrison plays British conductor, Sir Alfred de Carter, whom the script clearly expects the audience to identify with the real conductor, Sir Thomas Beecham.  The initial satirical thrust at  audience expectations is that de Carter turns out to be a super-egotistical prima donna rather than the smooth, lovable and--yes!--twinkly Sir Thomas.  By a series of satisfactorily ridiculous plot developments, Sir Alfred becomes convinced that his beautiful and much younger wife is having an affair with his assistant.Sir Alfred has a high comedy encounter with a detective played by Edgar Kennedy, one of the finest second bananas in movie history.  The detective does his level best to convince the wronged husband to ignore or forgive his wife's little failings, lest he lose far more than he can ever hope to gain from shallow, trifling revenge.  In the course of the scene it becomes clear that the detective had not taken his own advice in the past and now bitterly regrets it.  This is a wonderful scene, and probably Kennedy's last hurrah on the screen, for he died shortly thereafter--a perfect mixture of hilarity and wistfulness.The egotist brushes aside the warnings of the detective and transforms himself into Othello's younger brother.  Before, he had been over-generous and almost too-eloquent for belief with his loving words; now, he sneers and derides.  If he does not quite get around to demanding that his bewildered wife hand over a handkerchief, it is only because time is short and he has a concert to conduct.The performance begins with an overture by Rossini.  The up-tempo music puts the conductor into a manic mood and his mind turns to a plot in which he murders his wife and casts damning suspicion on his rival.  The elaborate machinations of the murder scheme satirize whole flocks of creakily overblown films from ""The Bat"" to ""Philo Vance and the Kennel Murders.""  The second selection is the music of the pilgrims from Wagner's Tannhaeuser--a downer after Rossini.  The conductor's imagination shifts from murderous revenge to world-weary forgiveness as it satirizes the emetic nobility of films such as the often-remade ""Four Feathers.""  Finally, a Tschaikovsky piece  moves Sir Alfred's thoughts to grim competitiveness.  He will challenge his younger rival to a game of Russian roulette with his wife as a reluctant witness--think of about half the films made by John Barrymore or Doug Fairbanks, Jr.After the concert, the conductor rushes off to his home to prepare for his elaborate murder scheme, only to come hilariously crashing against the harsh reality of ruthlessly hostile mechanisms, cheerily incomprehensible operating instructions and painfully fragile chairs.In the end, the conductor's wife offers an explanation that allows him to dismiss all his suspicions and return to his original state of (illusionary?) wedded bliss.With brilliant performances, crackling dialogue, smart plotting and fine physical gags, ""Unfaithfully Yours"" ranks with ""The Ladykillers,"" ""Kind Hearts and Coronets"" and ""Monsieur Verdoux,"" the best of black comedies.Five stars.IDLE SPECULATIONS: Good as it is--and it is very good--""Unfaithfully Yours"" might have been better still.Rex Harrison, however brilliant he may be in the dialogue scenes, is not by any stretch of the imagination a physical comedian.  Even though screen credit is given to a conducting coach, Harrison is painfully stiff as a conductor and as often as not behind the beat of the music he is supposed to be conducting.  And the physical comedy sequence is weakened by the obvious substitution of a stunt double from time to time--not to mention the obvious fact that Harrison's record player is far funnier than he is.  In 1948 there was an actor of the right age, one who who could have gotten away with the conductor's dialogue and would unquestionably have been side-splittingly funny while conducting or going two falls out of three with the demon record player--Charlie Chaplin.  Now THAT would have been something to see!Then there is the script.  The film ends on a subtly false note.  As ""Unfaithfuly Yours"" stands now, Linda Darnell's innocent wife neatly explains away every suspicion; she leaves not only her own virtue unblemished but also that of her unpleasant younger sister who throughout the film had been positioned as the eventual fall girl.  At the very end of the film, the fully reconciled conductor and wife turn away to depart for a happy evening on the town.I think that the studio or even Sturges, himself, cut a final  scene to conform to the nervous dictates of the Film Code.  I think that as the happy couple and their friends leave the hotel, they were intended to pass by Edgar Kennedy, the detective who had striven so hard to preserve the de Carter marriage.  I think that Darnell and Kennedy were intended to make eye contact in shared acknowledgment that the pack of lies they had concocted to reassure Sir Alfred had worked.  Then, at last, the conductor's straying wife would indeed have been Unfaithfully His.",Unfaithfully Yours VHS
831452,"'Close Your Eyes' is a stylish, suspenseful thriller which will keep you on the edge of your seat until the final riveting scene.  What may be most effective about the film is the gradual build-up of suspense, transforming a standard serial murder mystery and smoothly propelling it into a highly original supernatural shocker.Goran Visnjic is Dr. Michael Strother, a hypnotist specializing in helping smokers kick the habit.  When detective Janet Losey, played by Shirely Henderson visits for a session, she discovers the doctor's gifts go well beyond putting people in a trance.  As the mystery deepens, Losey enlists Dr. Strother in her investigation of a serial killer plaguing London.  Strother resists at first, then realizes he might be the only one to solve a crime which may free him of trauma which has tortured him for years.Some nice extras are included on the disc, including interviews with cast and crew and a behind the scenes look at the making of the movie.  Horror and mystery fans alike have much to savor in this handsomely produced spooky outing.",N/A

596181,"Throughout the last 30 years director Steven Spielberg has delivered blockbuster film after blockbuster film, with very few stinkers along the way.  His successful efforts are numerous, some even garnering Academy Awards in varying fields, he's managed to launch many actors and actresses from Hollywood's B-list straight to the top of the A-list, and also launched many of Tinseltown's most lucrative film franchises.  From ""Close Encounters of the Third Kind"" to ""E.T.:  The Extra-Terrestrial"", from ""Jaws"" to the `Indiana Jones' trilogy, all the way up to ""Jurassic Park"" and ""The Lost World:  Jurassic Park"", Spielberg is a movie-making force to be reckoned with.  With all of these hits under his belt, every once in a while he still suffers the occasional clunker, such as 2001's very expensive ""A.I.:  Artificial Intelligence"".  Audiences were disappointed with this film, and some wondered if Spielberg really had what it takes from a director to craft a successful futuristic sci-fi thriller.  In response to the public's doubts, Spielberg returned to the realm of sci-fi in 2003 with the smash-hit ""Minority Report"", successfully laying to rest any doubts and fears movie audiences may have had regarding the veteran director's talents.""Minority Report"" takes place in the not-so distant future in Washington D.C., where for 6 years has been completely murder free thanks in no small part to an awesome technology that identifies a killer before the crime is committed.  However, when the chief of the Precrime Unit (Tom Cruise) comes under investigation for a future murder that will occur within 36 hours, he has to fight against time and his co-workers, led by an over-zealous investigator (Colin Farrell), to prove his innocence or fall victim to the seemingly ""perfect"" justice system he helped to create.With outstanding special effects (rumored at first, to have been taken directly from ""A.I.:  Artificial Intelligence"", the rumor was later debunked), gripping performances from the entire cast, and once again excellent direction from a critically acclaimed director, it's not surprising that ""Minority Report"" enjoyed great success at the box office and on DVD.  Roger Ebert summed up the movie best when he said, ""It reminds us why we go to the movies in the first place.""  I couldn't agree more with Hollywood's portly movie critic, ""Minority Report"" is one of those few science fiction movies that not only entertains with outstanding special effects, but the story actually makes you ponder certain ideas and notions; such as, is someone truly guilty of a crime they have yet to commit or is there a chance that maybe they intended to commit a crime, but may have not gone through with it, therefore making them innocent?  If that's the case wouldn't arresting that person on intent alone be unjust or merely stopping the inevitable evil that will occur at some point in that person's future life?  Who knows, but it sure makes one think, which is what all movies should aspire to, and what all good movies actually accomplish.This is definitely not a movie to be missed, and should definitely be watched by any sci-fi fan, and if you are a fan of Steven Spielberg but was somewhat disappointed by ""A.I.:  Artificial Intelligence"", then ""Minority Report"" is the movie to see, as it will help you to completely forget about that previous failure of Spielberg's.""Minority Report"" is rated PG-13 for violence and brief language.",N/A

212623,"While maybe not as good as the Wrath of Khan, this story offers a great conclusion to this two part story. The only let down of this film is that Leonard Nimoy as Spock isn't seen until the very end of the film, which may discourage some fans that they didn't get enough of the Spock they know. But, the story makes up for any loss of the film and the age progression of Spock actually makes the story even more intersting.This film also marks the debut of Leonard Nimoy directing a Star Trek movie, and he is makes a great director. The most bizarre thing about this movie is that it features Christopher Lloyd as a Klingon. As funny as it may seem and even appear when watching for the first time, he actually made a pretty intersting and convincing Klingon and enemy. There is a lot of drama that takes place in this movie as well as another known character is tragically killed. Overall, another great installment in the Trek movie franchise.",N/A

154637,"On its surface Lillian Hellman's play THE LITTLE FOXES (1941) seems to be about a wealthy family destroyed by greed in the Deep South of 1900.  Matriarch Regina Giddens (Bette Davis at her icy best) presides over a family with a crippled husband (Herbert Marshall) and assorted morally weak and greedy relatives.  Repeating their stage roles are Patricia Collinge, Dan Duryea, Charles Dingle, Carl Benton Reid, and John Marriott, according to Leonard Maltin.  Making their film debuts are Collinge, Duryea, Reid, and Teresa Wright.  Fans of movie trivia should remember that Collinge and Wright played mother and daughter in Hitchcock's SHADOW OF A DOUBT (1942).  Collinge plays the weak Birdie here, while Wright is the hope for the future as Regina's daughter.  It has a bitter and bitchy family at odds with one another.  There is a cotton mill the family owns in town.  Since it is prosperous, there are fights over ownership of it.  And when a lot of bonds are taken from a safety deposit box in the town bank by family members, Regina wants them returned--or else the equivalent amount of money given to her in cash.  As for husband Marshall, Regina stays with him for his money.  This is gripping and superbly played drama.  It is a complicated family drama, and I hope any errors on my part in terms of relationships are not serious and can be ignored.Actually, THE LITTLE FOXES seems to me to not be about plot at all, but rather is an exercise in Hollywood Golden Age style.  It is fabulously crafted by some of the greatest talents the movies have ever seen---producer Samuel Goldwyn, director William Wyler, writer Hellman, and star Davis in one of her greatest roles.  Gregg Toland did the elegant deep-focus B&W; photography (such beautiful antique lamps!) the same year he shot CITIZEN KANE.  Art director Stephen Goosson won an Oscar for Capra's LOST HORIZON (1937).  Costume designer Orry-Kelly won an Oscar for Wilder's SOME LIKE IT HOT (1959), with considerable credits in between.  Editor Daniel Mandell won an Oscar for THE BEST YEARS OF OUR LIVES (1946).  The background score is by THE MUSIC MAN's Meredith Willson.  And the cast is world-class, if not household names.  This is such an exquisite movie to look at visually, to study the period re-creation carriages and wallpaper, to marvel at the old-fashioned vested suits, to listen to Hellman's dialogue.  And moments of silence.  Watch the chilling scene where Regina's foreground face is frozen in a chair while crippled husband Marshall tries to climb a blurry background staircase to get some medicine.So THE LITTLE FOXES is a feast of a drama for discriminating audiences, and Bette Davis admirers in particular.  Samuel Goldwyn also deserves a lot of credit.  He didn't produce a lot of movies during the 1930's and 1940's, but each one seems hand-crafted and outstanding now, including THE PRIDE OF THE YANKEES (1942) and THE BEST YEARS OF OUR LIVES (1946).  William Wyler had previously worked with  Davis on JEZEBEL (1938) and THE LETTER (1940); Davis won an Oscar for the former and a nomination for the latter.  And Wyler directed Teresa Wright to an Oscar the following year, 1942, with Best Picture Oscar winner MRS. MINIVER.  And Hellman's dialogue is cutting sharp and her characters treacherous.  THE LITTLE FOXES is an extraordinary movie made by truly extraordinary talents on both sides of the camera.  It is really a must-see and may even be a masterpiece, if it catches you in the right mood.",N/A

724801,"Whether this 1997 ABC television movie version was entirely faithful to Stephen King's original novel is almost irrelevant.  The film is doomed from the start for two reasons; the minor being that when you have the now-classic 1980 Stanley Kubrick/Jack Nicholson version (faithful or not!) looming in the shadows like a parasite, you can't possibly expect to come close.  The major reason being, simply put, it wasn't scary; not even a little bit.If you're making a Stephen King TV movie out of a Stephen King book that's supposed to be scary, and it ISN'T, then it's project over!  Not that it can't be done on TV, though.  IT and THE STAND were effectively frightening in all the right places.

321593,"A Midnight Clear (Keith Gordon, 2002)Keith Gordon will probably be best remembered for playing Arnie Cunningham in John Carpenter's so-so film version of Stephen King's so-so novel Christine. Gordon, however, hung up the acting togs in the late eighties and went behind the camera, and it is here he has truly shined, turning out such brilliant movies as Waking the Dead and television genius on such series as House, Dexter, and Homicide: Life on the Street. The man has an amazing track record. So it's with some confusion that I regard those works where Gordon comes off as being somewhat less accomplished. A Midnight Clear is one of them.Based on a novel by William Wharton, A Midnight Clear is the story of a World War II platoon (full of misfits, natch) who are ordered to scout out a mansion inside enemy territory. They encounter the enemy-- but not an enemy they expect. The survivors of a German platoon are in a house down the hill looking to surrender. The two groups spend a companionable Christmas together before they turn to the task of deciding how to get each other out of the situation they've found themselves in-- enemies in wartime becoming friends.This is not your typical war film; characterization is much more important than action here, and as in many other substandard war films of this stripe (Hart's War and Tigerland immediately come to mind), it almost seems as if the director wanted to still play it as an action film. There's not enough real character development here to float the entire movie; we get to know our main character well enough, and the character upon whom the entire plot will turn later. We get a little less on the guy who's here for the purpose of building sympathy. On the rest of the platoon, very little, and on the enemy, nothing. We know more about the back-line lieutenant-- a minor character at best-- than we do about the Germans.Not up to the standards set by either Gordon or Wharton. **",A Midnight Clear VHS
924367,"One thing about Arrested Development that I forgot to mention in my previous review is how the humor holds up nicely over the years.  What I found funny last year when I was watching the show is JUST as consistently funny now.  In fact, now that I understand the style of humor better, I think the show is even funnier now.Fox had something good cooking with Arrested Development.  It seems whenever a show doesn't get the ratings a network wants, a network will move the show to another night and timeslot in the hope of achieving better ratings.  It VERY rarely works, and sadly Arrested Development is another example of this.I can't blame Fox for pulling the plug.  After all, they tried their hardest to promote the show.  I remember Sunday nights watching the Simpsons and during the commercials the people at Fox REALLY wanted viewers to tune in.  The writers of the show should be proud that Fox tried very hard to keep it on the air.  It's just unfortunate people didn't want to watch it.  I still believe if more people were willing to pay attention to the characters on the show and made a solid effort to get involved in the twisted storylines instead of assuming the show should be like a regular laugh track comedy, Arrested Development would be around today.As it stands, 53 episodes are all we have of this great show.  Honestly, it's not enough, but will have to do.Do we really NEED anymore laugh track comedies?  Aren't there more than enough of them on the air now?  Most of these shows people won't even recognize when they hear the name of them because there's so many.  Most comedies that feature a laughing audience are exactly the same, and they blend together.  One plainly obvious joke after another.  I'm bored just thinking about it.  We've reached a time when television has changed with all sorts of reality shows and whatnot, and changing the format of the comedy genre to a direction similar to Arrested Development is the right move, in my opinion.  The times need to change.People make a big deal about Arrested Development because there's really NOTHING else like it on television.  That's why the show deserves all the 5-star ratings it has received here on amazon.  People wouldn't be praising the show so much if there wasn't a good reason for it.  Trust me, there's a reason for all the positive reviews.  Buy one of the DVD season sets, pop a bag of popcorn in the microwave, watch the show *carefully* and experience the joy so many people are raving about.",Arrested Development: Season 2
169188,"Rob Marshall`s ""Memoirs Of A Geisha"" doesn't have an ounce of gray in it. There's black, and white, bold, blood red, deep aqua blue and sunlight river gold. But no subtlety, no nuance. Wall-to-wall melodrama, it opens on a stormy night and closes on a blooming lagoon. It's a prestige picture succeeding in escapism and the enjoyment of watching catty, beautiful women prance around in thousand-dollar costumes.Geisha houses were popular in Japan for centuries through the 1950s; they still operate, I suppose, in their own way as escort services, though girls are no longer sold into the profession in elementary school and then trained for ten years before their virginity is sold to the highest-bidding client. It's formal prostitution, though Marshall and Co. would like us to think the long, long (long) smoldering affair between Sayuri (Ziyi Zhang) and ""The Chairman"" (Ken Watanabe) is a kind of forbidden love.For years it doesn't seem Sayuri, born with sky blue eyes, will be anything more than janitor of her house, so manipulated she is by the house's best-earning geisha Hatsumomo (GongLi, excellent) a jealous vamp skilled in flirt and theft. Hatsumomo sizes up her much-younger housemate and decides Sayuri's friend, the clumsy Pumpkin (Youki Kudoh) will be easier to control.It isn't until a classier geisha named Mameha (Michelle Yeoh) recognizes Sayuri's beauty and potential talent that Sayuri is allowed to go to school, learn the art of sexual insinuation and eventually debut in a light-and-sound performance suitable for a high-class strip joint.  Through these formative years she must duel with Hatsumomo until the inevitable showdown, when House Mother (Kaori Momoi) must choose heir house heir and the vamp discovers the wunderkind's crush on The Chairman, who once treated Sayuri to a sno-cone.Does it sound trite? Oh, it's a soap opera.  But ""Memoirs Of A Geisha"" with its top-shelf production values, presents one visual flourish after another. Zhang and Yeoh, sensing larger access to Hollywood, deliver sincere performances. And there's a great villain in Gong Li, who at 40 must play a 22-year-old - and sneers and snorts her way to stealing the movie.But Hatsumomo exits the movie two-thirds of the way through and the movie must shift to Sayuri's trials through the end of World War II, the destruction of Japan, and eventual rebuilding, when the Chairman requests her service for a few American generals to help secure an industrial contract. Sayuri returns to her old station and finds her friend Pumpkin part of the arrangement, and different than Sayuri remembered.Maybe Marshall (""Chicago"") has directed the best movie he could about  geishas; maybe that's why Steven Spielberg dropped out to make the equally controversial, but far more substantive ""Munich."" Marshall certainly made the most commercial movie he could have, and DVD viewers - especially women in that ""Oprah"" season of life - may be surprised that a movie so smacked around by critics is also compulsively watchable. It's pure confection, sweet, empty, guilty, filled to the gut musical up swell and dramatic closeups. I doubt all this flies too close to mundane, emotionally cloaked lifestyle of a real geisha, and it doesn't completely succeed as a romantic picture because the love story engine peters out. Watanabe's character is so distant and vanilla that his relationship with Sayuri, whatever the resolution, lacks even an implicit passion to it. We're left to enjoy the catty duel between Hatsumomo and Sayuri in the movie's middle as Edith Wharton meets Quentin Tarantino.",N/A

973459,"I was basically shocked as all heck when I saw a trailer for this movie on TV over the holidays. Given the modest success of the first film, I was surprised they were going for a sequel. I was even more shocked that the bigger stars like Hilary Duff and Tom Welling returned for this, but somehow the timing was good enough for all fourteen original characters to reprise their roles.After seeing ""Cheaper by the Dozen 2"" quite a few times in the theater this Christmas, I have to say that it was very nicely done and certainly outdid the 2003 film.It's not anything that's going to win an Oscar or be discussed in passing years from now, but then again it wasn't trying to be either of those things. It was released as a clean, lighthearted movie, ideal for a day at the movies with the kids over the holiday break from school, and I thoroughly enjoyed every minute of it.Don't get me wrong, I watched the first ""Cheaper by the Dozen"" in 2003 and liked it well enough. But right off the bat, the one element of this sequel that sets it gloriously apart from the original, and that's the general attitude of the Baker children. Remember how bratty they were three years ago, treating their parents like dirt, treating one another like dirt, and pulling juvenile pranks left and right? Well, now they're a little older, they get along with each other, and they're actually nice to their parents. It makes for a much more relaxing and enjoyable viewing experience with less children screaming and acting up.The premise for this sequel finds Tom and Kate (played perfectly, once again, by Steve Martin and Bonnie Hunt) finding that with their three oldest children stepping out of the nest and the remaining nine becoming more involved in their own activities, it would be a good idea to get the whole family together for one last summer at the lake house. Sounds good....that is, until we meet Jimmy Murtaugh (played quite nicely by Eugene Levy), who has a large family of his own and is determined to strike up another heated competition with his longtime rival Tom Baker.As I said before, the Baker kids are much more likable this time around, and each are presented differently in the film. First off we have:Nora, who is now married (not to Ashton Kutcher, haha) and pregnant with her first child. Perabo does a nice job here; she and her husband are funny and sweet to watch together, and Perabo contributes to a very heartwarming final scene at the end of the movie.Charlie, a college student working to pay off loans and trying hard to please his parents, all while attempting to figure out his ""next move"" in life. ""Smallville"" star Tom Welling puts forth a good and modest performance, just as he did in the first film.Lorraine, whose graduation opens the film and introduces her plan to pursue an internship in New York in the fall. The return of the infamous Hilary Duff is probably the most surprising part of the movie, but it was nice that she came back for this and helped get the sequel made. Her number of scenes are small and spread out, and she seems a bit bored most of the time, but Lorraine has a few nice interactions with younger sister Sarah that help demonstrate Duff's ability to get into character, an especially notable feat with such a large cast.Henry, Jake, Mark and Mike, the four middle sons, who aren't given much to do in this movie except a few lines here and there.Sarah, the third-oldest preteen daughter seeking her own independence and developing her first crush on none other than one of Jimmy Murtaugh's sons. Roger Ebert said it, a myriad of other big-time movie reviewers have said it, and I'm not going to deny it: Young actress Alyson Stoner delivers what is arguably the movie's most heartfelt and well-done performance in this role. The scene where she goes out on her first date literally brings tears to my eyes every time I watch it, and even though the storyline about a tomboy plunging head-first into adolescence and finding her very first crush is nothing new, it is still something that practically every woman can relate to. It's a somewhat cliched character analysis, yes, but Stoner plays it so sweetly and with such youthful innocence, she absolutely makes the entire movie. This actress really comes into her own with this role, and I genuinely hope to see more from her in the future.Twin daughters Jessica and Kim, too, don't have much of a personal storyline to play off of, but actresses Liliana Mumy and Morgan York do well enough with what they are given. The only thing I'd have to say about them is that the writers clearly tried way too hard to give them witty lines and funny things to say in unison (e.g. ""Lay off, Dad!"" and ""We agree to participate!"") and in the end it didn't quite work. The little girls playing the parts are cute, though, especially the red-headed Liliana Mumy. She's another one with a distinctively expressive personality and cute face that could land her roles in other movies.The two youngest Baker kids, identical twins Kyle and Nigel, probably stand right behind Alyson Stoner as the next best thing about the movie. Those are the same adorable faces you see on the television series ""Desperate Housewives,"" and even though they don't have much to do in this film either, they melt your heart whenever they come onto the screen.Steve Martin and Bonnie Hunt do a terrific job in their scenes, as well; both of them seem custom-made for the roles as nurturing parents, and they work very well together as on-screen husband and wife. With all the chaotic events going on with the kids, the two of them portray a very special lesson for viewers with the amazing love that they still have for one another. Eugene Levy and Carmen Electra round out the main cast, both playing their roles with humor and ease, and all in all this is a nice movie that handles its overwhelming cast much better this time around. The 12 kids were basically a train wreck in the first movie, running around and getting into all sorts of trouble, but now they are more fleshed out and established in the plot.  It is funny, appealing, and yes, even touching, all while outdoing the original 2003 film and remaining more than ideal for parents to enjoy with their children.",N/A

If you really like Martians, then this is the movie for you. I like the fact that it took Slim Whitman to kill the Martians. They just can't take his music! My favorite part about the Martians was that they were super clever. Just look at those gigantic brains! Not only were the Martians super smart, they were also extremely sly. I don't know why we kept falling for the same old trick over and over again. I guess it was because we wanted to believe they were good, but of course that was not true. We didn't know that until it was too late. That was one of my favorite parts about the Martians. They kept on giving us the business and anyway, the movie really stood out! I could imagine the Martians before I had even seen the movie. At the beginning, we could just break the Martians' helmets with a simple gunshot. At the end, they really knew how to protect themselves.They were real villians. Well, you know what they say: you can't last forever! I wonder if there really are Martians out there. Don't you?",N/A

973679,"Anatole Litvak's engaging WWII drama ""Decision Before Dawn"" examines the war from an entirely different perspective.  Filmed in the war ravaged remains of Nazi Germany in 1950, the story commences as American troops are poised to cross the Rhine and enter Germany.  In the waning days of the war an American intelligence detail lead by Col. Devlin played by Gary Merrill and Lt. Rennick played by Richard Basehart are using captured POW's to act as spys.  Using specially trained and suitable German soldiers they hope to gain sensitive information to aid in the war effort.  Oskar Werner playing Cpl. Karl Maurer is just such a man.Werner, an educated son of a physician, and not a loyal Nazi supporter, is a medic in the German Luftwaffe.  He and Basehart along with another Nazi traitor code named Tiger and played by Hans Christian Blech are dropped behind enemy lines to determine the location of crack Panzer units.What makes the film so unique, was that Werner's odyssey through the dying Third Reich gives us insight into the disposition of the German populace.  Their downtrodden existence scrounging out an existence in the final months of the war is a disturbing sight to behold.Litvack's film is a tribute to the nameless German spys who aided the Allied war effort.",N/A
221500,"IN A NUTSHELL: THE STORY OF THE FINAL DEMISE OF HITLER & HIS EMPIRE""Hitler: Last 10 Days"", featuring Alec Guinness in the lead as Adolf Hitler, is an historicially-significant although flawed attempt to recapture the essence of the final disposition of Hilter and his Third Reich.Alec Guinness plays Adolf Hitler as a suffering introvert motivated by a combination of maniac antagonistic intensity and withdrawn somber resignation. Guinness portrays Hitler with strongly-emotional, often-histrionic displays of both sorrow and contempt toward the German people, almost simultaneously. This is very well done in that Guinness does reveal the broken and tortured mind of the former proud leader of the great German Reich. In essence, Germany's external destruction seems to be going on internally with what is left of Hitler's presence of mind.WHAT IT IS ALL ABOUT: WORST TRAVEL DESTINATION OF APRIL 1945 - CENTRAL BERLINFrom its set, which was almost entirely inside Hitler's Berlin bunker, 'Hitler: Last 10 Days' attempts to narrate a kind of historic journal for posterity to depict the dying days of Hitler and his Third Reich as the Russian army comes ever closer to his underground lair in central Berlin.In this dark underground setting, Hitler is portrayed as a broken leader attached to a sorrowful band of followers whose former imperial swagger has literally turned into a sort of collective drunken stagger. Hitler, it seems, is the only sober one in the bunker, but he has obviously found his escape within his collapsing sanity. The film utilizes a series of vignettes that are strung together to make this immense subject with dozens of players fit into a feature-length film, in English, for a general, moviegoing audience. Obviously this limits the scope of the project. Here are some examples of the scenes:Hitler summons the new head of the defunct Luftwaffe [Eric Porter as Gen. Von Greim] to Berlin to be promoted to Field Marshall, only to have what was left of the Luftwaffe destroyed trying to escort the new Field Marshall to Berlin for the meeting and tea. Of course, Hitler's tailor made Von Greim a Field Marshall's uniform with which for him to return to his empty post. Of course, this tale is essentially true and is included in other books and films about this epic historic moment. The sense of proportion is the only thing I would question here as other chronicles of this event seem to give the 'Luftwaffe Debacle' relatively little importance in the grand scheme of the last days. It does, however, demonstrate that the once-sharp mind of the leader of the Third Reich was not functioning rationally.Another scene, which also shows up in other films and literature, is what happens when Hitler finds out that there was NO COUNTER-OFFENSIVE, which was to have been led by Steiner, against the Soviet forces. In this scene, we can see most clearly the flaws in the film, whereby certain literary licenses are taken for the sake of dramatization during Hitler's 'public/private' reaction to this ""betrayal"" by the General Staff. It is very well done by Guinness as Hitler, but it is a bit theatrical, even for Adolf Hitler. The film 'Downfall' depicts the scene rather poignantly and probably closer to what really happened. To be specific, in the film, Hitler portrayed by Guinness promised to have the chiefs of the German General staff 'Drawn and Quartered' and to have them 'Drowned in their own blood', and much more, while in a closed-door session that everyone could hear despite the cataclysmic cacophony that was always in the bunker's background.Lastly, the scene depicting Hitler having an argument that compelled Eva Braun to take poison during Hitler's final madman-monologue while he was cursing at her is a bit too much. The coup de grace shortly followed as Hitler, staring at Eva's suddenly lifeless body shouts, ""YOU HAVE BETRAYED ME"" before shooting himself.BOTTOM LINE: NOT A PERFECT FILM BUT WHAT ELSE WAS THERE IN 1973 ON THE SUBJECTThough this was made to be as accurate as possible, time and careful analysis has shown that some of what we see in this film is somewhat fictionalized, but the bulk of what is depicted is shown rather well. One must bear in mind that this film was released in 1973 when accurate depictions of the end of Hitler and the Third Reich were only known to scholars and prosecutors. The rest of us were given ""The 3 Stooges,"" ""Charlie Chaplin,"" and ""The Marx Brothers"" to come to terms with Hitler and his cartoonish cronies which served to further deepen the myth of Hitler the Caricature. Only with the more recent releases of groundbreaking films such as ""Downfall"" and ""Inside the Third Reich"" do we clearly see this film's shortcomings. In other words, ""Hitler: Last 10 Days"" was, at the time of its release, a rather revolutionary film and was the first of several better films and books that followed. For all the aforementioned reasons this is a film worth watching, but it is best to be somewhat familiar with the subject before viewing.",Hitler: The Last Ten Days 1973  VHS
946604,"""The Great Raid"" is a film so standard in concept and so lifeless in execution that it can be frustrating at times to watch. It is a bad movie not because it has tried to achieve something and has failed, but because it has tried to achieve so very little in the first place. Stock characters, hackneyed dialogue, and poor direction are not the ingredients of a good war film. War films need not be completely original and inventive to be worth watching, but if of a formulaic approach, they need to at least be exciting and well made to be successful. ""The Great Raid"" succeeds in very little other than boring its viewers. It is a typical war film of the worst kind, with no passion in its storytelling and with an execution so dull it may as well have been titled ""War Film #483.""The film is about a daring raid to free American POWs in Japanese controlled territory in the South Pacific during World War II. The battle is turning heavily in the favour of the Americans, but the fleeing enemy forces have taken to executing their remaining POWs, and a group of highly trained Americans are sent in to rescue a camp of 500. The opening to the film is very effective, with war footage and narration used to establish the story and set a historic and tense tone to the film. The first scenes of Japanese cruelty to American prisoners are also good and are perhaps the most emotionally effective scenes of the film. From there, however, it becomes clear that the film will be nothing more than one long lead up to the `great raid.' This could be effective, but the attempts to create sympathy for the characters that will fight and fall in the raid are so heavy-handed and clich&eacute;d that all effect is lost. As a result of this poor character development, by the time the rather anti-climactic finale occurs it seems of little concern who lives and who dies.One of the main problems with the film is the acting. It is poor at best. James Franco and Benjamin Bratt are ripe examples of why most television actors should stick to television. Their performances are so dull and their dialogue so forced, I could not have cared less about the characters they portray. Actors, I feel, should be able to convincingly deliver more than one emotion, a level of talent these two actors fail to achieve. The only notable actor in the film, Joseph Fiennes, is given a character so ill throughout the entire film that his performance ends up about as sickly as the others. The poorly written, clich&eacute; ridden screenplay is of no help, but these actors fail to do anything remotely interesting or watchable with the characters they are given.The story may be a great one, but this dull film fails to do it justice. The film is not without some worthwhile cinematography and an occasional watchable scene, but by the time the predictable loose-end-tying text comes up at the end of the film, I could not help but be thankful.",N/A
954450,"Before I could begin my review for ""Family Portraits: A Trilogy of America,"" I had to do some online research to get an idea of what other film critics thought of it. Naturally, I found almost nothing in terms of professional reviews; the best I had to work with was the reaction of John Q. Public on DVD websites (this one included). They were interesting reviews to say the least; it seemed that the most unanimous opinion was that it's a disturbing yet powerful film, something that had to be watched for the sake of originality and style. That's why I had to see what other people thought of it before I said anything: even though I liked it, I had absolutely no idea why. Maybe getting a general idea of why other people liked it would help me find the reason.A compilation of three previously made short films from writer/director Douglas Buck, ""Family Portraits"" is in a lot of ways like an adult oriented, much less campy, and much darker version of ""A Series of Unfortunate Events"" by Lemony Snicket. Every character is moody, troubled, and depressed, and their circumstances go from bad to worse in a relatively short period of time. It pretty much destroys the possibility of hope, happiness, and redemption, which, I suppose, can be seen as realistic and thus effective (if you think like an incurable pessimist, that is). But that's where the similarities to Snicket's book ends; even he wouldn't think up something that delves into the aftermath of a severe mental breakdown, depicted in ""Family Portraits"" with some of the sickest, most perverted acts of violence ever captured on film.The plot is actually a combination of three distinctly separate stories, all of which focus on one character and their decent into heartbreak, madness, and in some cases, murder. The first story is called ""Cutting Moments,"" a bleak expose that, frankly, has no redeeming qualities. It opens with a man named Patrick (Gary Betsworth) trimming his hedges. Right away we see that he's completely detached from the world; looking him in the eye would be as meaningless as looking at someone on a television screen. He then forces himself to speak pleasantly (unsuccessfully) with his young son (Jared Barsky), who's just as detached as his father is.And then we meet Sarah (Nicca Ray), the wife and mother. You've probably already guessed that she's detached as well, and at that point, I began to ask myself what she and Patrick saw in each other in the first place. The emotional tension in this segment is thick right from the get go (just as it is in the other two segments); everyone walks on eggshells, taking long pauses between sentences to find just the right words. What exactly is wrong, here? There are hints of a divorce and their son's removal from the home, but it's never clearly explained. Because of that, the rest of the piece was too shocking for me to comprehend.Apparently, Sarah fits the recently coined Desperate Housewife profile, struggling with the torment of feeling unattractive and unloved. She makes one last attempt at a moment of happiness with her husband by dressing in a flattering red dress and putting on lipstick. His complete failure to notice her sends her over the edge ultimately leading to one of the most disgusting scenes of self-mutilation I've ever seen. I'll spare you the details, although I will say this much: Patrick certainly notices her then. And something is awakened within him, something much darker. By the time you get to the final shots of them in bed, you'll understand what I mean.The next story, entitled ""Home,"" is a bit more tolerable, but only to the smallest degree. Gary Betsworth returns as a character (also named Gary) that attempts to understand why he feels the way he feels about his life, his family, and his faith. His voiceover narration weaves in and out of the segment as he goes on a disturbing journey of self-discovery, a journey that leads to memories of his own childhood. His father (Ray Bland) was particularly troubling: yes, he was a distant, unfeeling man, but that was only by day. By night, he was an even darker person, as seen when the young Gary (Ronald Baldino) spies on his parents after hearing his father ramble words of domination and belittlement.Gary's relationship with his parents instilled a fanatical sense of religious piety; a few key shots show him (both as a child and as an adult) punishing himself by repeatedly whipping his left forearm. Exactly why is a mystery, but whatever the reason, it plays a big part of his current life with his wife (Christine Caleo) and daughter. He says repeatedly that he wanted to have the security of family. He also says that he tried to be a good father; at one point, he asks his daughter if she thinks of him while he's at work. It's clear that he's in a terrible rut, going so far as to deny his wife sex (who timidly proclaims ""I have needs,"" even though she knows she's supposed to be ""proper""). At first, I was led to believe that he wanted to make things better for himself and his family. I was wrong: yes, he does want to make things better, but the method he decides on is not what I was expecting. Believe me when I say that it's a deplorable, inhuman method, something that anyone with even a shred of decency wouldn't even think of.The last story is the most compelling one, and while it's just as melancholy, it at least attempts to show that even in the most terrible of circumstances, salvation may be waiting for those who deserve it (but that may be a stretch). It's called ""Prologue,"" and it tells of Billy (Sally Conway), a teenage girl returning home after a year of rehabilitation. She had apparently been in some kind of accident, one that left her paralyzed and missing both her arms (in their place are a pair of fabricated metal claws).Weaving through the segment is the plight of an elderly couple that is still reeling over the disappearance of their daughter (which supposedly happened many, many years ago). Like everyone else in this movie, they exhibit the most downtrodden of personalities, one being completely unresponsive to the other (mostly due to the wealth of hidden secrets). We initially don't know what the situation is, and interestingly enough, neither do some of the characters. But the details gradually show themselves, almost as if the audience is slowly being given puzzle pieces that fit into a large, complex jigsaw picture. And by the time the dark, deadly connection between the couple and Billy is revealed, the audience will finally come to understand that human nature is sometimes filled with some pretty ugly stuff, stuff that should never be let out into the open.So I go back to my original point: why did I like ""Family Portraits""? Maybe it's because--despite the repulsive gore, the wallowing characters, and the inescapable despair--it does follow a kind of twisted logic, one that centers on the reality of grief. This isn't to say that the film takes a moral stance against it; if that was the intention, the filmmakers certainly chose a funny way to get their point across. No, I think they were trying to say something else; specifically, that grief exists, period. It's a simple truth, but it's a truth nonetheless, and for a lot of people, it's something they have to live with everyday. Still, it makes you wonder: was there really no other way to say what needed to be said, even in a film about mental and physical suffering? Watching this is an emotionally draining ordeal, and if you don't prepare yourself for it, you just might lose yourself in a whirlwind of misery.Doesn't sound like very much fun, does it? Oh well. It's a negative way to end a review for a negative film, and I'm sure that counts as something.",Family Portraits: A Trilogy of America
972575,"Ronnie James Dio has a minor obsession with Gene Simmons. This is just one of the revelations contained in METAL: A HEADBANGER'S JOURNEY. This documentary from Sam Dunn, Scot McFadyen, and Jessica Joy Wise posits itself as an anthropological study of Heavy Metal culture and its perceptions. Narrated and starring Dunn, the film traces the roots of Metal (Black Sabbath) and explores several of the modern subgenres (Cannibal Corpse). Dunn travels far and wide to interview idols, stars, and various ""expert voices"" to provide an interesting, albeit cursory, look at Metal and its various incarnations.With scraggly hair, ratty goatee, and immense collection of band t-shirts, Dunn is anything but a novice on the subject. It's a bit like N!xau hosting a documentary on the bushmen of the Kalahari. Dunn positively fawns over some of the folks he interviews (especially Iron Maiden's Bruce Dickenson, yes, thee Bruce Dickinson) but does a solid job with the rest of his subjects and helped immensely by eloquent rockers such as Dee Snyder and Rob Zombie. The film is loosely divided into subsections, any of which could have been a full length documentary in and of themselves, especially the chapter on Norwegian ""Black Metal"" artists and their love of burning down churches. I was particularly fascinated by the portrayals and perceptions of masculinity among metal mavens from the ubermasculine to the ultrafemme.You can definitely tell that this is a Canadian film as no one else would consider having Geddy Lee in a documentary about Metal.

225683,"The 1970's were a Golden Age for Horror Movies, with films like The Exorcist, Carrie, Jaws, and of course Alien. These films relied on great storytelling, intelligent scripts, above average acting, creepy atmosphere, and slowly building suspense, rather than a constant barrage of special effects and nonstop action. Film makers understood what horror was supposed to do: inspire a feeling of fear and dread in the audience. Alien fits this bill perfectly and is one of the greatest horror films ever made. Several reviewers on Amazon state that it is ""slow,"" and they prefer the second film in the series, ""Aliens."" That's fine, except that this sequel is not a horror film at all but an action film. It is a good movie but belongs to an entirely different genre. I would argue that nonstop action in a horror film is actually boring and counter to what a good film maker is trying to accomplish. Far more effective is to have something violent and awful pop up out of nowhere, when the audience least expects it. Ridley Scott succeeds at this to great effect in Alien. He also creates the creepiest atmosphere ever seen in a horror film. The grungy, claustrophobic ship, the sense of complete isolation, and the very hostile and uninviting feel of the planet where the creature is encountered are incredible, and have often been imitated (mostly unsuccessfully) by lesser film makers since then. The full size model of the ship's interior used in the film truly conveys the feeling of closeness, and is far more effective than modern CGI mumbo jumbo. Scott's masterful direction, coupled with a great script, fine ensemble cast, and sinister creations (creature and alien ship) by H. R. Giger make this a horror film for the ages, not to be missed.",Alien VHS
833817,"Far from the heights, these two Marx Brothers movies are, respectively, at the very bottom and near the middle of their achievements. ""Room Service"" is painfully flat, utterly devoid of whimsy or humor. Perfunctory appearances by Lucille Ball and Ann Miller do not improve things. ""At the Circus"" has some grand moments and while it's no ""Monkey Business,"" it's got some nice Dumont/Groucho stuff and the ""colored music"" scene is not as racist as I'd remembered.",N/A
640588,"This version has its merits.  The scenery is terrific, and the one scene in the morning mist with the sun rising is incomparably beautiful.  Mary and Anne de Bourgh are treated more sympathetically than in the BBC miniseries' version, and Jane and Wickham are very good-looking (as they're written in the novel).  Judi Dench as Lady Catherine is good.The two-hour time frame makes it difficult to develop the story very much, so basically everything that isn't Lizzy-Darcy is truncated (Lizzy-Jane, Lizzy-Mr. Bennet relationship, even Lydia and Wickham is shortened).  Some of the period stuff (another reviewer mentioned the bedroom visits, and the costuming) is a little off.  But these aren't major problems, at least for me.My main issue with it is that it feels like a twenty-first century version of the story.  It is more angsty, and it takes a very modern young person view of Lizzy and Darcy--that is, it has them behave emotionally more like us moderns would at their ages rather than the Lizzy and Darcy of the novel and of two centuries ago.  It's got a twinge of the WB teenage drama in it.The cleverness and the wit of Austen's work are minimal here, and it feels more somber.  Mr. Bennet's ""sarcastic humor"" is gone; his lines are delivered seriously.  Mr. Collins' servility and Mrs. Bennet's nerves and silliness are much toned down from their BBC versions, making the characters more personable, but it feels just a little less.  (Less amusing, for sure.)I had trouble caring for this movie's Lizzy and Darcy.  Austen's Elizabeth had an easy playfulness and a quickness about her.  This Elizabeth has lost most of her witty humor (albeit fitting of the more serious tone of the movie) and thus comes across a little shrill, without the lively charm to cover for her more ""insolent"" moments.She is emotional and flighty, swinging from smiling and giggly to crying hard, to yelling (raising her voice) at Darcy during the first proposal--which seems a little weird for the restrained manners of that time period.  This Elizabeth feels more like a modern, fiery teenager than the proper, confident but lively novel heroine.Darcy, here, instead of being proud, just comes across as sad.  He has sad puppy dog eyes the entire movie.  To me, it makes Lizzy's rejection seem a lot harsher.  Even the end scene (for American audiences?) didn't make me like them any more--it just felt hokey instead.The novel has Lizzy and Darcy as equals in intellect and in faults--Lizzy to drop her prejudice and Darcy to learn to change his pride.  In this movie version, Lizzy just comes around to where Darcy is; he doesn't change.As a movie taken by itself, not bad, and a fast way to acquaint onself with the basic storyline.  To see a much truer version of the novel, though, watch the 1995/1996 BBC/A&E; miniseries with Ehle and Firth.",N/A

518513,"Though stylish and well crafted, it would be hard to find a more disingenuous, manipulative, and hideous movie than Fight Club.  Imagine a film that showed beautiful people eating a fabulous, decadent meal, savoring every luscious mouthful - then, five minutes before the end, a spokesman for the American Heart Association came on screen with a warning that high fat foods cause heart attacks.  Or, imagine a film showing scantily clad women in provocative poses until, five minutes before the end, a representative from N.O.W. came on screen and warned that we live in a sexist society and, simply by watching this trash, viewers are validating her point.  Such is the awe-inspiring hypocrisy of Fight Club, a film that purports to be a cautionary tale about violence but is in fact a tutorial in it.The basic premise, that urban man has lost touch with his inner Neanderthal, is an interesting one, and would have served as the basis of a good movie.  To see how a better director approached the idea of innate violence, revisit Clockwork Orange, a masterpiece that director Fincher (Se7en - a much better movie) has certainly studied.  Kubrick's chilling adaptation of the Burgess novel came complete with skinheads, one of many similarities between the two works.  The second act of Fight Club is an orgy of brute violence with absolutely no redeeming qualities, and the third act offers one of the shabbiest, cheapest, and stupidest ""reveals"" - or ""aha"" moments - in the history of recent film.  Ed Norton is a really fine actor, but his performance is wasted.  Brad Pitt, by contrast, doesn't get beaten up nearly enough to redeem this abomination.

416151,"This movie is 24 hours of kids being amoral creatures doing whatever strikes their fancy at the moment. Sex, drugs, beating on people, stealing, whatever keeps boredom at bay. There is no script to speak of, just watching them being themselves. One kid called Telly (about 15 or 16) who has AIDS (and may not know it) likes young virgins (12 to 14 year old girls). He's a predator with no conscience at all. Probably a sociopath. And his buddy Casper is a dumb punk who swills beer. He's just as bad as Telly.I have no doubt that teens like this exist. They existed back in the '70s when I was a teen. I'm sure most of the viewers of this disturbing movie don't have children. Perhaps parents need to view this to see what unsupervised teens are doing. I'm sure kids like this are not just only in the slums but in suburbia too. And small towns.

449070,"I would unreservedly rate Impromptu five out of five after two viewings, the reason being it's the most successful period drama I've watched that combines history and farce in a most effectively entertaining manner.Each of the main characters (practically everyone has a distinct voice) are imbued with nothing short of humour and definitive caricature - a steadfast George Sand, a neurotic Chopin, an irreverant Musset, a virile Delacroix, a hyperbolic, quietly intellectual and mild Liszt, a haughty, spiteful and duplicitous Marie D'Agoult and a hysterical Countess who has been so effectively parodied as the patron of minor talents but huge inheritance.As with countless of historical dramas, Impromptu has not been spared a degree of measurement with regards to historical accuracy. I feel that a certain dispense from the facts is acceptable, so far as they remain relevant, and conducive to the development of the story and in this case, the humour.Emma Thompson has proven time and again, her mastery of period drama and her multi-faceted talents.Judy Davis and Bernadette Peters are truly brilliant and entertaining in their convincing and riveting portrayals of Sand (whom you love to emphatize with) and D'Agoult (whom you love to hate), eventually placed at loggerheads.The DVD also comes with a French voice-over not found in many films of French background filmed in English. The dialogue is much more hilarious than the original in English! (especially with George Sand and Marie D'Agoult's parts)... A boon for viewers who wish to improve on their non-native language.The soundtracks are strung together in a most admirable fashion, beginning most lightheartedly with Chopin's fleeting-paced but good-natured Impromptu in A flat, the theme of Sand's ""romantic calling"" in Chopin's first Ballade and the Fantasie-Impromptu near to the end of the film, which should be familiar to almost any viewer.Lush orchestrations have been ""mixed"" in certain parts with the original solo piano excerpts to enhance the dramatic flow. Musical purists need not be overly concerned with this mild cosmetic effect.Overall, it is a film I would recommend without hesitation to  lovers of classical music, historical drama and comedy.",N/A

He is such a great physical comedian, he really throws himself into these parts 100% so that it is truly invigorating to watch.The disc also contains a couple of interviews with Conan (the Irish one in particular being very funny) and some sketeches that never got aired.I think these SNL DVDs could maybe be a bit better value for money, since you only get an hour and a half of material at best, but because they are all divided into sketches it helps for flipping through the disc to get to where you want.

1013350,"Jack Black has that uncanny ability to make physical comedy and overt silliness enjoyable and heart-warming at the same time.  I'm glad he came back  to his roots after his semi-serious stint in Peter Jackson's ""King Kong"".  Physical comedy is what he does best because he throws his all into it fearlessly.Nacho Libre is a Mexican Friar serving as the bored orphanage cook longing to be a famous wrestler.  He teams up with a homeless man who serves as his hapless yet loyal sidekick.  Nacho strives to be the best wrestler, even with the misgivings and caution of the lovely Sister Encarnacion whom he harbors feelings for.

It is upbeat and very easy to get into.Hugh Grant does his whole mumbling routine (which you either love or you hate - I happen to dig it) and the supporting cast is simply brilliant. Andie McDowell's place in this movie is something of a mystery. I don't know if her casting was genius or just grabbing any American actress who had name recognition. Her character should come off as, well, a bit of a whore but Andie couldn't play such a role if her life depended on it. She's just too nice. I think her playing the role may have saved it, though. Any other actress may have come off much less likable in the end.One of the only negative things I can say about this movie, and Richard Curtis, is that the gay people aren't written well. The gays are gay in name only, they just come of as flamboyant asexuals.

It was groundbreaking and very entertaining. Somehow the sequels turned into something that belongs on the Sci Fi channel and not on the big screen. The two sequeals contained nothing but cheap acting that was overdramatic and it seemed like everyone was trying to hard. Some parts of these sequals I thought I was watching Star Trek.

148593,"After the success, or rather lack thereof, of ""Curse of the Pink Panther"", Blake Edwards realized he had to accept that Peter Sellers was no more and that he still needed to bring the name Clouseau back into the franchise, even if it meant giving Sellers' classic character an illegitimate son.Enter future Oscar winner Roberto Benigni, who would actually receive the exact opposite of an Oscar for this role.  He's clean-shaven, part Italian Jacques Gumbrelli Clouseau Jr., not mustached Jacques Clouseau, making this a new character and leaving Benigni to the type of humor that works for him.Unfortunately, the humor doesn't work for the entire movie.  The movie moves almost completely away from the overdone routines of the rest of the series, but there are only a few laugh out loud scenes, with some small chuckles in between.  The biggest problem with the film, though, would have to be the plot.  Pink Panther plots have been mangled messes before, but never to this extent.  There's so much political intrigue and scandal involved that it's hard to figure out what anyone's motivation in, even during the climax.Herbert Lom is back for his final performance as Chief Inspector Dreyfus, now more sane and subdued.  Burt Kwouk is also back reprising his reoccurring role as Kato, the late Clouseau's humble servant.  Disguise master Professor Balls, played in the most recent films by Harvey Korman, is now played by Graham Stark, a friend of Sellers who appeared in different roles in many of the films.  These performances almost make the movie feel like a valid part of the series.Henry Mancini's score, as in all of the films, is the highlight, and Bobby McFerrin's performance of the theme music is perfect.  Especially when it provides the background for a battle between an animated Benigni and the famous Pink Panther cartoon character, racing around a live action concert hall.But the bottom line, sadly, is that the plot's a mess and the film isn't as funny as the Peter Sellers classics, or even the previous entry sans-Sellers, ""Curse of the Pink Panther.""",Son of the Pink Panther VHS
768783,"This is an interesting retrospective of Jethro Tull's journey for the first 25 years. The conceptual format of vintage video excerpts in between clips of band members past and present for a reunion in an English tavern comes off as ideal. ""Witches Promise,"" shown here through a 1971 performance from Top of the Pops will make viewers say, ""Oh my God,"" and a lot of the vintage footage from the first few years is sometimes comical as you see Jethro Tull starting out as a folk-rock outfit trying to find their harder edge, which they eventually did with many years of commercial success. Jethro Tull's best decade was the 70's, musically and artistically, and this DVD should include some more concert footage from that era than what is actually provided. The clips of ""Nothing is Easy,"" ""Minstrel in the Gallery,"" ""Auqalung,"" and ""Songs From the Wood,"" are the highlights, but of all the parts from their 1973 Passion Play tour, the only clip included here is the only dull portion of that whole concept album with ""The Story of the Hare Who Lost His Spectacles,""(never quite understood that part anyway)and the excerpts from Tull's transformation into the 80's seem less interesting, especialy the video for 1989's ""Kissing Willie,"" which only serves as an embarrassment for Tull having to accept that such a great band made such a terrible song and video.

In all likelihood, your premonition will be correct.Okay, I'll admit it. I liked the first ""Final Destination"". It took a tired, old, over-worked premise, the horror film in which dumb teenagers get killed, and added a little twist to it, elaborate Rube Goldberg-esque murders. It was like watching a game of ""Mousetrap"", only with murder. The unique thing about the first film is that many of these `contraptions' ended with a quick cut, just as the victim is about to fall prey, allowing our mind to fill in the blanks. The filmmakers mixed these less gruesome, elaborate machinations with quick, brutal murders, keeping the viewer on their toes, always guessing.""2"" was a mess. A retread with more gruesome elements, robbing the film of any of the interesting work found in the first.""3"", directed by James Wong, an alumnus of ""The X-Files"", and co-creator (some might argue, perpetrator) of the first installment, attempts to use the mix of the first film while adding more gruesome elements, apparently to appease audiences who expect more and more graphic material. It just doesn't work. Part of what holds your interest in the first film is that you are never quite sure how someone will get offed. Some were gruesome. Some were elaborate. In ""3"", all of the methods are elaborate, but all are equally gruesome and graphic in detail. This provides the gore, but none of the shock.The acting? Irrelevant. A bunch of forgettable teenage actors, many of whom would be unable to get jobs on the WB, attempt to make their characters believable. But these attempts fail. Miserably. Then again, any one who goes to see this film isn't going to discover the next Meryl Streep. They want to see some teenagers get killed. That's what this genre is all about and it doesn't fail in that regard.But unlike the first film, it doesn't provide anything new. Yes, the teenagers are killed in different ways, but because they are all gruesome, the film doesn't have any of the surprise or interest the first entry had.Story? Ludicrous. Again, this isn't really the point of these films. An elaborate attempt is made to try to make the story believable. A young teenage girl has a premonition the roller coaster she is about to get on will have a terrible crash, killing her and all of the members of her senior class in the process. She screams and yells and they finally let her off, along with most of her senior class. Her boyfriend remains on the coaster. Soon, the car does jump the tracks and the remaining people all die. But what about the people who got off the ride? The girl soon realizes Death still wants them and will do whatever it can to get them, in the same order they should have died on the roller coaster. If they are able to save someone, Death skips them over and moves on to the next one. If you haven't stopped reading by now, due to the fact that you are laughing so hard at the ludicrous nature of the story, keep reading. The teenager is a photographer for the yearbook. Before they got on the ride, she took a lot of pictures of the Senior Class. As she realizes the survivors will soon die, she also realizes that there are clues to the deaths of the remaining survivors in the pictures. Oh no, not the pictures!The only thing that might have saved this film from the inevitable 99 cent rental bin at your local video store would be if they returned to the original formula of the first installment. Some elaborate murders with quick cuts, and some quick gruesome murders, leaving the viewer on their toes. Instead, they sort of combine both for this new installment, resulting in a predictably gruesome teenage blood fest. It seems sad that horror films have to be so gruesome, so bloody in this day and age. Whatever happened to the great films that left a lot of the horror to your imagination? These were much more effective and will stand the test of time. Instead, filmmakers now seem to feel it necessary to depict every gruesome detail for the viewer. Perhaps they feel that the viewer can no longer use their imagination and needs everything handed to them on a silver platter. When an image is left to your imagination it is usually scarier than anything a filmmaker could create, so let us think about it.Forgettable.Come on, you weren't going to see this were you?

The Mercer brothers - foster brothers in fact- return home to bury their sainted foster mother Evelyn Mercer (played by Fionnula Flanagan).  And Evelyn's boys, who have been for the most channeled into productive lives through her efforts, certainly are familiar with the code of the street.  Once Evelyn's buried, it's time for an eye for an eye - and then some.  I know, this sounds formula like, but it isn't.  What distinguishes this movie is how director Singleton give all the characters dimension and depth, but in such a way that never strips the move of it's shoot-em-up nature.  Make no mistake, this is an extremely violent movie, but at its heart it teaches, without preaching, mutual love and respect for family.  Given the vehicle, a revenge flick, this is a really hard to thing to pull off, with most directors just increasing the body count and bullets to compensate.  But Singleton succeeds brilliantly.  In particular, I was impressed by what must be one of Wahlberg's best performances.  Too often lately he's been packaged as some sort of super cool Steve McQueen type, a really icy dude. In contrast, ""Four Brothers"" taps into Wahlberg's inner thug, seeing at last the fire and passion that you sensed was always there, but had been kept largely under wraps.

Maybe you have to read the book before you watch the movie, or you will gradually lose the chain of events. The only thing in the movie that has Miyazaki's signature, is the moving castle itself. It is artistically depicted. The rest is just like any other Japanimation.In general I am not saying this is a bad animation, but it is lower than my expectation from Miyazaki and his studio (specially after watching his other works).",N/A

862492,"In my review of the album Fallen I quoted Lemmy of Motorhead saying that the album was above and beyond the call of duty. The rest of the quote was that he felt they couldn't do it live. Well I have to disagree with Mr Kilminster as having seen the 'World Domination' tour on it's Australian leg I have to say that the band sounded spot on. And this CD shows that they can actually fill up the sound mix just like on their breakthrough album.This is actually a bit of a no frills thing in terms of audio. The sound is fine, the band are tight which is interesting given the personnel dramas of the time. The crowd noise appears to have been phased in and out though that's a fairly regular situation. The main difference between these tunes from Fallen and their live versions here is that the sound does sound a touch hollower.Really this is a cash in job on their fame. Putting out a live album when you've got next to no back catalogue is a bit cheeky. It also serves to fill the gap between their albums - aforementioned personnel upheavals no doubt played their part. Not that filling in time between albums w/ live releases and curiosities is a new idea (G'n'R Lies anyone?).For fans of this band this is probably essential listening. The songs do sound good, the crowd is suitably adoring and they are a likeable project.Three stars for the strength of the songs and because it doesn't feel like there has been massive overdubs.The fourth star for the extra DVD which shows the band putting in value. They did also sell the DVD separately for a while however. Make sure you get this version with the DVD already in it as it really is worthwhile viewing.",N/A
914840,"WARNING... possible spoilers ahead.In CUP OF MY BLOOD, a pornographic photographer finds out that he's meant to be the last Guardian of the Holy Grail. This is basically a soft-core porn version of the DaVinci Code. If you are practicing Christian or are easily offended, you might want to skip this movie and the rest of this review.The movie starts off like the Ring, but instead of a video tape that kills anyone that watches it, it's an old wooden box which contains the one and only Holy Grail. Everybody that opens the box and sees the Grail dies a horrible death. Enter the pornographic photographer, who is struggling to take artistic pictures for a porn website. His boss is a stereotypical creepy businessman who keeps telling the photographer that he's trying too hard. As you might imagine, this gives the filmmakers plenty of opportunity to show nekked ladies. It spirals into soft-core mediocrity pretty quickly.Somehow, the photographer realizes that there's a secret code hidden on this porn website called ""The Second Cumming"". He clicks on a link and is given a series of clues that lead him to discover that the Holy Grail really exists, and that he is the meant to be inducted into a group of Sacred Knights that protect the cup... kind of like the old Knight from Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade. I couldn't really tell if the filmmakers were trying to be clever or shocking and irreverent. The end result is that it's not any of the above. It comes off more as a poorly executed live action version of a South Park episode. This actually might have made a good South Park. I can almost see Cartman web-surfing through a bunch of porn websites and finding out that the cup of Christ exists and that he's supposed to be the Guardian of the Holy Grail. When you start thinking that a horror movie is akin to South Park, you know you're in trouble.While our porn photographer tries to deny that he's destined to be a Templar Knight, he's almost seduced by a girl that he used to photograph. She turns out to be a demon, or a succubus or something. The succubus tries to get her hands on the Grail, but our porno photographer wins out and protects the cup of Christ from the demonic bimbo. This movie is pretty empty. It's not shocking, it's not controversial, it's just boring. Whether or not you are easily offended, you can skip this one and not feel like you've missed anything. Watch an episode of South Park instead.",Cup of My Blood
744369,"Season 4 of DS9 probably featured the show at its most consistent.  The episodes that helped progress the Dominion arc were almost all solid and entertaining, resulting in an excellent season that delivered action, intrigue, and plenty of tense conflict.  The addition of Worf was a particularly good move, since his charismatic presence provided both a fair share of action heroics and effective humor.The series stumbled from this point, however, with season 5 being a bit of a step backwards (but still engaging) and season 6 a huge disappointment in particular, as it was populated with too many humor-based episodes in a season that should have been overwhelmingly dark and intense now that the war had taken off.  Thankfully, season 7 delivered the punch I'd expected, and while it isn't as consistent in quality as season 4, the series finished off with some exceptional Dominion War episodes including the excellent Final Chapter arc that delivered grand-scale action, intrigue, suspense, and emotion.  But that's another story.The Way of the Warrior, Part I- A-.  An engrossing set-up that could lead to potential war between the Klingons and the Federation.The Way of the Warrior, Part II- A-.  The pay-off is absolutely spectacular.  This is one of the most thrilling DS9 episodes I've seen; the sequence where the Klingons invade DS9 is one of the most ambitious and exciting pieces of action filmmaking in Star Trek history.The Visitor- B.  A low-key Trek piece.  This one melds plot and emotion rather nicely, even if the solution to the dilemma proves to be a little contrived.Hippocratic Oath- C.  While it's interesting to see more details about the Jem'Hadar, this episode just isn't all that compelling.Indiscretion- B.  An enjoyable adventure piece, thanks to the interesting chemistry between Kira and Dukat.  Dukat, in particular, develops into a rather fascinating character when we see a personal side of him we've not seen before.Starship Down- B.  Though this episode never grips with as much suspense or excitement as it should, it delivers enough action to satisfy.  I am curious, though, as to why destroying those Jem'Hadar fighters wouldn't immediately result in all-out war.Homefront- B.  The tension continues to build as the Dominion engage in a terrorist attack on Earth.  Though it begins a bit on the slow side, this episode develops some pretty solid suspense towards the end.Paradise Lost- B.  A satisfying conclusion to Homefront, this fairly taut and suspenseful episode delivers more interesting developments towards the Dominion arc.Return to Grace- B+.  Another Kira/Dukat episode, and since I find their chemistry quite compelling, it doesn't hurt to see another episode focusing on these two again so soon.  It also doesn't hurt that there's quite a bit of exciting action and suspense here as well.Sons of Mogh- B.  I've always liked Tony Todd as Worf's brother Kurn, so it's nice to see him one last time.  It's mostly a good episode that delivers some big laughs and decent drama, but the ending feels like a total cheat.Hard Time- B.  The biggest problem with this episode is that you just know the events that occurred here will never be brought up again, even though we all know it should have affected O'Brien more drastically than the series would like to admit.To the Death- B. For about 3/4's of this episode's running time, it's a very compelling look into the lives of the Jem'Hadar, but just when you expect it to take off, the climactic hand-to-hand combat seems rather limply staged, at least when compared to such similar scenes featured in The Way of the Warrior.The Quickening- A-.  My second favorite episode of the season behind only The Way of the Warrior, this Bashir-centered piece is quite moving, with one of DS9's more effective bittersweet endings I've seen (enhanced by a particularly cool swooping crane shot).Broken Link- B.  A solidly interesting episode, though it boggles the mind when you consider what happens in season 7, meaning Odo was actually infected with 2 diseases here?!  The cliffhanger's pretty good, I might add.",N/A
177599,"This movie exposed some serious problems with industry and government alike and demonstrated why we have made so little progress in reducing our dependence on oil. But it actually also exposed the general apathy that allows these problems to continue. As with the electric car, the movie itself did not generate much interest.Notwithstanding, it is a really interesting movie. It ties nicely with the title of ""Who Killed the Electric Car?"" by looking at the suspects which include: Car Companies, Oil Companies, Consumers, Government, the California Air Resources Board (CARB), Battery Technology, and Fuel Cells.The actions of GM in scrapping the electric car and destroying its remnants make it look sinister. And there appears to be a serious conflict of interest for a number of government officials who have had positions in the oil and auto industry.One interesting point in this movie is whether Fuel Cells will be really ever be viable. It raises the question as to whether the hype about Fuel Cells is really a diversion by the auto and oil industries to delay any real progress in developing a battery powered electric car which can effectively compete with gasoline powered cars.The movie questions the motives of the California Air Resources Board in eliminating its Zero Emissions Vehicle mandate, which required 2% of the vehicles sold in California to be emissions free by 1998 and 10% emissions free by 2003. Unbelievably, the Chairman of the California Air Resources Board subsequently became the chairman of the California Fuel Cell Partnership--which makes his actions that ultimately eliminated battery powered electric vehicles appear to be an incredible conflict of interest.This movie is thought provoking and easy to watch. Hopefully it will help inspire the comeback of the electric car.  At least one small company, Tesla Motors, is now making a highly road worthy (albeit expensive at this point) electric car.",N/A

The life that is full of challenges and changing relationships, only support and love of your friends can make it easy and sweet.One thing about this sitcom is that unlike other shows, you never get bored of watching them over and over again.

I actually had the season 4 and 7 bought individually, but when I saw this Limited edition set, I just couldn't stop myself.

949088,"Am looking forward to this release. The first season of""AOS"" was hands down the best, but season two was undeniably the second best...and contains some of the most exciting andvividly-recalled episodes of the entire series, such as thewonderful ""Panic In the Sky"", ""The Defeat of Superman"", and""Superman in Exile"". Some reviewers have deemed ""Panic In theSky"" the ""signature"" piece of the series, but I would have tosay that ""Panic"" has to share that honor with the the secondepisode from series one, ""The Haunted Lighthouse"". A good bitof the physical violence from year one has been toned down forseason two (no old women in wheelchairs being pushed down stairs or ramps...and NOTHING like the graphic scene in ""Crime Wave"" where a dock worker has his legs crushed between two trucks). This season Superman dealt more with ""thumps"" to criminal assailants rather than punches that would in theory have killed them. This was a far cry from the almost gleeful murderousness (throwing crooks off buildings, crushing one withan automobile engine) of Tom Tyler's ""Captain Marvel"" in the Republic serial of that name. This new approach sat better withparents and worked out well for the rest of the series' run.The replacement of Phyllis Coates by Noell Neil was the biggest change that was readily noticeable. Neil was winsomely pretty and a fine, fine actress. She is also the image of Lois Lane most ""boomers"" retain in their minds from ""back then"" (wasalso the cameo ""Mrs. Lane""...Lois's ""mother""...in the trainsesquence from the 1st Christopher Reeve ""Superman"" movie).  While Neil is adored by the fans, it has to be stated that ""her"" Lois was toned down by the producers and made more ofa perennial ""damsel in distress"" than was the Coates version. The Coates Lane was the BEST Lane...a regular wildcat in a Burlap bag...and it was (I have always felt) a regrettable decision by the ""powers that be"" to tone that feistiness down so much.The second season closes out with one of the best loved andbest remembered of all the Superman episodes: ""Around the World With Superman"". It has no criminals, crimes, or conspiracies init, nor any real threats to anyone concerned. Yet it holds asoft spot in many a ""boomer"" heart.It is a ""five hankie weeper"", a real warm/fuzzy stand-up-and-shout ""hooray"" episode...just don't let anybody see your wet eyes if you are agood macho man.  In season one there was an episode that got a very favorable fan response. ""The Birthday Letter"" concerned alittle girl whose legs were crippled with polio (she was in legbraces). She wrote a letter to the Daily Planet asking if Superman would take her to the fair and he promised to do so. Some sleazoid crooks with a fake man of steel got into the actand things didn't go so well at first. Then Superman won the day and took the little girl on a whirlwind flying tour of Metropolis. It was a real lip-trembler of an ending. Well, in season two the production team decided to try repeating thatkind of a heart-tugger episode. ""Around the World"" is the result.It is a re-working of the little-girl-in-leg-braces theme, but here a little girl is BLIND. In this story a blind child's parents seek help from Superman. They have been told there is a ""chance"" that a very delicate operation can repair their daughter's optic nerve and give her sight. The only hang-up is that her surgeons would need to work under guidance fromsome kind of ultra-powerful x-ray machine and nothing in existence is that powerful....except perhaps Superman's x-ray vision. Superman agrees to lend a hand. Complications ensue (but of COURSE!!!), but finally the operation is at hand. Before surgery the child tells Superman that there are all sorts of wonderful places she has heard about, but never seen...not even pictures of...the pyramids, the Eiffel Tower...many, many places and things. And she hopes to really see these sights , now... if all goes well. Well, things DO go well and she gains her sight...but she doesn't need PICTURES to see all the things she's dreamed of seeing. With the glorious ""AOS"" theme pounding on the sound track, she sees them ALL... FIRST HAND. The title""Around the World With Superman"" says it all. It always had viewers sniffling and dabbing at their eyes...even pint-sized junior macho men, and some magazine once deemed it one of thegreatest ""hanky jobs"" in the golden age of television.

623859,"In this day and age of Hollywood films, we have to accept the role of product placement that inhabits all major productions. Having said that, this film blows the idea so out of proportion that it is pretty much unbearable. Practically every scene that takes place in the terminal itself forces a brand name in your face and it's just a constant reminder of what remains most important in Hollywood nowadays. An argument could be made that all those stores exist in real terminals, but the way they are placed in the center of every scene just becomes too much. They include burger king, starbucks, borders books, yoshinoya, discovery channel store, and there's a few more. The best scene is one in which tom hanks is asked to do some translating for airport officials, but the story falls kind of flat and catherine zeta jones' character is pretty worthless.

985534,"""The Three Burials of Melquiades Estrada"" is Tommy Lee Jone's directorial debut and is written by Guillermo Arriaga. Most people are probably scratching their head in confusion about this last name mentioned. Arriaga wrote ""21 Grams"", the Oscar nominated film with Sean Penn & Naomi Watts. Watching this movie, not knowing he had written it until after the movie was over, I noticed a lot of similarities. Arriaga sets us up with a mystery, one which we already know the answer to, and still slowly leads us up to it before really starting the story. Also like ""21 Grams"", the film is told in chronological order but features random flashbacks and jump aheads with no real warning. This film has a different director, so the final cut looks a lot different from ""21 Grams"" but the vibe is still there. The movie also stars Jones as Pete Perkins, a cowboy who seems to be stuck in the past. He lives in a small part of Texas right near the Mexican border in present times but acts like the cowboys you see in old John Wayne movies, except Pete is obviously a little off. Then there's Mike Norton (Barry Pepper, ""The Green Mile"") who moves into a new house with his bored wife Lou Ann (January Jones, ""American Wedding"") to start his new job as border control. We see several scenes where he beats some of the crossers and it's plain obvious that this guy isn't a very nice person. Jumping back, we see Pete meet Melquiades Estrada (Julio Cesar Cedillo), a Mexican alien-cowboy who Pete hires as a ranch hand but shortly befriends. One day, Melquiades makes Pete promise that if he shall ever die Pete must take his body to a place called Jiminez in Mexico where his wife lives. There is a twist that pretty much turns the whole premise around, but calling it a twist doesn't sum it up. This ""twist"" comes out of nowhere, is not elaborated on, and soon after the movie ends. Maybe I wasn't paying attention, although I'm damn sure I was, but this didn't make that much sense to me. But that's not entirely true, I get that the one character in the situation is having hallucinations...But the whole thing wasn't a hallucination. You'll see what I'm talking about when you see the movie. Anyway, this came out in 2005 but was quickly forgot about because of another cowboy movie. If you don't know what movie I'm referring to, you're not familar with pop culture at all. I can't say what a few critics have said (that this movie is equally good), but it is entertaining and Tommy Lee Jones gives one of his best performances in years. Dwight Yoakam co-stars as a cop named Belmont, I guess I really have no explanation for his character. This is a fantastic, and at times affecting, movie that shouldn't be missed. I don't know if it was one of the best films of 2005, but it's one of the few films like those that stays with you.GRADE: A-",N/A
431345,"I just love all the science fiction efforts from the 1950's. They always seem to have a real energy about them that often even makes the most absurd goings on enjoyable. The themes of these films generally dealt with the world being invaded by evil aliens intent upon destroying mankind, or having various capital cities being levelled by over sized creatures awakened by man's careless atomic testing. This little effort ""The Brain From Plant Arous"", was a title which until recently was strangely unfamiliar to me. Starring one of my favourite 1950's sci fi actors in John Agar it tells a slightly different tale of an evil brain (!) that travels from the Planet Arous and possesses the mind of brilliant young scientist Agar and using his body seeks to conquer the world by destroying anyone or anything that stands in its way. Despite the way out plot idea and the hilarious brain floating in mid air in many scenes I actually found the premise of this story quite an interesting one and despite the limitations of John Agar's acting style he did well in the part of the inquisitive scientist who goes through the torment of having his mind and body taken over by an evil alien force intent upon destruction. Undoubtedly this story about evil brains taking over a man's body will never be in the same class as classics from this decade such as the original ""War of the Worlds"", or ""The Day the Earth Stood Still"", however the cast do treat the material with great respect and manage to keep a real seriousness in the proceedings that makes it especially enjoyable.",Brain from Planet Arous VHS

916481,"When I was watching the movie, I couldn't help but write down some of the more ridiculous scenes that this film's masterminds constructed. It was a long, long list.One of my favorites was right in the beginning of the film. The two doctors in charge of a rather ridiculous and, at this stage of our scientific development, quite impossible, repeatedly refer to each other as ""ex"". Truth is, they're still married, and the still wear their rings.Some drama is made about the wife's ring, and she runs out of the rather large science facility to a remote dock where the sharks swim to get soap so that she can get the ring off.Now come on. In this entire science building, there isn't a single bar of soap anywhere? And it's safer for to leave said building and venture into the shark's den (even if they are, supposedly, well controlled)?Nah.And we know what happens. The ring falls off. She bends to pick up the ring and falls face first into the water. By some strange fortune, she finds herself floating on her back (a neat trick, considering that she was unconscious), and she's rescued by her husband - er, ex-husband, I think - and their assistant.This example fairly well sets the tone of illogic that follows the film from beginning to end.I only watched this because it was on cable (OnDemand), and free. And I thought it would be funny to see how absolutely horrid it was.And I wasn't disappointed. It was horrid.Unless you enjoy laughing at stupid movies because they're so ridiculously stupid (although I have to say that the only way you could really be laughing is if you were doing what I was doing - compiling notes to write a review), this might be for you. But I would say probably not.",Blue Demon

997942,"First and foremost, I must say the previous reviewer is correct in that this consists of two (2) dvds and does not feature the blender that most Quick Fix Total Mix users are accustomed to seeing.That said, I love this set of dvd's with the space saving of having two discs in one box. I love the workouts particularly the kickboxing segments with Janis. She is an awesome instructor, not too chatty or cutesy. Her cueing is well done and I love the ability to first concentrate on the movement, learning at half-time and then performing the action at regular speed. It certainly aids in learning form quickly and correctly. I have done Tae-Bo in the past but his cueing and counting left much to be desired. The upper, lower and core segments afford you the opportunity to pick your poison for the day or do all three workouts with or without the bonus workout. As a person with a full-time job and a full course load, I appreciate being able to get in 10-40 minutes of work, whatever I choose, prior to getting on with my day. It is a mood and energy booster. The cardio hip-hop is fun but usually done on days when I don't feel like exerting myself much by punching and kicking. Don't think you won't sweat b/c you will, it's just a nice change of pace.All in all I really like this set but that's because I did not own them individually prior to now. I did have to take away a star for the misleading title and description on the box. Yes it rankles a bit that it is billed as a Total Mix, when it is, in fact, not one but if you don't already have one or the other discs individually get the set and pass the single on to someome else.*** Update: May 1, 2007I am pleased to report that Quick Fix has repaired the 'two' dvd issue. I picked up the set, again, last night hoping they repaired the problem and yeah, they have. A friend will be lucky enough to inherit the two dvd's and I will be using the blender option regularly. As an aside you don't have to only use the blender option with this one you can play both segments separately as well. Yeah Quick Fix.",N/A

George Reeves Feature Filmography10.Advertising GallerySpecial footnote, George Reeves was an American actor best known for playing the title role in the television series Adventures of Superman (1953-1958) ... Reeves found himself so associated with Superman and Clark Kent that it was difficult for him to find other roles, as did other actors associated with iconic roles, like Ralph Byrd with Dick Tracy, and Bela Lugosi with Dracula ... after two seasons with Adventures of Superman, Reeves expressed dissatisfaction with the one dimensional role and the low pay, at 40 years old, he wished to quit and move on. Friends and contemporaries like Alan Ladd, Victor Mature and Robert Mitchum had become major stars, with major roles in A-pictures, getting paid substantially more than Reeves's Superman salary ... over the course of the 104 episodes, Reeves often showed gentlemanly behavior to his fellow actors, he insisted that his original Lois Lane, Phyllis Coates, be given equal billing in the credits in the first season, when Coates was replaced by Noel Neill (who had played Lois Lane in the Kirk Alyn serials), Reeves quietly defended her nervousness on her first day when he felt the director was being too harsh with her. (ref: Neill in video documentary ""First Lady of Metropolis,"" included on DVD compilation of Season 2 episodes, released in 2006) ... at times Reeves delighted in standing outside camera range, mugging at the other cast members to see whether he could break them up ... by all accounts there was a strong camaraderie among the principals ... Reeves performed various charity work for the many young fans and gave generously of himself wherever needed.Great job by VCI Entertainment for releasing the ""George Reeves Double Feature: Thunder in the Pines & Jungle Goddess"" (1948), digital transfere with a clean, clear and crisp print...looking forward to more of the same from the '40s and '50s vintage...order your copy now from Amazon or VCI Entertainment, stay tuned once again for epics and jungle adventures that only VCI Entertainment (King of the Serials) can deliver.Total Time: 124 mins on DVD ~ VCI Home Video KPF-570 ~ (11/28/2006)",N/A

347329,"After quitting `Monty Python's Flying Circus' in 1973, John Cleese went on to create his best work in his career so far - actually the best comedy ever made in the history of the world. That is `Fawlty Towers,' incredibly funny comedy about the worst hotel and its delightfully arrogant owner Basil Fawlty. It is regrettable that they only made 12 episodes.`A Romance with a Double Bass,' shot in 1974, prior to the 1st six episodes of `Fawlty,' is NOT the unreleased 13th episode about Basil and Polly though it features three of the actors seen in this landmark comedy, and contains some funny moments. You also should not expect the craziness of Monty, such as Cleese doing silly walk. No, it is a love story, and John Cleese means it ... even though he is stark naked.Based on Chekhov's short story, `A Romance with a Double Bass' opens with double bass player Smychkov (Cleese) arriving at the Russian palace where a betrothal ball is going to be held. As he arrived too early on a hot summer's day, he decides to take a bath in a lake nearby, little knowing that the Princess (Booth) has done the same.Things get complicated (and funny) when a passing thief takes away the clothes of the both. Chivalrous Smychkov promises the distraught Princess to bring her back safely to the palace like a true gentleman. Luckily, the thief didn't steal the double bass case. in which the naked Princess can hide.Their misadventure results in the unexpected romance of the two, which is the most charming of the film. John Cleese and Connie Booth (then married) manage to show enough chemistry between them to convince us of the budding romance in spite of the short running time of the film.This 40 minute film may sound like an extended sketch from `Monty Python' at first, but John Cleese and Connie Booth (both credited as writer) are obviously trying to make the film not too silly. The behaviors of both characters, funny as they are, are always based on the reasonable motives, so you will never see a dead parrot or flying sheep here.Additional fun is the appearance of Andrew Sachs as musician, who was later cast as Manuel in `Fawlty Towers.' The film also has British character actor Freddie Jones, and is directed by Robert Young, the original director of `Fierce Creatures' starring John Cleese.For all its background, `A Romance with a Double Bass' should be enjoyed out of the context of two leading actors' careers. Don't try to find any `Monty' sketch nor `Fawlty Towers' episode. It is a romance from a Russian writer, Anton Chekhov, master of storytelling, and this charming adaptation well-reflects the fact.",N/A

646099,"June 16, 1959. The day George Reeves, the man who was Superman, died. Was it suicide as officially reported or murder? And if it was murder, who did it? This is the central question in the film 'Hollywoodland'.On the surface, 'Hollywoodland' and 'The Black Dahlia', released within a week of each other, are very similar. Both deal with the investigation of a real life mystery in Hollywood during the years following World War II. However, each approaches its subject differently. In the case of 'Hollywoodland', the noirish film combines drama and docudrama.The film begins with the death of George Reeves before introducing the fictional detective, Louis Simo (inspired by a real detective who investigated the death of George Reeves). As the film moves back and forth between Simo's investigation and Reeves' life of trying to become a successful film actor in the Hollywood system but instead becoming typecast as the Man of Steel on television, it is clear Reeves' life is being recreated through the knowledge, theories and conclusions of the investigation. Through Simo's eyes, the film presents the ambiguous evidence and provides several theories of George Reeves' death.'Hollywoodland' features a strong cast headed by Adrian Brody as Louis Simo. Simo is a complicated and flawed character; a detective committed more to making money from an investigation than doing the investigation and willing to manipulate the media or his client to his benefit. However, he also proves to be a loving father with more reason to further his investigation into Reeves' death due to the despondency of his son over his television superhero's death.The cast portraying real people is equally strong with Bob Hoskins as studio head Eddie Mannix, Robin Tunney as Reeves' fianc&eacute;e Leonore Lemmon and Lois Smith as Reeves' mother Helen Bessolo but Diane Lane stands out as Reeves' girlfriend and Eddie Mannix' wife Toni Mannix. A long-time force in Reeves' life she glides from a strong confident woman in the beginning of their relationship to desperation as she tries to maintain control of him and finally to an aging broken woman.Along with Diane Lane, Ben Affleck's performance as George Reeves also stands out. While he only superficially looks like Reeves, despite the added weight, that quickly becomes forgotten and unimportant as Affleck's mannerisms, stance and voice transform him into the man who reluctantly became Superman.Although not without flaws, which initially make it difficult to tell that Reeves' life is being seen through Simo's eyes, 'Hollywoodland' is an excellent film. It has a strong script, strong cast, great characters and interesting story told in an interesting way about a beloved yet tragic actor during the Golden Age of Hollywood. While the answer to how George Reeves died will likely never be definitively known, 'Hollywoodland' provides a few possibilities which have been and will continue to be debated.",N/A

Anyway, 3.5 hours later and well into the night I realized I was getting close to the end. Once I started watching I was hooked -- didn't move or leave the room! The setting is of course sci-fi, but this is about as far removed from Star Trek as you can get in a space ship. Great on its own as a movie with fantastic directing and cinemography.

424314,"Wonder Bar is like Grand Hotel in a nightclub. It features many notable stars including Al Jolson, Ricardo Cortez, Dolores del Rio, Dick Powell, Kay Francis, and Guy Kibbee. It focuses on the love lives of each character; most mingle together and are rather complex. However, this is more of an exhibition of the actor's and their own personalities than an important film, but that makes the film fun since it has a great cast. It also features some extravagant musical numbers choreographed by the wonderful Busby Berkeley.Al Jolson is the star of the show; he absolutely exudes personality in every step and really carries the film. Ricardo Cortez and the exotic Dolores del Rio carry on a tempestuous but tepid relationship but add nothing memorable. Dick Powell's part is small but his trademark boyish quality shines brightly. Kay Francis is adequate as an adultering society girl; her speech impediment is very cute. Guy Kibbee is a boisterous drunk as usual, and fun as usual.The musical numbers are very fun to watch. They could never have been staged in the Wonder Bar, but they bring the audience to another world, something vital during The Great Depression. Berkeley plays with mirrors and beautiful girls to trick and astound the eye. The final number is a vehicle for Jolson; he dons blackface and dances to snappy jazz tunes in a black heaven. This number is filled with stereotypes like watermelon, mules, and shooting craps, but all of it is done in fun and was not meant to offend or discriminate.",Wonder Bar VHS

950496,"I wanted to like this. I generally love Wes Craven. I generally love suspense. And while this was ""an action packed thrill ride"". It was a very flawed movie.I did enjoy it. It's not by any means unwatchable, but it is implausible to the point where I couldn't stop laughing at the insane twists by the end of the film. Unfortunately, since the first 2/3 or so of the film were set up so well - very gritty, realistic, suspenseful, and very evocative of helplessness, that made the last part of the movie that much stupider. Suddenly we've gone from a creditable Hitchcock pastiche to a Warner Brothers cartoon. If it had been goofy all the way through, it would have been better than switching styles in mid-stream.Also, while I like Wes Craven, he's got some serious issues - for one thing, the main two characters look AND ACT almost exactly like Sydney and Billy from Scream, and the dichotomy (she good/he bad) is identical, it just becomes clear a lot earlier. Wes needs to play with his own stereotypes and make a BAD brunette GIRL for a change.RED EYE is the kind of movie that fails, but has enough talent and good charm. It tries hard with very little and in the end will probably be considered one the most riveting and yet forgettable movies of 2005.",N/A

264992,"The movies may not be anamorphic 5-1 audio remastered editions, but should they be? I remember seeing them in the theater at eight years old, (Star Wars) eleven years old (Empire Strikes Back) and fourteen years old (Jedi). The original film has simple two channel stereo. I remember the original movies had pops and cracks in the theater. There were discrepancies in the film. 13 year olds will not likely remember those days, but doing this movie in ""new, better"" style will get in the way of the real memories. The magic will be gone. In regard to the criticism that the movies are presented in full screen- are your copies like that? If so, they must be some rare special pan-and-scan editions. Mine are all letterbox, which is good because I generally hate pan-and-scan. They are not anamorphic, but they are complete. They may not fill the screen of a modern TV set (nor do I really care because I am still using one of those ""old"" 4:3 television sets) but they are better than the original video release. I still remember renting Star Wars on Beta as soon as it was released on tape so I would be able to enjoy it again at home. I had the cassette audio story tapes and literally dreamt of being able to watch Star Wars at home somehow. Now we have all the re-mastered super video editions with added scenes and better graphics etc. but these discs are where the real memory lies. Watching the opening crawl without the Episode number in Star Wars, hearing Luke comment on how lucky R2D2 is that he doesn't taste very good (on Dagobah) and seeing Sebastian Shaw as Anakin once again rather than Hayden Christiansen at the end of Jedi makes it all worth the money for me.","Star Wars - Episode IV, A New Hope VHS"

172433,"Ang Lee's slightly overhyped ""Brokeback Mountain"" was a decent story about a relationship forged between two Wyoming cowboys played by Heath Ledger and Jake Gyllenhaal who were to become lifelong soulmates.  The film benefited from Hollywoods perchant for heralding particular themes when selecting films for awards.  This years theme of alternative lifestyles elevated the film's status.  No question the film was cinematographically stunning with its gorgeous western panoramic vistas and desolate Wyoming towns.  The relationship between the men was poignant yet the film dragged at points.Their tabooed relationship was in stark contrast to the social mores present in the 60's and 70's in the remote West.  Ledger in particular was very effective as the taciturn Ennis Del Mar who finds love with Gyllenhaal playing Jack Twist as they work a summertime job of sheepherding on Brokeback Mountain.  Both men go on to marry and have children existing in largely unfulfilling relationships.  After a hiatus of four years they reconnect are able to find chunks of time where they go off together.The stories chronicles the evolution of their relationship over an approximately 15-20 year period of time that culminates unfortunately in tragedy.Ang Lee did a nice job in his direction and hefty Randy Quaid did well in his portrayal of the sheepherding boss Joe Aguirre.",N/A

62614,"After the dull and somewhat dismal CHILD'S PLAY 3, the franchise was revitalized with BRIDE OF CHUCKY.  Having been dismembered in the previous film, Charles Lee Ray's former girlfriend, Tiffany (Jennifer Tilly) gets the pieces back and puts them back together.  After performing an incantation, Chucky is brought back to life.  Re-united with his former love, Chucky isn't content on being a doll alone and kills Tiffany and resurrects her as a doll, too.  They need a couple of human beings to serve as hosts and a young couple who are running away to get married seem like the best candidates.  The highway honeymoon turns into a blood-bath on wheels as the murderous dolls enact their devilish plan.Jennifer Tilly was the perfect match to play Tilly and her vivid characterization breathed life into the stale series.  Brad Dourif, as usual, does a great job voicing the plastic-death-doll.  The other actors in the movie are pretty much standard fare, except John Ritter is a treat to watch as Police Chief Warren Kincaid (he also suffers a particularly gruesome death).The Child's Play movies have always had a lot of comedy involved, but in BRIDE OF CHUCKY, the filmmakers seemed to make the movie more of a comedy rather than a horror flick.  In many ways, BRIDE OF CHUCKY is a parody of the entire Chucky franchise.  That doesn't mean that the film isn't a horror picture.  There is a lot of gore and gruesome acts in this movie, such as nails driven into a person's face.  There's just a lot of edgy humor and funny-bad one-liners, too.Next to the original CHILD'S PLAY, BRIDE OF CHUCKY is the 2nd-best film in the Chucky franchise.",N/A

495366,"I originally saw this movie in the early 80's when I was an impressionable child.  It was one of those notorious films that kids whispered about--one filled with plenty of nudity and brutality.  Along with ""Last House on the Left"" and ""Faces of Death,"" ""I Spit On Your Grave"" exemplified exploitation cinema.  I didn't particularly like the movie--even then I appreciated the finer arts.  But based on its reputation and its controversial history, I knew I wanted to include this title in my extensive DVD library.  Heck, it must be better than I remembered to have a Deluxe Millennium edition!Well, in truth, it is better than I remembered.  The amateurish quality lends it a gritty realism that actually works in the film's favor.  Over the last couple of decades, we've become a little less sensitized to violence--some of our biggest hits are basically torture movies (think ""Saw"" or ""Hostel"").  So while the rape scenes are still quite disturbing, they are somehow less shocking.  More astounding, Camille Keaton's performance is actually quite accomplished.  Her reactions and subsequent revenge play out quite well.Some claim this film as a feminist treatise, and some as vile female degradation.  It's actually a bit of both--but I don't think the film merits a serious philosophical discussion.  Either way, it was meant to assault your senses--and that it does.Mind you, I'm not claiming ""I Spit On Your Grave"" is a great movie.  But it is essential viewing for those interested in this genre.  And for my money, it has held up better than ""Last House On The Left""--although I do prefer the plot of ""Last House"".A film entitled ""I Spit On Your Grave"" isn't for everyone.  So don't let the charming title fool you, this isn't one for the whole family.  KGHarris, 10/06.",N/A
1036319,"I have been looking forward to seeing this movie but became reluctant after reading the rather mediocre reviews it received from the so-called ""experts"". I decided to ahead and, as usual, the ""experts"" got it all wrong. FLYBOYS not only met my expectations, but also exceeded them.I'm a big history buff and am usually very disappointed with Hollywood's rendition of historical events. For me, it really detracts from a movie when I see things like Sea Sparrow missile launchers on the deck of a destroyer in Pearl Harbor, or when William Wallace supposedly has a torrid affair with a Princess who was, in reality, only three years old at the time of his death, and I expected to find similar fault with this movie. I found no such errors here. The true life story was most accurate, including such details as the lion which served as the mascot for the Escadrille LaFayette, the dented bullets which the flying aces had to sort through before each flight, and the fact that over one million allied soldiers lost their lives at Verdun.Hollywood movie critics have a difficult time with true stories. True life, especially when accurately presented, doesn't always have the same flair as fictionalized accounts, and critics have given rather harsh reviews of the plot, totally missing so many details surrounding such things as camaraderie, respect and traumatic real life emotions. And no, in real life, people don't always live happily ever after and the hero doesn't always ride off into the sunset with his sweetheart.Beyond the historical accuracy portrayed here, the film has sensational filming, particularly in the air battle scenes. The aerial views depict the miles of devastation of French countryside surrounding the trenches. The casting is more than adequate with particular mention going to Jean Reno as Capt. Thenault. James Franco also gives a superb portrayal of American Ace Blaine Rawlings.If you are a history lover, and particularly interested, as I am, in the Great War, I urge you to go and watch this movie. You will find it historically accurate and yet able to bridge the gap into being an entertaining movie. Remember that this is not some Hollywood enhanced idea of war, but rather an accurate depiction of the real life events that surrounded the American pilots who became the Escadrille LaFayette. The critics got this one all wrong. Surprise, surprise.Monty Rainey[...]",N/A

Keanu plays an undercover cop, inhabiting a drug ""nest"" with a collection of drugged-out folks, trying to gather intel on where the drugs come from.

872568,"American nurse, Karen (Sarah Michelle Gellar) decides to move to Tokyo with her boyfriend, Doug (Jason Behr). While she has yet to receive her own assignment, she is always on-call to help someone sick - if needed. When one of her co-workers doesn't report into work, Karen is sent down to an eerie house, where she meets an old woman who does not speak, or eat. She simply sits there and stares into space. Upon further investigation, Karen finds a young Japanese boy taped up into the wall - a young kitten by his side. It is only after a short time that a vengeful spirit comes and attacks both Karen and the old woman, leaving Karen in severe shock, and killing the woman. The vengeful spirit possesses its victims, claiming their souls, then spreads its curse onto another victim, creating a series of unfortunate events. Karen, becoming obsessed with discovering the truth about this spirit, decides that she must either find a way to break the spell, or end up the next victim of a spirit that never dies - but always kills.Even after the mixed reviews I heard about this film, I wanted to view it myself. Perhaps because I'm a huge fan of Sarah Michelle Gellar's (BUFFY THE VAMPIRE SLAYER and CRUEL INTENTIONS), or maybe because I love horror movies. Either way, I purchased, I saw, and I loved THE GRUDGE. Sarah Michelle Gellar is amazing in her performance as Karen, and while she isn't necessarily the star of the film - no one really is - she has such screen presence, that you consider her being just that. Jason Behr (ROSWELL and PLEASANTVILLE) is interesting as the American boyfriend/Architecture student; however, he is another character with not much screen time.The strange thing with this film is that there is hardly any speaking throughout it; and when there is speaking, it is most often done in Japanese, with sub-titles. While this may sound unappealing to viewers, it actually gives the film a larger ""scare"" factor, and makes it more interesting. The fact that THE GRUDGE should be classified more as a psychological thriller, rather than a horror movie is another thing that should be taken into consideration. However, either way it is a fabulous movie that will leave viewers looking over their shoulder when a strange sound is heard. A psychological thriller that will leave you on the edge of your seat from beginning to end.Erika SoroccoFreelance ReviewerBook Review Columnist for The Community Bugle Newspaper",N/A

This version left out some very important events, and emotions seemed washed out rather than passionate and moving. I like long movies, but this dragged because it just doesn't hold your attention.  The 1997 Masterpiece Theatre version is so much more powerful, and keeps all important events intact, spending less time on Maggie's mother worrying about the fate of her china, and more on character and plot development, with a very haunting score.  I really hope the other version is released on DVD-if so, I will probably donate this one to the library, because I can't quite see myself rewatching it. I would rather read the book, instead.",N/A
199472,"This is such a bizarre movie.  I find it alternatively touching, poignant, annoying and ridiculously funny depending on how I look at it.  First of all, the plot has so many holes you could drive a tank through them.  Let's see, somehow all the forests on Earth were destroyed and a decision was made to save them by planting huge tracts of forests in gigantic geodesic domes mounted on spacecraft out around Saturn.  Eight years later they decide to destroy all the domes with nuclear bombs and bring the ships back to Earth.  Forget about the insane amount of money and effort it would take to set this up in the first place, forget about leaving the forests in their domes under the care of drones, let's blow them up.  The whole plot makes no sense.But it's as an un-intentional parody of an environmental fanatic that Bruce Dern, as Freeman Lowell, really shines in this movie.  Start out with the sacharine sweet scene of 'ol martyr Lowell in white robes hoeing his garden and feeding Mr. Friendly rabbit to the strains of a Joan Baez tune to open the movie and you know all you need to know about where this flick is going.  Gee, does it have a message?And I dare anyone not to laugh after watching sanctimoniuos Lowell arguing with his shipmates, then stalking off to one of the domes in a huff in his white robe and, get this, when he gets there, he raises his hand and an eagle lands on it.  I horked soda out of my nose on that scene, it was so unbelievably funny.Yet somehow Bruce as Lowell also portrays the selfish environmental movement perfectly.  Lowell kills his shipmates to save the trees.  Rich Western environmentalists discover that DDT if used indiscriminately is bad for birds and ban it in all it's uses, thus consigning millions upon millions of poor Africans and Asians to horrible death by malaria over the next 40 years.  Millions of dead people, but at least rich environmentalists can go on eco-tours and see all the pretty plumage on the parrots.  Yeah, there's a message there.And when good 'ol Lowell flees and can't figure out why his forest is dying, it's almost too good to be true.  Showing the bone-headedness of a truly committed environmentalist, he can't figure out that running away from the sun means less light, and less light means dead plants.To it's credit, there are some cool things about this movie.  The set, the special effects (in 1971 no less) and the drones are totally cool.  If you can forget the heavy-handed ""message"", the middle of the movie is pretty good, especially Lowell's reprogramming of the drones to save his sanity and the ship after running through Saturn's rings.And it ends well, sort of.  Lowell blows himself up, martyr to the end, rather than going back to Earth, and the last geodesic dome slides off into space with it's forest under the care of one of the drones.  So at least somewhere out there, Mr, Friendly Rabbit still eats Lowell's crops to the strains of sanctimonious Joan Baez tunes.",N/A

988198,"This dramatic tale unfolds with an incoherant converstation at a dinner table where it can be assumed that one of the boys has just come out to his family. His father errupts in anger and then whisks the two boys off into his mini-van in the pouring rain only to have an accident that claimes the life of one of his sons. It is a dramatic introduction to the life of Pip, a runaway teen who picks up a couple of oddball friendships along his own path of growing up in hard times.This film is drenched with depressing undertones. And it all seems to come together (despite bing two seperate stories) through the narration provided by Sir Ian McKellen, who plays Pips grandfather. He tells of an experience during World War II that made him grow into an adult real fast... and that story is woven in throughout Pips own struggles. The back story is facinating and suspenceful, but it isn't as engaging as the ""front and center"" story.Pip befriends a self centered gay hustler named Clark. Clark does not believe in love but a young man has his heart set on him even though Clark seems a little struck by Pip. After a confusing moment between Pip and Clark, Pip leaves and runs into Jenny and some guys. jenny saves his life and his reaction is less than thankful. Still, through his cold attitude, a relationship forms.It is hard to feel sorry for Pip at first because he is so stand off-ish. He is cruel to Clark and in a moment when Jenny needs his support, he is rude and unflinchingly bitter towards her. Still, that takes a turn when he finaly meets with the priest who has had short run-ins with him before. It is during a meal with the priest that the truth about the accident that killed his brother comes to light and suddenly it makes sense as to why Pip is cold hearted. I have to say that personally, the revelation shocked me and pissed me off... and I'm sure many of viewers will find the moment disturbing and deeply uncomfortable.This film approaches such hard hitting topics like suicide, abortion, homosexuality, rape, and molestation with an edgy approach. After the ""big"" revelation, it was easy to see who the real monster of this film was... and it was easier to feel for Pip as he continued down his dark path. Thankfully, this movie ends on an upbeat note despite being such a downer the rest of the time... although, becuase of the content, I cannot say that it was bad at all.The acting was decent throughout... although I was a little thrown by the forced flamboyance of Clarks character. It seemed like he was wrestling with the material... and it got a little messy. Brendan Fletcher (as a young Jason Anders... Pips Grandfather) makes out the best because he has the juiciest role... a soldier trying to keep himself and a fallen commrade alive... and he is extreemly convincing. Alan Cumming is also a standout as the priest because he has a couple good lines about priests and molestaion... and the misconceptions that happen because of a few ""bad"" men.Overall, a really good movie. It is dramatic and emotionally charged... and it has some disturbing content. It opened my eyes a little bit... and shed light on a world I hope no child has to really endure.",N/A
856178,"This is an extremely energetic, upbeat tape.  Every time I have done it, I cannot deny how much this workout made me sweat and made my heart pump like crazy.  However, having studied kundalini rather extensively, I think Gurmukh's approach is free form to a point of almost being physically dangerous.  I have danced for years and believe that before odd hopping sequences are introduced, there are many more important kundalini movements which a newcomer should witness first.  On one hand, there is a beautiful totality to her entire pattern, but if one wants to prevent achilles' tendon injuries, I would suggest replacing her hopping and punching with running and punching or even marching and punching.  Also, Gurmukh could have added another dimension to this set by including some held poses with breath of fire, like wheel, for example.  A good workout ought to be a compromise between such extreme action and geometric or methodical asana.  Kundalini yoga possesses all these components and Gurmukh had a responsibility to create a more well rounded sequence with better explanation than she did.  Before running to Gurmukh, I would suggest Ravi Singh and Ana Brett, Donna Davidge, or Erin Kamler first.",N/A
166042,"Some of you may know that director John Avildsen was fired from the legendary ""Saturday Night Fever"" (1977). Amongst other things, he found the content of it too disturbing. We must not write him off as a weak man because of this. The eventual director (John Badham whom I respect very much for his ""Saturday Night Fever"" 1977 and ""Dracula"" 1979) was to encounter his own problems. After the completion of ""Saturday Night Fever"" (1977), John Badham took another job and was fired. The reason was that some suits were horrified at the content of ""Saturday Night Fever"" and were frightened that he was going to make their movie just as disturbing. Well, that left the great John Badham free to direct the phenomenal ""Dracula"" (1979). All of that said, back to the subject at hand. Between the great acting, the beautiful scenery, and the profound messages, ""Karate Kid"" really proves that John Avildsen is a great director. The story starts plausible enough with the fatherless Daniel moving from New Jersey to California. (A potentially difficult situation for any young man.) At first, it looks like he will fit in. He later meets the mysterious Myagi. When we first meet Myagi, we will probably write him off as strange. To Dan's misfortune he runs across Johnny and his gang of Cobras. From this point, Daniel's situation has gone from difficult to dangerous. At one point, Daniel's situation grows so dangerous that Johnny's own friend Bobby is repulsed by the actions Johnny takes against Daniel. At this point, Myagi (whom we may have wrote off as strange) comes to Daniel's aid with very effective results. Daniel obviously wants revenge, but Myagi explains that revenge in the traditional sense does not lead to the desired results...Another interesting thing about this is that with a simple passage, Myagi expands the characters of Johnny and his fellow antagoniosts: ""No such thing as bad student...Only bad teacher...Teacher say, student do."" Myagi confronts the 'bad teacher' and finds himself in for yet another chore. He begins to teach Dan karate to prepare him for an upcoming tournament in hopes that the antagonists will come to respect Daniel or at least leave him alone. Another nice thing about this movie is that Myagi (partially through his unusual teachings) helps Daniel to see that karate is not a sport to injure or kill. Rather, it is a way of life. (Most viewers will probably be able to guess what is behind Myagi's teaching style before Daniel does.) One of the most beautiful things about this movie is that without blatantly stating it, Myagi becomes a surrogate father to Daniel. This is close to obvious when Myagi gives Daniel a birthday party and a car. As if this beautiful scene needed anything else Myagi gives him a gentle caution: ""Just remember, a driver's license won't replace brain or eye."" Finally, there is the climactic tournament. Interestingly, Myagi's theory of: ""No such thing as bad student, only bad teacher"" surfaces to a more prevalent level. Bobby is repulsed by a technique his 'bad instructor' wants him to use,  but is too frightened to disobey the 'bad instructor.' Needless to say, Bobby is overcome with remorse when he sees what he has done. Johnny too becomes nervous about what his instructor wants him to do. (In the start of Part 2, the final falling out of Johnny and this 'bad instructor' will be seen.) Perhaps the best thing about this movie is that while violence was an element of how Daniel overcame his dilemma, it was far from the only element. (All those repulsive action movies that glorify in violence and people getting killed could probably learn several lessons from Mr. Myagi.) If you like this movie, be sure to see ""Karate Kid II."" I'll conclude by saying that I will always respect Director John Badham for his ""Saturday Night Fever"" (1977) and ""Dracula"" (1979). And I will always respect Director John Avildsen for his beautiful ""Karate Kid"" (1984).",N/A

Auto Focus gave him a chance to portray a 1960's TV icon, Hogan, in Hogan's Heroes.  The replication of the original cast is a bit eerie.  After all, these actors dress up as German prison guards.  A chill goes down my spine, but Hogan's was a comedy, which made the series kind of a curiosity beyond the silly caricatures of those funny SS guys.  Anyhow, Bob Crane played Hogan for six years and Kinnear badly imitated.

We know about the conference from an eight page summary of the meeting that was in the papers of one of those officials, Martin Luther, from what other attendees said about it before they died, and also from what we know was actually done to implement this ""Final Solution"".  None of the gassings, shootings, executions of all types, forced labor, or medical experimentation happened by chance, well maybe some did, but the majority of the effort were the carryout of the direction began at this meeting in 1942 in a wealthy suburb of Berlin in a villa by a lake.What a chilling film!  It is so bureaucratic that they could be talking about munitions for the war, or supplying soldiers with boots and blankets.  Yet, they are talking about their noxious racial theories and the problems they are having removing the Jews from civil society, housing them, and even killing them in volume.The interpersonal dynamics and especially the techniques of dominance and manipulation used by the leader of the meeting, Reinhard Heydrich, is a stunning depiction of a monster pushing and prodding others into implementing his nightmare by ""choice"".  Everyone has to sign off, but he masterfully anticipates and suppresses any public objection.  This should be used in b-schools everywhere to stimulate discussions in interpersonal dynamics and groupthink.  Of course, the horrible subject matter would probably prevent it being used, because it would be almost impossible to separate the discussion of the interpersonal dynamics from the chilling goal of the meeting.Evil looks so banal and here we see monstrous evil as common as a business meeting at a luxury resort led by a bully and his detail man.

I thought the series ended with Joey looking like the bad guy.  The show should have ended with Joey having a completely new love interest.  Dawson should have told them both to ""you know what"" and go to California and never look back.  Pacey should go back out to sea and date a new girl at every port.  He never seemed like a character that would settle down but then again, maybe that is what Joey deserved.  I hope some day the cast and crew come together for one last movie and straighten this out.",N/A

829280,"For Red Sox fans, 2003 was the year that we finally understood that our world is an evil place.It was the anteroom to 2004's glory. It was purgatory, a furnace of affliction. It was the sum of all our fears. For a moment, when we could not summon the strength to look away from the horror, it seemed that we had descended to hell. Momentarily, Dante was a sportswriter for the Globe, all was darkness, and the unbearable screaming just wouldn't stop.STILL WE BELIEVE follows an endearing coterie of fans through the season of our hopes, one that would end in venerable BoSox fashion by a spectacular sequence of crashing and burning. Grady Little would be exiled to North Carolina, his given name rarely pronounced in New England after his American League Championship Series decision to allow a stubborn Petey to stay on the mound when his arm clearly needed a shower. Dan Shaughnessy would memorably label him 'He Who Shall Not Be Named', a verbal refusal to acknowledge the hapless tool of Satan that he became on that terrible night in the Bronx.It's odd to watch this move again after the Exorcism of  2004, when Evil unexpectedly ambushed those Yankees, the planets shifted in their orbits, and Red Sox Nation had to adjust to the psychological impossibility that we had won it all.One senses the eventual redemption of these hapless 2003 fans, a bright light on the horizon that they themselves could not yet see.We did win it all. Life is worth living.2003, like 1978 and 1986, became one more mile in the Forced March that led us to Paradise.No-mah, now a Dodger, still rocks.Enough said. Let's not think about 2003 any more.","Still, We Believe - The Boston Red Sox Movie"
1039355,"Several SPOILERS here.Well, the ride had to end sometime. JUSTICE LEAGUE UNLIMITED: THE COMPLETE SECOND SEASON is the culminating season to this excellent animated series and serves to put a capper on the DC Animated Universe, which consists of BATMAN: T.A.S., SUPERMAN: T.A.S., BATMAN BEYOND, STATIC SHOCK, and ZETA PROJECT. While the current THE BATMAN and LEGION OF SUPER-HEROES continue the tradition somewhat, these new shows do not follow the same continuity.This ""second"" season is, technically, the third season of JLU (or, even more comprehensively, the fifth season of JUSTICE LEAGUE) as JLU's ""first"" season dvd set actually contains Seasons 1 and 2. Hopefully, that wasn't too confusing to follow. Anyway, this dvd set offers the final 13 episodes in glorious wide screen and continues to showcase lesser lights from its expanded superhero roster (Hawkman in two episodes, the Warlord, Deadman, Green Arrow, the Huntress, etc.) as they are teamed up with several of the original seven founders.Several episodes pay homage to CHALLENGE OF THE SUPERFRIENDS by updating the Legion of Doom, a haphazard collection of supervillains put together to combat the JLU, which then becomes the season's major story arc. Yes, there's even a Hall of Doom here. And, when we aren't privy to Gorilla Grodd and Lex Luthor engaging in power plays as they vie for the leadership of the Legion, we get to see highly diverting, self-contained episodes such as ""Chaos at the Earth's Core"" (I used to collect the Warlord), ""Flash and Substance"" (featuring a Bats/Flash team-up), ""Patriot Act"" (which salutes the Seven Soldiers of Victory and, in a way, resuscitates the defunct Cadmus Project), and ""Far from Home"" (on her 21st birthday, Supergirl, with GL and Green Arrow are transported to the 31st Century and meet the Legion of Super-Heroes).Meanwhile, the superb ""The Great Brain Robbery"" (which has Luthor and Wally swapping minds) is a favorite Legion of Doom episode of mine. The Legion of Doom storyline, by the way, climaxes with the last two episodes, ""Alive"" and ""Destroyer,"" as the writers throw out all the stops and bring back powerhouse villains Brainiac and Darkseid. By the way, the monumental clash between Superman and Darkseid is a must-see.In my opinion, there isn't a lot of bad moments in this season (or in the entire series, come to think of it). Like a reviewer already mentioned, the disappearance of the Martian Manhunter for a significant portion of the season and the somewhat inconclusive resolution to Shayera and GL's often turbulent relationship are two which fall more in the negative category. And whatever happened with Batman and Wonder Woman's flirtations? Also, I wish the Blue Devil or Blue Beetle had been featured in a show (after all, Ted Kord's best bud, Booster Gold, starred in his own episode). On the positive side, the stories and the animation continue to be amazing. The stellar voice actors maintain their high quality work as they consistently add depth and resonance to their characters. Much as the Batman, as voiced by the iconic Kevin Conroy, and the Joker, by the versatile Mark Hamill, have been firmly embedded in my brain, so, too, now, are Michael Rosenbaum's Flash, Phil LaMarr's Jon Stewart, Maria Canal's Hawkgirl, Carl Lumbly's J'onn J'onzz, Susan Eisenberg's Wonder Woman, and Clancy Brown's Lex Luthor. George Newbern ends up being pretty good as the Man of Steel, but I still prefer Tim Daly. Sorry.What started out, innocently enough, in 1992's definitive BATMAN: THE ANIMATED SERIES has, over the course of 14 years, expanded into an animated universe in which so many significant DC costumed players have made an appearance. It's been such a sweet ride. I just want to state that never in my wildest dreams did I expect the JUSTICE LEAGUE (UNLIMITED) to be this good and this addictive. Thinking back, I probably was basing my expectations on the fun but ultimately shallow and juvenile Hanna-Barbera's SUPERFRIENDS. This current reincarnation offers so much more in terms of depth, emotion, story, scope, and creativity. The characters in JL and JLU are multi-layered, have inter-personal exchanges and conflicts, and do change and grow like real people (Hawkgirl being a prime example); the writers (Paul Dini, Bruce Timm, etc.) did such a fantastic job of making the viewers care for their product, the sum of 91 sincerely produced episodes. I'll miss the Justice League on television very, very much. Just thank goodness for dvds, huh?",Justice League Unlimited: Season 2

Well, up to nine times; like the myth of a cat having nine lives and 'Only Sin Deep' (with Lea Thompson) who is forced to keep the wretched face of a 100 year-old sea hag. Eww!

972671,"Kevin Noland makes a fine debut in both writing and directing this colorful, insightful, low-key exploration of the age old Apollonian Dionysian conflict.  For a first film, despite some minor technical glitches (overexposed photography at key moments, a soundtrack that eats the dialogue before it is audible), Noland proves himself a keen observer of life, of philosophy, and of character studies.  He is definitely an artist to watch.Chris McKinley (Joshua Jackson in yet another fine performance) has just finished college and is ending his summer holiday in Spain with only three days before he returns to an important corporate position in the US. He is traveling with two friends, Ryan (Timm Sharp) and Michelle (Ruthanna Hopper) who are lovers, and they end their holiday in Pamplona, Spain just as the festival of the bulls is happening. Chris' backpack is stolen and with it his passport, credit cards, all semblances of civilization..., and he plunges out of despair into the wildness of the running of the bulls.  He meets two important influences: American expatriate bar owner Riccardo who spouts forth 'live for the moment' concepts, and the beautiful and intoxicating  Adela (Leonor Varela) who embodies all that is fascinating about the beauty of Spain.  The four young people set out on a hike to fly fish, carouse, and live with nature, and this excursion into Spain's gorgeous countryside affects the foursome: Ryan and Michelle decide to part ways and Chris and Adela...well, the story has a fine ending!Noland respects the viewer and offers his tale of discovery with minimal dialogue, some terrific music, exciting footage of the running of the bulls and bullfights, and some hallucinogenic views of nature.  Both Joshua Jackson and Leonor Varela light up the screen.  Ruthanna Hopper (Dennis Hopper's daughter) not only acts well, she also has been part of this project since its inception, is one of the producers, and adds a credibility to the story.  So despite the occasional technical flaws, this is a little film of joy, a celebration of discovery the important facts of living.  Grady Harp, May 06",Americano

83781,"Frank Miller's comics don't do much for me, and I generally avoid them. So, Sin City had nothing to actually compare to. It was what it was, as it was. And what there was, was damn cool. I liked the style and the stories. Stark, grim, gritty, desolate. Not the kind of thing I'd watch before going to bed, but reaching down into the viscera and doing some twisting and making you wonder what dark urges and impulses lurk inside yourself. Asking some troubling questions maybe. Very violent, butI'm all for that kind of stuff, and while for others the `comic' connection may be what turns them on, for me it's the revelatory character of it all. That should be sufficient to make it worthwhile for those who, like me, can handle material like the Fables series and Y, but shy back from other graphic stories, like Frank Miller's.My favorite of the stories is `That Yellow Bastard'. To me it's the most poignant and visceral. I'm sure other people have other favorites, but that's cool.  This is one of those flicks that can be a lot of things to a lot of people.

Overall, the fantastic story about a disease from Vietnam compelling people to bite others, which infects others and results in an epidemic in the city, is cheese galore for guys that know how to appreciate b-movie madness. The acting is surprisingly good too, one of the dudes in the movie did an equally excellent job in House of the Edge of the Park a year later.

983734,"I take it upon myself to ignore the critics when it comes to Horror/Fantasy films with vampires and werewolves, for they seem simply unable to enjoy these types of films as anything more than just entertainment.  This second film is more of a continuation from the first, and not so much a sequel, much like ""Kill Bill 2"" picked up where the first film left off.  The difference here is that the filmmakers now have more money to throw around (thanks to the first film being a success), and it can be seen in the sleeker visual effects and huge sets.  But all that would be boring without interesting characters to watch, most notably Kate Beckinsale who is stunning to look at even when she isn't kicking bad guys in the teeth with her platform boots and wearing that now signature wet-leather cat suit shining in the glare of a full moon.  All in all, this is an action-packed Horror/Fantasy film which by the time the credits were rolling had me second guessing every film critic on the planet with a negative opinion.

672165,"This may well be the Verdi Requiem you always waited for; in spite of its almost 40 years of having been recorded, it is only now that it gains legal and therefore more widespread circulation. Thoroughly idiomatic, with a cast the stuff dreams are made of, a marvellous and authentic-souding choir and orchestra. If Karajan's antics and mimics, the maestro ever the grand poseur, annoy or distract  you, turn the telly off and just listen to the sound through a good sound system. The sound is remarkably fresh and proportions or sound planes between soloists, orchestra and chorus well managed. The La Scala orchestra may not be the Berlin Philharmonic -at the time an awe-inspiring virtuoso body of orchestral musicians, but  Karajan still ventured ocasionally out of his Philharmonie to conduct elsewehere and other ensembles, his love affair with the Dresden orchestra is well documented- but they were long accustomed to the maestro's ways (they had often worked together since the war and through the 1950's and 1960's) and their enthusiasm and commitment do compensate for their lack of finesse -again, compared to the berliners of the time, I don't want to imply they play sloppily or inaccurately, nothing of the sort, they may well have been, and by far, Italy's best orchestra at the time-. The vocal quartet is beyond belief and has been sufficiently praised in these pages by others.There was criticism in the press at the time of the concert this film was connected to about Karajan's overly theatrical approach, but in a way the work calls for it, Toscanini being the obvious model. Southern european warmth and commitment, roman catholic awe before the inevitability of death ot the ever announced day of wrath and a musical setting much imbued of the pomp and circumstance the Vatican Council would do away with a century later? That is the cultural environment the performance takes place in, the performance inheritance Karajan and his musicians performed under, barely three years after Vatican II strongly frowned upon the liturgical context Verdi wrote for, regardles of whether you think this Requiem better suits the church or the theatre. In some way or another, most of the great recordings of the work throughout the 20th century are closely associated with italians or roman catholics (Toscanini, De  Sabata, Serafin, Abbado, Muti), practising or not but definitely bred and raised within a solid roman catholic conception of what a Requiem Mass is about and what it means. Does the work prove elusive to non-catholics then? Perhaps, but Karajan extracts wonders from his performers, Price and Cossotto the undoubted stars of the event. The would-be Parma footballer, Luciano Pavarotti, (thank God he exchanged the ball for the voice) is hard to recognise without his familiar beard and (for his later standards) slenderness, rendering a Kyrie and an Ingemisco that announce why he was starting to make a lot of noise in italian musical circles (and proves Karajan's hindsight as regards promising singers), Ghiaurov was by then an established figure, sought by all great houses on both sides of the Atlantic.There is no way for me to sufficiently praise this recording. There are visual flaws as the work was studio-recorded to a large extent (if not in its entirety, there's no way to tell accurately) and the sound later dubbed in onto the image, which of course allowed Karajan to concentrate substantial film time on his image, gesturing and playing the mesmeriser to orchestra, soloists and chorus before an absent audience. He was, as I said above, a grand poseur but no doubt a fabulously equipped musician, to borrow  somewhat from Harold Schonberg's remark on Bruno Walter, as this Verdi Requiem recording amply proves.Full 1960's glamour then, weird female hairdos and all, all fully dressed up in full gala costumes for a truly memorable experience.",Verdi - Requiem / Henri-Georges Clouzot · Herbert von Karajan - L.

234537,"I saw the original version about 12 years ago, I remember my first thoughts were 'what a brick', but being a diehard and hardcore sci-fi fan I did like the movie.Now I just got the Director's cut, I have not seen the movie since the first time and my thought now is that is better than I remembered, sometimes masterful. The only 'drawback' if you can call it that, is that sometimes the movie also shows the student approach that Lucas still had in that time.Anyway, neither two versions are for casual viewers who just want popcorn and kill time, this work demands serious attention, there is no villain but the social system itself and dialogue can be misleading sometimes requiring fast analysis from the viewer. Surprisingly there is a long action-chase scene towards the end, very well edited, and the final is striking. The musical score is astounding, minimalist in some passages, grandiose in others. OK Computer fans will be very pleased with the tone and theme of this movie, while a lot of people (even some Star Wars fans) will be alienated and attacked by its intrinsec social criticism, surely one of the reasons of the film's failure.I don't feel that the CGI additions damage the film, instead they make it more comtemporary  but I insist that it would be wise from DVD companies to include the original version in these editions for the people that prefer it, a few extra bucks don't matter. Nevertheless I feel that the bashing of this new version by some reviewers is extreme and exagerated.The documentals included are worth watching, Coppola, Lucas, Scorsesee, Spielberg and other film makers remembering the times and sharing their insights of the movie. While seeing the movie I thought, 'hmm, Blade Runner is very influenced by this', then to my pleasant susprise, Spielberg in a documental, says the same thing!Overall, in many ways the most mature film done by Lucas (I do not mean to demerit his other movies), that ironanically was his first work.

327023,"The return of an old enemy, the threat of annihilation of all life on Earth, and actual  death of a compianion, Earthshock finds the 5th and youngest Doctor, PETER DAVISON at his best in this 4 parter. He displays the same short temper and irritable nature as his first incarnation along with the humanity and vulnerability of the 2nd Doctor. This excellent 19th season story arc contains one of the most emotionally powerful finale in the show's original 26-year run. A scientific expedition in a cave system on 25th-century Earth is wiped out. An military rescue unit led by Lieutenant Scott (James Warwick) and sole expedition survivor Professor Kyle (Claire Clifford) go in to recover the bodies following a mysterious massacre, developing into tense action on a space freighter bound for Earth carrying a deadly cargo of Cybermen, absent from the series for 7 years (since Tom Baker's first season ( ""Revenge of the Cybermen""). At the time the return was kept fair  secret, as death of a regular character, by the time it aired in the US, both cats were out of the bag (which made the ""near misses""  even more effective than your usual Dr. Who story).With a moody dark mood remnisent of the movie ALIEN, and WITH action & Tight-pacing reminiscent of the movie ALIENS (which it predates), doesn't lead time to include some of the camp-moments sometimes blighting the series in the `80s, and with a notable, but over-the-top guest turn from Beryl Reid as the ship's captain, Earthshock is one of the 5th Doctor's finest adventures (along with ""Caves of Androzani""). Another problem of the 5th Doctors run is neatly solved, on many levels, the overfull TARDIS crew. Nyssa (and some guest-stars) being sidelined in the TARDIS for half of this very story since there is nothing for her to do illustrates why one companion had to go, and I think that the killing off of a companion was a bold and brilliant move by producer JNT. It defies reason, even in a fantasy series to have the Doctor's companions all survive and for them to be victorious in every episode. Plus, as the character everybody (at the time) loved to hate does die, in so heroic a fashion, it  redeems his irksome character ( an infinitely superior end compared to sparing Westley Crusher in ST:TNG).The story is first-class enough to overlook a few plot holes and by the end they simply won't matter; when the final credits roll in silence the effect is as powerful now as it was shocking to audiences back in 1981. The ending is brilliant. It's shocking, it's moving; it's just fantastic. The credits roll silently over Adric's destroyed badge, and you realise that the Doctor doesn't always win, and it makes you love him even more. From this point on in the fifth Doctor's era, there is the feeling that no one is safe...Doctor Who: Earthshock is presented in the original broadcast with a near-flawless picture. The extras begin with a strong 32-minute documentary, more retrospective than making-of. Then comes the commentary, with the complete TARDIS crew!:Peter Davison, Janet Fielding (Tegan), Sarah Sutton (Nyssa) and Matthew Waterhouse (Adric). It is much better than the Visitation commentary, although only Davison seems to know what his talking about, while the other cast members seem to remember very little, with Fielding enthralled by the fashion aspects of the crew. Both commentary and the episodes have optional subtitles. The documentary, ""Putting the `Shock' Into Earthshock"" is one of the most interesting produced thus far, featuring contributions from the cast & director Peter Grimwade, writer Eric Saward, Mark Gatiss, Steve Moffatt and others. Other special feature options include detailed on-screen information subtitles, an isolated musical score, and the ability to watch Earthshock with the original FX or with selected effects shots replaced with new computer graphics (don't worry it is very subtle but very effective, perfect for showing to someone who started watching in 2005). There's a scored, five-minute photo gallery that even includes a shot from the recording of the commentary, assemblage of footage shot on film and a 10-minute section ""Did You See?"" which looks back on the 40 year-old show's aliens.There are DVD 'Easter Eggs,' if you navigate down to the special features option on the first menu and press select, then move down to the 40th Anniversary Celebration option and hit left to highlight a hidden Doctor Who logo then hit select, you'll get a comedy sketch featuring a short clip from ""Earthshock"" that's been dubbed.Possible DW drinking games: (drink when you see the following cliches or counter-cliches)-The  TARDIS Crew are Accused / Arrested (for murder)-The TARDIS Crew return / plan to return to the TARDIS-Threats & near misses on TARDIS Crew-Emotionless Cybermen showing emotion-The Doctor kills-ADRIC complains",Doctor Who - Earthshock VHS

Bruce Willis is no longer the most hamfisted actor on film. Point is, given the trajectory of his films since I see dead people, you could make the argument that MNS can barely craft a screenplay let alone direct.

Wolfen really caught New York during 1980-1981,the big apple was some what different then. This film eerily catches the Bronx in a cold septic view. Wolfen made you very aware of the sociol class, poverty and drug problems of America during the early 1980s. The soundtrack by James Horner is simply awesome. In my opinion Wolfen was the best of the wolf movies of the early 1980s. They dont make movies like this anymore. This was Michael Wadleighs last film but really a well directed film with some interesting actors and charachters. Wolfen does have some political views as well as regarding mans technology against natures, and the treatment of the American Indian and thier connection to the wolf. Albert Finney plays an excellent NYPD detective. The late Gregory Hines an excellent pathologist. Veteran actor Dick O'neil plays a believable NYPD Captain. Diana Venora whatever became of Diane, but her charachter was really interesting to. This film also supplies some great landscape shots as well. People will have different views of Wolfen,but in all very entertaining. Take out of ""Wolfen"" what you will. ""Wolfen knows all, there could be no lying"". Michael Wadliegh and his crew do an awesome job with a steadicam and a louma crane capturing the predators prospective. A very well crafted film with some ambiguity.......",N/A
380314,"Each entry in this series attempts to create something unique. The original had momma doing the killing. The sequel introduced the man, the myth, the legend himself. Part 3 had the 3D gimmick. Part 4 had Senior Voorhees being offed by a 10 year old. Part 5 had the copy cat killer. Part 6 had the resurrection (unlike the other movies, he was actually buried). Part 7 had the ""Carrie"" copy cat. Part 8 took us out of the woods and into the city which brings us to Jason Goes To Hell. This movie shows us Jason the body hopper and hints at his eventual pairing with another horror movie icon from the '80s.The movie opens with Jason stalking another screaming female through the woods ready to do what he does best. Ah but not this time oh Minister of Death. The unsuspecting Jason has been lured into a trap and 3 minutes into the movie, he's blown to smithereens. Case closed, everyone can go home. Not so fast. In the words of the great James Brown, ""Jason's got a brand new bag"". You see, destroying his body barely slows him down. The heart still pumps and apparently looks quite appetizing to one particular person who's performing an autopsy as he takes a huge chomp on the Lord of Lethal's heart. That chomp turns into one huge overgrown leech that inhabits the body of anyone within arms distance. Once the parasitic Jason has used a body to its full potential, it finds someone else to act as host. All of this is learned by the exboyfriend (ex husband maybe, I don't know) of a member of the Voorhees family (and the way he was informed was quite painful). It turns out that Jason will need to continue swapping bodies until he can get into the body of a family member. In this movie, there are 3. A mom, her daughter and the daughter's child. Because of his body swapping ways, the characters in the movie have a hard time determining which body is carrying Jason (though it's something the audience can easily discern because the hosts all act like lumbering zombies from ""Night Of The Living Dead). We get to see Dr. Voorhees and Officer Voorhees amongst other hosts.While I do enjoy this movie, it's been a while since I've seen it and oddly enough, I don't remember any of the kills so they must not have been too impressive. Also if I'm not mistaken, this is the only movie in which Jason is the murderer where we don't get to see his face. That's one of the things fans of this series have come to expect. Did they run out of ideas? Another thing I didn't like is once Jason actually finds one of the 3 family members, he enters her in a rather tasteless way. The movie makes up for it once the inevitable Jason death occurs. The way the death occurs isn't anything new but the effects are pretty good and then we see the great submerging of Jason and the legendary submerging of the famed hockey mask.Overall: Good edition to the series.",N/A
21312,"The narrative of Robert Redford is captivating, uplifting, and graceful.  'On the banks of the Big Blackfoot River....' a place I've been, and long to return.  Nothing, el zippo, tops the splendor and majesty of Montana, nothing even comes close!  It's timeless valleys, raging aqua-tinted torrents, and green alpine towns and villages dispersed all throughout its western landscapes define 'National Treasure.'  Missoula, Montana, home to the Maclean family, is a good old fashioned town of turmoil and unsetteldness squaring off against an unmistakable serenity with nature's works and ways.  'To the beat of a four count rhythm....' might not be the most instructive of flyfishing casting approaches (I've lost many a woolybugger in willow trees climbable only by the most inane of flytiers), but it makes for undulating cinema.  'Oh I could never leave Montana brother...' is a line beckoning truth; after visiting Montana on several occasions (first was an Amtrack train ride in '94... ok a person could easily get up and go from Havre, MT) getting to catch sights of Glacier to the north, the Bitterroot range in the south, and all that lies in between (e.g. Flathead Lake)....there are no fleeting instincts.  A geologist could be lost in paradise in, say, Yellowstone for ages, not even taking into consideration the abundance of mountain ranges lining Montana's western front - stretching north to south, from Great Falls to Anaconda.  Redford's directing brings along the viewer through every imaginable trace of landmark - riverbanks, pubs, train stations, backyard fields with forest and mountain top afar, and even a couple sunburned rawhides!  Not a favorite still shot.  Boats are stolen, category 'forget about it' white waters are paddled through, unpaid gambling wagers bring conflict wrought with misunderstanding, dinner table discussions of Calvin Coolidge's fishing secret '...what are they bitin on?....The end of my line!' and job satisfaction are brought up, shortcuts winding their way through train tunnels are taken, and in the end, reflection and memories are revealed in honest fashion.  Verdant pastures and picueresque backdrops steal the film's premise, offering more than just basic storyline.  But the moment of closure is why I adore Robert Redford's film set in Missoula....in addition to the melancholic violin intermezzos.'On some of the rocks are timeless raindrops. Under the rocks are the words, and some of the words are theirs. I am haunted by waters.'Anyone ever visiting Montana will register in their sights and other senses this inescapable impression.  Don't forget, if you're going to fish these pristine waters (i.e. Yellowstone, Clearwater Creek, Madison, Bighorn, Big Hole, Gallatin, Beaverhead, Kootenai Rivers), catch-and-release is the only real keeper!  A River Runs Through It is a Montana dreamscape.  Once more, if going there, remember to 'Enjoy the Silence.'",A River Runs Through It

1004878,"Well, I have read the other reviews boasting of picture quality, and purchased my own copy. My copy of the GOODTIME version of MUNSTER, GO HOME! was actually very good. But this new release is roughly a 30-35% improvement over the GOODTIME release. However the lack of scene selection is somewhat annoying. I never purchased the original dvd of MUNSTERS' REVENGE so I can't compare dvds to that, but I have a recorded from cable VHS copy that I thought looked ok. But when compared to this, it looks downright dreadful. Munsters' Revenge may not be as good a movie as Munster,Go Home.But niether one comes close to the TV Series. I have a theory as to why Pat Priest was not included in the Munster, Go Home cast. First of all had Pat been in the movie, they would have to recast Robert Pine's role because Robert Pine (Roger Morseby) would not have been a convincing suitor for Pat Priest. Also when Squire Morseby and his wife (Roger's Parents) expressed their intolerance for the Munsters, Pat Priest's Marilyn would have stood her ground better and convinced the Squire and his wife that the Colonial Munsters were nothing like their British counterparts. Therefore diminishing the intended subplot of Marilyn and Roger at odds with each other. Money was paid, locations rented, and a cast ready to go. This movie was rushed into production. Had they been able to wait a little longer we probably would have had a better Munster's movie that included Pat Priest.","The Munsters: Two-Movie Fright Fest (Munster, Go Home! & The Munsters' Revenge)"

The last few seconds of the movie made an unexpecting ending but it was better than the ending the filmmaker's shot first.  (To see the alternate ending choose the choose their fate version and select Step right on Ian's death scene.  I recommend watching the actuall movie first though.)If you only watch a horror movie only for gory goodness or mainly for the gory goodness you are in luck.  Gruesome deaths await in the film as you begin to watch.Somehow the first two FDs were linked together as survivors from the first show up in the second but no FD2 survivors show up here.  Through other reviews I heard that a fourth FD movie is in the works but lets hope it doesn't suck.The choose their fate option of the movie I thought was a great addition in the DVD although it is just an alternative version in points but if you wish to control their fate it is a good option but like I said earlier watch the actuall movie first.To explain things in the horror genre and to explain such movies as Friday The 13th, Nightmare on elm street, Final Destination, The Texas Chainsaw Massacare etc. there is a featurette included on the second disc.  ""Dead Teenager Movie"".  Why are teens victems in horror movies?  Why do filmmakers make movies like these?  These questions and more are answered in  the featurette.A bonus short ""It's all around you"" included on Disc two as well explains the odds of dying in certain ways and etc.  Also on Disc 2 is the bonus goodness like other materials.Overall FD3 is a worthy addition in the franchise.

1023384,"Superman returns after abandoning the earth for 5 years.  Upon his return, he saves a huge passenger jet from crashing.  Of course!  Superman was absent during 9-11!  This well-done action sequence is a poignant wish that Superman could have helped us on that day.  Where was he when we needed him?Two Jews invented Superman in the 1930's to fight the Nazi menace.  The new Superman is clearly a Christian product.  Superman dies; a Kryptonite blade stabbed into his side helps to finish him off.  He is resurrected to fight- but to fight what?  Perhaps for our souls.  This Superman is no super hero- he is a super savior.  Villain Lex Luthor calls himself Prometheus, the human savior in Greek myth.  So, this film is in the tradition of Godzilla versus King Kong: now, it is Prometheus versus Jesus.I saw the film in IMAX 3-D, and there is much to enjoy to see.  However, the 3-D sequences often look cheesy, and the action grinds on.  There are many fine details to savor, to enjoy, and to discuss, nevertheless.There is terrible news for sophisticated Superman lovers, however.  Superman is resurrected, but Clark Kent is dead.  In Superman II, Superman gave up his powers so that Lois Lane could love him as Clark Kent.  The point was: anyone can love Superman, but who can love Clark Kent?  Superman realized in that great film that his human love could not be, and he accepted his isolated fate.In 'Returns', Superman himself becomes vulnerable.  Lois Lane rescues him, and resurrects him with a kiss.  Superman thus becomes indistinguishable from Neo, the  hero in the Matrix.  Superman loses his true identity- which is as Clark Kent.Clark plays almost no role in this well done, but emotionally routine action flick.  The unique Clark-Supie tension is absent.  Now that Superman is 'vulnerable', and wishes only to be a family man, there is no need for Clark to represent what Superman can never be.The passengers in the jet plane that Superman saved gave him a fascist salute in thanks.  Astounding!  They were correct, however.  Superman now represents the merely charismatic perfection that we wish to attribute to political leaders and rock stars.",N/A

496109,"I was born in the 70's but it was only recently (a couple of days ago) that I saw the film Superfly.  A film about a drug dealer who wants to retire from the cocaine business because he sees its fatalism.  I guess I must have bought into the negativity of those who condemned the film for its perceived glorification of street life.  In reality,  I didn't even know what the film was about, I simply discounted it as just another blaxploitation that would be filled with over the top characters and bad acting. But Superfly was none of what I expected.  It's social commentary speaks to the hopelessness of such a life style and if anything offers an anti-drug message.  It also speaks to what society tells us to revere-money, homes, cars-the American Dream. Unfortunately, people could not see beyond the flashy clothes and the melodic musical score, which serves as the narrator, and controversy to capture the real message of the film.  It is also unfortunate that the late Ron O'Neal's mesmerizing and brilliant performance as Priest was somewhat overshadowed by the film's controversy-namely, a drug dealer as hero. Ron O'Neal was a victim of what happens to most actors who have monumental success on a film-oftentimes they are typecast and then resigned to film and television roles that are beneath their talent and ability-it happens to the best of actors and the worst.  Had he been an actor just starting out in present times, with his exotic, smoldering good looks and immense talent and intensity, he would have become world renown and Oscar nominated and perhaps an Oscar winner.  He was definitely underrated and a man ahead of his time.Although obviously low budget, Superfly IS a very good film. Curtis Mayfield's haunting soundtrack coupled with Ron O'Neal's hypnotic performance definitely makes this a must see film. And although it is included in the blaxploitation genre, Superfly is a film that deserves to stand on its own.",N/A

559074,"The first half hour of this 90 minute movie is actually quite good.  In fact, it is enthralling and has an interesting twist in that we don't know the real fact behind whether a young woman was violated by her boyfriend while unconscious.  According to the rumor (the rumor being a school experiment conducted by three roommates) she was, however, but we the audience don't know that.  However, the young woman is quick to think she has been raped.  Why there is no attempt at a physical exam, is unexplained, especially since the young woman involved has the reputation of being a professional virgin, however it turns out she isn't, so that's why the movie lasts longer than 30 minutes.  Fortunately, we're not dealing with unwanted pregnancies, either, so this doesn't turn into a soap opera.  However, we do have the dreamboat ""hero"" who dreams up the rumor about her being raped, and who exhibits unlikeable traits throughout. But that's true of the three leads - the roommates are all unlikeable, being insufferably full of themselves.  The last half of the film, 'dreamboat' takes the turn as lead character, and it's his story we're following, whereas his female roommate had the first half of the film, and basically it's her introduction to the audience of all the characters. Turns out 'dreamboat' and the young woman victim have a history together; which means issues they have to work out, and everyone else (in a way, the entire student body and its faculty and local law enforcement) is sucked into their story and mutual thirst for truth, though the characters don't have the same truth in mind - it's about vengeance; not justice.  And vengeance when it's not the comic book variety, isn't fun for an audience, it's just distasteful.  In other words, the man and woman should have been shut up together in a room so they could have worked it out for themselves, and left the rest of us alone.  So from a brilliant first half-hour - and btw how does the roommate penniless art student have the dollars for all that tech equipment? - we degenerate into a constantly weaving pattern of lies and deceptions that seems more pointless than clever.  There is merely too much story, so it becomes ridiculous.  A basically good premise is ruined.  If you are a fan of any of the stars involved, it might be worth viewing, if only once, but the film as a whole will probably leave a vile taste in your mouth.  Perhaps that's the ultimate message on a film about the dangers of spreading GOSSIP, or in this case deliberate lies, is that what goes around comes around, and also it will leave you feeling sick to your stomach.  I almost recommend you watch the first 30-45 min then quit midway, but anyone will watch all the way thru at least once, just to be sure where this is headed.",N/A
852704,"Though it was made in Germany, ""Downfall,"" the story of Hitler's last 15 days on Earth, it is pure Hollywood both in execution and tone....more television special mini-series than serious work of art.With that said, the central story of Hitler's last days in the bunker with Himmler, Eva Braun, Goebbels, Eva Braun and his secretary, Traudl Junge (the real Junge appeared in her own documentary, ""Blind Spot"" her recollection of her time with Hitler and Eva in the Bunker) and assorted others is so fascinating that it is impossible to avert your eyes from the screen.Director Oliver Hirschbiegel  and his production designer fill the screen with eye-popping, though not particularly sophisticated detail: the dark, claustrophobic bunker with Hitler (a dynamic Bruno Ganz) slowly losing control of his kingdom while his army and ss officers celebrate with the best French champagne and Russian caviar that recalls Nero fiddling while Rome burned.Ganz appropriately chews the scenery with his crazy, ranting portrayal of Hitler on the one hand: been there, seen that. But Hirschbiegel shows a more human, tender Hitler: his warm relationship with Eva, who he marries while in the bunker (the person officiating at the wedding asks Hitler is he is 100% Aryan...a part of the official 3rd Reich wedding ceremony...funny) before he shoots and poisons her as well as his special relationship with his German shepherd, Blondi whom he also poisons. Does this do much to humanize Hitler, arguably the most hated man of the 20th Century? Not really but it does add positive texture to a life that most of us know so very little about. ""Downfall"" merely and I think naively points out that we are all capable of Evil.Bruno Ganz excels when he digs beneath the surface and adds the little touches that humanize Hitler. He punctuates his performance with small details: the pushing back behind his ear of his unruly, straight, pomaded hair, the twitching of his left hand, which he holds behind him so as not to appear weak or sick in front of his officers and Ganz's use of his huge, bloodhound-like eyes to reflect and divert what is going on in his incredible, insane mind.""Downfall"" is an interesting, diverting film: at times silly and melodramatic; at others...fascinating and enthralling. Ganz's performance makes it a must see.",Der Untergang

822521,"I understand that Dirty Dancing movies aren't going to be exactly like Citizen Kain.  But when you think about the premise, the culture and classist clash of American vs. Cuban dancing, sexuality, and budding romance set during the backdrop of the Revolution, the movie sounds quite promising.  I mean, when I heard the premise I thought ""This movie was MADE for me,"" because it has Cuban history and politics, awesome dancing (or so I assumed it would, due to its predecessor,) and, come on, the main character has the same name as me.  But I should have realized then that a good premise does not necessarily lead to a good, or even adequate, execution.I won't summarize the movie as so many others do; if you want a synopsis, look to their reviews.  I WILL point out what exactly I found so lacking about it, and why I do not feel it was that good of a movie, even when one considers that it's ultimately just a dance movie.  But again one must remember that it was their decision to involve politics in the movie, and in doing so they made themselves fair game--I do not believe in just using a deep political situation just to make a story line seem a little deeper; if it is not handled properly, it is insulting.First off, the romance.  Diego Luna and Romola Garai had definite chemistry, and it is so disappointing when you realize that the movie did not capitalize upon this, and all you're going to see in addition to some very sexually charged dancing is a few hurried onscreen kisses and an implied sex scene.  Given their chemistry and the buildup of their relationship, their first kiss could have been so much better, instead of just snuck in during a dance routine--it was so quick I spent many minutes wondering if I had really seen it or not.  However, to me chemistry is not the only thing required in an on-screen relationship, and I have no idea to this minute why Javier and Katey fell in love with each other.  Katey's personality was developed in the movie sense (she likes classic literature, is a bookworm and rather progressive for her time) and Javier was clearly the ""will do anything for his family and feels that Cuba is in need of a change"" but I don't really know how those two fit together.  Aside from the sexual attraction component, I have no idea what exactly they saw in each other to make their relationship anything more than ""He was hot, she was pretty, and she felt sorry for him.""  Some might argue that Katey was merely attracted to the intensity and freedom of the Cuban lifestyle embodied by Javier, but I ask you: the movie was founded upon the idea of a romance, and what the heck kind of relationship is that?I would also like to add that the Spanish conversations WITHOUT subtitles were incredibly rude to the audience.  I do speak Spanish, but I could not make much sense of the slurred words and to this day I am wondering what exactly Javier and his brother said to each other after the Revolution broke out.  Maybe they figured that the audience would not care (pfft, what are politics compared to SALSA DANCING,) but I cared.And now, the historical components.  I will not get into the anachronisms--such as Katey's parents' attitude towards her staying nights with a boy they don't know, and that even Cuba in the 50's could not have been that unrestrained--as there are many who could do that better justice than I (apparently the style of dancing in the movie was unlike what was popular in Cuba at the time.)  After all, it is only a dance movie.  I can ignore that stuff.  But when the movie brings the history to ME I cannot ignore it, and I further dislike it when movie directors assume that their audience is completely ignorant of certain aspects of history and will just assume that ""Man, that Batista guy was a jerk; he didn't allow dancing.  Hopefully life will be better under this new regime!  Who'd they say it was, some guy by the name of Fidel Something-or-Another?"" (I am exaggerating; at least I hope that no one is that ignorant.)And here we get to the backdrop of the story, Revolutionary Cuba.  First off, Batista's regime wasn't really shown to be that bad; aside from the story involving Javier's father, it might as well have been that town in Footloose (perhaps a little more violent.)  It was like Dictatorship Lite.  After Havana falls to Castro and co., the Cubans act happy (which is understandable) but things are otherwise pretty calm, which one cannot imagine is really likely in such a situation.And then we get to the ending.  Katey asks Javier to come to America with her.  In a move which my sister has deemed the ""stupidest decision in a movie ever,"" Javier refuses, saying that he has to stay because of the Revolution, which he believes (or wants to believe, anyway) will improve life for him and his people, Batista killed his free-thinking father, viva la Revoluci&oacute;n, yadda yadda yadda.  I understand that movies don't always have happy endings, but I think that there is a middle ground between ""boy and girl live happily ever after"" to ""girl lives happily ever after and boy gets sent to the gulag after he finds out that Castro isn't exactly the nice guy he claims to be and wow, Batista was a cakewalk compared to this, and has to spend his years in a drawer cell where he would kick himself for his earlier decision if, you know, he could actually kick himself, but drawer cells don't allow that.""  I truly think that the filmmakers did not anticipate their audience to think this much, which is understandable, but come on--everyone knows that communist Cuba is no picnic, and when Katey says something along the lines of ""I know that we'll meet again,"" I couldn't help but thinking that the only way THAT would happen would be if Javier braves the Gulf and takes up Florida's wet feet dry feet policy.  In fact, when I told my friend about the ending he said, ""that boy is going to have to stop dancing and learn to convert his '57 Chevy into a boat.""I understand that people at first thought that Castro was fantastic and he didn't reveal his true intentions until later, but the fact remains that Cuba was politically instable and to choose to stay there instead of going to America was still pretty questionable.  And then Katey's optimistic ""We'll see each other again someday!"" was just waaaay too much for me.So, in short, if you're like me and you can't turn off your brain while watching a movie, this one's going to give you a lot of issues.  If you CAN turn off your brain and just enjoy it for what it is--a dance movie--you'll probably like it, though find some things (like the romance) lacking.",Dirty Dancing - Havana Nights
568415,"There was so much hype surrounding ""The Broken Hearts Club"" upon its release that I couldn't wait to see it. It's filled with witty insights (although occasionally I knew what would come out of the character's mouths before they said it) about gay culture & being gay. Unfortunately, writer/director Greg Berlanti chose to populate his film with a roster of gay stereotypes: the lovelorn everyman, the drama queen, the average joe, the shallow pretty boy, etc. But who cares?? As long as those stereotypes are done well. And they are. This film is driven by some wonderful performances. Tim Olyphant is engaging as Dennis, a photographer who's open to love but wary of repeating the mistakes of the past. Dean Cain has the trickiest role: playing a shallow actor who uses scripted lines to break up with the latest boyfriend but manages to be forgiven, simply because he's adorable & unapologetic about himself. THEN his character finds out what it's like to be dumped (by another hunky closeted actor, no less), which adds poignancy & depth to Cain's character. Taylor is the resident drama queen who crows about his LTR--until he gets dumped & goes through some hilarious traumas (during a ""revenge"" phase, he keeps rewinding the most gruesome scene from a Joan Crawford movie in which she decapitates an unfaithful lover & his mistress). ""Scrub's"" Zach Braff plays Benji, the bleach blond twink with a thing for ""gym bunnies"" and falling into the wrong crowd. Adorable Andrew Keegan is Kevin, the ""newbie"" who must takes his lumps on the way to coming out. And ""Frasier's"" John Mahoney plays Jack, the ""father figure"" who dispenses advice to his brood & tries to steer them in the right direction. To make an already long story short, there's many great actors I haven't mentioned here.""Broken Hearts"" is subtitled ""a romantic comedy"", and aptly so. What do straights seek? What do gays seek? LOVE. It's universal, it transcends all boundaries & labels.What keeps this movie from being 5-star statis are the cliches. How many times must we see those mundane musical montages showing the characters dealing with their pain once a character dies?

As you might guess, samurai whupping spaceships and other assorted targets with swords is a little over the top. Bad isn't quite the right word, since the animation's cool -- but the storytelling is often really cheesy, verging into the preposterous (look, a rice farmer might attack an ordinary bandit with a sickle; he probably wouldn't attack one of three 50-foot-tall mecha bandits standing in his field, who kills him with a GIANT SWORD instead of a gun [the robot might, admittedly, ""not want to waste the powder""]).

504451,"Some women want to strangle models, but most people don't actually go that far. That's not the case in ""Blood and Black Lace,""  where models run, scream, and die in all sorts of gruesome ways. Mario Bava's classic giallo has some monotonous moments, but mostly it sticks to stylish slayings.Just before a fashion show, the model Isabella is found dead in a wardrobe. The police investigate the fashion house's various models and managers, but can't find any solid evidence. And during the show, one of the other models finds Isabella's diary, which is loaded with scandalous information about drugs, lovers, abortions, and debts.But then the diary is stolen, and trenchcoated killer waits until the models are alone -- and then he burns, strangles, drowns, and claws them. The police suspect the men -- designers and managers -- at the fashion house, but even detaining the suspects won't stop the gruesome murders...At first glance, ""Blood and Black Lace"" seems like just another bloody slasher movie. Well, giallo is to slasher movies as fine cheese is to Velveeta, and ""Blood and Black Lace"" is a perfect example of a giallo, with the arty lighting, graphic violence, colourful sets, and of course those black gloved hands.The plot is a pretty straightforward whodunnit -- it's not blatantly obvious who the killer is, but seasoned movie fans can probably guess. And while there are gruesome slayings, the killer doesn't just jump out and kill. Bava builds up the tension and fear (which the characters also demonstrate) until it's almost a relief when someone dies.But one of the biggest necessities for a giallo is visual style. The fashion house is lushly palatial, and the murders are elaborately choreographed chases, with weird lighting and lots of luxurious surroundings. The second murder, for instant, is like hide-and-seek in an antiques store. The only problem is a misogynistic edge, such as when the women have their shirts ripped halfway off.None of the characters really stand out much -- they're the Models, the Creepy Boyfriends, the Skeptical Police, the Weird Landlady, and a handful of others. So it's a credit to the actresses like Mary Arden and Eva Bartok that they are able to make us feel sorry for their characters.""Blood and Black Lace"" is a beautiful, bloody guilty pleasure, and a perfect example of a giallo horror movie.

765180,"It is very hard to pigeonhole this movie.  In it there is lots of smoking, use of drugs, teen sex, and nudity, including fully shown bodies.  At the same time it is an entertaining and even suspenseful move, and there are so many good issues to discuss with teens that it excels in that area for traditional values parents.Kati and her family are shown praying three times, and from the pictures in the home one would conclude that she is Catholic.  One issue for families to discuss with their teens is Steffi's anger at her father's infidelity, and especially her vengeance toward the woman's family.  Kati begins to question her friendship with Steffi when she is willing to take her anger out on the woman's innocent daughter, Tessa.  Parents might wish to discuss if that is at all fair.  Another interesting quality to discuss is the fact that things don't always go as planned; in this case, what Steffi thought would be just a mean prank turned into a life and death situation.  Parents might also wish to discuss Steffi's attempted suicide and how she might have been able to better handle the feelings that made her think it was an option.  A few other issues include using someone's boyfriend, especially sexually, in anger against that person.  Dating older guys is another issue parents can discuss and talk about how the girls were put into situations beyond their maturity.There is a lot in this movie that traditional values families would object to, but there are so many issues to discuss with their kids I think the movie is well worth showing to mid to older teens if parents are willing to discuss the movie with them.",N/A

777806,"I write this review mainly to react on a kind of comment I often here but never realy get. It's the standard comment that a a book, a movie or a video, how skillfully crafted or how originally conceived in the beginning, is never really good when there is no real story line. Apparently there must be a tale to be told, going from A to B and ending with Z. (And if you are Christopher Nolan or David Lynch your stories may go from B to D to Y and ending with J or something. But, at the end, a lot of people keep on saying: ""there must be a narrative"".)Why? I ask. What is wrong with a single image? I mean look at American painter Edward Hopper, to me the greatest artist of all: He haunts us with scenes of alienation and loneliness that stick, that haunts and reflects. Cetain photographers win World Press Photo Awards for capturing big events in one single shot, or: one single blink of the eye. Of course, the pictures created carry with them loads of tales and history, otherwise the pictures wouldn't have been taken in the first place.Now here we have a video artist, Chris Cunningham, whose work we now can admire on one disc: Eight video's which presents us with nightmarish worlds in anonymous urban landscapes (Leftfield's ""Afrika Shox"" and Aphex Twins' ""Come to daddy"" and ""Windowlicker""), nameless deserts (Madonna's ""Frozen""), surreal Japanese lunybins for deranged kiddies (Squarepusher's ""Come to my selector"") and a static white room where futuristic robo-intelligence is perfectly combined with claustrophobic erotisism (Bj&#65533;rk's ""All is full of love""). All of these worlds presented here have a kind of autism, in the sense of `being in it's own world'.So following this comment I conclude that Cunningham makes Art For The Sake Of Art. (the original Frensh slogan for this kind of work of course, by the way, is: l'Art pour l'art).These video's are sometimes scary as in the case of the menacing bunch of ever-grinning gettho-midges in ""Come to daddy"", but at the same time, drenched in a juicy sause of oozing black humour. The same can be said about ""Afrika Shock"" in which a psychotic black guy wanders the streets without anyone reaching out for him, literaly losing his limbs one at the time. Creepy, otherworldy and yet filled with moments for sickening laughs: We don't know whether to be seriously shocked or secretly amused, as with the best works of Kafka.And talking about Kafka, here is one of the best writers in the world, whose real strength to me are still his short pieces of fiction, which are as plotless as Cunninghams visions right here, but which visually stunning, arresting and, at best, are little drops of liquid acid, secreted underneath our eyelids.Story isn't necessary is just what I want to say, when a well crafted portrait, scene, vision or visual prophecy is enough to captivate us, and makes us shiver (or, okay okay, secretly laugh out loud).And we have Cunningham to prove it. So I can now rest my case.",N/A

878280,"BROADWAY TO HOLLYWOOD is Warner Home Video's blanket title for five of the splashiest and most tuneful color MGM musicals ever made:  THE BANDWAGON,  EASTER PARADE, BRIGADOON, BELLS ARE RINGING, and FINIAN'S RAINBOW.Two of these are sleeper gems.  Vincente Minnelli's BRIGADOON (1954), with an army of musical numbers by Lerner and Loewe, has travelers Gene Kelly and Van Johnson coming upon a Scottish village that can only be seen once every hundred years; Cyd Charisse is the lovely leading lady.  The movie has been criticized for its sound stage re-creation of a Scottish village, but that is a plus for me.  Along with CinemaScope, one gets the feel for what this show was like on Broadway.  A dozen songs, choreographed by Kelly, include ""The Heather on the Hill"" and ""It's Almost Like Being in Love.""  BRIGADOON is a lovely movie, with remastered color and sound.  Bonuses include three outtake musical numbers and several original theatrical trailers.Francis Ford Coppola does brand-new audio commentary on his own fabulous FINIAN'S RAINBOW (1968), in Technicolor and letterboxed Panavision.  Again, we are mostly on a soundstage, with Fred Astaire and Tommy Steele as leprechauns and Petula Clark at her loveliest as Astaire's daughter.  This E.Y. Harburg-Fred Saidy-Burton Lane musical has songs I cannot get out of my head weeks later, including ""Look to the Rainbow,""""That Old Devil Moon,"" ""How Are Things In Glocca Mora?"" and Steele's show-stopper:  ""If I'm Not With the Girl I Love, I'll Love the Girl I Am With.""  The movie is glorious and very underrated, from a late 1960's era of underrated movie musicals, including STAR! and HELLO, DOLLY!BELLS ARE RINGING.(1960), with Vincente Minnelli directing a delightful Betty Comden-Adolph Green screenplay, with Jule Styne music, is a great musical vehicle for wonderful Judy Holliday, re-creating a Tony winning stage role.  She is a switchboard operator named Melasande at Susanswerphone in a lower-depths part of Manhattan.  She is not supposed to get personally involved with the clients, but as ""Mom"" falls in love with songwriter Dean Martin.  She also does not know that bookie Eddie Foy, Jr. is using the answering service as a gambling front.  Terrific songs here include the legendary ""Just in Time"" and ""The Party's Over"".  DVD bonuses, in addition to remastered color and sound, include outtake musical numbers and a filmmaking documentary.  You also get to see a CinemaScope movie at its right aspect ratio.The two crown jewels of the BROADWAY TO HOLLYWOOD set are double disks of Charles Walters' EASTER PARADE (1948) and Vincente Minnelli's THE BANDWAGON (1953).  Both have magnificently remastered sound and picture to look and sound brand new. EASTER PARADE has about fifteen old and new Irving Berlin songs, performed by the incomparable Fred Astaire and Judy Garland.  Its magnificent bonuses include the finest Garland documentary, two full hours from PBS, that I have ever seen; a filmmaking documentary; and audio commentary by Astaire's daughter Ava and Garland biographer John Fricke.  This is an all-time favorite musical of mine, and I have never enjoyed it more.Last and probably best (which is saying a lot!) is THE BANDWAGON (1953), which several movie musical experts feel is the best movie musical of all time.  It is certainly one of the most sophisticated and stylish color ones, with a wonderful Oscar-nominated Comden and Green screenplay about putting on a Broadway show.  Astaire stars this time with lovely Cyd Charisse, never better than in ""Dancing in the Dark.""  Other hit songs include ""By  Myself,"" ""Shine on My Shoes."" ""Triplets,"" ""Louisiana Hayride,"" the gorgeously-designed Mickey Spillane climax, and ""That's Entertainment!""  Comden and Green have a delightful time spoofing themselves as the Nanette Fabray and Oscar Levant characters.  The biggest bonus here is audio commentary by a very happy and friendly Liza Minnelli and Michael Feinstein, along with a filmmaking documentary and an hour-long ""Men Who Made the Movies"" documentary on Vincente Minnelli.If you'd like to own this DVD boxed set, BROADWAY TO HOLLYWOOD, it retails for about $60, but sells from Amazon for about $45, less than an orchestra ticket for a  downtown San Francisco stage show.

Although I enjoyed Jennifer Connelly's sensitive performance, having now seen the original, the American version is definitely lacking the creepy, foreboding atmosphere of the Japanese version.  There are very scary moments in the film involving the mother (a great performance) daughter (an adorable, but not annoying child actress) and their ghostly encounters.  One scene of the daughter playing hide and seek at school is particularly spooky.  What I love about this movie is that it relies on atmosphere and mood to provide the scary moments and it is highly effective at providing them.  There is a huge sense of foreboding and dread throughout the film, no gore or cheap tricks, but genuine fright, the dilapidated apartment building where everything takes place is appropriately dreary and creepy.

The film is colorful, filled with wonderful Bossa Nova music, and has enough eye candy to almost make you forget the main dishes!Isabella Oliveira (Pen&eacute;lope Cruz) lives in Bahia, Brazil totally in love with Toninho Oliveira (Murilo Ben&iacute;cio) where the two have a restaurant featuring Isabella's passionate cooking  and Toninho's macho front man role.  Isabella has a problem: motion sickness - she cannot fly, ride in a car, or assume the bottom position during sex or she becomes violently ill (it seems that the sea goddess compensated her problem by making her an inimitable chef). All is well until Toninho has a brief affair that drives the crushed Isabella to move to San Francisco alone despite her love for Toninho.  There she moves in with her old friend Monica from Bahia (Harold Perrineau as a superbly enacted crossed dressed drag queen) and begins her unsuccessful search for a job.  In order to overcome her longing for Toninho and regain her culinary skills she makes a pact with the sea goddess, forsaking ever loving Toninho again. Eventually Isabella lands a TV show on Passionate Cooking when desperate producer Cliff (Mark Feuerstein) gets a whiff of her talent. She is an immediate success. Meanwhile Toninho, unable to endure life in Bahia without Isabella, flies to San Francisco and begins a series of Bossa Nova serenades to win her back.  Cliff places Toninho on Isabella's show as background music and the ratings soar.  But it is the ultimately the conflict resolution between Isabella and Toninho that brings the story to its expected end.The story may be light and the script may be pedestrian, but the direction and camera work suffuse this film with Latin American magical realism and that keeps it lighthearted and fun.  Cruz is terrific, Perrineau is the true star of the show displaying a sophisticated and sensitive acting skill that is very special, and Murilo Ben&iacute;cio is not only a hunk and eye candy but also a fine singer and a warm actor who deserves a lot of attention.

The burden of proof is on those who say it's a hoax.However we are left with the dilemna that a race of beings that are advanced enough to travel through outer space would not crash their space ships on the earth.So how can we account for this apparent discrepancy of logic ?The answer is that these creatures are evil.I read an interview given by the camera man.  He said the sheep in the area around the crash site were very agitated.  This is probably because the animals could sense the horrible occult energy.(He calls the alien creatures ""the freaks"".)Still this is a great video and very thought provoking.  Somehow fate allowed us to find out the truth about the Roswell incident.Interestingly the creatures have 6 fingers and 6 toes.  The number 6 of course has implications in the bible as being associated with evil.Who knows what the government knows or what types of technology they have.I heard a rumor recently that a plane never struck the pentagon on 9/11 but rather it was a conventional missile.Maybe they put the real plane back with the dinosaurs or something like this.A lot of people interested in the Roswell crash would probably be interested in the following book:Ufo...Contact from Planet Iargaby Stefen Denaerde, Wendelle C.

People were blacklisted and their livelihoods (and in some cases, lives) were put in danger simply because they were thought to be communists (in same cases, accurately; in many others, wrongly) and, thus, a threat to America. Hearing many of the justifications for this witch hunt in the movie (they are enemies of the state, and therefore any illegal and immoral act is justified to stop them) it was easy to think of the current campaign of hatred and fear led by people like Bill O'Falafel and Ann Coulter (who not very long ago said the US should ""send liberals to Guantanamo"").Despite its historical importance, and profound message, The Front is far from preachy and is never dull.

His sense of humor along with Rockwells makes this movie an all time classic and shows Clooneys very adapt skill at directing.",Confessions of a Dangerous Mind

337051,"It's unclear if this disc is supposed to be organised around a specific theme, the way most of the other discs in this series are.  There are three Western-themed shorts, with the other three covering a wide variety of subjects.  One wishes that Columbia would just get their act together and either start releasing these discs with shorts that all actually have something to do with the self-proclaimed theme, or start over from scratch by releasing the shorts in chronological order (and with a ""Play All"" feature; it's very annoying how you have to select the shorts one by one instead of having at least the option to play them all back-to-back).  That said, the shorts included are:'Whoops, I'm an Indian!' (1936)  This short has some funny moments, like the fishing scene, Bud Jamison's French accent, and the opening fixed gambling scene, but other than that it's one of their weaker entries from 1936.  It's solid and entertaining enough, just not anything really special or memorable.  There's also far too little slapstick or punishment, and the ending also is pretty weak and abrupt.'Healthy, Wealthy, and Dumb' (1938), the title short, is a classic.  I can't believe some people feel that the remake, 'A Missed Fortune' (1952), was actually better and funnier.  Everything flows so well, with not a wasted scene or gag, and there are too many funny and classic scenes to mention.  As a animal lover, I also loved the gold-diggers' cute little pet monkey.  The only somewhat weak spot in this short is the ending, which didn't provide any resolution to their troubles with the hotel manager.'Rockin' Thru the Rockies' (1940) is a Western-themed short, though at least it doesn't find the boys playing a bunch of dopey cowboys.  This makes it funnier and quicker-paced than most of their other Western shorts.  I did cringe a bit at how the Native Americans were portrayed, but frankly I've seen much, much worse in films of this period, so it's not like this is the most offensive and inaccurate depiction of Native Americans ever set to film.  And they're not even in that many scenes, so they're not the main focus of this short.  Maybe not one of their topmost classics, but this is a nice little gem that's one of their oft-overlooked second-tier classics.'Phony Express' (1943) is a real Western, which means it's not as funny or fast-paced as most of their other shorts.  The beginning is pretty good, but it really slows down from that point on.  In addition to the fact that I already don't like Westerns, the boys just never really seemed believable as slow-witted cowboys or in an Old West setting.  Of course they were already pretty dumb, but underneath that outward veneer of stupidity, we know that they're actually quite witty and smart.  The Old West setting also gave these shorts a much slower pace, which isn't very good for slapstick.  We also see another ending that doesn't really have the greatest resolution of the situation.  Still, at least it's one of their better Western shorts, and it is better than the dreadful remake 'Merry Mavericks' (1951).'Gents Without Cents' (1944) is a bona-fide classic, even if only for the ""Niagara Falls"" skit.  It also demonstrates how entertainers in those days really had to be able to do it all (singing, dancing, acting, the whole nine yards), particularly since many of them got started in vaudeville, as opposed to entertainers today who only can do one thing.  However, I do agree that it kind of slows down with the dancing routine the girls do at the show put on at the shipyard (although at least they cut into less time than in the similar 'Rhythm and Weep' [1946]).  Still, it's nice to get a glimpse of what their vaudeville act must have been like.'If a Body Meets a Body' (1945) is a remake of 'The Laurel and Hardy Murder Case' (1930), and officially ushers in the sick Curly era.  It's shocking to see how different he sounds and looks from how he did in the classic 'Idiots Deluxe,' the short that came out just prior to this.  Still, this is one of the few enjoyable shorts from this painful era, since here he has significantly more energy than in something like 'Three Loan Wolves' or 'A Bird in the Head.'  He also still has a lot of physical coordination and dexterity in this short.  So it's not one of those later shorts where you're really distracted by how he looks, sounds, and acts like a sick man (though there are a few eerie moments here when his cries of pain actually sound real and not just like he's acting).  Overall, a pretty good short and a nice spoof of horror movies.These shorts might not all be of the same consistently great quality, but there are enough good ones here to recommend it.","THE THREE STOOGES 3 episodes ~ Disorder in the Court 1936 Healthy, Wealthy and Dumb 1938 Pardon my Scotch 1935  VHS"

595587,"I can't get over how so many reviewers missed the mark on this erotic, honest film.  But let me go back.  I have seen some of the latest Spanish films (Sex and Lucinda is great), which are hot all right, but this one, Y Tu Mama Tarnbien finally pushes the envelope to the realm of pornography.  Sure it's artistic, so it's not pornography.  It's actors getting naked and excited, so it is pornography; well, it certainly aroused.  I heard it was a good flick, but was sure glad my kids weren't around.  Why did she do that to those young boys, daddy?Back in the Seventies, Deep Throat made porn films popular and the early porn directors actually thought they would merge their product into a respectable Hollywood studio.  That never happened.  Those who viewed the documentary Inside Deep Throat understand what I mean.  T Yu seems to bring sensuality and Hollywood entertainment full circle.  Naked bodies doing naked body stuff during a Mexican, On the Road buddy and older chick flick, well who'da thought?I think the Mexican poor are romanticized somewhat by Cuaron.  They are shown to be sweet, suffering people with the thumb of the Federales everywhere. The Spanish Chick goes country with the natives finally, but the boys are bourgeois after all, and they end up going to college taking economics, which early in the film they swore they would never do.  That's not the only thing these macho Latinos would like to forget.It's hard to get excited about Paris Hilton or the latest Brad and Angelina venture when Spanish and Mexican directors are showing you body parts and a primer on what to do with the before mentioned unmentionables.",Y Tu Mama Tambien

641354,"A good friend of mine, and a real film buff, tried to talk herself out of seeing this remarkable and courageous movie.  Don't do it!  Forget everything you've read or heard and judge it on its own merit.  Especially with Spielberg at the helm, this could easily have been ""Avenging Spitzer, Gutfreund, Berger, et al.""  Instead, Spielberg and adapters Roth and Kushner grab us by the scruff of the neck and make us appreciate the human and political cost of the kind of revenge killing that Mossad engaged in after Munich, and that Hollywood loves to peddle (see Harrison Ford in ""Firewall"" for a recent good example).My purpose in this review is not to much to evaluate the strenghts and weaknesses of the movie (of which there are both) but instead to convince you to make up your own mind, ask your own questions, and actually see the movie instead of pre-judging it.  We need to get past the manifestly silly arguments that the movie fails to take a stand, or on the other hand that it is insufficiently sympathetic to the Israelis or the Palestinians, depending on one's individual orientation.  The film very clearly takes a stand, both personal and political.  (For Tony Kushner, as we saw in ""Angels in America,"" the personal and the political are always intertwined.)  Its stand is that the translation of ideology and/or nationalism into either initiated or responsive acts of violence, always involves a disturbing and ultimately unacceptable human cost.  Wrapped up in this is a remarkable exploration of what constitutes ""home,"" politically or personally.  Notice the constant intertwining of references and images of food, companionship, sex, family, and even the amoral nightmare of a ""family"" committed to providing its dubious services to the highest bidder, completely devoid of any moral choice.  This, too, is part of the ""stand"" that ""Munich"" takes.One great virtue of the movie is that it never explicitly applies its message to today's situation, in which presmptively innocent people (based on American concepts of jurisprudence) are demoninated ""enemy combatants"" based on mere suspicion, and denied access to legal process or counsel.  Please see this month's Harper's Magazine for an excellent article on the incompatability of western concepts of morality and justice with the currently on-going institutionalization and standardization of the use of torture.I stayed away from ""Munich"" for a while because I thought it was a little much that two well-off American jews (I am half-jewish) like Spielberg and Kushner (I don't know if Roth is jewish) were wringing their hands about the cycle of violence in the Middle East.  ""Munich"" presents no answers for the current Palestinian situation, and it can well be argued that it is the place of art to raise the questions, not answer them within a convenient 2-hour format.  (If you want quick, neatly-packaged answers like ""we really can all get aong, as Stephen King argues in the current Entertainment Weekly, then ""Crash"" is for you.)  I was unprepared for the philosophical and moral complexity that ""Munich"" presents.  Considering Spielberg's penchant for easy emotional release, making this movie was not only a mature decision artistically but a tremendously courageous one as well.Before seeing this movie, think about the moving speech made by Burt Lancaster at the end of Judgment at Nuremburg:  it is when times are hardest, when the wolf is at the door, that it is most difficult for a society to cling onto its most cherished notions of fairness, decency, and integrity.  The German people, faced with crisis, allowed their government to turn to barbarism and mass slaughter.  Today, faced with a continuous and uninterrupted ""war"" on terrorism in which more and more seemingly illegal and immoral acts (wiretapping, torture, detention without trial) are tolerated, what does it mean when our country emulates Mossad after Munich, and engages in acts that are characteristic of our ""enemy"" instead of ourselves?  This is the question that ""Munich"" so powerfully and eloquently asks.",Munich
118750,"Tom Cruise and Nicloe Kidman star in Stanley Kubrick's final film about sexual desire and suspense.  Cruise plays Dr. William Harford, a successful New York doctor.  Kidman plays his wife Alice, an aspiring art dealer.  They seem to have a very good marriage, but do they?  Bill and Alice are invited to a party at one of Bill's colleague's homes.  Soon, Alice is dancing with a strange man, while Bill is with two models.  All seems well after the party until the two begin smoking marijuana, and then the accusations begin to fly.Alice admits to having secret fantasies about having sex with a man she and Bill encountered on a vacation. She also chastises Bill for not admitting to his own fantasies.  Enraged at his wife's admission, Bill becomes obsessed with having an affair of his own to even the score with Alice. Soon, he's visiting the daughter of a dead patient and a hooker (who finds out later that she's HIV positive).  However, these tend to be rather harmless encounters as nothing becomes of either of them.  But wait, Bill's quest for satisfaction is just beginning.Bill runs into Nick Nightengale (Todd Field), a former friend from med school who now plays piano in a seedy jazz bar.  Nick tells Bill about a secret sex group that he knows about from playing piano at the house where they meet.  Intrigued, Bill manages to get the secret password from Nick he needs to get intothe house.  Once inside, Bill discovers a world of sex and very strange goings-on.  Unknown to him, the people at the house were aware of his intentions to get inside.  After being ""found out"", Bill realizes that he and his family are in potentially grave danger.  Will Bill and his family be allright, or will Bill's escapade turn out to be more than he bargained for?I thought this was a very good film.  The plot is full of twists and it will keep the viewer on their toes.  Cruise and Kidman give very good performances, and their on-screen chemistry is no surprise, because the two were married in real life when this movie was made.  I've been a big Kubrick fan for a long time, and I've enjoyed other films of his, such as ""Full Metal Jacket"".  I would rate ""Eyes Wide Shut"" second only to ""Full Metal Jacket"".  This movie is loaded with action and twists, and the viewer will surely enjoy the non-stop action.  Seeing Nicole Kidman in the nude was an added bonus.I highly recommend this film. Stanley Kubrick died shortly before this movie was finished, but his fine work is evident throughout the movie.  Kubrick fans will soon discover that this movie carries on in the fine tradition of earlier Kubrick films.  Watch and see Tom Cruise and Nicloe Kidman together in a very entertaining film.",N/A
987284,"I have been a fan of Dr. Quinn Medicine Woman (DQMW) since it first aired in 1993 on CBS. I watched every single episode and now own them all on DVD.  I was so happy to see that the movies that were made after the show went off the air were released as well on DVD.  I loved Revolutions aka Dr Quinn The Movie. It has lots of Sully (Joe Lando)!! The premise of this movie is that Katie, the Sully's young daughter is kidnapped because Sully wouldn't vote a certain way for a copper mining group. With the help of Cloud Dancing, Sully and Dr. Mike find a wagon that was in an accident and fear that Katie has been killed.  Dr. Mike blames Sully for not warning them that by not voting for the copper mine he put their family, especially their daughter, in danger. They are all very sad after burying the little girl they found.  But good news comes when word that there were two girls Katie's age traveling that day and a girl who favored Katie was seen with people in Mexico.  After an autopsy performed by Dr. Quinn confirms the dead girl isn't Katie, they and their son Brian Cooper, and others from the series (town), Jake Slicker, Robert E., Horace Bing, and Cloud Dancing go to Mexico to get Katie back.  They run into difficulties together and individually, but Sully and Robert E. save the day. This movie has it's usual wonderful cinematogrophy and historic mentions like the series did. It is a good adventure movie with a little bit of romance tied in for good measure.  The Heart Within is the second movie on this DVD. It was written by the creator of the series DQMW, Beth Sullivan. In this movie, Michaela, Sully, Katie, and Brian are traveling by train to Boston for Colleen's graduation from Harvard. She lives there now with her husband, Dr. Andrew Cook. When they arrive in Boston, they are greeted by Dr. Mike's sister Rebecca who informs the group that Mrs. Quinn, their mother, is sick in the hospital. As luck would have it, Mrs. Quinn is released to go home as long as she doesn't over do it.  She has been diagnosed with a heart condition. Again, as in the series, there are subplots throughout the movie. One is some men try to bribe Sully to help them do bad stuff. Another is Brian, who wants to be a reporter, is offered a job at the Boston Globe. And another is the prejudice that Colleen faces for being a woman and receiving the highest grade on the test to become a doctor. Sadly, Mrs. Quinn dies in this movie (Beth had a history of killing characters even when the series was on.)  She leaves her money to her daughter Michaela so that she can build her dream hospital in Colorado Springs, and she leaves money to Colleen so that she and her husband can have their own medical practice in Boston. This movie wasn't as adventurous as Revolutions, but it had it's own moments when Sully let those bad business men know what he thought about their bribe and their threats! All in all, if you are a fan of this show, then you will like the movies.  Unfortunately, The Heart Within doesn't have many of the original townsfolk in it like Revolutions does, but it is still great to see the Sully family once again. I wish there were more.",N/A

966975,"""Capote"" the film is not about the life of Truman Capote, but its about a period of his life when he saw an article in the newspaper about the murders of four family members in Holcomb, Kansas, and decided to write about it.I think this film is very educational for those who don't know anything about Truman Capote or the Kansas murders in 1959, and for those interested in reading further about Capote or the Kansas case may do so.  I would also recommend watching the original ""In Cold Blood"" film with Robert Blake playing Perry Smith, rather than the latest remake.I had read for years how writing and experiencing ""In Cold Blood"" took a big toll on Capote, and this film helps bring that home.  He wanted to help Perry Smith, but his helping prolonged the appeals process and being able to finish his book.  One can begin to see and feel the mixed feelings Truman Capote has towards the killers, especially Perry Smith.  He starts out wanting to help them, but becomes frustrated when his help has kept the appeals process dragging on for years.  He wants to finish his book but cannot until the killers are executed.  And he feels guilty for wanting them dead.  He didn't want them dead, but he did.  He visits with Perry Smith's sister who tells Capote not to be fooled by Perry and his supposed sensitivity and sweetness.  She said Perry would rather kill someone than say hello.Capote tells Harper Lee (Catherine Keener) that he felt like he and Perry grew up in the same house, only that Perry got up and went out the back door, and he (Capote) got up and went out the front door.  They both had alcoholic mothers and abusive or neglectful fathers.Towards the end when Perry telegrams Capote asking for help to find a new lawyer, Capote writes back that he searched for one (he really didn't) but couldn't find one.  Capote takes to his bed and won't take phone calls when he hears the executions are finally going through - no more appeals.  He goes to Kansas and visits with the killers one last time and starts to cry when he walks in the room.  Perry asks him to be at the hanging and he agrees, even though he probably would have rather been in bed with the covers pulled over his head.The extra interviews with Philip Seymour Hoffman, Chris Cooper, Catherine Keener et al really add to the DVD.  There is also a small clip of an interview with the real Truman Capote.Recommend.",N/A

702103,"A journalist takes a bet that he can't spend an entire night in a ""haunted"" castle.  How many times have we seen this plot?  AH, but such a premise may never have been done with such style, mood, sensitivity, etc. as seen here.  Based on Edgar Allan Poe's ""Danse Macabre"", this film reeks atmosphere and spookiness in every single frame of film.  I suspected it was Italian --hard to be sure, as my old TV copy had all English-sounding names (""Anthony Dawson"", it turns out, is NOT the English actor who appeared in 1962's DR. NO).  Barbara Steele (PIT AND THE PENDULUM, the 90's remake of DARK SHADOWS), frustrated with the attitudes of Hollywood types, thumbed her nose and had more success overseas.  Some of the voices used for dubbing sounded familiar to me... I suspect the actors involved also dubbed such shows as SPEED RACER.The plot builds slowly, inexorably...  First the journalist wanders an empty house... OR IS IT?  Then he meets the beautiful and lonely Steele, and the two fall in love so quickly one wonders if there isn't something in the air.  Then a noted doctor appears and begins explaining what's REALLY going on... except, there's more to HIM than meets the eye as well.  Throughout, the lead character refuses to take anything at face value, despite the growing number of mysteries, impossibilities, and MURDERS.  Only at the very end, perhaps, does it finally sink in that-- YES-- the house IS haunted!  But too late...It wasn't until the climax that I realized just how much the entire story structure (and even the photography!) reminded me of a story I used to hate but came to appreciate as the years went by...

312430,"Talk about the ""Buck Rodgers"" toy guns and the lobster on a string, that's all well and good. Certainly, Teenagers From Outer Space is no example of cinema par excellance, the kind they make you watch in film school. The tepid acting of lead David Love, who got the gig hanky-in-pocket as it were, seals that deal. And yet, maybe this *is* film school material after all. Director/Producer/Writer Tom Graeff actually got his movie made and sold it to a major studio. And spent nary a dime of his own money doing it! The dialogue was prerecorded to cut out the cost of editing in post-production. He got the interiors of the female lead's house for just a promise to the owner that it would appear in a Hollywood film! Why this cat didn't end up working for Roger Corman is a mystery. How many film students ever make a picture, let alone manage to sell it and get it screened from coast to coast? The fact that TFOS has a cult audience nearly 50 years later is a testament to the fact that there's something more at work here than an average B-flick. Had Graeff continued to create films, he might be considered in a class with Ed Wood today. Is that something to be proud of? Just maybe.",N/A

The story is directly related to the events of the Playstation game Final Fantasy 7 but the story within this movie is hardly worth telling. The only good thing about the movie script is that it brings back all the heroes that gamers grew to love in the original game. This CGI movie is beautiful to look at but is basically hollow at its core. The action is good, but I've seen better action combat in recent anime movies like Appleseed or Steamboy. The voice acting is OK but it never seems to truely fit in with the actions, movements, or emotions of the CGI characters on screen. I guess my greatest issue with this movie is that F.F.7 for the PS1 had such an epic and sweeping storyline that Advent Children feels so small and pointless compared to the great storytelling that inspired it. The bonus materials on Disc 2 are just OK with nothing truely amazing to mention. I know that a large group of Final Fantasy fans are ready to buy this DVD by the thousands, and they should.

But we WANT him to succeed, and rejoice in his every evil.  His cruel seductions and black homicidal perfidy make him an oddly sympathetic character, and Dennis Price's performance is, well, priceless.Then you've got Alec Guinness (whose name can be anagrammatized as ""Genuine Class"") mostly underacting as a procession of stuffed-shirt (and blouse) British aristocratic boobs, all of whom are imaginatively murdered.

I'm not sure myself to be exact, but he's much older than this performance would dictate in my opinion. Now onto the DVD, and the performance itself....This is one of the best rock DVD's on the market today in my opinion. Whitesnake has never sounded this good, and as much as I loved the days of J. Sykes, there's no denying that D. Aldrich is a wizard with his axe as well. He simply smokes, and should be considered one of the best in rock....D, Coverdale, as old as he is, still has it. I don't think he ever lost it, but age always has it's limits when it comes to effecting one's abilities to perform on a live stage. Coverdale shines there like no other. I really feel that D. Coverdale has to go down as one of the all time great vocalists in rock. This performace only proves that beyond a shadow of a doubt. Very inspiring to see him still rocking this hard, for this long are...On a side note, I saw David Lee Roth live about the same year this was recorded.

Most drummers get lost in the shuffle, not with Tommy, he makes his mark, and he's heard all the time when he plays....Much like all of the great one's, he's no exception when it comes to making an impression when performing live. Another incredible musician, who still has plenty of gas left in the tank even though he's been doing it forever....I can't say enough about this DVD, it was a huge surprise, and a great purchace. It's funny because I was very uncertain of what this band would sound like some 20 years since the last time I watched them live in person. All of my expectations were easily surpassed, and very quickly too. The minute these guys hit the stage, you could just tell that they came to rock. Highly Recommended....",N/A
920563,"""It's the sense of touch. In any real city, you walk, you know? You brush past people, people bump into you. In L.A., nobody touches you. We're always behind this metal and glass. I think we miss that touch so much, that we crash into each other, just so we can feel something.""These are the first lines spoken by Police Detective, Graham Waters (Don Cheadle) in Paul Haggis' Academy Award winning film, ""Crash"". In the film we watch how in a 36 hour period (mostly in the night), Detective Waters and more than a dozen diverse characters of different race, culture and economic class cross paths and both literally and emotionally 'Crash' into each other.Director-Writer, Paul Haggis' film examines the complexity of racial relations. The emotionally moving script provides no real answers to our problems of racism. Instead it holds up a mirror and looks at the people involved. There are no 'good guys' or 'bad guys'. No, white or black hats are worn. None of these characters turn out to be as they initally seem. All of them eventually are put into emotionally dramatic situations, where either they find some good in themselves or they are forced to confront darker parts of their personalities, that they are loathed to admit exist. As Matt Dillon's openly racist LAPD cop tells his rookie partner, ""You think you know who you are? You have no ideal"". That one line pretty much sums up what ""Crash"" is about.""Crash"" won the 2006 Acadamy Award for ""Best Motion of the Year"" and for once the Academy got it right. Haggis provides amazing direction and a wonderful script featuring well rounded, interesting characters. The entire ensemble cast is brilliant. Standouts include Matt Dillon, Sandra Bullock, Don Cheadle, Terrence Howard, Thandie Newton, Ludacris, Michael Pena and Shaun Toub. I'm moved by their performances every time I see this film.Finally, I want to mention two technical aspects of the film. James Muro's beautiful cinematography, really makes the City of L.A. come alive seeming both inviting and dangerous. This is such a beautiful movie to watch. Also, I absolutely love Mark Isham's amazing musical score, which so inhances the emotional mood of the film. This is punctuated by the beautiful ending song ""In the Deep"" (written & sung by Bird York) which I absolutely love. This film has one of the best soundtracks I've heard in recent years.I would highly recommend the two DVD disc, ""Directors Cut"" of this film. This DVD set features several excellent documentaries on the making of the movie plus deleted scenes, music videos and script & story board comparisons. Best of all is the well informed commentary track from Writer/Director, Paul Haggis and Actor/Producer, Don Cheadle. They talk in detail about the making of the film and its themes and storylines.This is a wonderful film drama. I've seen it a number of times and always find myself emotionally moved by it. Isn't that what great filmmaking is all about? Fantastic movie! Highly recommended!",Crash
170994,"Al Gore is at it again with his liberal environmentalist whacko issues of the so-called global warming. We cannot say it's the truth, and it should only be based on theory. Global warming is only used by liberals as a scare tactic. Al Gore spent too much time growing up as a city slicker in Washington when his segregationalist daddy, Al Sr, was in the Senate. Gore only relies on data released by these so-called environmentalists.If you really want to know better about the environment, it is not CO2 emissions that causes global warming. While CO2 is the heaviest gas in our atmosphere, all human and animal life exhale CO2 which is a beneficial gas that vegetation thrives on such as trees and plants that take in the CO2 and convert it back to oxygen. Also, the ""warming"" we are experiencing is due to the fact that climate changes occur in cycles. There have been record highs over one hundred years ago as well as record lows in between. The last few winters we've experienced were at record lows, particularly in upstate New York where temperatures dipped down to a fridgid -35F. Now what does that explain? In any part of the world climate does not remain stable where one would experience the same temperatures over and over again at a certain time of year since there are changes occurring all the time, it alternates.Volcanic eruptions would be a very big problem since a single volcano can release nearly ten times more toxic gases than all manmade emissions throughout the world combined. Third world nations account for environmental problems where there are virtually no strict codes on hazardous waste disposal. Hence, disease is rampant in these nations that have very few or no sanitation facilities by dumping solid waste directly into drinking water or into the ocean where deep water coral reefs thrive. Yes, there are deep water reefs in many parts of the world that encapsulate CO2 and other gases. Pollutants dumped into the sea are killing these reefs, thus releasing these gases into the atmosphere.True environmentalists are usually those employed by the logging industry that have done intense studies, maintaining nurseries, and replacing each hewned tree with two to four saplings. Younger trees, particularly saplings, thrive better on CO2 and have the tendency to release more oxygen than older specimens.We can only say that Al Gore has a lot of learning to do. He's just jumping to conclusions and listening to whatever data is available to him. This film would only be based on his opinions and not on fact.",N/A
