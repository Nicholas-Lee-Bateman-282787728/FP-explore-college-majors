320439,"A few years ago I completely binged on all things Charlie Chaplin.  I literally watched about twenty of his films in a week and I remember quite distinctly the night I watched &#8216;The Great Dictator&#8217; because it was the night that my wife went into labor and so it ended my marathon of Chaplin films.  I had other things to occupy my time for a while.  I remember this film for many other reasons as well, obviously, but that is the first thing I think about when people mention this movie.Chaplin&#8217;s first real talkie, &#8216;The Great Dictator&#8217; is an astute and powerful political satire wrapped up in Chaplin&#8217;s iconic comedic style.  It is also one of the best films of the 40&#8217;s.  Taking on the reprehensible Hitler, Chaplin paves the way for greats like Alec Guinness and Peter Sellers by taking on two distinct characters with their own identities and their own storylines.  Playing both an innocent Jewish barber and the sadistic dictator he is mistaken for, Chaplin&#8217;s remarkable look at the political state of the times is as poignant today as it was then.Littered with wonderful performances from Chaplin as well as Jack Oakie and Paulette Goddard, which help anchor the film and layer it with emotion as well as comedic perfection, &#8216;The Great Dictator&#8217; is a great film that will leave the audience wanting more.",N/A
1684951,"My daughter and I saw this movie in IMAX.  Everything you've heard is true - like James Cameron said, it's the greatest space movie ever made (as far as realism). No monsters or energy weapons, no evil interstellar empires, no spacecraft making roaring noises as they fly by, or maneuvering like dogfighting F16's - just a really bad day for current-tech astronauts. When Sandra Bullock uses a cordless driver to loosen bolts while spacewalking, what we hear is what she would hear in her spacesuit ; the muffled whine of the motor and muffled thumps of engaging the bolt heads, all conducted through her arm and suit. And a lot of breathing. When pieces of space debris impact the Shuttle and the ISS, there is no noise, but the story urgency is maintained by the radio chatter, the musical score and the spectacular and detailed explosions of pieces and assemblies flying and tumbling in all directions, in straight lines. All this set against a cloud-covered Earth. When I could spare a second from the action, I remember noticing both Italy and the Sinai Peninsula. I'm sure others saw more.George Clooney plays the experienced spaceman, who is a master of keeping the work schedule moving with a light and friendly mood, mostly through non-stop stories from his colorful life. One minute they're eye-rolling groaners, the next they're a welcome, calm and distracting anchor for sanity in the void. Sandra Bullock is the rookie astronaut with a medical degree who is nevertheless being put to work checking out Hubble's circuit boards. She's competent and capable, but it takes all she's got to work on the Hubble while perched at the end of the Canadarm.Sandra and George are the only on-camera actors in this 1 1/2hr movie. Ed Harris plays the voice of the CAPCOM in Houston.. (If anything ever happens to Tom Hanks, I think Ed Harris would have to take up a lot of the slack).The space debris becomes a problem when the Russians fire a missile to destroy one of their own satellites (""Probably a spy sat"", says George). The destruction becomes a cascading domino effect that quickly engulfs dozens of other satellites, and the whole mess turns into a cloud of hypervelocity space junk orbiting at the same height as the Shuttle repair mission on the Hubble. This debris cloud takes a couple minutes to whiz by, or impact on something, and then you have 90 minutes before it orbits the Earth and catches up with you again. Nice !The movie gives you a real sense of what's waiting just beyond NASA's experience, research, protocols and contingency plans. When one area of tech causes problems for another area (human-caused space debris becoming a deadly threat to humans in orbit) we're back to gut-level reactions, self-control and creative improvisation, particularly since we lose Ed Harris's, and therefore Ground Control's, presence early in the catastrophe.As a scifi freak, I noticed some fishy things about this otherwise very physics-realistic movie, such as how the Hubble, the ISS and the Chinese space station all seemed to be in the same neighborhood, flying in a loose formation up there. Not so. In reality the orbits are at different heights, therefore traveling at different speeds, and also at different inclinations relative to each other. The overall sequence of events in the movie is  impossible, as far as movement between assets by free-floating astronauts.You can't be replacing batteries in the Hubble, and an hour later cruise over to the ISS with nothing but a spacesuit jet-pack.  Also, a couple little things, like Sandra Bullock's space helmet floating around in the cabin of a Soyuz that is currently decelerating, rather than jammed against the dashboard. For it to float, both it and the Soyuz have to be flying at the same speed.I also have to believe that seeing this movie in 3D is the way to go. Several scenes made you feel like you're crawling on the outside of the ISS right with the astronauts.There's the rounded hump of a cylindrical section, covered with sun shield material, between you and them; you're waiting your turn to go in the airlock, and all you hear is voices and breathing on the radio, while huge chunks of debris fly by, momentarily blocking the sun and making you wince and blink. And when Sandra goes tumbling out of control, far away from anyone or anything else, for a moment you feel what it would be like to be that helpless, with a dwindling oxygen supply, only static on the radio, and with Earth and Heaven chasing each other in a circle across your field of vision.But I am just another person willing to suspend disbelief for the sake of the experience, and this movie gets so much right, or at least what looks right (I haven't made it up to Low Earth Orbit, myself, yet) that I still came out of it having learned something. Just like being in any other wilderness, drifting free in Earth orbit can either be stunningly beautiful or a black terror. It's up to you to make that choice.",N/A

1686016,I just finished watching this movie and am extremely disappointed.  It definitely was NOT an Oscar nominee movie in my opinion.  I think casting was a huge disaster.  Sandra Bullock was fantastic.  George Clooney was a joke in this movie.  Definitely not his type of flick.  The movie was interesting but choppy in places.  I think if more thought and expertise was put into the the whole project they could have had a great movie.  The end... absolutely horrible.  I just sat there saying to myself... that's it?  That's how it ends??  The hype about this movie made me think it was going to be something really special.  NO way.  Definitely not a movie I would recommend unless someone has it already and you want to borrow it just to watch it but not worth spending the money to purchase it.

1686868,"There are few directors that I have an undying respect for that have let me down as consistently and for as long as Martin Scorsese has. For the first decade or so of his career, he's made some of the best films EVER MADE (TAXI DRIVER, RAGING BULL, THE LAST TEMPTATION OF CHRIST, GOODFELLAS, MEAN STREETS, AFTER HOURS) and for the last twenty-three years, I don't believe the man has made a truly great film (THE DEPARTED was decent for what it was, but hardly Best Picture material). But suddenly, THE WOLF OF WALL STREET came around, and I felt like the past 23 years of his films, ranging from respectfully decent to tragically god-awful, had been just a bad dream, and with his three-hour character study of a young man coming from nothing with just an insatiable hunger to consume more in just a few years than a thousand people could consume in their collective lifetimes, Scorsese becomes an alchemist, transforming the most deporable human behavior into film gold.The film follows a few years in the life of real-life figure Jordan Belfort (DiCaprio), as he seeks his fortunes on Wall Street. He gets life advice in the form of an immoral senior trader at the first company he works for (gloriously personified by Matthew McConaghey) as he extolls the ""virtues"" of theft, greed, drugs and masturbation. He then starts his first big day on Wall Street on October 19th, 1987, aka Black Monday, where the stock market took its biggest fall since the 1929 crash. Out of work, he goes to work at a semi-legal brokerage house working out of a strip-mall that sells ""penny stocks"", which are stocks for extremely small companies with little to no net worth. He uses his slick salesmanship and gets a ridiculous 50% commission for everything he sells, which is something unheard of at the major firms. Then, he attracts those same people as well as the cousin-marrying schlub Donny (a glorious Jonah Hill), to join him in his own firm he calls Stratton-Oakmont (to give it that old money WASP-y flavor). His main salespeople are all weed dealers, because they know how to push their product. Stratton grows at a geometric rate as it continues selling the penny stocks and parlaying those sales into the established stocks, and suddenly, in his mid-twenties, he's making millions of dollars. He's also engorging himself on hookers, cocaine and his personal favorite drug, quaaludes like they're all going out of style. Despite being married, he attracts what he believes is the perfect woman for him, a former Miss Long Island, the beautiful Naomi (newcomer Margot Robbie), and soon leaves his wife for her. He buys mansions, huge yachts, expensive sportscars and even a helicopter. He even has an enforcer of sorts in his father Max (a BRILLIANT Rob Reiner), who tries to lead him on a smarter path, but Jordan believes himself invincible, even when he is confronted by FBI Agent Patrick Denham (Kyle Chandler) who has pretty much everything he needs to arrest Jordan for all of the many illegal things he's doing on a daily basis. Alas, the mighty must fall at some point, and a downward spiral of events threatens everything Jordan has built his life upon.This could have easily been a cautionary tale ala Oliver Stone's WALL STREET, which has a more cathartic ending, but that tale has already been told. Instead, Scorsese dares you to find these utterly disgusting and amoral characters sympathetic at points, and dares you even further to actually root for them. This seems to be the thesis of this film, and if Leonardo DiCaprio hadn't crafted the best performance of his career in this film, it would have been all for naught. As Belfort, DiCaprio is utterly magnetic and daringly seductive. He's not an evil man, nor are the people that surround him; he comes off as more of a charming rogue bucking the system rather than a Gordon Gekko-type whose every move drips with malevolence. This is not to say that Jordan is a good guy; he's a horrible human being, but the film allows you as the audience to make your judgments about him and his acolytes. While the film could be conceived as a drama, it lacks the necessary aforementioned catharsis to allow it to drift too far into drama and plays more as not only a vicious satire of the lifestyles of the money-obsessed 80's and early 90's, but also as high comedy. If you're not laughing a lot at the debauchery on display within the opening minutes of the film, THE WOLF OF WALL STREET is decidedly not a film for you. Much has also been made of the film's record-breaking use of the F-word in its many iterations (noun, verb, adjective, adverb, etc.), and again, if you find that word offensive, even when not used in astounding excess, this is not a film for your tastes.Much credit is to be given to screenwriter Terence Winter, who has also written several episodes of THE SOPRANOS and BOARDWALK EMPIRE, who gives each character, no matter how small, a very specific voice. And the myriad of performers who make small but important contributions such as Joanna Lumley, Jon Favreau, Jon Bernthal and a brilliant Jean Dujardin really round out the cast. Hill continues his upswing into more significant films (as long as I can forget about THIS IS THE END), and continues to prove that he's more than just a one-trick pony.Let us not forget Scorsese, who not only directs the film with verve, excitement, energy and precision, but lets most of his thematic necessities go for this film, which is unlike anything he's ever done. There's no examples of the Madonna/Whore complex; there's no heavy Catholic symbolism; I don't even think there's a Rolling Stones song in the soundtrack. And the three-hour run time of the film breezes by.THE WOLF OF WALL STREET is a startling revelation of a film from a director who I had believed had his best days behind him, but if nothing else, it proves that an old dog can learn new tricks, even if those tricks include an EPIC quaalude crawl.",N/A

That you can't trust anyone that hands you something for free and that ""believers"" of any kind will go to any length to prove their ego right, even if it means lying to themselves and everyone else.This film is more of an interesting case study in human psychology than it is aliens. I heard ""In every lie there's a grain of truth"" over and over. That to me is so amazingly funny, it boarders on sad. In every lie there's nothing but lies. There's no rule that says you have to tell some of the truth if you lie. It doesn't make the lie more believable at all. People who think there's some form of truth in every lie are trying hard to keep their egos from being bruised. They're basically saying, ""Yes, I know I'm being fooled and being made to look stupid, but I'm sure that part of this is true because I have to believe it is.""  Seriously, if people believe the government in the 1940's allowed humans to go to an alien planet with a mess of aliens and come back with samples, you deserve to look stupid. What's more believable? That an alien race, billions of light years away came to this backwater, no where blue rock, interacted with a comparatively mentally retarded species and then take the time to help cover it all up.. for no reason at all. Or that some bored guy who can't let go of his job lying to people and making them look stupid copied the plot from a movie and sent it to ""believers?"" What magical spell would Spielberg hold that would allow him to have such amazing information to make a movie about? Ohhh, that's right, it was the government telling a lie that had ""truth"" in it.Human beings are so egotistical that they will believe anything to seem special. It's shockingly amazing. I'd laugh if it weren't so darn pathetic. That wormy guy is a government trained master troll. Lol",Mirage Men

1680513,"Directed by Stephen Frears (The Queen, Liam, High Fidelity, Dirty Pretty Things, My Beautiful Launderette, The Grifters, etc), with a screenplay by Steve Coogan and Jeff Pope based on the book The Lost Child of Philomena Lee by Martin Sixsmith and with a cast that features Judi Dench and Steve Coogan, this film was destined to be a success. If at times the story becomes a bit `Hallmarky' that flaw is quickly diminished because of the power of the story and the manner in which it was made.Former BBC journalist Martin Sixsmith (Steve Coogan) is dismissed from the Labour Party in disgrace and is at a loss as to what do. His loathing for `human interest stories' is legendary, but that changes when a young Irish woman approaches him about a story of her mother, Philomena (Judi Dench), who when she fell pregnant as a teenager in Ireland in 1952, was sent to the convent to be looked after as a fallen woman. She cared for her baby for three years until the Church took him from her and sold him, like countless others, to America for adoption. Coerced into signing a document promising never to attempt to see her child again, she nonetheless spent the next fifty years secretly searching for him, unaware that he was searching for her from across the Atlantic. Suddenly struck by the strength of the story Martin arranges a magazine assignment about her search for Anthony that eventually leads to America. Along the way, Martin and Philomena discover as much about each other as about her son's fate. Furthermore, both find their basic beliefs challenged.There are many fascinating aspects to the story and the manner in which it ends but to share those would destroy the film for other viewers. Love conquers all and there is something in the genes that never lets go. Dench, Coogan, and Cathy Belton deserve special kudos but he cast that includes such non-verbal roles as Sean Mahon, and the bit parts by Peter Hermann, Mare Winningham, Sophie Kennedy Clarke, and Barbara Jefford add immensely to this sensitive film.

1683016,"I love Arnold and Sly and the more they spew their silly one liners the better. That being said, while they do a fair amount of fighting, nothing like we are used to, the blow ups are a minimum since this is more technical. He is a security expert that gets himself thrown in the most notorious and unbreakable prisons and finds a way out. He is a thinker, he observes and does more than report. He exposes the weakness in the system and he gets paid very well for it. When he is approached to try his Houdini act on the worlds more impenetrable prison he takes the job knowing his friends are always there in case something goes wrong. Soon he finds his identity erased and all trails leading to him are gone. Getting out now is paramount and a matter of life and death, literally. Arnold already an inmate decides to befriend him. Together they attempt the impossible. It does get tense and there are prison fights, no surprise there, but once he figures a way out, he discovers just how hopeless the situation he is in. The last 45 minutes or so are a fight to get away and somehow get help before they discover who Arnold really is and why it is so important to keep Sly in. Things explode in the end and Arnold gets his signature big gun so all things are not lost. This is a different role for both actors and one I found I actually liked. but it could have used a few more booms just because it's Sly and Arnold. Good popcorn movie",N/A

1486945,"Quentin Tarantino&#8217;s latest is another genre mash up, this time blending the over-the-top action of the spaghetti western with the gritty modern revenge fantasy of the blaxploitation flicks of the &#8216;70s. The result is a gory and wildly entertaining action movie with standout performances from the entire cast.The film opens with the iconic Luis Bacalov theme from Django, the ultraviolent Sergio Corbucci western from which this movie attributes its title, and we meet our hero. Django (Jaime Foxx) is a slave being dragged through the south after having been sold away from his wife, Broomhilda (Kerry Washington). He&#8217;s soon purchased and rescued by the charming German bounty hunter named Dr. King Schultz (Christoph Waltz), who rides around in a dentistry wagon. Schultz needs Django to identify three criminals so that he may kill them and claim the reward. Django turns out to be a natural gunfighter, and the two of them become fast friends. Their friendship leads them to attempt a dangerous rescue of Django&#8217;s wife, in a parable of the German fantasy &#8220;The Twilight of the Gods&#8221;, who has been sold to a particularly villainous slave owner named Monsieur Calvin Candie, owner of the notorious Candyland plantation. His pleasure involves forcing slaves to fight in gladiator style bare-knuckle wrestling matches.There&#8217;s a lot to like about this movie, and the first place to begin is with the acting. Every actor gives a great performance. Jaime Foxx goes through a subtle and yet very noticeable evolution from slave to badass bounty hunter. He&#8217;s sympathetic when he needs to be, and extremely dangerous when he has to be. There are several sides to the character that make him a believable an endearing protagonist for this style of movie, and you&#8217;ll find you&#8217;re on his side when he punishes the wicked. Christoph Waltz turns in yet another flawless performance, making his Dr. Schultz an extremely likeable killer. His every action and expression comes across so nuanced and genuine.The more surprising performances come from the villains. For the first time I think in any movie, Leonardo DiCaprio appears to be having fun with his character. He plays Monsieur Candie with such an obvious relish it&#8217;s difficult not to find him enticing. His despicable and grinning slave owner is nearly overshadowed by the almost unrecognizable Samuel L. Jackson, who plays his loyal family house slave, Stephen. It&#8217;s Stephen who&#8217;s shown to be the worst of the worst, which in this movie says a lot, and Jackson nails every line. In public he plays an Uncle Tom style slave for his master, but behind the scenes he&#8217;s wickedly sharp and even appears to be pulling the strings. All of these characters are aided by a terrific script, and I think that Tarantino's dialogue is benefited by the period setting, as it keeps his writing and characters focused on the story at hand.The influences of the spaghetti westerns are obvious, with the frequent quick zooms, sweeping wide shots, and beautiful cinematography. The movie looks gorgeous, showcasing vast snowcapped mountain ranges in one scene and the desolate heat of the southern plantation in the next. As to be expected in a Tarantino movie, let alone a western, there&#8217;s a ton of glorified violence in this. It's the kind of ridiculous, borderline cartoonish violence that can only suit the sensationalist take on the western genre. While the action scenes and bloody set pieces are well crafted and entertainingly shot, what&#8217;s really nice to see is the use of blood packs. It might seem a minor detail, but in far too many action movies (especially in the past decade) there has been an abundance of CG blood spray. It&#8217;s welcoming to see the old Robocop style gratuitous blood geysers that can only come from practical effects.The violence is well over-the-top, but this plays into the blaxploitation aspect of the film along with the often contemporary selection of songs for the soundtrack, which reinforces the crazed and ridiculous take on the setting. All of the villains, who in this case are white slave owners, are depicted as disgusting, inhuman, sadistic degenerates who deserve everything that&#8217;s coming to them by the inevitably gory end. It&#8217;s actually a little refreshing to see the American slaver owner dehumanized in such a way, and it more than suits the tone of the film.Django Unchained is hardly a movie that stresses some kind of deeper meaning or offers analysis on slavery and the morals behind it. It paints a very stark black and white picture for the sake of pure entertainment value. This is a movie meant to thrill and excite you, making every shot in every scene interesting and captivating without drawing too much attention to itself. It&#8217;s the best kind of tribute to both of the genres there can be, and it could comfortably fit into a collection of either. It&#8217;s pure bloody fun at its finest.",Django Unchained
1691604,"&#8220;Vampire Academy&#8221; is based on Richelle Mead&#8217;s bestselling series. The film relates the legend of Rose Hathaway (Zoey Deutch) and Lissa Dragomir (Lucy Fry), two 17-year-old girls who attend St. Vladamirs Academy, a hidden boarding school for Moroi (mortal, peaceful vampires) and Dhampirs (half-vampire/half-human guardians). Rose, a rebellious guardian-in-training, and her best friend, Lissa, a royal vampire princess, escape from the school but are captured and returned to the very place where they believe their lives may be in jeopardy.Thrust back into the perils of Moroi society and high school, Lissa struggles to reclaim her status while Rose trains with her mentor and love interest, Dimitri (Danila Kozlovsky), to guarantee her place as Lissa&#8217;s guardian. Rose will go to any extreme to protect Lissa from those within the Academy walls who intend to exploit her and from the Strigoi (immortal, evil vampires) who hunt her kind from outside its sanctuary.This is another picture based on young adult fiction that combines teenage angst, romance, and supernatural creatures. Since the &#8220;Twilight&#8221; series hit screens, the vampire of legend has been reduced from evil, nocturnal predator to pale-faced fashion-model types. &#8220;Vampire Academy&#8221; unimaginatively continues with that portrayal. The acting is mediocre at best and the entire film exudes a profound sense of deja vu.Special features on the Blu-ray release include alternate opening, deleted scenes, and a conversation with author Richelle Mead.",N/A

I love Operation Overdrive, RPM and SPD because those seasons are my favorites. Here are the seasons.Season 13: Power Rangers SPD. One of my favorite seasons. It is about cops turned to Power Rangers fighting criminal aliens and traveling in space. Earth is now inhabited peacefully with aliens and humans. An alien commander of a police organization recruits 5 humans to be Power Rangers to stop crime and an old enemy.Season 14: Power Rangers Mystic Force. This season is nice, but not one of my favorites. It is about 5 teens become wizard like Power Rangers fighting evil forces. Imagine Harry Potter wearing spandex, his wand become a sword like wand or a cell phone, fighting an evil knight and monsters.Season 15: Power Rangers Operation Overdrive. One of my favorites. I found out that this season is not well liked, but oh well, I do not care. This season is about brother rivals and treasure hunting. A rich man recruits 5 teens to be Power Rangers to find a powerful crown and its jewels before they fall to the wrong hands or Earth will be doomed.Season 16: Power Rangers Jungle Fury. In this season, an powerful enemy escapes from his prison and posses a human. 3 students from a secret dojo organization were chosen to stop him. This season is almost similar to Wild Force because they had animal spirits.Season 17: Power Rangers RPM. The last season released from Disney era. One of my favorites. This season is one of the darkest season in Power Rangers history. This season is almost similar to the Terminator. Earth is ruined and humans are almost extinct thanks to a powerful computer virus and its machine army. 5 humans were chosen to protect the last of the humans and a small city dome from an Skynet like organization.As a loyal fan of Power Rangers for over 20 years, I gave this season box set 5 stars.",Power Rangers: Seasons 13 -17

First, the picture is terribly grainy, with white threads and dots from the film.  In this day of digital restoration, it is a shame to sell a piece without cleaning it up a little.  The sound and music is equally full of hiss and pop, which greatly reduced how much I enjoyed the show.I was also disappointed that the cover art is touched up and painted, but the film is black and white only.

Intimidated by experienced guys she decides to lose her virginity with another virgin and after running into Takashi at a bookstore she is sure she has found the man for the job.

While I know men and women that have slept with numerous partners I have never met anyone that had intended or wanted to do so which is why I found the premise a little unbelievable, but after watching a few episodes my opinion changed. The show doesn't focus of Yamada sleeping around with numerous guys instead it focuses on her naivete, insecurities and attempts to lose her virginity.The animation is top notch, the characters are entertaining, the story is absolutely hilarious and the English dub is excellent! If you dislike crass or crude humor this show is probably not for you, but if you enjoy sex comedies you will most likely love it. This is not to say the show is explicit just the opposite it's the cleanest sex comedy I've ever seen I'm just saying it may not be for everyone!Be warned this anime contains very suggestive themes and a small amount of fan service so it is not suitable for children!

That said, I found it ironic that a large percentage of the staff who were treating the anorexic/bulimic patients at Renfrew were themselves obese. This struck me as bizarre, but it was never addressed, or even acknowledged. The message, which came through loud and clear, is that at Renfrew it's acceptable to be overweight and unhealthy, but not acceptable to be underweight and unhealthy. A lot of the staff seemed nearly as messed up psychologically as the patients, and some of them were creepily reminiscent of Nurse Ratched, especially in the awful group session/meeting in which one of the more cruel staff members succeeds in getting one patient (Shelly, a psychiatric nurse????) to rat out another (Polly), with the result that Polly is labeled a troublemaker and evicted from Renfrew.

749389,"NYPD Blue is as realistic  to what it is like to be a policeman as it gets on TV. This show doesn't have the hip music playing while some runway model turned actress collects evident samples at a crime scene or performs an autopsy. It doesn't romanticize the brutality of crime it displays it and the impact it has on the lives of victims. It does inject some humor as in real life detectives need humor to assist them in getting through some days. This show is well written and extremely well acted.  Even bit parts are given to very talented actors and actresses. You will see a lot of familiar faces in some very small parts. For a dose of mystery, suspense and good acting rent or buy this series.",NYPD Blue - Season 2

1696390,"I truly enjoyed this film, both in the theater and now at home.  The acting is first rate.  The plot is a combination of fairy tale fantasy together with allusions to real history, with a bitter sweet recognition of the transformation of culture from something stilted but refined to something more coarse and cheap.Based loosely on the memoirs of Stephan Zweig and also calling to mind the memoir-like essays of Peter Drucker, both of whom reminisce about Europe in the first half of the 20th century as it passed through two great wars, this film has significant subtext to go with its whimsy.There is exquisite tension between those with dignity, loyalty and integrity and those without it.  Many of those who have the greatest integrity perish on its account.  Some with individual minor flaws still turn out to be the most heroic and upright.  The film also subtly demonstrates the advantages of taking people one at a time, as individuals, while also leaving room for group solidarity.I cannot think of how to illustrate these themes without risking spoilers, so I will just stop with the recommendation that you buy or rent this film and see it for yourself.",N/A

822464,"How many times have news headlines featured sex scandals involving high level politicians? Exactly. Too many to count. That makes THE POLITICIAN&#8217;S WIFE timely, important and relevant.While not entirely successful due to an at times obvious anti-Conservative bias, this superb production takes a familiar scenario and turns it on its ear. By focusing on the wronged wife&#8217;s perspective, writer Paula Milne injects new life into what could have been a heavy-handed tirade against the abuses of power.Walking a fine line between condemning blatant hypocrisy and asserting the producers&#8217; apparent political views, THE POLITICIAN&#8217;S WIFE works best when it takes you inside the mind and swirling emotions of Juliet Stevenson&#8217;s Flora. Her emotional breakdown is both heart-breaking and fascinating and her subsequent course of action (read Revenge) is alternately satisfying, disastrous and unexpectedly life-changing. Flora&#8217;s thoroughly rotten adulterer husband is made palatable simply by being played by Trevor Eve, a likeable actor who is unafraid to take tremendous risks with this role. One wonders how often he was recognized in public after the initial broadcast and told off, in no uncertain terms, by some formerly adoring fan (it happens).Probably the most remarkable aspect of THE POLITICIAN&#8217;S WIFE is how it analyzes the whole concept of Betrayal. There are other themes as well, including hypocrisy, honour, morality, etc. But the anatomy of betrayal has rarely been better portrayed. Eve&#8217;s Duncan is a man so wholly convinced of his own destiny that his sense of entitlement is astounding. He relies so completely on his wife (she even cuts his toenails for him when he&#8217;s in the bath) and yet his reprehensible act of betrayal is somehow justified in his own mind.The series then asks the question &#8220;when is revenge justified?&#8221; And at what cost? The transformative power of betrayal is examined with a surgeon&#8217;s precision, using a literary scalpel to peel away the layers of humanity that are sacrificed when individuals become desensitized to commitment, loyalty and dedication, (whether to another individual or to a cause, i.e. &#8220;the Party&#8221;).The outcome of THE POLITICIAN&#8217;S WIFE may shock as well as (or instead of) satisfy. Along the way there is a positively brilliant cliffhanger at the end of episode two which illustrates why Duncan is such a successful politician. You won&#8217;t see it coming. Nor are you likely to guess the conclusion to this superior drama.As mentioned, the only reservation this reviewer has is the implication that hypocrisy and corruption are limited to the political party representing conservative values. There exists in the arts world a proclivity for liberalism that is often very much at odds with &#8220;traditional values&#8217;. When this spills over into obvious bias it contradicts the supposed fair way of thinking many artists proclaim. Were this aspect trimmed from THE POLITICIAN&#8217;S WIFE the film would be in a much better place to express moral outrage. Hypocrisy and betrayal are unfortunate traits of human nature, encouraged by power and privilege. They are not specific to any political idealogy or professed moral world view. The news headlines are proof of that.",N/A

She is not a main character whatsoever or even important. They are very awkward scenes and I couldn't even make sense of them. But that pretty much sums up the whole movie.The main reason I rented this though, wasn't mainly for Sobieski but for Anthony Roth Costanzo's role, who is now a distinguished and famous counter tenor. And one of my most favorite opera singers. I loved his role as Francis (which he won an award for) in &#34;A Soldier's Daughter Never Cries&#34; (also with Leelee Sobieski.) So I wanted to see him in this movie, &#34;Lying,&#34; as well. After watching this very very boring movie for some time anxiously waiting for him, I suddenly heard him singing out of nowhere at a random part. He sounded to be coming from outside the house, and with Sevingy's character not letting them go outside, all 4 girls end up running around the house trying to find out him and where this voice is coming from. Sometimes it sounds like he is in the house, in different places. So the whole scene just shows them frantically running around, while Sevingy's character ends up just standing at the fireplace with her glass of wine just watching and laughing at them. After a whole 5 minutes of this, she finally tells them that &#34;he's in the fireplace&#34; and they rush to see. He sings one last time. And that was that. He is never seen or heard again. His voice was beautiful and it was a fun scene at first but then it just became quite spooky and weird like he was a ghost. When asked if she knew who or what it was, she tells the girls &#34;no.&#34; Of course, she has a lot of secrets. They have a hard time believing this at first, but they all finally relax. One of the girls decides he should have a name, and picked out &#34;Timothy.&#34; So that's the story of the character &#34;Timothy.&#34; I was prepared that he just only might be a &#34;voice&#34; in the movie, and that if he was, that it would still be worth paying the money to see this. Was it? Ummmm......Other than that, it is just a really weird movie with actors who don't know what to do most of the time and so much randomness that doesn't make much sense. I don't know why this &#34;M&#34; decided to make this movie, and in only 15 days with NO actual script. Perhaps it was an experiment? Well, epic fail. Congratulations. I don't understand at all how or why this movie is still around but not a great one such as &#34;A Soldier's Daughter Never Cries.&#34; I had to buy it on ebay.",N/A

512660,"I'm rather a latecomer to this movie, as I don't seek out Jean Rollin movies (based on what little I have seen), but as this is supposed to be something of a classic of it's type, I gave it a go  - but it is certainly not converting me into a fan.The slim story sees a dead girl named Catherine unexpectedly revived in her coffin when disturbed by grave robbers. She quickly attacks one of them, and then seemingly in a daze, makes her way rather unsteadily back to an empty castle which is her former home. Her newly living status comes to the attention of her former best friend Helene, who seems to think the best course of action is to keep Catherine hidden in the empty mansion, rather than seek help - even despite the realisation that her friend craves the taste of fresh blood!I was really expecting something more stylish from this movie due to it's reputation, but I have to say I think it's really poorly made. Jean Rollin was no genius, if movies like this are the evidence. Several shots are out of focus, the acting is poor, the dialogue stilted and the gore effects are downright terrible. You can clearly see the tubes that squirt blood from a throat in one shot, and the bag that Catherine is squeezing in her hand to squirt gore from a stomach wound in another. All Rollin seems to be interested in is keeping his actresses nude, for as often and as long as possible. The two leads are both very attractive, and the ornate mansion is very picturesque, but that doesn't mean that Jean Rollin is using any talent to show that off. Anyone who is not part of the main cast is so obviously an amateur, and the direction of scenes involving extras is terrible - they continually stare directly at the camera, in almost evert shot. I guess the lighting is pretty enough in daytime scenes, but at night, everything is floodlit by flat, harsh industrial lighting. And the castle's underground vaults seem to have enough light to grow tomatoes in!I also read that the portrayal of the relationship between the two women is strong enough to carry the film, but again, I don't think this is true either. As Catherine becomes more and more aware of what she is, things get more interesting, and there are moments that hint at some depth, but these are few. In conclusion, I am amazed that people rate this movie so highly. I think it is average at best. It has a lot of nudity, which seems to please a lot of viewers, but having acting and special effects that are as downright poor is they are here, strips this effort of any redeeming value.Just to bang the last coffin nail in, I like the fact that the latest Redemption Bluray and DVD release has a shot of the film's climax on it's front cover that blatantly gives away the ending.

1306348,"I've seen this movie at least a dozen times since my sister recommended it. It's one of those movies that one enjoys over and over again. Why? Here's my list of reasons why:1. The actors Tom Cruise and Cameron Diaz. Both are immensely likeable whether or not you approve of their lives outside the movie house. However, I surmise, right or wrong, that they did not particularly like each other as themselves. If I'm right, that means their acting is quite convincing because they do have chemistry in this film.2. The plot is absolutely ludicrous, but that is part of the charm of the movie. It is violent but not violent. So many bullets fly around Tom's character, yet he is not hit until the end (not giving anything away).3. The title is a play on words. The knight hides the battery (see the movie to understand the inference). The day that may or may not come.4. Very few curse words fly; in fact, each time I hear one I am reminded of how few there are.5. The comedy is delightful. I love every line each character has. My favorites: &#34;With me. Without me.&#34; &#34;Someday means never. It never comes.&#34; &#34;This is Someday, Roy.&#34; Oh, yes, the words about undressing her. Ha ha.

1613837,"When this highly rated miniseries first aired on the History Channel in spring 2013, I was unimpressed. I caught a few minutes of the first episode, watched at least one of the Jesus episodes, and concluded that it was mostly flash over substance. But after finally buying the DVD set in March 2014, and watching it all the way through, I'm surprised to say that it's actually quite an impressive series despite its flaws. As a scripture teacher at a Catholic high school, I can now say I highly recommend it as a good visual sampling of the sacred text.The best thing about this series is that it depicts the entire Bible, in 10 episodes, as one overarching theme of God's love for humanity. There is a continuity of style and theme in the filmmaking that is breathtaking to witness on film, as the video flies through the Hebrew Torah and New Testament with startling narrative drive. Rather than having to rent multiple videos with different actors and technical crews to follow the Bible on film, we've got it all -- well, the greatest hits -- here in one miniseries.The Old Testament episodes wisely depict God's relationship with humanity through God's five covenants with Adam, Noah, Abraham, Moses, and David. Some of these episodes are quite good, particularly the deeply moving episode concerning Abraham, which captures his story -- a highlight is the climactic near-sacrifice of his son Isaac -- with poignancy and clarity. Each episode is organized by a theme that holds together disparate Biblical sources remarkably well. The Moses episode is excellent despite ending too abruptly as he returns from Sinai with the commandments, depriving us of the Golden Calf and many other memorable moments. The episodes on Joshua, Samson, King Saul, and King David do a fine job in depicting the rise of Israel's kingdom. But the episode featuring Israel's subjugation under Babylon and Persia carries perhaps the greatest power outside of the Abraham material, giving us iconic renditions of the fiery furnace and Lion's Den captivity stories from the Book of Daniel, with heartfelt performances by the actors playing Daniel and others.The New Testament episodes slow down quite a bit, minimizing the narration as we come to focus four full episodes on Jesus of Nazareth, with just the tenth and final episode used to squeeze in the Acts of the Apostles and a hint of Revelation. The Jesus episodes are so-so, but the Acts of the Apostles episode at the end of the series is particularly good, inasmuch as one feels the continuity of watching the same actors from the Jesus episodes. I would have liked to see more of the apostolic martyrdom traditions (particularly Peter) depicted rather than just described by the narrator, but it's really neat to see Acts and Revelation building to a climax with the same actors in the same series. By the end, you really feel like you've sampled the whole Bible, albeit the ""greatest hits"" version. It doesn't feel like 9 hours at all and the last disc of this four-disc set even includes a moving ""Mary, Did You Know?"" music video in addition to a helpful documentary feature.Presentation style is a plus here. The framing device with Noah relating Genesis 1-3 at the start of episode one is clever, reflecting the fact that this primeval history emerges from a symbolic oral storytelling tradition designed to impart religious truth rather than scientific facts. The Hans Zimmer-infused musical score, costumes, and filmmaking all create a theatrical unity to this material. The color-blind casting of the roles (i.e. a black Samson and many middle eastern actors mixed with the British thespians) make the series feel particularly representative of the Middle Eastern melting pot. And the narration by Keith David does a nice job of providing transitions between many stories.On the negative side, one often feels the absence in this show of what is left out from the Bible, wishing the filmmakers had gone for broke by filming a few more episodes. Cutting straight from Abraham to Moses overlooks the story of Jacob (Israel) and his 12 sons, ancestors of the 12 tribes, and of the particularly moving Joseph story of reconciliation among these brothers that concludes Genesis. Ending the Moses episode right when it was getting really exciting is a bummer. And the story of Solomon, or at least of the division of Israel into a northern and southern kingdom under Solomon's son, would have helped alleviate the narrative incoherence of the rushed effort to portray Babylon's conquest of Jerusalem and the story of the prophet Jeremiah. There's no hint here that the northern kingdom, including prophets like Isaiah and Jonah, ever existed. Finally, I wish the series would have at least acknowledged Alexander the Great and the revolt of the Maccabees (subject of Hanukkah) that re-established an independent Jewish kingdom prior to the Roman conquest in 63 BC. Although most Protestant and Jewish Bibles exile the two books of Maccabees to second-canon status, these events would still help us understand the Roman conquest better.This brings me to the only weakness of the series, which is its general unevenness. It tries to squeeze the 46 books of the Old Testament into 5 episodes while spreading out the 27 New Testament books over 5 episodes as well. As a result, the Old Testament episodes gradually feel rushed while the New Testament episodes linger over the gospel accounts of Jesus to the exclusion of much other material.Nevertheless, this series is contemporary enough (John the Baptist has dreds!) and breezy enough (episodes range from 40 to 54 minutes) to be a powerful teaching tool for group study or classroom use. While the excellent TNT Bible Series has richer miniseries teleplays, they tend to be three hours long and frequently padded with extra-biblical material, limiting their classroom use unless one has lots of time to spare. This History Channel series is more like a summary or paraphrase of the Bible, giving us (as the opening scrawl proclaims) the spirit of the text in digestible nuggets rather than word-for-word accuracy. I highly recommend it for teenagers, particularly younger ones, as an entree into the Bible. Older students will want more meat, but this series is more than enough to whet the appetite of spiritual seekers who normally avoid religious material.I revisited this miniseries after seeing ""Son of God"" in theaters and being favorably impressed with its 2 1/2 hour theatrical cut of the 4 hours of Jesus material from the series. To be candid, I found the Jesus material in ""Son of God"" far more compelling than it is in the miniseries, where it is chopped up over four episodes and dramatically weighed down by the omniscient narration. I found it helpful to purchase the full miniseries DVD set for this reason: The last episode on Acts and Revelation, titled ""Courage,"" makes a great epilogue to watching ""Son of God"" on its own! It feels like a 50-minute sequel to the theatrical film, which is particularly valuable since there are no top-notch films on Acts of the Apostles (only miniseries and low-budget stuff) available to buy.The Bible Miniseries take on ""Acts of the Apostles"" is not comprehensive, but it hits the major plot points and grows organically out of the Jesus episodes. With so many creaky older Biblical TV films floating around, it's great to have one portable DVD package with visuals from the whole Bible that hold together well in one narrative. This four-disc DVD set in a thin clamshell case is definitely worth owning if you want a visual taste of scripture.",The Bible: The Epic Miniseries

Well done.The extended version leaves something to be desired as there are no SDH subtitles.  The extended parts are not fully restored.  Why a dupe negative of the long version or at least an original print was not saved when the original negative was edited down for general release is beyond me, but that is Hollywood, absolutely no respect for their own work.  They have inserted photos when the audio exists but no picture elements and subtitles for the words or phrases missing at the beginning and end of the ""trims"" that are reinserted into the print.That is the best we can expect at this time.  Maybe in the future someone will be willing to invest a LARGE amount of money to try to fully restore the cuts that exist and maybe some of the missing pieces will be found but rest assured that you WILL NOT get it for the really NICE price this set is selling for.  Three DVDS and two BDs and all the extras on them are really a bargain in my book.I finally have an answer to question that has bugged me for years.

It's not formatted exactly right for today's widescreen tv's (all the girls look a little wide, which I find oddly comforting) and some of the moves are a little dated. Ripped in 30 definitely is more modern, with better music and an extra workout. But 30 Day Shred is worth it. These workouts are tough. I have done a lot of extreme-style TV workouts like P90X and I still find Jillian's workouts to be very challenging. I also like that they are done in under a half hour from warm up to cool down.

1683980,"Ben Stiller's middle-brow extravaganza almost wasn't his.  They've tried to make this movie for 20 years, and the story of the making of ""The Secret Life of Walter Mitty"" is ultimately more interesting than the movie itself.  Here are some clips from what I call ""The Secret Life of 'The Secret Life of Walter Mitty'"": (roll film!)-- Samuel Goldwyn Jr. came up with the idea in 1994, and Disney was enthusiastic.  Instead,-- New Line Cinema was chosen, because Goldwyn would retain creative input, and because they were on good terms with Jim Carrey, who was the first choice as Mitty-- First screenwriters: Babaloo Mandell, Lowell Ganz-- Ron Howard was first tapped to direct, but he decided to make ""EdTV"" instead-- ""Mitty"" languished for 5 years because no one could figure out how to make the 1939 Thurber story seem contemporary.  Finally, New Line asked Chuck Russell to rewrite the screenplay and direct.  But New Line pushed back the scheduled 2000 release-- In 2001, Goldywn sued New Line for breach of contract, claiming New Line was going to dump the project on another studio and thereby block any ""creative input"" from Goldwyn-- Goldwyn won the suit, taking the project to Paramount-- Paramount was working with DreamWorks on ""Lemony Snicket"", and Spielberg got everyone interested in Jim Carrey again as Mitty-- Spielberg agreed to direct, and brought in DreamWorks to help finance the project (DreamWorks was bought by Paramount in 2006)-- Zach Helm wrote another script-- Spielberg and DreamWorks, however, decided to bail on ""Mitty"" in favor of ""War of the Worlds"" and ""Munich""-- Richard LaGravenese wrote another script, with the stated goal of going ""back to the short story and capture not only the content but the original spirit"", according to Goldwyn's kid John.  (Obviously, our ""Mitty"" isn't the LaGravenese version)-- In 2005, Mark Waters was tapped to direct, but Carrey bailed-- Enter Owen Wilson in the role of ""Mitty""-- Paramount lost the rights because it took too long to make the film.  Owen Wilson bailed over ""creative differences""; Scarlett Johansson was considered for the female lead but she never signed the contract-- Goldwyn took the project to 20th Century Fox in 2007-- Another script rewrite, this time by Jay Kogen, who tailored the script for Mike Myers, who was now tapped for ""Mitty""-- 2010.  Myers gone, Sacha Baron Cohen was announced as ""Mitty"".  Steven Conrad wrote another script (the one we have now, more or less); Gore Verbinski would direct-- 2011.  Ben Stiller was announced as ""Mitty"".  Verbinski gave up direction for a producers's credit, and Stiller himself would directWhew!  Now THAT'S an adventure, more fraught with danger than what Stiller faces in Iceland and Afghanistan in the actual movie.  I spent so much time describing the troubled production history of the movie (which will NOT be included on your Blu-Ray extras, collectors) because there's so little to say about what I just saw.  It's not *bad*, by any means.  Stiller proves himself to be somewhat of a revelation as a director: some of the shots, especially the overhead stuff early in the film at the Time-Life building, and the sequence where Mitty skateboards down a deserted Icelandic highway, are quite stunning.  Sean Penn has a nice moment in a cameo role as The Most Interesting Man in the World.  But this movie isn't the story of Thurber's Walter Mitty, who is a daydreamer and not a doer.  Rather, it's the story of Everyman, seething away in quiet desperation in his cubicle five days a week.  Finally, the shlub goes out and DOES something.  Naturally, the movie has been a smashing success with the 30-55 demographic -- also seething away in cubicles -- to whom it's targeted.  But this new, reimagined Mitty -- ok, this rebooted Mitty, if you must -- doesn't connect on a human level.  He's like a light switch: he's a drone, and then he's Indiana Jones.  He the product of a screenwriter more concerned with getting from Point A to Point B than with creating a real person.But the film is beautifully made, and it's pretty churlish to despise a movie that so firmly believes that travel can make us better people.  I like that message a lot.  3 out of 5, the second star for the quality of the direction, and the third star for the message.",N/A

They are mostly just pretty backgrounds, and not closeups so it's hard to identify where they were shot. Since I lived there, that would have been of interest to me.

509773,"SOME SPOILERS POSSIBLE:I went into this film TOTALLY COLD on opening weekend. All I knew was &#34;Steven Spielberg, Tom Hanks, war movie&#34;, so I figured would be good. What I wasn't expecting was a 25 non-stop recreation of the invasion on D-Day.  An assault on the senses -- the war footage is so incredibly realistic that I was begging for relief.  With the possible exception of &#34;The Thin Red Line&#34; (which has an element of sadism that this film lacks, fortunately), as someone else said, this movie has the most realistic war scenes ever filmed. The viewer is not spared -- the second  most disturbing sequence in the film is an extended sequence of hand-to-hand combat from a unexpected character.If that was it, the film would be dismissible, but the battle scenes frame what gives the watcher a true sense of what it means to be a soldier. The characters are are written and performed very realistically, as well. After seeing the film, I understood much, much better what the veterans went through, the traumas they endured and had to carry with them, their courage, and why so many of them were outraged at the Vietnam War protests (although they might have missed the apples-and-oranges nature of the two wars, but that's not a topic to explore here).I don't now if saying I enjoyed the film would be a good way to explain my reaction, but it is excellent. A masterpiece that totally achieves what Spielberg intended it to. He and Tom Hanks, who plays the Captain of the squad that is assigned to retrieve Private Ryan, really should have won Oscars that year. The movie, I'm sure, loses a lot of impact on the small screen, but if my son ever says he's thinking about the Armed Forces, we'll be watching this together.

But he was only in the movie for a good half hour before they killed him off. which I understood what they did there because they had to incorporate Orlando Bloom into the mix, and he would eventually become a huge deal, by being the defender of Jerusalem and the one who officially surrendered  the city to save his people.this movie is 5 stars no problem for me, the story I thought was excellent and I really enjoyed the actual fighting scenes, it go very gory very fast... but like I said I haven't seen a good movie of this genre in quite awhile, because I was mildly disappointed with &#34;300 Rise of an Empire&#34;. being the movie freak that I am, I took a trip to F.Y.E to take a look at what they had in the used section of the store.

There are really no redeeming characters other than the lead, most of the time you'll be begging to see the characters killed quickly. The movie is also very dark, now I don't mean tonally or the humor, I mean there were times I was staring at a black screen wondering what was happening. One thing I do give them credit for is not prolonging the action like most horror movies that wait 45 mins before anything of merit begins. The gore wasn't anything to brag about, it wasn't over the top but nothing really memorable either, except the &#34;blender scene&#34;. I'm sure the masks were meant to be clever, the hunted becoming the hunters, but on screen they look like something you'd buy at walmart for a kids Halloween party. The twist was nice it wasn't forced in and the end it was slid in midway with really no foreshadowing which is rare these days.

879175,"I found this 1967 war film watchable, but nothing else. Below, more of my impressions, with some SPOILERS.This film describes the fight for a large island during Pacific War and follows the tribulations of one company of USMC and their Japanese adversaries. The place of action is never named, we just know that the beach on which this one company lands is code named ""Red"". The island is however very large and as we know also that the initial stage of Bougainville Campaign (November-December 1943) is already over, the battle described here could be that of Saipan (June-July 1944) or Guam (July-August 1944).The film begins with the landing itself, which is opposed immediately on the beaches and costs Americans some casualties - but is nowhere near as hellish as the legendary slaughters on Tarawa or on Omaha Beach. Some reviewers claimed that this film inspired the initial sequences from ""Saving Private Ryan"", but it is unlikely - the intensity of the landing fight in ""Beach Red"" is far, far lesser than in Spielberg's master-piece.After the initial battle the Marines move inland, meeting first an improvised line of defense with machine gun nests and then a more substantial obstacle, with pillboxes made in concrete (like on Saipan). That battle is tougher and American tanks get involved - and then we enter the jungle, with all its deadly attractions...Cornel Wilde, who directed this film, was inspired by a novella published under the same title in 1945 by a veteran of Pacific War, but this being the Vietnam War era he changed the general tone in order to turn his film into an anti-war manifesto - and that didn't do this movie any good. Elements of rather crude and simplistic psychological analysis were added in form of soldier's reminiscences of their families at home, like in the much earlier, lavishly budgeted and stars-stiffed ""Halls of Montezuma"" - and exactly like in this former film, here they are more ridiculous than anything else...Cornel Wilde plays also here the main role of captain MacDonald, the commanding officer of the whole company - but honestly, a great actor he was not and I found his performance rather weak and as the result his character was not very credible. I already had the occasion to notice the same thing in other Wilde's film, ""Constantin and the Cross""... Other actors were unknown to me, but they did better, with especially Rip Torn playing very well a tough USMC NCO, Sergeant Honeywell.There is a lot of fighting in this film and most of those fighting scenes were good, with the initial landing and the fight agains pillboxes being the best. This film was turned on Philippines and local army gave considerable help, including some M-41 Walker Bulldogs light tanks, which albeit posterior to WWII can to some extent pretend to be long-gunned versions of M-4 Shermans...On another hand the portrayal of the Japanese was rather substandard. In an attempt to show the preparation for a ""banzai"" charge Wilde mustered hundreds of Philippino soldiers - but they all wear old American uniforms and M1903 Springfield rifles and as result those scenes are not very credible... Also, Wilde decided against subtitling in English what Japanese are saying and therefore had to ask the ""officers"" to gesticulate a lot so the viewer can understand what is it that they mean - the final result is rather pathetic and weird as the Japanese in this film use their hands to communicate a little like cavemen in ""Quest for Fire""...The portrayal of Pacific War and soldiers who wage it are in this film considerably influenced by the anti-war Vietnam-era ideology - and that anachronism hurts this film a lot, mostly by eliminating all kind of humour. There are only two very short scenes in which any humour is present - the rest of the film is mostly fighting and preaching about how bad it is to fight...Only one scene in this film was really great and moved me a lot - it shows two critically wounded soldiers, one Japanese and one American. They fell very close one to another, there is nobody else alive around and they both are aware that they are dying... That was a really good one.But some good fighting and a couple of other nice scenes nonobstant, this is ultimately a rather average film. Watchable, but nothing more.",N/A
1071707,"While the film is undeniably assembled in an original and inventive manner, the movie is ultimately a failure for its lack of scares and its inability to cohesively tie all its narrative strings together.The movie tells the story of a family's dark tragedy, but presents their plight in two concurrent narratives: the past and the present. Nimbly jumping between both eras, the movie nicely splices together the parallel timelines to highlight their eerie similarities. The older version of the protagonist will enter a room and suddenly become her younger self. Certainly the editing and writing from that perspective elevate this film to a more artistic affair.Unfortunately, that's where the cleverness stops. Were this an indie art-house film, the nonlinear efforts might be more laudable. But as a horror film, it cannot salvage an otherwise weak outing. Despite the film's intelligent framing, the story proper devolves into trite and uninteresting cliches from the horror genre. Why the heroes are even embarking of their quest makes no sense either. Though the heroine looks directly at a camera to literally explain her motivations and mission, the &#34;experiment&#34; they conduct is extremely contrived and nonsensical, a poor excuse to drive the narrative. The final resolution is quite tame and unsatisfying too, infuriating those who invested themselves in getting to the truth of the mystery.A final affront comes from its misleading R-rating. As most commercial horror films are sanitized with a PG-13 version to draw the largest theater-going audience, this film is inexplicably rated R. However, the dearth of scares and fright does not warrant this more adult rating, as the film still feels like a watered-down PG-13. It's odd enough to almost feel like the marketers were intentionally mislabeling the film to draw in the more hardcore horror fans.",N/A

She brings along her ex-boyfriend and and two other chums to check out her new digs. They are greeted by a strange war veteran who is, or is not, the caretaker of the home in question. What follows is a story of lost memory, apparent child abuse, and a killer/lover relationship with the main character. The flashbacks of lost memories tries to tell the viewer the back-story, however, the sudden flashes of familial abuse and bible verse spewing are trite and actually confuse the underlying, slow decay of the overall story.The ending is annoying at best.

1433099,"Sands of the KalahariDirector: Cy EndfieldProducer: Joe LevineWritten: William Melvihill, Cy EndfieldStuart WhitmanStanley BakerSusannah YorkHarry AndrewsTheodore BikelNigel DavenportThis is a fascinating tale of a fight for survival at one of the most inhospitable locations: the Kalahari.  Not that it is the perfect film, but it is standing strong as one of my top favorite movies of all time.  This movie is also very believable, and I found myself so absorbed in the story that my neck hairs were on end.  As men fought men, baboons, antelope, birds, tortoises, I couldn't help wonder how this one would end.  The tortuous reality of this film is loud as the growling baboons.The story is a flight delay in South Africa causes five people to charter a twin engine beachcraft to make a flight to Nairobi.  After a time the flight encounters a huge swarm of locusts and goes down.  Six survive, one well armed.  The group spots a black mountain 30 miles off and they make for it.  Once there they find water, set up camp, and the battle for survival begins.A couple of comments to get off my chest before I pay homage to a very good film. In the beginning, the music was awful. The score sounded like a rusty merry-go-round.  Second, the pilot should have circled for altitude in attempt to overtop  the locusts.  They were only loud and clear on the radar.  Third Grace Munkton gets sexually assulted by the pilot.  At least she could punch him in the face as he treated her so brutally, not sob ""do what ever you want to me!"" Get mad, Grace.I rest my case.  Don't get me wrong this is still a stunning on location movie.  This movie is not about love.  There is an uncomfortable lack of love in this movie and it makes you suffer with the characters in their isolation.  Grace gets a crush on O'brien and confesses some love for him as an armed, handsome man, but he only mumbles something about not wanting her.  O'brian comes round to  a bit of affection for Grace on the condition they not play games.  I didn't see any games, but O'brian seems to be changing.  Indeed there is hardly a civil conversation with one of the other men.  He virtually slaughters the baboons, and becomes blaming and grumpy with the others.  That turns to contempt as they manage to wound an eland. He becomes like a bullying child at this point.What follows as the eland is surrounded is an intense fight, seemingly as real as it gets.Whitman is perfect for O'brian's role and he is very effective. Whitman begins to steal the entire film.  One is hard pressed to imagine a more perfect fit between a man and his role.I was simply compelled to watch because this is a movie about survival, harsh and bare.  The men are all changing as they realize they are trapped on a black rock and running out of food with little hope of rescue.  Earlier Nigel has made an attempt to reach civilization.  Out of his head he makes it to the coast but is only taken away by mining authorities and presumably locked up. We don't see him again.O'brian seemingly half crazed for fear of starving or being attacked by the baboons begins sending other men in his group away at gunpoint claiming food shortage.  Losing his judgement he demands men he sends into the desert come back to rescue him. A man sent to the desert at gunpoint doesn't organize a rescue party.  Eventually there is only O'brian the savage killer, the others rescued by helicopter.  In time his hair grows down his back and he runs out of ammunition.  The baboons move in to surround him.  Classic movie. GJ",N/A

Dame Judi Dench did an outstanding job portraying someone moving into and through Alzheimer's disease.  Having had multiple relatives who were afflicted with this, I can say that this was one of the most accurate portrayals I have seen on film.  Jim Broadbent, as the older John Bayley, won high accolades for his work in this film, but I think Hugh Bonneville, as the younger John Bayley, was equally terrific in the role.  Kate Winslet rounded out the leading cast playing the young Iris.  There are some nude scenes with Winslet and material not suited for youth.

Much of the show's gentle humor derived from UNCLE JOE's lame brained get rich quick schemes, the family's LASSIE smart pooch and KATE's three nearly grown daughters, blonde BILLIE JO (portrayed by three actresses, including two future HEE HAW HONEYS and MEREDITH MACCRAE), brunette BOBBIE JO (PAT WOODELL, then LORI SAUNDERS) and redheaded BETTY JO (HENNING's daughter LINDA KAYE). Neither as over the top as THE BEVERLY HILLBILLIES nor as surreal as GREEN ACRES, HENNING's other sixties smashes, PETTICOAT JUNCTION proved the perfect place to stop and put your feet up for seven sublime seasons.RETURN TO HOOTERVILLE is a nicely done, nostalgic documentary hosted by LINDA KAYE HENNING; the many extras include a warm tribute to BEA BENEDERET by her son actor JACK BANNON, her guest star shot on THE DANNY KAYE SHOW and a behind the scenes look at THE CANNONBALL.RATING: FOUR SAM DRUCKERS",Petticoat Junction: Return to Hooterville

1695571,"Even for a Scy Fy Channel production, this film was dreadful. Somehow the lack of production value and the stupefied performances were supposed to make this into a comedy. There was nothing funny about it. From the lack luster effects to the nonexistent sets to the tragically witless script, the director started with a steaming  pile of it. And that was what he cooked up and served. The only thing missing was a side order of dead rats to choke down with and extra large mud milk shake. I like low budget movies. I like monster movies. There is nothing more monstrous than bad film making disguised as comedy. I suppose a really hateful teacher could inflict this on a class as to how NOT to write, direct, or act, in a movie.

1692959,"This topical show's biggest strength is it's honest portrayal of real gay men. Both the heterosexual stereotypes and our own don't apply here. This piece is about gay men single or not,who while they are fit and attractive, are not relentless body nazis. And (gasp) some of them are getting older in a youth obsessed culture. While it is topical and current many of the scenarios that play out her are timeless. The main character, subtlety played by Groth, often makes missteps in finding Mr. Right or even just Mr. Right now (he seems to be on Both sides of the fence). There is a couple who surprises themselves by bringing a third party in for a threesome. The best character for me, as a man of a certain age, is played by Bartlett. He can't seem to let go of how he was acting as a twenty five year old. All of these characters and situations ring true. And this series relevance brings to mind the old adage ""the more things may change the more they stay the same.if you need to have a frame of reference for this piece, view Andrew Heigh's movie weekend, I highly recommend it.",N/A

321843,"There isn't much to say about this film. Its main reason for existing is the star power of Jeanette MacDonald and Alan Jones. Judging from the reviews, Jones fans and MacDonald fans were mainly attracted by the presence of their star and didn't know all that much about the other star. The plot sounds like it could have some meat to it -- MacDonald as a Spanish spy among French and Jones as the French counterspy sent to find and trap her -- but there is no real suspense. The relationship between Jones and MacDonald develops in the usual manner with Jeanette at first scornful towards her unwanted suitor, but gradually warming up as she falls for his charm.Of course the reason to see the film is for the musical performances. Coming from the MacDonald camp, Alan Jones was just pleasant. He sang his songs in a pleasing way, but not so I would have suspected him of being a considerable star.Jeanette MacDonald had top billing and really dominated the film with her very lively singing and dancing. Ultimately the principal attraction of the film is as one of the best showcases of her great talent.",The Firefly VHS

1631329,"There are a number of movies that come out each year put into the hands of a marketing team that then turn around and make you believe you're watching one type of movie when it's actually another. Confused yet? Okay let's consider this. The horror genre is making major inroads into mass culture. No longer are horror films the once in a blue moon genre but more often they're the main thing playing. So if a movie has horrific elements a marketing team highlights those even if the movie isn't really a horror film at all. Take YOU'RE NEXT for example.The movie opens with a man and woman attacked in a home invasion that really has little to do with the plot other than to establish the villains, a group that wears animal masks and brutally kills the couple. It moves from there to a family reunion of sorts in a secluded, wooded area. First to arrive are mom and dad, both apparently retired and looking forward to the weekend getaway with the now grown kids.First to arrive is Crispian, a teacher and his girlfriend Erin. Not as successful as he had hoped, it becomes a sore point later on with his more successful brother. As the story unfolds you realize that there are many unresolved issues between various family members but that is nothing compared to what they will soon face.The next day the rest of the family arrives in the form of older brother Drake, their sister and younger brother Felix and his new girlfriend. The low level bickering begins and culminates at the dinner table with Drake insulting his sister's new boyfriend. When the boyfriend goes over to the window to look outside glass is shattered, he turns and we see an arrow sticking out of his chest. The movie turns from a family convergence to a home invasion film unlike any other.Unable to cope with the reality of what's going on it is Erin that saves the day and calls out instructions to the rest in an attempt to stave off the attackers. While the invaders might have planned on this family falling apart they had no clue what they would get in Erin. The family is forced to come together on a basic level if they are going to survive this. Traps have been set, some invaders have already been hidden in the house and the only ones armed seem to be the bad guys.So what we're presented with here is more of a thriller, along the lines of something Alfred Hitchcock might have made were he alive today. Even more so as things begin to slowly unspool with each minute of the film and we learn why this is happening and just who is behind it. To say the final revelation is not one most will see coming doesn't do it justice. And now that I've said that don't watch expecting to find clues easily as to that ending. Just know once they start to come, more follow.The movie will keep you on the edge of your seat throughout even though it takes a short time to get going. But then if you don't establish the players here nothing makes sense. Even the early portrayal of Erin as a student aid who seems to be pretty frail is turned upside down along with many other characters in the movie.At first glimpse one could mistake this for the torture porn films that I've come to loathe over the past few years. Be glad that this doesn't fall into that genre at all. Instead it's a white knuckle ride that grabs you by the throat and doesn't let go until the final credits roll. Top notch acting, a solid story, great effects and some smooth camerawork make this film one that will stick in your memory come bed time. What more could you ask for from a thriller?",You're Next

This is a simple story about a man, played impeccably by Burt Lancaster, who decides to swim home across his neighbors' swimming pools for no particular reason that we are aware of.  On the way he revisits his own flawed and failed past.  Failed career.  Failed relationships.  Failed marriage.  No, it's not his past.  It's the present.  No, wait, it's his future.  Burt is as baffled by them as I am.  Why is everyone so cruel and uncaring toward me?  Why could I have done to make them so harsh and unforgiving?  He can't remember.  He doesn't understand.  But it doesn't matter.  Nothing matters but swimming home.  Is he living in a timeless present where the past and the future do not exist?  This is a film you will not be able to forget.  It will make you reflect on your life like no other film I have ever known.  It is a film that I am afraid to watch and that I never want to end.  And the ending.  Oh, the ending.

But I thought it was a fun ride of a comic book film, Hemsworth & Hiddleston have grown in their roles as Thor & Loki & share a  charming chemistry with each other, that gives you the feeling that they really are brothers. Natalie Portman as Jane Foster is also great adding that romantic element, along with the magic meets sci-fi adventure. For those that complained that there wasn't enough of Asgard in the first film, you won't be disappointed this time around. The golden city looks beautiful & there are peeks at some of the other nine realms as well. Although it was great to have a touch of Walt Simonson's classic characters added, Malekith & the Dark Elves were a little disappointing as the villains.

666090,"The Simpsons.... This show can arguably be considered the best show ever on TV! Been around since 1989 and still going strong! Starting out as short clips on the Tracy Ullman Show, The Simpsons are now one of the most popular and recognizable shows throughout the world! And this is the season that started it all.This season contains 13 amazing and memorable episodes that won an Emmy award and had 4 additional nominations. Some of my personal favs that stick out is &#34;Bart the General&#34; where Bart is bullied at school every day and is tired of it and rallies other school kids that are bullied as well fight back with an army like strategy water balloon attacks. &#34;The Telltale Head&#34; Where Bart vandalizes a town statue by decapitating it and causing the town to form an angry mob as Bart and Homer try to figure out how to get out of that mess. Also who can forget the very first episode &#34;Simpsons Roasting on an Open Fire&#34; the first Christmas with the Simpsons and all of the bonus money for X-mas is spent to remove a tattoo that Bart decided to get. Looking like there was not going to be a Christmas that year, instead they add a great addition to the Simpson family with Santa's Little Helper. This season is a great addition to any Simpson fan!Some of the special features include outtakes, early sketches and magazine covers. BBC Special: America's First Family, and Commentary on the episodes. The commentaries are great features for the hardcore fans and are a lot of fun to check out even if you're not a big fan. Overall this is a great season to get if you are deciding to just get one(or one for now.) This really won't matter if you decide to get them all like a hardcore fan(like myself, and proud of it!)

Helen Hunt, on the other hand, seemed much more natural in her role, both thanks to her acting and the script...no fear of head injuries there.

Initially driven by simple curiosity, he goes to the scene of the crime to get some background information.  It is then that he finds genuine inconsistencies in what happened a few years back.  With less than a day to prove that an innocent man is about to be executed, he gives it his all to find what he needs to save the man's life.  Some might say that it's rather far-fetched as to how the reporter determined the condemned man might be innocent...really, no one previously considered things like the store's layout being different then described?  I would agree were it not for the 140+ real-life individuals who were sent to Death Row and later exonerated.  Unfortunately, I buy the circumstances in this film and they were pretty interesting circumstances.  While this film may not be able to hold up in comparison to films like Dead Man Walking or The Green Mile, it's still a film worth watching.  Clint Eastwood is lively throughout as the alcoholic reporter trying to do the right thing.  I did think that Isaiah Washington and Lisa Gay Hamilton, who played the condemned man's wife, were a bit bland.  It's possible that the weight of the situation overcame them, but shouldn't there be some emotion throughout this grim process?  And did they have to kill Mary McCormack's character off so quickly?  Yes, it's what happened in the book, but its Mary McCormack...give her just a few more lines.  This is a fine film to watch, especially if you liked the book it was based on.  Enjoy.",True Crime VHS

1481926,"The Expendables was an enjoyable ride, for what it was, Stallone certainly knows how to go after action, there's no doubt about it, it's what he does. I was hoping the sequel would be equally enjoyable but it's a bit lackluster compared to the original. Action is still aggressive and the forefront but overall the film feels shallower than its predecessor. I would say it's an average action film, which is why I have decided to give it a 3/5 stars. Remember, I am an avid film lover, so things do not need to be perfect for me to enjoy a movie, I appreciate them for what they are. If I'm going to watch an action film then I expect there to be quality action sequences, the rest is icing on the cake. Critical viewers may rate this film lower than I have. If you're a fan of Expendables #1 then you will certainly enjoy The Expendables 2, it's just not as good.",N/A

For if the Germans acquire the headpiece, they will be able to locate the lost Ark of the Covenant with its mysterious powers.

Also, the music by the great John Williams is unforgettable.Photography was in France, Tunisia, Hawaii, and studios in England.The title of this movie was originally ""Raiders of the Lost Ark"" but was later changed for marketing purposes.This film originated from George Lucas' desire to create a modern version of the serials of the 1930s and 1940s.The budget for this movie was eighteen million dollars.

466068,"After watching a ton of Disney Treasure sets, this second collection of Ub Iwerks early cartoons may not be of the same quality as his efforts with Disney, but they are certainly worth the time of any animation history buff. At a bargain price, this set features 26 cartoons and for the most part they look very good, with most of the wear being at the beginning of each short during titles and the first 30 seconds or so of the shorts. Have they been remastered? .....probably not, but besides a little wear here and there, they are presented uncut and look pretty clear and not washed out. The only exception is to Hell's Fire which has a caption before the cartoon starts that states :these are the last remaining fragments of the cartoon that have survived"". This cartoon runs well over 5 minutes, so I can't imagine too much is missing....at least they included what has survived and they don't try to pass it off as a complete short.Like the first set, this one volume two still has the basic menu with my only gripe, the menu could have used a little work to make it a little more user friendly. You can play all the cartoons or look at the scene selection for individual titles, but once you start the cartoon from any point, it will play all from that point. Meaning you have to stop after each cartoon and go to the menu if you want to skip around and see selected shorts. It's not a huge deal, but it could have been easily fixed with a few adjustments.Is it worth buying, absolutely! it has 26 rare shorts that may never look any better or be released again. At a tad under $10.00(or cheaper if you look around), you get a nice collection of cartoons from a man who was a pioneer in animation. The shorts are not the best he produced, but I enjoyed these cartoons very much.","Cartoons That Time Forgot - The Ub Iwerks Collection, Vol. 2"
1690886,"Apparently it's no longer politically correct in Hollywood to be pro-American.  Now every, otherwise enjoyable, film has to be ruined with both subtle and not so subtle jabs at how awful America is, at how terribly we treat the rest of the world, at how imperialistic and prideful we are, and how we think we're better than all other countries.I find it both interesting and sad, since while I was growing up people were genuinely proud of America and proud to be American and we did think that America was the greatest country on earth (I still do).  But now, apparently it's &#34;wrong&#34; to be patriotic.So every film has to be turned into a sermon and an object lesson about the &#34;evils&#34; of America.

1257517,"I'd been waffling on upgrading this set on bluray for a while. I bought the individual sets some time ago and the upscaling through my bluray player was &#34;good enough&#34; for a long time. After reading some reviews, and waiting for a good price here on Amazon, I pulled the trigger on a purchase and haven't regretted it. The upscaling through the player is good enough picture wise that I wouldn't complain if I had to watch the DVDs, but the biggest difference is the sound quality. Understand, the picture is all around better with the actual bluray version, the colors are bright and bold and the line quality is sharp. Actually, it's even too sharp in some instances as the lines can appear jagged at times. In and of itself it isn't bad, it's just that the picture is so enhanced you can see every pixel at times. So, just something to be aware of as the few times that happens it can be jarring at first.The sound quality is amazing, especially in episode 4 when you have all kinds of radio chatter flowing back and forth switch from the Dedanan to the units in the tunnel to the mole in the hotel room. You feel like you're right there in each location as the audio switches and the clarity (or lack there of given which location is playing the audio) is top notch.All of the extras that I've watched from the individual DVD sets are there from the trailers to the video logs. The only things that this set lacks were the individual books that came with the DVD sets. Those were FANTASTIC and included a wealth of information that you cannot get anywhere else. Everything from character sketches to details on the weapons, the arm slaves and the equipment used in the series were in those books and they are simply amazing. I kept all of them when I traded in the DVD sets because those books are phenomenal and if you're a FMP fan you should try to get all four of them as they really enhance the set by giving you a wealth of background information. I wish they were included in the bluray set, but alas they are not. I also wish I could have fit them in the bluray case, but they are DVD size so they don't fit which is a shame, but I know they won't get lost regardless.All in all this is a great product and well worth the purchase.

412029,"""The Glory Guys"" is actually two Westerns in one. On the one hand, the film boasts an insightful script by Sam Peckinpah that explores the dilemma a junior army officer faces when he realizes his commanding officer is letting personal emotions overcome the commander's better military judgment, placing the troops in their brigade in unnecessary danger. On the other hand, the film also features the standard silly plot complications of a 60s action film: a hackneyed love triangle and knockdown barroom brawls.The movie is a thinly disguised fictionalization of George Custer's Little Big Horn campaign, as told from the standpoint of junior officers. In the film, an army general (Andrew Duggan in the Custer role) prepares his command to take part in a major offensive with several other units against the Indians, with the stated objective of forcing them onto the reservation. In reality, Duggan is out for personal glory and wants his command alone to deal the decisive blow to the Indians. Tom Tryon plays a captain (a fictionalized version of Custer subordinates Major Reno and Captain Benteen) who served under Duggan previously and transferred out of the general's command following an earlier battle in which the general deliberately sacrificed a company of poorly trained recruits to draw the Indians out. Now, Duggan has pulled strings to get Tryon transferred back and orders him to train some more new recruits for the upcoming offensive.I'm guessing that Peckinpah's original script for ""Glory Guys"" emphasized the battle of wills between Tryon and Duggan, as Tryon tries to be the professional soldier and train his troops, even as he realizes that Duggan does not intend to take part in a coordinated attack but, instead, rush his troops into battle on their own. It's a theme that Peckinpah would explore in greater depth in his next script, ""Major Dundee,"" a film he also directed. The scenes pitting Duggan and Tryon are by far the best dramatic scenes in the film. Unfortunately, only bits and pieces of these themes find their way into the finished movie. Instead, the film, as directed by Arnold Laven (primarily a TV director), is pretty much routine studio fare.Instead of spending most of his time squabbling with his commanding officer, Tryon spends most of his time vying with the general's chief scout (Harve Presnell) for the affection of a local widow (Senta Berger). This romantic triangle is quite tiresome and very predictable (any viewer who's ever seen a 60s Western can guess within five minutes after Presnell's character is introduced how it will turn out). ""Glory Guys"" also stints on depicting the troops' training. All viewers get to see are a couple of scenes of them taking target practice and trying to ride, all the while being browbeaten by Tryon, who continually berates them (supposedly, this type of ""tough love"" is needed to get them into shape, but the movie doesn't devote enough time to the training to make it realistic). With so little time devoted to the troops, nearly all of them are interchangeable bit players. The only two soldiers given any depth are two more Western stereotypes, the loud mouthed Irishman (James Caan) and the innocent young kid (Michael Anderson, Jr.) in love with an equally innocent town girl.""Glory Guys"" does devote plenty of screen time to showing a couple of those incredibly fake brawls in which everyone gets a goofy look on their face when an opponent's wild haymaker punch lands, people get knocked through doors and windows a lot, and entire rooms of furniture gets smashed, but no one is the worse for wear other than a couple of bruises. All in all, the brawls are about as convincing and entertaining as a backyard wrestling league battle royal.Eventually, ""Glory Guys"" features  a major battle between the cavalry and the Indians, and, the sequence is quite well staged. Back then, studio productions employed plenty of extras and sizable numbers of troops on each side in a major battle and the money spent and attention paid to detail show here. The sequence lasts about twenty minutes and is exciting throughout, while, at the same time, easy for viewers to follow. Although anyone familiar with Custer's final campaign knows how the battle will turn out (and how the movie will end), the high level of realism in the combat sequence helps the movie maintain as much suspense as possible.For the most part, ""Glory Guys"" is indistinguishable from dozens of other Westerns of that era, albeit with stars Tryon and Presnell having considerable less screen presence than the leads of most comparable A-level Westerns (when Peckinpah did finally make ""Major Dundee,"" he was working with Charlton Heston and Richard Harris). It's probably no coincidence that the movie marked the end of both Tryon's and Presnell's career as leading men. Fortunately, the film has a first rate set piece finale and enough well-written dramatic tension in some of the earlier scenes for me to give it a mild recommendation. However, there's just not enough glory here to warrant a better rating.",Glory Guys VHS

1248717,"I know I've seen better movies but not ones I love more. I love &#34;Dear John&#34; and all its riffs. When I was in the eighth grade, I read &#34;Gone With the Wind&#34; for the first time. Over the next few years I read it a total of five times, mainly seeking a different ending, but, of course, there isn't one. &#34;Frankly, I don't give a damn&#34; will always be that last retort. However, a different ending does occur in &#34;Dear John&#34; and I watch the movie just to see it again and again.Besides, the beautiful Channing Tatum and the gorgeous Amanda Seigfried make up the good-looking couple who bond almost immediately in the story. The way he touches her, the way she looks at him just seem so real (or I want it to be real). Tenderness, gentility, thoughtfulness braid through the story, revealing through both their characters.In three weeks the &#34;summer romance&#34; ends: she goes back to college, he returns to duty in the Middle East. Before they part, they decide to write of their lives in their letters, to continue to develop on paper what they cannot in flesh. Their words of choice in parting: &#34;See you soon then?&#34;It's not an easy romance. One thing after the other interrupts this distance relationship, all good reasons, all understandable. Yet, still, everything is on hold. How long can such a love last? Additionally, John's father is autistic; Savannah's longtime neighbor male friend also has an autistic son. All play roles in this love story.Tears, tears, tears--after all, this is a Nicholas Sparks story. However, let me declare now, neither of the main characters dies. When the ending comes, it comes quietly, gently, and so understated. Perfect!  It's not a perfect love story, but it is most assuredly a worthy one!",Dear John

1356002,"If it were not for Pal Joey,I'd give this collection 5 stars.  I consider that movie to be a total waste of time as Frank Sinatra simply plays himself, Rita Hayworth ditto and Kim Novak was wasted on the role.  PICNIC is well done but there are touches of definite Stage Play  in it.  Most of the dialogue for stage plays does not transfer well to the screen as it usually seems artificial.  What fits on the stage does not fit well in a movie.  And, one is always conscious that there is no way that this story can end well for Madge.  Holden is too old for the role and is trying to hard to fit it.  He does a good job and one can imagine that the way he has lived his life simply aged him beyond his years.  He certainly conveys well the fact that he is a supreme egotist who is using his charm on a very young girl in order to boost his own ego and isn't even aware of that fact.  I imagine if their story had been continued, it would wind up like the book Show Boat where the man abandons her when he can't take care of her.  One knows at the end as she boards the bus smiling that she will wind up getting off that bus a year or so later much wiser.  Rosalind Russell, as usual, chews the scenery way too much, no subtlety there.  JEANNE EAGELS is certainly worth seeing and Novak does a great job.  The last part where she does nothing but drink and destroy herself gets tiresome.  It is never fully explained why she is so self destructive except that the old actress whose play she stole committed suicide.  BELL,BOOK AND CANDLE is a charmer and beautifully photographed. It's not meant to be anything but entertainment and it is certainly that. It's delightful beginning to end.  My favorite is MIDDLE OF THE NIGHT.  It's another story that at the end you are saying to yourself This Can't End Well.  If you look ahead in their story, what on earth is she going to do in a new life married to this man nearly 3 times her age.  She is simply too inexperienced and immature to deal with what is coming in that life.  But, it's a wonderful story, well told, well acted and they didn't sugar coat it by casting someone buff and handsome in the Fredric March role.  He looks and acts 56.

233695,"I LOVE YOU, ALICE B. TOKLAS! (1968) (94 minutes).  A half-forgotten nearly 50 year old comedy from the Peter Sellers catalog that deserves another look.  As written by Paul Mazursky and Larry Tucker, and helmed by Hy Averback, this Los Angeles-based biting satire stars  Sellers as a prim, middle-aged Jewish lawyer, a self-admitted 30-something square who decides to "" turn on, tune in, drop out,"" as they used to say.  He jilts his fianc&eacute;e and embraces the 1960s counterculture after falling for a nubile flower child.Sellers (THE PINK PANTHER, DR. STRANGELOVE), plays Harold Fine, whose dull existence gives way to the hippie lifestyle. Almost immediately after free-spirited Nancy, (Leigh Taylor-Young, PEYTON PLACE), enters his world and unleashes his inhibitions with spiked brownies. Joyce Van Patten, (GROWNUPS, MARLEY AND ME), as Joyce, Harold's secretary/fianc&eacute;e; and Jo Van Fleet, (COOL LAND LUKE, GUNFIGHT AT OK CORRAL, and one tough mother in EAST OF EDEN), as Harold's mother provide fine support.  You should see them bust out into belly laughs after eating the spiked brownies.  David Arkin plays Harold's brother Herbie; Herb Edelman plays Harold's law partner Murray.  Grady Sutton puts in a delicious turn as the funeral director more than inconvenienced by a lightning strike of hearse drivers.First thing to say about this movie, it's still funny, though perhaps it shows a different, more muted side of its star's comic powers.  Second outstanding fact, along with EASY RIDER, THE GRADUATE, GEORGY GIRL, BLOWUP and Elaine May's HEARTBREAK KID,  made in 1971, a couple of years later, it is an accurate portrayal of the time it was made.  That would be the turbulent, now near mythical 1960s, the decade of sex, drugs and rock and roll.  I've never heard the word ""groovy"" used so many times in my long life.  And you should see the hilarious getup of Joyce's bridesmaids in the scenes of her aborted marriage to Harold.I actually saw this movie back then in real time when it came out, and don't think I've seen it again since then, until now.  But I do remember musing, even back then, on how short the cinema life of a flavor of the month young actress can be.  There's Taylor-Young with her--get this, ONE tattoo, on her OUTER  THIGH, how daring.  A butterfly, which Sellers identifies as a Monarch.  To dip into the Jewish vernacular, it wouldn't help.  Didn't help Taylor-Young, who soon disappeared from film.  And, I was struck on a re-viewing of the film by just how biting the satire is.  Some may think the Jewish satire is over-the-top, though of course Sellers, and much of the other talent before and behind the camera was Jewish, and I suppose that influenced the picture's content.  Furthermore, today's Hispanic viewers might be offended by some of the content.  Fine is representing the 11-member Rodriguez family in an auto accident case: one morning they all troop into his office, grand-dad down to the kiddies, wearing neck braces.  And the lawyerly Harold points out that all 11 of them were in the car, a clear violation of local law.  And, in addition, there were chickens in the car, an even clearer violation of local law.  Well, the movie's still funny.  You might want to take another look at it if you too saw it way back then.  Or a first look if you enjoy Peter Sellers' work.",I Love You Alice B Toklas VHS

420531,"The only reason my favorite movie from my childhood gets a star less is because this version is represented in full screen and actually cuts off some of the peripheral content because of the transfer from VHS to DVD.  This version is also not in HD or Blu-Ray so your wider screen TVs will more than likely fuzz the details a little.  However, unlike some reviews, this does not ruin the movie which is, by far, a cult classic of the Rick Moranis generation and for kids that grew up during the time.Rick Moranis plays an inventor with two kids next to the polar opposite family next door, also with two kids.  When a freak baseball accident gets Wayne's (Moranis) shrinking machine to work, it also accidentally fires off and shrinks a chair, a couch, and the four kids.  They get displaced by Wayne cleaning up the area after taking his aggressions on his supposedly not working machine.  This displacement puts them in a trash bag at the other end of the backyard.  The four kids have to depend on each other to cross the equivalent of 3.1 miles where blades of grass are the size of trees, butterflies have a wingspan of over 40 feet, and water droplets become hazards.Mixed in with adventure and drama, this comedy has won the hearts of millions and is worth the five dollars if you are willing to deal with the size of the display.","Honey, I Shrunk the Kids VHS"

1693519,"I have so many swirling issues with a film like &#8216;Stranger by the Lake&#8217;, so deciding where to start in the context of a review is difficult.  I guess I could map out the film&#8217;s plot first, which will take all of three seconds.  Franck is cruising the gay side of a lake, looking for a hookup when he meets Henri, a fat and lonely man who sits alone awaiting someone to talk to.  They become friends.  Then Franck sees Michel, an attractive and mysterious man and he&#8217;s hooked.  When Franck literally watches Michel murder someone at the lake, he becomes even more entranced and delves deep into a sexual relationship, despite the police swarming the scene looking for answers to the murder.The problem with this is that none of this is even remotely interesting.  The sex, violence and suspense are just dull.There are literally two things that I enjoyed about this film.  Patrick D'Assumao is really, really good as Henri.  His scenes with Pierre Deladonchamps (who plays Franck) are the only glimpses into any sort of backstory or point to this film, but they are sadly too few.  Also, the final frames, that climax (pun intended) is exceptionally directed.I&#8217;m done.The heap of praise that this film has received has baffled me a bit.  I&#8217;ve debated this with some friends who don&#8217;t feel as I do, and I still cannot bring myself to get their point, even though I kind of want to (who wants to be the odd man out).  Still, as much as they defend this, I find myself more and more convinced that it doesn&#8217;t work.  I am one who often praises minimalism, but &#8216;Stranger by the Lake&#8217; is so minimalist that it basically goes absolutely nowhere.  The first half just hangs there pointlessly, doing nothing to really propel or even build a real story.  When the murder happens, it all feels so unimportant, and the way that the film just keeps moving forward only cements that.  But then, when the body is found and it feels like maybe something is going to pick up, the film doesn&#8217;t feel even remotely concerned with making it all work.  I just didn&#8217;t go anywhere for me.  It just meandered meaninglessly and felt so hollow.The direction felt so lazy, but maybe that is the wrong word.  Underdeveloped?  Unformulated?I guess maybe if the suspense that so many have noted were there, I would have reacted better to this film, but I never felt remotely moved (in any way) by any of this (outside of Henri).  Everything just seemed to hang there lifelessly.  So many have noted suspense building in the moment when Franck follows Michel into the lake, but I felt nothing.

1500114,"I'm not sure why IMDb voters only rate FOX's THE THREE STOOGES (2012) at 5.1.Of utmost importance is that the picture's two plots are irrelevant to the main event: three actors who through skillful slapstick (and spot-on sound effects) bring back to life our old favorites, Moe, Larry and Curly. My only complaint, and it's a small one, is this modern Larry Fine doesn't get the funniest lines as the original did (""Look! An inkwell!"").It's incredible how skilled these guys are and how much they resemble the Stooges. Their synchronicity in timing slaps, eyepokes and shovels to the sconce is impeccable and when they get going all out they're as funny as Moe Howard, Larry Fine and Curly Howard ever were. It's a movie that's perfect for home viewing, BTW. I laughed throughout!My favorite sight gag (of about 50) is the boys accidentally unloosing a large brass bell from its tower. The bell slides down an inclined roof and hits on the top of the dome the nosy nun (played by Larry David in drag) that's been hounding our knuckleheads since the film's beginning. Naturally, there's a loud BONG! when it happens. The Stooges peer over the roof's edge and see the unconscious nun spreadeagled on the lawn. A classic ""Nyaaah!"" reaction shot.Moe says, ""Uh-oh, is that Sister Mary-Mengele?"" and Curly shoots back in his inimitable falsetto, ""I dunno, but the face rings a bell!""You've gotta love stuff like that.This Farrelly brothers farce is divided into three ""shorts"" but it's all one story. Each opens with recreations of one of the several beloved ""Stooge"" themes. Before we reach the finale (then the Farrellys warning little kids not to hit anyone with a hammer or poke an eye), we see a peeing newborn fight in a maternity ward, the boys plummeting from a multi-storey building, a little girl suspended in air by party balloons who lands butt-first in a gorgeous cake, also the usual crab latched onto a nose, Curly destroying a chainsaw's teeth with his iron forehead, Moe ripping out Larry's hair, Curly running in a circle while laying on his side and all the other zaniness we expect from these chowderheads.But there's a bonus for all fans (and haters) of a certain reality TV show set on the coast of a herein unnamed Mid-Atlantic State (don't miss this part-- it's hilarious!).If you're in the mood for some real ""nyuks,"" rent or buy THE THREE STOOGES - The Movie.

1596613,"This semi-art house, semi-perverse film is only for lovers of true indie horror.  That said, this was well-done considering its shoestring budget.After suffering some serious heart complications, fantasy erotica artist David (Bath Salt Zombies, Easter Casket) strikes a deal with the Devil for a new heart.  He didn't turn to Medicaid or venture to Canada for cheaper solutions&#8230;nope.  The Devil had just what he needed.  And with that David's heart is replaced by a tentacle monster in a wooden chest.  Just one problem:  the monster needs to be fed living flesh in order to survive.  The monstrous heart is eloquently voiced by an Bill Nighy sound-alike.Writer/director Dustin Mills (Bath Salt Zombies) clearly made an effort with this script.  His writing is far from brilliant, but he definitely deserves credit for delivering far more than I've come to expect from the vast majority of direct-to-DVD horror.  Theatrical devices like overt melodrama, narration and asides add an irregular flavor to this film.  Whereas this flavor may please the art house crowd, some may find it over-the-top and distasteful.Speaking of distasteful&#8230;  Is there a lot of sexuality and perversion?  Yes.  But I see it as being used more as an exploitative &#34;device&#34; than purely as a crutch to cover the film's shortcomings.  There's masturbation, which seems to reveal our protagonist's desperation, and nudity, which does not utilize the typical stripper-cast actresses. There are also several sex scenes with little to no nudity.Some of the acting in this is real crap (sorry, but I'm referring especially to Dustin Mills' cameo) and the effects are about as cheap as they come.  But considering this film had a budget of about $1500, I think I'll let it slide.  If you can make anything that entertains me for that cheap, then you've succeeded as a filmmaker.  The closing action sequence is awful and fun.I should note that whereas this film is not nearly as deep or art house-ish as Lo (2009), the style is similar enough to warrant comparison.  Those who love true indie horror will likely enjoy this film.  But just because you consider yourself an adventurous horror-goer, that doesn't mean this is for you.",Night Of The Tentacles

Here, Stallone plays a cop who, after having been confined in a cryogenic prison, wakes up in the future and must face his old nemesis, career criminal Simon Phoenix, played by Wesley Snipes, who is also once again awake and doing what he likes best...causing chaos and leaving dead bodies in his wake.  Aided by future cop Lieutenant Lenina Huxley, played by Sandra Bullock, Stallone navigates this new futuristic society, trying to adapt and also retain the skills he needs to take the madman Phoenix down once and for all.  So, this is an action movie, with over-the-top stunts, clich&eacute; moments, and corny lines.  But you just can't help but enjoy it.  The lines, especially those in the future, are pretty funny and the tough-guy lines are pretty cool.  ""You'll regret it for the rest of your life...both seconds of it"" is my favorite.  I do wonder what the MPAA thought as they were trying to decide the rating for this film...what with no actual sex happening and profanity being highly discouraged.

Some of the special effects (Classic 80's SFX) are so laughable you wonder why they didn't try again and maybe get it right the next time around.  The plot (Such as it is) is as transparent as a high quality pane of glass.  Yet, for all its flaws, I love it!While the acting won't ever be considered for an Oscar, at least they try.  The Mandroid, a rebuilt human named John, wants to stop his evil creator from completing his scheme for world domination.  I won't say what the evil doctor has planned, but it is an interesting twist on plots to rule the world.  Some of this evil genius' methods of handling his &#34;goon squad&#34; are rather unique, picturesque, and downright hilarious.Whoever it was who dreamed up this plot sure had a lot of incongruities thrown in.  Ever seen a speedboat get torpedoed on a river in Guatemala?  Didn't think so, but that's what happens in this flick.As I said, this flick is so bad it's actually worthwhile seeing.  I gave it five stars for pure Chutzpah!  Do I recommend it?  Well, yes, I do, because it's good for laughs and boo-boo spotters.  Too bad it's not on DVD.  Still, it's worth a bowl of popcorn and a tall, cold soda on a boring afternoon.  I'll be honest with you: I even went so far as to buy a new VCR/DVD player because my old one died after playing this once.

King Dinosaur is ripe for insult with its abysmal settings and special effects, but who can't feel something for the lovable Joey the Lemur?

I don't think I've heard any Blu-ray music as perfectly engineered as this one. You can literally hear EACH and every one of the 3 guitarists, the bass, Dizzy's keyboards, and the booming drums. And then there's Axl. It seems as the years go by he has finally realized his gift of his singing abilities, and now he has really honed it and treated it right. No more sounding coarse and wear and tear as the concert goes on. His last song is just as powerful as his first. His vocal range is truly amazing, and now he knows how to treat it right so that it continues to sound amazing throughout. I was really surprised and pleasantly shocked how much better he sounds now than when he was in his 20s - it is truly quite astonishing.The set list is awesome. Each and every of those songs deserves to be there, even the newer material. You can debate a few are missing, such as ""My Michelle, Double Talkin' Jive, Don't Damn Me, Bad Apples"" etc. also deserved to be on there, but hey, you can't complain much when there are 25 songs - many other concerts have half as much.This is definitely a collector's item of GnR fans, and for those who want to introduce new fans to GnR. There is very little adult language, and besides pole dancers and dancers in lingerie, the content is family-safe.I am so happy I was able to get this concert, that I just purchased a second copy to save for the future.

This is one the best examples of 80s camp around.  Barry Bostwick in skin tight gold lame, gold headband with blond locks flowing, riding around on a souped up motorcycle and grinning beyond belief.  Because it was made in the 80s there is no CG just very obvious photoshop and bad set designs.  The plot line is some unknown middle eastern (I assume) army being harrassed by a gloriously bad mercenary and they reach out to our heros for help.  Our heros are members of an elite, unknown special forces with all the good toys band of soldiers.  They even have their own James Bond type Q.

He orders Uno macho grande tequila bottle, he tilts his head back and boom. Just like that he became a human funnel. His bladder close to bursting, he asks where the crapper is. New friends join him in the crapper for a game of patty cake.His new friends got mad when David kept beating them. He puts his new buddy threw the door.

1659478,"KILL YOUR DARLINGS seemed like the film for me out of all the slop I've seen released thus far in 2014. Imagine, an old Beatnik like me, acquaintance of Allen Ginsberg, huge fan of Daniel Radcliffe--and here's a biopic about Ginsberg, played by Radcliffe. DREAMLAND! ... I was right and wrong ....Well, to be blunt and sweet: the film hits all the right notes as an artistic/period production. There is something missing--Capotewas suffused with it (see my review), this wasn't--but what there is leaps out pleasantly. Set at the time when a young Ginsberg was just off to Columbia, the remainder of this is not so impressive. It is, to be perfectly frank, a huge bore except for the stunning performances.Radcliffe is growing as an artist, and I would expect to see him in something like this at this stage of his career. The problem is, this film should have been about theHowl and Other Poems (City Lights Pocket Poets, No. 4)trial, and about far more important things than it presents. Many will disagree with me: a reviewer must press on. This film is trivial, a showcase for some pretty faces (plus a woefully miscast Jack Kerouac).The story here, that of Lucien Carr's commission of murder, is one I know vaguely and did not want to know about any further. Hence the idea I always had that any film about Ginsberg would concentrate first onHowl, and Other Poems, then on the characters. This film is a yes-no proposition for me and I will be even more honest: I refused to watch any more of it after about 90 minutes or a bit less. I'd had enough, even Radcliffe's presence being unable to sustain me any longer.Get it if you must; there is no other film quite like it and as I said, it has value. Perhaps I am missing something and it is a great film ... but it will never be a classic, nor do I think it will even be remembered except as another Radcliffe jumping-off point.",N/A

In Angels & Demons he's asked by the Vatican police to help solve a mystery.  He is the prime mover in this film running against the clock to keep kidnapped priests from being murdered after the death of a Pope.  It is fast paced and slickly done.

It has been a while since I've read the books, so I cannot say for sure where things deviated, but nothing really stuck out to me (unlike other book-to-movies where obvious plots/information is missing/changed). The directorial style of F. Lawrence very closely resembled that of G. Roth in the first movie. Sometimes going between directors in trilogies is so noticeable that it seems like a completely different cast/crew/plot style/etc. This loses the flow between movies and it comes off as a disconnected plot. This was not the case for Catching Fire.There is not much to say about the cast that has not already been said and noted.

But Oscar-winner Sarandon may actually be more of a liability than an asset here; I mean, what's she doing in this barely impressionable, lightweight, sporadically entertaining movie?  In other words, her presence as an Oscar winner actually makes you more aware of the movie's flaws.  It actually reminds me of a ""My Name is Earl"" episode, just stretched into a movie, whether or not the script was complete, or so it seems.  It finally has some substance, though, in about the last 30 minutes (which, I guess,  may mean it's actually one-third baked, LOL), so that's a plus.  The final scene, going for a serious moment (involving the blinds, which is unintentionally funny), kind of sums the movie up:  It doesn't quite feel genuine.

Greta acting by Ranulph Fiennes who has clearly put his scandalous sexual romp in the Quantas jet 30,000ft ASL with a blond Quantas flight stewardess far behind him. Wonderful acting and great chemistry amongst the actors especially between the Concierge and his protege Zero, the lowly Lobby Boy who ends up owning the hotel! Great action sequences too and a very comic shoot out where all the people are such bad shots! It all starts with the villain pulling out his walther PPK 7.65mm pistol form an ankle holster...Numerous shots fired but no one hits anything! The Remarkable Courtesan au Chocolat 3 tier cake is so scrumptious it is to kill for...much like the priceless painting &#34;Boy with apple&#34;. The only thing I did not like was the unnecessary bad language and four letter words. I personally think that the Concierge Gustav H. would never swear, curse and use four letter words. It is simply not in his character. Daniel Dafoe's character as the evil hit-man/henchman with perpetual knuckle dusters on both hands is charmingly camp and deadly in a cheesey way. A memeorable story of intrigue, murder, treachery, greed, lust, debauchery and very nice cakes from Mendl's in Lutz...hand made by the fair Agatha.

1675242,"I loved this film. It takes the classic tale by Hans Christian Anderson and updates it with state-of-the-art 3D animation that truly is magnificent. The ice castle created by Elsa, aka The Snow Queen, is an elaborate form of imagery that exudes elegance. The tale takes a creative leap from the original but still centers on the struggle between good and evil and, in the end, we learn how love overcomes the most dire circumstances. There are some scenes which may be too frightening to your younger viewers such as the giant snow monster the Queen creates to guard her castle. But, for the most part, this is a tale to be shared with your younger children and even pre-teens will enjoy it - particularly the imagery.Youth comments: I expected the movie to be kind of like &#34;Tangled&#34; with a main plot and a long, long quest. Well... I was almost right. &#34;Frozen&#34; is a great movie the whole family should see! The movie has so much to love - comedy, romance, adventure, suspense, thrillers, fantasy and so, so much more. It also teaches us a valuable lesson of not being afraid to show who we are and put our &#34;powers&#34; to a good use.The fun starts when two young royal sisters get into an accident. One has a magical power to summon ice. The magical girl hits her little sister, Anna. She lives but, has no memory of the magic and does not see her sister for many years. When Anna finally gets to see her sister, it turns into a tragedy.The animation is so adorable and fitting for the actors. They play the voices very well. The two sisters, Anna (Kristen Bell) and Elsa (Idina Menzel) sound so much alike. The other actors, like Josh Gad do fantastic as well. The film flows very nicely too. The graphics and animation look unbelievably real.My favorite scene is when Elsa (the one with powers) runs away and builds her own ice castle. She is also my favorite character because she tries to protect her sister, but keeps messing up at it. The castle is built very nicely and it shows her true powers of being the &#34;Snow Queen.&#34; I wouldn't mind living in a castle like that myself, if you know what I mean.

Disney did a great job with the horse actors chosen to represent him: it looks like Big Red again! Ron Turcotte, Secretariat's jockey & true believer, is well represented in this film: it was Turcotte as much as Secretariat that made that Triple Crown, brilliant athletes both. Secretariat, Turcotte & groom Eddie Sweat are well & honestly represented in this film, there is truth to their stories.The human storyline of Penny Tweedy & Lucien Laurin is an engaging fiction. Diane Lane does a great job playing a Penny Tweedy who might have existed in a parallel universe: the 'little housewife' fighting against the big ol' boys club of thoroughbred racing. The Penny of the movie who researches her bloodlines & believes in her red horse is a terrific story & one I enjoy with each watching although it is an utter fiction, as is the 'retired' Lucien Laurin, well-played by John Malkovich. Even though I well remember Secretariat, and his Meadows Stables predecessor in the Derby, Riva Ridge, and have read everything available, I still enjoy the lovely little make-believe of this movie.Of course, the Belmont Stakes of 1973 was no make-believe: it was the most incredible horse race anyone has ever seen. The movie does it justice (you can also see it for yourself on youtube, in terrible '70s TV coverage!). And if you want the real story, by all means read William Nack's 'Secretariat' - it's the truth, and it's much, much better than any movie could ever be.

Why did they change the plot to this predictable piece of crap? This movie is a pile of s***. That's the truth. I wish i could have said it was excellent, like the book.

1175628,"Pathology (Marc Scholermann, 2008)It is not entirely correct to say that Pathology is an uncredited remake of Stefan Ruzowitzky's much-superior 2000 film Anatomie. There are enough differences between the two to keep the copyright lawyers at bay. But I will say that there was a time when I was watching Pathology where the two movies are so similar that I paused the movie, pulled up my spreadsheet, and searched it to see if I'd seen the movie before and just forgotten about it. I hadn't, except for when it was called Anatomie. Now, I don't want you to take that to mean that Pathology is a bad movie; it's a capable little thriller, albeit one that goes for the cheap thrill too often. Just the kind of turn-your-brain-off-and-enjoy movie that hits the spot now and again.Plot: Ted Grey (Stay Alive's Milo Ventimiglia) is a new med school student specializing in forensic pathology. While he may have gotten into his prestigious school thanks to his fiancee Gwen (Buying the Cow's Alyssa Milano)'s father being a higher-up muckety-muck there, he's no slouch when it comes to figuring out cause of death. He's good enough at it, in fact, that he catches the eye of Jake Gallo (State of Play's Michael Weston), a resident with a terrifying drug habit. But that's not Jake's only dark secret; he's also the unofficial head of a small cadre of fellow residents whose extracurricular activities include wild partying and murdering people in inventive ways to see if they can fool the other members of the group vis-a-vis cause of death. Despite his misgivings, the puzzles fascinate Ted, and soon he is drawn into the group.There's nothing here you won't see coming a mile away. But then, when pretty much everyone in your movie is a killer, it's tough to get away with making your bad guys not seem bad. It's fun. I thought it would have been just as fun without the drug-fueled orgies; your mileage may vary. But if you're looking for a serviceable thriller and some amusing causes of death, this one will be right up your alley. ** ",N/A

1340752,"Kiddish best describes this movie with its thread line that adults are stupid, self absorbed, warring fools and kids are somehow bright, intelligent, and well reasoned is designed and purposed for information warfare against unsuspecting minds. The Willie Wonka styles worn by adults are distracting and annoying at best.  The battle ground is managed remotely through technology by game planners in order to direct the game in interesting ways for the adult audience. Who ever dreamed up this nonsense should be psychologically evaluated and committed. The message that war is an innate trait in humans and in order to avoid wars in the natural world, the innate need can be fulfilled through entertainment is nonsense.  The twist of denying the audience of their need through mutually assured destruction (M.A.D.) is utterly looney. The fact, that an inexperienced kid comes up with this novel solution is beyond fantasy and that adults twist it again into M.A.D. for love is even more nutty. The stylistic approach of the movie impresses me as being of Asian origins and minds. Romeo and Juliet was more entertaining. At least, in that movie Juliet's boobs can be seen. The movie is out-of-touch with the true human condition and conveys no redeeming message.",N/A

1695885,"I was pleasantly surprised from this film. I actually enjoyed the film the whole way through from beginning to end.  There's no lack of action, drama, suspense, plot, and of course good ole pg-13 family fun and cia adventure.It's a solid 4 star movie at the very least and I gave it 5 stars because I enjoyed it and found nothing wrong with it. Many films are terrific but are brought down by little things that may annoy general audiences and I feel this film was very smooth from start to finish. I loved the characters, plot and clever writing. It had some wonderful twists, amusing and comical scenes that give you an uplifting feeling leaving you smiling.I also will not give a film 4-5 stars if most of the film is good but the ending is a letdown. This film doesn't let me down at all. Kevin Costner gives a solid performance in this action packed cia film. *spoilers* Killing is 2nd nature to him but wants to retire and focus on family after receiving some bad news. I was not only thoroughly entertained but I love films where you feel like you are actually there and can throw yourself into it like a great book. This film is recommended and also definitely worth it if you pay for it to rent or buy. I'd actually watch it again! Ha ha ""vodka and his gun."" Not sure if anyone else picked up on it but if he just would have carried around a flask with some vodka and maybe a gun he would have had no problems at all. Just take a drink when he has dizziness. And also wouldn't have to reach for his ankle gun if he was packing some hardware or 2. I just thought it was funny everytime he went to kill someone important he had dizziness lol. I was yelling buy a flask and put some liquor in it the whole time lol. Anyway in conclusion totally satisfied and pleasantly surprised! A must see for 4 star movies and up.

785406,"One of the first Godzilla movies I had watched (fourth, to be exact) was Godzilla: 2000, back when I only knew of the Showa and Heisei Godzilla series.  After renting Godzilla: 2000 on DVD, there was a trailer for the numerous Millennium series movies that were currently available.  I flipped out!  More Godzilla movies for me to watch?  It was a dream come true!There are only six movies from the Millennium series to watch, and they're all pretty great.  However, GMK: Giant Monsters All-Out Attack is definitely one of the best out of all the Godzilla movies.  It's one of the few &#34;seriously&#34; toned Godzilla flicks in the entire series.  The story is fun and keeps you interested, especially since the monster origins are re-written for this film.  It was pretty neat seeing Ghidorah portrayed as the good guy instead of the all-time baddy.  On top of the new monster backgrounds, their designs are updated as well, and they actually look kind of awesome.  Mothra has a decent update, Baragon looks great, and Ghidorah's new design looks goofy at times but still satisfying.Godzilla looks pretty damn mean, but I think they could have done a little better with his design.  They really attempted to give him his classic 1954 look, but I'm not sure if it worked out too well.  Overall, he's got a pretty good update - different, but still good.One of the best Millennium series flicks, and probably one of the best out of the whole series.  Totally worth the buy, especially if you're collecting.",N/A

1460159,"Boy Wonder (Michael Morrissey, 2010)Imagine that, as a child, you saw your mother murdered. Imagine that the police have come up with nothing in the twelve years between then and now, no matter how much you stick around. (One character in the movie says that lead character Sean Donovan has become the precinct's unofficial mascot). Imagine you think you could do better. What would you do?Variations on the theme have populated any number of recent movies, from various attempts at the Batman franchise to Super to Kick-Ass. The best of the bunch, though, you may not have heard of: Boy Wonder, a low-key thriller that came right out of left field. First time writer/director Michael Morrissey got his start in Hollywood as a producer of reality TV shows, mostly centered around home renovation (First Time Flippers, Ten Grand in Your Hand, etc.). As of this writing, Boy Wonder is his only fictional effort. I know reality TV probably pays the bills better, but for my money, Morrissey needs to ditch the networks and start doing this stuff full-time, because his debut movie knocks one out of the park.This is normally where I would put the plot summary, but I kind of did that in the first paragraph. I'm sure you concluded from what I wrote up there that Sean Donovan (TV character actor Caleb Steinmeyer in his first feature appearance, and as of this writing, last&#8212;he seems to have gone behind the camera as a production assistant) turns to vigilantism both as an outlet for his pent-up rage and as a way of tracking down his mother's killer. Thus, Sean is playing both sides of the field&#8212;enlisting the help of the police department by day while evading them at night.When it comes right down to it, there's not a great deal of plot to this, but that helps the movie stay on track, and it also leaves ample room for Morrissey to develop his characters. That's what takes the movie from standard revenge thriller into the stratosphere. Ironically, it's also most likely why the movie went nowhere upon its initial release. This is not a movie where stuff blows up; it is more interested in the mentality of its protagonist than it is his deeds (though don't get me wrong, there's enough of that to keep you jumping now and again). You probably missed this one the first time around, as almost everyone did. But if you like intelligent, well-paced, slow thrillers, catch this at your earliest opportunity. ****",Boy Wonder

My favorite moments are when Martin Short freaks out in the airport and later in the car...thus Martin Short is also my favorite actor in this film, the star, Tim Allen, coming in second.  While some of the culture clashes are clich&eacute;, some are humorous.  As for the jokes, some are admittedly crude, disgusting, and even disturbing, so keep younger kids away from the screen.  Other jokes are funny, like everything Martin Short does and the scene with the sleeping cat...and the reading of the cereal box.  Overall, a good film with some laughs.

All parties battle it out in pretty messy stile (lots of guts and green slime), and about all I could figure out is that Gabriel gets demoted to human status, Satan goes back to Hell, and Constantine is not able to stop his chain smoking.

By embracing and exploring one of the most profound bonds in nature (mother/child), the filmmakers did far more than make the &#34;evil spirit&#34; in this movie a one-dimensional lunatic - she is sympathetic and even admirable in her strive to protect &#34;her&#34; children; and Jessica Chastain's character, who is thrust, ready-or-not-here-we-go (which is pretty much like actual motherhood), into the role of surrogate mom, finds her own nurturing center through all the craziness erupting around her.

Most of them had no moral compass, no sense of empathy. I feel sorry for them now! I wish all the kids in this film the best and hope they all are able to move on to a promising future like I have. Being bullied is like a version of emotional battery. Shame on all the teachers who tell students to ignore their bullies ! I understand  that teachers are not therapists, but they should have some common sense. The teachers in this movie are freaking stupid as hell! I wanted to throw a glass through my television when the teacher gave the  victim trouble for just repeating what his bully was doing and saying to him. I can't believe how moronic these teachers are! Anyways being bullied sucks, but it gives you an edge over those who had it easy! It's true that the best revenge is living well and from what I see on Facebook  the jerks are getting back what they deserve. They either are alcoholics  who are working on their second divorces or have given their life to religion to forget what horrible beings they really are.Also the parents in this film care about their kids and that is one good thing going for the victims. My parents were useless. They blamed the  bullying  I got on me saying that I was probably rolling my eyes too much or that kids are just having fun and that it is no big deal. Suffice to say I don't speak to my ""never should have been parents"" parents anymore. I blame them more than anyone else. They did nothing and instead laughed it off. Now they are miserable and in agony, because I won't answer their phone calls. Like I said before...people get what they deserve!

But really, this is a silly story! Not that &#34;The Dungeonmaster&#34; is much better, because it's very dark and disturbing and very late 80's. It does have the nudity that so many guys are commenting about here, but to me that didn't make it worth the purchase alone, geez! &#34;Contamination .7&#34; is the most interesting film conceptually, but it too is pretty much inept. Lastly, there is &#34;The Catacombs,&#34; a weird film that features some bizarre imagery set in the underground world of a monastery. It's not any more ridiculous than any other title here, but it's filled with cheap shocks and no heart--and I can't forgive it!Overall, I love the Scream/SHOUT DVDs, and I missed these weird titles back when the VHS tapes first emerged from the gates of Hell.

1671262,"Man Of Tai Chi is a superior criminal underworld/undergroud fighting club action movie that also has some unusual undercurrents going on.  Tiger Chen plays the sole student of the last master of a highly potent form of martial arts Tai Chi, who is lured by a businessman/ultra-elite underground fight tournament owner Keanu Reaves (who also directed) into a path of increasingly dangerous contests and increasing personal darkness  Reaves's character's legitimate business is security, and so he has tie-ins to all kinds of personal, corporate and government-owned surveillance cameras, security systems, electric eyes, etc.; they even have devices planted in the televisions, etc. of persons thet're interested in, such as Chen, and their family members.  All this gives the organization a really sinister, 'omnipresent' feel, which helps lead in to a running undercurrent I'll get to in a minute.The action is outstanding, even by the high norms of Asian action movies, and the production is sleek and visually powerful.  There are good subplots involving the growing estrangement between Chen and his mentor, and involving the Chinese police's efforts to crack the organization, who they know of in detail but can prove nothing, and can't move against with so many powerful, big-money people involved.It's in the organization and in Reaves's character that we find possibly the most intriguing subplot.  Aside from it being obvious that it has far more money and resources than you'd expect from your average mob-run fight club, the true motivations beyond what they're doing seem to go deeper than just the fights, and deeper than the explanation given before one of the big events about three quarters of the way in.  Buried between the lines are, to my interpretation, clues that the organization's hierarchy is looking for a lot more than just the next big draw to their shows, and also (I hope I'm not giving anything away, but this seemed evident to me from early on) that there seems to be a strange, even inhuman aspect to Reaves and at least one of his higher henchmen.  It's a fascinating angle with lots of possibilities, but even without it this is a first-rate, dramatic modern-day Chinese martial arts movie, deserving of a far bigger audience than what it seems to have gotten so far, and surpassing my expectations.",N/A

1613959,"Double-features don't come any better than this one. Casablanca is on almost every list of the ten best movies ever made, often at #1. The African Queen was Bogart's only Academy Award winning performance, and was unavailable on DVD or Blu-ray until 2010. Both make the Internet Movie Database's list of the top 250 movies of all time.Casablanca was a 1942 production about life in North Africa at the time of the expected German occupation, not a lot different from many other films of the time, but the stellar cast (Humphrey Bogart, Ingrid Bergman, Paul Henreid, Claude Rains, Sydney Greenstreet and Peter Lorre) and a topical script caught the wartime mood of the public and became a classic, its strength growing rather than diminishing through the many years since. It has two famous lines which have entered the language: ""Play it again, Sam"", which exact line was never spoken in the film; and ""I'm shocked, shocked, that gambling is going on in this establishment"", spoken by a police Colonel (Claude Rains) as he is pocketing his night's winnings at Rick's Caf&eacute;. ""I'm shocked, shocked"" is used today as a sarcastic prefix to some outrage that the speaker finds not in the least surprising. This edition of Casablanca is loaded with extras, including commentaries by film critic Roger Ebert and film historian Rudy Behlmer, a documentary on Bogart with Lauren Bacall, a documentary on the making of Casablanca, a remembrance from Bergman's daughter Pia Lindstrom and Bogart's son Stephen, a Bug's Bunny spoof ""Carrotblanca"", both a television and a radio adaptation of Casablanca, and theatrical trailers.The African Queen (1951) was a World War I story from what was then German East Africa (Tanzania today). Directed by John Huston, it stars Humphrey Bogart as the captain of the small open steamboat grandly called The African Queen, and Katherine Hepburn as the spinster sister of a forlorn Anglican missionary (Robert Morley). The story is focused almost entirely on the two stars, and being the consummate professionals they were, they carry it off very well. The nature of the on-location African shoot can be surmised from the subtitle of the book that Hepburn wrote afterwards, ""The Making of the African Queen, or How I Went to Africa with Bogart, Bacall and Huston and Nearly Lost My Mind"". There is only one extra with The African Queen, but it is a doozy: the hour-long ""Embracing Chaos -- Making The African Queen"".This is a real value for two of the greatest films from Hollywood's golden era.",N/A

1695511,"Wow. I had never heard of this film, randomly came across it, and decided to give it a chance based on some positive reviews. This is one of the best science fiction films that I have seen lately. The premise mines the endlessly fascinating subject of artificial intelligence, and does so with nuance, even considering the fairly quick pace of the story. Very tight construction overall.The main thing that I would say is that The Machine is exceptionally well directed. It is a work of both technical skill and artistic instinct. This is not the sort of cheap sci-fi that you may be wondering if it is, if you are anything like me. It may not be a huge, behemoth of a film, but it incorporates some very cool, perfectly utilized visual effects, and the shot composition is fantastic. Perfect visual choices for the material. The writing and acting are solid, and in the case of the lead actress of course, notably good.There are certainly traces of Blade Runner, A.I., Her and other films, but this one stands on its own just fine. It is serious, thoughtful science fiction. Not perfect, but critiquing the occasional scientific implausibility is really missing the point, here. This is not a documentary, but rather a fictional drama. That being said, it is in my opinion and impeccably well-made film and one of the best examples of recent film-making in this genre. If you think that you even might be interested, then you should absolutely check it out.",N/A

There wasn't a lot of interaction between her and the store employees, that is true, like the female lead in Miracle on 34th Street.  I think I would have preferred the sequel to after they were married and her world broadened and they went through the war together, how their marriage would have lasted.  Now that would be a movie.

1291365,"Set in a future where a nuclear war has decimated the population and left mutants, barbarism, and an uneven survival of technology, Genesis II was a pilot concept that opened up a lot of room for weekly adventures. Unfortunately, this pilot was not picked up, even thought it generated enough interest to be tried twice more! So we have a limited stock of the adventures of Dylan Hunt ... a scientist of the past living in an uneven world of tomorrow.One of the reasons that we remember this so well so long after its initial broadcast has to be the beautiful Mariette Hartley. Roddenberry had fought the censors over his costumes for the ladies on Star Trek, with one of the proscriptions being that he could not show their navels! By the time he made Genesis II the standards had relaxed, and he sought his revenge by showing Mariette Hartley with not one, but TWO belly buttons. LOL She looked great with any number of belly buttons, and Roddenberry successfully cultivated the teen fantasies that Genesis II was designed to tap into.Alex Cord looked great in the role and carried the right amount of ""Kirk-like"" stubbornness, although his acting was a bit stiff in places. His voiceovers sounded a bit more like the tough guy than the thoughtful scientist, but he worked in the role anyway. The network execs may have had the same quibbles I did, as he was replaced in the two follow-up pilots by John Saxon.The societies depicted here are not very subtle. It is the struggle of Pax (peace) versus Tyrania (tyranny). Hunt, who was discovered trapped in a suspended animation experiment gone wrong, is pulled back and forth between the two, each hoping that his expertise can help their side, or at the least not aid the other.Sets and costuming here were minimal, with the most effort probably going into the set depicting an underground tube station of the future. Still, it was an enjoyable show and worth a look. I'd recommend trying this out on the low priced rental before paying the big bucks for the DVD.For those of us who saw this air in the 70s, it is worth a look for old times sake. Later generations of viewers may not regard it as fondly.",N/A

At least two someones, actually, since the Third Reich, was confiscating everything they could lay hands on. Whether it was a heartfelt attempt at saving the artifacts of culture or just another, possibly petty way to thwart Hitler's ambitions hardly matters. The team of art historians felt it was worth their lives to reclaim the stolen works, and to save them from the &#34;If I go I'm taking them with me&#34; megalomaniac.You might think that WWII movies had already mined the lode of everything dramatically interesting.

Despite the star-studded cast, the nerds-first premise, and so much about the war and the art itself, I had trouble connecting with the drama and the characters.

I much prefer no circus, leaving El Gallo's persona to the imagination, rather than having him be some literal creature of human form.  I see him as nature overlooking the callow, helping to mature natural naivete.  And who on earth cast the actor in the role of El Gallo?  He is weak vocally and not nearly handsome enough to attract Luisa.  He might just as well have been Matt as El Gallo.  Joel Grey, who is given top billing, likely because of the fame he garnered after his brilliant portrayal of the MC in &#34;Cabaret,&#34; provides a lackluster, very disappointing portrayal of the girl's father.  The rest of the cast is more than satisfactory, in particular, &#34;the girl.&#34;  Songs are deleted too.  Fortunately, they can be viewed in the specials after the movie finishes.

1366176,"I have purchased many exercise tapes and DVD's over the years, including one or two Yoga presentations.  At last I have found one that works and doesn't drive me nuts with a 20-something yelling for half an hour.  No, the instructor has a very soothing voice, the other two people working with her are totally silent throughout the tape, and there is NO music!  Thank God!  The first day, I was quite frustrated trying to do as she directed and did not finish the work-out.  The second day, I got most of it down due to better concentration, and the third day (today) I got almost all of it by really listening to &#34;right/left&#34; commands.I bought this DVD because I've had a rotten ski season due to pain in my left hip/lower back area.  I move my furniture around a lot, so probably twisted the wrong way at some point.  One day last week, I went skiing even though I was hurting, got up there and found I could not take more than one run because I was in such pain, even having taken an Aleve that morning.  I stretched when I got home, used and ice pack on the hip, and took Aleve again, all to no avail, and I was miserable in bed.  I've been in pain until yesterday when I did most of the Yoga routine on this dvd and was totally amazed and shocked that my pain went away, and I woke up this morning feeling normal.  In fact, I felt good enough to ski, but did not because I wasn't organized enough to go.Well, I did this routine again tonight, and really feel good.  One other reviewer said they felt great after they did the tape only once, and, really, I thought &#34;this can't be&#34;, but I found out it really does work if you apply the instructor's directions and are serious about finishing the whole workout.  I now wish I had started Yoga 40 years ago.  I am almost 68, but have always been in good shape for the most part.  I do not like exercise in general, like what you get at gyms (I belong to 3), and I hardly use my 2 pieces of exercise equipment because it is too boring.  But this workout is fabulous.  It is easy and difficult at the same time; there is no sweating or pounding, but somehow it works.  I thought my ski season was over, but now I plan to go at the first opportunity when we get more new snow.  I also plan to look into other dvd's by this wonderful instructor who I found on PBS.  I am so thankful I was able to fix my problem with this yoga workout instead of going to a doctor, followed by more boring therapy.  Try it; you will be amazed if you have the patience to get through the first day.  I am not very flexible, so if I can do this, so can you.",Yoga for the Rest of Us: Easy Yoga for Arthritis
711649,"This is a great series.  The cast selection was superb.  In telling the story of the main characters, the producers spared no expense.  All of the actors were put through a mini-boot camp and were instructed to remain in character for the duration of the filming.  The end result is that they are believable in every way.  They easily become US military personnel of the era.  Each of the actors adopts the persona of their real-life counterpart and become that person.  By remaining in character, they effortlessly respond to their name and convey the feeling that they are actually who they portray.  I read the book and much of the dialogue stems from the book.  One can connect to each of the main characters.  It was interesting to note that many of the actors are British, but pull off an American accent very nicely.All of the battle scenes are meticulously researched and draw the viewer in.  In particular, the scenes set during the siege of Bastogne where the men are holding the line in the Ardennes forest. They are so realistic that I could feel the cold and experience the privations the men were experiencing, although many of the scenes were shot on a sound stage.  My favorite battle scenes however, were of the D-Day landings and the attack on the German Artillery Battery at Brecourt Manor.  I was privileged to travel to Normandy a few years ago and went to Brecourt Manor and the story was retold by the current resident who is the son of the actual family who lived there at the time.  There is a small monument dedicated to the members of Easy Company who attacked the manor and destroyed the guns that were firing on Utah Beach.As I watched the series, I became more acquainted with each of the characters and was saddened each time one was killed in battle or because of some weird accident.  You cannot help but notice that each of the actual members of the 501st ""Easy Company"" were proud to have served and while it was a terrifying experience for many, to a man, they would not have missed it for anything.  They fought for each other and bonded as brothers.  I felt the loss of their comrades as conveyed by each of the actual members in their interviews for the series.  I think this series does a great honor to the men of the 101st Airborne and all of the soldiers who fought during WWII.  I have the series on DVD and much of the background of the making of the series is in the ""special features"" section of each disk.",N/A

1080393,"This version of Dracula offers an alternative version of the Bram Stoker novel to the Christopher Lee/Hammer Films genre.  Louis Jourdan, as Dracula, offers a more subdued, less menacing Dracula than that provided by Mr. Lee (I have to say that I prefer Mr. Lee's interpretation or Jack Palance's in Dan Curtis' production).  The ensemble cast is good and as with all the presentations of the Dracula novel, some of the characters presented in the book are merged into one (in this case, the Quincy Morris character has taken over Lord Holmwood's and Mina Murray has become Lucy Westenra's sister and not her best friend).  Frank Finlay stands out as Van Helsing.  The production speeds up toward the end.  It would have been a better production had it followed the novel and allotted more time to the tracking down of the Count.  In short, the BBC production is competent but not particularly inspired.  Still, its better than many of the adaptations of the Stoker novel, most of which, in my opinion, have failed to do the Stoker novel justice.",N/A

It may be a ""comic masterpiece"", but it was written for a country that not long before this opera was guillotining nuns (See Dialogues of the Carmelites).  Thus, I find it, as a work, offensive, and am not surprised it has taken so long to enter the contemporary repertoire.  Contrary to what Berlioz and others may have thought, I am convinced the pinnacle of Rossini's comic operas is the triad of  L'Italiana in Algieri, Il Turco in Italia and the Barber of Seville.

1697039,"""Godzilla"" 2014 is without question the best looking Godzilla movie ever. It smashes the 1998 Roland Emmerich ""Godzilla"" like a Toyota under the foot of the skyscraper monster. Comparing it to its Japanese predecessors that made the character iconic is sort of pointless. ""Mothra Vs. Godzilla"" is classic monster movie heaven. Godzilla's battles with Ghidorah and Destoroyah are irreplaceable in their purely enjoyable cheesiness. They are quite simply loved for that very cheesiness. ""Godzilla"" 2014 tossed the cheesiness away and went for the reality gusto. So, you either want cheese with your giant nuclear waste created lizard, or you do not.There is absolutely nothing cheesy about ""Godzilla"" 2014 unless you consider the attempts to make personal connections amid all the destruction, cheesy. Somehow those attempts sort of fell flat  despite the fact that some very capable actors were trying to make those connections. Bryan Cranston (Breaking Bad) plays Joe Brody who is a nuclear physicist who has been tracking the slowly building anomaly, unsure of what he is tracking. Aaron Taylor-Johnson plays his son, Lieutenant Ford Brody, who doesn't know what to think of his father until his fathers predictions start gaining merit. Elizabeth Olsen, the younger sister of Mary-Kate and Ashley Olsen, plays Elle Brody; Ford's wife who is trying to stay alive, find Ford and save lives while dodging falling buildings.Unfortunately, there is nothing complicated or extremely interesting about anything the humans do in this film, which makes the ""Cloverfield""-like cutaways from the true star of the film, Godzilla, a little disappointing. For that matter, Godzilla's storyline isn't all that complicated either, but many of the human elements of the film serve absolutely zero purpose other than to show off the money and effects they spent on making Godzilla look absolutely breath-taking. That, rightfully so, is the saving grace of the film. The scenes of epic destruction and people adapting to a crumbling environment are mind-blowing.To think that you're going to see ""Godzilla"" in order to be affected with dramatic stories is unrealistic, but the thing is, the creators tried. ""Godzilla"" is an old-school monster film with new-school technology and effects. Despite its problems, Godzilla entertains. The films that ""Godzilla"" was founded upon weren't anything that challenged the brain either. Once you understand that and understand that the creators at least tried to make it something more, you should enjoy what it is; a good old fashion monster slug-fest.",N/A
1158119,"The movie blatantly ties together the difficulties of being the new kid at school and being the out teen. I don't quite see why the movie had to be set in some version of Europe given the only venues that we see in this movie are limited to the school, Chance's house and the drag bar for the most part. Setting aside, this is ultimately a character-driven story and the venue doesn't really matter. The movie was also set in the 80's, which was presented in terms of some of the fashion choices and the music, but not much else.At the end of the day the story is sort of timeless or appropriate to pretty much any period since coming out was a thing.It's interesting to note that Tad Hilgenbrinck was the same guy who played Matt Stifler in American Pie Presents Band Camp - as in the try-hard player kid who was trying to imitate his brother. So from overconfident douche to determined gay teen - that's an interesting range. He wasn't necessarily amazing in the role, but he did pretty well for himself.The movie has a lot going on with the different characters and their motivations, but never really has the time to fully explore things. Yes, Chance is still the primary character that we need to follow around. And thus we really shouldn't have had too many auxiliary characters. I think the only characters that I wish we had learned more about were Chance's family. For the most part they were just background characters who acted based on stereotypes and not much else.

1680090,"This widely acclaimed, almost three hour movie about adolescent lesbian love in a high school in France is nothing special in my opinion. Tunisian born director Abdelatif Kechiche has shown some sensibility in previous movies (for instance Games of Love and Chance) but this Cannes festival winner feels quite exploitative (his previous movie, Black Venus, was also nasty, disappointing and sensationalistic). The young actresses who play the lead (Lea Seydoux and Adele Exarchopoulos), who are not porn actresses, appear in very explicit, seemingly non simulated sex scenes (including masturbation, oral sex, fingering and doing the sex position popularly known as the 69). It would be interesting to wonder if a lesbian director (instead of a male director) would have filmed this story differently, perhaps less explicitly and more subtly. Interestingly, both actresses have complained after the film was released that they felt exploited during the filming and will not work with the director again. Based on a graphic novel.",N/A
1662031,"As one of maybe three people on the planet who has never seen an episode of The X-Files, I have rarely had the opportunity to see and enjoy Gillian Anderson&#8217;s work. Not long ago, while taking the tube in London, I saw a poster for a play Ms Anderson was doing in the West End. Given her background in theatre, this was impressive. Recently I saw her outstanding performance in The Crimson Petal & The White, and was very impressed by her performance as the madame of a brothel. Made up like an old crone, she was the opposite of Hollywood glamour.Shame on me for not knowing much about one of the great actresses of our time.The only other actress imaginable as Detective Superintendent Stella Gibson, seconded from the Metropolitan Police to review a murder investigation in Belfast, Ireland, is Helen Mirren. That says a lot. Anderson is amazing in the role and the way she gradually reveals that her DS Gibson is almost as cold as the murderer she is trying to capture, is breathtaking.I&#8217;m not quite sure why the series is called THE FALL. I thought it might have something to do with the Fall from Grace, with all the inherent spirituality the subject suggests. After five episodes I still couldn&#8217;t decide why, though it hardly matters. THE FALL is an amazing achievement.The rest of the cast is perfect. Particularly ultra-handsome Jamie Dornan, who is magnificent as the serial killer, Paul Spector. In fact, there really isn&#8217;t a false note among the huge cast list. One of the comments made in the behind the scenes featurette reinforces this, remarking that a lot of well-established Irish actors were champing at the bit to be involved in this A-level production.It&#8217;s apparent by the writing, direction, acting and the cumulative impact of the entire production why the show was such a hit. A six-part second series has been commissioned, to begin filming in January, 2014. Since all of the major cast has signed to appear, this suggests that the story in series 1 isn&#8217;t over yet, a very tantalizing thought. Having said that, the recent announcement out of Hollywood that Jamie Dornan, the sex-obsessed killer in THE FALL, has been signed to star in the big screen adaptation of 50 SHADES OF GREY, may throw that idea into jeopardy. We shall have to wait and see. The hotly-anticipated 50 SHADES is a natural fit for Dornan, with its erotic blend of sex and obsession. If THE FALL was Dornan&#8217;s audition for the part of Christian Grey it couldn&#8217;t have been more convincing!There&#8217;s a lot of abuse of women on hand, but the battle of the sexes is given a fresh take the way the series develops. Anderson&#8217;s character is pretty ruthless herself and is not above taking advantage of her position in life to get what she wants. The difference between her and murderer Spector is that she lives her life within the law, though sometimes outside the circle of conventional morality. By the way, it is not a spoiler to say Dornan plays the killer as we learn that almost immediately. This is not a &#8220;who done it?&#8221; or even a &#8220;How done it?&#8221; It is more of a &#8220;Why done it and is he going to get away with it?&#8221; There are some genuine surprises and chills within that approach.There&#8217;s a lot of bad language which, once again, arguably isn&#8217;t necessary. This and some pretty rough sexual assault scenes are mentioned for those whose tastes may incline to a less graphic presentation.THE FALL is wonderful television: fresh, intriguing and as good as anything out there. Approximately half of that success is directly attributable to the brilliant Gillian Anderson, with Jamie Dornan not far behind.","THE FALL, SERIES 1"

1684027,"Beautiful, comedic, inspired, adventurous, insightful and heartfelt, these are just a few of the adjectives that well describe Ben Stiller's The Secret Life of Walter Mitty. It is honestly one of Ben Stiller's best outings as an actor and probably the best film he's ever directed. One of the most interesting aspects about this movie is simply that you do not know what to expect next.The film is very well rounded and has a general appeal to all who would watch. Many may claim that the film is boring or too slow, unfortunately for them, they just aren't watching close enough. The movie is about Life. Literally, the movie is about Life magazine and a 16 year tenured employee who has yet to do much with his. Something that you might not expect from a movie like this is the incredible cinematography (perfectly accented by the blu-ray release). There is much more to Walter Mitty than meets the eye and thats how the movie is too. The Secret Life of Walter Mitty is a very enjoyable watch and I highly recommend it.",N/A

876949,"Stanley Kubrick is a visionary director, whether or not you understood or even liked his movies you still fell in love with his style. Here we get 3 of his best films, the first being2001: A Space Odyssey, based on the novel of the same name(which was followed by 3 more novels, only one of which was also made into a film). We travel through, what I'd like to think of is noir film territory. Watching this for the first time I found myself wondering how long before the infamous HAL story would begin, but strangely wanting the glorious music to keep going. When the bulk of the main story starts you are definitely feeling like you are in another world, even as we are now way past 2001, you still feel like this future could really happen. The set keeps are the great special features that accompanies the individual release, as well as the 2 disc DVD.A Clockwork Orange, another classic that was developed based on a novel. Malcolm McDowell is amazing in this and continues to work solely on his popularity in this film. Stanley Kubrick seems to love to play out the wide lenses an angles and really knows how make even the smallest areas look huge. I also love how we are treated to a world where the old motto of &#34;Be  careful what you wish for&#34; is so blatantly realized. Again if you have the 2 Disc DVD then you have everything on this release, however if you are like me and want as much as possibly than your best bet is to get the 2 Disc Blu-Ray of this individual release(I believe its a 40th Anniversary Digibook). However this is fine for those who never seen it or are just looking to get a group of classic films in one shot.The Shining, another masterpiece based on a popular book & probably the most famous out of the three. If you want a great special edition that features loads of great extras as well as a clear and crisp picture than go no further.Overall you cannot lose by purchasing this release, you get three films for a cheap price in 3 disc.",N/A

424310,"This 1934 pre-code film had the makings of a 1930s classic: starring Al Jolson at his most energetic -- his number Vive La France, filmed live rather than synched to a sound track, gives perhaps more vividly than anything on film what he must have been like on stage -- the staff is completed by a panoply of Thirties film yeomen and yeowomen: Kay Francis, Dolores Del Rio, Ricardo Cortez, Dick Powell, and Guy Kibbee; the songs are mostly by Warren and Dubin, the production numbers by Busby Berekely. The story has something to do with Jolson's Paris caberet the Wonder Bar (""Wunderbar"" -- geddit?) as a setting for an interlocking set of frustrated lovers.And yet the whole somehow doesn't gel together. Part of the problem is that the film uneasily combines a light musical with a murder mystery, giving the effect of two movies intercut with each other. And the running stock jokes and routines, obviously recycled from the vaudeville tradition, almost give the impression of a third film, a burlesque, thrown randomly into the pot. The Berkeley production numbers, while interesting, aren't as spectacular as in his masterpieces 42nd Street or Gold Diggers of 1933, Powell looks such a callow youth that he verges on parodizing his male ingenue persona, and Del Rio's habit of expressing every emotion by looking wistfully into the distance, even if she is in a small dressing room where there is no distance to look into, gets tedious after the eighth time she does it. A high point, though, is Jolson (who was born in Lithuania when it was part of Czarist Russia) singing a soulful rendition of Ochi Tchornya (Dark Eyes) in Russian.The film's reputation for shock value -- some have suggested it was one of the reasons the Motion Picture Code was implemented shortly after -- will generally seem overstated today: there are frequent double entendres, some specific references to adultery and homesexuality, a murderess who gets away with it, and an outrageous Gaucho whip dance which seems too campy for anyone to get very upset about.The really shocking sequence today, though, as anyone who has read other reviews will know, is the extended blackface production number ""Going to Heaven on a Mule,"" which wanders through about every racial stereotype about African-Americans you can think of. I suppose it has a social value as a startling reminder of just how acceptable such racism was in America until relatively recent times.It's hard to know what rating to give this movie. As entertainment, parts of it are a lot of fun to watch, and though fairly tame by present standards, it serves as an example of what pushing the envelope was like in 1934. The 1930s women's fashions are luscious. I'd say those heavily into Thirties films, Al Jolson, Busby Berkeley, or the social history of popular cinema will find it worth watching, if they can steel themselves to sit through ""Mule."" Others probably will want to pass.I saw it on the Warner's Archive DVD, which seemed a satisfactory transfer of a not too bad print.",Wonder Bar VHS

1611940,"I guess we so-called Generation X'ers like more plot and story than just pure action, unlike our Millenial counterparts. This film seems more targeted to the action crowd than the audience who wants to see an intricate plot and a compelling storyline. While there are a few good things in this film, such as Branagh as the baddie and an interesting seduction scene between him and Keira Knightley as Jack Ryan's heartthrob, the film never quite pulled me in. At one point, the plot takes a pretty good turn where the baddie seemed to have the upper hand but that was all too brief. Thereafter, I guessed where the film was going.The plot is rather complex but underdeveloped, which is part of the problem with this latest installment in the Jack Ryan Canon. The story begins with Ryan (now played by Chris Pine, the most recent Captain Kirk in the latest Star Trek films) during his salad days as an economics PhD student at a university in London during the 9/11 attacks. After serving his country and being injured for his troubles, he is then recruited by the CIA via Thomas Harper, played by Kevin Costner. Ryan is to pretend he's a typical trader on Wall Street, but in secret he's investigating off-shore investments which might be funding terrorists group. Through an analysis that takes only minutes on-screen, Ryan discovers trillions of dollars in secret accounts which he traces to some kind of business magnate, Viktor Cherevin, played with nice understatement by Kenneth Branagh.Unfortunately, for my taste, we really don't see how Ryan was able to penetrate the accounts so fast. He just flips on his laptop and finds a whole bunch of inaccessible accounts and immediately knows what they are. I really wanted to have a much more developed sequence where he looks for clues and follows leads. After about 5 minutes of screen time, he's flying to Moscow to confront Branaugh. At the same time, he is living with the woman who was helping him in the hospital. However, she doesn't know he's secretly working for the CIA. And then Costner ends up in Moscow to help Ryan, and then lo and behold, the girlfriend ends up there too and the race is on with lots of car chases through Moscow and then in New York.Overall, a modestly entertaining but for some reason not entirely satisfying action film. At no point in the story does the baddie ever get his way or achieve any of his goals, except for one action sequence about 75% of the way into the film that is way too short. And I liked Branaugh as the vain and soft-spoken baddie, the way he should be. At a certain moment, one of the people in his organization scolds him because of his weakness for booze and broads, which was one of my two favorite scenes in the film but like most of &#34;Shadow Recruit&#34;, the good scenes were all too brief. There is also a young baddie of Russian extraction now living in America as a double-agent, but very little about him is developed except a biography which is recapped for about 30 seconds. The script needed about 2-3 more rewrites before it would have been there. Essentially about 80% action and only 20% story development. I wanted more interesting scenes, not just piles and piles of car chases. A one-watch at best.",Jack Ryan: Shadow Recruit
1681229,I love this movie because of the great sound effects everything is so loud and so realistic and the emotional rollercoaster that this man go through fixing things than being able to exhale for a brief moment and then trouble comes and then he has to fix things again and it just the redundancy of fixing and repairing and having a moment of relaxation and then having to go and fix things all over again he is constantly thinking an trying to be prepared for what may come his facial expressions the way that he cooks the way that he enjoys the rain on his skin and just everything that Robert Redford bring forth in this movie is compelling to me it really is you really don't need a whole bunch of people in a movie you really don't need a whole lot of action or profanity or sex or any of those things too have a movie that is a masterpiece and this movie prove it to the fullest extent of the work there is nothing boring in this this movie makes you think this movie makes you feel like you are on the boat with him this movie will make sure that you never go sailing all alone.  this is the Virginia jean with an SOS call over,N/A

994886,"In this stark, silent melodrama from 1929, we see the darkly compelling template for hundreds of films noir that came later. The story is simplicity itself: a young, earnest police officer who lives at home with his parents is summoned to arrest a beautiful would-be jewel thief & take her to the local police station. Needless to say, he never gets her there, being completely won over by her seductive act. Yet it becomes more than that, as she's actually drawn to the innocent young man, who is guilt-ridden but unable to let go of her. And then her criminal boyfriend reappears on the scene ...What makes this film so intense & dazzling is the cinematography, which captures the shadowed energy of the city at night -- but even more than that, it's the astonishing performance by Betty Amann as the leading lady/femme fatale. She's a vision of dark-eyed, silken slinkiness who reveals an almost feral lust in her attempts to seduce the young police officer. She not only literally throws herself at him, she throws herself ON him, clawing at his hair & grinding her body into his with stunning ferocity. Yet she also shows a remarkable tenderness in later scenes, often with almost imperceptible expressiveness. Her eyes are absolutely incredible!There are only a handful of title cards, but the acting & direction tell you everything you have to know. The score is often jaunty, even jolly, providing a mocking counterpoint to the increasingly corrupt goings-on. It's melodrama boiled down to its essence, a thick, black, sickly-sweet syrup that draws flies to the moral decay of the players. Highly recommended!",N/A

The velvety razor sharp image, sweet clean sound and detail of the ancient castle is amazing.I thought maybe the extra 14 minutes would ruin the pace of the film with pointless filler, like the restored version of &#34;Deep Red.&#34;  Not so!  It's relevant story info presented here, with many wonderful moments that explain so much and build so nicely to the &#34;big&#34; scenes.  These missing scenes really give the movie its credibility back.Extras include an interview with legendary Barbara Steele.  She is in a good mood here, so it is fun to watch.  Her recollections are fascinating.Great price for a great product.  Thank you Amazon!  :-)",Nightmare Castle
1679311,"Any film dealing with ""scams"" or ""con men"" will, by definition, be deceptive, convoluted hazy and hard to follow.  And ""American Hustle"" is no exception.  In fact, the buzz surrounding this production is overrated.  To this viewer, it's the kind of movie where you might a well sit back and simply enjoy the acting and not really worry about, ""Fully grasping what's going on and what the hell just happened"". There are some movie spoiler sites online that you can turn to for a blow by blow examination of the plot, but even these synopses seem to go on forever.",N/A

367629,"All of my many reviews focus solely upon the actual quality of the film's transfer from Standard Def DVD  to the higher standard set for Blu Ray. Summaries of the plot and opinions of the story line and acting can be found in the majority of the other reviews so I do not want to be redundant.  The film's historical accuracy has been subject to debate, but then so was the accuracy of the much superior film 'Tombstone' with Kurt Russell and Val Kilmer.Keep in mind, however, that the quality of what you see and hear is also dependent upon the quality of the TV monitor you are watching on as well as the home theater set up you are using. The monitor I use is a fairly new Panasonic ZT 65&#34; plasma and the amps, speakers, cables, BluRay player and Surround Processor I use are hi end esoteric gear to provide me with a more realistic and objective perspective.VIDEO QUALITY.....The video for the 192 minute version of Wyatt Earp on Blu Ray (this is not the extended version I have been told is available on the Standard Def DVD) is one of the more uneven Blu Rays I have ever seen in terms of imaging quality.  Most of the day time scenes have fairly decent and natural color grading and contrast and yet other day scenes display a smoothing of details and various degrees of deep blacks. Some scenes show blacks that are impressive but most of the time the blacks often take upon a grayish color grading.  Night time scenes have an unnatural, overly cool blue color grading with a significant loss of detail where there needn't be.  It is somewhat unusual to see such unevenness and lack of consistency in a Blu Ray's imaging.  I noticed no dropouts or disturbing artifacts for this disc but it was quite clear to me that there was no remastering for Blu Ray either; it was simply re-encoded to Blu Ray with an Mbps average rate in the high teens.  While the video is very watchable, its variability in blacks, details and skin tones was completely noticeable.AUDIO QUALITY....A Blu Ray DVD with a lossy Dolby Digital 5.1 audio is almost unheard of for Blu Rays.  The only other one that comes to mind is'Goodfellas' and, for both, it is criminal.  You are paying for the highest quality and not getting it.  While the lossy audio codec being used is perfectly listenable, we would have gotten much more for our home theaters systems with a lossless audio codec.  That said, the dialogue was easy to discern with volume levels quite consistent.  During the first 70 minutes of the film the front audio stage, while mostly steered through the center channel, still had some nice panning and foley fx to the right and left surrounds as well as some discreet foley fx that were nicely separated.  The rear surrounds and LFE channel were not used at all that I could hear.  Actually it almost made me jump when, finally, a foley came through the rears almost half way through the film.  During the second half of the movie there were a few more uses of the rear surrounds and a lightning storm woke up the sub channel producing good but not very deep bottom end.  The music score provided a wide stereo image across the front audio stage but, to my mind, sometimes overshadowed and stepped upon what should have been discreet foley audio fx.EXTRAS.....There were a great many deleted scenes that probably were included in the extended version.  In addition to the typical movie trailer, there was also a documentary 'Making of' that I didn't particularly find very interesting. I have read a great deal about the Earp family and the history behind the Earp legend and a historical featurette on this would have been welcome.To be honest, I am glad I only paid $7.99 for this Blu Ray as it clearly was not properly prepared for its blu ray transfer.I do hope that this review, which focused solely upon the quality of the actual transfer to Blu Ray has been of some help to you in deciding your purchase. All of my reviews are of this nature and I hope they can be of HELP to you as well.Thanks for reading.",Wyatt Earp VHS

1693154,"The whole new version of ""Godzilla"" animated is in many ways not just direct sequels to the much maligned movie, but trumps it with 40 episodes. Done in a very nice style that isn't influenced by anime. Similar to ""MIB"" series, ""Big Guy & Rusty the Boy Robot"" and ""eXtreme Ghost Busters."" A nice animation style with nice detail beats hands down any of the really cheap animation of the late 1970's to 1980's. The stories are interesting too with different types of mutations, hostile locals and even aliens and various groups, including the US military, adding to the problems that HEAT faces around the world as the rise of giant mutations continues. The action takes place all over the USA, but also the world. Just as in XGB there is a time travel story into a bleak future where HEAT sees the aftermath of a new monstrous hybrid species that seems too well adapted to stop.HumanitarianEnvironmentalActionTeamGood news! The two previous unaired episodes are part of it.Sadly there are no extras which is disappointing. However the four discs are packed tight so watch out when you open it. A little difficult prying them out. They probably found it was cheaper to stack them so be careful when you work to remove them. They are numbered so no problem there. No trailers or commercials so you don't have to wait long to get to the good stuff.  Now if they would only release those other three cartoon series I listed above and then I rest easy.For the money a very good deal. Haven't seen this cartoon since it ran in 1998.",Godzilla - The Complete Animated Series
574839,"Handsome young men whack each other in the face with sticks and learn about life in this enjoyably silly hockey movie. Rob Lowe stars as Dean Youngblood, an American rookie who's been given a shot on a Canadian Junior League hockey team. Sure, he can skate, but can he take a punch? This coming-of-age story is about learning the beauty of vicious hockey fights.No, really. Containing both young-bucks-in-the-locker-room shots and plenty of hockey violence, Youngblood is a surprisingly entertaining cupcake of a movie--there's not much nourishment, but it sure tastes good. Watch for Patrick Swayze as the team's leader and Keanu Reeves in his first film role as the French-Canadian goalie.The DVD's most entertaining feature is the option of watching Youngblood dubbed into French--not to be missed.

1654226,"BOTTOM LINE: Worth it to see an excellent performance by Lennie James but series may not be what you expect.Lennie James as Detective Chief Inspector Tony Gates may bring many viewers to Line of Duty but unfortunately he is featured less in the series than he is on the DVD cover art. Viewers spend a lot of time with the other two cast members in the image, Martin Compston and Vicky McClure, and their characters are easy to dislike. A lot.Similarly, only at the beginning and end of the series do you get to see Gates be as dynamic and clever as one would assume he would have to be to warrant so much attention from the forces focused on him. Most of the rest of the time viewers may wonder how a seasoned cop could have so little instinct about so much that so many people get to take a bite out of him. Sometimes fewer episodes along with the longer running time works out well for BBC dramas because each episode is so richly packed. This time the limit works against the series because it feels like so much of the story is missing.Line of Duty series 1 is worth picking up just for James' deep performance but it would have been more enjoyable if the character he was given to play was as good, bad, brilliant or all of the above as one might have hoped and expected. Notable supporting performance by Neil Morrissey. Otherwise: reasonable ensemble and directing. Three and a half stars.","LINE OF DUTY, SERIES 1"

It did feature plenty of cameos from Harrison Ford, Jim Carrey, Will Smith, Kirsten Dunst, Vince Vaughn, Sacha Baron Cohen and others. It's not quite as funny as the original (which was released in 2004) but offers plenty of amusing scenarios throughout. One of my favorite scenes involved Ron hooking up for interracial sex with his spicy female boss and meeting her family. As with any Will Ferrell movie the humor may not be to everyone's taste since you can't take anything in this movie seriously nor does it expect much from the audience.

480882,"Scream Factory brings a true slasher film gem to Blu-ray for fans to enjoy in high-definition. 1983's &#34;Sleepaway Camp&#34; has everything one could want in a genre piece and more. Not only does the movie have one of the best surprise endings ever conceived, it also does a better job than most at establishing characters you can truly identify with emotionally.After a tragic boating accident, Angela is taken in by her kooky Aunt Martha and Cousin Ricky. Angela and Ricky are sent to summer camp to enjoy themselves and make new friends. Not long after arriving, a series of accidents begin occurring. Are they all mishaps or has someone returned to the camp looking for some type of retribution?Writer / Director Robert Hiltzik has fashioned one of the finest examples of the slasher genre with &#34;Sleepaway Camp.&#34; All the right ingredients are here. There's suspense, mystery, gore, and characters you actually feel sorry for. Don't get me wrong. You also want to see several of them die as well.The &#34;Sleepaway Camp&#34; Blu-ray + DVD Combo Pack Collector's Edition is presented in 1080p High-Definition Widescreen (1.78:1). The Blu-ray was made from a new 2K scan of the original camera negative. The picture isn't perfect by any means, but it's superior in comparison to VHS copies of the film.A DTS-HD Master Audio Mono mix assaults your ears with every beautifully over-exaggerated scream of a victim. Edward Bilous's musical score perfectly enhances all the action and violence occurring onscreen. All the environmental sounds you could expect to hear at camp blare out at the audience.Scream Factory packs the &#34;Sleepaway Camp&#34; Blu-ray + DVD Combo Pack Collector's Edition with loads of bonus material. Actors Felissa Rose and Jonathan Tierston provide new commentary for the movie. The original commentary with Director/Writer Robert Hiltzik, Felissa Rose, and Webmaster Jeff Hayes is found, too. It also features new interviews with the cast and crew, a scrapbook, Jeff Hayes' short film entitled &#34;Judy,&#34; a theatrical trailer, and more.The &#34;Sleepaway Camp&#34; Blu-ray + DVD Combo Pack Collector's Edition is unrated and contains bloody graphic violence, language, adult situations, and nudity. Let's just say a lot of bloodshed takes place onscreen. A shocking scene at the end of the movie will leave a visual impression on the viewer they'll never forget.I can't think of a more perfect film to sit next to your copies of &#34;Friday the 13th&#34; and &#34;The Burning&#34; on your shelves. The new Blu-ray edition of &#34;Sleepaway Camp&#34; is an essential piece of slasher and horror genre history.

1631389,"CLOSED CIRCUIT combines an outstanding script, frill-less but vivid cinematography, and excellent acting with a plot that is rather corny conspiracy nut stuff. Whether or not you will like this film depends entirely upon personal taste (but doesn't it always?). I have a positive bias towards British films that rely on meaningful dialogue and slow, engaging suspense instead of the usual action-dramatics, and I really like this one. I realize, however, that many people have just the opposite bias.Though the storyline is nothing special and has a few holes and stretches, it also has its share of little surprises and turnabouts. If you like to dissect films for plausibility, you'll probably find a number of things wrong with CLOSED CIRCUIT. As a lot of the other reviews here indicate, people who want colorful special effects, frequent changes in scenery, fast excitement and such are also likely to be bored with CC. Nevertheless, if you don't always demand such elements and are willing to watch this film in fairly non-analytical mode, you'll probably find that CC's more intelligent qualities make for a compelling show.Bana and Hall give their usual good performances, and young Hasancan Cifci is especially impressive as the accused terrorist's 14-year-old son who's a crucial witness for both the defense and prosecution.",N/A

But let's be honest, they are not, These are high tech video games with computer generated characters, environments and a manipulative, primitive and ridiculous plot with more than cheesy dialogue.The one aspect that makes these computer generated cartoons watchable is the music by maestro John Williams, whose talent as a composer is so great that he cannot give but the most wonderful and amazing music that elevates (not easily but manages) even these so called films.It clearly shows that by that point George Lucas had unlimited creative sontrol over this franchise and no Lawrence Kasdan to write a magnificient screenplay. What he ended up with is animation for 6 year olds with a phenomenal music. But it certainly has nothing to do with the Star Wars that people have loved since 1977. It's the stupidified, simplified, infantilised version of it. Too bad, because with a really good screen writer and a good director, like say Spielberg, Jackson, Cameron or Fincher, they could've made three awesome films worthy of the name Star Wars.

After Bette quit, the producers had her character magically transform herself into sexy Barbara Bach, a woman who doesn't even resemble the young Bette. They had Bette's voice dubbed in by Michael Greer, a noted Davis impersonator. It doesn't help. There is only one big laugh in this film. Her stepchildren keep lovingly referring to her predecessor as &#34;Mom&#34;. Eventually, the camera cuts to Mom's picture. Guess Who it is? I'm not even going to tell you. It's not worth your time.",N/A

1655289,"I'm a man in my seventh decade of life who has seen much and who has experienced much. This movie, I found quite by accident, but I'm much richer from having found it! I had not seen the actress in any role in years; I do not know why; perhaps I just had not found her movies, nor the male lead in several years; but, again, I am enormously glad to have found them partnered in these roles. I caught many lumps in my throat in several scenes, and the acting was so natural as to be a real event, which I was sharing all the way through. I cannot thank you enough for allowing access to this movie. While it broke my heart, it also was quite healing; and I could only hope that someone (anyone) might love me so much as that affection and deep-soul type love that was so manifest in this movie. I would honestly give it 10 stars, if that many were available to me. As my title suggests: It was not one's ideal of a &#34;thrilling&#34; movie, but it was certainly one that will touch your heart &#8212; and even your soul, if you have one that can be touched. I would gladly watch it again; and that is how I judge an excellent movie. My regards &#8212; Noel T. Manning",Still Mine

She keeps everyone fooled except her lawyer.  She eventually confesses to her husband who loves her so much he is willing to stay with her.  This movie shows that idleness gets people in trouble.  Instead of starting an affair to relieve her boredom she should have gotten a job or dismiss the servants and do all the cleaning and cooking herself.  BELIEVE ME, that would have kept her busy.  Still a wonderful black-and-white classic with great photography, wonderful music, and a fine performance by Davis.  You almost want her to get away with her crime.  Highly recommended.",N/A

1691727,"Don&#8217;t let the title fool you; this is not a new addition to the AMERICAN PIE franchise, nor is it the suggested title for the next HANGOVER film.  BUCK WILD is a rowdy, darkly humorous venture into zombie-comedy territory, filled with gore and goofs alike.  And while it is not perfect, it is a lot of fun and certainly worthy of attention.As I&#8217;ve mentioned in previous posts, I love horror-comedies.  I&#8217;m always fascinated to see how humor can be interjected into some of horror&#8217;s most popular and intense concepts.  And because I&#8217;m a huge zombie fan, finding humor with them makes a film that much better.BUCK WILD is shot well for the most part and looks good onscreen.  There are a couple of camera shots that made me raise an eyebrow and wonder why that particular spot was chosen; but otherwise, the cinematography is pretty solid.  Likewise, the acting is good, too.  I particularly like the diversity of the cast.  Director Tyler Glodt did a great job in casting the four primary characters, and each actor is to be commended in their roles.  They are an over-the-top bunch with larger than life personas, but that works perfectly in a film like this.The special effects are mostly well done, and there&#8217;s plenty of gore to go around.  From mutilated animals to gunshot blood-sprays, we get a nice dose of carnage onscreen.  I say the effects are mostly well done because some of the zombie effects looked a bit cheap.  The close-up shots look great&#8230;but there are several background zombies that barely look made up at all.  I figured this was due to budget constraints, but it was noticeable enough to bring up.Despite it&#8217;s small flaws, BUCK WILD is entertaining and funny.  The characters are boisterous and full of life, which injects a lot of energy into this production.  I recommend giving the film a look if you&#8217;re looking for off-the-wall fun and zany, gory comedy.  The film is available now in a variety of formats.",Buck Wild

345408,"For the longest times, I used to love this movie as a smaller child, but now, as a teen-ager in an adult body, I now realize why people lambaste this movie. I now realized that what was special given to Tom and Jerry is taken away. When T&J were silent, they use their slapstick ability and that's what made them special from their beginning. On here, when they talk, they've lost that special ability and this movie is a fix. For the record, I still like watching Tom Cat talking, not Jerry Mouse, on this movie. I can't believe I'm saying this, but this should have been a Europe only release because there is a movie that never made it here in the US called ""The Magician's Hat"" and compare to ""TAJ:TM"", that would have made a smash hit. There are other TAJ movies that are a lot better than this, like their version of ""The Nut Cracker"" or ""The Wizard of Oz"". Yep. There are more slapsticks and silence in those than this clunker.

1385552,"I dove into my TV settings the day I purchased it.  I made some changes that I read about online, things like white balance and auto smoothing.  I was never unhappy with the picture but always figured there was more that I could do, I just didn't know where to start.  This package was just what I needed.There are a few home theater tweaking DVDs out there but most cost twice as much and, from my understanding, don't offer anything more.  This package included 2 BluRays, the first is the meat and potatoes with all manner of patterns and instructions on how to use them.  There is also a color filter included that is used specifically in color adjustment. The second disc is to admire the work you have done and includes a wide selection of nature and Disney clips.There is a quick setup that covers the basics and, including the instructions for each section, takes about 10 minutes to get through.  My guess is that no one that buys this package uses the quick setup.  The expert setup takes closer to 30 minutes including instructions and about 10 minutes if you've used the disc before, if you're setting up a second TV for example.I learned much more than I thought I would from the setup instructions.  The disc kept indicating that my TV was set to automatically scale images and, as a result, was not providing an accurate image from BluRays.  It took me a while to dig through the menus but I finally found out how to turn it off.  The dozens of small adjustments, like that, made a pretty noticeable difference.  Even my wife, who does not typically care about that kind of stuff, mentioned the picture looked better.There is also a small section for testing a surround sound setup but it is not nearly as robust.This disc is easy to use, especially for the type of person that would purchase this kind of thing in the first place.  For the cost I would recommend it to anyone who has purchased a nice TV and wants to get the most out of it.",N/A

Bette couldn't stand Errol so she turned the role down. WB promised her a vehicle to make up for her loss in what has become one of America's best films(Gone With the Wind). In Jezebel, Bette Davis plays a head strong wealthy southern belle. A woman who is way before her time and shocking to those who know and love her. She is the woman men will kill for for her honor.

1554751,"It's about time an interesting/entertaining/action based movie was made that shows respect for certain basic aspects of religion and gives its due to some of the the past foundation traditions that modern civilization was built upon. (Sadly in  so many areas of contemporary culture there has been an attempt to minimize the importance of religious ethics, sometimes in a very biased ignorant way).I can already see the virulently ant-religious critics, skeptics, cynics sharpening their knives to criticize this film. How dare they mention &#34;God&#34;, &#34;angels&#34;, &#34;demons&#34;, etc.!!  These are not politically correct!! Sadly, many enemies of religion/films with strong ethical humanistic themes  have little to no knowledge of religion,(also theology, history). , and its major contributions to civilization. However, as a person of faith I believe that well  made movies that point to higher purposes (i.e. God), morals/ethics are in short supply. It's really good to see even Hollywood now coming out with mainstream movies (e.g. Noah & Son of God).This movie was exciting, creative, entertaining with solid acting and a solid script. The special effects were pretty good but that was not the overall theme of this movie. This was not just another horror/fantasy movie. This was a &#34;good vs evil&#34; film but that didn't turn it into a cliche. There are deeper levels here. I love the use of Christian imagery to include scapulars, sacramentals, gargoyles, angels and demons and of course the central ideas of God, the soul and redemption. Although a lot of these are from Catholic theology they also have a broader appeal to all Christianity, an audience that has been very badly ignored/dismissed by modern secularists and their ilk. I may be in the minority but I am really sick and tired of the domination of ever increasing senseless uses of sex and violence for so many films. Humanistic themes/values have really fallen on hard times.My wife and I loved this film and hope that it generates enough revenues/interest to lead to a sequel.Cheers",N/A
129157,"As a baby boomer, this was a favorite movie when I was a child. As an adult, watching it alone in the pursuit of nostaligia, I could see it analytically: a movie with some astoundingly funny bits that have never been replicated, but overall a little spotty and not suitable for today's adult &#34;Breaking Bad&#34; aesthetic.However, I now understand that what was missing was the ability to see this through the delighted eyes of children on first viewing. My son and his family visited recently, and I got to watch this in the company of my 8 and 10 year old grandsons. What a joy listening to their laughter!Humor these days is heavily favored by cynicism, and even children's movies are laced with adult references which often are rather dark. This is a simple movie, made in the post-WWII era when everyone had seen enough suffering for a lifetime and we were happy for 90 minutes of refreshing joy. We could use a little of this simplicity today!Danny Kaye was a comic genius, with a astoundingly quick tongue and wit, and this movie is one of his very best, especially for including youngsters.",N/A

562297,"This is THE must see parody of the Beatles story &#8211; an affectionate and clever look through their history using their alter-egos, the Rutles.  It takes them from their discovery in the Cavern by a manager fixated by their trousers, through to Let It Rot &#8211; a film, an album and a lawsuit.  Along the way, you can relive Rutlemania, enjoy the early success of, &#8220;A Hard Day&#8217;s Rut,&#8221; and &#8220;Ouch!&#8221; and the band&#8217;s misuse of tea...  I note that other reviewers have mentioned you should dislike the Beatles to watch this, but it is certainly shown regularly at Beatles conventions and is quoted often by fans.  Neil Innes does a wonderful job with the music (the later Rutles album, &#8220;Archeology,&#8221; a pun on the Beatles &#8220;Anthology,&#8221; is also well worth a listen).  There are also lots of great members from both the Saturday Night Live teams of the time and the Pythons, plus obviously the Bonzo&#8217;s;  with Eric Idle not endearing himself to Paul McCartney, Neil Innes, Michael Palin,  Bill Murray, John Belushi, Dan Ackroyd and even George Harrison in a cameo role.There are lots of extras on this DVD, including a mini documentary on The Making of the Rutles, which shows how a musical clip for Rutland Weekend Television introduced the Rutles.  Later it was shown on Saturday Night Live as a joke, after an appeal for the Beatles to get back together (oddly enough, John Lennon and Paul McCartney once saw an appeal for a Beatles reunion while watching TV at the Dakota together and considered going to the studio, but sadly decided not to bother).  The public reaction to the Rutles clip led to &#8220;All You Need is Cash&#8221; &#8211; this full length documentary.  Other special features include &#8220;Inside Shabby Road,&#8221; the making of the music of the Rutles and some deleted scenes, featuring Mick Jagger and Paul Simon.

There are plenty of fights, enough to keep the title from being a lie.  Red Hugh goes after the bad guy (Gordon Jackson as Captain Leeds) with staff and sword.  There's also a dandy battle getting into a castle (pity it was theirs!).  Lots of nefarious dealings and double dealings, grand speeches, a slight romance (with Susan Hampshire), and humor.  I first saw this back in 1966 and enjoyed it immensely.  It was not, however, a box office smash for Disney.

Sure it is thought provoking to wonder what would happen if a catastrophic event were to take place in the cold depths of space.  Ok, ok, so it wasn't the cold &#34;depths&#34; per say.  It's hard to say what a highly trained astronaut would actually do in a dire need situation, or what anyone would do in the matter.  It was funny though, using the fire extinguisher in a 'Wall-E' type manner to propel one self from point A to point B.  I guess I expected a lot more from SB considering all the hell that Jesse put her through.  And too, a given, that she doesn't do that much sci-fi, save 'Demolition Man'.  Another point, surely NASA would not allow an astronaut to even fly based on their psychological profile, unless depressing information such as losing a child were omitted from an application?!

There's romance, melodrama, hokey comedy, high-(electric) wire action and plenty of boozing and brawling from start to finish-- a classic-film lover's delight.

1633398,"This film had such promise, but then sunk in it's formulaic fashion. The film was so long, and got stuck in places, I had to fast forward at times. A great premise, as I said, but then...Greg Kinnear plays a novelist, divorced but waiting for his ex-wife, played by Jennifeir Connolly to return. He has two children, Samantha, played by Lily Collins, a college student,who probably has the best bit of acting in this film, and Rusty, played by Nat Wolff, a high school student. Nat Wolff has a promising career ahead of him, fresh faced and winsome. Both children have been schooled to be writers as their dear old dad. Dad is very successful, and has the scraggly beard, sloppy look of a writer. Samantha is promiscuous and Nat is not. Dad is still waiting after three years for his ex-wife who has remarried to return.The scenery is beautiful, the acting leaves much to be desired, and the ending clenched the dislike of this film.

95984,"Talk about inventing outrageously original creative 'madness' = would that be the Miriam-Webster definition for the early Works of director Tim Burton?!  I know he went on to make Big-scale Hollywood blockbusters like the 're-imaginings' of Batman, Planet of the Apes, Alice in Wonderland, et al - But........ I feel it's really in his earlier Works that you find the truly un-abridged vividly imaginative (and more than slightly warped) eccentrically macabre cinematic 'visions' = as if being allowed to enter into his mind's deepest and weirdest 'Dream-scapes' (wasn't that the name of an intriguing SciFi film from the mid-80's).Anyway, this film is extremely eccentric & unique = like Monty-Python on Steroids and uncensored, also with bad-hair (and no breath mints to be found, of course!  But plenty of dead parrots*).  Tim Burton's comically-macabre Work is also the very definition of: 'Inspired (i.e. possessed?) Imagination & Originality'!!And the performances really 'rise' to this occult-occasion!  Especially Winona (where is she now?) Ryder** and Geena Davis (both frighteningly charismatic & Awesome talents who should have received many more equally awesome film roles!) - and of course the actor who portrayed the Late/Great:  Beetlejuice, Beetlejuice, Beetlejuuuuu.......!!! (wouldn't dare say it for a third time)!I watched this again recently, and it totally retains its sharply cutting-edge originality & audacity!note*:  please say you are familiar with the famed Monty Python 'dead-parrot' sketch?!  I also think Tim Burton & Monty Python's Terry Gilliam are kindred artistic spirits (with a similarly bizarrely imaginative visual aesthetic!)note**:  she did give an authentically intense (though very brief) performance in Darren Aronofsky's intriguing 'Black Swan' ==> that was another courageously original movie (but by no means comedic)..... And of course, Ryder was the co-Star in the other great Tim Burton Imaginative Masterpiece:  ""Edward Scissorhands,"" circa 1990!",N/A

The cast of characters were believable and likable.  Anyone who has battled a stronghold in their life would probably tell you that they couldn't do it on their own.  This was the baseline for the story.  Cory, the main character, realizing that he couldn't stop drinking was the beginning of his recovery.  God gave him the strength to do what he couldn't do on his own, but I loved at the end how when he drives by the bar he slows his truck and you see him shake his head.

66374,"There may be spoilers.  This was Alfred Hitchcock's 53rd and final film.  And it is the last one in the Blu ray ""Masterpiece Collection.""  It is the story of 2 couples whose chase of a dollar intersects in a typical Hitchcock way.Blanche Tyler (Barbara Harris) is a phony psychic who is working Mrs. Rainbird (Cathleen Nesbitt), an elderly widow.  The old woman confesses that her now departed sister had a son who was whisked off into the unknown shortly after he was born.  The wealthy Rainbird family couldn't withstand the scandal of a bastard child being born into the family.  Mrs. Rainbird offers to pay Blanch $10 thousand if she can locate the now 40-something man who will inherit her fortune.Blanche's cab driving boyfriend, George Lumley (Bruce Dern), agrees to do the legwork in an attempt to locate the man.  It turns out the man he seeks is a kidnapper and ransom seeking jeweler now known as Arthur Adamson (William Devane) who killed his foster parents in a fire and faked his own death.  Adamson's partner in crime is Fran (Karen Black).  Together they kidnap powerful people who are known to have expensive pieces of jewelry.This Hitchcock film is a bit of a lark and quite whimsical at times.  Blanch, in particular, is a little wacky.  There are too many plot holes, instances of scene continuity, and in one case, a downright ridiculous scene (Blanche and George racing down the mountain with no brakes), to say that this is one of Hitchcock's best films.  Still it was mostly enjoyable and fun to watch.This particular Blu ray disc is certainly not of the same video quality as others in the Hitchcock collection.  I didn't have a DVD to compare it to but I can't imagine it would be much different.  Everything you would expect on a Blu ray transfer is missing here.  Poor contrast, color, scene variations.  Not good.  It has a 1080p resolution and a 1.85:1 aspect ratio.  It comes with English SDH and Spanish subtitles.

1683401,"When I first heard about this film when it was originally titled &#34;The Tomb&#34;, i couldn't wait to see it! A Sly and Arnie team-up action thriller, this is the movie we had been waiting years to see! Despite not being hits at the box office, I really enjoyed The Last Stand and Bullet to the Head so I was very excited to see Escape Plan and hoped it would be up there with the other previously released films.While the film had a good start and some decent moments, it ended up being one of the biggest disappointments of the year for me. First off, the film despite starring two of the biggest action stars of all time, feels much more like a generic prison escape thriller than an action movie. It does have action here and there, but not nearly as much as you'd expect. And without enough action, there just isn't enough there to keep the film entertaining for it's nearly 2 hour runtime. While Arnold who looked like he was having a blast was very fun to watch, Stallone looked tired and seemed like he really didn't want to be there and just showed up for a paycheck. I love Stallone, but he really did take some of the much needed energy out of a film that was in need of it. The story was interesting for the first half of the film, but I felt like it really dragged around the halfway point and really wanted it to wrap things up. The action that is in the film is actually very good and the climax which goes on for a good 20 minutes is awesome!It did have it's moments, but being a huge fan of the two actors, I couldn't help but feel extremely letdown. It just felt dull and rather generic for what it could've been. Worth renting, but it's just disappointing knowing how great this could've been. I'd recommend The Last Stand, Bullet to the Head, or Homefront if you are looking for 80's-esque action films.",N/A

The woman is fairly modestly clothed, shirt and short shorts, but she keeps it all on, and I didn't notice any zoom-ins on parts of her body, or &#34;checking her out&#34; in a sexual way.

I'd say this script is probablyon a similar level with Inglorious Bastards, but a few notches below Pulp Fiction.As stated in my review of Vol. 1, information and build-up was missing, but this moviedelivered it, and it was perfect.Now once again, I find myself ripping on a movie that a very large percent of people love, and to be completely honest,I hold to my opinion that this movie, while necessary to the story, is an improvement over the first installmentAnd for the Bottom Line, I will say Kill Bill Vol. 2 is an;89%- Unquestionably better than Vol.1, but still relevant, Vol.2 is filled with nuances that only re-assertTarantino's talent as a filmmaker, and is a great conclusion to an epic and well written story.",N/A

1687669,"I watched the film trailer for Nebraska. It did not look good, or entertaining. In fact, it looked downright boring. Dry. Filmed in crisp black and white, and with a limited original soundtrack, Nebraska is Rated R for language. The 114 minute movie, directed by Alexander Payne, caught me off guard. 220px-Nebraska_PosterThe picture was nominated for six Academy Awards. Best Picture, Best Director, Best Actor (Bruce Dern), Best Supporting Actress (June Squibb), Best Original Screenplay (Bob Nelson) and Best Cinematography (Phedon Papamichael).Although Bruce Dern did not take home an Academy Award, he did win a Best Actor Award at the 2013 Cannes Film Festival. Fifty-four years in the business, and a solid work history. The man is talented. The award well deserved.Woody Grant (Dern) lives in Montana. He received a Sweepstakes announcement in the mail. It says he&#8217;s won $1,000,000. To collect he needs to mail the form back (with a list of new magazine subscriptions) to Nebraska. However, Woody would rather visit Nebraska to collect the winnings in person.David (Will Forte), Woody&#8217;s son, sells stereos. His girlfriend left him. Nothing is going right. When he sees the letter his father carries around, he tries his hardest to get his absentminded father to understand the announcement is a scam, that there is no money to be won.Woody&#8217;s wife, Kate (Squibb), is at her wit&#8217;s end. Woody&#8217;s tireless efforts to reach Nebraska on foot are causing the family to consider placing Woody in a retirement home. David steps up. He needs a break from life, anyway. He loads his father into the car and plans to take him to Nebraska, hoping to bond and salvage a relationship that was never good anyway. When family and old friends learn of Woody&#8217;s &#8220;good fortune,&#8221; everyone feels they deserve a piece of the pie.Squibb, Devin Ratray and Tim Driscoll &#8211;who play David&#8217;s cousins&#8211; are hysterical. Forte is the straight man. Dern is slow and calculated with nothing much to say, but everything he says either comes out profound or comical.I loved the movie. I highly recommend it. Highly! 5 out of 5 Stars, easily. Easily! Throughout the movie, I compared Nebraska to Napoleon Dynamite. It is the same style of storytelling, with just a bit more drama. The one-liners are non-stop. I laughed out loud from beginning to end. The story was fantastic. The pacing was perfect.

746187,"SG season 3 served to finish laying the foundation of the many characters and relationships that serve at the basis for the may plots that play out over the remainder of the show.  To really appreciate the quality of the writing requires seasons 1-3 to lay a strong foundation for the characters and many parties involved in interacting with the core team and the many plots at the episode, seasonal, race, and series plot lines all being filled in at once and in parallel.  The long run of the show allowed for a great deal of character and story line development that laid the foundation for the long success of the show and the franchise.  Season 3 begins to finish off the building of the foundation and starts to work into the next layer in which the next couple of seasons take us into the full blown depth of the many story lines and ongoing character story lines that aren't shown in every episode but are continually being built on to make the show good on so many levels and allowed it to have such a good long run.  All the seasons are important until things start to wind up toward the end, but even then there is closure being brought to stories that started years earlier.  So you couldn't have the depth and breadth without all the laying of the foundations to the many characters and stories that ran so well so long.

978564,"When the first America album came out in late '71 (about). I was in the seventh grade.  It made an impression with the obvious blockbuster hit &#34;Horse With No Name&#34;, but also due to the several other cuts that WJLN  of Birmingham, Alabama (an old station with a new progressive rock format, i.e., albums not singles) played.  Those cuts included Sandman,  I Need You, and Riverside.  There was something very Neil Young/Buffalo Springfield about them, but it was even more accessible and it grabbed the ear, then the real acid test of making it on into the psyche.  I can't really tell someone who wasn't born into this time how big this stuff so suddenly became.  It was as if an acoustic Beatles (3-vocal harmonies) had plopped right down.  Dan Peek has several interviews you can access on YouTube that make it clear it was &#34;extreme&#34; for him to almost overnight go from zero to practically having the means to do anything or have whatever you wanted.  This was at a time when the music business was approaching it's zenith in both cultural and monetary powers. It helped, immensely, that America consisted of three very talented singers who were better than average guitarists  and wrote brilliant songs individually and as a unit.Way back I rented the Live In Central Park laserdisc.  I liked it well enough to make a BetaHi-Fi video cassette dub.  There were, however nagging problems with the completeness, the poor editing, and the deal-breaker which was the horrible sound quality.  This was the real America at a stage where they'd had a sizable degree of success, but were still fresh and vital.  In the end it just wasn't a concert I found myself returning to for the reasons already mentioned.  While it would be wonderful to get a modernized re-cut video of that concert with sound from the actual multi-track audio master (it was as I understand captured on 35mm film and in 16-track sound), and since I'm just dreaming here:  maybe even widescreen video if 1.85:1  PanaVision or some other wide-screen formatted film stock was used to originally derive the 4:3 standard of the day.  Then that would be the America that would best represent what they once were.  Of course the wish for that old concert to appear in that form is not going to make it happen.  So, until, or if that never happens, I am more than happy to recommend America In Concert - Live at the Sydney Opera House to fans as the best video example of America.Gerry is the heart and soul of the group, but he wouldn't be America without Dewey.  I knew Gerry was prominent, but until this video it didn't register exactly how much.  t do mis Peek, more on certain songs such as  Woman Tonight,  and even more so with the realization that his passed away earlier this week thus making a real America reunion never possible, but this concert is extremely gratifying.  The sound is tons better here than anything Ive come across for America.  I do think the cymbals could be brought up in the mix to where they're more constantly up.  This makes a difference to me, but your mileage may vary.  Overall a well put together video concert of the later day America who holds the almost mythical tradition up of that original 1971 version without shaming it.  Of special mention is the fact that here we get a concert, finally, without the manic &#34;edit-nervosa&#34;  which is, sadly, more the norm today than not.  Yes, you actually can relax and feel like you bond a little with the band members before we're on to the next edit.  Mainly for fans, but like I said there is something really accessible about the music of America and this concert, without flash or bombast, is fine example of that.",N/A

1332579,"Even though Errol Flynn was probably the best Robin Hood &#34;The Bandit of Sherwood Forest&#34; is worth watching and adding to your collection. The actors are Cornel Wilde as Robert of Nottingham son of Robin Hood. Russell Hicks as Robin Hood. Henry Daniell as William of Pembroke Regent of England. George Macready as Fitz-Herbert the Regent's partner and Anita Louise as Lady Catherine lady in waiting to the Queen mother who is played by Jill Esmond. The movie was based on a novel &#34;Son of Robin Hood&#34;All in all you get a young Robin Hood striking his arrow against tyranny.  The Regent of England William Pembroke wants to get rid of the boy king and place himself upon the throne. A very common plot. Robin Hood gathers all the Barons to meet at Nottingham Castle and finds out from the Regent that the Magna Carta will not be used and the people will be taxed. Robin Hood is exiled from England. (King John Lackland was forced to sign the Magna Carta by the Barons.)The boy king is arrested and put in the Regent's care. The Queen mother and Lady Catherine go to Robin Hood for help pretending to be scullery maids. Robert meets the women and takes them to an old woman's house.(Cornel Wilde is not quite as good as Errol Flynn but he was a good actor. Robert meets Friar Tuck played by Edgar Buchanan and they fight with swords. I don't like this Tuck as well as the one in the Errol Flynn version. Robert and his father go to the old woman's house and Robin recognizes the Queen Mother. Of course Lady Catherine and Robert fall in love and she joins their circle. (The only downside to the film is Anita Louise. While she was lovely and a good actress she was to Hollywood looking. What I mean is putting the heavy makeup aside her hair style was to forties fifties. She wore a short dark green skirt that was a little below the knee, suede boots,a shirt and brown suede vest. She also wore a little hat with a feather. She wears this after joining Robin Hood's group. Anita Louise is very good in the role but she couldn't hold a candle to Olivia de Havilland who was beautiful in The Adventures of Robin Hood.The object now is to save the boy king. The action sequences are good. Robert gets captured and to save his life challenges the Regent to a duel. All in all this film running 1 hour and 20 minutes was a great swashbuckling adventure. The Technicolor was fabulous and it was surprisingly entertaining all the way through. Cornel Wilde can't compare with Flynn but if you want to add it to your collection it is worth the price.

104796,"High praise for this film comes from Hammer fans deciding WHICH HAMMER VERSION to pick. I never saw any other Hammer films. I'm rating this as ""cinema"" and it lacks the poetry and strangeness of the 1931 version. This is too much like a graphic novel with cardboard characters catering to viewers well versed in the story and satisfied with ticking off elements. Crude ""variations"" such as hiding Dracula's coffin in the victim's cellar are trivial and achieve nothing. The variation of deciding to cast suave Peter Cushing as van Helsing is even worse --- it deflates dramatic tensions and robs the film of connections with dark worlds. Here van Helsing is portrayed as a Harley Street smoothie, comfortable and relaxed. At crisis time, his soft spoken, polished advice + his relaxed air while presiding over desperate medical procedures are more appropriate to risk-free acne treatments than combating virulent forces of darkness. In the original 1931 film and in Cuppola's recent one, we see van Helsing's true nature as a half-frantic refugee from terrifying research territories, armed with knowledge too powerful to share. Those two van Helsings are buffeted by agitation, panic and crisis, revealing only a sliver of their discoveries and knowledge. Smoothie Peter Cushing conveys none of this, gently inviting us to glide our way to safe harbour.Other deep terrors are masked when we see Big D. preferring women who are no longer young. Much is lost by this. The horror of innocent young girls trapped in horrible futures vanishes. And surely Dracula himself would prefer & be able to find younger and more attractive women to spend eternity with than the ones he's selected here --- the last one being a middle aged wife long in the tooth, set in her ways and well over the hill. I can't imagine anyone watching it twice. As a Dracula fan, I wish I'd spent my money on the Mel Brooks' spoof DEAD AND LOVING IT.If you're not a Hammer worshipper, stay away from this one and go for Cuppola's version instead.",N/A

584004,"I was completely enthralled with this version of David Copperfield, Dickens' most autobiographical novel. The casting decisions were spot-on. I will never be able to read the novel again without seeing in my mind Maggie Smith as Betsey Trotwood, Michael Elphick  as Barkis, Bob Hoskins as Micawber, Ian McNeice  as Mr. Dick, Clare Holman as Rosa Dartle, Nicholas Lyndhurst as Uriah Heep and Amanda Ryan as Agnes Wickfield. They were almost exactly as I envisioned them. Just a few of the characters missed the mark for me; for instance, I thought that Steerforth should be much more slick and handsome - more like Jude Law.The dialogue and narrative stayed very true to the book. The homes and streets in which the movie was set varied from slums to sumptuous upper class homes. The rickety weathered boat in which the Peggotty clan resided was just as I imagined it would be.The story veered from blissful happiness, in which the settings were light and bright and colorful; to dismal, dreary and dark days, when all color was gone and the world was gray. The colorful characters retained all their charming quirks. Micawber rambled on, then summed up his monologues by saying ""In short..."" Mrs. Micawber ""never would leave him"". Barkis, a man of few words, offered forth the shortest marriage proposal ever heard: ""Barkis is willing"".The unctuous Uriah Heep was exceedingly humble. Mr. Murdstone was murderously mean to David and his sweet mother. Clare Peggotty had a heart as big as her derriere :)Though the movie is 3 hours in length, it still cannot contain all of the detail of the 750+ page book. I did notice the absence of a few characters from the book such as Tommy Traddles and Mrs. Mowcher; but their absence didn't really detract from the story.If Charles Dickens could time travel to the modern era, he would surely love this version of his fictionalized life story in which David Copperfield certainly is the hero of his own life. If you have never read the book, this movie will allow you enjoy Dickens' novel without a huge investment of your time. If you have read the novel, it's a great refresher and another chance to inhabit the Victorian world of Dickens for a few hours.",N/A

1678660,"Laverne & Shirley was one of the most popular sitcoms of the late 1970s/early 1980s. Created by Hollywood icon Garry Marshall (who had his hand in a dozen other popular primetime shows), the show featured two single gals (future A League of Their Own director Penny Marshall, and American Graffiti's Cindy Williams) working at a Milwaukee brewery capping bottles while struggling with being roommates, their love lives, and any other shenanigans the writers could throw their way. The show was a spin-off of Marshall's uber-successful Happy Days; Laverne and Shirley came from the same fictional background as Henry Winkler's The Fonz, and with that a television classic was born.The seventh season of Laverne & Shirley may be seen as the season where the series finally 'jumped the shark' (a term ironically taken from a scene in Happy Days where the Fonz went waterskiing over some great white sharks); needing a fresh setting, the show uprooted the girls, as well as their friends and family, and plopped them down in the glitz and glamour of Hollywood. In my humble opinion, this proved to be a creative mistake. Clearly, I wasn't a huge fan of Season Seven. Although the actors do an admirable job of tackling the roles they'd perfected over six years, the writing never feels as fluid or finely tuned as it did during the show's initial seasons. It could be that because the Milwaukee location was such an integral part of the show, taking it to California feels like the writers were fitting a square peg into a round hole. It's also asking a lot of the audience to buy so many other characters would uproot their lives to follow Laverne and Shirley to Tinsel Town.If nothing else, this set is worth a look for the performances, which are the one thing that make it worth recommending. Penny Marshall and Cindy Williams are at their looniest playing off each other, skilled comediennes who are able to wring laughs out of just one withering look. Penny Marshall (the sister of creator Garry Marshall) has pitch perfect delivery, often getting a lot of mileage from her sad sack/hound dog expressions. Following them to California are Lenny and Squiggy, played perfectly by Best in Show's Michael McKean and Used Cars' David Lander. Both actors are a treat as two lovable, marble-mouthed grease balls always making life a bit too difficult for Laverne and Shirley.The episodes here range from decent to middling; often it feels like the writers are stretching to make the new setting really work for the characters. Many episodes feature typical sitcom silliness&#8212;in one episode (&#34;Ski Show&#34;) Laverne and Shirley take to the ski slopes in the hopes that they'll meet some eligible bachelors (wackiness ensues). Another episode features the girls getting into a squabble over breakfast cereal that ends with one of them getting a broken jaw (&#34;It Only Hurts When I Breathe&#34;). The one episode that did make me laugh more than usual featured Laverne being wooed by a suave married man who is forced to try and hide the fact that he has a wife by putting her inside of a fish tank (Laverne's reaction is priceless).Fans of the series will be happy that Paramount has finally issued the second-to-last season on DVD. They should cherish this DVD set because it would be the last time the two ladies would be featured together for a full season. By the third episode of the eighth season, co-star Cindy Williams became pregnant and unceremoniously left the show (igniting a legal battle with the studio), leaving Penny Marshall to carry the rest of the series herself. While the ratings were stronger than expected, Laverne & Shirley ended its network run in May of 1983. Considering the quality of this seventh season, it was probably a long overdue decision by Paramount.Laverne & Shirley: The Seventh Season is presented in its original aspect ratio of 1.33:1 full frame in standard definition. The image quality for each of these 22 episodes is good considering this season is now well over thirty years old. Colors are evenly saturated and black levels sufficiently dark. While the image quality may not be revelatory, overall the series looks better than fans may have been expecting. The soundtrack is presented in Dolby 1.0 Mono in English. This is a very front heavy audio mix that doesn't feature much in the way of dynamic range or fidelity. Dialogue, music, and effects are all clearly recorded. Also included on this 3-disc set are English subtitles. There are no bonus features.Patrick Naugle, DVD VERDICTRead the full review at dvdverdict.com",Laverne & Shirley: Season 7

1683523,"For never was a version more slow, than this one butchered by Fellowes.Don't get me wrong -- I love modern adaptations of Shakespeare when they are well done, but I'm not even sure what this version was trying to be. It's not a modernized version, nor is it Shakespeare. The dumbing down of the language might have worked had there been any chemistry at all between two the leads (I actually dozed off during the balcony scene). However, as it's more exciting watching paint dry than these two, the loss of Shakespeare's beautiful language leaves an even bigger hole. There are also places in the film that make no sense because a line here or there has been left out, but is still responded to by another character. ??? Given, it was pretty arrogant of Fellowes to attempt to rewrite Shakespeare in the first place, the fact that he falls flat on his face in these areas kind of serves him right, imo.With the exception of Paul Giamatti as the Friar and Ed Westwick as Tybalt, the entire cast is passionless. Mercutio and the nurse, who are normally so animated (and written as such) are just as lifeless as the two leads here. If you want to do a modern version of R&J;, then update it completely and write a modernized script -- don't edit the Bard. Believe me, his text needs no &#34;help&#34; from you. This version just ruins the beauty of the language and encourages intellectual laziness. If kids these days don't want to learn to understand the original text, they don't deserve the joy one gains from reading, or watching interpretations of, the Master storyteller. The 1968 Zeffirelli version remains the quintessential film version. Do yourself a huge favor -- skip this drivel and watch that one.",Romeo & Juliet
77197,"This 1975 release in the popular Pink Panther movie series has Peter Sellers reprising his role as the clumsy inspector Clouseau. He's hilarious as usual, and sports many disguises along the way, coupled with an overcompensating accent to the point of people asking him to repeat what he says. All of this adds up to virtually nonstop humor. Playing Clouseau is a demanding role, but Sellers plays it to perfection. The plot isn't thin, nor is it too complex; it's just right. The 'G' rating is a bit curious, as there are several shooting scenes throughout the film, but that's how it was in 1975. If this film debuted today, it would be 'PG.' I highly recommend this excellent comedy, and to appreciate superb acting.",N/A
1424217,"This film is based on an article by Oliver Sacks, whose writings also inspired the 1990 tear-jerker Awakenings. Like that film, this one hides an essentially optimistic tale of human redemption behind a superficially maudlin, slow-moving veneer. There&#8217;s a fine line between &#8220;affecting&#8221; and &#8220;manipulative&#8221; in filmmaking, and which side of that line you see this movie on, depends on what you bring to the experience.JK Simmons (&#8220;Law & Order,&#8221; &#8220;Spider-Man) plays Henry Sawyer, a burned out engineer whose life apparently stopped in the Eisenhower years. His estranged ex-hippie son Gabriel (relative unknown Lou Taylor Pucci) reappears after twenty years, but a brain tumor has erased all memories formed after 1970. Music therapist Dianne Daley (Julia Ormond) reawakens Gabriel&#8217;s higher functions using classic rock on vinyl, particularly the Grateful Dead, much to Gabriel&#8217;s reactionary father&#8217;s chagrin.Simmons almost never plays lead roles, and it&#8217;s unusual for actors of his age to carry feature-length films, so we&#8217;re moving outside Hollywood&#8217;s comfort zone on two levels. Kudos for that. As Sawyer, Simmons plays a man who has stopped keeping up with society. His household decor is antiquated, even for the 1986 setting, and he refuses to learn computer-assisted drafting and other trade tools. Sawyer simply rejects all modernity.Gabriel is supposedly around 35, but looks 18 under layers of beard. He thinks it&#8217;s only two years since he fled his father&#8217;s constricting suburban world for Greenwich Village bohemianism. Because his tumor also destroyed his inhibitions, his classic rock also lets him tell his father all the secrets he previously bottled up, but because he creates only fleeting, isolated new memories, he never gains closure, persistently revisiting old pains.Because Gabriel cannot change or grow, Henry must adapt to Gabriel&#8217;s illness. A jazz purist, Henry must learn to appreciate classic rock, rebuilding himself as America&#8217;s oldest Deadhead. Even as his own health slowly fails, he becomes broadly hip, awakening himself to new experiences and previously untapped reserves of enthusiasm. Henry, in second youth, and Gabriel, trapped in permanent adolescence, finally make the connection they couldn&#8217;t in 1966.It&#8217;s tempting to fling feminist aspersions on this film. M&iacute;a Maestro and Tammy Blanchard as Gabriel&#8217;s love interests, Cara Seymour as Henry&#8217;s wife and Gabriel&#8217;s mother, and Julia Ormond as Dr. Daley, all play second fiddle to these two men. But I quickly realized: so do all the other men. This is emphatically not an ensemble piece. All characters and relationships are subordinate to the father-son dynamic herein.We could continue. The film situates the Sawyers, including hospitalized Gabriel, in the same suburban, preponderantly white, bourgeois environment Gabriel so ostentatiously fled. Except for one pretty Hispanic orderly, nobody confronts poor or non-white characters. And note, the only significant character of color is explicitly romanticized. Why doesn&#8217;t hippie Gabriel rebel afresh? Perhaps because, beneath its egalitarian baggage, hippie bohemianism was an innately white middle-class conceit anyway.This film&#8217;s small-budget, art house texture eschews glamor and spectacle, but this opens other possibilities. Because director Jim Kohlberg maintains his understated tone without bogging down, he permits opportunities for quiet humor and character development. It&#8217;s so quiet, in fact, that Hollywood-raised film children may get lost. Henry&#8217;s tear-filled climactic monologue will probably strike film audiences as sentimental, but book readers will appreciate its relative restraint and lack of bombast.Kohlberg probably spent more on soundtrack rights than his thrift-shop set design, lending the film a shopworn look but a rich, surprisingly nuanced soundscape. For instance, Peggy Lee&#8217;s version of &#8220;Till There Was You&#8221; looms large in the movie&#8217;s themes; but in one key scene, stodgy Henry replaces it with the Beatles&#8217; rendition. This willingness to leap forward seven years is remarkable for the character, without requiring aggressive directorial jazz hands.Browsing professional reviews, I&#8217;ve seen two basic threads: critics who hate this film because it doesn&#8217;t resemble typical Hollywood fare, and critics who embrace it for the same reason. Mass media insidership makes a difference. Audiences accustomed to, and comfortable with, Hollywood culture will find this movie contrived and lethargic. Audiences who haven&#8217;t internalized the lingo will enjoy the relaxed pace and subtle, cerebral themes.Fundamentally, this film is about the romanticized past. Set in 1986, it pits Henry, trapped in 1950, against Gabriel, trapped in 1968. But in era-hopping, it reminds us, the past isn&#8217;t frozen. As Dr. Daley notes, we constantly rewrite history in light of our present circumstances. What past, this film asks, would we agree to lock ourselves into? And when would we set ourselves free?",The Music Never Stopped

267660,"Terror Train, from 1980, was one film in a long line of horror vehicles for Jamie Lee Curtis. While I consider it better than The Fog (also 1980), it doesn't hold up as well as Prom Night (also 1980). In fact her best are the first two Halloween outings.The film itself is pretty standard slasher fare from the slasher boom of the late 1970's and early 1980's. The plot has a masked killer targeting six college kids (med students) responsible for a prank gone wrong three years earlier. Now they are throwing a large New Year's Eve costume party on a train. The prank was done to a kid called Kenny Hampson, who winds up psychologically disturbed and stows away on the train, after killing a college kid dressed as Groucho Marx and adorning the costume. Systematically people start dying until the conductor notices and all hell seems to break loose. There is also a magician on the train (played by young David Copperfield), probably to add to the entertainment value of the piece.Note: There is no final girl in this one as many students survive.Great movie for those already initiated into the horror genre.

And the film's final battle features cameo appearances by Ford, Sacha Baron Cohen, Tina Fey, Amy Poehler, Kanye West, Will Smith, Jim Carrey, Liam Neeson, The Ghost of Stonewall Jackson(played by a as funny as ever John C. Reilly), and concludes things with an unforgettable cameo from a very familiar face. This cameo will have any true Anchorman fan jump out of their seat and cheer.This movie blew me away in two ways in particular. 1- It was so much funnier than the timeless classic that was the original. and 2. The thing that separated this film from every comedy sequel before it was a very few references there were to the first film. Not one of our beloved main characters repeat any of the lines that made them so famous. Like 95% of the humor was original. There were like 1 or 2 jokes that didn't really land, but the other 500 they just nailed it. &#34;I did it and I nailed it! I nailed it!&#34;Well, that just about does it.

1203292,"Can I be forgiven for writing the third time about a 10-part mini-series? It was the Japanese sneak attack on Pearl Harbour that brought the Americans officially into a war that the rest of the world had been waging for over two years and they would not be ready to engage until nearly a year later but yet guess who thinks they won the war? Guess it&#8217;s obvious I&#8217;m not an American. This is not to denigrate the sacrifices made by those who went into battle and never came home again or did so maimed in body and spirit.This series is unique in making the war experience personal. The depiction of war is brutal and the enemy fanatical but it is the personal details that bring the horror of war home to us. Eugene Sledge would not be the first doctor&#8217;s son whose Father tried to keep him away from a war. Their ongoing relationship begins and ends the series. The startling normalcy of life back home is in stark contrast to the experience of the Marines on those small pieces of coral in the vast Pacific. There the jungle, the insects, the critters, and endemic diseases were every bit as much a danger as the enemy. Wars are won and lost on the stomachs of the men who fight them, an army marches on its stomach and cannot survive long without clean water.The first landing contrasts arriving to find troops resting on the beach with the suspenseful march through an eerie and unknown jungle environment. Finding the abandoned enemy camp ups the ante then comes the rain.Several themes seem to be common to all war movies. Inept West Point Educated Lieutenants whose book larnin&#8217; ill equips them for the rigors of battle. Command decisions that squander hundreds and thousands of lives on meaningless objectives. Friendly fire incidents often involving aerial or ship to shore bombardment. Soldiers killed by their comrades because they did something stupid at night. The various manifestations of battle fatigue. The nightmares that last a lifetime after the war.Had I been a veteran don&#8217;t know as I could have sat through this series. Not sure that like is quite the appropriate word for it.",N/A
1567277,"Overall, I liked this movie.  I really like the Hunger Games trilogy of books, and have been impressed overall with the two movies I've seen, and look forward to the first half of Mockingjay.  The reason I only give it four stars is because I think this version moves too quickly to really develop characters the way that they are in the first book.  I would not have been sorry to have seen Catching Fire broken into two movies, or at least a longer first movie.  It's hard for me to tell if this is only because I have read the book a couple of times and know it well, or whether this is the impression that non-readers of the trilogy will have.Overall, the cast does a fine job of acting.  This is an entertaining movie, and I recommend it to anyone who likes action movies, dystopian themes, or watching women in a leading role.",N/A

In this case, there is only one candidate left, so there is no mystery at all, despite the fact that the killer's face is not revealed.

I applaud him for stretching out as an actor, taking a risk, and basically delivering the &#34;goods&#34; with his performance.  He amazes with his versatility in personas.  The film itself is just another take on the familiar Vampire theme.  I thought well done enough to provide a new slant and entertaining couple of hours of fun.  The supporting cast and co-stars do well enough so as not to detract from the story being told.  I give high marks for trying but 4 optimistic stars because, well, its not a James Cameron product here!

A civil war of some type propels the narrative and there are some interesting shots of a war-torn, militia-infested and dilapidated town populated by various idiosyncratic types --ranging from religious extremists, hypocrites, panderers, misogynists and war criminals.

938683,"Basic Plot. May include spoilers, but the intent is to show the complexity and confusion.This film runs with three subplots that stay disconnected for too long. Charley (Steve Coogan) and Mamie (Lisa Kudrow) are step siblings who have a child together, except Charley thinks it was aborted. The child was put up for adoption. Oh yeah, Charley is gay and Mamie is having an affair with her masseuse. Charley believes his partner Gil (David Sutcliffe) is the biological father of  the child of a lesbian couple through sperm he had donated. A bad independent film maker (Jesse Bradford) convinces Mamie to go look for her son so he can film it, even though the son doesn't want to be found. Meanwhile Otis (Jason Ritter) rich son of Tom Arnold is gay...he thinks, but scores with Jude (Maggie Gyllenhaal) who also sleeps with dad, and becomes pregnant seeking the advice of Mamie who works at the clinic.The film attempts to be clever with printed material to the side, the way VH-1 tries to be clever with &#34;Pop Up Videos&#34; except VH-1 is better. The writers try to be funny with dysfunctional people in unusual relationships, but fails due to the complexity of the plot.

1687547,"Nebraska started out slow and for the most part remained that way. Instead of the fast cuts and brisk action of most of today's films, this one took its time and slowly built and developed its characters and story.Bruce Dern delivers a great performance and Will Forte and June Squibb -- as his son and wife, respectively -- are also good, but I felt that the rest of the cast were not that great. Their dialogue delivery felt like reading rather than speaking naturally and at least one of the camera compositions/framing was questionable (the scene in which the father and son exit their vehicle and meet &#34;Aunt Martha,&#34; the camera framing is such that their feet are cut right at the ankle -- which is frowned upon and thought of as unprofessional in film school).Having said that, I think the film benefited from being black and white and the dark humor sprinkled here and there kept the film interesting for me. I was hoping for a funnier film and a faster pace, but then the last 10 minutes of the film answered both of those issues for me. In the last 10 minutes, the actions of the son to get closer to his father and the way his father reacted to those actions resonated with me and made me feel something. I felt that if I hadn't endured the slower pacing and the so on, that I wouldn't have arrived at that point. In other words, if I hadn't experienced the film the way I had (weather it was good or bad), maybe I wouldn't have felt all the emotions that unfolded at the end.So for that -- for the fact that the filmmakers did a good job tying up the story and delivering a satisfying and emotional ending -- I recommend this film to all those who enjoy a great story. It may not be the funniest, most entertaining film you've watched, but certainly has a point of view and tells a story worth telling.",N/A

276997,"Viewed: 3/14Rate: 103/14: Cutter's Way is a brilliantly made picture that features a veteran cripple, seemingly unhinged in his mind, tagging along a swarthy handsome looking guy on a wild goose chase involving two murders. The only problem remains: does one buy his conspiracy theory? I really had a hard time doing so and ended up not believing it. We&#8217;ll never know after that suspenseful ending. The only thing that surprises me about Cutter's Way is that almost nobody received any accolades for their wonderful performances. John Heard is masterful, Jeff Bridges is at the top of his game, Lisa Eichhorn is wonderful, Arthur Rosenberg is a natural, and Ann Dusenberry is seductive. There are so many elements about Cutter's Way that makes it a terrific neo noir, and the downward spiral into a man&#8217;s fantasy is quite disquieting and real at the same time. So, I am surprised that Bone did what he did. Perhaps it might explain a lot why the theory of the dominant partner and the submissive partner is very credible, and charm does go a long way. All in all, Cutter's Way is one of the best films in the noir genre.",N/A

It is beautiful and haunting - having space, stars, and visions of the planet earth as background certainly creates an unparalleled perspective. But I found it a bit too sentimental at times, and the backstory for the Sandra Bullock character was just too over the top for me. I didn't feel it was necessary for her to have such a tragic backstory, and it detracted from the emotional relevance for me. I also reluctantly admit to being a bit bored in certain scenes - there is ALOT of space. But I still appreciate the beauty of this movie, and that it is so different from anything else out there.",N/A

1696579,"Low budget did not show on this well acted production about dancers and the AIDS epidemic during the early 80s.  The main characters were as professional as any and the photography and directing all made this well worth watching.  It brought back memories of what was going on during that scary time, when so many kids did not know and were afraid to even get the test.  Had I been a little younger and actually good at sex, I may have had a harder time with it.  So many kids, especially in San Francisco were living in fear as so little was being done, and people were shunning them because we knew so little.  Loosing someone to AIDS just brings this message home and I felt for them then as I do now, although  it is no longer a death sentence as it was back in 1985.  I think the movie tried not to be too cliche, although it is sometimes hard to accomplish.  The Dancing was wonderful, and the music very appropriate to the scenes.  I really loved this movie, it moves a little slow but it delivers the message, even the sex was necessary.  Highly recommended 5.0 stars 06122014",Test

1697321,"""A Million Ways to Die in the West"" shovels jokes, sight gags, riffs on old Westerns, and crude humor as fast as it can, figuring everything will be funny to someone in the audience.  It's a good bet, and this Western comedy works, although the humor is all over the map, not PC, and sometimes pretty gross.  This reviewer saw the movie with an audience that laughed out loud at some of the jokes and sight gags, and groaned at some of the cruder humor.Seth MacFarlane stars as sheep farmer Albert Starks, a nice guy who hates the old West and who as the movie opens gets dumped by his girlfriend Louise (Amanda Seyfried) because he chickens out of a gun fight.  Louise takes up with the insufferable Foy (Neil Patrick Harris) who runs the local moustachery.  The lonely Albert runs into Anna (Charlize Theron), the runaway wife of mean gunfighter Clinch Leatherwood (Liam Neeson), who takes him under her wing and trains him to fight the inevitable duels, first against Foy and then against Clinch.The opening segments of the movie feature a lot of modern breakup humor, nicely done by Albert and his best friends Edward (Giovanni Ribisi) and Ruth (an hilarious Sarah Silverman as a prostitute).  The movie really picks up steam as it drops into a more traditional western storyline, complete with barn dances, gunfights, barroom brawls, Indians, chases on horseback, and a predictable but enjoyable romance.  There are a ton of cameos and the magnificent scenery is right out of a John Huston Western. Recommended as good entertainment.",N/A

1675505,"I saw this movie twice in theaters; first on it's Pre-Thanksgiving Wednesday premiere, and second for a friend's holiday party. And you know what? This is the best animated movie of 2013, to me at least. There was even a Mickey Mouse short before it called ""Get A Horse""! Anna and Olaf tied as my favorite character, though for different reasons. Anna is beautiful and kind, just like a good Disney heroine should be, but she's also fun, cheerful, innocent, and very energetic. She's also strong and feisty when she has to be, so she's not weak She reminds me a lot of Pinocchio (in the good senses). Olaf is really funny. When I saw this film for a second time, I heard many people in the theater laughing at his funny moments. Kristoff is enjoyable to, especially when he voices over Sven. Elsa, I have to admit is likable too. She reminds me a lot of Raven from ""Teen Titans""; shutting people out, fearing her powers are dangerous, needing private time, the list goes on. The musical numbers are enjoyable too. Much like ""Lion King"", I don't feel like I have a particular favorite. I just like them each for their own reasons. I WILL say though, ""In Summer"" and ""Fixer Upper"" are the film's funniest songs. I also like how their is true love, but shown in a different way. Sisterly love that we don't see too often in a Disney fairy tale movie.I don't know what else to say other than the fact that I really enjoyed this film.

Now for the film itself: There are some good moments in &#34;Red Planet&#34;, but overall it's more fantasy than science fiction with dreadful dialog and a fun, exciting, but extremely unlikely scenario. First, the timeline suggested, that is that by the 2050s humans have accomplished as much terraforming on Mars as pictured, is to stretch even an amateur space buff's credulity. Also, the Mars One ship is so massively over-designed for its small crew that it seems impossible to ever imagine how its construction could be justified. My problem with the script writers is with their wanna-be oh-so-cool rock-and-roll dialog, such as Gallagher's &#34;F this planet!&#34; nonsense uttered at the end of the film.The underlying faith vs. science theme isn't explored as well as it could have been.

1661391,"This tells the story of two brothers Mo, the younger and Rashid (James Floyd who played Freddie Mercury in the TV biopic of Kenny Everett) they are both British but from Egyptian parents. As such they have been drawn to the local gangs that deal in drugs and guns and violence. They live in Hackney which has one of the most cluttered number of gangs any where in the UK like `London Fields', `Hoxton Boys' and `Legends of Stokie' to name but three. Kids actually come from outside the borough to take part in the real inter gang rivalry.In the film the gang is a mixed bunch who call them selves `DMG' which is a code for `drugs, money and guns', that will fool the `Feds' guys!. They have full on youth swagger and macho lame sensibilities. Then Mo gets a bit too involved and Rashid wants to get out, but in between ignoring his girlfriend showing disrespect to his erstwhile `homies', he also develops a taste for more than what the gang has to offer, or will ever accept. Everything is then set up for a big head on collision.This is actually not a bad effort, it is well acted, shot and directed, but some will be wanting sub titles when the `kidz' are talking all `street', so be warned. The story has one foot in reality but is not so far from the possible to be of at least some entertainment value. There is not much actual bedroom stuff here and the violence is realistic but far from gratuitous so nothing to frighten the horses or anything. Director Sally El Hosaini has done a pretty good job in this 111 minute film. It will not be for everyone so if you want a full on action fest then avoid this one completely, but if you like a semi, gritty Brit gang flick then this might well do.",My Brother the Devil

631856,"Okay...first off, I have to priase this film for the fact that the hero from the comic books wasn't facing off against his well-known arch-foe (i.e. Batman vs. The Joker, Superman vs. Lex Luthor, etc.)  That fact in itself brings something special to the plot.  It was nice to see Liam Neeson play that ""wise master"" role that he's pulled off so well before, but now with a villainous twist.  Incorperating him into Bruce Wayne's journey towards becoming Batman definetly made him more cunning and dangerous as he knew all of Batman's moves and stradegies.  Cillian Murphy was creepy as the Scarecrow, bringing a sense of sophistication to the role befitting of his intelligence.  In conjunction with my opening remark, it was nice to see a lesser-known villain become such a threat to all of Gotham.  Also, his mask, or that burlap sack, was a nice touch.  We don't all have the resources to become a supervillain with the high-end costume to terrorize the city in...sometimes we have to make do with what we can find in the garage, and it worked out for the better here.  But for all the super-baddies, there was an element of realism in Gotham's criminal underworld, exhibited by Tom Wilkinson as the reigning mob boss of Gotham (the city's own Al Capone) and Richard Brake as the mugger who killed Bruce Wayne's parents.  These and others are just as great to watch as their more theatrical counterparts.  As for the good guys, there's a ""dream team"" cast that is so worth watching.  Playing Alfred Pennyworth and James Gordan respectively, Michael Caine and Gary Oldman gave these characters much more to do than in any previous Batman theatrical film.  Lucius Fox was also given a larger role than ever before and power house actor Morgan Freeman uses every oppurtunity to show why he has earned his spot in the good graces of the Dark Knight.  Katie Holmes was good as Bruce Wayne's friend and love interest Rachel Dawes, but I can't think of anything truely memorible about her role...I do recall her being uncorupt but not nieve to what was going on in the world around her, which kept her from even coming close to any sort of a goody-good, but I don't really remember anything else about her.  And finally, there is Batman himself, played by Christian Bale.  With the Dark Knight's cape and cowl having been worn by about half a dozen men by this time, Mr. Bale brings a dark intereption to the character that is a match for Michael Keaton of the Tim Burton films.  I won't dwell on his voice except to say that I do not nessessarily care for it.  Apart from that, this is a new Batman whom the city of Gotham and fans of all ages can stand behind as he embarks on his journey across the rooftops.  And with this film's excellent plot, it will indeed be quite the journey.  Enjoy.",Batman Begins

235983,"Say what you will about ""Superman III"" and about how ""awful"" it supposedly is, but nobody else has come even close, in my opinion, to making a truly ""good"" or even just plain ""satisfactory"" full-length live-action adventure featuring the Last Son of Krypton... perhaps with the exception of the pre-TV George Reeves feature film, ""Superman and the Mole Men,"" which was in actuality shot as a ""test pilot"" for the television program, so even this in the most technical sense does not truly count.Apart from his appearances in DCAU animation offerings (none of which having ever made it to the ""Big Screen""), NO ONE has yet figured out how to translate Superman to the feature-length film format... and make no mistake, ""Superman III"" is no exception in this. However, in light of all of the mishandlng that has been done of this character for the purposes of presenting him to movie-going audiences, ""III"" stands as the best we have to select from... and that's sad!Yes, the other entries are more ""action packed"" and ""grittier,"" but they all to the letter treat the legend as a joke! The thing about ""Superman III"" is that the filmmakers here have dispensed with all the pretense and have ACKNOWLEDGED the joke and treat it as such, and in so doing they actually managed to give this movie more of a ""comic book"" feel for the time and made it feel (dare I say it) ""familiar.""But let's be clear, I still want to see an AWESOME full-lenth live-action rendition of the Superman character and mythos, but I want something more *INTELLIGENT* and involving in its handling (would somebody *PLEASE* take cues from DCAU DtDVD projects or ""Smallville""), rather than the vacuous pap we've been forced to swallow thus far. In the meantime, while all the big shot producers with no love for (or knowledge of) the character continue to try to figure out how to handle him and his world properly, I can take comfort that there's still this one stand-out entry that, while far from what it should be, I can actually watch not only with a smile but also find a deep and emotionally moving ""plot-driven"" story that makes me feel like maybe they were trying to lay the ground work, albeit in a lighthearted way, to make the telling of Superman's adventures more engaging and engrossing.",Superman 3 VHS

The characters are extremely engaging and the mystery compelling. I watched three episodes the first night.  Tatiana Maslany is simply amazing. When my husband started watching, he had no idea she was playing the part of all the main characters because her performances of each of them is so unique. Each woman has her own look, body motions, facial expressions and personality. Her Helena is creepy and takes quirky mannerisms to a whole new level. Jordan Gavaris lends comic relief, kindness, friendship, the voice of reason and free spirit to the show. I can't imagine the show without his frank assessments of each situation and character.

For those of us who grew up with ""The Lone Ranger"" the movie was written as an obvious betrayal of these characters. Rather as serious subjects, The Lone Ranger and Tonto became the center of a farcical/action/comedy that demeaned the entire story line and left one bitter and confused.I swore I'd never look at this movie again but after a month or so I watched it once more in the vein it was written and found myself not as hostel and even enjoyed parts of it knowing what to and what not to expect. But over all it's a poor film and Disney never should have released it with the main character, The Lone Ranger, depicted in an almost gay light.

1632188,"Normally I'm the sort of nitwit to instantly dismiss a film I don't dig and quickly move on to something better but occasionally a movie will come down the chute that is so ghastly that I get bloody bleeding burned to bits and feel impelled to put index finger to keyboard. The Counselor is one such piece of cinematic claptrap and let me state right up front what I reckon is the one and only thing wrong with this turgid turkey: the writing. God's Holy Trousers but Cormac McCarthy is about as clueless about screenwriting as Charlie Rose is about everything. Besides Fassbender's title character, who just keeps muttering ""Jesus"" every five minutes in startlingly fake mental distress, the ceaseless catalogue of bite-sized profundities spouted by nearly every other character makes The Counselor sound like a dubbed into English version of one of those unspeakable French movies from the 60s written and directed by some self-appointed intellectual knob--Godard at his most obnoxiously supercilious springs easily to mind. ""The truth has no temperature"" intones a laughably unsinister Cameron Diaz. ""Gimme a farking break"" I intone right back at the screen. Then this doozy oozes to the surface, courtesy of a clearly embarrassed Bruno Ganz, a diamond dealer: ""To partake of the stone's endless destiny, is that not the meaning of adornment? To enhance the beauty of the beloved is to acknowledge both her frailty and the nobility of that frailty. At our noblest, we announce to the darkness that we will not be diminished by the brevity of our lives."" At this point I was frantically looking about for someone to shoot me. But this preposterous film just kept rolling on interminably. And then what about the countless cack-brained observations about women? Here's one of Javier Bardem's unintentionally hilarious pronouncements: ""Men are attracted to flawed women too of course, but their illusion is that they can fix them. They just want to be entertained. The truth about women is that you can do anything to them except bore them."" Well said, Javier, but did you know that the truth about you in this film is that you look silly in that hair and decidedly uncomfortable to boot? In fact if good actors of the calibre of Fassbender, Bardem, Pitt and Cruz can be made to look like total amateurs, made to seem so incredibly ill at ease, then the lines they have to deliver must be very bad indeed. I've read nearly all of McCarthy's novels but stopped admiring them when he started pandering to the masses with the less-than-stellar Border Trilogy--everything after these three went further downhill as far as I was concerned, not necessarily bad writing, just sort of lacklustre and ho hum. But this first foray in film is most definitely bad writing, comically and cringe-inducingly bad, and I just guess I am astonished that this dude could cook up this crap and think it worth anybody's time. Ridley Scott also resembles McCarthy in my estimation in that he too started out with a few humdingers but somewhere round about the time of Gladiator started to lose his considerable movie mojo. At any rate these two old geezers should have known better than to punish the public with this putrid picture. To accentuate the one star rating above I will add my own personal rating for tripe of this magnitude: Eleven thumbs down.",The Counselor
1250936,"I wasn't looking for anything in particular when I stumbled onto this low-low budget rip-off.  It stars former fashion model Jennifer Rubin (semi-star of A Nightmare on Elm Street 3), costars (and written by) the grandson of Dick Van Dyke, Shane Van Dyke, and poor Bruce Boxleitner who has maintained a long interesting career (this movie notwithstanding).This lackluster production is hampered by brief uninvolving scenes, a limited use of FX, sappy dialog, and negligible acting skills.  Everything's a clich&eacute;.  The story is populated with manly men and macho women (everyone is just so gosh darn plucky).They were trying too hard to make an epic on a shoestring budget.  They even managed to throw in a brief romance while the world is coming to an end because there's always time for sex.  The moral here is don't drive killer cars or talk on murderous cell phones.

Joan Plowright is spot on as a dignified senior who now lives at a retirement place of sorts. Each person has their own little room or compartment and while relationships between residents are brisk and shallow and definitely unexplored, Mrs. Palfrey is just around the corner from meeting a new friend from outside who begins to fill that gap. The actor who portrays her friend is devastatingly handsome btw!I enjoyed this movie quite a bit... though was left with what I usually feel of slightly quirky films; that I wish there were more 'enchanted aprils, Mrs. Palfreys, tea with mussolini and ladies in lavender' type people around to come together and to truly care about each other! It just seems so simple to do and yet the reality is, life isn't this charming! Which is why I guess these kind of movies engage the part of us who wishes life could be this way - more simple and straightforward.Another noticeable thing (and not to be a damper) in films like this is ...most of them depict characters who've some degree of financial security or even wealth. Unfortunately, especially in the US - many elderly do NOT possess enough income to live in these settings and must rely on family members, live in situations where they are isolated and without help and tend to live a much lesser quality of life.

But that's about all that is good about this film. The depiction of the Poles is one dimensional and Magdalena Mielcarz acting is very flat, although she is beautiful. The love story is strange, and only about the love scenes and the characters are so obsessive as to not make the story interesting. The depiction of Jews is at best, racist, and is a disgrace to modern movies.  The fight scenes are boring and gory and when *spoiler alert* all of the main cossack heroes die, they die pouring out their love for the great mother Russia, which is laughable. The torture scenes were excessive, the love scenes unnecessary and overall the film did not deliver.

265876,"I've come to understand the ratings system here and have learned to exclude them in future deliberations. There is always a vocal minority who are most passionate about a given subject and extol on it's perceived virtues. The reviews for this movie reflect this. I don't know why those folks were so smitten by this film.The visual curiosity of having different hued settings was clever enough but lost it's appeal as the movie dragged on. The inevitable isolation and demise of the villain was predictable and formulaic. The story offered no novel insights or revelations about human debauchery. The heroine was rather unsympathetic and vacuous, the lover shallow and the cook was merely another background set piece.There are many who might object to the content and consider it base and vulgar, though I take no issue with that. I have no problem with artistic expression in all of it's forms. My primary critique is the pervading since of arrogance on the part of the director who presumes this to be a work of genius. If a heavy handed jackhammer can be considered art, than so too can this movie. Helen MIrren is a very versatile actress and she did her naked best to make this movie work.

He was only 19 when he fathered our heroine and bailed out on her mother because his parents wanted him to go to college.* Rosario Dawson (&#34;Zookeeper&#34;) is the reason our gal ran away: Mom is a drug addict and a prostitute...reason enough, don't you think? Her actions are chilling; our screening audience gasped during one scene.* James Earl Jones (&#34;Jack and the Beanstalk&#34; voice) brings hope with his role as the white knight who comes galloping into our wounded girl's broken life, insisting that things CAN be better.* Ann Dowd (&#34;Side Effects&#34;) is Kathy, the practical and loving woman who provides that much-needed shelter.This PG-13 story is based on true incidents in the life of a pregnant runaway, with some very welcome photos of the real people during the final credits. I LOVE it when that happens! Amazon will let me know when the DVD is available; I always notify my JayFlix.net folks.",N/A

700014,"With the most recent Best Actor Oscar deservedly going to Colin Firth, it is not surprising that the vigilant folks at Acorn Video would comb the British television archives and pull out one of young Mr. Firth&#8217;s earliest performances.Although he is perfectly competent in LOST EMPIRES, the 7-episode series based on J.B. Priestly&#8217;s novel about the music hall era of theatrical presentation, which serves as a fitting metaphor for English society immediately prior to World War I, Firth doesn&#8217;t really display the subtlety of his later work. Fair enough. He was only 25 when this series was made.Still, he is a compelling presence. His everyman sort of face draws the viewer in and allows them to discover the wonder, the seediness, the fascination and the boredom of the theatre world at a time when constant touring was the norm and job security was simply unknown.It helps that Firth is surrounded by a stellar cast, including, famously, Laurence Olivier in one of his last roles. It has often been put forth that Olivier&#8217;s Harry Burrard is Archie Rice (the role he originated on stage and later repeated on film in &#8220;The Entertainer&#8221;) twenty years later, but that is an unfair comparison. Every performance of Olivier&#8217;s was a new creation and the only similarity between Burrard and Rice is their occupation&#8212;mediocre music hall comedian.Even though Olivier&#8217;s character appears in one episode only, the rest of the cast keeps the viewer engaged through to the end. John Castle, as Firth&#8217;s Svengali-like uncle, is a mesmerizing presence, and the deliciously lovely Beatie Edney is one of Firth&#8217;s loves (and arguably his most ardent &#8211; hence the sexual situation warning).The real draw of this series is the superb atmosphere. The old theatres reek of mildew and the less-than-adequate digs are so dank you almost have to hold your nose in some scenes.LOST EMPIRES was nominated for numerous awards, and deservedly so. It presents a slice of English history that won&#8217;t appeal to everyone, but for the Masterpiece Theatre crowd, this is a little-known treasure, to be re-discovered and savoured.",N/A

34387,"I got this on a whim, having a sudden interest to watch the original King Kong again. The special effects are incredibly outdated, but the cleverness that it took to achieve such theatricality is still refreshing. For example, a simple practical effect (though definitely not easy, I'm sure) involving Kong holding a giant log with people on it, where he was trying to shake them off into a ravine, incorporated dummies, a mechanical log, and a backscreen that played footage of Kong. On the screen it showed him violently shaking the log, with the log itself moving wherever his hands were, covering them up. In front of all this, the camera was placed in a part of the real set to where it looked most realistic, and the end result brought the scene to life. It was awesome.Aside from that, the HD remastering is surprisingly clear in both picture and audio. It's amazing how well the film has held up. You can tell from watching this that a lot of great care was put into reviving this film. The story, also, seemed much easier to follow than Peter Jackson's remake. His seemed too drawn out and operatic. This original version isn't so much based on the beauty of the story, but the rawness and power of its characters. The narrative was much more straightforward and no time was wasted on character shots (as in Jackson's film). Kong was still very ape-like in movement (which must have been such a crowning achievement in the eyes of his original animators).Most importantly, while watching this, I found Kong to be significantly more terrifying than the gorilla in Jackson's film... So, if you're a fan of this, or if you want to add a classic to your collection, get this version of King Kong.",N/A

I miss watching this movie with him and have tried to re-introduce it but he isn't there yet. I am sure it will come around again. I really enjoyed this one. Falling asleep together in the recliner while listening to the peaceful songs. Animation is well done as are the songs and voice acting.

963390,"As a kid I eagerly awaited each new Disney film.  Snow White, CInderella, Dumbo and on and on.  Back then Walt Disney was in charge and he demanded that each film have three things: (1) an actual story, (2) likeable characters and (3) something for everyone.  Since he died the studio has apparently lost the whole idea of telling a real story, having characters you care about, and nothing too scary or controversial.  I must admit that there were some missteps in his day (Alice in Wonderland springs to mind) but even his missteps were pretty good.  This mess has absolutely NO redeeming qualities.  The story is not inspiring since it seems like every one of the characters is irritating (especially Foxy) or actually repugnant as Runt is.

1450599,"Disclaimer: I am a diehard Tolkien fan, and I loved the first three LOTR movies that Peter Jackson made, despite the mostly understandable changes he included.For all those who say that Jackson has made a new version of The Hobbit that we can now appreciate alongside the book, shut the heck up. The amount this story was changed to make a &#8220;new version&#8221; of The Hobbit for people to like is equivalent to fan fiction at best and horrific corruption of the story at worst. It&#8217;s as if I wanted to tell a story about the Vietnam war, but Hitler is still alive and there is a foreshadowing 9/11 with not-so-subtle rumors of Bin Laden every 15 minutes. There is not a single significant event in this entire movie that didn&#8217;t have a big and unnecessary change from the book to the movie.Oh awful mistakes, how shall I enumerate thee? *SPOILER ALERT* Listed below are things the movie got wrong about adapting the story in the book to the big screen:The main orc should be dead before the journey began in the first movie; Legolas should not be there; Radagast should not be there; Tauriel should not be there (or anywhere, since her character doesn&#8217;t exist); Bilbo didn&#8217;t know about the Arkenstone beforehand; the dwarves were in the Elvish prison for at least a month before Biblo let them out (not just one day); Gandalf did not have any discoveries about Sauron like that in the movie, despite there being rumors of a necromancer and an encounter with him in the North (else Gandalf must have completely forgotten all about Sauron when he hung out with Bilbo later and didn&#8217;t wonder about the ring very much); the barrels with the dwarves in them had lids and straw and Bilbo rode on top (hence Bilbo&#8217;s nickname &#8220;Barrelrider&#8221;, not &#8220;Barrel-periphery&#8221; like in this movie); no dwarf was poisoned by an orc blade; there was no need to reference kingsfoil, as if PJ was remaking FoTR; there was no stupid dwarf smuggling situation with Bard at Lake Town; Beorn was a huge, muscular jolly man who only had milk and honey for food and whom they had to approach a few dwarves at a time, not some moping mountain man with a variety of food for everyone whose home they broke into until he transformed from a bear to said moping man; the dwarves did nothing with the spiders because they were drugged up on venom while Bilbo sang and killed all the spiders; there was only one black arrow and it was Bard&#8217;s; there was nothing magic about black arrows per se, the black arrow was simply Bard&#8217;s lucky arrow and he was boss with it; the dwarves were not such jerks to Bilbo by this point; Bilbo was sent in to spy concerning Smaug, not sent to retrieve the Arkenstone, of which he knew nothing; there were no orcs invading Lake Town; Bilbo was not such an idiot about taking off the ring when it would be advantageous to have it on (around a dragon, around spiders, etc); there was no dwarf plan to cover Smaug in molten gold (as if that would work, since he&#8217;s a freaking dragon and is immune to heat); the dwarves barely saw Smaug (if at all) before he was shot down at Lake TownAll these aside from the blatant overuse of CGI (sometimes really bad CGI), excess use of fight scenes (often ridiculous fight scenes) when no fighting occurred, the overwhelmingly obvious fact that Peter Jackson was making this into another LOTR movie (evidence for that is strewn throughout the movie), and the completely wrong tone of the movie for the story&#8230; all these force me to give this awful adaptation of a beloved story 1 star. I&#8217;d give it a 0 if it let me, but perhaps the good actors acting with a wretched script is worth 1 star. Shame on you, Peter Jackson, for ruining this story. It should not bear the name of The Hobbit due to its enormous deviations from the story in all except the ultimate summary, namely that dwarves go after treasure with a hobbit and piss off a dragon guarding the treasure.",The Hobbit: The Desolation of Smaug

If you want a fast-paced thrill ride, most of this movie won't give you that (but some of its moments will). This is a meaningful, mindful film.  Don't just sit there and watch.  Be engaged in it.  Be willing to look for the truth in it.  I would compare the thoughtful nature of this film to the emotional rewards of watching It's Wonderful Life.  Go with Walter from his hum-drum life into a world he never expected to see.  Apply his journey to LIFE.  If you do that, you will get so much out of this movie.I've never been a huge Ben Stiller fan.  I really like the Night at the Museum movies, but this goes beyond humor.  Ben Stiller as an actor captures who Walter is and who he becomes.  There are definitely funny moments, but they are subtle.  There are ample life-affirming moments for those who are open to seeing them.  I have new respect for Ben Stiller after seeing this movie.Visually, this is a stunning film.  My husband and I were fortunate to see it in the theater, and it was mesmerizing.  The music is also beautiful and very fitting from beginning to end.

I wish I could say I enjoyed this film way more, but I can't.Solomon Northup as portrayed by Chiwetel Ejiofor comes off a bit wooden and milquetoast. His angst ridden countenance stays the same for 90% of the film. The full spectrum of human emotion is largely absent from Chiwetel's mannerisms.There are 2 actors that shine through: Michael Fassbender and Paul Dano. Both convey the prime evil of white bigot slave owners. The director Steve McQueen seems to love working with Fassbender as he is in all 3 of McQueen's movies.The worst part of 12 Years a Slave is the under-utilization of Brad Pitt. The previews made it look like Pitt plays a starring role, yet his screen time doesn't break the 5-minute mark.Yes, the ending is a powerful one. 4 stars. Doesn't deserve any Oscars beyond a nomination for Best Supporting Actor.",12 Years a Slave

Such is the case in the latest DVD addition to the When Calls The Heart series that has been showcased on the Hallmark Channel from best selling author Janette Oke. In A Telling Silence, Jack Thornton (Daniel Lissing) is called upon to investigate the destruction of the town's church that was destroyed by a fire. The church's pastor believes that it wasn't an accident and asks Jack to look into a possible cause by Cat Montgomery, one of the women in town that has taken it upon herself to continue church services among the trees until a new church is built. But did Cat really have anything to do with burning down the church? What evidence will Jack uncover that will point to one of the only people in town to have purchased whale oil, the cause of the fire?While Jack continues to look for other sources of who purchased the whale oil, Elizabeth Thatcher (Erin Krakow), Coal Valley's school teacher notices that Rosaleen Sullivan fails to speak due to what her mother believes was caused by losing her father in the coal mine explosion. Yet as intelligent as Rosaleen appears, Elizabeth believes there is more to her story than anyone realizes. Especially when she seems more than terrified of a strange man that appears in town. Elizabeth believes that there is more to the story than anyone knows and convinces Jack to investigate the circumstances surrounding the child's fear. But will Elizabeth believe what Jack discovers or will she take matters into her own hands?Fan's of Little House on the Prairie will love this timeless series that Janette Oke breathed life into and with the direction of Michael Landon Jr have brought it to reality through Hallmark Channel. Now available on DVD through Word Films, A Telling Silence is the third DVD to bring this series back into your home. The romantic tension between constable Jack Thornton and Elizabeth Thatcher is pure romantic chemistry and show cases the lives of the residents of Coal Valley, a town created by the Northwest Mining company. When an explosion claimed the lives of many of the town's men, the women remained to raise their children and took it upon themselves to hire Miss Thatcher as a school teacher. Believing there is more to life than coal mining, she reaches out to her students in extraordinary ways.I received When Calls the Heart: A Telling Silence compliments of Word Films and Edify Media Group for my honest review. I did not receive any monetary compensation for a favorable review and the opinions expressed here are strictly my own. Having grown up with Little House on the Prairie, I have been a faithful follower of this series on Hallmark and couldn't wait to review this on DVD and add it to my personal family DVD collection.

1675843,This is a heart-on-the-sleeve story and in being that it edits out the grittiness of the real horror of Hitler's Reich. Far too many of the scenes lacked the sense of really being there rather than watching a feel-good movie at home. For example until the last scene bombs could be heard close by but little or no damage was visible. The bedrooms were vey luxurious by WWII standards and the fake German accents with the odd words here and there auf Deutsch were too much.

1084010,"OK, so there is the gig.  This show is all about apostate Mormons who leave the LDS church to follow some fictional polygamist group.  Actually, two of the cast were raised in ""the compound"" of said poly group, one was raised LDS and the other ... we have not really learned where she came from, but not from anything related to LDS.  The show loves to portray a really negative light on the LDS church which goes beyond the normal bias polygamists have against LDS folk.  The show likes to poke fun at religion in general and really can be quite sacrilegious at times.They love to drop ""LDS-Speak"" on the viewers, who if not LDS would not get the references at all.  Are they targeting LDS people as watchers of this show??  The LDS church as come out quite critically of the crude nature of the content of this production.  So I am guessing few LDS watch.  Seems the writers could have greatly benefited by having an actual Mormon help as a technical consultant.  My best guess is that they used an ex-Mormon who never really understood their beliefs in the first place.Big Love is full of gratuitous sex ... which is likely to be a BIG PART of what people are curious about, regarding polygamist families.  I imagine many are still looking for all 4 of them in bed together.  That would have ended all credibility in an already somewhat incredulous show.  Thanks producers ... for sparing us that, at least.Now ... with all of that negativity out of the way ... BIG LOVE is honestly fascinating when it comes to viewing the interpersonal relationships between the members of this family, both husband and wives, wives and wives, wives and the various kids, and relationships with outsiders and friends.  What a complicated world these folks (in real life poly families) must live.I could not do it.  One wife is easily enough work for this guy.Special kudos go out to Chloe Sevigny for her role as Nickie...the deeply indoctrinated daughter of the polygamist sect leader, and 2nd wife in the plural marriage of the Big Love family.  Her character is really complicated, conniving, OCD, bitchy, passionate, and totally conflicted.  It is always a treat to see what she is going to do next.It is a show worth watching ... but don't take anything they say regarding any religion too seriously.

1232660,"The Real Ghostbusters is an American animated television series spun-off from the Ghostbusters franchise. The series ran from 1986 to 1991 and continues the adventures of paranormal investigators Dr. Peter Venkman, Dr. Egon Spengler, Dr. Ray Stantz, Winston Zeddemore, their secretary Janine Melnitz and their mascot ghost Slimer.I won't talk about the technical aspects of this DVD set (episode order, restoration etc.) as that's been covered. The quality of the show however is worth stating. The first season was fun and had a couple misses but mostly hits, introducing villain mainstays like The Boogieman and Samhain. The 2nd (and longest at 65 episodes) season was when the show hit its stride, moving from a network show to syndication. As a result, the writing got stronger and more mature horror themes were explored. By the time the 3rd season came around, STANDARDS AND PRACTICES decided to make the show &#34;more kid friendly&#34; and changed the show to suit little kids by moving the mascot, Slimer, to the forefront. Some character designs were changed, voice actors were replaced and the show became silly. By the middle of season 7, the last season, ratings were falling, so they called J. Michael Straczynski, the series original script supervisor and head writer (from seasons 1 to 2) to come back. As a result the last half of season 7 was really on par with seasons 1 and 2.When I was four and five years old in the late 1980's, I worshiped this show and owned a lot of the toys that accompanied it. As a Ghostbusters fan this stands out as a highlight in the franchise, and next to the 2 80's movies, is probably what most people know about. This series was one of the highlights of Saturday morning animation in the 1980's and was largely responsible for Ghostbusters fever.

In this it's hardly unique: let's face it, the same could be said of virtually everything Hollywood produces.What makes this movie is how well it achieves this. I wouldn't exactly call it deft or subtle. It's more that there's a certain realness to the emotional subtext. A willingness to shy away from answers that are a little too pat or glib.Like everything Pixar makes it is served up with a certain amount of treacle.

Her character is impassioned, messy, and delightful all at once--a perfect balance against her co-star.  I'm keeping this disk (the set comes in two disks) and will definitely watch it again.  The story is a good one and makes for a Hallmark style family watching.  I really liked how both of them had to learn to step outside of their comfort zones and decide to change their lives--that they had used their aloneness as shields from hurt, but that they had to learn how to let it go in order to really start living again.The other show, Will You Merry Me, was an okay watch--I won't keep that disk though as it wasn't anywhere as good as the other movie.

1621220,"This bloodsucker comes from schlock-horror filmmaker Dario Argento. Rather than recreate some new basis for a Dracula film, Argento takes bits and pieces of Stoker's characters and just puts them in a new setting. Gone is the gothic castle in Transylvania and the long ocean voyage to England. Instead Dracula (a wooden Thomas Kretschmann) has a pretty decent updated castle in some little village in the Carpathians. The time is still the 1870's as near as I could determine but Lucy (Asia Argento) lives with her father, the village mayor. Harker (Unax Ugalde) comes from a nearby city to work for Drac as his librarian rather than being a real estate broker.Evidently Dracula has some little arrangement with the village council (excluding the mayor) where nobody asks questions in return for what, not being a victim? Right off the bat (pun intended), we see the comely Tanja (Miriam Giovanelli) become the first victim. Not until after she does a little soft porn shuffle with a married man in a haystack. As she walks back home alone...at night...in the woods, you know what to expect. Yep she's attacked by the vampire disguised as...an owl! Yeah, Dracula is bored with bats and wolves and mist and likes to morph into flies, rats and get this, a giant bright green praying mantis. What have I gotten myself into here?Mina (Marta Gastini), of course is Drac's ultimate objective as she is the spittin' image of his long departed original lover. Mina comes to the village from the nearby city looking for her husband, Harker who hasn't kept in touch. Rutger Hauer shows up 72 minutes into the 110 minute movie as Prof. Van Helsing and immediately goes to work dispatching people getting in his way.I've never quite appreciated Argento's work and frankly get a little squirmy thinking about him directing his daughter's nude sex scenes. I refuse to fully dismiss the film, however bad it is (very). I thought the musical score wasn't too bad. Kind of a throwback to the 60's. At least it added to the non-existent tension. The sets were fine - no scratch that - terrible. The 3-Dness was acceptable and not a distraction. But even the nudity isn't a big draw. The script is terrible and the acting is just horrible. Yeah, it's all pretty bad.The 3-D Blu ray is fairly cheap to buy (Best Buy) and isn't a bad transfer either. I only watched the 3-D but did watch just a bit of 2-D for comparison. The 3-D doesn't add a lot but the colors are fine. The contrast and detail are excellent as well. As with all 3-D, the picture looks a bit darker, but I didn't find that a big problem. Perhaps because the lighting was consistently boring in the film. The audio is DTS-HD Master Audio 5.1 and an optional LPCM 2.0. The cast is comprised of mostly Italian actors and it was evident most were dubbed in with English or American accents. Some of the dubbing looked and sounded just fine. Others just not. The audio is actually very good with plenty going on in the surrounds. There are Spanish and English SDH options. Extras include a 1 hour + ""Behind the Scenes,"" a music video, and a couple trailers.",Dracula Di Dario Argento

If you know anything about Mill Creek Entertainment then you will not be surprised with this product.  This is the usual Mill Creek offering.  Instead of the paper sleeves you get all three discs on top of each other.  All I do is buy a 3 prong DVD case and change the cover.  Nothing is remastered or enhanced at all.  If I had to describe the quality of this I would say that this is exactly what you get when they played it on the Boomerang channel.  No HD but it is very clear and it looks really good on my HDTVs.  Be happy with this.  It's clear, cheap and you get 33 episodes on 3 discs.  Don't get all bent out of shape if you think there are too many episodes on one disc.  I never do.  If it's not remastered and cleaned up why would you really care?  A DVD can fit more than eleven 20 minute episodes and still have good quality.  I make my own all the time and I put no less than twelve episodes a disc.  It really only depends on the source material as far a quality is concerned.

As one can expect Helen Hayes dominates this cast that included Van Heflin, Dean Jagger and Robert Walker Sr. (his last film before his early death). Walker plays the older son of a middle class family. He is brilliant and becomes a famous scholar. His mother (played by Hayes) is a liberal woman, while his father (played by Dean Jagger) is a High School teacher and patriot. His two younger brothers have just shipped out to Korea. While at college Walker becomes enthralled by a communist professor and joins the Party. He then becomes involved in espionage. He lies to his mother about his affiliation, but she eventually discerns his real intentions.The dialogue is outstanding and takes this film to the highest level as Walker character has to fight a personal battle over the view that the end justifies the means. His family are devout Catholics and this enters into the discussion. I will not expose what he chooses, but the ending is really moving. I was very surprised at just how well this film played out.

Sang-woo, a seven year old who expects to be treated like a Prince, is taken to live with his grandmother, who leads a humble and financially impoverished life, but is rich in love, generosity of spirit, and understanding of people. Sang-Woo, a product of big city life and culture in South Korea, must live with her in a rural, alien world, where he can't even get batteries for his games console! The boy's mother comes across as rather passive and unable to take responsibility, and appears to have dumped Sang-Woo rather than deal with him as well as look for work. Sang-Woo is intelligent, and as a result, he feels abandoned and bewildered. As a strong personality, he acts up and tries to take control of his surroundings; this does not go well, and he learns that his actions have effects on everyone. His Grandmother gives him the time he needs to come round, all the time displaying quiet love and gentle guidance.

898310,"I wonder if Sam Peckinpah's later reputation was read back into his relatively early (1964) &#34;Major Dundee.&#34;  Even in its extended version, it's a bit of a mess, though, to be fair to Peckinpah, he was badly treated by the studio.  His budget was cut, he had to compress the filming schedule, and he seems to have been denied control of the editing room.  Ostensibly, there was a lot of footage shot that seems irretrievably lost.  There were complaints when the film was released that its plot was incoherent and gap-ridden.  In this extended version, which includes about 12 minutes of footage not in the original release -- which I didn't see -- the plot seems clear enough, and the remastered soundtrack with an updated score sounds very good.  The video quality is fine too, and visually, the movie has a variety and texture that some better movies -- like John Ford's Monument Valley westerns -- can't match.  But still . . . it doesn't work all that well.Major Dundee himself, Charlton Heston, is a problem.  He lacks the easy command of idiom that seems second nature to John Wayne and James Stewart.  It's hard to imagine either of them in &#34;Julius Caesar,&#34; but they knew how westerns worked.  Heston, with his slightly affected, clipped, classical-actorly diction, just doesn't sound right, and although he inhabits his role well physically, one can't help feeling, when he speaks, that he belongs in a different movie.  James Coburn, as the scout Potts, seems totally at home by contrast, as do Warren Oates and Ben Johnson in smaller roles.  Equally problematic is Richard Harris as Ben Tyreen, Dundee's antagonist.  These one-time friends ended up on different sides in the Civil War, and Dundee accepts Tyreen and some of his officers as part of his troop on a mission to find and kill the marauding Apache chief Sierra Chariba.  Dundee seems to undertake this mission to escape the boredom of commanding a Union prison camp, and I think we're to understand that it is both quixotic and unsanctioned -- that his action, while not indefensible, is nonetheless a risk of resources at a time when the Civil War is not yet over.  That's an interesting circumstance, and Dundee has affinities with the obsessive trail boss that John Wayne plays in &#34;Red River,&#34; but where in &#34;Red River&#34; there was some heat and tension in the Wayne-Montgomery Clift face-off, there is comparatively little in that between Heston and Harris.  That Senta Berger (as the Austrian-born Spanish-speaking widow of a doctor) is brought in as a possible focus of jealousy to complicate the Dundee/Tyreen relationship doesn't really add much.  She is decorative but deserves more of a role if she is to be part of the movie at all.  One can imagine the movie without her part not being substantively different.It's not good when the circumstances of a movie are more interesting than the movie itself.  The situation in Mexico -- to which Dundee has pursued Sierra Chariba -- was interesting in 1864-65.  The French had installed a puppet emperor there, and Dundee's troop has to contend with French cavalry as well as Apache guerillas.  Some of the action is effectively filmed -- nocturnal action, cavalry charges across the Rio Grande -- but there isn't a consistently cohering visual rhythm to the movie.  The characters are written so that they don't develop; the script is uneven.  So what's on offer are striking moments -- the desertion of Hadley (Warren Oates) and its consequences; the tension that boils over when one of the confederates treats a black soldier (Brock Peters) as a servant; the comic sexual awakening of the young bugler whose diary provides the transitional moments in voice-over; Dundee's recovery from a wound while under cover in French-occupied Durango (Heston's most successful extended sequence).So . . . it's not a disaster, and one would like to have seen what Peckinpah might have done with the originally-promised budget and with total &#34;creative control,&#34; but the main characters here just don't create the necessary intensity.  Heston was a big star, with &#34;El Cid&#34; and &#34;Ben-Hur&#34; behind him when this movie was made.  With a bigger budget, perhaps Peckinpah could have matched the epic sweep of these movies and perhaps then Heston might not have seemed quite so out of place.",N/A

We're not bound by lines on a map or political alliances or government bodies of any kind. We are our own bosses, and we have a very simple job. There are the good guys, namely us and the bad guys, namely anyone who treats anyone else like trash to further their petty aims. We turn bad guys into memories. So mind your manners, lads and lasses or we'll blow your house down. We're the Elite. You asked for us, world. Now you got us.&#34;What happens when the ideals that Superman espouses and represents come up against the reality of a public that wants permanent solutions and a team of &#34;heroes&#34; that is willing to provide them?The Elite are a group of four super-powered heroes who weren't raised in idyllic environments and who have a decidedly different outlook than Superman, an outlook where might makes right, where heroes can be judge, jury, and executioner, and where ultimate solutions are to be embraced rather than avoided. The group consists of Manchester Black, psychic powers, Coldcast, energy absorption and generation, Menagerie, generating alien weaponized bioforms, and the Hat, a magician who can produce wonders from his hat. There are no lines this group is unwilling to cross, no boundaries that they fear to violate.Ultimately, this is a story about a battle between two opposing views of the world. And the debate itself is centuries old, with Ben Franklin in 1775 noting: &#34;Those who would give up essential Liberty, to purchase a little temporary Safety, deserve neither Liberty nor Safety.&#34; Initially, the Elite have the advantage, as they are more media-savvy than is Superman, they are seen as the next generation, they're taking down people like the Atomic Skull who everyone agrees should die, and so on. In fact, the Atomic Skull plays right into their hands, as Superman had fought the villain and had imprisoned him, only to see him escape and murder more innocent civilians before Manchester Black takes him out once and for all.These two visions of the world and of being a superhero collide as the Elite take on Superman, head to head, with the former willing to use deadly force to make their point. As Lois says in talking to Superman on the eve of the battle, &#34;I think they can beat you!... I'm sorry. But they're willing to go places you won't.&#34; I'm not going to go into the details of the battle or the outcome other than to say that it's a very satisfying and nail-biting fight and solution.The animation is decent, with the depictions of the Elite particularly effective.

1046083,"I was quite impressed by this little known war 1951 black and white movie. Below, more of my impressions, with some limited SPOILERS.This was the fourth film turned by Samuel Fuller but only his second war film, after the famous ground breaking ""Steel Helmet"" he made earlier the same year.  Both films action is situated during the Korean War &#8211; in both we can also see Gene Evans, who after playing the main character in ""Steel Helmet"" comes back here in a supporting (albeit important) role of Sergeant Rock.The action of the film is situated during the hardest moments for allied forces engaged in Korea, immediately after the Chinese Army intervened into war. A surprise massive Chinese offensive broke through allied lines and forced Mac Arthur in ordering a general retreat to fall back positions further south on the peninsula.One of the retreating divisions needs some extra time to withdraw orderly behind the river through the only bridge left, so the general in charge selects a platoon to fight a delaying action, at a narrow passage through the hills. They must hold the position until night and then they can withdraw and make a run for it, to reach the river &#8211; if the enemy doesn't exterminate or surround them before that&#8230;Amongst the 48 soldiers from this platoon is also Corporal Denno (Richard Basehart), an experienced soldier who certainly can take an order, but simply can't give one&#8230; But the butcher bill keeps mounting, ranks keep thinning and before the day is over he may be forced to give some orders after all &#8211; and very difficult ones with that&#8230;The strength of this film resides in two things. The first is a very realistic portraying of war as seen by the simple riflemen of a small infantry unit. The fight against Chinese soldiers is a very tough one, as the enemy is not stupid at all. The fight takes also place in the wilderness, in the middle of a very harsh winter and therefore the land and weather themselves can maim and kill, before even the first bullets start to fly. In fact simply watching the first ten minutes can already make you feel cold&#8230;The soldiers in the platoon offer a really good gallery of characters, very various in their perception, of world and reality in general and of this war in particular. In some occasions we can hear their thoughts, especially when expressing their most secret and passionate longings &#8211; and, no, sorry ladies, but in fact women play a much smaller part in those deep desires than one could expect&#8230;)))The sense of realism in this film was certainly helped by the presence on the set of an adviser, a very decorated veteran of World War II, Captain (later Lieutenant-Colonel) Raymond Harvey, who also took part in Korea War and won the Medal of Honor for his exploits in March 1951. Harvey and Fuller (himself a veteran of World War II) became good friends during their work on this film.Fuller wanted to make this film as a tribute to the simple rifleman of infantry and he made it clearly obvious in the opening statement just after the initial credits: ""This is the story of American troops in Korea early in 1951. It is dedicated to the Queen of Battles - the United States Infantry.""The second strength of this film is in the psychological tricks with which the director regularly increases the tension. It begins already with the title &#8211; in modern warfare, when in a battle soldiers defending a position hear the order ""Fix bayonets!"" that usually means that s*** really hit the fan and the situation REALLY stinks&#8230; The enemy troopers approach slowly and carefully but on another hand there is a lot of them and they have many surprises up their sleeves. And especially we can observe  the principal character watching with terror as his greatest fear is slowly but surely closing on him and he simply cannot do jack about it!Richard Basehart, Gene Evans and Michael O'Shea were all solid, good actors and in 1951 they were all in their prime and at the top of their game &#8211; and it shows in this film. If anything Samuel Fuller certainly knew how to pick his actors&#8230;Bottom line, this is an excellent war movie, which I recommend warmly (even if it a really cold treat). To buy, watch and keep. Enjoy!",Fixed Bayonets

It is a brilliant film; one of Allen's best in years, and the crown jewel in Cate Blanchett's film career thus far, which is saying a lot. While it's true that this movie isn't at all uplifting, it's an amazing character study of a horribly selfish woman who suffers a mental breakdown after her multi-million dollar posh Park Avenue lifestyle vanishes practically overnight, leaving her penniless.

1697333,"Director, Writer, Producer and Star &#8211; Seth McFarlane (Family Guy, Ted) has done an amazingly hysterical job of recreating, for modern times, a Mel Brooks&#8217;ish style film containing &#8216;farce humor&#8217; in this nonstop adult comedy. I haven&#8217;t laughed this hard out loud for a long time and &#8220;A Million Ways To Die In The Old West&#8221; was literally one laugh, shock or surprise after another.This is definitely an adult orientated film do to the language, sexual references, &#8216;poopy&#8217; humor and lots of inferred innuendos that you really need to pay attention because you could miss some very funny stuff. Seth McFarlane does a wonderful job of staging and coordinating both the visual and verbal jokes throughout the film with a wonderful cast playing everything as real and as straight forward as they can. (The outtakes on this film must be amazing!)It&#8217;s the story of a sheep farmer (yes, there are tons of very funny sheep jokes, sight gags and references), who is Seth, who is dating a not-so-nice girl played by Amanda Seyfried (Mamma Mia, Les Miserable) and then in the process of trying to propose to her, she dumps him.Enter an unhappy and unfulfilled wife of a villain who happens to be a very kind soul and wonderful sharp shooter herself, Charlize Theron (Monster, Prometheus) who learns who and what Seth&#8217;s character is all about. They have a nice genuine friendship that grows into something more by the end of the film and the resulting circumstances are so much fun to watch.Enter the husband of Charlize who is the territory&#8217;s most notorious and deadly killer played by Liam Neeson (Schindler&#8217;s List, Taken). Liam&#8217;s humor comes from the real evil nature he portrays as the villain. You really end up disliking who he is with some very funny scenes that he is put in.Then there is the always funny and quick-witted Neil Patrick Harris (How I Met Your Mother, The Smurfs) who plays the hysterical mustache twirling, cocky attitude wielding, mustache grooming shop owner who wrongfully swoons Amanda&#8217;s character over to his whims. Neil plays comedy so well that just his looks, gleam in his eye or a wildly crazy pratfall &#8211; because he was just given a super laxative - will figuratively keep you in stitches.Special note and bow to the wonderful performances of Sarah Silverman (There Something About Mary, Wreck-It Ralph) playing a prostitute who is always &#8216;working&#8217; and her &#8216;boyfriend&#8217; played by Giovanni Ribisi (Avatar, Ted) who is a softer, quieter Christian of man about to propose to her too. Now, the both agree not to have sex with each other until after they are married. (Boing!) They have too many funny scenes to describe, but they have some great chemistry on screen and there are always jokes within jokes with these two characters.With such an amazing score by Joel McNeely (American Dad, Flipper), some very surprising and funny cameos by Patrick Stewart, Ryan Reynolds, Ewan McGregor, Christopher Lloyd and Gilbert Gottfried (all good friends with Seth because of Family Guy) along with some of the cleverest special effects built around some very funny sight gags, &#8220;A Million Ways To Die In The Old West&#8221; was a very funny movie for adults and older teens &#8211; definitely not a kids film.

1691819,"So this is going to a review of the actual event itself and of course not the DVD because it's not out yet.  As far as the event itself goes, I thought it was a really good event but also maybe the saddest WM of all time due to what happened at the event itself and also what has happened since the event has went off the air.  I also would like to say that I watched this on the WWE network and I have to say, it ran pretty good for me.  There was one pause that occured during the main event but all I did was rewind it like TiVo and start it again and it played well for me the rest of the time.The event started with perhaps one of the greatest promos or interview segments in wrestling history as Hulk Hogan, the host of WM, came out to address the crowd.  He was on his game except for calling the Superdome the Silverdome (WM III) twice.  After he spoke for a moment then Steve Austin came out to also speak to the crowd and Hogan.  After he was done, then the Rock came out to speak as well.  I mean here you have maybe the greatest star of the 80's in the ring with the greatest star of the 90's and the greatest star of the early 2000's.  I watched with my brother and just said to him, &#34;Imagine if these guys were 100 percent.  Imagine that Triple Threat match.  After that we got a package showing all the events that led up to the Triple H vs. Daniel Bryan match up.So the opening match was a great one between Triple H and Bryan.  I don't know if it beats the WM 10 match with Bret and Owen but if not it came pretty darn close.  This match was back and forth and Bryan was really on his game (pun intended) that night.  I don't remember the last time I saw Triple H in the opening match of a major PPV but he was on as well.  I figure the reason he went on first is so he had the rest of the show to make sure everything else went off without a hitch seeings as how he pretty much runs the WWE nowadays.  Great contest that goes a little over 25:00 and well worth the price of the event itself.After this match we see The New Age Outlaws and Kane take on The Shield.  I, like most, thought the Shield would break up during this match but that was not the case.  The WWE made the Shield look very strong to the point that they defeated Kane and the NAO in just over 2:00.  This was a pretty good match.After that there was a backstage segment with some of the WWE Legends like Ricky Steamboat and Ron Simmons and some others.  Once that was over it was time for the Andre the Giant Memorial Battle Royal.  First off, some of the guys that were originally supposed to be in the battle royal were not in it for whatever reason like Christian.  The eventually winner was a total surprise to me but man what a win for him as he actually scooped up the Big Show in a slam position and dumped him over the top rope to win.  This match was actually entertaining for a little over 13:00 and I was not expecting that.After that we see all the events that led up to the Cena vs. Wyatt match and then it was the match itself.  First of all, I was kind of surprised that for the second straight WM Cena did not have a special entrance which is what he is usually known for.  Wyatt did have one and his was maybe the best entrance of the night.  The match itself was one of the best psychological matches I have ever seen.  It was back and forth and just a joy to watch.  The match went around 22:00 and while I thought it was good, I did think the wrong man went over.So after that we see some of the segments of the Hall of Fame ceremony and then the intro of the Hall of Fame class of 2014 which featured Carlos Calone, Mr. T., Lita, Razor Ramon, Paul Bearer, Jake Roberts and of course the Ultimate Warrior.  The saddest part of this is knowing Warrior finally made it into the Hall and just days after taking his place we find that he has since died very suddenly.  In fact it was the day after his last appearance on Raw.  Very sad.  RIP Warrior.After all of that we see the events that led up the Lesnar vs. Undertaker match.  What a freaking match with truly one of the biggest shocks in all of wrestling history.  I don't think I have ever witnessed 70,000 people take a collect gasp as they did when this match was over.  I know it's been all over the internet what with stories about it and some people actually have conspiracy theories about the match (for the love of God it was planned) so I think I can give the winner away.  Brock Lesnar does the unthinkable and actually ends the streak of Taker at 21 straight wins.  As I was watching and as I saw Brock hit his 3rd F5 on Taker I just knew Taker would kick out and hit a Tombstone and win for a 22nd time.  Never in a million years did I think the streak would end.  There are some that are saying that was Taker's last match and if it was, man what a hell of a way to go out.  For around 25:00 these two gave it their all and gave us a great contest.  Of course now the event is over we are finding out that Taker suffered a severe concussion and some possible minor neck injuries and that he collasped backstage once he left the ring.  For the first time in the history of WM Vince McMahon didn't see how the show ended because he elected to ride with Taker to the hospital.  WOW!So after Taker and Brock successfully knocked the wind out of all of us, we got to witness the Vickie Guerrero Invitational for AJ Lee's Diva's title.  I'm not going to name everyone in it but there like 13 other Diva's in it.  The match was pretty good for a Diva's match and it was rather short clocking in at a little over 6:00.  Pretty good contest but honestly if there was one match to skip on this event, it would be that one.After that match we get a backstage segment featured the participants of the first WM main event with Hogan, Roddy Piper, Paul Orndorff (who I didn't even recongize at first) and Mr. T.  They finally put their differences behind them.  Lastly, we get to the Main Event which would have Daniel Bryan factor into it now along with Randy Orton and Batista.  This was actually a really good contest with all 3 guys getting in all their patented moves.  There was one sick move where Batista set Bryan up for a powerbomb and he was lowering him for the boom, Orton flies in and catches Bryan with his RKO sending Bryan through the announce table.  Great match and a very satisifying ending about 8 months in the making.  We finally get the payoff we were looking for.All in all, the event was one of the better WM's that I have seen in recent years with just about every match being better than what I thought it was going to be.  It was sad that Taker's streak had to come to an end, but you have to remember, Taker once did an interview where he stated he didn't want to be undefeated at WM.  That he didn't want his career to be based solely on that.  In fact, at one time, he wanted Kane to be the one to end it.  I do wish someone younger or someone more devoted to the business could have taken the streak but I'm not as disappointed in it as some people are on the internet.  I'm surprised that Brock hasn't gotten death threats yet!!  The business with Warrior is truly a sad thing to find out simply because of leaving behind his wife and two young daughters.  I never like it when kids are involved cause it just makes it even more worse.  Warrior should always live on in our hearts and minds.  Thank you for the matches you gave us Warrior and may you rest in peace finally.This was a terrific event and one that I would actually give a 10 out of 10 to!

200355,"Abbott & Costello Meet Frankenstein, 1948 filmThis film assumes a knowledge of the Hollywood horror films it satirizes, else it may not be appreciated. In London Larry Talbot tries to call America. Wilbur has a problem unloading a wagon, but Sandra likes him. A phone call warns him about two crates shipped to the House of Horror. Mr. McDougall got them dirt cheap from Europe - the remains of Dracula and Frankenstein! Chick and Wilbur must deliver the crates personally. Their banter is full of jokes. &#34;Does Dracula know it?&#34; the comedy comes from knowing what Chick and Wilbur can't see. The missing contents lead to an investigation by McDougall. We learn more about Sandra and her interest in Wilbur; its business not pleasure. Larry Talbot arrives, and asks to be locked in his room.Wilbur and Chick arrive at the castle. They begin to search for the missing monsters, and Wilbur discovers them. But they disappear when Chick arrives. They all show up for the masquerade party. The full moon affects Larry Talbot. There is much comic action and confusion. [The special effects have advanced since the 1930s.] Chick and Larry arrive to rescue Joan and Wilbur. But Larry is affected by the full moon. There is a comic chase down the hall, and at the party. At the end the monsters are eliminated, at least as far as we can see. There is a clue to their next film.The horror films of the 1930s reflect the concerns of people. &#34;Frankenstein&#34; represents the man-made horror of the Great Depression, almost beyond control. &#34;Dracula&#34; represents the threat of a powerful foreign ruler. World War Two saw an end to those fears. The horror films of the 1950s represented new fears, about the environment or society. &#34;Them&#34; or &#34;The Creature from the Black Lagoon&#34; are of one type. &#34;The Invasion of the Body Snatchers&#34; represent unnameable fear. &#34;On the Beach&#34; was the ultimate horror film, one that may have prevented a nuclear calamity.",N/A

1647493,"Robert le Diable (Robert the Devil)  -  composed by Giacomo Meyerbeer  (1791- 1864), with  libretto  by Eug&egrave;ne Scribe and Germain Delavigne - was  one of the first grand operas performed at the Paris Op&eacute;ra  Theater back in 1831.  It  is a very long work,  consisting  of  five acts developing over a period of  211 minutes, or  three and a half  hours!!!The plot is loosely based on old legends about William the Conqueror,  officially the son of a duke of Normandy,  but  allegedly fathered by  the devil  himself:  he  was  born in answer to prayers addressed to the  forces of evil.  The time is the Middle Ages, the place  Palermo, Sicily  (in a tavern, at a palace, in the countryside and in a cathedral).  The language is  French, with subtitles available in English, French, German, Japanese and Korean.The story is rather complex.  Main theme  is the  eternal conflict between  good and evil,  developing  in this case through  the  moral redemption of  Robert (no last name),  son of a beautiful and  virtuous princess,  and of the devil himself.  Predictably, given his origins, Robert is pulled in opposite directions  by the devil - disguised as his friend Bertram (in reality  his own  father, although  unbeknownst to him until the very end) - and by an angelic figure named Alice  (his foster sister,  standing in for  his mother who recently passed away).  Both characters  try to secure  Robert&#8217;s soul for their respective final destinations, hell and heaven.  During the final act, Robert is about to sign the  papers which would officially turn him into a devil.  But, not unexpectedly,  the positive forces  prevail, he is finally free to move in the right direction  and  marries Isabelle,  Princess of Sicily,  another angelic figure, for whom he has been yearning throughout  the opera.Robert le Diable premiered at the Paris Op&eacute;ra on  November 21 1831,  and was an immediate success.  Fr&eacute;d&eacute;ric Chopin, who was in the audience, is reported to have said:  ""If ever magnificence was seen in the theatre, I doubt that it reached the level of splendour shown in Robert le Diable ...  It is a masterpiece&#8230;..  Meyerbeer has made himself immortal"".The opera  remained popular during Mayerbeer&#8216;s  life and - following his death -  until  the end  of the 19th century.During  the twentieth century, Robert le Diable  - along with the rest of  Meyerbeer&#8217;s work -  was still occasionally performed,  but lost much of its popularity, partly because of the expenses required for  the staging,  partly because of some unfair defamation  by the  Wagner  supporters.The present production was recorded  at  Covent Garden, in London, on December 15 2012, with the Royal Opera Chorus and Orchestra, under the baton of Daniel Oren.  Unfortunately,  the performance  received a poor review (three stars out of five)  in  the London paper  &#8220;The Guardian&#8220;,  following the premiere performance, on December  7  the  2012 .  The entire review, starting with &#8220;What are we to make of Robert le Diable in the 21st century?&#8221;  is available through the link:  [...]I tend to agree with  the Guardian.  Basically, the music is beautiful from beginning to end, no way of denying it.  But the staging, the costumes (some of which are just  plain funny), some of the acting, some of the dance scenes - including the &#8220;Dance of the Fallen Nuns&#8221; - lack the creative force that  made the original opera a  great success.The three stars from &#8220;The Guardian&#8221; seem like a fair rating.",Meyerbeer: Robert le diable

1681314,"In the early 20th century, a literary movement known as Naturalism caught on as war suddenly began to grip America once again.  Influenced by the work of Charles Darwin, Naturalistic writers wanted to emphasize the dark, harshness of life as well as man&#8217;s lack of control of the natural forces that truly guide his fate.  All is Lost is as close to cinematic Naturalism as I&#8217;ve ever seen.Robert Redford plays a character whose name is never revealed, a typical trait of Naturalism as these forms of expression look to stress nature&#8217;s indifference to man. This indifference is further exemplified with the film&#8217;s opening scene where the man (Redford) awakens from a nap below deck on his sailboat to find that a stray floating cargo container had somehow drifted into the side of his boat, puncturing it and resulting in the boat quickly taking on water.  No explanation is given for this circumstance or than that it presumably fell off of a cargo ship and, as fate would have it, collided with the boat.  The man is a pensive man; he does not react wildly or make rash decisions, rather he weighs his options and relies on his experience and skills.  Redford&#8217;s is the only character in the entire film, and he is also a man of few words; accordingly, the script for All is Lost is only 32 pages long.  Thus, writer/director J.C. Chandor&#8217;s film looks to explore modern Naturalism at sea as deliberately as possible.All is Lost is a riveting achievement.  As we watch this man struggle through a series of events set into motion by that seemingly innocuous cargo container, we are forced to mull over our own mortality and our own suitability to circumstance.  Last year, Ang Lee&#8217;s adaptation of Life of Pi beautifully captured some of what All is Lost attempted to capture, but that film was far more Romantic in its aspirations.  All is Lost instead puts plot aside and seeks to pit man against nature in a rigorous, albeit somewhat predictable series of events.  The result is a compelling yet extraordinarily minimalistic effort that does feel redundant at times.Earlier this year, Alfonso Cuar&oacute;n&#8217;s Gravity also pitted man against incredible odds in a far more successful way.  While both films depict man&#8217;s struggle with expertise, Cuar&oacute;n, like Ang Lee before him, understood the need to make the film a visual spectacle as well.  Thus, those films certainly utilize the media of film far more than All is Lost, while All is Lost relies more on Redford.  Fortunately, Redford delivers.  The sharp, witty con-man from The Sting is no more, but he has been replaced by a weathered and beaten sailor who may have the grit to do what Johnny Hooker never could &#8211; win an Oscar.  B+All is Lost is rated PG-13 and has a running time of 1 hour and 46 minutes.  It is a nailbiter and a triumph for Redford.  The score by indi-rock name Alex Ebert is also characteristically right on.",N/A

1291785,"**This review contains spoilers**The message this movie spreads is that an affair is a terrific ego boost if you're feeling lonely, and justified if the betrayed spouse is a cheater, too.  There's some minor heartbreak, but overall, everything works to your benefit.Jane (Meryl Streep) cheats with her married, ex-husband Jake (Alec Baldwin), and they both feel refreshed about it.Her therapist gives the ok as well, saying the affair will be a great learning tool for her.Her friends also cheer her on, saying she's ""allowed this one"" and assures her that Agnes, the woman Jake left her for, is the one to hate.However, it's hypocritical of them to hate Agnes for her greedy behavior but then encourage Jane to engage in the same greedy behavior.  Being cheated on first doesn't mean two wrongs make a right.And if her friends hate Agnes, then they must hate Agnes's son, too, because his innocent life would also get turned upside down by the affair she's ""allowed"".Speaking of kids, neither Jane nor Jake consider how their affair might affect their kids' lives.  Instead they're too caught up believing that if something feels good, you should do it.  In the end, they even both agree they don't regret their affair.They shook up the lives of their innocent kids, an innocent son, and an innocent man who's heart got broken (Adam, played by Steve Martin) all over greed....and yet, if they could do it all over again, they would?Both Jane and Jake were too self-centered to offer real love to anyone.  Jake insists this affair reveals his undying love for Jane, but really, it's just an excuse to run away from adult responsibilities.  Jake is a narcissist who treats people like toys and when one toy breaks, he replaces it with another.In his first marriage, Jane was a good toy who took care of him.  However, she broke when kids came along and she had to split her attention with him.  He then replaced her with a new toy who adored him...but alas, that toy broke, too, when she had a son and her attention got split as well.So history repeats itself with Jake running off to another toy, Jane, who's waiting to be played with again.  She's more appealing now because with kids grown, she can pay more attention to him.  And just like before, instead of closing one relationship before opening another, he strings both toys along because they're both still useful.The kids are objects to Jake, too.  In one scene, he manipulates them with fake tears so they'll pressure Jane into letting him stay the night.  He says he misses the kids but that's only because all that's required of him is to eat dinner (that Jane prepared with him in mind) and watch tv on the couch.  If any adult problems emerged, he'd split in a second.Jane's character isn't any better...though she tries to redeem herself, saying if only she didn't feel so much guilt and fear, she'd lighten up about this affair.However, for like 90% of the movie, she's giggling and squealing with laughter.  Her conscience seemed pretty clear to me.Also, like Jake, she doesn't respect the boundaries of marriage.  She starts the affair because she wanted to experiment if something was still there with Jake.However, because Jake is married, she no longer had that right.  Despite what her friends said, she was NOT ""allowed this one"".I think this sentiment was just to make Jane seem deep, but she's not.  She told her friends that Jake was an ""ex with benefits"", so she was clearly looking for a fling to boost her ego.  No deeper meaning was intended.I would've given this movie 2 stars if Adam had left Jane like he originally planned.  He was a decent guy who was too good for Jane.Jane flaked on Adam twice...yet gets angry when Jake flakes on her once.And the only reason she invited Adam to her son's party was to make Jake jealous...and yet, she accuses Jake of only thinking of himself.In rom-coms, though, serious problems get neatly resolved, so Adam goes back to her.  It's a bad move, though.  Not only does he deserve better, but in the scene before, there's clearly unresolved feelings between Jane and Jake.So I could neither root for this couple like I was supposed to nor support the warped message that greed is good.",N/A

Much is made of Don and his effort to get him out of it-but then nothing!  No follow up, no mention of what happened-I suppose we are just to assume that everything went ok?  There were several other plot lines that got a similar treatment but they were swept under the rug.  Perhaps its the beginning of the end?

181385,"This is writer Dean Koonz working with Director Joe Chappelle to create an all out swipe at multi-layered horror stapled with superficial science fiction.  The story starts with two very pretty women, the older a doctor, making their way to Snowfield, Colorado where the doc has her practice.  They arrive to find everyone dead, with only an occasional body or body part laying around. Soon the sheriff and two deputies investigate.  The most interesting character in the story quickly emerges in Deputy Stu Wangle.  Stu giggling his way through the investigation is creepy.and the viewer senses something is terribly wrong. One has to wonder about Stu's character development but before this strange lawman continues to be interesting he gets his face eaten by a giant moth.  Bye Stu? We see Stu again, but all too briefly.  So on the investigation goes.  This story has more car won't start, blinking lights, sirens,gurgling drains, ghostly apparitions, possessed golden retrievers, heavy breathing phone calls than any other three shockers.

Obviously love was the key, because that is what made it decide to leave the earth intact at the end. Oh and I forgot the nuke that detonates and then undetonates.

1654174,"&#8220;In the Line of Duty&#8221; is an absolutely fascinating and suspenseful thriller. It is not the typical crime committed, police solve it, and jury type of story. Instead, it involves the internal politics and machinations of a major British police department with quirky alliances and nefarious deeds and doings. The &#8220;policeman of the year,&#8221; a man with an unblemished record of serving the public, is investigated by a relentless internal corruption unit ostensibly for &#8220;laddering&#8221; of creating more crimes out of one incident in order to inflate his department&#8217;s statistics. He picks and chooses the crimes for his unit.An apparently &#8220;happily married&#8221; family man with two adorable daughters, he heeds the siren&#8217;s call of a former fianc&eacute; from a 20 years ago who suddenly surfaces in his life. She broke off their engagement in order to marry a super wealthy man from whom she is now divorced.Thus the true machinations unfold and they are well acted and highly believable, thus heightening the suspense.While this is labeled as &#8220;series 1,&#8221; there are no further episodes yet available. According to the extras on the DVD, the writer and director foresee a future with more characters and story lines.The DVD is closed captioned and totally satisfying in every way.

106356,"Meg Ryan - that should tell you enough right there.  There are very few BAD Meg Ryan movies.  Even fewer BAD romantic comedies that star Meg Ryan.Then add Nicolas Cage - who is not one of my favorite people in the world - but is a TERRIFIC leading man.  He's not devastatingly handsome.  He's just interesting enough to draw you in.  And this is his best work.Meg plays Maggie - a doctor who takes it very hard when she loses a patient on the table when she did EVERYTHING right and he should have lived, but did not.Nicolas plays Seth - an Angel who develops a strong attachment to Maggie and wants to help her and ends up falling in love with her.  So much so that he allows her to see him - which he's not really supposed to do.Dennis Franz plays Nathaniel Messenger - a former angel who decided to take the plunge (literally) and become human.  Maggie is his doctor and he guides Seth to understand more about what's going on and explain to him he can fall to Earth should he choose - and become human.The movie follows their path to claim each other.  The most sensual and yet innocently sweet scene of any movie - a rainstorm and Maggie can't sleep - and she asks Seth to stay with her - although he won't let her see him.

But Big E. won with the big ending.The Uso's vs New Age Outlaws: Usos, the younger team who have always bust their butts once again aren't tag champs. The Outlaws won with a rollup by Billy Gunn.Darren Young vs Titus O'Neil: could have happened on any show. Just remember  Titus won with a spinebuster powerbomb.Cameron vs AJ (Diva's title): unnecessary match with Cameron winning by DQ after Tamina attacked Cameron.Alberto Del Rio vs Batista: a head scratcher of who would win. Yeah right, Boretista won with the Boretista Bomb.The Shield vs the Wyatt's: another solid Wyatt match. Wyatt's won when Roman Reigns was left alone with all 3 Wyatt's. Roman broke out of Sister Abrigal once but Bray eventually hit it on him for the win.This is supposed to be Bray Wyatt's year but doubt it if he's versing Mr. Kick Out at 2, John Cena at WM. And no way will Cena lose 3 ppvs in a row. He'll make Bray look weak, like he does with anyone with potential.The Chamber: Christian eliminated Sheamus, Cena kicked out of many signature and finisher moves and did the 5 Knuckle Shuffle 2 times to many boos. So to me Cena just shouldn't have been in the match. Cesaro impressed many when he took on Cena on Raw. So was rewarded by getting to tap to Cena's weak STF.Bryan eliminated Christian with a running knee. Cena stopped stinking up the match when the Wyatt's caused him to get pinned by Orton. Bryan should have won but Kane was out to check on Cena, so of course Kane caused Bryan to get 2 RKO's and that was it for him. Brock never came out. So Orton vs Batista will officially stink up WM.I can't think of any good match Orton and Batista have ever had, especially one WM worthy. Lesnar vs Batista would make a bigger fresher match.

1603005,"This televised movie starts out with a fury of action only be misdirected to two days earlier.  Why so many filmmakers employ this gambit is beyond me.  Nothing irritates me more than to become absorbed in something only to have it abruptly halt so the story can take a step or two behind to the time leading up to the crisis.  And then they repeat the crisis.  The only difference in this case is the involvement of space, time, continuum, something or other, that allows one of the characters to talk to herself long enough to give herself some of the solution to their problem: stopping a volcano eruption like none other (aren't they all), that will shove us into the dark ages.  At any rate, it's a paradox.  Besides the problem of averting disaster, there's also a pseudo relationship between the brainy scientist (Juliet Aubrey) and ranger Charlie (Richard Burgi).  They bicker and snipe at each other, which, as anyone knows, is the perfect formula for romance (a happy marriage would be quite another matter).  Aubrey is a British actress who has appeared in such shows as, Midsomer Murders, Dalziel and Pascoe, Primeval, Vera, and Inspector Lewis.  Why she thought this movie would be a step up for her career is anyone's guess.  Richard Burgi usually takes what he can get.I have to say that I'm a sucker for films about volcanoes (good or bad).  This one is neither better nor worse than most.  It has the usual implausible plot, the FX is adequate but not altogether convincing, the characters are pretty standard; as entertainment goes, it does the job it's supposed to.  I found that I enjoyed it enough to put it into my collection for future viewings.  It will pair nicely with other disaster flicks of the same type.",N/A
1424230,"The power of music has an almost magical ability.  It transports us to a time and place where we first fell in love with a certain song, band or a piece of the lyrics.  In this aptly titled movie, ""The Music Never Stopped"", for Gabriel Sawyer (Lou Taylor Pucci -'The Story of Luke') it never did.  Directed by Jim Kohlberg from the screenplay by Gwyn Lurie and Gary Marks which was adapted from the short essay, ""The Last Hippie"", by Oliver Sacks MD.  We see gentle and nuanced performances by each of the cast that were able to tug at even the hardest of hearts.  The joy, hardships, and life experiences are all well shown by Kohlberg along with an original soundtrack (Paul Cantelon) that easily allows us to feel what Gabriel understood at the time.  The story's music centers between about 1965 through 1970, with songs featured by; 'The Grateful Dead', 'CSNY', 'Cream', 'The Beatles' and 'Bob Dylan', just to name a few from this beautifully powerful and feeling score.Being a product of the times, the protest of the war in Vietnam, avoiding a collegiate life in favor of playing music, Gabriel is caught up in this scene and in between his parents' wishes for him.  Not being able to handle the seemingly strict way his father, Henry (J.K. Simmons), wishes he would 'shape up his life' and his mother, Helen's (Cara Seymour), compliance to his father, he runs off to Greenwich Village and not seeing his family for two decades. Then the parents get that dreaded phone call.Their son is in the hospital with a huge benign tumor in his brain that is so large from neglecting his health, that it needs to be excised.  It renders Gabriel unable to make new memories, only to think he is still living within the time period of the music he loves.  Gabriel's recall is so poor that he does not remember a conversation once it is concluded.  He must begin to work with a music therapist, Dianne Daley (Julia Ormond, in a wonderfully understated role).  With daily work, she is able to find the place within the music to get into the space where Gabriel can come out of his catatonic type state and begin to open up, become talkative and animated, connecting to the songs he loves.Based on a true story, the movie is a beautiful testament to a father who never gives up and his son whom he loves.  The ways in which they all work together on Gabe's memory recall is fascinating.  The special features offer some information from Dr. Oliver Sacks which aids in how the mind snaps onto musical memory and its importance in making new long-term memories attached to music.  It helps explain how Gabriel can uniquely relate to someone by the music he knows.  His memory holds him at this time as he hasn't progressed passed this point of his life because of the damage to his brain.  Done with love and finesse, the story shows just how important it is when a person first falls in love with the music of a certain generation.  Your memory of the time does not get erased, only reinvigorated with guidance, but with Gabriel, it is downright effervescent.",The Music Never Stopped

1693375,"This is the Canadian TV, Mini Series that will inevitably draw comparisons to the UK's `Queer as Folk'. It tells the quite `explosive' lives of a group on Montrealers but mainly with a gay context. Mathieu is a photographer who has been sowing some wild oats after splitting with long term partner Ian; but then he turns up on the scene again after being the victim of a homophobic attack. We also have Gen who is married to Olivier, she is a doctor and he is a cop and he is also sleeping with his wife's work colleague Hugo.Then we have street kid and AIDS carrier Teo who lesbian Caroline - a social worker- is trying to save. She also wants to have a baby with her lover. We also have a transsexual Mexican lady who steals every scene  she is in - there is a lot crammed in here; I feel like saying the old `SOAP' phrase - `confused? You will be!' etc.  There are scenes of a sexual nature but nothing too full on and some drug taking and some violence, but actually it is all done quite tastefully.The only real issue is that this is twelve episodes and they last about twelve to fifteen minutes each, so these are very bite sized indeed. Whilst the makers cram as much drama as possible into each segment it can get frustrating as soon as you get hooked the ruddy thing goes and ends and you have to press the scene skip to get to the next episode. Still I found it very gripping and watched the whole lot in one go. This would make a brilliant film and if they are going to make more - which I hope they will- then please be brave enough to make longer versions as I think the quality of the programme deserves it, in French, English and a smattering of Spanish with OK to average sub titles - this is really quite good.",Coming Out: Season 1

Voight is believable both as a boxer and as a well-intentioned screw-up of a dad, and Schroder is a fine young actor (and irresistibly adorable), especially since its a custody battle that ends up costing a parents life in the long run where everybody becomes a loser.This flick takes me back to memory lane to when I was 6 years old in the 1st grade during its theatrical release in the Spring of 1979 and when I saw it for the very first time on HBO in the Summer of 1980 and it made me and my mother cry.",N/A

The animation of the characters is good but the combination of the excellent CGI of the tanks themselves makes it stand out. The story line is relatively simple featuring a reluctant commander who has to bring a collection of girls into the world of tankery. The characters and script are quite compelling keeping tension across the episodes with enough cliff hangers for a club of mountaineers. It kept me gripped and fascinated to see how the story ends with no slowing down or wasted episodes. A truly heartwarming experience.Just one sour note though.

656598,"So, I did the dumb thing and read the short story just before watching the movie, so take that into account when reading this review.The movie itself was watchable, if a little disjointed and somewhat hard to follow, but saying that it's based on Kings story is more of a cruel joke than an accurate description.Two characters in the book made it into the movie, but since they were the only two chacters in the book (the writer and the hotel manager), it would have been impossible to leave them out.  Apart from that, I counted 3 vague references to the book.  3.The film makers added several chacters, presumably for us to hate.  The ex-wife made me want to punch her in the face within 2 minutes of being on screen.  When your ex calls you, obviously freaking out and tells you to call the police and save his life, you don't start whining about how he didn't call you when he got into town.  She was begging to be hated, which seems to be the only reason she was in the movie - because trying to build a background for the writer failed miserably.Then starts this whole thing where the room tries to convince him he seeing his dead daughter, and he starts to lose it.  again, adding characters to the story that weren't needed.I'm just disgusted with this movie.  The book made the room a truely malevolent entity.  The movie made it a kinda creepy and surreal place to be, it was so watered down if I didn't know it was based on the book I never would have recognised it.  The stupid film didn't even get the pictures on the wall right!!!!Things that really pissed me off because it wasn't supposed to happen: He left the room (at least he thought he did), he interacted with other people while in the room, he was able to contact people outside the room, he crawled around the freakinig vents and found a dusty corpse that of course (in crappy, predictable movie fashion) came to life and chased him through the ducts, the list could go on for as long as the movie, which seemed endless.Honestly, it was such a struggle to watch the last half hour, I didn't think I would get through it, but I had to see how much more the film makers could screw up the story - and on that point they take the cake, all of the cake, even the crumbs.Then the writer dies at the end, which wasn't supposed to happen, and the story was much more disturbing knowing that for the rest of his life he had to sleep with the lights on so when he woke from his nightmares he instantly knew he was not in that room any more.John Cusack delivers an amazing performance, and is really the reason to watch this movie, the only reason.  He is believable, genuine, and with all the other things I hated about this film, I still found him compelling.Sam Jackson was good as well, but his character was poorly written and in no way resembled a hotel manager.Conclusion:  Skip the movie and read the story.  (Don't worry, America, it's a short story)",1408

Sadly, this movie should have stayed a book.Pathetic special effects looked worse than anything Face Off contestants might inadvertently create.

To make matters worse, I found 2001 to be perhaps the most boring film ever made; completely without plot and a total bore.  Kubrick, his high IQ notwithstanding, is a master of the obvious, and like the long, slow, boring, meaningless theme piece for 2001, the movie exemplifies how people can be lead to believe almost anything has meaning, once you've developed a strong cult following.

1686963,"My husband thought this movie was hilarious, I thought this movie was trash. We do not have the same taste in movies. If you like movies about orgies, constant drug ingestion and following a bunch of Wall-Street sales hustlers who follow Jordan Belfort (the Wolf) around like a bunch of moronic, juvenile, seal-clapping sheep (with no opinions or thoughts of their own) that constantly party and shout in a state of debauchery, depravity and disgust, then this movie is for you.I was immediately offended in the opening scene and thought, oh no, it's going to be more of the same, which it was. Leonardo DiCaprio has certainly crashed from his strong, sentimental hero role in the Titanic to this role, which will only make you think less of him. I kept hoping he would be caught, but Belfort keeps resurfacing over and over in his pursuit of the almighty buck throughout the movie. The character, his friends and his wife were so greedy and superficial that you spend your time hoping he gets punishment but he never really did. Exploiting others for money and it's too bad, that this expensive movie was made for it will only lead to Jordan's Belfort ideas of himself of more self-aggrandizement.I watched Pierce Morgan's interview of him and you can see that all he did, he thought was just highly amusing, which it was not. I watched him, and after this watching this movie, I will now steer clear of financial investors if they are like this narcissistic person who you know, only wrote the book for the money and the power and the fame. The only part of this movie that did make me laugh was when he overdosed on qualudes and was driving his Lamborghini home from the country club. Then that turned gruesome when his best friend almost died choking on a hot dog.Shame on you, Martin Scorsese for spending so much money and time and energy directing this awful movie and I am glad it did not win any Academy Awards, as it did not deserve any. As far as Jordan Belfort, I do hope someone stops you (he does play a cameo of himself at the end of the movie presenting DiCaprio directing a sales presentation). Obviously, you are a person of no morals and you haven't learned any.One last thing, if you like hearing the ""f"" word over and over and over, then you will like this movie. Raunchy, the height of vulgarity, obscene and immature, and just downright stupid, besides the pointless sex scenes, this movie left a strong distaste for me of all the hackers that are out there trying to sell you something. (This could have been about Bernie Madoff.) Glad the Academy Awards passed this one by too.

I can't really understand the backlash in some other reviews.  True or false?  You can accept German characters screaming at each other in Italian, with orchestral accompaniment, with no orchestra visible--in fact in a room not large enough to hold an orchestra.  Then what's so shocking about one more literary layer, the thinking arias, especially when it makes perfect sense in context of the drama, and the medium?Of course, I would consider the thinking arias concept a gimmick 'owned' by this production alone and would not want to see it become a standard technique, which of course it hasn't.In any case I would definitely suggest this is the de facto 'benchmark' version of Nozze di Figaro on video, much as I'm sure most would agree the Giulini set is the definitive version on audio.

1576634,"Wow, when I originally read reviews for this movie I really had high hopes. I am a big fan of giallo movies and euro-horror. I love Bava, Argento, Fulci and Franco and have seen many of the key recommended giallo films of the 70s. This is none of it. It doesn't even work on a reconstructed, subverted or meta level - because NOTHING happens in the movie. There is no central mystery to solve, there are no murders, there is no conspiracy. Midway thru when you are CRAVING some type of plot point or scene which would propel the narrative or give you a clue as to where the movie is taking you - you ask yourself, &#34;Is this just about Toby Jones slowing losing his mind?&#34; AND IT IS. Although you don't particularly have a clue as to why he's losing it. And him cracking up never leads to any kind of explosion of violence, denouement or cathartic release for the audience. There is a trying too hard to be clever &#34;switch&#34; one hour into the movie to lend it some kind of credibility by trying to put it in the company of Mulholland Drive, Persona or 3 women. But there is no underlying logic to it. What this movie has going for it is sound design and cinematography. But that was completely exhausted in the first 40 minutes. If you want to see another hour and 10 minutes of Toby Jones sliding faders and turning knobs or an actress screaming in a booth for the 10th time - be my guest. Tedious, repetitious and decidedly NOT a tribute to giallo (other than a sly tangental referencing of Suspiria in the movie that is being made within the film). It's a boring indie psychodrama masquerading as an arthouse &#34;horror&#34; movie. If you want to see an abstract arthouse tribute to giallo then rent &#34;AMER,&#34; a strange, stylish exercise in italian thriller subversion. (Although it has flaws, too!) Last thing, there is not one character to empathize or identify with in the movie. Every character is pretty much unlikeable.",Berberian Sound Studio

1614403,"Now, how to rate these Iphigeniae?  Normally I detest modernized productions, but these seem to work ... in a way.  Perhaps because they are mostly talky operas, with not much action, an alternate setting seems a little more palatable.  And ""alternate"" is probably the key word here--it is far more an alternate setting than a modernized one.  In fact, it's almost Dali-esque.  And I will go ahead and say it.  The alternate setting lets one focus on the psychological drama, rather than on the togas and columns etc.  (That all said, I still would not want to be without the traditional 2002 video from Muti/La Scala.)The worst thing here is not the non-traditional stage setting, it's the poorly-engineered subtitles.  Like so many blu-rays, the subtitles are tiny and hard to read.  Especially, being white subtitles, when they're shown against a white background.  Why does not someone think of these things when they're planning their professional designs?Musically and vocally, the production is beyond reproach.  However, we have to include the video element in the review.  Otherwise, what's the point of having a video?  Four stars is generous considering everything.  I suppose I am in a generous mood on Gluck's birthday.  Now if only every day could be Gluck's birthday :)To enjoy these operas, be sure you do your homework in advance.  You must know the entire story from beginning to end before starting the opera.  Even if the subtitles were legible, they wouldn't give you the arc of the story in these particular operas--and that would hold true regardless of production or era of setting.  Know the story in advance and then the viewing and listening experience will be most rewarding.",Gluck: IphigÃ©nie en Aulide / IphigÃ©nie en Tauride

1670369,"Discounting the couple in the opening scene, this 80-some-odd minute movie takes (literally) 40 minutes to really start picking up steam. It's all backstory and character building, but we get it all ready- the main character is blind and insists on being independent. She does a pretty good job of it, too, with some minor struggles. It could have all been conveyed and explained in half the time or less.But once it gets going (finally), it's pretty good. Some things are bit predictable, but the slasher-stalking-blind-girl twist is something new to me. I didn't know how I'd feel about that, when we, the audience, can SEE the threat but she can't. It worked, in general, and much to my surprise. One part in particular was applause-worthy for shock value and creativity.The lead in this movie is phenomenal. She exceeded my expectations.There are the expected blood and violence in this movie, of course, but it's not over-the-top. This one does not try to hide behind shocking violence and excessive gore to carry it.I would have enjoyed a little more as to the 'why' besides 'It's Mischief Night', especially when the slasher apparently has taken to attacking the same house at least two years in a row. Really? Kind of lame, especially when there's no explanation offered.A decent movie IF you have the patience to get past the lengthy set-up in the first half of the movie. And, of course, it never hurts when Richard Riehle (a.k.a 'Tom' in Office Space, the 'Jump to Conclusions' matt guy) shows up for a moment or two.

Sigourney Weaver's character wasn't given any depth. She was simply the comic evil-step-sister-type. Everyone in Griffiths' characters life was shown to be detrimental to her desire to rise above her station in life and succeed, except, of course her prince charming--Harrison Ford's character. I know it sounds as though I am panning the film. I'm not. It's pleasant escapism in a romantic comedy; just don't look for any depth and enjoy the happy ending.",N/A

1327387,"EVERYTHING about this movie was terrific! All of the acting was nice, the script was well done for such a complicated concept.  I enjoyed the Ashton Kutcher old movie actually called ""The Butterfly Effect"" but it used the concept as a more simple plot device...though explaining it.  This actually walked you through it. And looking at Jared for that long was great, the younger actor they picked was a good choice too.  I wish the photo they used for the cover didn't make it look like a mad scientist movie.  They have him in a picture looking like mel brooks...or is it Gibson?  I almost didn't pick this on my Prime to watch!!! Lucky me!  Might be too confusing for teens but if you explain the ""Butterfly Effect"" they might get it's relationship to choices...though I'm not sure it was very clear in explaining. No matter the choice it always moves us forward in time in our reality.I thought the end was super creepy.  Imagine that being your life at the End...or was it?  Is it ever? or is it all a matter of perception as they suggest when the baby is born. Lots to think about.  I wrote a few of the ideas in my journal to think about, but it was clear early on, that there were so many interesting Ideas that I need to buy the movie.Jared NEVER ages!

1634276,"....not good at all....&#34;In the heat of the night&#34;was a very successful movie in which a homicide detective from the north(Sidney Potrtier)is stranded in the deep south in a town called Sparta on the night of the murder of a rich white man.The bigoted police chief(Rod Steiger)at first suspects the detective,Virgil Tibbs of being the killer,based mainly on his race but then uses his expertise to solve the crime.The film was a gritty portrayal of bigoted attitudes that ultimately lead to a grudging mutual respect between the two main charectersSteiger won the Oscar for his portrayal of the policeman Gillispe..The t.v.show toned down all of the grit and realism,making Gillispie a sort of loveable curmudgeon with slightly politically incorrect racial viewpoints,while Tibbs,whose anger at the prejudice he experienced in the original film version was palpable was recast as a forgive and forget sort of a guy who just happens to accept a job working with Gillispie...Where the original film was on fire the t.v.show was just an ember...Still,once one got past all of the watering down the show succeeded as a typical 1980s police drama...Nothing really weighty or controversial,just the facts,the usual suspects,stock charecters played rather broadly.The 8th and&#34;final&#34;season was 4 really bad made-for t.v-movies,none of which had satisfactory conclusions.Gillispie the bigot has married a black politician,something the original film version Gillispie would never have done.Indeed,by the 8th season Gillispie may well have been a member of the N.A.A.C/P.given his 180degree makeover.Tibbs was long gone,the Sparta police department was happily integrated under a new police chief who was African-American,and Gillispie was sheriff of an equally happily integrated sheriff's department.So much for 1980s reality.The films present crimes and criminals but for the most part there are no conclusions to these tales.In &#34;By duty bound&#34;Gillispie is about to retire.A corrupt but popular businessman intends to take his place.Three murders take place.A suspect is arrested.END OF FILM.In&#34;Grow old along with me'an ex-policeman with a dark secret weds the local rich widow.A woman from the policeman's past emerges and threatens to spill the beans.The ex-cop and his new bride plan to murder her but their plans go very wrong and two innocent teens are killed instead.The couple is blackmailed.The ex-cop kills himself.END OF FILM.No conclusions.No wonder the show folded after this dismal last season.Sure,in real life there often are no satisfactory conclusions but given all of the re-tooling the show underwent in its transformation from film to television,and the 7 seasons in which each episode did have a conclusion these final 4 films are jarring to say the very least.",In The Heat of the Night: Complete Season 8

I am more interested in having a great story than preserving some narrow interpretation of the Batman and this movie delivers an epic that is both refreshing and familiar.I won't go over any plot details as you should experience it for yourself without predisposition, but suffice it to say, this is a darker, grittier, and, in some ways, more realistic portrayal of the Batman.  A common motif among the franchise is how Batman is a symbol for Gotham City and, albeit, not necessary a pleasant one.  This Batman both terrifies and inspires and it is this sophisticated dichotomy that gives such richness to the character.Further, they say art imitates life and this story includes some references to real life politics and social issues.  These aren't frivolous references that are casually tossed in.  Rather, they are meant to give realism and credibility to the movie by providing a cultural backdrop we can all understand and relate to.This film is truly a work of art.",DCU:Batman: Dark Knight Returns P2 (DVD)

295998,"In the seventies and early eighties, a sub-genre of the action exploitation market was the revenge thriller. In mainstream movies, the Death Wish franchise which kicked off so strongly in 1974 kept Charles Bronson seeking vigilante style justice for almost two decades (with less and less payoff for its audience). And underground filmmakers also found a natural niche in these violent endeavors. One of the most notorious pictures of the era was 1978's ""I Spit on Your Grave,"" where a woman strikes back against those who have violated her. These are but a few of the many highlights of the genre, and both were significant precursors and influences for director Abel Ferrara's similarly themed ""Ms. 45."" From 1981, this movie may be less well known than some of the bigger titles, but it still stands as an interesting example of vigilante excess. A new DVD/Blu-ray label, Drafthouse Films, is giving us a second look at this somewhat forgotten film and offers us quite a few extras including interviews and featurettes.The heroine of ""Ms. 45"" is a mute young woman working in New York's fashion district. So unprepossessing and retiring, she barely makes an impact at all as the movie begins. Of course, the screenplay makes the streets of New York very mean indeed with over-the-top scenarios that have virtually every woman mauled any time she steps out into public. Trust me, there's nothing subtle here. Early on, the young seamstress named Thana (well played by Zo Lund) is brutally attacked not just once, but twice in about fifteen minutes. I told you these were mean streets! As she lashes out in self-defense, it will forever change the course of her life. She finds a new sense of purpose and female empowerment as she takes back the night from the criminal element using a trusty 45 caliber gun. But as Thana enjoys a newfound confidence, it also comes at a cost. Will her lust for blood against the men who have wronged women everywhere push her over the edge? As Thana is mute, we see the subtle (and some more obvious) shifts in her demeanor and this character evolution is what makes ""Ms. 45"" stand out. Is Thana growing stronger or simply slipping into insanity? It's a fine line and an interesting point to pursue.I won't reveal any more about ""Ms. 45,"" but the movie is also assisted by Ferrara's unique visual flourish, a propulsive soundtrack, and Lund's adept performance. This was an early effort for Ferrara's who went on to do some great movies (Bad Lieutenant) as well as some painfully obtuse ones (4:44 Last Day on Earth). Here, he takes advantage of the expectations within the low budget exploitation genre and tweaks them with subversive glee. ""Ms. 45,"" though, is certainly a product of its time. It is both garish and over-the-top, but it does work with its modest goals. As Lund transforms, the movie (though not perfect or polished) is hard to look away from and, in my estimation, that is what makes it worth a viewing for those with an interest in this type of filmmaking.

1021248,"I've discovered in the very recent years the popularity of classic novels being adapted to extended TV presentations.  This has been going on for a long time, but I've arrived late to the party.  The online reviews such as are here on amazon are helpful to me when deciding which version to purchase first.  I went with the older Timothy Dalton production, and I like it very much.  I try to read the novels just before watching, just to have the written story fresh in my mind.  I have the patience for the longer, more complete productions.  That older title is very faithful to all stages of Jane Eyre's life story, and devotes film time to her childhood ""abuse"" before she grows up and takes command of her life.I next decided to try this newer production (Ruth Wilson as Jane), based on generally popular approval in reviews.  I agree with them.  I very much enjoyed it, and in most ways now prefer it over the earlier version I mentioned above.  Very little time is devoted to Jane's school girl story.  I think that time is important to understanding her character, and I wish there was more of it included in the film.  But I agree that the essential story is the romantic relationship between Jane (the governess) and Rochester (the employer/mystery).  And the romance is convincing in this version.  The actors are appealing physically, and they seem to have a real chemistry.  Neither are exactly beautiful, yet both are imperfectly beautiful.There's so much to the story, in novel form, that it isn't practical to expect it all to be included in this film.  The gothic mystery, with the secret in the tower room, is certainly represented with some significance.  But it seemed to me to slightly minimized in comparison to the book, or the Dalton mini-series.  I liked the way the gypsy woman scene was adapted this time.  It's more believable than the novel.  No man in woman's costume this time.  The quiet devastation of the marriage altar scene is well done.  The actress Wilson is convincing with her silence.  And when she does break down into tears, both in her scene with Rochester when he's about to propose, and when she's alone in her room with her wedding clothes, it's very moving.The book tests your endurance by taking Jane to a completely new location, with new characters, in the final section when she flees Thornfield Hall.  Here she starts over, and has time to reflect on the disappointment.  This film does include this period, and generally I like the way it's done.  I like the character St. John as it's written and acted.  In the book, I was always slightly impatient with him.  We're supposed to like his two sisters, and it's easy to like them.  In this film, I like them very much.  I wish more time could have been devoted to them here.  They were very important to Jane (book) and they make you feel good about people generally.  The inheritance story line wasn't emphasized as strongly as I would have liked, but it's there.  I like the way they included the local girl for St. John.  She generates my sympathy.The final reunion is satisfying.  Some parts are written differently, and it moves pretty quickly.  But the couple's love is well represented, as well as the sense of reconstructed family love.  As a film, standing alone from any famous novel, I thought it was very well done...very satisfying.",N/A

1537072,"This is one of my favorite black and white movies and unlike most Westerns, it revolves mainly around women who are traveling West to California to become brides to the men who have sent for wives. These women had it rough, and the movie convincingly portrays what it was like to go by wagon train for months at a time facing everything from floods, to Indians, to lack of water and snakes just to name a few, all for the opportunity to marry a stranger.  They start off with a group of men to help them on the trip, but when things get out of hand and trail boss Robert Taylor (one of the old handsome Hollywood actors of days gone by) makes it clear the women are off limits, the majority of the men leave so things get even tougher for these women.  There is humor, action, fights and friendships among the women and by the time they finally get there, you're as anxious as they are to see the men they've traveled all that way to meet.  It was a rough life, I'm not sure I could have done it, but it makes for a great Saturday afternoon of movie viewing and had me thinking how glad I am to have a car!",N/A

153491,"Growing up in NYC and graduating in 1985 makes me biased when it comes to Beat Street which cannot be touched in regards of vintage hip hop culture. I attended Andrew Jackson High school and Todd Smith AKA LL Cool J was one of my classmates. Run from Run DMC also graduated from AJ. The legendary Jam Master J attended P.S.  147 with me and was 2 years ahead. That's just a fraction of the talent that I grew up with. Beat street came out when hip hop was just more of an art than the nonsense you hear today. The East Coast was quite different from the West coast and we took pride in the gold nameplates, Lee jeans and Adidas, Kangol hats etc. Beat Street for those who were not a part of that era is REAL. This story happened countless times in Brooklyn. Queens, The Bronx, and Uptown. This was years before East and West coast had idiotic beefs and people were killed. We were proud of being New Yorkers and that was our focus. Beat street is 100 percent authentic and we saw ourselves in that movie. Every character was someone with whom you could relate to. The best part of it all for me is that I went to countless concerts and basement jams seeing the likes of all the performers in Beat Street. Going to the Bronx with my crew all wearing our football jackets and going down a dungy basement filled with teenage boys and girls. Going to Harlem World seeing the pioneer Cool Herc making sure everything is in check. I can never get tired of watching this movie because I was there was not a better time or place to have gone to high school. As a healthy 46 year old I watch this movie and it takes me back to a time that was just.......better.",Beat Street VHS

However the trailer was so enticing I felt a pull and enlisted hubby's help (he first came to this country carrying a guitar on his back).Based on the life of Rich Mullins, this is one of the most arresting movies of faith, love and charity I have seen to date.Rich Mullins was a successful Contemporary Christian musician, known to Christians as the writer/singer of the worship anthem &#8220;Awesome God&#34;.Influenced by St Francis of Assisi, Rich Mullins was a speaker on the power of God's love and the need for redemption, lived his faith every day of his life whilst facing his many demons.Rising to the top of his profession, he eventually walked away from the pressures and lived on a Navajo reservation until his death in 1997.I was however more interested in the actual person than the depressing portrayal presented by Michael Koch in RAGAMUFFIN.Despite his struggles with substances and his bouts with despondency, Rich Mullins appeared to be someone you could not ignore. His vibrant personality made you think of your own faith and reminds us that we all come to God as ragamuffins.This is one time where I would like to urge readers not to miss the special features, a must to understand the message. And speaking about the message behind the movie, Ragamuffin is certain to appeal to youths.An excellent conversation opener, the movie of one man's struggle to live an honest faith in a materialist's society is well worth 4 stars!Disclaimer:  I received a copy of this DVD from FLYBY Promotions.

1583574,"I have been watching CSI for seven years. I will still consider it one of my favorite shows of all time. Some fans thought the show was going to go downhill in season 9 when William Peterson left, and surprisingly, it didn't. Laurence Fishburne made a surprisingly good lead, and some of my favorite episodes actually come from season 11 (which also had that awesome cameo from Peterson). So, what happened?Season 12 saw the departure of Fishburne, and Ted Danson came in as the new lead. I thought Danson was a good new addition to the cast, and I will say that season 12 was good, just not as good as season 11. My hope was that season 12 would be just like season 10; a good season, but the show was still trying to find it's footing. Season 10 was good, but it was still awkward without Peterson, and the writing wasn't all that top notch. Season 11, however, really stepped up it's game and did a terrific job utilizing Fishburne as it's lead. I hoped that season 13 would also step up it's game and take more advantage of it's new cast members.Unfortunately, None of the new or old characters are developed. If you didn't care for characters like Finn or Brody, this season doesn't help. They get more screen time, but they aren't developed and you still don't get much backstory from them (they're acting hasn't improved that much either). They come off as more annoying as ever. But, what really killed this season for me, was the episode &#34;Forget me not&#34;, which seriously jumped the shark. If you don't want to be spoiled, then stop reading this review.*SPOILERS!*Sara and Grisom are now divorced. Yep, nine years were spent developing this relationship. Now, it's meaningless. Imagine if &#34;Friends&#34; was renewed for an 11th season, and Rachael decided to go to Paris after all. Talk about a slap in the face to fans of those characters. This was the moment in CSI that they ran out of ideas for drama, and they decided &#34;hey, how about Sara gets divorced?&#34; BRILLIANT! One problem: She's married to one of the most beloved characters on the show, who isn't even here anymore. I know the human drama isn't the focus of the show but... oh wait, yes it is! What made this show stand out was it's characters, and why it's been around for all of these years. I know not every character is going to get a happy ending, but we invested nine years in the relationship of these characters. Splitting up Sara and Grisom made me consider everything post season 12 of CSI is non canon.Like I said, I know other fans will write this off and say &#34;eh, I just watch the show for the crime solving&#34;. But this season, the forensics side of it is pushed too far to the background. The mysteries this season are too predictable and too convoluted (even for CSI standards). The human drama that used to make this show so great is now the equivalent of a bad soap opera. If you're a fan of this show, I'd say just watch up to season 12, then the season 13 premiere, which works as a nice little finale. There really isn't anything worth watching after that. I wasn't one of the fans that gave up on this show after Peterson left. I'm glad I continued to watch, but now, it's time to stop. I'm not going to act like this season is terrible (there are a few mildly entertaining episodes here and there) but it's not the same CSI.",CSI: Crime Scene Investigation - Season 13

The only one that struck my fancy that particular day was A Haunting at Silver Falls, so I settled in to watch, hoping against hope that this would be one of those rare birds where the public was entirely wrong and this was an overlooked gem. It's not&#8212;there's a little too much &#8220;you really expected me to suspend that much disbelief?&#8221; in the final third of this debut script&#8212;but it's better than I expected given its position at the low end of that particular totem pole.Plot: Jordan (The Bling Ring's Alix Elizabeth Gitter) is a newly-orphaned teen who's been packed off to live with her aunt and uncle, Kevin (X2's Steve Bacic) and Anne (My Best Friend's Wife's Tara Westwood) Sanders. Not long after she arrives at the new homestead, she starts seeing things&#8212;things that turn out (this isn't a spoiler given the cover art) to be the ghosts of a pair of local twins (Gamer's Jade and Nikita Ramsey) whose father is about to be executed for their murder.

And, perhaps more importantly, are they going to get in the way of a possible romance with local nerd Larry (Mansion of Blood's James Cavlo in his feature debut)?Donowho (5 Souls) and a trio of writers all turning in their first script do a competent job. It's not great, and it's certainly not subtle, but it's watchable enough to spend a quick hour and a half with. The Big Reveal is bats enough that you're either going to love it or hate it.

1513270,"""Babe"" is one of the most original and heartwarming movies ever made,  It is the story of a pig (Babe) who, by way of a carnival raffle, ends up on a farm owned by Arthur Hoggett and his wife Esme.  The pig's fate, from the outset, is surely to be the main course for the upcoming Christmas supper,  but fate sometimes takes an unexpected turn ... and so it is with Babe's.As the story unfolds, Babe's innocence and good intentions win over the other animals on the farm (all the animals can talk).  He becomes friends with ""Ferdinand"" (a duck that wants to be a rooster), ""Ma"" (the elder ""matriarch"" sheep of the large sheet herd on the farm), and ""Fly"" (one of two sheepdogs on the farm).  Fly, in particular, shows great kindness toward Babe, and Babe responds by ... wanting to be a sheepdog.  Farmer Hoggett notices this, and he gives Babe a chance.  His wife, his daughter, and his son-in-law all think Arthur is crazy ... and they laugh at him ... but Farmer Hoggett gradually becomes convinced that Babe is a special sheep-herding animal ... and he enters his pig in the National Sheepdog Trials (competition) ... without his wife's knowledge and without telling the competition's officials that his ""entry"" is a pig.The scene at the competition is believably ... very believably ... chaotic, as Arthur has to persevere through the disapproval of the officials and the raucous laughter of the crowd ... to get Babe out onto the sheep herding course.  Mrs. Hoggett is watching too ... in horror and disbelief ... on a TV in a hotel room.  Her reactions to the embarrassment her husband is causing are priceless.  But Babe come through (in the competition) and everybody watching is reduced to silence.  It is a wonderful wonderful ending.Based on the book ""The Sheep-Pig"" by children's author Dick King-Smith, the screenplay for ""Babe"" is superbly crafted to be realistic and believable (given the fanciful nature of the story) ... and fun.  The narration, which is like a caring tour guide throughout the movie, carries the audience through this emotionally touching story using the most concise and easy-to-understand sentences possible.  The voice performers (for the animal voices) were well cast and they do an excellent job.  The live actors too are excellent.  James Cromwell is wonderful as the sparing-of-words Farmer Hoggett.  His acting style is realistic, understated, precise, and ... effective.  Magda Szubanski who plays the pretentious and bossy Mrs. Hoggett, makes her character funny and non-threatening.But it is the message that the movie gives that is perhaps its most endearing quality. ""Never give up on your dreams ... even if they are unconventional.""  ""Babe"" is a wonderfully unconventional movie.  It makes me wish there were more like it.",N/A

It is somewhat of a benchmark to understand the depth of what she brings to her later works. Its also a taste of the gothic and romantic adventure novels she grew up on.

1590391,"A common criticism of BEAUTIFUL CREATURES is that it doesn't do justice to the original novel, which is often the case when the book is really good. I had not read the book prior to watching this but am now eager to do so.Regardless, BEAUTIFUL CREATURES is vividly filmed with good performances by Alice Englert, Alden Ehrenreich, Emmy Rossum, Rachel Brosnahan, and just about everyone else. Another frequent complaint seems to be that there is not enough in the magic/special effects department: True, but the relative sparseness here adds a necessary realism and highlights what spectactics the film does have. The townspeople of Gatlin, South Carolina, are stereotypical Bible-thumping yokel-rubes, but that serves its purpose in the way it contrasts Lena (Englert), who is just about the only character who does not speak in a deep-southern accent. It also helps in how Ethan (Ehrenreich) and his buddy Link (Thomas Mann) completely defy their hickish appearances. BEAUTIFUL CREATURES captures the whole Southern Gothic tradition quite well. One way or another, the relationships in this film are very real. BEAUTIFUL CREATURES also walks the thin horror-comedy line most admirably.On the dimmer end of things, the whole texture of the film is a little slow and murky, and it would probably have been a little better with a few minutes cut here and there.",N/A

660412,"Great 50's low budget sci-fi film.  Appears to be the inspiration for Alien.  An astronaut, stranded on Mars in his wrecked spaceship, gets picked up by a rescue mission and promptly accused of murdering his fellow 'nauts.  He is later vindicated when the real killer, a vicious, deadly Martian life form stows aboard the rescue vessel and starts diminishing the crew.  Great tension.  The acting is OK, the monster suit is best seen in shadows and the sets and effects for the most part are only so-so.  This is obviously a 50's film because of the subservient role the women take.  Still, other than all that it is an entertaining film.  Two things struck me the most.  First, the rescue commander's animosity toward his prisoner.  It seemed very personal, like he resented that THIS guy was selected for the first mission instead of himself.  Second, the opening shot of the Martian landscape.  It was excellent, very eerie and seemed like not a place you want to find yourself alone in.  The Midnite Movies DVD release is excellent quality.

414183,"It's November 1959 - and sat at Desk 861 in the towering New York City Central Office of Consolidated Life (the 5th biggest insurance company in the USA) - sits lowly worker C.C. Baxter. Clifford Charles (nicknamed Bud) is up on the 19th floor every day at 08:50 a.m. precisely - monotonously tapping away on his Priden calculating machine like all the other 31,259 employees sat in long lines of square desks behind him. But Bud has a more pressing 'problem' than working out in his brain how far eight million New Yorkers will stretch if laid out side-by-side - access to his Manhattan apartment situated a short distance away from Central Park and near the office...You see Apartment 2A in 51 West 67th Street has become rumpy-pumpy central for a group of managerial types at Consolidated Life. There's Mr. Eichelberger from Mortgage and Loans booked in on Friday, Mr. Kirkeby from Accounts going at it on Thursday and Mr. Vanderhoff from Public Relations having an extra-martial swing on Wednesday. Bluntly there's barely enough room for Mr. Dobisch from Admin come the weekend - nor even space for Switchboard Sylvia partnered with the cheap but suavely dressed Mr. Lieberman on Tuesday.You wouldn't mind if they were gentlemen about it either. &#34;You mean you bring other dames up here! Certainly not! I'm a happily married man!&#34; Lieberman complains as Sylvia asks for cab fare back to the Bronx. Bud has to wait outside his apartment in the cold night air for the two lovebirds to clear off. They said they'd be out by eight - but it's already quarter before nine. &#34;These things don't run to a clock!&#34; he explains to Bud when he has to go back to get Sylvia's galoshes. It's a wonder Bud finds time for a TV dinner, a classic movie on his black and white TV that never seems to arrive because of craftily placed advert breaks (&#34;A word from our sponsors...a word from our alternate sponsors!&#34;) or to clear away the Vermouth bottles and empty Cheese Cracker packets.Worse - on hearing the noises emanating from his bachelor pad - his impressionable Jewish neighbours Dr. and Mrs. Dreyfuss think Bud's a massive playboy - &#34;Mildred! He's at it again!&#34; the Doctor cries out to his wife. So why does Bud put up with it all? Because he's really hoping that all those corporate promises made by randy execs back in the office will help him climb the promotion ladder to maybe 2nd Administrative Assistant. But when he gets locked out of 2A until 4 a.m. one night and develops a fever from sleeping on a Central Park bench - he slowly twigs that his 'loyal, resourceful and co-operative' nature as described in their internal reports is being taken advantage of (dialogue above) - and for $95 a week - it's all starting to become a bit much.The only other human joy Bud gets is from his daily close-proximity meets with the pretty Fran Kubelik (Shirley MacLaine) - a nice respectable girl who operates one of the 16 elevators in the office skyscraper. Bud takes off his hat for her (the only one who does - which she likes) - and on occasion exchanges nervous schmuck talk with her. Fran seems smart and wears a flower in the lapel of her immaculate uniform while fending off the roving hands of managers patting her buttocks as they exit on Floor 27. Then one night Bud musters up the courage to ask Fran out - but she has other plans - a date with Jeff Sheldrake from Personnel (Fred McMurray) - whom his secretary Miss Olsen (Evie Adams) knows is a notorious womanizer and is very, very good at it.And on it goes to a hopeful Christmas party, a disastrous date with two tickets for the comedy show &#34;The Music Man&#34; where she doesn't show and an unintentional personality reveal on her part with a broken vanity mirror that he recognizes to his horror. Will the hapless couple see the error of their ways - will they end up playing gin rummy together in 'their' apartment - in love and free from manipulation and takers...Much like the racy and adventurous &#34;Pillow Talk&#34; from the year previous - &#34;The Apartment&#34; was a staggeringly grown-up movie for 1960. It offered up probing dialogue, genuine wit on the battle of the sexes and awkward truths on relationships in the workplace. It also featured believable yet likeable characters - five womanizing schmucks, a gullible but worthy leading lady and one bungling but sincere klutz who learns the hard way how to be a stand-up guy.The script came to Director Billy Wilder via two places - a viewing of Britain's &#34;Brief Encounter&#34; in the Forties where a married couple use someone else's home in London for an affair - and a notorious Hollywood scandal where it transpired that the mogul charged had been using the apartment of an employee. Wilder then brought in the genius of I.A.L. Diamond to give the harsh script a warmer touch (legend has it that IAL stands for Interscholastic Algebra League which Izzy Diamond won in 1937).They began by toning down everything - the apartment isn't Central Park West lushness colourful with money - it's dowdy and filled with used records, curling art prints on the wall, a lone lamp, an old gas oven and the everyman of Jack Lemmon. Shot in Widescreen Black and White - the tones made the November evenings feel chillier and the massive long office floor look like a monochrome factory where life is not lived but wasted away on paperwork. Even the famous suicide scene where Fran (Shirley MacLaine) tries to off herself with sleeping pills sees the doctor next door (a fantastic Jack Kruschen) violently slap her face, make her walk and force cups of coffee down her throat to stop the stupor from killing her. And the four Office Managers are all ordinary-looking middle-aged men who really should know better - they're not sexy - they're just high on power and kicks. It's not pretty and quite dark in its undertones in places. So - how do you get affection and redemption out of this saucy stew?The answer is the acting talent of Lemmon and MacLaine and a multi-layered script imbibed with pathos and humour to soften the underbelly of seediness. Coming off the huge public and critical acclaim given to &#34;Some Like It Hot&#34; - Jack Lemmon showed what he could do in that classic. But &#34;The Apartment&#34; let him shine - doing comedy, romance and drama - all in the one movie. The leading actress needed to be sexy, ballsy, vulnerable and likeable enough to not be perceived as a sappy victim - and Shirley MacLaine delivered on every front. Their slow dance towards each other is beautifully and realistically handled - while Fred McMurray goes completely against nice-guy type by being a cruel man dressed up in groomed civility - doling out smiling condolences from the other end of a phone where he doesn't haven't to get his actual hands dirty.The picture quality is excellent - and on occasion - gorgeous. The Aspect Ratio is 2.35:1 Widescreen so there are bars top and bottom - but even stretched to Full Screen - it looks great. From the moment the opening credits appear - it's obvious too there's been extensive cleaning and restoration. There is however a very fine shimmer of natural grain throughout that rarely disappears. But when it does - the picture suddenly becomes exceptional - almost noir in its lighting and shades. The scene between McMurray and MacLaine in the Chinese restaurant The Rickshaw where he once again promises to leave his wife for a woman is one such moment - a side profile shot as they talk - and it's just beautiful to look at.The Extras are pleasingly deep. A discussion on the film that includes Nineties interviews with Evie Adams, Shirley MacLaine, Jack Lemmon's son Paul and film experts on Wilder and Diamond. There's also a fabulous commentary by BRUCE BLOCK for the duration of the movie where he gives real details on the actors, the sets and even quotes from Wilder's screenplay to show the accuracy of how scenes were depicted (his description of &#34;The Apartment&#34; itself is filled with exact items he wanted).  It's exemplary stuff. Audio is English 5.1 TS-HD Master Audio, Spanish Mono and French Mono. Subtitles are English for the Hearing Impaired, Spanish and French.&#34;I love you...so completely...&#34; Jack Lemmon says to Shirley MacLaine. Finally contented that she's picked the right guy this time - Fran smiles wryly at Bud - and with that old confidence back in her voice once again says with affection - &#34;Shut up and deal...&#34;A great film rather than a good one - book a night in for a game of emotional Gin Rummy with &#34;The Apartment&#34;.",N/A

Well, this one is visual too BUT its more of an auditory film and none that I can think can even compare. In that regard, this film deserves a lot of credit.  The acting is strong across the board. The lead actor, while familiar to me as an actor, really made me believe his character. The atmosphere was ominous and foreboding, claustrophobic as well.

466132,"Just to see the upper crust dry humor of the late Victorian Era played out in a comedy of manners and potential marital mayhem by a superb cast of Brits who perform the dialogue with brisk and droll delivery as dry as a tin of biscuits left over from that era is worth watching and adoring.  Watching Googie Withers and the incomparable Beatrice Lillie (why oh why didn't she do more films???????) put their two prospective bridegrooms through their thoroughly bred paces is indeed funny.  Clive Brook (who also wound up directing after a false start with another director at the helm...his name escapes me) and Roland Culver, a delightfully amusing fellow indeed, provide the male half of the quartet as they pursue wealth and love from the two ladies who are neither too sure of their prospects suitability.  All of them coming together for a month of trial and error at Bea's Scottish Island Estate.  It is a comedy only the British could do and has rarely if ever been done better.  The attitudes alone will appall modern audiences...but the quick witted asides and oh so veddy been there, done that world weariness of the participants will delight you.  Googie Withers plays an American heiress by the way.  The only yank influence on the proceedings and she acquits herself quite well despite being as British as the other three.  I was tickled all the way home with this one and guffawed more often than I realized til later.

1632014,"In the Eighties, legend has it, the US armed forces hit upon the idea of encouraging Hollywood to make recruitment films for them. Thus, An Officer and a Gentleman, Top Gun, Navy SEALS and Private Benjamin (okay: maybe not Private Benjamin) were bankrolled by Uncle Sam specifically to make the military look glamorous so impressionable minds might sign up. As far as my mates were concerned it had the desired effect. Since we were slap bang in the middle of Nowheresville, South Pacific, they enlisted not for the Top Gun program but as RNZAF cadets and wound up clanking around the Chatham Islands in a forty-year-old Hercules. As far as I know they&#8217;re still doing it now. As a consequence, to this day none of them can abide Val Kilmer. But no matter.Latterly this military recruitment tactic seemed to have fallen out of favour, but it might be back: Ben Affleck&#8217;s new movie Runner Runner plays so moralistically as a lecture against the evils of online gaming you have to wonder whether FBI&#8217;s Cybercrime Fraud folk didn&#8217;t have a stake &#8211; excuse the pun.Subtext: online gaming can corrupt innocent and brilliant minds all too easily.In Runner Runner, the possessor of said innocent and brilliant mind is a chap whom we note, with some irony, made his name corrupting them: Justin Timberlake. His character is Ted, or Fred, or Jack &#8211; not 20 minutes after the credits rolled I honestly can&#8217;t remember &#8211; a wily Princeton brainbox, already in penury for inciting games of chance amongst his college buddies, and about to get in a bit deeper when he starts mixing it with Mr Big on a Carribean Island.Oddly, Timberlake has transmogrified himself from jailbait sex magnet into a faintly oatmealish actor (if Affleck is Theodore Logan, Timberlake is William S. Preston all over) whose only remaining mystery is how he ever passed for a sex symbol, even to a twelve year old, in the first place.Affleck here plays the more charismatic part of dastardly e-Casino magnate Ivan Block. Still, this is a dramatic return to form for an unremarkable actor who has, of late, been doing a fine impression of having more to him than ever used to meet the eye.Unltimately, Runner Runner is simply a paint-by-numbers Overcoming the Monster yarn with a strange title. It relies for its glamour on the absurd contrivance that people who set up online gaming companies in places like Costa Rica actually go out there and live in Bachanalian Xanadus, humping scores of prostitutes and throwing hapless local thugs to crocodiles. Here&#8217;s the news, folks: the only people who make money in tax havens by actually living there do so by preparing board resolutions. No crocodiles.In this alternative universe (the same one inhabited by Tom Cruise&#8217;s The Firm, incidentally) there is therefore an exotic locale for Oatey Justin to voyage to, and armed henchmen, dopey customs officials, sharp-dressed undercover Feds and foxes by the armful to kick the meagre plot along. Gemma Arterton plays a budget Bond girl who seems to have been sprayed with Ronseal fencing stain.Duly kicked, Runner Runner certainly canters along. It is not blighted by continuity errors, dialogue howlers or the dull and awkward moments that beset the comparable but inferior Savages. It isn&#8217;t a bad night out, but it&#8217;s short a car chase or two to be a decent actioner (charging round a carpark with a handycam is no substitute), and is missing a sandwich or two from the picnic hamper if it&#8217;s trying to make a political point.Routine.Olly Buxton","Runner, Runner"

1462688,"&#8220;Captain America: The First Avenger&#8221; is a great addition to the burgeoning Marvel Cinematic Universe canon, and a great comic book movie, and an awesome action film in general. It certainly atones for the past sins of the Captain, mainly brief and disastrous sojourns in the 70s and one in the 90s. Google it if ye dare!This film, unlike many screen interpretations of Cap which often jump straight to modern-day heroics, was wisely done as a period piece, set in the twilight hours of World War II. We see Steve Rogers before he dons the red, white, and blue, and therefore become much more invested in his character before he was a Super Soldier. Great performances are to be had all around. Chris Evans gets Steve&#8217;s humility and all-around good guy charm. The ideals and attitude shown here prove that this was the Greatest Generation. Hayley Atwell does fine as Cap&#8217;s interest Peggy Carter, and here she&#8217;s in the army as well, putting her in the action instead of the girlfriend back home as she is normally shown, and also oddly British for some reason. Tommy-Lee Jones is as entertaining as one could expect as Army General Tommy-Lee Jones. Yeah, it&#8217;s one of those roles, but in a good way. Likewise, Hugo Weaving is great as German Hugo Weaving. But seriously, Weaving was a great choice for Cap&#8217;s eternal nemesis the villainous Red Skull. As a villain, Red Skull is pretty standard and doesn&#8217;t offer many surprises (even the face reveal was coming a mile away). Toby Jones did good as scientist Arnim Zola, and there was a cool easter egg of his comic appearance. Stanley Tucci shows his acting versatility as Dr. Abraham Erskine. All of the Howling Commandos (sans Nick Fury, contrary to comic tradition) are great too.One of the criticisms of this film is that it is a full-length feature ad for &#8220;The Avengers.&#8221; Well, there definitely was one after the credits, and it is in the title. The McGuffin of the movie exists to set up &#8220;The Avengers&#8221;, but despite all this, I believe it holds up on its own as an origin story of one of Marvel&#8217;s oldest and greatest heroes. The set-up is well paced and the action scenes deliver on the awesomeness, particularly Cap&#8217;s signature shield throwing. There is an unfortunate montage that glazes over much of the battles between the good guys and bad guys, but that&#8217;s really my only major gripe with the film. There is a suspension of disbelief that must be had in the plot, but not to the point where it breaks, and the source material forces much of it.Overall, Captain America delivers as a great superhero film. It is in many ways a set-up for &#8220;The Avengers,&#8221; but it&#8217;s a good set-up that can stand on its own.",N/A

729136,"Season 1 of Blue is essential for getting to know one of the most iconic characters in television history, Andy Sipowicz. I ha started to watch NYPD Blue shortly after Jimmy Smits joined the cast. I came to see it as one of the best TV series ever produced. I watched it from then on until the last episode.It wasn't until I went back & watched season 1 that I came to have a real appreciation for just how far Andy had come along. He went from a cop you would be afraid of, to THE cop you would want to have handle the case if you or a loved one were ever the victim of a crime. Dennis Franz showed himself to be the great actor he is taking that character from a drunk who was ready to lose his job to the leader of the squad. He lost his son, his wife & his first real friend & Dennis Franz made you feel every bit of what his character went through. It's sad that no one in Hollywood has been able to consistently write a character that does his talent justice, since the series ended.

However there are many other fine performances including Tom Petty, Willie Nelson, and George Harrison. The songs are all so good, that it would be hard not to enjoy each performance. Some years ago, I obtained a DVD of the concert, but it was not complete. In particular, it did not have the Neil Young performance, so I was very disappointed with it.

The heroine is one tough lady but, she has a soft side that shines thru.  The brilliant doctor that she pulls out of a mental institution is a hoot.

1537990,"American author John Jakes is sometimes referred to as &#8220;the godfather of the historical novel.&#8221; During his prolific career he took time away from historical subjects to write a series of novellas for &#8220;The Man From UNCLE&#8221; magazine, which provided his first tenuous link to television. However, it is for period novels and the subsequent small screen adaptations of his work &#8212; namely the &#8220;North & South&#8221; series as well as the series under review &#8212; that he is best known.Around 1976, during the American bicentennial, Jakes wrote a series of eight novels collectively entitled &#8220;The Kent Family Chronicles&#8221;. The first three novels in this series, &#8220;The Bastard&#8221;, &#8220;The Rebels&#8221;, and &#8220;The Seekers&#8221; were adapted for television at the height of the mini-series craze in the 1970s and &#8217;80s. These adaptations are a curious addition to the Acorn Media library.The typical American mini-series produced at this time tended towards panoramic, epic, multi-generational stories that afforded opportunities for casting multiple stars for maximum viewer satisfaction. At best, in a series like &#8220;Centennial&#8221; (another frontier saga made around the same time and based on the James Michener blockbuster), or either of the Herman Wouk-penned WWII-era volumes &#8220;The Winds of War&#8221; and &#8220;War & Remembrance&#8221;, the mini-series reached the heights of artistic achievement within this popular limited format. Attracting such luminaries as Robert Mitchum (in the two Wouk works), the television mini-series is generally fun to watch just to see how many stars have been assembled under one roof.This is both a blessing and a curse, as popularity with viewers doesn&#8217;t always translate into a believable performance, particularly in a period piece. This &#8220;stunt casting&#8221; (or is that mis-casting) works against the overall effectiveness of THE KENT CHRONICLES. While this point might be belaboured, one has only to cite the example of Tom Bosley as Benjamin Franklin and the point is easily made. Bosley was a good actor with numerous stage credits in a variety of roles, but he will always be remembered as Mr. C on &#8220;Happy Days&#8221;, thus rendering his believability in a period piece, let alone as one of history&#8217;s most recognizable figures, ludicrous. And then there&#8217;s Don Johnson&#8230; but I&#8217;ve already said ludicrous, so enough about the casting.A good mini-series stands or falls on the strength of its story and Jakes truly knows how to tell a tale. &#8220;The Bastard&#8221;, the first three hours of this nine hour trilogy, sets things up with the very clever metaphor of the main character&#8217;s dilemma (he is a bastard, meaning an illegitimate son) and the idea that America at the time of its quest for independence was a sort of bastard child of Great Britain. As Philippe Charbonneau (Andrew Stevens) &#8212; later known as Philip Kent &#8212; seeks to understand his circumstances and purpose in life, so the burgeoning country that became the United States of America experiences its own birth pangs and subsequent self-identification.Peppered with performances from a high-profile cast that range from brilliant to atrocious, the viewer has fun &#8220;spotting the star&#8221; while watching each chapter of the story unfold. It just takes a little extra effort to not lose sight of the reason the big-name actor is supposed to be there &#8211; to further the plot.The real surprise here is that while there is considerable merit on display &#8212; it is a very entertaining story after all &#8212; it suffers by comparison to almost anything else in the mini-series market that Acorn Media has distributed. After all, Acorn specializes in British programming, and while the production standards in British programs may suffer by comparison due to budget limitations, in almost every case the standard of acting is so far superior to US-produced fare as to be pointless to even compare the two. Taken for what it is though, an epic story of America&#8217;s becoming a nation, THE KENT CHRONICLES is entertaining &#8212; albeit light &#8212; television mini-series fare.",The Kent Chronicles

Here, he plays a disbarred lawyer who works for a local gangster but who tries to take on entrenched local corruption.

They also keep your shift irregular to the point that seeking out a second job is nearly impossible. One co-worker asked for a steady shift so that he could return to school, he was fired for his trouble.I know that Wal-Mart is not the only company that engages in this kind of behavior, but as the largest corporation in the world, I would say they deserve the largest spotlight on their awful policies and actions.As far as the documentary itself is concerned, it's dry and very low budget.

1680257,"The Best Offer is a film at once unique in its ingredients but familiar in its recipe.  I don't know... like a ""hamburger"" made with the rarest and best meats.  (That's a terrible analogy, but there it is.)  The film is both a satisfying bit of entertainment and a spotty attempt to reach a bit deeper.  I enjoyed it while it lasted, but I don't have much extended praise to share.As an art collector, artist, art historian, and somewhat of a shut-in myself the film speaks to me on several superficial levels. I utterly adore the subject matter, I still find it deeply interesting, but that isn't quite enough. The parts seem to be greater than the sum.The world of buying, selling, and forging antiques has always been ripe for cinematic and literary imagination.  It's a great juxtaposition: beauty and malice. This film fits into that lineage as a relatively cerebral and mysterious fiction; that is not to say it's particularly intelligent or especially imaginative, despite its efforts to be both. Being cerebral -- that is, existing largely around the emotions and behaviors of the central characters, as opposed to blunt action -- can be just as dumb as an explosion or a car chase at every turn... minus the thrill and with the added peril of pretentiousness.Done well, cerebral narratives are the best sort. They move us, but what's more, they offer explanations as to why we are moved in the first place. Unfortunately this film comes up short. At its core it's a basic heist drama and it winds up latching itself too faithfully to that metric. It's dressed in a promising and dizzying array of stops, starts, and meandering explorations of human nature but those are all just dressing for the same story repeated a million times. It's never particularly pretentious, although some aspects of the film grate the sensibilities: e.g. the bizarrely intelligent little person in the bar who serves as overbearing metaphor and narrative parallel; or the wealthy onlookers ogling at Virgil Oldman's gloves which he wears to protect himself from germs (gloves aren't odd, people wear them... why pretend otherwise?); or the fact that Robert appears to have a really great location for his tinkering shop but never seems to do anything... etc. But rather than embrace the stilted qualities of the main character, become mired in the melodrama of its risky plot devices, or succumb to the oft-vapid setting of the art and antiques world, the film is self-deprecating and critical enough of such things to be both party and convincing critic at the same time.  At moments the film is about much more than art or selling it/obtaining it; it digs to the core of the human qualities that make great art so lasting and so financially valuable.  But then it doesn't endeavor to illuminate its own findings.  The film stops short, or it holds back, or it doesn't understand what to do with its big, human ideas.  Perhaps this is why the disappointment is greater, for despite all of the careful construction the carry-through is so inevitable and anticlimactic that one begins to question what it was all for.The acting and technical filmic aspects of the movie are strong. Geoffrey Rush is a superb actor and he brings life to every role I've found him in -- this one proving no exception. His character is unsavory, but vulnerable; he's unsympathetic, but we manage still to dig up empathy for his circumstances.It's a movie about idiosyncrasies while managing itself to be disappointingly conventional. It's clear that the creators were aiming for more and they very well might have succeeded if they'd sacrificed a bit of style and convention. Like so many before it, The Best Offer is lost somewhere between style and substance... but the style is fun to indulge for the duration. It's a fine bit of entertainment, but sadly not much more.",The Best Offer
1672528,Doc Martin is a little known series from American Public Broadcasting.  It is a story about a quirky doctor who leaves London for a tiny seaside community in England.

1384923,"I'm a rabid MJ fan but this collection made me furious! Do not believe the product hype! Quite simply ""Michael Jackson's Vision"" promises a lot and delivers very little. There is no mention of the fact that almost all the videos are presented in 4:3 aspect ration, so if you have a television that was manufactured ten years ago, you won't have a problem. In addition, the claim that these short films have been remastered is a gross deception. As you'll see from other reviews, there are few videos that are actually in HD.I already own various DVD releases of MJs short films including the Dangerous short film collection, the two volumes of his HIStory DVDs, Moonwalker, and his Number One compilation. I even own one of the few good versions of ""The Making of Michael Jackson's Thriller"" on VHS, so when I complain about this box set, it's because there's so much to get upset about (one reviewer describes Michael Jackson's Vision as a disrespect to the memory of the artist and I couldn't agree more).One of the reasons I bought this collection is because it boasts the inclusion of the ""rarely seen 'Ghosts' directed by Stan Winston"". I own the only officially released version of this amazing short film when it came out on VHS back in the '90s. There have been illegal transfers of the 38 minute film from VHS to Video CD that are pretty low quality (like a schmuck I bought one) but currently there are no other legal version formats available. Thus my excitement to read in the product description that the short film had finally made its way to DVD - and remastered no less!! Don't you believe it.Instead of the 38 minute short film, what we are given is a 5 minute montage accompanying  the song ""Ghosts"" from MJ's ""Blood on the Dance Floor"" EP. Someone has actually gone to the trouble of butchering and reducing the original 38 minute remarkable short film down to a meaningless parade of nonsensical images. This ""limited release"" is nothing but a very expensive and poorly presented rip off. Even the booklet is lame and does not improve the quality of the product - merely a photo book of stills from the short films with scant production info. If I sound furious, it's because I really am. It's difficult to believe this was released by Epic because it smacks of the worst sort of opportunistic piracy - that is how poor the quality is! My advice: save your pennies and wait for an actual official release.",Michael Jackson’s Vision

1693037,"One of the great series of 1974. It was a bit under-watched coming in the height of ""Upstairs, Downstairs"". Released years ago as 2 sets. The picture is state of the art 70s. Adaptations of GK Chesterton and a worthy 1920 period style. Costumes, props, cars, sets are perfect for post-world war England. Combining classic storytelling and nostalgic theatre style makes this a delight for retro-TV enthusiasts. Also offers interesting peeks at guest star roles by some of Britain's finest, some looking quite young, some now deceased. Kenneth More, brilliant as Father John Brown, becomes amateur crime-solver in all 13 episodes.Titled like Chesterton's short stories, no SDH or CC, but speech is clear. This is the complete 1974 collection, but 2013-14 has 20 new Chesterton adaptations so far. Can't wait for DVDs. Chesterton wrote 48 Fr Brown stories.Only a few guest stars are listed.1 HAMMER of GOD: Fr. Brown  arrives in the village for a mission finding adultery & murder. Graham Crawden (Waiting for God0. Alun Armstrong (New Tricks).2 ORACLE of the DOG: Studies in a Col's old library offers sleuthing opportunity.

Ronald Pickup (Larkrise to Candleford). Oliver Ford-Davies (Star Wars, Land Girls).5 TOOLS of DEATH: Scot atheist tea-total tossed from a high window as Fr Brown arrives for a visit.6 MIRROR of the MAGISTRATE: 1928 Flambeau on hand when the judge is shot. The intruder Irish newsman suspect is known by Fr Brown who finds a shattered mirror clue.7 DAGGER WITH WINGS: 1928 adopted son (David Buck) gets rich Essex landowner into black magic as confessed to Fr Brown who must save him or his $$.

1690514,"In Non Stop, an air marshal (Neeson) springs into action during a transatlantic flight after receiving a series of text messages that put his fellow passengers at risk unless the airline transfers $150 million into an off-shore account.I am a fan of Neeson as I consider Taken one of the better action movies of the last few years and his acting in this movie is as strong as ever as he plays the action hero, in this case Air Marshall, very well.However, this story line is a familiar one that doesn't bring anything new to the action movie genre and reminds me of some similarly made movies with the same storyline.  Also, as is the case often in these type movies, are a series of improbable events that move the story along, such as the live news being shown on the plane, that made me say &#34;seriously&#34; and smack my forehead and events that never got quite explained in a way that made sense anyways.The movie does keep the suspense and action going for it, as it does do a good job at that even though there are numerous plot holes and improbable events that lead to the culmination of the bad guy(s) with their plan to escape, which I wont give away here but was another one of those &#34;seriously&#34; smacking the forehead moments. Along with very predictable ending that followed the formulaic conclusion and hero saves the day theme.As a pure action movie, this is ok enough popcorn fare but with its formulaic plot, improbable events that move the story along and predictable ending makes this movie less than what it could be.  Neeson was as strong as ever and this makes this movie stronger than the sum of its parts but even with that being said, it is 3 stars.",N/A

1696731,"I was quite taken back at how this sequel differed greatly from Marc Webb's first Amazing Spider-Man movie. I really loved that particular film. That was a very much more grounded & grittier interpretation that we really hadn't seen with the Sam Raimi movies & I'm not saying ones better than the other since the Raimi & Maguire trilogy is a totally different beast than what Marc Webb's doing, & I'm all for escapism. Personally, we've gotten so caught up in a post Nolan superhero movie genre where everything now has to be pure realism or nothing that we've forgotten that sense of fun & fantasy. But I digress. In this follow up which is more of a mixed bag, its still a brave attempt at perhaps wanting to have a bit more fun in the way of campy villains & easter eggs galore. Besides the top notch special effects & live action, Jamie Foxx's portrayal of Electro truly seems like he's right out of Joel Schumacher's Batman flicks as does the hammy German doctor at Ravencroft Institue. That really left me scratching my head. Was I back in 1995?? Actually I was quite surprised that Electro didn't have a much bigger role in the movie as he was pretty much being promoted as movie Spidey's new major threat yet at the same time I enjoyed that the film really centered on Garfield's Peter Parker more than anything else & not getting itself sidetracked with the bad guys or the brief trivial cameos by characters from the Spidey comics (eg; Alistair Smythe, Felicia Hardy, J. Jonah Jameson, etc.). Rhys Ifans' Lizard was a much more compelling antagonist & just seemed much more successfully realized but while Jamie Foxx's brief scenes don't seem to really add up to anything important besides some eye candy, Dane Dehaan really shine's here as a new movie interpretation of wealthy heir Harry Osbourne. He also successfully brings to life a menacing & vile Green Goblin that's much more appropriate than the Willem Dafoe version ever was. Amazing Spider-Man 2 also successfully ties up some loose ends in regards to his parents disappearance from the first film & while I don't wish to give too much away, Sally Field continues to be perfect as Aunt May & her scenes with Andrew are spectacular as is Emma Stone's Gwen Stacy. With a powerful & haunting finale to this movie I still felt somewhat short changed since SEVERAL scenes & dialogue that were present in ALL of the various trailers & TV spots are COMPLETELY ABSENT from the theatrical cut. That annoyed me the most because if you've been following the production of this movie since day one, you will certainly notice a lot of scenes just gone from what you had been seeing for months. That sort of changes your perception of the movie after you've finished watching it & to that end the film comes across as incomplete. Yet I have faith the third film will get back on a more focused track but perhaps a directors cut in the meantime Sony?",N/A
1381499,"The viewer will enjoy this movie if they seek a good story, told effectively, acted well, and paced without dull spots. Christoph Waltz nearly steals the entire show with his range in portraying the alternately brutal or thoughtful owner and manager of the circus.  Robert Pattinson demonstrates that he can act beyond the realm of vampire.  Reese Witherspoon effectively carries the role.  The supporting casts creates a full vision of the story.The sadistic behavior of the circus owner (Waltz) borders on predictable stereotype but the powerful performance by the actor overcomes the rather limited depth of writing regarding that character.  For example, the viewer may easily predict the impending irrational behavior of that character, but Waltz creates such a realistic portrayal that the rather limited writing survives that weakness.  Otherwise the story is compelling.  The direction and other production values are excellent, and the movie uses special effects and editing to enhance the story.  That is a refreshing change from so many other movies that rely on special effects as the main focus of theproduction.",Water for Elephants

Not sure why we have to suffer this animation style any longer when movies like Brave, Ice Age, Beowulf, etc. are being made.The story is a mildly interesting one, involving quite a few characters, but some of them are annoying and useless:Example #1--The Penguin--not much of a threat.  Make him run fast and heart disease should do the rest.Example #2--A very young Robin barely out of diapers.  Who wants to watch that?  I have yet to see a pre-pubescent kid win a match against a WWE wrestler, so this is destroying my suspension of disbelief.Example #3--Furthermore, Batman moralizes and complains like a sissy throughout the movie.  What about?  VIGILANTISM!  How stupid is that?  Like the Punisher pushing gun control or Martian Manhunter becoming a racist!  Give me a break.  Made me totally hate Bats.The good characters were the people behind Batwoman.  I'd watch a movie about them over Batman and his little boy wonder any day.Watch it for the Batwoman, Bane, and some cool fights.

Sharon was nine months pregnant. Sharon Tate was then married to Roman Polanski.He was filming a movie overseas and expected to be in LA shortly for the birth of their child. This was a random killing and he and his followers did not know who was living at the residence.The next night August 9th 1969; Manson instructed his family members to kill Leon and Rosemary Labianca.Again this was all random.In the movie Manson was convinced that the Beatles song ""Helter Skelter"" was a coded signal to him that a racial war was going to start sometime and in his mind it was time..The release of the song fit into his plan or theory perfectly .""Helter Skelter is coming!""By his actions he would ignite a race war.

1692761,"There are plenty of hilarious moments in Ride Along, most of them involving Kevin Hart's antics to try to gain respect from his girlfriend's brother and everyone around him. Parents should know that the PG-13 rating is really stretching it here, as there's lots of innuendo (specifically at the beginning when the main character and his girlfriend talk explicitly about their ""night plans"") and gun violence. Some of it is good-natured, and some of it isn't. Fortunately, the tone of the movie is consistently playful and entertaining throughout, and it avoids boring stretches of time or weird shifts in theme. That definitely makes a type of movie like Ride Along recommendable for anyone wanting to see an hour-and-a-half worth of well-paced comedy.It's not at all original, a criticism that has been the main reason for the film's low rating on popular sites like Rotten Tomatoes and IMDB. Most of the twists and surprises don't make the film any different from other buddy cop movies. The plot almost feels like a pit stop between moments where Kevin Hart isn't showcasing his humor. And with the slight exception of Hart, most of the acting is quite generic, like the plot itself. In particular is Ice Cube, who's really just in the movie to play the non-comedic foil.The good news is that the screenwriters didn't dwell too much on trying to sell you on those aspects. Instead it's more focused on trying to make you laugh, something that this movie does well. Because of the great timing and spacing of the many jokes in the film, the shortcomings won't prevent you from enjoying Ride Along. Viewers should go in expecting a genuinely funny movie, because that's all this type of film really needs anyway.",Ride Along

The acting is a little over dramatic at times, but nothing anymore unusual for early '50s films.

Sarah Crew (played at her finest by Shirley Temple) in a seminary lead by Ms. Minchin (excellently portrayed to perfection by Mary Nash) goes from riches to rags once she found out her father, Captain Crew, was dead while serving his country at war.  In order for Sarah to partially pay back the debt for her high priced birthday party and other expenses she had before finding out her father's death, she was forced to continue as a servant in the seminary.  However, her endurance, efforts and curiosity are tested when she believes that her father is not dead.  She is unfailingly determined to find out the truth!",N/A

1674122,"Cute animation, but that's the only positive thing I can say about this movie.Here is my list of Cons:1. They kill off the parents in a stormy sea - leaving the children behind in the castle with no protection2. The story line is weak and at times with little or no foundation of why or what is going on --  example - why is the eldest daughter &#34;cursed&#34; with Snow and Icy powers3. One of the most disturbing of all is the removal of the girl's &#34;need&#34; to be rescued by a man.  The feminist attitude of &#34;I can save myself&#34; is very thick through out the whole thing... especially at the end of the movie.4. Not much story line in this movie AT ALL ...  a slip shod messy attempt to make a movie for Disney.

382489,"The Deluxe Two-Disc Edition of the 1935 version of She is an excellent product.  It restores the film to its full length, and presents it in the original glorious black and white, plus a new colorized version supervised by Ray Harryhausen.  It also contains a full commentary on the color version by Harryhausen, and has a second disk filled with special features, on everything from the film score and the colorizing process to zoomable advertising materials and still photos.  Fragments of two previous silent versions of She are included, and some oddball features, such as trailers for horror films unrelated to She, and ten minutes of fascinating advertisements for science-oriented children's toys of the late 1950s.I first saw the 1935 She on late night TV a couple of decades ago, and thought it was a really lousy movie.  I thought it didn't follow the book closely enough, and worse, it was slow-paced, with what struck me at the time as mediocre acting, script, and special effects.  What I didn't know was that parts of the film were at the time lost, and of course TV frequently cuts out parts to make room for commercials, so I was watching a mutilated version of the film, which of course will make the script seem bad.  Also, I was watching on a small TV screen and the print was a bad, murky one.This edition of the movie completely changed my opinion.  Both the black and white and the colorized versions are restored to full length, and cleaned up.  The black and white, which I recommend watching first, is gorgeous for a 1935 film.  The colorized version is wonderful, not like the awful colorized versions of movies of 15-20 years ago.  The colors are rich, but subtle -- never loud.  And as this film is a fantasy, an adventure, and even a costumer, with some tribal and ritual dancing, and spectacular music, color is what one wants.  With the color, this movie can stand up against much of the fantasy stuff that is churned out today.The plot departures from the book don't stop the story from being effective on its own terms.  Once one accepts that the movie is almost always going to be different from the book, one can enjoy film versions with a clear conscience.  Helen Gahagan, though in some ways less youthful-looking than a goddess ought to be, has a stern and commanding beauty of her own, and plays She wonderfully, catching both the cruelty and selfishness, and the tenderness and loneliness of the character.  Randolph Scott's performance is adequate, and to the extent that it is a little stiff I would blame the director and scriptwriter as much as Scott.  Helen Mack is excellent as the third part of the love triangle.  The other supporting characters are all adequate, though She's henchmen lean toward film stereotypes, and the script and acting sometimes have a B-movie flavor.  The sets and atmosphere, on the other hand, especially in the colorized version, are truly beautiful and stirring, of A-movie quality.  For sets, music, and Gahagan's performance alone, this film is a must-see of the adventure and the fantasy genres.The box is handsome, with each disc in its own secure compartment.  The only complaint here is that the tabs, which have an unusual design, are so tight it is hard to get the DVDs out, and once you do get them out, the tabs are loosened and don't seem to have a full grip any longer.  But I think they will hold, and as each DVD is in its own compartment, they can't slide against each other.It's hard to imagine a better edition of this film.  I could nitpick about the commentary, saying that it spends too much time talking about colorization and not enough time identifying the lesser actors and so on, and that the co-commentator with Harryhausen makes a blunder about how old She is supposed to be.  But this is trivial.  This is likely the best DVD edition this film will ever have.  I can't comment on any Blu-ray version.4 stars for the film, 5 stars for the DVD edition.  I round it up to 5 stars, because for fantasy/adventure fans it is a must-have.",She VHS

Took about 3 sittings to watch the whole thing.  I get it, that there are people like this out there in the world, but why feature them in a film?  She was so vain and out of touch with reality, it's a bit disturbing that she wrote children's books.  The only positive scene in the movie came in the last few minutes.

1203581,"Disclaimer:  I have only viewed the first 2 episodes of this series. I am a &#8220;cold war&#8221; Marine from the late &#8216;50&#8217;s. I am watching the series on my Kindle using Amazon Prime.This series is as well done as any WWII action movie.  The Marine utilities look very authentic for that period.  And yes, even the bolt-action M1903 Springfield rifles shown in the series opener is an accurate portrayal for the start of the Guadalcanal campaign.Why only 4 stars?  If there was a category of 5 stars with an asterisk I would give it that.  The asterisk is for a lacking a big warning about rough language, for inaccurately showing the very limited supply of drinking water available to front line marines, and for a lack of portraying how utterly desperate the situation was for marines the first 90 days of the 6 month campaign.  Little food, limited ammo, dysentery, and jungle rot plus malaria reduced the early fighting survivors to thin emaciated young men. I know that this is hard to show in a movie with strong virile actors, but nevertheless some attempt should have been made to convey the really terrible conditions.Yes I&#8217;ve read the books that the series is based upon.

It was before television and we, with our chins propped up on our hands, would listen intently and imagine in our minds what was happening on the radio.

1663649,"In 2009, we were living in the Bay Area. We remember the New Year's shooting of Oscar Grant, the trial, the resulting riots and the protests. We saw the cellphone video of the shooting on the local news. That made watching ""Fruitvale Station"" of greater interest and importance.The first question that must be asked about ""Fruitvale Station"" is who was Oscar Juliuss Grant III? And was his life significant enough to warrant a feature film?Certainly his death on New Years Day 2009 warrants a dramatic film, but It is hard to build a 85-minute move around a ten minute event. As a result, the film spends much of its time getting into Oscar Grant's background and the relation with his family. This is important to the story, but it sets a somewhat slow, laborious pace. Once you get to the Fruitvale station shooting and hospital scenes the movie becomes gripping and powerful. The ending is rather abrupt and unexpected, however the story has been completely told so a sharp ending to the film is not out of place.Ryan Coogler's script does a good job of telling Oscar Grant's story without taking sides. The script is well written profiling the story without showing bias. Yet it shows how prejudice and racial profiling can lead to dangerous conclusions. It also shows how circumstances and coincidences can play a major role in someone's life or even death.As portrayed in the film, Oscar Grant was a decent guy who was trying, albeit not very successfully, to take care of his family. He loved his mother and was devoted to his family, but tended to mess his life up through mistakes. He was neither a saint nor a monster.As for the film's quality, both the picture and the sound leave something to be desired. The image is soft and grainy, and that can be forgiven. This film was shot in Super 16 mm format and in documentary style and so low light, grainy film works. However the dialog is muffled and many of the limes are muttered making them hard to understand. This is one American film that needs English subtitles. Whether intended or not, the audio needs to have been recorded in a clearer fashion.The script jumps around a bit between 2009, 2008, 2007. The flashbacks are informative but also confusing and, as a result, there are no markers to understand the time line.On the DVD, you can exit out of the previews with the menu button. That's a nice feature as there are far too many DVD producers who lock you into watching each and every preview before you get to the feature itself.There is no director's commentary and only two special features. Both are worthwhile watching. One, ""Fruitvale Station: The Story of Oscar Grant"" is informative and interesting. The other special feature is an interview with the director, producers and cast that took place during the premier of the film on July 12, 2013. The interview has some of the same information that is in the first special feature. However it does go into far more depth about the circumstances around the situations that faced Oscar Grant and, later, Trayvon Martin.The film entertains but also gives pause for thought for how we see and understand one another. And that's a good thing for any feature film built around real life events.",N/A

328789,"I recently watched this film &#8211; a film I hadn&#8217;t even been aware of until now &#8211; and I found it fascinating in a horrifying sort of way.  The film was financed by William Randolph Hearst, the newspaper mogul, and depicts a president who falls into a coma after a car accident, and is visited by the Archangel Gabriel while in his sickbed.  He is thereby transformed from a passive office holder, based clearly on Warren Harding, into a hard-charging leader, imbued with such determination and fire that he will let nothing stand in his way in transforming the nation for the good of the people.  President Hammond, played by Walter Huston, suspends the Constitution, ruthlessly wipes out corruption and revives the economy through a national socialist agenda (yes, national socialist, i.e. fascist, which is what the Nazis were, and which is precisely the economic program the movie suggests as necessary). When Congress tries to impeach him, he dissolves Congress.What fascinates me almost as much as the movie itself is the fact that the only ones I&#8217;ve seen criticizing it for the ominous totalitarianism it promotes do so by attempting to link it to conservatives today.  On IMDB there is a post saying Bush must have loved this movie.  On Amazon, a user review labels it a &#8220;Conservative/Religious Right/Fascist Wet Dream.&#8221;  I&#8217;ve got news for these people: this was a movie and a message of the LEFT.  Hearst was a big supporter of FDR and the New Deal.  He actually sent the script to FDR and FDR suggested certain changes, which were incorporated into the finished movie.  Apart from the plot mechanism of having the Archangel Gabriel transform the protagonist, there&#8217;s nothing of the religious, right or otherwise, in this movie at all, and conservatives or libertarians, who want to preserve constitutional, limited government would be last ones to support a program like this.On the other hand, there was a lot of support from the left for this kind of idea back when the movie was made.  It&#8217;s no surprise; fascism, national socialism, was a movement of the left, advocating government regulation and control of privately owned business.  And back when this movie was made, before the Second World War and the Holocaust, revealed the evils of fascism in stark relief, for all the world to see, a lot of the left-leaning intelligentsia in the democratic countries had much good to say about Mussolini, and even Hitler.  H. G. Wells, the famous author, was also a devout socialist, who said in 1932 that progressives must become &#8220;liberal fascists&#8221; and &#8220;enlightened Nazis.&#8221; Regarding totalitarianism, he stated: &#8220;I have never been able to escape altogether from its relentless logic.&#8221;  The poet Wallace Stevens pronounced himself &#8220;pro-Mussolini personally.&#8221;  Muckraking journalist Lincoln Steffens said that Italian fascism made Western democracy, by comparison, look like a system run by &#8220;petty persons with petty purposes.&#8221;  NAACP co-founder W. E. B. DuBois saw National Socialism as a worthy model for economic organization. The establishment of the Nazi dictatorship in Germany, he wrote, had been &#8220;absolutely necessary to get the state in order.&#8221;  FDR adviser Rexford Guy Tugwell said of Italian fascism: &#8220;It's the cleanest, neatest, most efficiently operating piece of social machinery I've ever seen. It makes me envious.&#8221;  &#8220;New Republic&#8221; editor George Soule, who avidly supported FDR, noted approvingly that the Roosevelt administration was &#8220;trying out the economics of fascism.&#8221;  George Bernard Shaw hailed Stalin, Hitler, and Mussolini as the world&#8217;s great &#8220;progressive&#8221; leaders because they &#8220;did things,&#8221; unlike the leaders of those &#8220;putrefying corpses&#8221; called democracies.  After having visited Italy and interviewed Mussolini in 1926, the American humorist Will Rogers, said &#8220;I&#8217;m pretty high on that bird,&#8221; speaking of Mussolini. &#8220;Dictator form of government is the greatest form of government,&#8221; Rogers wrote, &#8220;that is, if you have the right dictator.&#8221;  And that&#8217;s just it.  All these people who imagine dictatorship would be just dandy because you can just cut through all the red tape and &#8220;get things done,&#8221; always, ALWAYS imagine that they will, somehow, have the right dictator.History suggests otherwise.  Sure, from time to time, you will get a Marcus Aurelius, an ideal, wise, benevolent, philosopher-king.  But more often, the evidence indicates, you will get a Caligula, a Nero, a Commodus.  That&#8217;s why our founding fathers tried so hard to avoid precisely what these progressives want: power concentrated in the hands of a strong man who will &#8220;get things done.&#8221;  They realized that that kind of power would inevitably be abused.  The leader in charge now might possibly use his power wisely and virtuously, but what about all his successors?And even those leaders who appeared to so many to be wise and virtuous at the outset, often enough revealed their true natures before long.  Just a few short years after all those intellectuals sang the praises of Mussolini and Hitler, World War Two revealed those leaders to be monsters, who plunged the world into the most destructive war in human history, and caused the deaths of millions, precisely because virtually all restraint on their power had been removed, and there was nothing stopping them.It shouldn&#8217;t have taken such a stark example to warn these intellectuals about such dangers.  A reading of history should have been all that was needed.  History is choc a bloc with examples of leaders who abused their power, even when they had noble ideals.  The French Revolution provided one of the best examples of precisely their program as well: put the right people in charge, empower them to act for the good of the people, and remove all the legal impediments to enacting their program and voila&#8230; you get the Reign of Terror, not a better society.  But the example of the Reign of Terror didn&#8217;t educate the progressives then, they had to see World War Two played out, bloodily, before their eyes to get the message that absolute power corrupts absolutely.  And today&#8217;s intellectuals are no better.  Obama&#8217;s job council chairman Jeffrey Immelt said &#8220;The one thing that actually works, state run communism a bit&#8211; may not be your cup of tea, but their government works.&#8221;  UN climate chief Christiana Figueres praised communist China (the world&#8217;s top emitter of greenhouse gases) as &#8220;doing it right&#8221; as opposed to democracies, because it&#8217;s &#8220;able to implement policies because its political system avoids some of the legislative hurdles seen in countries including the U.S.&#8221;People like these scare me, because they prove the truth of what Santayana said: &#8220;Those who cannot remember the past are condemned to repeat it.&#8221;  No matter how many bloody examples there are in our history of tyrants abusing power and destroying millions of human lives, there are those among us who, in order to achieve their short term political goals, stand ever ready to throw away the freedoms our ancestors bled for, because they are too arrogant and short sighted to see that once a dictator has the kind of power they dream of, he will inevitably use it, not just to &#8220;get things done&#8221; that they approve of, but for his own ends.",Gabriel Over the White House VHS

1456968,"Okay so first off, before I even considered to watch this film. I did a number of things, I read some reviews and then watch youtube for reaction videos for the &#34;Newborn&#34; scene.It starts off fairly typical family bs. Guy use to be a porn star and wants a better life for his family(wife and little boy). So he gets the offer he can't refuse. He thinks it basic typical artsy film, but things start to get a little weird for him. There are a few scene in between with his brother and family. You can see the brother has an affection for his beautiful wife. He talks with the Missus and she basically tell him to drop out of the film. He goes to the director says no thank (at an hour in if uncut) This is where the &#34;Newborn&#34; scene takes place. It's really not as bad as it is made out to be, but does bother you little. The crying is mainly what bothered me, but it was very minor. Nothing is really shown, but it is very much implied. Your mind will create the scene. Milo (the ex porn star) still leaves and while driving, his vision goes blurred. Things go pretty south from here for poor Milo. The rest of the movie is pretty much, just connecting the memories of the night before. Milo is contentiously drugged from this point on with horny, sleeply juice. There is a scene I consider gore porn, where Milo beheads a woman while having sex. (Not very graphic or goretastic in my opinion) The only other scene that bothered me is, when Milo is taken into a room with two bodies covered on a bed, Milo is done with the larger of the two bodies and goes to the smaller. The camera shows issues and gushes of blood from the smaller body. You find out who is behind it. The ending doesn't surprise me, but it kind of right in my opinion. You don't come back from that.I am not a normal person. I have been watching tons of horror movies for over 20 years, I would suggest HIGHLY to research this movie before thinking you can do it.THIS IS NOT A CHALLENGE!!!If movies like &#34;Hannibal holocaust&#34; bother you,this is not for you!!!!If you are sensitive, this is not for you.NO HORROR NEWBIES......NO KIDS...",N/A

1649866,"Alien Uprising(released Dec/12),a re title from its original name U.F.O.,stars,among others,Bianca Bree,Sean Brosnan,Simon Philips and Jean-Claude Van Damme.This title is under the general release umbrella of Phase Four films,the same company that brought us such OSCAR &#34;contenders&#34; as Alien Armageddon and BloodRayne:The Third Reich.This film then fits right in with that companie's general dynamic and raison d'etre.Alien Uprising is yet another turkey that should give the aliens in this movie cause to invade.Any race that would create/inflict such a film into the universe,deserves extinction.The story,for what it is,finds a group of four friends,three guys and a girl,out night clubbing in England.As the plot progresses we are privy to quick intercut scenes from the future that foretell the dire path they are on.One of the guys proposes to the girl who is his long time love and she accepts.One of the other guys brings home a girl he picked up at the bar.Needless to say,both guys get lucky.They wake up the next day and the power is out in a wide area.In fact a next door neighbour heads south to meet up with his wife who works in a branch of the military.He says he will relay any info about the power outage when he gets back.The next day they are awakened by the sound of the house trembling.They rush outside to see a huge UFO hovering above the town.Thinking the worst(invasion)they rush down to a grocery store for supplies.While there a small riot breaks out,and one of the guys is forced to draw his weapon on two thugs who attempt to take their goods.They arrive back home and the guy and the girl he picked head out to his place to get more ammo for his gun.Along the way they save a girl from a car wreck and take her to get medical attention.They find a pharmacy guarded by a cop.A struggle ensues between the guy and the cop,with the cop eventually being killed by his girl friend.We are shown a purple mark on the dead cops leg afterwards.Back at the house the two guys leave to steal a car,leaving the girl behind alone.However aliens soon enter the house and she is forced to flee.Outside an alien probe is just about to waste her when two soldiers destroy the probe.As they stand talking,the two guys show back up,unable to get a car,and the other one with his girlfriend.When a tramp sneaks up and grabs one of the soldiers sidearms,the soldiers are forced to shoot him.Unfortunately one of the guys is killed in the process.The remainder then drive to an ex black ops military man's house(Van Damme).He informs the group that he has a piece of alien technology and that he and his military bosses have for years suspected alien infiltrators,that look and talk like us.The only way of telling them from humans is a purple mark.The little girl then asks:&#34;Like the one on the policeman?&#34;.The ex ops man tells them to stick with only people they know.They all turn and look at the girlfriend  the guy picked up two nights before.The military guys want to search her but her boyfriend agrees to do it.Alone in the room she shoots him dead.The others come in and she manages to overpower them all and escape outside,where a probe beams her inside of it.More probes come and as the ex black ops man offers up his piece of alien technology to them,he is disintegrated.As the rest wait to be killed,suddenly other UFOs come out of the sky and attack the alien UFOs.Back inside the house with just the little girl,one of the guys, a military man left alive,and the other girl,the now apparent alien girl who was beamed into the probe,is now seen broadcasting on TV.She is saying the earth people have won the war and to remain inside.Just then an armed assault team enters the house saying there is a little girl that can identify them.The team then kills the rest of the survivors.Fade to black.The film doesn't give out with the answers and one is kind of left to fend for themselves,plot wise.The different attacking UFOs near the end is a puzzler.One can assume,though this is guessing,that they are earth made technology and that the military has been secretly waiting for just such an invasion to use them.The film goes along slowly but surely until the scene where they try and get the little girl into the pharmacy for some medical supplies.The producers seemed to have a lot invested in the fight scene that takes place.It goes on far too long,and the film thereafter seems to drag terribly.Jean Claude Van Damme's appearance is token at best,but he makes the best of what he has to do.He appears as this black ops guy who lives by himself.We first see him on the ground looking up from underneath a soldiers legs with a shotgun.&#34;And your name is?&#34;.And of course Van Damme gets to do some of his legendary box kicking with his own daughter Bianca Bree.However you almost laugh when Van Damme gets killed.Just before the alien probe disintegrates him he says&#34;Oh S#$!&#34;.It happens so quickly and is edited the same way,that I started to laugh a little when I saw it.Bianca,by the way,needs a LOT of more time on screen to develop some proper acting chops.Her brother seems to be doing fine,but she is FAR from a steady career in acting.How she got top billing is beyond me as her part,while not as limited in scope as her fathers,is truly one that goes in and out of scenes like a fly,and with limited lines.By the way the outer cover of this DVD,is a cheat.No man with such goggles,appears any where in this film.Technically speaking the film is in its w/s a/r of 2:35:1 and is clear and crisp.Extras include a featurette and a trailer.All in all another lame brained film,with a been-there done-that kind of plot;and done FAR better elsewhere.It uses cheesy and cheap S/FX,with that quick and supposedly edgy you-are-there camera work(ala The Blair Witch Project),and the plot gets quite ponderous and slow.Until this one gets into the $5.00 bin at Walmart,like the others from Phase Four I mentioned above,give it a pass.",Alien Uprising

226961,"Barbara Hershey is never less than watchable in this intense, creepy film about one woman's struggle to overcome what might be interpreted as a series of demonic attacks. This film is able to be read upon many levels--is it her psyche, her memories of past traumas, or is there a real specter after her? One of the most frightening of all films, and definitely the best work of director Sidney J. Furie, who had only dabbled with horror themes in the past in less convicted fashion (&#34;The Snake Woman&#34; is a curio, but not much else). &#34;The Entity&#34;, while anything but a satire, thoroughly understands how effective that thriller stories are when they include very sad themes about the human condition, and this film has one of the saddest endings I can recall from a film (she is able to face her demon, but he's still with her, never wanting to stop terrorizing her as long as she lives). This is moving, very intense drama.The DVD is very good indeed, with very good sound (and a creepy music score), and a quality picture presentation. The extra feature is nice, but Furie seemed a bit hesitant to do interviews about this film. Definitely a keeper. Just see it.

Firemen work for the state to hunt for books which are forbidden to read or own. Firemen burn books now.Montag (Oskar Werner) is a fireman who methodically plies his trade, but one day comes to the realization of just how meaningless his life is after he meets a young woman who reads banned books. He happens to sneak a book into his kit while on a run, and eventually discovers himself through books and the thoughts they kindle in his once empty soul.I won't give away the ending, but as one who loves books and maintains his own private library of 1000 books, I keep returning to this film for its object lessons about socialism, the dangers of the state, and the condition of man. If you are a fan of 1984, Animal Farm, and Lord of the Flies you MUST see Fahrenheit 451.In keeping with the nature of the  film its introduction, title and credits are spoken rather than written.",Fahrenheit 451 VHS
1572622,"I was told by several friends not to see this movie because it was terrible. So I didn't. Until tonight. I am an Amazon addict so I'm hoping they will let this review stand. Tonight it came on a pay channel (which shall not be named), and I decided that I would watch it out of curiosity to see how people really think they know me so well. Obviously, they don't know me well at all!The first hour is over-the-top crazy. I decided that all my friends were right and almost deleted it then. Then Jennifer Lawrence, the young actor I like and have heard great thing about, happened. When she flew into gear in this movie about the time she started to teach Bradly Cooper to dance, I saw what all the snobby critics are seeing in her. This youngster has some very strong acting chops. The last half of the movie, Cooper slowly but surely faded into the background and Ms. Lawrence literally took the movie over, made it her's as she slyly manipulated Cooper emotionally into getting what she wanted for herself all along, or so she thought.To say more would be to ruin this movie if you haven't seen it. We have found the youngest generation's most brilliant actor - this ONE time I will say this: The critics were right! This  movie defines the word drama as in - &#34;Wow, is that girl screaming at her boyfriend a drama queen or what?&#34; Throughout the movie, there seems to be this jittery competition to see who can deliver the most drama to get the title.If you want to know the ending that threw me for a loop - you'll just have to rent it or get it here, or pick it up on the unnamed pay channel. This movie is not like any others I have seen. It is very sexy at times, and yet no one ever has sex in it. The language was rather tame, more than I am hearing it lately. But don't bring the kiddies - it is filled with adult topics and is definitely adult themed. I had a little trouble following it all the way through, as it moves very fast and you never know what most characters are going to do or say. And, I think that's part of what I liked about it. There was an old fashioned feel to it, with quirky and younger pacing.This movie is so brilliant, that you are never sure what will happens next and whether what happens will be a normal moment or, more likely, a crazy moment. Overall, this movie has a dark, emotional, CRAZY, edge to it, which probably wouldn't sit well for someone with a dark and jagged edge. I'd already had a heads up from my friends, so I simply watched it to entertain me, not to ponder whatever the message was for a few days.You'll have to watch the ending for yourselves, though.

I like that her step and aerobics are not too complicated or dancey which is why I often choose her workouts to do for the day!The warm up is nice and not too long. The step is more basic than Cathe's so its easy to follow if you are not new to step. If you are new to step, then you may need to rewind a few times, but the steps are very easy to follow just after the 1st try. I felt like the step circuit combos went by really fast. They weren't too high impact to me, but more of a good solid intermediate. You can always modify by using a higher inch step (I used a 6 inch and still got a good workout).The weight segments weren't too long, but she works them well considering the short amount of time you are working them. I felt the burn really good with the shoulder segment! :)The abs segment and short lower body (done on the step) were also very good and challanging. Time flew by really fast with this one! Her cuing was off a few times which is only why I gave it 4 stars, but it wasn't too bad where you couldn't keep up. ;) Remember, if you are a Cathe fan, then you would know that her step is way more complicated and sometimes it would take me 4 times of doing the workout until I really could follow without having to stop and rewind! ;)Overall solid A and great workout.

1189453,"I began by reading Watchmen, by Alan Moore, with Dave Gibbons, illustrator/letterer and John Higgins, colorist. Mine was the first print graphic novel edition, which the owner of a comic book store recommended and sold to me after my reading of Frank Miller's The Dark Knight Returns inspired me with the desire for more of this genre.I read Watchmen 3 times in that first month in 1988.The movie was anticipated with great expectation when it was announced some 19 years later.The movie, unfortunately, changed the original plot.The &#34;master stroke&#34; (chapter XI, page 27, top pane of the orginal novel) of Adrian Veidt (Ozymandius) brought upon New York City and the world is the irreplaceable moment in the novel, which makes everything come to its denouement. That was the book, which the movie changed.The movie betrayed Moore's genius work in a manner that is inexplicable, a paradox of screenplay writing that is at once ignorant, stupid, and critically moribund in its realization on screen. There can be no substitute as effective for this story as the original plot realization found in the original novel.I will not argue the many other commendable and satisfying features of this film that many, many others have described in this series of Customer Reviews.My desire is to point to Moore's novel. My hope is to have everyone here, who has not yet read his original work, to please try to do so at some time in the future.

85171,"I saw the film in the theaters, then immediately bought the book. Last night I watched it again, loving it as much as I did the first time.Reading the book [and subsequently The Road], I thought Cormac McCarthy had finally let go of his literary pretensions and desire to take up Faulkner's mantle and had come into his own in both these spare, lyrical and powerful late works. The Coens have also matured as filmmakers and interpreted his work beautifully in this neo-western.In 1980, Llewellyn Moss [ Josh Brolin], a survivor of two tours of duty in Viet Nam, is hunting in the desert when he stumbles across the remnants of a bloody shoot-out in a large drug sale gone wrong. Scoping the scene, he picks up a suitcase filled with two million dollars, which he believes will be his salvation [ he and his wife, Carla-Jean live on the edge of poverty in a dilapidated old trailer]. With this action, he sets into motion a series of events which will cause him to go on the run from both psychotic hitman Anton Chiguhr and  bounty hunter Carson Wells [Woody Harrelson], who is sent  by the cartel when they realize Chiguhr is out of control.Perhaps Moss overestimates his own abilities, but he believes he can prevail over his fate as his story narrows on a cross country chase to Mexico. The movie then shifts to world weary sheriff Ed Tom Bell [Tommy Lee Jones] who, while speculating on the nature of evil and violence,  desires both to help Moss and apprehend Chiguhr.Bell sees something happening as a pall of darkness falls across the land and as life, which was so comfortable and secure  in the postwar era, changes, once again reverting to the brutality and chaos that has always pervaded the West since time immemorial. The empty and dry landscape enforces his feelings of doom as Moss, the quintessential working man, who has evaded death in battle, now faces Death in the inconceivable and primeval form of Chigurh. Along the way, the story becomes bigger than itself, and bigger than the story of the last days of America, as it strips itself down to survival and the nature of life itself, bloody and raw.Brilliant direction -- the off scene violence and open end were beautifully done- and the performances by Jones, Bardem, McDonald [ Carla-Jean], and particularly Brolin who has always reminded me of a slower, rawer Kris Kristofferson were outstanding.  Highly recommended.",N/A

998980,"&#34;Oz&#34; was the first &#34;serious&#34; HBO drama, predating &#34;The Sopranos&#34; by a year. It had many of the same elements - multiple story lines, compelling and clearly drawn characters, and brutal, unrelenting violence. The setting - an experimental unit within a prison - gave the writers great latitude in setting up the various situations and interactions.Knowing several people who have been incarcerated, and having worked briefly in the R. J. Donovan Correctional Facility, and the federal Otay Detention Facility, I am not ignorant of what goes on within those walls. While some would say that the presentation of prison life in &#34;Oz&#34; was realistic, I would respond that it went beyond realism to gratuity in its clearly gleeful depiction of sadistic violence. I heard an interview with creator Tom Fontana, where he admitted that he and the writers competed to subject the characters to the most brutal and humiliating degradations imaginable. Nothing was off limits, and it showed - &#34;Oz&#34; quickly progressed from intensity to unbelievability. That's not to say that many of the events in the series had not actually happened to someone in real life - I'm sure that they had - but the center of those scenes was not the act of finding the inherent horror in violence, but approaching it from the other direction - starting with the horror and building a story around it. In this way it was like pornography, where the sex act is the entire point, and the story is only an excuse to set it up - the opposite of drama, where the story is at the center, that sometimes leads to dangerous and unexpected places.That's not to say that &#34;Oz&#34; didn't have sympathetic and engaging characters. Beecher, the attorney &#34;made an example of&#34; for his drunk-driving manslaughter of a little girl, is the terrified law-abiding citizen thrust in with vicious thugs. The wheelchair-bound Hill is the narrator, invisible and therefore able to observe all. Schillinger, a brutal white supremacist, is continually peeved by everyone's repeated mispronunciation of his name. O'Reily, the merciless hoodlum who cares for his mentally disabled brother. Idzik, who is bent on assassinating the man who with a casual, offhand comment, inadvertently shattered his entire worldview and plunged him into despair. The continually-bewildered Busmalis, who cannot seem to understand that his repeated efforts to escape are only prolonging his sentence. Different groups vie for power, individual characters build and break trust in an endless struggle for survival.* * SPOILER ALERT * *The ending, in which everyone is rounded up into buses and removed from the premises to avoid death by poison gas, is both symbolic (everyone finally &#34;escapes&#34;), and at the same time, they are all going to be &#34;new fish&#34; again, in an unknown prison with its own unpredictable and uncontrollable environment. As the bus leaves, everyone is quiet, and frightened again, as they must have been on their first day in Oz, so long ago.It may be unfair to fault &#34;Oz&#34; for not being &#34;The Sopranos&#34; or &#34;Six Feet Under,&#34; as there hadn't really been anything like it before. It proved that people would pay for premium cable in order to watch a strongly written, character-driven drama - so it paved the way for what followed, which turned out to be the &#34;golden age of cable television&#34; of the 2000s, when for a few years, the best drama wasn't on stage or in the movie theaters, as it had been until then, but on that much-maligned, lowbrow, and small-screened medium.",Oz: The Complete Seasons 1-6

62504,"I just caught this movie for the first time.  I read the book, liked the book, and figured the movie had to be worth my time.  With Streep, Hurt and Zellweger in a Quindlen novel, what could be bad?So...there's nothing bad about this movie.  Meryl Streep gives her usual impeccably nuanced performance as she plays the role of the sick matriarch, used to taking care of everybody and everything around her and now forced to rely on caregivers.  She is wonderful as she balances between trying to keep a stiff upper lip and remaining cheerful for everyone around her and giving in to the illness that is eating away at her body.  To paraphrase Braveheart, the big C may take her body but she doesn't want it to take her spirit.Renee Zellweger gives a solid performance as the daughter forced to give up a growing career in New York to come home and take care of her mother.  She plays a daughter desperate for her father's attention, willing to do most anything for a nugget of approval from him.  The dad, played by William Hurt, is sleazy in most every way - but I think Hurt plays him very well.  He's a man who has to deal with failing at both being the perfect husband and with being an accomplished writer.Watch the three of them interact with each other as they deal with the illness and help each other move through the grieving process and you learn what good actors can do with an okay script.And that's the truth - the script's just okay.

How the people who stayed at home interacted with the men who actually served in war was compelling and heartwarming and poignant.  The returning service men had a preconceived notion of what America would be like when they returned and it was quite different because the everyday life of the people in America throughout the war had not stood still.

There are plenty of fight scenes, but there is also excellent character development and many unexpected plot twists.  The only problem with this disc is the fact that the story does not end when the last episode is played.  You must buy Season Two, Part 2 to find out how the Reach is defeated.

Only now I know I did never find the classical Disney any entertaining.Too soap opera-y, too dreamy, too childish, too unbearable, too cliche.And the musicals? Nothing creeps me more than the musicals. I have to hand it to Disney: it keeps on perpetuating the toxic idea to young females about &#34;true love&#34; (usually in the form of some cute hunky guy who at first quarrels with them quite a bit but always and always puts up with their childish behavior like a tolerant father figure). Get it girls? Be as dreamy and clumsy and air-headed as you can, some guy out there will love you anyway.Name one classical Disney movie whose female protagonist doesn't yearn for love (for a prince charming, particularly) from the beginning to the end?No wonder why Disney's successful movies are with Pixar, by large. Because Disney, you're getting old!Just half way, I already figured out the whole plot and napped through the rest. It's that predictable. The pace is too slow.

I guess there's some truth to the idea that action flicks are to most men what romances are to many women.This movie also benefits from a strong cast of good actors and an excellent soundtrack. The more I study romance movies the more I see that there plotted where a suitor male or female must quest after the love of their life and that fate or destiny brings them together despite long odds. I guess that's the where the idea of 'romantic,' comes from as I've always understood it to mean. To quest after a nearly unobtainable goal.",N/A

He subsequently went on to become one of Britain's most celebrated (notorious?) drug barons, leading an exuberant lifestyle while successfully evading most attempts at capture.  Bernard Rose's biopic encourages us to admire Rose's chutzpah, as he encounters a variety of shady characters, including practicing IRA member Jim McCann (David Thewlis, speaking in an eccentric Irish accent), and American cartel owner Ernie Combs (Crispin Glover).  The film's tone remains lighthearted throughout, and there are some convincing scenes where modern-day actors are inserted into authentically Seventies archive scenes (complete with washed-out colors).  But in truth MR. NICE does not have that much to say, either about the ethics - if there can be such a thing - of drug-smuggling, nor about the lengths to which people will go to try and evade customs-officers of various countries.

113582,"Never forget the golden rule - he who has the gold makes the rules.Bogart and Holt are down on their luck, trapped in a post-revolution Mexican hellhole, much like the protagonists fromThe Wages Of Fear. Dumb enough to be suckered out of their honest pay by an unscrupulous oilman their trust in their fellow man begins to gradually fragment. They hook up with old-timey prospector Walter Huston (the director's dad and Sean Connery prototype) and head into the hills to find their fortune. Neither of the young men are cut-out for the effort and have no clue what they are doing while slowly learning from and distrusting their mentor.The real, and perhaps only, cancer in their group is Bogart's Dobbs. His lust for wealth and desperate personality crumbles under the weight of mistrust and the anxiety of outside forces stealing their loot.It's possible to find many morality lessons in John Huston's most famous film, but the main point is to be happy with what you have and if fortune comes your way then so be it, pursuing it aggressively may not lead to a happy ending. There's a lot of tension in the heavy, sweltering Mexican air, and no one feels it more than Bogart, who's performance as a man going to pieces under pressure is one of his best.Not exactly Sunday afternoon viewing, keep it for a Saturday night, watch with the lights off and immerse yourself in the near perfect black and white photography.The 1.37:1 1080p picture looks flawless with DTS HD-MA sound and a huge amount of great extras.",N/A

I did like the performances and have warmed to Jennifer Lawrence.  There are real people that are local to the shoot that are used, which really add's to the realism.  The story is taken from a novel and seems as if it could be from a true story.  I do not like to say much about the plot on my review's as this could ruin the movie if you have not watched it.  I liked it and the price was really reasonable.  It is a very realistic look @ what is happening with the meth lab's and how drug's are destroying the  fabric of our society.

1592774,"The scene in the film that stands out to me is where Lincoln (Daniel Day-Lewis) is conversing with a pair of young telegraph operators.  They wonder if whether the times we are born in are randomly selected or if we are deliberately chosen for a specific moment in time.  Lincoln then goes on to expound on a theory of the philosopher Euclid.  If two things are equal to another thing would they not be equal to one another?  There are many such moments that define this magnificent film.  My brother felt it was when one of Lincoln's war secretaries storms out of the room not willing to subject himself to Lincoln spinning another analogous tall tale. My wife fell asleep(?!).  ""Lincoln"" is a film whose power cannot be underestimated.  I thought so when I saw it in the theatre being so enthralled with Day-Lewis' portrayal of our greatest president.  Watching it a second time there were details though not overlooked the first time but overwhelmed by the central performance.  What impressed me was the poetry of the script by Tony Kushner adapted from the book by Doris Kearns Goodwin, ""Team of Rivals"".  Kushner juggles probably a few dozen characters with speaking parts and makes them full fledged players in the Universe of Lincoln. My favorite are the two lobbyists who try to influence wavering Democratic congressmen to vote for the Thirteenth Amendment to the Constitution.  The language of the film is almost Shakespearean in nature that you find yourself basking in its poetry.  Director Steven Spielberg serving as the master of ceremonies provides the aural and visual landscape for this play to unfold.  The focus, of course, is on Lincoln the man.  There's a tendency to deify him and the first time I saw this film I was taken up with Day-Lewis' charismatic turn.  Things I picked up this time in Day-Lewis' carefully calibrated performance is Lincoln's imperfections notably his wily lawyer trickiness and perhaps his shortcomings as a husband to Mary Todd (Sally Field) particularly in the wake of the death of their son, Willie.  That said these flaws not only accentuate Lincoln's fallibility but highlight his basic decency and empathy for his fellow man.  I could go on and on so rich an experience ""Lincoln"" is.  This is not merely a film but an event.  Now is definitely the time for this masterpiece.",N/A

Demi Moore plays a best-selling author living in London with a husband who isn't nearly as successful, who loses her son when he drowns and blames herself for his death.  She rents a house in an isolated village to finish her book months later, but strange things start to happen, including ghostly appearances, and the townspeople assume she's crazy.  They turn out to be a combination of the mundane and the supernatural.

There are spots where the depth of the film fails as the intensity of emotion is frittered away by a light heartedness that is inappropriate in such a war zone.  The American Soldiers as well as the Germans are a little too clean in uniform and bodily appearance for this to have been real.

Washington is also there but only in his words, in the letters he sends to the congress in Philadelphia. Some interesting political commentary, if you will, by others who would have remained loyal to King George, but most are portrayed as vigorously engaged in overthrowing colonial rule in favor of independence. Probably the two most interesting portions of the film involve personal relationships. The first is John Adams' loving relationship with his wife (as revealed in the letters they send to each other). And the second is the relationship that grows between Jefferson, Adams and Franklin. There are serious moments, for example the discussion over slavery, and funny moments with Franklin's observations of his colleagues in congress. The movie does tend to run a bit long, so some of you might get a little restless after a while. But this is still the wonderful, historic (with a great deal of license) musical/movie that is best watched on the Fourth of July.",N/A
1611861,"MAMA is a slick, stylish and scary flick from master horror producer Guillermo Del Toro and newbie director Andy Muschietti.  MAMA delivers plenty of screams and cover-your-eyes, plug your ears moments, as well as a great story and terrific cast, a hat trick that is a rare occurance within the ho hum horror genre of recent years.  There are no giant masked men chasing dopey teens through a forest in MAMA,  Instead this thoughtful and dark (and I mean DARK) drama features the ghost of an uber creepy madwoman who is both terrifying and pitiful, two rather disturbing young girls who love and fear her and, our heroine, a former grunge rock queen who doesn't even like kids.  Go figure.MAMA opens as Lucas, the father of little Victoria and Lily (darling little girls, these two), a banker with money and marriage troubles, kills his colleagues and wife, then takes the girls into what looks like the frozen tundra, all in order to kill them, then himself.  After his car skids off of a mountain road, the trio find a deserted cabin (filled with what looks like really fabulous vintage furniture).  Dad pulls a pistol out to dispense with the older of the girls, Victoria (around 5 years old or so).  As he shakily aims, a dark, floating presence grabs and kills him.  Victoria and her little sister Lily (around 2 I'd say) are left alone in this creepy cabin.  Well not alone. They've got Mama to care for them, and over the next five years this skinny, angular ghoulish figure feeds the girls cherries (I have no idea why, aside from the fact that cherries are known as the ""Devils Fruit"") and cares for them as only a ghost can.  That is to say, not really at all.The girls, when finally found by their Dad's brother, are as feral as cats, filthy and scampering about the cabin in a very odd manner. Not since Regan spider-walked down the stairs in THE EXORCIST have children looked so darned disturbing moving about on all fours.  The girls are moved to a psychiatric facility in preparation for placement with their uncle Jeffrey and his girlfriend Annabelle. And guess who comes along for the ride.Jessica Chastain plays Annabelle (and by the way, is there any better young actress out there right now?  Chastain is just marvelous in everything, including MAMA), main squeeze of Uncle Jeffrey.  With her Joan Jett black shag and tattoo sleeves, Annabelle is not a motherly figure, in fact the film opens as she thanks her lucky stars that a pregnancy test she has just taken is negative.  But because she loves Jeffrey, Annabelle  give motherhood the old college try, although mothering these two very messed up young girls, now 6 and 11, would challenge Mother Goose herself.  Unfortunately Mama takes poor Uncle Jeffrey out as soon as the new family moves in together, and as he lies in a coma, Annabelle is left to deal with the girls and their ghostly savior, who is also more than a little jealous.Tied up in this nightmare is the girls psychiatrist, who pretends to have their welfare at heart but is actually searching for proof of the paranormal, as well as another relative, an Aunt who doesn't think Jeff and Annabelle have what it takes to parent these poor little nutcases.  Lily in particular is disturbed past the point of redemption.  To her, Mama is a real parent, far more real than Jeffrey and Annabelle, and Lily cannot make the jump to any kind of normal childlike behavior, continuing to eat weird stuff (mostly moths!) and play with a gibbering, cavorting (and jointless, it seems) MAMA, who is seen peeking out of the closet, from under the bed, or just about anywhere that will really, really scare you.  Victoria, who was able to retain some language skills and has at least some memory of an ordered life, is more adaptable, and as she becomes closer to Annabelle, becomes ever more fearful of Mama's jealous rages.The film travels to the logical conclusion of a horror film of this sort, the final fight between Mama and Annabelle for the lives of the children.  And even though the ending is, for the most part, predictable, the journey is so darkly told, so evocative and creepy that MAMA will play around the corners and edges of your memory long after watching it.  This is a horror story of the first degree, with lots of jump in your seat scares and plenty of hold your breath moments.  I loved it!I'd recommend watching MAMA a few times.  I had to, because the first time I sat through it I was so darned terrified that more than half of the movie went unwatched (my eyes were closed and my fingers were in my ears).  There are lots of interesting little tidbits that only become apparent upon the second or even third viewing.  For example, watch the vignette of the drawings that the girls make that takes place under the opening titles.  It will give you some great insight as to how the girls lived in the forest those five years (what's up with those dead raccoons?).  The cherry thing is never explained (the mountain of cherry pits in the cabin is just plain weird), but you'll understand MAMA better if you can watch it without putting your hands over your eyes.This is a definite five star movie, in my humble opinion.  I love a good horror film, but really good ones are few and far between.  MAMA is everything a great horror flick should be.  Well crafted, interesting and most importantly, scarier than s***!  Watch it in the dark, with someone you love.  Now that's entertainment!",N/A

1693881,"&#8220;Small Time&#8221; is the story of Al Klein (Christopher Meloni, &#8220;Law & Order: SVU&#8221;) and his longtime friend, Ash Martini (Dean Norris, &#8220;Breaking Bad&#8221;). These two own a used car lot and know every trick in the book when it comes to selling cars. Ash has lived a carefree life, never really settling down. Al still has feelings for his ex-wife, Barbara (Bridget Moynahan, &#8220;Blue Bloods&#8221;), who left him years ago for a more successful man. After graduating from high school, their son, Freddy (Devon Bostick, &#8220;Diary of a Wimpy Kid&#8221;), decides to forgo college in favor of selling cars with his old man. Al is thrilled when Freddy moves in with him. It&#8217;s the first time the two have lived under one roof since Freddy was a kid. Barbara, however, isn&#8217;t at all pleased. She is concerned that what&#8217;s best for Al might not be best for their son, as Freddy quickly transforms from innocent kid into a seasoned shark.This is the first big-screen effort from Joel Surnow (TV&#8217;s &#8220;24&#8221;), who wrote the screenplay and directed. Surnow has based it film at least in part on personal experience. He worked into his mid-twenties with his father as a carpet salesman. With a cast mostly of TV actors, this comedy/drama is appealing in its colorful assortment of characters, but structurally there are problems.Freddy&#8217;s transition from awkward novice in the used car business to fast-talking sharpie occurs too quickly to be believable. Overall, however, the movie effectively shows the developing relationship between a father and son getting to know each other for the first time.

1682559,"Everything you read in the reviews for this film on Amazon.com is true. If you have seen the film Nebraska you will be familiar with the background scenery of Middle America. The film seems (from the reviews) to have caught quite accurately the day to day life of the inhabitants of these non descript towns for both gays and straights. I suppose we are more familiar with straight life dramas than gay ones which have tended to be confined to LA or New York - where the camera crews and creative teams are located. They may not want to locate to Anywhere Nebraska or, as Bill Bryson would call it, Duddsville.The acting in the film is first class. Each and every character gives a first class performance. Gabe's former wife plays the over anxious divorcee out on the town particularly well. Too well for her suitor who is overwhelmed by her. In reality nothing very dramatic happens in the film. No murders. No guns. No police chases or international conspiracies. We have the story lines of two very different men running concurrently. They don't actually meet until the last few minutes of the film but its significance is only brought home to the viewer from watching their lives unfold from the beginning. Unrequited love, unfaithful partners, former partners and unsuccessful dating attempts fill the lives of both of these men as they exist in the same town totally unaware of each other.Their pasts are brought out slowly in conversations with other people. We know Gabe went to College and wasn't a builder all his working life. We get the backstory to the mysterious man in the coma in the Nursing Home and his family history. It is all done in a few lines but done really well.Don't deprive yourself of the experience. Just relax and let it just take you over. You may find you have a lot in common with the characters in the film. Thankfully these sort of low key, low budget films have not faltered on low quality.

1672147,"Finally Director Sergio Sollima's elusive political western 'THE BIG GUNDOWN' aka 'LA RESA DEI CONTI'- 1966 has come to the Blu-Ray format and in its original 110 minute cut showing how Columbia Pictures was just interested in the shoot-em-up value at the time rather than a complete story.  You've read about this magnificent film in the reviews contained within but I just had to put in my two cents (once again) because not only has it been over twenty years since I saw the wide screen American cut  on Turner Classic Movies but now the full story can really be appreciated by the reinstated scenes deleted from the American version.  Lee Van Cleef's portrayal of Corbett is fully realized as a man only resorting to the way of the gun when he has to kill.  Running for political office as Senator, he's boxed into a corner by going after an innocent man to further the careers of others including his own.  The film becomes Corbett's odyssey by putting him through memorable set pieces making him realize his purpose in life and also the way of life of Cuchillo played brilliantly by Tomas Milian, one of Europe's greatest actors. The theme of pedophilia is ironically used when Corbett finds out that Cuchillo has accompanied a thirteen year old girl for a swim at a river in a Morman camp. After he gets shot for his troubles, the priest asks Corbett why he bothered.  When told that he wanted to save his daughter from the clutches of the rapist, the priest shrugs and says,'Sarah is not my daughter, she's my fourth wife' leaving Corbett stunned into realization. This is what makes this film stand out from other Spaghetti's at that time.  Only the works of Sergio Corbucci  would come close to the visions of Sollima and Sergio Leone in this respect.  It is also impossible to imagine the film having the impact that it does without the brilliant music score by the master Ennio Morricone who fills every frame with a memorable theme including Beethoven's 'FUR ELISE' during the climactic shootout between Corbett and the Baron. It is preserved in a bonus CD included in the package to allow you to feel its magnificence on its own.  The flawless cinematography by Carlo Carlini seals the package especially in 1080p 2.35 wide screen. Unfortunately, some may be disappointed in the full version because it is in Italian with English Subtitles and you do not hear the voice of Van Cleef. The film is peppered with great actors : You'll see the most memorable role of Lee Van Cleef's career utilizing his famous eye glare to the hilt;  Tomas Milian would go on to other memorable characters in his career including Nico Giraldi and the psychotic villain Giulio Sacchi in Director Umberto Lenzi's scathing 'ALMOST HUMAN' aka ' MILANO ODIA; LA POLIZIA NON PUO SPARARE'- 1974 . Milian would play Cuchillo again in Sollima's inferior sequel 'RUN,MAN,RUN ' aka 'CORRI, UOMO ,CORRI'- 1967 and also star in Sollima's best Western 'FACE TO FACE' aka 'FACCIA A FACCIA' -1967 which as yet has not seen a digital release.  Gerard Herter plays the sadistic reptilian German Baron with just the right touch of evil and the gorgeous Nieves Navarro aka Susan Scott as the black widow leaves a memorable trace of perfume long after the film fades to black.  Navarro would grace many memorable Giallo thrillers for her husband Luciano Ercoli in the Seventies.  You will also spot Fernando Sancho, Nello Pazzafini, Antonio Casas, to name but a few memorable faces.

However, she is terribly outshone by actor, Alden Ehrenreich, who plays love interest Ethan Wate.  Ehrenreich's charisma absolutely carries the film.  He is better or at least on par with the veteran actors, namely Emma Thompson, Jeremy Irons and Viola Davis.  Ethan has dreams of a dark-haired girl, and he is sees her in school.  He is overcome by Lena's quirkiness, and he seeks to protect her.  They get together, fall in love, and Ethan is engrossed in her world.  I loved the supernatural elements and special effects.

1678986,"There is not much I can add to the other reviewers that panned this horrid film, based on the classic 2003 South Korean original.  Spike Lee must have had a hard time translating the original, brilliant, psychologically disturbing version.  So he decided to ramp up the incest theme, the violence and the gore, all in all reducing it to another sub-par thriller. On a related note, one of the best production elements in the original is a long single take fight scene.  Not content with that, in Lee's version the protagonist (Josh Brolin) beats up five hulking rugby (?) players without breaking a sweat and then takes on about 25 hoodlums at once and puts them all down.  So he has mad skills.  Then when the plot calls for it, a female bodyguard drops him with two moves. Later on two thugs manhandle him without a problem.  What the heck?

However, I did make a mental note to obtain the video or stream it when it became available on Amazon.  I think the themes of magic and crime drama sort of caught my attention.Even with a plot line that is not really plausible, I really enjoyed this movie.  The acting was good and the story had me thinking about what was going on throughout the film.  The pacing and special effects were also good so that the running time of approximately two hours seemed to be a lot shorter.  I like to think that I am a fairly logical thinker and can usually figure out what's going to happen at the conclusion of movies.  However, the ending here proved surprising and interesting.When it comes to movies, my wife and I rarely arrive at a consensus opinion about what we've watched.  In this case, however, we were in strong (and rare) agreement.

1463,"Mel Gibson, in his 2004 film The Passion of the Christ, gave the world a document that was truly an act of Catholic worship. The film, laced with modern sensibilities and Catholic mystic dogma, allowed the viewers to meditate on the suffering by Jesus for the propitiation of our sins. Although, the film&#8217;s delivery is obviously a product of the 21 century, the socio-political milieus of these events are quite accurately portrayed.From the gospel record of Jesus&#8217; trial before the Sanhedrin we find that Mel Gibson was accurate in showing the contradictory nature of the accusing witnesses. This seems to be by far the most accurate scene in the film. The desire of the council was to produce witnesses who would give testimony with enough evidence to condemn Jesus to death. However, the witnesses produced contradictory testimony. (Stein, 1996) As in the film, the evidence did not come forth through the witnesses but by Jesus Himself, when Jesus answered Caiaphas in the affirmative about being the Son of God, the Messiah.The film&#8217;s portrayal of Herod is very reminiscent of John Belushi&#8217;s role in the movie Animal House. Herod is portrayed in a frat boy manner obsessed with seeing a stage show of miracles. Herod made a joke out of his examination of Jesus through mockery. (Summers, 1965)  Yet, it would be interesting to know if Herod was truly the clown portrayed in the film. Herod was not interested in the claims of Jesus or His message. Herod wanted to see the miracle worker in action. It is obvious that Herod was not up to the task of an actual serious examination of Jesus or of truly considering the charges being sworn against Him. Herod did not appear interested in anything other than a stage show performed by the famous miracle worker. Herod did not find fault in Jesus. Yet, he did not seriously consider Him either. He is an example of many who have missed out on the truly important things in life by focusing on the temporal.Mel Gibson&#8217;s film portrayed Pilate as a cowardly individual who feared the outcome of a possible rebellion. Pilate in the film tries to find a way to free Jesus from execution but in the end gives in to the Jewish crowd. The gospel records are in line with the depiction of the film. Pilate saw no wrong in Jesus, certainly not anything worthy of death. Yet, with the crowd in such an excited state, calling for Jesus&#8217; death, Pilate certainly was boxed in a corner. It is possible as depicted in the film that Cesar would have moved against Pilate in the case of a rebellion. Pilate&#8217;s principles of justice then gave away to self-preservation.The film The Passion of the Christ portrayed accurately the socio-political milieu surrounding the trial and death of Jesus the Messiah. It portrayed the Jewish leaders grasping at anything to condemn Jesus to death. It depicted the none seriousness of Herod when Jesus was brought before him for inspection, and it accurately showed Pilate as a man more concerned with quelling a mob than pursuing true justice.",N/A

I really enjoyed the first Wolf Creek and picked this up as a blind buy because I figured &#34;how could  you mess this up&#34; well a few lame gore scenes and CGI Road Kill later I knew. Problem with this film is it turns a really creepy lead into just another slasher type. Also, it trys to bring back Torture Porn. I liked Hostel and Saw Series but its now played out. So Years later its really really played out. Pretty much what you have here is just one kill after another, uninspired and just buckets of gore. I love gore, but with style.

1344997,"This movie was awful, and I mostly stuck through it to see just how awful it could be.We have disjointed sequences, cutting from one location to another while a character is still talking, what seem to be thoughts about conversations and events in the past while other things are going on, people appearing wherever they need to be without any apparent motion.At the end, we get a chase thru Manhattan. First, our heroines decide to hide around the corner after running through what seemed like several blocks. Never mind the taxis. Then it's go to Chinatown, and take the subway. What? One of the pursuers appears on the train from nowhere? Better jump out. Now we're in Chinatown. But the pursuers get a tip that the ladies are there. Good thing Chinatown is a single block on Canal St, and that it takes zero time for the bad guys to show up at either end of the block. Hey, let's hop in a store! Why didn't we think of that until now? Who cares? But since Chinatown is a single block, the bad guys at either end spot the shop they go in.But they use cunning disguises and suddenly appear in Grand Central Station. Gee, why didn't they hop in a cab and go to Grand Central right away? Couldn't have a chase then. Now they're concerned about airports. So they logically get on Metro North, which doesn't go to an airport. PATH to NJ would get them to NWK. Subway and bus would get them to LGA or JFK. And a taxi would take them to any airport they wanted. Which is what they should have done 20 minutes earlier.Screw it, let's end with a pointless drawn out sequence of the ladies sitting in the Metro North train while it chugs up the Hudson River. Forget about a subway to the Bronx and a turn-around to Queens where the airports are. Forget about hopping off for a taxi. That probably wouldn't work, though, because the bad guys can teleport to wherever they may be as long as they stay in Manhattan.Seriously one of the most contrived and idiotic sequences I've seen in a long time. All logic, all time, all space, all is warped to fit the screenplay, the terrible screenplay.",N/A

But the way they delve into the emotions, jealousies, societal pressures, and their living life among Mormons who no longer follow the practice of Polygamy ... is all very well done.  They have done their research, mostly.  Yet, they really do not understand the LDS church yet, as is evidenced in the way they have portrayed the Mormons in the show, a visit to an LDS church in one episode (which was so bogus it was funny), and their slant on the automatronic-like personalities of LDS missionaries.  They also portray all Mormons as wanting to try to convert anyone they come in contact with (the truth is most Mormons are terrified of doing personal missionary work).

1021124,"While each version of Jane Eyre has its weak and strong points, this one irritates with changes from the book that are not helpful or particularly pleasing.  The more I watch successive editions of this novel over the years, the more I am annoyed with Rochester, finding him teasing and false, extremely self-centered and self-pitying and correspondingly heartless to others.  However, all of that are dominant parts of his persona initially, though he does grow through Jane's influence.  In this farce, the negatives are quite irksomely prominent, adding a whining tone, without the finer man element.  This Jane seemed to just wriggle all over for this insulting male attention, without the convincing evolution of seeing beyond the outer faults to inner qualities.  If that was even attempted to be portrayed, it certainly got lost somewhere in this modernization effort.The unhelpful departures weaken Jane (she breaks down and actually wails childishly and pathetically to him over her disappointed feelings at one point - NOT).  This effort sickeningly emphasizes Rochester's manipulative toying with her. When I saw the cover pictures of the actors, I thought they found a truly ugly Rochester, which he is supposed to be, but with redeeming character qualities.  Where were these?  Sorry, any fans of Stephens, but to me he needed the makeup to mitigate that gravely, pock marked face. It was not appropriate for Jane, though this cow certainly needed help.  Rochester is usually portrayed (more successfully) as a large man.  Instead, the miscast Jane here is actually the larger, more well nourished figure.  This Rochester is the one who looks under-nourished.  The thing is miscast throughout, including the mangy dog!There is a good laugh in here, the invented bed scene, disgusting between two unattractive persons for one thing.  Stephens works her over to her yielding pants, then proposes going away and living together as brother and sister. He avers he would not think of compromising her -- ""I wouldn't do that.""  Again, a laugh for its utter absurd contradiction and stupidity.  The thing was crude as well. Just another example of weakening and cheapening a classic, I guess so modern day viewers could relate or pay their money for the extra juice or some other boneheaded misfired non starter.Without being a strident purist, in final analysis, I honestly think the departures played against this version's authenticity even as a film.  They seemed to think they knew better, but I did not find it so.  Not a pleasing version to me at all for foundational reasons.  Actually, this attempt is another example of trying to update to modern day mores and customs. In my opinion and experience, these compromises always fail -- especially when dealing with a merited classical work.  They certainly failed here. Failed adaptation - failed movie.  Actually, this is a turkey.",N/A

When I first heard Peter Jackson was doing a 3-film version of &#34;The Hobbit&#34; I thought how can he possibly make 3 movies out of what was a much simpler and shorter story than Lord of the Rings?  After just the first film (now I've seen 2 of 3) he made me a believer.  Not only does it maintain interest throughout, but it feels less a children's story than Tolkien's book, and more interesting for adults.  There are 2 whole discs of special features in addition to the added scenes.  While they may not quite match the scale of some of the bonus features to Lord of the Rings (for example, they don't explain all over again why Tolkien's works have enduring interest; how he developed his world etc) there's plenty of interesting detail about how various scenes were shot, what felt particularly challenging to various actors, and many other details you just don't get when you only see the film in the theatre.

Travers was an artist with a Jungian orientation and a lot of ideas about mythology etc., but the movie presents her as a tiresome egotistical neurotic who secretly wallows in sentimentality.  It also soft pedals Disney's disingenuous insistence on using animation in the film.  In fact, the animation in Mary Poppins is lousy, and I've read that Travers confronted Disney angrily about it after the premier and was more less told, ""tough, little lady."" The Los Angeles and London segments are fun, but the Australian part mostly is an over-sentimentalized bore, except for the arrival of the ""original ""Mary Poppins"" toward the end.  Would have liked more of that.  And, speaking of veracity, couldn't Disney Inc. afford to do Australian locations in Australia instead of California?  Bit ridiculous to have Travers saying how much she hates California when-- according to what's on the film-- she spent her childhood on a ranch there surrounded by oaks and chaparral-- not eucalyptus and wattle.",Saving Mr. Banks

His subsequent errand into the best friend dating scene reveals no small number of reinforced stereotypes and awkward, queasy miscommunications. Rudd's an identifiable guy here, particularly for the crowd that doesn't buy into Budweiser brand of masculinity, but he's so thoroughly, maddeningly passive that the puns occasionally feel staged. It's funny, with a few genuine laugh-out-loud moments, but also safe like a sitcom given the green light to tinker with a dirty theme or two and actually wrap up its primary storyline.

Sports bore me to death, but I loved Friday Night Lights because so many of the guys were gorgeous. This series neither entertains me nor turns me on.I'm a gay male, and nothing about the female body or female sexuality excites me; in fact, it turns me off. So just the idea of a women's prison doesn't automatically get my juices flowing, and the abundant nudity and sex in this series leaves me cold and irritated. On top of that, every single character in this series is annoying, from the leads to the very least of the supporting roles.Piper Chapman is so obnoxious that she deserves far worse than what she gets here; I'd keep watching if I thought she'd eventually (hoping for sooner rather than later) get bumped off, but I know she won't. Her loser boyfriend isn't even sexy, which would be my only hope in a scenario like this.A Jewish nerd is pretty much my ideal man, but there's something very creepy about Jason Biggs (he isn't Jewish, for one thing) that negates any appeal the character might have. There aren't even any real villains I can hate, just dozens of petty, stupid, ugly, obnoxious jerks, who spend all their time posing and snarling.By the time I had struggled through the first two episodes, the ""So what?"" factor was so overwhelming that I gave up. If it gets better later, I won't know or care.",N/A

1554733,"Mary Shelly&#8217;s Frankenstein is one of the most easily recognizable characters in the history of storytelling.  Developed in 1818, Frankenstein will likely never be more appreciated than he is in his novelized form.  Over the years, there have been countless film incarnations of the character, the most prominent of which can be found in films that include The Curse of Frankenstein (portrayed by Christopher Lee), Young Frankenstein (portrayed by Peter Boyal) or in one of the more film variations, Mary Shelly&#8217;s Frankenstein (portrayed by Robert De Niro).  And, it was obviously only a matter of time before someone decided to create yet another re-envisioning of the character &#8211; which comes in the form of the new film, I, Frankenstein.From the producers (and a handful of others) that brought us the Underworld saga, Frankenstein &#8211; directed by Stuart Beattie (Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl, Australia) &#8211; stars Aaron Eckhart as Frankenstein&#8217;s monster, Adam.  Upon his initial awakening, the monster doesn&#8217;t see eye-to-eye with his creator Victor Frankenstein (Aden young), inevitably leading to Victor&#8217;s death.  Doing the commendable thing, Adam decides to bury his creator &#8211; but is randomly attacked by a group of demons, and then saved by a group of gargoyles.It&#8217;s at this point that Adam learns from the head of the gargoyle order, Leonore (Miranda Otto), the world is more than it seems, and there&#8217;s a war going on between Heaven (gargoyles) and Hell (demons).  Feeling isolated and without anyone to guide him, Adam wonders the world for hundreds of years &#8211; constantly being hunted by the demons, on orders from their leader, Prince Naberius (Bill Nighy).  Posing as a wealthy industry leader going by the name Charles Wessesx, Prince Naberius is secretly relying on the work of a brilliant doctor, Terra (Miranda Otto), to solve the lost incarnation formula of Victor Frankenstein &#8211; with the intent to re-animate his army in waiting.In the modern day, humans are oblivious to the creatures that are living among them.  Adam, who is constantly being hunted by demons, decides to go on the offensive by eliminating them on his own.  However, during a battle, the death of human quickly leads to the gargoyles (protectors of man) decision to apprehend Adam and confine him for the good of humanity.  Now knowing the location of Adam, Naberius sends an army to apprehend him &#8211; putting Adam right in the middle of a brewing war between two very different sides of which he is both skeptical.Looking at I, Frankenstein as a standalone film is difficult since it resembles the Underworld films so closely.  This storyline basically replaces the gun-toting, leather-drenched Kate Beckinsale with a fit, stick-wielding Aaron Eckhart.  Naturally, if I had to choose &#8211; Beckinsale had much more appeal, but it&#8217;s not as though the Underworld films were anything special, either.  The franchise went on far longer than it probably should have, featuring a yawn-worthy drawn out war between vampires and werewolves, while I, Frankenstein features a similar premise &#8211; only with gargoyles and demons.  After Underworld: Awakening was released, rumors spread that the Underworld franchise was dead, so apparently the producers have thrown in the towel (for now) with the hopes that this film catches on.  But, to be honest, they shouldn&#8217;t hold their breath&#8230;Obviously, Aaron Eckhart&#8217;s most notable role to date is in playing Two-Face in The Dark Knight, and since then he&#8217;s really failed to do much to build off that role of lifetime.  He&#8217;s starred in Battle: Los Angeles and Olympus Has Fallen &#8211; both gaudy and forgettable.  Now, after playing a glorified, one-dimensional Frankenstein in a film that was doomed to fail from the get-go, it won&#8217;t help his cause in the future for acquiring significant roles.  Eckhart undoubtedly trained extensively for this role, but even with all of the action in this flick, there are still very few moments where Eckhart is able to showcase his acting ability.  Sadly, his version of a Frankenstein is nothing but an epic bore.While Eckhart was anything but memorable, his nemesis in the film &#8211; portrayed by Bill Nighy, was supremely enjoyable.  Nighy, who was also a villain in the majority of the Underworld films, plays a similar character here.  His demeanor is just so powerful and creepy that you can&#8217;t help but love him every time he plays the bad guys (which is more often than not).  His character quickly establishes himself as a man to be fear, and he sets the battle-centric tone that dominates the majority of the plot.Even though the cast is relatively expendable (meaning anyone could have done their job), the special effects are the standout achievement.  The beautiful darkness of the city, mixed with the explosiveness of the creatures (both gargoyle and demon) are surprisingly eye-pleasing, making the battle sequences the only part of the film that doesn&#8217;t make you want to check your watch or implore you to refill your popcorn.  Speaking of visuals, Eckhart looks far too much like Aaron Eckhart and not enough like a monster that was created from eight different corpses.  His voice and attire could have both gone in a better, creepier direction.  After all, Frankenstein should be scary &#8211; yet if I ran into Kate Beckinsale in a back alley, I&#8217;d be far more afraid of her than Eckhart&#8217;s version of Frankenstein.Overall, I, Frankenstein is handicapped right out of the gate by the fact that it resembles the Underworld franchise &#8211; which never really established itself as a commanding set of films to begin with.  This version of Frankenstein is mostly cartoon-ish, and not what you&#8217;d expect Frankenstein to be in the least.  Director Stuart Beattie shouldn&#8217;t even bare any of the blame when this film tanks because this script had bad news written all over it before production even started.  But, if Kate Beckinsale&#8217;s Selene character popped out during the credits and was preparing to face-off with Eckhart, maybe then this film would have generated a little excitement.  Unfortunately, that doesn&#8217;t happen and I, Frankenstein will no doubt land in whatever dark void bad movies go to after they tank at the box office.GRADE:  D+FNDNreview.com",N/A

1654168,"""Line Of Duty""(BBC/Acorn Media, 2012). . .British TV has gotten quite grim and graphic in the last couple of decades, as seen in this taut, tense police thriller about a celebrated English police detective under investigation for possible corruption and tampering with evidence. This five-part series features a strong cast of actors (all little known to American eyes, which I for one find to be a plus) portraying complex characters, each morally challenged to different degrees by the tensions between professional duty and real-world efficiency, where crime stats often interfere with crime fighting. Like HBO's ""The Wire,"" or ""Prime Suspect,"" ""Luther,"" and other modern British cop shows, this is a dark, frequently upsetting drama, slowly ratcheting up from uncomfortable ethical dilemmas to gruesome, almost nauseating violence. It's quite well written, very well acted and impeccably produced. Highly recommended, though perhaps not for the faint of heart. (DJ Joe Sixpack, Slipcue film reviews)","LINE OF DUTY, SERIES 1"

They did add greatly to the movie.  The French are more opened minded when it comes to sex.

1215777,"I found this western watchable, but absolutely nothing more and couple of hours after seeing it I already couldn't remember some details... Below, more of my impressions, with some limited SPOILERS.In 1882 the town of Appaloosa, New Mexico, is ruled by a local cattle-baron named Randall Bragg (Jeremy Irons), who doesn't hesitate to kill those who oppose him. The people of the town hire then a wandering lawman (a ""town-tamer"") named Virgil Cole (Ed Harris) and his deputy, Everett Hitch (Viggo Mortensen), to end Bragg's reign of terror... It will not be easy, as Bragg has many cards to play, including but not limited to evil henchmen like Ring Shelton (Lance Henriksen). At one moment also a ""femme fatale"" (Ren&eacute;e Zellweger) will appear and try to drive a wedge between Cole and Hitch.This is not a bad film, but it is somehow... banal. The scenario is not very good and dialogs are really lame, with a grand total of ONE good one-liner in a 115 minutes movie... Also shootouts are not very good - don't expect any brilliant action scenes. Soundtrack could as well be absent - nothing here that can be measured against some old western music...The only reason why this film is even watchable is the cast which is indeed stellar: Ed Harris, Viggo Mortensen, Jeremy Irons (who clearly had the time of his life playing a bad guy in a western!) and Lance Henriksen are always a pleasure to watch, in anything. As for Ren&eacute;e Zellweger, well, I didn't like her much in this film, mostly because I never was a fan of her, in fact quite the contrary - and also here her character is also unpleasant and annoying...Some people suggested that this film is a kind of very distant remake of 1959 ""Warlock"" with Henry Fonda and Anthony Quinn, but I strongly disagree with that. Not even mentioning many other differences, the crucial point is that in ""Warlock"" it was clear that one of ""town-tamers"" (played by Anthony Quinn) was a closeted homosexual totally in love with his boss (played by Henry Fonda). No such thing is perceptible here.Bottom line, this is a film slightly disappointing and rather banal, but still watchable, mostly for the performance of the four main male actors. It is just a pity that dialogs and action scenes are so LAME - with just a little more effort it could have been a really solid, good western. Recommended for renting rather than buying.",N/A

How they can even call this &#34;based on...&#34; I don't know.  Nothing in this is true.  Missy only had one son, Willie has died, and Belinda is her adopted DAUGHTER instead of her later in life sister...I think they had trouble coming up with new quotes and concepts as well.  Missy was quoting Marty from &#34;Love Comes Softly.&#34;  Clark even helped Missy move on the exact same way he helped Missy move on...If the story hadn't been &#34;based on...&#34; I probably would have been a lot nicer in my review, but one thing that cannot be done is killing off main characters in movies that lived in books!",Love's Unending Legacy

There is no Shaw introduction fanfare, and there is no Shaw logo on the end credits.  This movie was made by the Chang He Film Company in Hong Kong. The distribution company that released this DVD movie ""Ground Zero"" is a bootleg company that releases bootleg quality versions of films that are sometimes out of print. That is why the quality of the DVD is so bad and unprofessional. I understood this when I bought the film because it is rare and out of print film, but Ground Zero crossed the line with all the false advertising on the DVD case. They claim this is a ""Venom's Film"", while there is only 2 original Venom's in the movie, and the others new Venom's are kind of just imposters. This film was directed by legendary director Chang Cheh, and it was filmed towards the end of his career as well as the whole martial arts genre craze. The movie is in full screen so it cuts off some fight scenes, the dub is bad, and I'm not even sure if it is the original dub. If you are into long lost cult fantasy Kung Fu flicks, and need to juice up the collection with rare  films then 9 Demons is fun regardless of the poor bootleg quality of the film. I hope this movie will get a proper release one day, all Chang Cheh films deserve it.",Nine Demons VHS

Movies like this one help me understand the different books of the Bible and when I read each book in the Old Testament or the New Testament and see the movies that pertain to those books, I have a clearer understanding of what I am reading.  I am very careful to buy the movies that give the true meaning of what the Bible says and not some superficial storyline that goes is not accurate with the Bible.  This movie is great and a must have if you enjoy biblical movies, true to the Bible.",Joseph VHS
245552,I'm a James Caan fan forever.Even the beauitful Genevieve Bujold was perfect in her role.Long drawn out in parts..but worth the money.The only thing I hated about this movie & I do mean HATED ..was in the very opening of the movie their doing a t.v.commerical with four horses pulling a car..advertising...how we have  advance since horse & buggy..showing James Caan with mustage in this part only..telling the director this is all wrong.He advises the director to come to his house so that he can show him pictures of his grandfather or great  grandfather from the 1800's how it was..then it fads into the movie in the 1800's.I still can't figure out that part of the movie..it just didn't make any sense to me.But the movie itself was slow....BUT...So real to life.Thankyou.

1677969,"I just saw this yesterday when it arrived from Netflix.  Since I completely panned Flashpoint Paradox, I thought it was only fair to give a review on this one, which I found to be a much more enjoyable movie than the last one.  There was a time in my life when I read a lot of comic books, but that has not happened in the last twenty five years. So most of the new developments in either Marvel or DC is something I look up in Wikipedia when I feel like doing so, as I feel that these movies should be judged on their standalone merit.First of all, the animation was different and also about a dozen times better than their last effort at a Justice League movie.  It was almost as good as the Young Justice TV series, which I consider to have the best, most realistic animation of any animated superheroes program I've ever seen.  Before I proceed, there will be some spoilers in this review, so you are warned.  According to other reviews, this is taken from the first few issues of their rebooted JLA series.  I also realize that you can't tell everything in an 80 minute movie, so that's not a problem.  The movie moved along acceptably and there were no blaring gaps in the movie as it was presented.  My main gripes with the movie are the way some of these characters are presented.  I felt that Batman, Flash, and Cyborg were portrayed acceptably (I reiterate that it is nice to see the Flash portrayed like a responsible adult). I also thought that the character development with Cyborg was particularly well done.  I also feel that Green Lantern was portrayed like far more of an arrogant punk then he should have been.  Can someone please explain how an angry little stealing brat like Billy Batson (as portrayed) could become Captain Marvel?  That makes no sense to me at all, and it makes his character somewhat unbelievable in this presentation.Now we come to the nitty gritty; Superman and Wonder Woman.  The blue boy scout is obviously the most iconic superhero in the world but as presented his character flaws were quite startling.  The so called fight between Superman and Batman & Green Lantern was probably more accurate than anything else presented before, providing you are dealing with a Superman with no compunction about hurting people weaker than himself.  The most unbelievable part to me is why Batman, who always knows everyone else inside out, did not have some kryptonite insurance to stop Superman if need be.  I agree with other reviewers that a partial loss of innocence in the big guy is probably not such a bad idea, but it seemed too much here.  As for Wonder Woman, frankly, I am starting to wonder if some person(s) on the production staff don't have domestic issues, considering how she has been presented in the last two JL movies.  She behaved like a spoiled arrogant over the top feminist brat from start to finish, and for someone who is supposedly millennia old, this is not a compliment to her character, although I found the ice cream scene hysterical. She behaved a bit too macho most of the time (although I freely admit Captain Marvel really had it coming).  Another thing is that her constant use of the sword and more importantly the emphasis on blinding Darkseid, while admittedly tactically wise, was a bit much for a movie which, again, will be seen by mostly kids, so frankly I think parents should use some caution in letting kids of a certain age watch this movie.All in all, it was a serious step up in the quality of DC's animated movies.  It is to be hoped that if any other JLA movies are made, less friction, profanity, and gore, and more character interaction, improvements in animation and voice selection will make these movies more enjoyable that some of the latest ones.  I felt that this was a movie that I would enjoy watching again, and I do recommend it, although caution should be used with respect to young viewers and certain scenes in the movie.",DCU: Justice League: War (DVD)

1677656,Oh! Here we go again. Another gay movie about  same sex partners being  not allowed to go to the Prom. We have seen it all before. This film does have a young and enthusiastic cast and there  are  good performances  from most of them.  There are the usual problems with the  script. Many of the cast look too old to  be  students at  High School. There are  also the usual  clich&eacute;s with the casting. Have one Asian and one African-American  in the  main cast  just to satisfy  people who think that  there are too many  Caucasians  and not enough  coloured people. Why weren't there more. varied  races in the cast? Let's face it . Do Caucasians make up the majority of  students in  High Schools in Los Angeles? A more multi-racial and  coloured cast  would seem more natural. The casting in the film truly discriminates in this respect. Everyone on the cast are good looking  and look like they come from  wealthy families. Not a true  representation of  the  American population. If this were a British film  then it would have been  more realistic. This film is  just a fluffy  fantasy .,GBF

1693819,"What makes Norman's story tragic is that he is such a nice kid. Yet we can see the corroding influences begin to take their toll. His over possessive mother is also a bit of a Jekyll and Hide shrew. She can be clinging and needy one moment and then screaming and obnoxious the next. What Norma does to her son is too pathetic to be a crime but unforgivable. Now his black outs have increased and he sees his mother when she isn't there and even becomes her. We have all seen the movie and grit our teeth as we see Norman heading down the road to insanity. It is cool and definitely cannot be an accident that the actor portraying Sheriff Romero bears an uncanny resemblance to the older Tony Perkins. The story development is intense. I find myself hoping against the certain knowledge of the outcome that somehow things could turn out differently for poor Norman.

1675350,"I went in with a completely open mind after hearing &#34;it's so great!&#34; from everyone. Sadly I was disappointed...While the plot seems pretty straight forward, they kind of try to make unnecessary characters tie into the movie (i.e. The rock... troll.. things?). I also felt the &#34;evil&#34; character in this movie was unnecessary and probably would've been better without this character.Also some of the character introductions (aside from the main girls [Elsa and Anna]) just didn't really tie into the plot, I mean Kristoff is an ice harvester, but they could've just introduced him the first time in the movie to Anna instead of giving him an unnecessary back story aside from what he tells her the first time they meet.Last but not least, the songs.. The songs in this movie are SO BORING, and I mean that in the most honest way possible. As a man who LOVES musicals, these songs were just kind of lackluster for a Disney movie, or any musical feature in general, even &#34;Let It Go&#34; was just kinda boring.The reason I don't hate this movie entirely (personally I give it a 2.5 star rating) was because of Olaf (The Snowman) and Sven (The Reindeer), as well as some of the grown up themes within the movie. Other than that, everything was pretty lackluster and I couldn't really connect with any of the main characters.",N/A

1690542,"Sometimes a movie comes along whose theme is topical and coincidental, and if the topic the movie coincides with is negative or of great public concern, the movie may be withheld, indefinitely withdrawn or postponed.Thus Joel Schumacher's movie Phone Booth about a sniper who terrorises a phone booth was withdrawn for a while because it coincided with the reign of terror of the Washington sniper. Premieres of Reacher starring Tom Cruise were reportedly cancelled, and some of the opening scenes reportedly edited in light of the Sandy Hook massacre, yet it was released about a month later as the rhetoric about gun control and school massacres escalated in Washington and elsewhere.The NRA's famous slogan: &#34;The only thing that stops a bad guy with a gun is a good guy with a gun.&#34;Non Stop eerily coincides with the mysterious disappearance of Malaysia Airlines flight MH 370. In the absence of facts surrounding the flight's disappearance, theories abounded, two passengers with stolen passports possibly terrorists, a deliberately disconnected communications system, the flight continuing for hours in a different direction from its last known flight path and location, speculation about the pilot's mental health, the flight spirited to an unknown destination by terrorists.As the world watched and waited, this movie came along, and as I watched it I realized how little the people on the ground know about what is really happening in the air, how they developed theories which seemed plausible to the people on the ground and to the waiting public, yet to us as the viewing audience it is entirely different.The premise of this movie is that an air Marshal played by Liam Neeson, the only person on the plane allowed to carry a gun suddenly goes rogue. Paradoxically, although our Air Marshal flies everywhere all the time, yet he is afraid of flying, and after this flight he has good reason to be. Although we don't know the Air Marshal or his character, somehow, perhaps because he is Liam Neeson we implicitly trust him, and the image conveyed to air traffic control is that he is seeking a ransom for the safe delivery of the plane, yet we see an entirely different scenario unfold on the plane, as our hero or villain, takes on an unknown adversary.Like an Agatha Christie mystery there are a series of false trails and red herrings, as the Air Marshal endeavours to solve the mystery of who is using his identity to get clean away with a ransom. Is the person even on the plane, one wonders?For instance a woman played by Julianne Moore somehow manages to swap seats to get the seat next to the Air Marshal just before takeoff. HIs own behavior seems erratic to other passengers as he violates their privacy, and provokes their ire. Even the pilots have to make decisions about who to trust. Should they trust the Air Marshal they know well, or someone on the other end of the radio. One choice could end their lives. The other could end their careers.This movie truly provokes great storytelling dilemmas.Non Stop did continually surprise me and the story did develop in surprising ways. One thing that particularly surprised me was the 'bomb protocol.' I quite enjoyed this movie, and Liam Neeson I thought did an excellent job in the leading role.If you like Neeson and you like action, you will most likely enjoy this movie.  I hope this was helpful.",N/A

1426400,"WWEOVER THE LIMIT 2011Spoilers1.REY MYSTERIO VS R-TRUTH-this was a great opening match that was putting Truth over as a heel. I miss this time period for him as I thought he was great at it. Truth would spend time grounding Rey and slowing him down as Rey wanted to be all over the place. In the end Truth gets the victory but I still feel like if given more time these two could have done so much more.2.[I-C TITLE]WADE BARRETT VS EZEKEL JACKSON-this match was all about the Corre and Jackson recently being kicked out of the group. I have always loved Barrett and was rooting for him here as he took on the powerhouse. This match is a bit slow and kinda reminds me of the old school matches. The crowd starts to come alive as the match goes on especially when Jackson puts Wade in the torture rack. But The Corre comes down to save the title as Barrett is DQ&#8217;d, they then start to beat Jackson down.3.SIN CARA VS CHAVO GUERRERO-I am a big fan of Sin Cara [Mistico, but also like the new one] and think he is absolutely talented. So when I was watching this I was probably more excited for this match more than any other. The match its self was a good one but not the best from either man. Chavo was trying to slow Cara down but Cara showcased his abilities well. He showed off his skills like going from the top rope to the outside getting major air. After a good match over all but in all honesty these two could have delivered a classic, Sin Cara gets the victory.4.[TAG TITLES]KANE & BIG SHOW VS CM PUNK & MASON RYAN-this was during the time when CM Punk was the leader of The New Nexus. This was a good tag match with The Nexus really shining here as Punk made the match and Ryan showcased his strength. Most say this match should have been on Raw but I thought it was a good match. Big Show and Kane keep the belts after a double choke slam on Ryan. Punk&#8217;s face after the match was excellent.5.[DIVAS TITLE]BRIE BELLA VS KELLY KELLY-this was your typical Divas match that could have been on Raw or something. I hate saying that but it is true. I have seen both do better and worse so over all it was ok. Bella keeps the belt here after her sister gets involved.6.[WORLD TITLE]RANDY ORTON VS CHRISTIAN-easily the best match of the night as these two just work excellent together. This is the definition of a back and forth match with each countering the other various times. The action is fast paced and it seems like one is going to beat the other only for the other to come back and vice versa. Randy [despite what I was wanting] retains the title but Christian looked excellent in defeat here.7.[KISS MY FOOT MATCH]JERRY LAWLER VS MICHAEL COLE-this match was just all about Lawler getting his revenge on Cole after everything that had happened. Cole tries to get out of it right from the start but  the ref ain&#8217;t having it. Jerry of course just runs right through him and his Colemine. Before all is said and done The King brings out Jim Ross and Eve so they can get a little payback but the best is yet to come. The man who beat Lawler himself in this type of match Bret &#8220;The Hitman&#8221; Hart stops Cole from escaping and Lawler gets his royal feet kissed.8.[WWE TITLE I QUIT MATCH]JOHN CENA VS THE MIZ-for most of this match it is basically a John Cena beat down. Miz and Alex Reilly continue to beat on Cena while trying to get him to say &#8220;I Quit&#8221;. Things get brutal especially if you are a Cena fan as he gets torn into. Then moment comes when Cena says the words, except he didn&#8217;t. The recording Miz had only fools the ref for so long and then the match is restarted. Of course this is where Cena comes to life getting that second wind even after the beating he just took and wins. This match was entertaining for the beat down but had a typical ending.BONUS1.[TRIPLE THREAT # 1 CONTENDER&#8217;S MATCH]REY MYSTERIO VS ALBERTO DEL RIO VS THE MIZ-this match happened on Raw and was the match that put the Miz in the main event of &#8220;Over the Limit&#8221;. This was a good match especially for Raw. I am glad they gave them time as well since it made it feel more important. Of course it starts out with Rey being double teamed as he was the only face. But once they got going it was every man for themselves. Each man controls for a good portion of the match starting with the Miz. From there it goes to Del Rio and onto Rey then they all trade momentum until Miz rolls Rey up for the pin. After the match Cena comes out to make his announcement for the match followed by R-Truth attacking Rey.2.BRIE BELLA VS KELLY KELLY-this was a better than average Raw Divas match. The story here was if Kelly could win she would get a title shot. Of course after showing off her skills she gets the win and gets the title shot. After the match Kharma comes out and lays the Bella&#8217;s out.3.[NO HOLDS BARRED]JOHN CENA VS JACK SWAGGER-this was a pretty good match from Raw that would see Swagger look really good against the champ. He really takes it to Cena wearing him down and beating him down. Still with Miz and Alex looking on Cena still pulls out the victory forcing Swagger to tap.4.[KISS MY FOOT MATCH]BRET HART VS JERRY LAWLER-this was the first &#8220;kiss my foot match&#8221; back from the 1995 &#8220;King of the Ring&#8221; PPV. I remember when this match first happened my brother and I were waiting for this match all night. Bret is one of the all time greats and my brother&#8217;s favorite wrestler ever. This is a good match between these two in the middle of their long lasting feud. Good action typical of their matches with momentum trading from time to time. Hakushi tries to get involved only for it to back fire with Hart eventually getting Lawler to submit to the sharpshooter. Of course Lawler has to kiss Bret&#8217;s foot and then his own nasty looking foot.You get a John Cena interview, Lawler and Cole&#8217;s contract signing, and a great segment featuring R-Truth, Bret Hart, and John Cena as other special features. This was a good event over all with some good matches and great bonus features on the Blu-ray. I would recommend this to any wrestling fan.",WWE: Over the Limit 2011

In the end, season one is a decent, if not goofy, introduction to Buffy and her high school gang who work to protect the innocent, clueless citizens of Sunnydale. As one would expect from Joss Whedon, there's plenty of humor. The bad guys are not always vampires, but almost always arrogant and not so bright. The episodes are, for the most part, stand alone, so if you miss one you won't be left in the dark, which is pretty unique in television these days where every show seems to be serialized.

1653580,"The Battle of Westerplatte was the first battle of World War II during the Nazi invasion of Poland. Though doomed from the start, the 200 soldiers garrisoned at Westerplatte held out for seven days, thus serving to inspire a nation as a symbol of resistance. In the process of enduring a naval bombardment, assault troops and dive bombers, the defenders of Westerplatte kept well over 3,000 German troops busy, buying time for other parts of Poland to prepare their defenses. The fact they didn&#8217;t stand a chance only served to reinforce, in the eyes of Poland and the rest of the free world, how vital it was to stand up to Hitler.It&#8217;s great subject matter for a film, and writer/director Pawel Chochelew has come up with a winner for the most part, even managing to inject some truly artful moments into what could easily have been just another World War II film. The problem is the special effects mostly, and the staging of the battle scenes, in part. Let&#8217;s face it, audiences are more sophisticated about CGI effects these days , so if you&#8217;re going to use them, they have to be well done. The above-mentioned dive bombers are a particularly good example of bad special effects.In Poland, the title of the film is slightly different, translating as THE SECRET OF WESTERPLATTE. Apparently the secret is that the men defending Westerplatte were actually commanded by Second in Command Capt Dabrowski, and not by Major Sucharski. While this is of only passing interest to audiences simply looking for a good war movie, it does aid the human interaction during the siege.Apparently Major Sucharski had some sort of mental breakdown during the battle, which paved the way for Capt Dabrowski&#8217;s taking over command. The scenes depicting Sucharski&#8217;s breakdown (here interpreted as epilepsy) are very well done and the director manages to find a way to bring something fresh to the war movie genre. Interesting as this is, the poor special effects and sometimes ineptly shot battle scenes (the German soldiers&#8217; frontal beach assault looks ridiculous) undermine these efforts at originality.In the end, one&#8217;s enjoyment of 1939 BATTLE OF WESTERPLATTE will be determined by what is more valued: interesting human interaction or battle scenes.",N/A
1694346,"This French film with English subtitles begins in a stereotypical romantic comedy way, with two of the protagonists literally running into each other in a park.  Arman is 33 and drifting aimlessly.  Amelie is 27, driven and more than a little cynical.  After their meeting their lives seem to twist and turn, eventually leading to another meeting and a relationship.  Tied in with the main story are other characters, including Arman's friend Benjamin and his own  love interest.  In an American romantic comedy that would have been pretty much it, but there are some deeper levels here.The story plays out from 2009 to early 2012. In stereotypical French film fashion the characters indulge in a great deal of introspection, speaking directly to the camera about their perceptions. I'm not fluent in French and had to rely on the subtitles, so some of the subtleties and ironies were undoubtedly lost on me, however I did find the characters appealing and the story interesting.  Additionally, there are some nice scenes set in Paris and in the Alps which were very lovely.","2 Autumns, 3 Winters"

1682054,"The 2013 release Dallas Buyers Club has been critically lauded. It's won many awards, not least for the 2 stars (Matthew McConaughey & Jared Leto). I was eager to see it.I wasn't disappointed. The film is based on the life of Ron Woodroof (pronounced Wood-ruff), played by McConaughey. In 1985 this good-ol' boy, straight homophobe was told that he not only had HIV, his t-cell count was so low that he was given 30 days to live. He wasn't going to take that lying down!In the film he goes to the library. He researches HIV, AIDS, & what treatments are available to him (none). He tries to con his doctor (Jennifer Garner) into putting him into an AZT trial. When he collapses again, he regains consciousness next to Rayon, a luminous transgender beauty played by Jared Leto. Rayon IS on AZT, but already splitting her trial dosage with another, & declines Woodroof's plea to split it with him too.Eventually Woodroof ends up at a clinic in Mexico. The doctor who runs it is vehement against AZT! 'That stuff is poison!' he says, & instead puts Woodroof onto a course of vitamins, protein injections, & European-approved drugs. Woodroof packs his car full of these items & heads back across the border. Where, despite wearing a priests' collar, he's stopped & questioned. Eventually he & the medication do make it back to Dallas, but here Woodroof runs up against a brick wall: his own homophobia. He just can't bear gay men, so selling something that'll save their lives is difficult for him. Re-enter Rayon...McConaughey as Woodruff is gritty. His emaciated form & drunken/stoned lurching around are entirely believable. But it's Leto, as Nylon, who electrifies the viewer. Leto also lost 30lbs for this (fictitious) role. He studied transgendered men in depth, & improvised the role of Nylon as he saw fit. He's astounding. Nylon is no angel. S/he's an AIDS-ravaged junkie who has lived her life as a sexual outlaw. In the most affecting scene, Nylon isn't even wearing makeup. Dressed as a man, he goes to visit his father, a banker. The father berates Nylon for his 'choices'. Nylon stares at his father & says 'there wasn't any choice. This is who I am.' Pow!I'll be honest; I re-watched this movie twice after my initial screening. It's simply 1 of the best films I've seen.

About six months later they come back to their hometown, where they encounter so many new species &#8211; &#8220;foodimals&#8221; like &#8220;shrimpanzees&#8221; and &#8220;watermelophants&#8221; &#8211; running around like in &#8220;Jurassic Park.&#8221;If you think the story is silly, there is more to it. Flint Lockwood is now working for a conglomerate known as Live Corp, of which head is super-inventor Chester V (probably inspired by Steve Jobs). And Chester V happens to be Flint Lockwood&#8217;s hero.Like most sequels, Sony Pictures Animation&#8217;s &#8220;Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs 2&#8221; has a weaker story than the original. The idea of basically brilliant but mishap-prone inventor is no longer refreshing; it gets even annoying especially when Flint really does not know what he is doing.There are so many colorful food-based creatures that are quite amusing to see. Like in Spielberg&#8217;s famous movie, these foodimals steal the show from human characters. &#8220;Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs 2&#8221; is visually impressive, but don&#8217;t expect too much from the story.",N/A

1422635,"I hate to admit that even though I was definitely old enough to have seen this movie when it came out, I never did -- until I found it the other night on Amazon Prime.  It's a sad tale, actually -- because the two title characters learn who they are and how to stand up for themselves after it's too late to do anything about it -- and the end of the story is not a happy one.  It was a trip seeing Brad Pitt as a young hottie with an Oakie accent.  The ensemble work was outstanding, and Harvey Keitel (who did not have a huge part) did a great job in his sympathetic role.  Can't say this will be one of my &#34;favorites&#34; that I'll watch over and over again -- but it's none the less a movie worth seeing.  Just be prepared: it's not uplifting.",N/A

1696147,"&#8220;Omar&#8221; was released on May 21, 2013, and only couple of days ago I was able to watch it on Amazon Instant Video. That&#8217;s almost a whole year before I could watch it. Months after the Oscars. I really hope Hany Abu-Assad&#8217;s next movie has better distribution channels.Abu-Assad is a genius. This has been well established by his last movie, &#8220;Paradise Now&#8221; almost 10 years ago. OK, there was another movie called, &#8220;The Courier&#8221;, starring Mickey Rourke and released in 2012. But that doesn&#8217;t count because I can&#8217;t watch it on Amazon, and not even Rotten Tomatoes have it on their list of movies.Although it&#8217;s been written that Abu-Assad wrote &#8220;Omar&#8221; in four days, it&#8217;s been probably brewing in Abu-Assad&#8217;s mind for a decade. While &#8220;Paradise Now&#8221; showed the explosive nature of youth seeking &#8216;freedom&#8217; for their country, &#8220;Omar&#8221; shows the implosive nature of youth to be free from their own demons. So &#8220;Omar&#8221; is not a political statement, it&#8217;s a statement of the self: know thyself.The story is about three young adults&#8212;in their early twenties, maybe younger: Omar (Adam Bakri), Amjad (Samer Bisharat), and Tarek (Iyad Hoorani). They are Palestinians living in the West Bank. A wall separates Israel from Palestine. Omar, the protagonist, tries to scale to the top of wall every day only to come back down as an ear-piercing shot is heard close by, always. Presumably the Israeli soldiers shooting at him don&#8217;t want to kill Omar--it&#8217;s always a warning shot: Don&#8217;t climb up the wall. He climbs anyway.The three youths have grown up hating Israel and the Israelis. What they know about Israel is as remote as looking at a random Israeli soldier through the crosshairs of a rifle they plan to use and kill. And they kill. At that moment the innocence of each one of the young men is lost forever.As justice for the murder of the soldier must be served, enter Agent Rami, played brilliantly by Waleed Zuaiter.Somewhere in the storyline there is a love story going on, too. Nadia, played by Leem Lubany, is a young and beautiful woman, who is trying to make sense of the World around her. She&#8217;s the love interest of both Omar and Amjad.The crime and the love triangle stretches Omar&#8217;s psychology thin between justice and loyalty. His great strength and agility of scaling the wall diminishes&#8230;unsure of what exactly he&#8217;s fighting for.",Omar

Start from the beginning, because the set-up matters--these are guys who failed to catch Jack the Ripper, and police the part of England (Whitechapel) where those crimes took place. The gritty setting and anti-hero status of the principle characters is absorbing, the Holmesian forensivs is sharp, and the turn-of-a-new century dynamics are relateable in our era. Immigration, discrimination, pollution, terrorism, corruption--it's all there. This is a narrative to savor, and I cannot WAIT for the further adventures of this profoundly troubled gang, who beleives that the world is bleak and godforsaken, and therefore must be fought for al the more.",Ripper Street: Season 2

1689266,"I would've laughed had someone asked me that thirty years ago. Heck, a little as five years ago. But as Stallone has reached the twilight of his career, I began to look back on his progression as an actor. And it struck me that I had seen this before - in The Duke.Consider this: It's the spring of 1970. The Academy Awards are being presented.In what was without question the peak of The Anti-Establishment Movement and the nexus of liberal America - Hollywood - for his indelible and unforgettable work in 'True Grit (1969)', the academy presented The Best Actor statue to none other than John Wayne.John Wayne. The embodiment of The Establishment. The very object of derision across the social spectrum in 1970. He won for Best Actor.Why?Why would Hollywood - the heart and soul of counterculture - give that man the top award for male thespians? He should have been shunned, laughed out of contention, but wasn't. He beat out Peter O'Toole, Richard Burton, and BOTH Jon Voight and Dustin Hoffman - only the second time in history the Academy nominated two male leads in the same film.John Wayne came up on top. He won.Why?Because despite all the rhetoric, all the anger over the war in V&iacute;et Nam, and the passion of the liberals - even they saw that the man had delivered a superlative performance. Maybe the best performance of his entire career.That kind of dispassionate objectivity - sadly lost to us nowadays - is what defines iconic film. John Wayne earned the Best Actor Oscar for a wonderful performance. Period. None of the extraneous civil discord had anything to do with one actor in one film. The man who had become the very representation of ""everything wrong"" had stepped outside his own cultural shadow and delivered.So, just like we use the name ""Rambo"" as a laughable verb and snide adjective - I look at Stallone - the actor.He's not the same man he was a generation ago. Shockingly, he's become an actual thespian. I don't think general audiences, who are distracted more than ever, has really looked at him in a role for a while now. Admittedly, he's not likely to ever win a competitive acting Oscar. But has he, over the past decades, learned enough of the craft to present a believable character? Has he the skill to step into the life of a fictional person and make it seem real?Yes.So I offer this film recommendation. A very decent movie with Oscar winners De Niro, Basinger, and the eternal Alan Arkin (one of my all-time favorite actors) delivering in another solid Peter Segal vehicle. No big surprises, the retread plot one that has been done a thousand times before - but in this film - done with excellence. Also props to Josh Bernthal, glad to see him moving up from the small screen. Notice, I didn't say ""walking"" toward a brighter future. &lt;g>Personal Notes:- I won't spoil the hilarious cameos. But if you're a fan of real-life grudge matches - trust me - worth every penny to see this flick. &lt;rofl>- Why they didn't get Tommy Hearns and Marvin Hagler into the production is a sad mystery.",Grudge Match
1455652,"Bill Nighy is absolutely superb and the acting level overall is extraordinarily high. The GOOD and why THREE STARS.Basically, it is a movie based on &#34;smart&#34; word play. I know it is British, but at the one hour point I stopped. The film &#34;Wild Target&#34; with Bill is still the best film to watch him excel!! Its has the &#34;smart&#34; word play, is fun, has a plot that moves faster than a snail too.This movie's plot line is slow - really, really slow to develop. My deep problems are with the plot line and Nighy's numerous relationships with women (his neighbor, his daughter, his lover, his ex-wife, etc.). The plot line has too many illogical holes (and the film resembles closely one other Nighy movie on world hunger) in its politically illogical allusions (I am trying not to put spoilers in my review). Bill's character is sold as a moral man within a corrupt political framework (pretty standard idea but is actually sophistry in this movie's dialog). Then there are the &#34;straw men&#34; to hate and also created as hollow characters. The character development of the British Prime Minister (Fiennes) is missing as is the character development of the Deputy Prime Minister. They are for target practice only, not to be really known. The disingenuous plotting had me wondering why I kept watching for a full hour but then I realized it was Nighy, his work was beyond belief.Nighy's relationships with the women around him played as disjointed puzzle pieces forced together but not fitting. The movie in fact reminds me of a long running British play - No Sex Please, We Are British! He shows no emotion invariably. His rapid trust in his neighbor (Weisz) is not believable as the depth of his feelings develops almost immediately (hmm...), his difficult relationship with his daughter is a patch job (time after time she is disappointed by his negative/caustic comments yet according to Nighy's character she really cares about his approval. What!) Their interaction plays more like a defiant teenager and a controlling parent, not as two adults. And it continues... Nighy's character does show affection in one line with his lover (better catch it as its short).",Masterpiece Contemporary: Page Eight

This is a wonderful animated comedy, packed with lots of action and adventure.  Two turkeys team up to travel back in time to try to take turkey off the Thanksgiving menu for good.  If this doesn't sound funny enough, these two turkeys have nothing in common with each other, argue constantly, and run into some hilarious situations when they travel back to pilgrim days.In order to change the course of history, the turkeys, Reggie (Owen Wilson) and Jake (Woody Harrelson), must first learn to get along and put aside their differences.  Reggie is a smart, although a rather lazy and weak turkey, while Jake is a strong and brave turkey, but very dumb.  This duo makes for some great comedy!  Then a female turkey that Reggie has a crush on makes it even funnier!  This role of Jenny is voiced by the very funny Amy Poehler, which could not have been cast any better. The director, Jimmy Hayward, also directed &#34;Horton Hears a Who!&#34;  He is also known for his work on &#34;Finding Nemo,&#34; &#34;Toy Story,&#34; &#34;Monsters Inc.,&#34; and many more great animated hits.

1531393,"Marvel has dipped a bit into Anime and I decided I had to get a look for myself. Naturally, Wolverine got his own, 12 episode series. The series starts off with he and the love of his life, Mariko Yashida, on a boat together when Mariko is taken. When he finally finds her, Logan discovers she is betrothed to another, at the insistence of her father, Shingen. For those who have read the comics, events in here have some resemblance to the Wolverine limited series as well as some parts of the Wolverine regular series from years ago. We do get to see some other villains, such as Omega Red show up.I am a big time Wolverine fan. I have been for years now. I did like the series, but I have some issues with it too. There is lots of action and plenty of Logan putting bad guys into a &#34;world of hurt&#34;. We get to see some cool characters such as Yukio cause some havoc. What bothers me most, however, is how Logan is portrayed but I will explain.Prior to watching this series, I watched the Anime X-Men series (which is awesome). In that series, they did a great job with the voices and the dialogue matched very well with how the characters, including Wolverine, are portrayed in the comics (or at least how they were in the 80's and 90's, I haven't collected in about 14 years). Wolverine in this series probably has one of the worst voice overs they could have chosen. It just doesn't match with the Logan that we know (or any of the voices in other animated series he has been in). He is smaller framed and thinner in this series too. It was almost as if I couldn't see him as Wolverine until he popped his claws out.The voices in general didn't come nearly as close to the quality they found for the Anime X-Men series. I know Anime in general has some lousy voice overs anyway, to the point where it is kind of funny and that is one allure of anime. It doesn't ruin the show, but it definitely does detract.

It was suspenseful and shocking, but to me it was more of a study on a group of people who developed a misplaced trust on a object that was deemed to contain answers affecting life or death.  That is all I am going to say about that, since I don't want to ruin the whole plot.The only gripe I had about it, was that it seemed to play into a stereotyping of Southern Hill type mountain people.  All you city people know that &#34;Wrong Turn&#34; is only a fictional movie and the same can be said of &#34;Deliverance&#34;, right?

It tells the Bible story of Paul, but in the present/future kind of setting.All of the people&#8217;s names are the same as the Bible and the Christians are called The Way and the ones against them and anything to do with the Bible are called The World.My Name is Paul is a very action-packed, suspenseful DVD.  It shows how Christians were persecuted, are and will be again to a very big way. The first few scenes shows Paul chasing down Christians and killing them and how Paul is recognized as a great leader.The Paul is in a car accident and loses his sight and gets lost. The members of The Way pick him up take him to their hospital and then the action really starts.I was really excited to get and review this DVD.

It is very well done, good fight scenes, good acting.  McWilliams plays Keltus the Wanderer who joins forces with an elf and an orc  to bring down the evil Shadow who is planning on bringing forth Goth Azul the Undead God.  The makeup is great and Paul D. Hunt is great as Kullimon the Orc and those bright blue eyes on Danielle Chuchran, Nemyt Akaisa the elf huntress, really makes her look hot.

1687924,"I so rarely enjoy new movies. There is very little to appreciate about most of the (rehashed) fare that's out there these days. However, Jason Reitman's directing drew me to this story. How wrong can you go with a director that gave us Juno or Up In The Air? The two lead characters are played with skill by Winslet and Brolin. The part of the young boy, Henry, was played with skill as well. The thing that really stood out (as another reviewer pointed out) was that this was much more of a heavy DRAMA than Reitman's other pieces, but the MOOD and the music surrounding this story were PERFECT. Although the plot is fairly simple and straightforward, you really end up believing that this could really happen, in a real-life situation. Only part not so believable was Adele's lack of fear through the first few encounters with Frank, as I would imagine any woman would be screaming to help save her son from a potential killer. It was never explained HOW Frank ended up being a murderer, but this didn't seem to sway Adele's affections for him. I very much applaud Jason Reitman (most of all) for helming a story this good.

1347371,"I've been searching for a few of my favorite Tarzan films for many years and I am pleased to spread the word that Warner Archives has released several Tarzan titles and many other rare films on DVD. I watched many Tarzan films as a kid mostly the films starring Johnny Weissmuller, but I watched the Tarzan TV series starring Ron Ely and many others Tarzan films starring the various actors to take on the role of the ""Lord of the Apes"".While I enjoyed seeing this film again, it didn't age well for me as this film is very juvenile even for a Tarzan film. This film features Mike Henry for the first time as the ape man and I have mixed feelings about him playing the character. Henry is likable enough, be his acting is stiff and his hair is way too perfect for my taste. He does serve a purpose though as he is like an evolutionary link between Mahoney and Ely. In this films favor, it does mark the first appearance of Manual Padilla Jr. as Tarzan's boy sidekick who went on to do another Tarzan film(Tarzan and the Great River)and played Jai on the Tarzan TV series I mentioned earlier in this review. Although playing a different character in two films he might as well have been playing Jai from the TV series.This film is quite bizarre as it starts out like a James Bond film with Tarzan dressed in a business suit or ""monkey suit""(pun intended haha!)...in you will, and out of his normal surroundings. Once he gets back to the jungle, he enlist the help of some of his jungle friends, a Leopard(thanks Karen), a Lion and a Chimpanzee before meeting up with the boy played by Padilla. The entire production to me seems a little phony(more than usual)especially comparing it to 'Tarzan's Three Challenges'. The stock footage is more obvious, the entire story seems more contrived, but once it gets going there are some very cool and memorable scenes. The helicopter grenade battle and the ending in the gold room are what I remembered from my childhood and they did not disappoint me.If you're a Tarzan fan you are going to want to pick this one up, the Warner release looks pretty good and it does include the trailer, but nothing else. I probably didn't need to own this one, but returning to the format where Tarzan enlist the aid of his jungle friends, it almost seemed like I was watching a pilot for the TV series.",Tarzan And The Valley Of Gold

1576509,"This is about the DVD's only; I have never read the books!If you love Harry Potter and have seen the other films you'd likely give this 5 stars.  First you need to see part one of &#34;THE DEATHLY HALLOWS&#34; before you watch this.  As a stand alone (that is: &#34;THE DEATHLY HALLOWS&#34; parts I & II) These films are 'dark' and a bit depressing [much like Frodo going into Mordor and Mt. Doom].  Thus the reason I give 3 stars.  The good part of it being so dark is that it is not the normal Hollywood story and ending.  I say: &#34;Film Noir is- 'Nohting good will ever come from this.&#34;  Maybe good triumphs but all will be scarred for life and will always have a black stain they carry with them.If the day comes that you are ready to watch the Harry Potter films You should watch all 8 films in a quick succession [say, one each night for 8 nights.  Most will be glad that they did.REVIEW:  &#34;THE DEATHLY HALLOWS- I & II&#34; are a dark tale which starts with 3 brothers cheating death at a place called the Deathly Hallows.  Death gives them 3 gifts- like a Djinn gives gifts.  When this part of the film come into play the Deathly Hallows, part, is as told like/as a fairy tale.  Then we jump to some future time.  We meet a disturbed guy- Tom Riddle.  Tom decides that he is best suited to rule the world- wizards, normal humans, and half breeds.  In his paranoia he puts bits of his essence into objects 'horcruxes'. Thus if he is killed there remains a link to the world, so that he can come back.We see Tom's (aka: Lord Voldemort)followers attempt to bring all of the horcruxes together.  This will allow him to achieve full form and power.  And to find the 3 peaces of the Deathly hallows, so that he may cheat death. As Tom's force gain power and size through terror they show their Progressive philosophy (We know about how to make a perfect society and world, you don't.  So, you shut up, sit back, and let us have our way.  All will be perfect and happy when we're done.)Their adversary's are &#34;The Order Of the Phoenix&#34; Which includes Harry Potter and friends.  Harry and friends decide that their action is to hunt and destroy horcruxes. As they are off searching, the battle between good and evil is going to take place at Hogwarts's.This DVD has my second favorite Harry Potter scene:  the Griffindor sword/dragon scene at Gringold's.The final battle takes place, many are lost, much is destroyed, and an outcome is achieved.If you don't like or want to see Harry Potter Then don't watch.  If you'd like to see Harry Potter then Watch it in order [over a short period of time].  &#34;THE DEATHLY HALLOWS- I & II&#34;, are dark and close to depressing.  Definitely no Hollywood story or ending here!  All of the series are top notch in: acting, directing, script, plot, story, ...The order:1- H.

1566950,"This movie makes the first Thor movie look like a bad memory.  It blows that one out of the water.  Easily.  In fact, I'd say this movie is more akin to the Avengers in style.  Truthfully, I'm not sure WHY Thor just didn't call upon a couple Avengers to help him.  Hulk alone would have evened the odds immediately.  But, alas, this is Thor's chance to shine.  He does.There are a lot of interesting foes Thor and his little gang have to contend with before they even meet the dark elves.  Then there is a lot of magic and science I cannot pretend to understand that makes the story a lot of fun to follow.  Loki and the dark elves keep the tension high in this movie.  There are a few nice twists and surprises, and a few startling ones.  (Stay for the scene that appears after the credits roll for a nice surprise).The creativity in this film is HIGH!  Fighting between realms of existence.  Following Thor's hammer as it tries to get back to him using various routes.  Magic transforming dark elves in hulking monsters.  Other monsters dropping into the fight.  Dogfights between ships with amazing powers and Norse designs.  Frigga kicking some serious . . . elf.  (Frigga pretty much saves the day until something intervenes.  Very nice.)  Kat Dennings comedy relief.  You get the idea--LOTS of fun to be had watching this film.Action-packed, loaded with superb effects, and boasting a top-notch supporting cast, Thor: The Dark World is visually stunning, at times funny, and thrilling all the way through.  No corny dialogue.  No waste-of-time love scenes.  Just a solid sci-fi fantasy story wrapped in Norse mythology.WATCH IT.  If you are a Marvel fan, BUY IT.  They did well.",N/A

143874,"&#34;Carrie&#34; is a curio from late 70's horror offerings, so it is worth watching once--if only to see how little quality that the script actually has. King's source novel provided a fairly good blueprint, but so much has been altered and left out that the real shock of the story is left circumspect as opposed to being a close interpretation. Piper Laurie thought her role was meant to be satirical, so she sort of overplays her part to a fault, bless her. Horror IS supposed to be close to satire, but unfortunately neither King nor De Palma understand how to handle it very well. Travolta has a thankless (and angering) role, helping teen slut Nancy Allen harm animals and screw up the high school prom for the sake of humiliating an already pitiful-looking girl. Sissy Spacek is a fine actress (did you ever see &#34;Badlands&#34;?), but here she is trying to support this whole anti-idea enterprise upon her little shoulders alone. Also, the story has little to say, not to mention anywhere to go. I simply don't see the point--as a horror film, it is incomplete, and as social commentary, it's too close to genre leanings to ever be literary (in any sense). Probably worth seeing as a curio, but I would not have expected the power of &#34;Scarface&#34; or &#34;Obsession&#34; if this had been the only De Palma movie I'd seen prior to those.

Lots of funny scenes, some a bit slapstick.  &#34;Mistaken identity&#34; is a reoccurring theme throughout.  Music is wonderful (so I had to buy the soundtrack as well).  The director's commentary gives all sorts of interesting insights into the making of the film.  For example, they used smoke in some of the Venetian rooms for visual effect at first, but then unfortunately were not allowed to in later scenes for fear it would cause damage.  Also, they struggled a bit getting the wig worn by Heath Ledger just right, and Lasse points that out in some of the earlier filmed scenes where he does look a bit wild.

Bonus features include a tasty ""Story Behind the Movie"", which features Paul Newman and Sally Field, several years after the 1981 release. A trailer is also here for you to enjoy (a well-crafted one, I might add). The entire cast is special  and there are many memorable moments and character nuances. Wilford Brimley is incredible. He only has fairly brief screen time, but his personna here is famously recreated in the Seinfeld episode where he grills Kramer in the Postal office. ""Newman!""(I couldn't resist, Paul!)  I really enjoy this movie, despite a few changes I'd have encouraged. Paul Newman reportedly (based on Sally Field's words in the ""Story Of..."" bonus feature) was very uncomfortable with staging the scene where he becomes angry/ violent with her. I share this sentiment, and would have had him tell her to get out and left it at that. Also, in view of all of the goings-on, I have a hard time believing the romance aspect between Field and Newman. Real? Paul setting her up? In either regard, a tough sell for me. Still, for Paul Newman fans, it's another great and understated performance. One of the better films of the '80's, and Image Entertainment , as usual, gives it a first rate spin on bluray.

1622486,"Kids on the Slope is a coming of age story by the same team behind anime classic cowboy bebop. The story focuses on the friendship between Kaoru and Sentaro. Kaoru is a bookish nerdy guy new to school who meets rough streetwise Sentaro. While the the two couldn't be anymore different they form a bond over jazz music. Set in 1966 Japan the anime is filled with musical references to not just jazz but pop music (the Beatles for example) that was current for the time.The anime reminded me a lot of John Knowles ""a separate peace"" where Kaoru's character has some paranoia and jealousy about the relationships around him. Over the course of the series we see their friendship tested over girls, music and social pressure.My only real complaint was the English dub. While the main characters are good the portrayal of supporting character Seiji is offensive. The character is artsy. In the English dub Sentai has decided to depict him as a gay stereotype completed with lisp, high pitched and overly effeminate voice all while uttering things like ""fabulous"" and ""fierce"". This type of performance is no more acceptable than old cartoons that depicted Asian characters with heavy accents saying ""you want much tasty fried lice?"". I watched the Japanese language track to compare performances. Seiji while still shy and effeminate is not the imitation of South Park's big gay Al that is found in the English dub.Overall this is a great show and I still recommend it.

The story is episodic, which might work in a novel -- but doesn't work in a film, which should have an (overall) rising sense of dread, foreboding, etc, throughout.There are one or two genuinely frightening scenes. But in a film where we don't actually /see/ anything (except, if I recall correctly, the door deforming), the failure to maintain and build tension is fatal.If you like it, fine.

1489001,"The stunning visual effects alone is worth watching this movie, which happened to be the first movie I watched on my new Amazon Fire TV (smooth...very smooth streaming).  But the plot has issues and a bit insensitive.Right off the bat the New York City traffic is thrown into chaos by humans turning into zombies, who stampede towards any stimulation they hear or see. That would be everywhere in the City. Hoards of zombies rushing like it's the day after Thanksgiving at Midtown Manhattan Macy's and no one is caring about the sick or homeless along the way; perhaps an apt metaphor to current state of consumerism. The protagonist, played by Brad Pitt, whose sole job is to protect a neurologist from Harvard, fails to protect the latter from killing himself two seconds into the movie. It's up to Pitt to save the day. Most of the World seems to be taken over by the growing number of zombies, except in one country that has the strictest entry through its walls and double--triple--visa check points: Israel. This is where the insensitivity comes. Outside the wall that Israel has put up to keep the Palestinians out is an enormous swarm of zombies that looks like an ant-colony trying to scale the wall. So, are these zombies supposed to be Palestinians? Very insensitive (see the movieOmar (Subtitled)for a more intelligent critique of the shameful wall.)  What's more Pitt really doesn't do much in Israel, except fly in a Belarus commercial airplane. As if it wasn't enough failing to prevent the neurologist from putting a hole in his head, Pitt blows up a hole in the plane turning the jet's engine into a meat grinder and his luscious blond hair tosses and swerves in its full glory amidst decompression. Would I be giving away the ending if I said Pitt saves the day?Minus the many silliness in the plot, it is taut and fun to watch, and mercifully short under two hours.",World War Z

1567763,"I think we all know the story. Maleficent (Angelina Jolie) slips Sleeping Beauty (Elle Fanning) a roofie and allows a Prince (Brenton Thwaites) to kiss on her while she is asleep and still keep it a family film. Add a spinning wheel, a castle, and a fire breathing dragon and you got the basic story.What Disney did was to retell the classic in such a magnificent way as to make you never want to watch the old one again. Maleficent is our horned fairy who is basically good. Both her and the plot develop levels of complexity that is not the norm for a children's film. There is a role reversal as good and evil blur lines until the point we root for those we had desired to fail in the original tale.Jolie was great in a role seemingly made for her. Elle Fanning would not have been my first choice, but she was sufficient, perhaps over shadowed by Jolie. My favorite line was when Jolie said, &#34;I don't want children.&#34; Sure you don't, Angelina.There is an underlying theme that perhaps our enemies aren't so evil once we see the world through their eyes. This is a kids film that adults will love. Indeed, I felt like I was eight years old munching on my popcorn, chasing it with Metamucil.The language is G rated.

1681474,"Airplane and Airplane II are two of the funniest movies ever made in my opinion.  If you are unfamilair with these movies get this combo DVD set and see for yourself.  The original Airplane still holds up for a movie made in 1980.  It was directed and written by David Zucker, Jim Abrahams, and Jerry Zucker. It stars Robert Hays and Julie Hagerty and features Leslie Nielsen, Robert Stack, Lloyd Bridges, Peter Graves, Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, and Lorna Patterson.The film is a parody of the disaster film genre, particularly the 1957 Paramount film Zero Hour!, from which it borrows the plot and the central characters,[as well as many elements from Airport 1975. The film is known for its use of absurd and fast-paced slapstick comedy, including visual and verbal puns and gags.  Airplane was a financial success, grossing over US $83 million in North America alone, against a budget of just $3.5 million.  The film's creators received the Writers Guild of America Award for Best Adapted Comedy, and nominations for the Golden Globe Award for Best Motion Picture &#8211; Musical or Comedy and a BAFTA Award for Best Screenplay.  In the years since its release, Airplane's reputation has grown substantially. The film was voted the 10th-funniest American comedy on AFI's 100 Years...100 Laughs list in 2000, and ranked sixth on Bravo's 100 Funniest Movies.The second film Airplane II: The Sequel is a 1982 sequel to the original Airplane.  The plot of this film is that in the near future, the Moon has been colonized and supports a station on its surface.  A lunar shuttle known as Mayflower One is being rushed to launch from Houston. The head of the ground crew, The Sarge (Chuck Connors), does not like what is occurring, but he defers to the airline's management.  On the flight crew are Captain Clarence Oveur (Peter Graves), First Officer Dunn (James A. Watson, Jr.) and Navigator Dave Unger (Kent McCord).  Also on board is computer officer Elaine Dickinson (Julie Hagerty).  Elaine has long since left Ted Striker (Robert Hays) and is now engaged to one of the flight crew, Simon Kurtz (Chad Everett). Striker has in the meantime been committed to an insane asylum, as he was declared mentally incompetent in a lawsuit following a test flight that Ted piloted and in which the lunar shuttle crashed. Striker believes that the lawsuit was used to silence him, because he knew there were problems with the lunar shuttle that made it unsafe, and he is once more haunted by his actions in &#34;The War&#34;, specifically the events that took place over &#34;Macho Grande&#34;, where he lost his entire squadron. When Striker reads of the upcoming lunar shuttle launch, he escapes the asylum and buys a ticket for the flight and thats just the beginning.

He is not an outdoors type and his manhood is in constant question by Texans. Jerry (Jarrod Pistilli) is the stranger. He is Craig's visiting cousin from New York.

827094,"I choose this rating because the book is good. What I like about the movie is that the history of horror began when Andre Toulon, a benign toy maker, became the master of a group of killer puppets. It's a tale of sorcery, death, resurrection and deadly revenge as told by Eric Weiss a young boy who was once protected from Hitler's SS by Toulon, Weiss, now a grown man, has spent his life trying to perfect Toulon's secret of giving life to the inanimate. In comes Maclain, a rogue agent who wants to peddle the secret on the open market. Maclain breaks into Weiss' lab, shoots and tortures him, but Weiss will not give up the secret. The tale unfolds, weaving new footage with flashbacks from previous Puppet Master films as it becomes a battle of wills between Weiss and Maclain. The new puppet master remains defiant as the assassin moves in for the kill, unaware that Weiss has found the secret and Toulon's puppets are ready to shed blood for their master again...

It was horribly directed, horribly acted, slow to the point of putting you to sleep and ends just as the real good stuff is about to start happening - RETRIBUTION.  One thing that is terribly distracting and impossible to understand is the use of modern music, loud modern music, here and there in the movie.  In particular, the rendition of Fools Rush in by one of the worst singers I've ever heard just goes on and on.  In the first part of the movie they show you to the point of just putting a gun to your head the protocol of getting her out of bed and dressed and the putting to bed of both of them. Later they just drop this totally and she is hopping into bed with the soldier anytime she wants to.  If she was spending all her time at Petite Trianon with her friends and her lover how did she have time to sleep with her husband thus explaining the second child, the boy. If this movie was based on a book then it's either the worst book about her that was ever written or it is the worst adaptation.  I am leaning toward it being the worst adaptation.  I'm glad I didn't spend any money on it.  I saw it on t.v. Yuk and double yuk.",Marie Antoinette

This box set includes four exciting mysteries with Poirot leading the investigations as only he can, but with lots of fabulous guest stars sprinkled in along the way.Three Act Tragedy - A parson dies suddenly at a party along the coast. At first it appears natural but when a similar death occurs at another party, the hostess becomes a top suspect. The drama comes in when Poirot rein-acts the death on stage.Hallo'ween Party - A young girl is murdered at a costume party and a crime novelist calls in Poirot to collaborate. It turns out the girl had been a possible witness to another murder and the pair set out to find a killer in the quaint little town.Murder of the Orient Express - A train gets stuck in a snowstorm and when a murder takes place, only Poirot came find the killer aboard a train filled with rich foreigners and royalty.The Clocks - Poirot heads to Dover to help with a naval investigation. An unidentified body and clocks stopped at the same odd time lead to a slew of suspects. As more murders take place, including the death of a German spy, Poirot must determine who the real villain is.I really enjoyed Series 12 of Poirot. It's packed with lots of mystery, intrigue, and humor.  Poirot remains an engaging character with a lot of personality (and a really cool mustache). In this series, the story of the renown Poirot is told in a way that Agatha Christie would be proud off.","Agatha Christie's Poirot - Season 12 ( Agatha Christie: Poirot ) ( The Clocks / Three Act Tragedy / Hallowe'en Party / Murder on the Orient Express ) [ NON-USA FORMAT, Blu-Ray, Reg.B Import - Spain ]"

1536929,"Once every not-so-often, I come across a movie that hits me like a punch in the face. Everything about it rings true &#8211; the script is full of zingy one-liners, the cast knows what they&#8217;re doing and it feels like this thing was made for a very good reason. This happens once in a blue moon. In this case, I&#8217;m going to tell you about a little movie I just watched called &#8220;God Bless America&#8221;.Frank Murdoch (Joel Murray) is a normal guy. He&#8217;s divorced, and his daughter is a little whiny brat, very much the product of her environment. Frank sits on his couch every night, trying to find something good on television. He sees the disgusting behavior glorified on singing and mean-girl reality shows. The problem is that this country eats this stuff up like it&#8217;s candy. People can&#8217;t get enough of their dumb entertainment and famous-for-being-famous celebutards. Frank finds out he has a massive brain tumor and will likely die soon. He considers suicide, but ultimately goes on a rampage to kill all of the stupid people wasting space on this good Earth. Likeminded teenager Roxie (Tara Lynne Barr) eventually joins forces with him, and they become a team devoted to making the world a better place, one murder at a time.With all of the mass-shootings and equally disgusting violent crime depicted on the local news every day, it&#8217;s obvious that a film this honest and cynical might not be for everyone. It glorifies violence, but at the same time it doesn&#8217;t. It is not a film of ideas, but a film of reactions. If you fall outside of the bell curve of American people who love trash culture, you might really enjoy this movie. In the back of your head, you may have wondered all along, &#8220;what would happen if someone just killed these idiots once and for all?&#8221;Another thing that makes this film remarkable to me is that it&#8217;s full of unknown actors, and yet it features two of the most memorable performances in recent memory. Murray is perfectly cast as the everyman who has simply had enough already, and Barr brings a whole lot of fun to the table. This movie will make neither of these people stars, because it&#8217;s so gloriously politically incorrect, and will likely not be accepted by the masses.&#8220;God Bless America&#8221; is a scathing satire with a gaping hole where its heart should be. It doesn&#8217;t need a heart, for it has a brain. It&#8217;s a sobering and perceptive statement on where we stand as a culture at this point in time. Even though this movie is a few years old, it feels as if it was made yesterday. It could be dismissed as left-wing propaganda, because sometimes it does get a bit heavy-handed with the political side (a Glenn Beck type is brutally murdered), it provides a point of view that isn&#8217;t biased, because in some way, we all kind of relate to Frank. If you find yourself on the couch looking for something to watch on Netflix, give God Bless America a try. It&#8217;ll give you plenty to laugh about, but a lot more to think about.Grade: A+",N/A

1072424,"The summation of these movies is --Based on a hedged promise from a known liar and manipulator, Anakin Skywalker on his own free will turns and kills everything he fought for in his entire adult life, friends, colleagues, and little children.Because he was afraid his secret wife was going to die.Even though she's completely fine.Even though the person promising him that he could save her admitted that he didn't really know how to save her, but that he might be able to figure it out.One day.But in the meantime, would you please go kill a few million people for me?Especially little children.These movies are extremely bad. The writing is simply atrocious, some of the worst writing I have ever seen in movies. They give the impression that they simply were not planned and plotted out. Instead, I get the impression that it is a bunch of impulses. Then, like a high-schooler cramming to meet the deadline, characters make incredibly illogical and out of character choices so that the necessary plot points can be hit.So Anakin Skywalker makes this very stupid choice, which really there is no argument for. Palpatine, the big evil, does his dastardly deed and scheming because...just for the heck of it. Just because, why not? The other various villains in the movies are numerous to the point of being anonymous. Count Dooku shows up at the end of Attack of the Clones and is dead at the beginning of Revenge of the Sith. His motivations are just as inane as Skywalker's. There is a General Grievous who shows up at the beginning of Revenge of the Sith and is dead about halfway through the movie. He doesn't have any motivations at all. In that time, no dread is built up. Unlike the first trilogy where we have one clear villain: Vader, in the prequels the villains are a succession of toys to be bought at target for $14.99.The thing about writing is that it is hard work. You have to plan out the payoffs and plot points. It appears that no real effort was made to do this in these movies. Things just happen, in a shower of CGI sparkles, without any payoff, without any converging themes or story elements.Speaking of CGI, they cheapen the experience. Creativity comes from constraint, but CGI allows for lazy shots of basically computer screensavers, like something you'd see in a Windows default background screen. There is no magic at all in seeing the craftsmanship which went into making static models appear like they are flying -- just do it in the computer! The enemies that the Jedi are facing are mindless droids. The battles are similarly mindless and devoid of emotion. Significant important battles have heavy CGI. Yoda especially is depicted as a tasmanian devil -- which goes completely against the Yoda of Empire Strikes Back, who was basically an Indian mystic, frail in body but strong in mind...no, in the prequels the Force is no longer mystical or religious, but is pretty much technological. Dependable, predictable, done with the press of a CGI button.Worst of worst, Lucas even had the gall to scar the original trilogies with dancing CGI thingies, and cast from the prequel trilogy. It is completely arrogant, and it is simply bad filmmaking.Seriously, the only comparable movie to this might be Battlefield Earth. Even most cheap B-movies like Jumper at least have discernible scripts and motivations. The prequels are just a jumbled mess.Lucasfilm was recently acquired by Disney, so there is some hope. One can at least hope that one day the original theatrical versions of the movies will be released in the appropriate high definition format, without any CGI scarring.One can hope that one day the prequels will simply be remade. It could happen.Until then, I'll simply stick with a few Despecialized Editions of the originals.",N/A

1681144,"Wow! Boring, Boring, Boring!! If you like to sail, don't be lured into this movie: even a weekend sailor like me would have more sailing sense then Redford shows in this movie. How alot of the events unfold in the movie just don't even make sense...(a ship container breeches the fiberglass hull on a dead calm day) and Redford's character seems old and is often asleep or falling asleep when the bilge of the boat is filled with 2 ft of water or the boat is rolling!!! Why was this character (who lacks physical strength to sail and makes the movie seem evern more tired) even in the middle of the ocean? He waits for the storm to be at full force before he gets out his storm jib...he doesn't seem to understand the importance of a working bilge pump ...fortunately, my wife...who talked me into renting this one because she loves Redford...fell asleep early in the movie, and as soon as her eyes were closed I hit the stop button and didn't have any second thoughts about not seeing how this nitwit stays alive in a life raft.

1652076,"Devil's Pass tells the story of five college students who decide to try and recreate the events of the Dyatlov Pass Incident, where nine hikers in Russia went missing while up in the Ural Mountains and mysteriously died. When these five get to their destination, strange and explainable things begin to occur, and they soon discover that whatever secret the mountain holds, they may not live to discover it.Directed by Renny Harlin (Die Hard 2, Cliffhanger), it's sadly reasonable why this movie received little press. But, this doesn't mean the film was awful. Devil's Pass was actually pretty good. I don't care for found-footage type films, but this intrigued me because of the story, and wow; i was not expecting this. The acting is good, but the script is lacking in many areas, and this is why (I think) the mind-bending ending doesn't feel as epic & terrifying. The visual effects are decent; you can tell where they started to reach the end of their budget, but honestly, i didn't think this took away from the film's atmosphere. But the cinematography in some scenes was absolutely stellar; captivating in a couple cases. Now, what really saddens me is why there aren't more horror/thriller movies that have a mind-blowing, memorable ending that completely turns the audience around, shifting into the sci-fi/fantasy genre. I hope there are at least a couple other movies that will be made in the future with similar plot twists and devices (but not as a found-footage film).3.5/5 Stars",N/A

In Gabriel he is the main character and he is vibrant, almost the moment his brown contact lenses go in, his whole persona just drains away...  his piercing eyes are always thing you watch the deepest without realizing it.  It acting in this poorly written movie of the Arch Angels, depending on what religion you view how many there really are, is phenomenal.

1336697,"I did not read the book. I am not sure why I first passed on the book when I heard of it, but when I discovered there was a movie based on it...well, to be frank, there are millions of historical fiction books I can read, but very very few period dramas I can watch, so there you go.In the three hours this movie played, I laughed (&#34;I get perish in here.&#34;), cried, nodded my head in agreement, just went through every emotion possible. On the screen we see Jamaica and England both, from the pre-WWII years to the period just after. We see men fighting for the same thing, the same damn thing--freedom from tyranny and oppression--and yet on the homefront, the West Indians, the people of color cannot get their own freedom.Hortense, Gilbert, and Michael--as Michael says--go from one small island to another, each island containing the same small minds. But they have big dreams and it's fulfilling in the end, watching these people--just when you think their lives are at rock bottom--fulfill those dreams. While left hanging about Queenie and Michael's lives, we at least know that Gilbert and Hortense find happiness.But, gosh, is a long way there. Hortense is a really hard character to like. Her upbringing, her broken heart, perhaps has made her that way and if anyone can through to her it would the charming, funny, sweet Gilbert. While all the women in the movie were drooling over Michael--a cad who preys on lonely married women--Gilbert totally stole my heart. I was ready to jump into the TV screen, murder Hortense, and take him for myself, and yes, I'd make him the best damn fish and chips if that's what it took. LOLI thought it was fascinating the way Jamaica was back then, how they were taught England was the motherland and they all thought everyone there was wealthy, with electricity in their homes, and doorbells...and it was sad to watch the people face the truth, that while they may adore the motherland, the motherland doesn't adore them. Hortense can't even teach in England. They get called names in the street. We see a lot of prejudice.The only main player NOT immigrating from Jamaica is Queenie, a white married woman who married not for love, but lack of choice. And just when she feels dead inside, something comes along to make her feel alive. She faces a world of heartbreak and at times doesn't make the best of choices.Long review short: Costumes: loved them. Issues brought up in the movie: racism, infidelity, loneliness, war, how demons are not &#34;in&#34; us, but &#34;out there&#34; (I'm not going to explain that one. It would spoil), shell shock or battle fatigue. The acting: impeccable, especially whoever it is that plays Queenie. It is a very thought-evoking movie with real issues that England faced during that time period. I felt it makes a fabulous tribute to those who immigrated from the West Indies, faced and overcame these issues, and made their dreams come true despite all the odds.Do not let the three-hour length deter you. This one is worth your time.",N/A

Even Punk, if not a work, seems like he is fed up with them.  I like TNA and ROH.  All that said - I LOVE this dvd.  The 80s NWA was the best wrestling in history...end of story.  Just watch this dvd, especially the first 4 matches.  It is so realistic and serious and the fans even cheered in a different way - instead of yelling YES like sheep they were so into it - they would ERUPT at times - just notice it - wrestling crowds were different back then.Pro Wrestling was SOOOOO much better in the 80s and this disc shows that - but there are good Wargames in the 90s too.  My sleeper match?  Watch the Midnight Express, Road Warriors, and Dr Death vs Freebirds and SST. I love that match  - so well done.  But I miss the days where they tried to be realistic and bled.  This is not good stuff...this is GREAT stuff.  The first 2 Wargames?  Two of my favorite matches ever - so intense - they hurt each other.In this disc, Brian Pillman is almost killed - FOR REAL, and JJ Dillon broke his collarbone.  That is all you need to know about this disc - excellent to watch - and Dusty's stories in between are really cool.  The Wargames is a great disc, just hate the fact I had to give WWE money to get it.  That is all WWE is good for anymore in my eyes, releasing old NWA, AWA, and World Class stuff.

1334121,"If this movie helps anyone with a substance abuse problem, then it will have served a noble purpose, but the film, despite decent, if at times slightly over-acted performances, possibly due to trying to squeeze too much into short scenes, didn't exactly carry me along, even though I like the actors.  The romance between the two main characters was not convincing to me, although Maggie Gyllenhaal's mastery of the erotic was excellent, as always.The inconsistent editing gave a disjointed air to the movie (e.g. see the excellent comment by reviewer Mark Blackburn about the missing scene), while the cinematography was very good, and the sound quality was excellent as well, the latter two qualities being well served by the blu ray release.Maybe it was just me, but it seemed like the main character's music was better when he was dysfunctional, and a little on the boring side when he was functional.The movie also seemed like a bit of an Alcoholics Anonymous recruiting vehicle, which is fine for people who are helped, but struck me as a bit tedious and heavy handed.My two favorite scenes, in addition to Gyllenhaal's carrying the love scenes, were at the beginning when Bad gets out of his truck and emptys out the jug, and his back and forth with the sound man during a rehearsal for an opening an act for a concert by Tommy.  Jeff Bridges and Colin Farrell both give convincing musical performances, and Robert Duval is always fun to watch, although his cameo appearance is brief.And, it would be churlish not to mention the wonderful performances by the back up bands who perform in the movie, and, once again, the excellent sound engineering.",Crazy Heart

1678643,"A mere seventeen episodes constitutes the entirety of Joanie Loves Chachi: The Complete Series. As slight as that sounds, I found this slim three-disc set to be an overdose of sub-Laverne and Shirley unfunniness, songs that would never threaten and hit lists during any era, supporting characters not even their own mothers could love, and storylines so bereft of originality the second to last episode actually resorted to using Happy Days flashbacks!Do I sound unnecessarily harsh? If so, it's because I'm pissed off at how little apparent interest creator Garry Marshall and company had in delivering a series worth watching. First, there's the concept: Joanie and Chachi decide to chase their dreams and sing with a band, playing nightly at Delvecchio's restaurant. Think about that for a moment&#8230;When you go out for a nice Italian dinner, do you really want a rock group thrashing away at songs you've never heard before, and being sung by a man with a tin throat? Scott Baio is many things&#8212;incredibly charming, handsome, and when given the chance, a fine actor&#8212;but musical is not one of them!And then, there's the rest of &#34;the band,&#34; who never actually rate a name. On bass guitar is Chachi's cousin Annette (Winifred Freedman); a cute, sweet and (slightly) chubby girl who gets routinely pelted with fat and ugly jokes. Nice, right? Annette's brother Mario (Derrel Maury) plays keyboards; a fairly good looking&#8212;if somewhat anonymous&#8212;kid, distinguished only by his pork pie hat. Finally, there's drummer Bingo (Robert Pierce), who wears Hawaiian shirts and Bermuda shorts, has a bushy blond perm, and speaks entirely in non-sequiturs, sounding just like Jeff Spicoli from Fast Times At Ridgemont High. That's right, he's a &#34;surfer dude&#34;&#8230;in Chicago.You want comedy? Here's a sample of what passes for witty repartee.Al: &#34;Bingo, listen, the band is late again. Now, we can't wait forever. Isn't there something you can do?&#34;Bingo: &#34;If you could get me a bowl of cereal, I can pick out the riboflavin.&#34;Here's more.(Chachi is clearing tables at the restaurant when he sees Joanie's ex-boyfriend enter, and take a seat. Hoping to avoid a confrontation, Chachi darts behind the bar, where Mario is standing, and crouches down next to him.)Mario: &#34;You know, Chachi, when you crouch down like that, you're the exact height as my grandmother.&#34;Unfortunately, Paramount's DVD presentation of Joanie Loves Chachi: The Complete Series suits the middling-to-awful material all too well. The 1.33:1 standard def full frame image looks pretty good, but many of the episodes suffer from flicker at the top of the frame, and the pilot appears to have taken a bit of a beating (watchable, but roughed-up). The Dolby 2.0 Mono audio is more successful, clearly amplifying Mr. Baio's vocal performances, so beware. (Note: According to Mr. Todd Fuller, founder of the excellent Sitcoms Online website, several episodes have had musical numbers edited out!) Subtitles have been provided, but nothing else, which is curious, as all the major cast members, Marshall, and many of the show's runners are still among the living. Again, that seeming total lack of interest on their part.Lest I leave you with the impression that Joanie Loves Chachi was among the very worst endeavors in TV series history, I feel obligated to mention there were some obviously talented performers involved (who couldn't love Molinaro and Travolta?). But somehow their efforts were squandered or taken for granted, if not altogether ignored. I'm speaking specifically of Erin Moran. By the time this series bowed, the then twenty one year old actress was a fifteen year showbiz veteran, who'd grown from a freckled tomboy into a stunningly beautiful woman with an incredible singing voice. In this critic's humble opinion, no bigger mistake was made by the spin-off's producers than their decision to make Moran a junior partner in the musical element of the series. Check out her amazing slow-burn rendition of early '60s classic &#34;He's So Fine&#34; at the end of the episode &#34;Term Paper.&#34; It'll blow your mind.Judge P.S.

1646505,"Following the first entry in the &#8220;Golden Age Trilogy&#8221;, The Battle for Doldrey manages to surpass its predecessor in almost every regard. After a brief recap of the plot of the first film, we&#8217;re thrown right back into battle accompanied by &#8220;Aria&#8221; the theme composed by the great Susumu Hirasawa. I also need to make mention of the rest of the fantastic music here, done by Shiro Sagisu, which is fittingly dark and brooding.The Band of the Hawk has been on a winning streak in the Hundred Years War, earning considerable renown in the kingdom of Midland. Guts is still hacking away at everything in sight, contributing more than his fare share to the glory of the lowborn band of mercenaries. Their exploits earn Griffith a spot at the King&#8217;s war council, where he undertakes the challenge of recapturing Doldrey, a long thought impenetrable fortress. He not only wants to take this fortress, but he sets out to do so using only five thousand men against its modest 30,000.The movie can be divided into two basic halves, the first contains the bloody and brutal campaign that the series is known for, and the second is the character drama of the aftermath. In both cases, the movie works extremely well. Much like the first, director Toshiyuki Kubooka knows how to pace the story, cutting what he needs to and keeping in all that is necessary without sacrificing the flow. The result is a very tightly packed drama with a lot of development for even some of the lesser characters that went somewhat ignored in the first entry. The other captains, who were little more than extras in the first story, are now given important roles in the story to establish who they are, particularly the female warrior Casca.The battles are epic in scope and don&#8217;t overstay their welcome. There&#8217;s only so much hacking and slashing that we need to see, so the fights scenes are kept fast and decisively brutal. With his giant sword, Guts tears through enemies like they&#8217;re made of tissue paper. In the end, the movie flows much better, not having to deal with large gaps of time and keeping a more focused view on the characters and their struggles, linking the main three together with their brutal, cruel pasts.There&#8217;s plenty of story and subplots that were cut from either the original comic or the animated series, but their done so efficiently, leaving the main story unhindered by their absence. Where the movie really distinguishes itself however, is in what&#8217;s new. Given that an entire show has already covered this exact material, much of it is familiar to say the least. This time however, there are new sequences that you won&#8217;t find in any other version of the story, and this is what was sorely missing from the previous movie. Taking liberties for the sake of diversity are not unwelcome in a retelling.Keeping with the animation style of the trilogy, the movie is a blend of CG and more traditional animation. The 3D models are used predominately for the battle scenes, allowing for a lot of characters to flesh out the massive armies onscreen. When these characters are shown up close, it&#8217;s still a bit stiff, but it&#8217;s also a noticeable improvement over the first movie. It&#8217;s used sparingly and often intermixed with the regular animation, making it considerably less obvious throughout. Like a said, it&#8217;s a major improvement.The rest of the animation is stunningly beautiful, particularly in the gorgeous backdrops and colorful locations. The city of Windham during the parade for the Band of the Hawk as flower petals seemingly fall from the sky is particularly triumphant and memorable, just as the morning light creeping in through the trees over a hundred man massacre in the forest is equally haunting and oddly serene.I enjoyed The Egg of the King quite a bit, but The Battle for Doldrey is an improvement in almost every way. It has a better grasp on the characters and their complexities, improves on the animation style, and just tells another great part of an incredible story.",Berserk: Golden Age Arc II - Battle for Doldrey

579277,"But, I really don't think that they applied any much effort in the remastering of this film for Blu-ray.  I have my share of grainy looking Blu-Ray discs, but they were much older than this one.Perhaps this film was just a low budget effort at the time because for a film that had a lot of music, it was still only released in mono. Heck, not even two channel stereo. From 1984, that's pretty weak. Don't you think?I've had the DVD for many years and I actually think that it still looks better than this Blu-ray.  Perhaps the DVD is a little muddier (having a slight, but expected, soft blurring, so to speak) and perhaps that made it look less grainy.Anyway, we can not help but to want to constantly keep replacing our DVD's with Blu-ray's, but I'm gonna keep my DVD of Bachelor Party because on my smaller 32"" TV, it looks better than the Blu-ray does on my 60"" TV.I liked the picture on the cover of the DVD better also.",N/A

I got rid of the DVD and just don't have any use for this type of trash. It is glorifying the black ghetto foul-mouthed gangsta-rap type of language, and that is nothing to glorify. The movie is saying this type of language is OK. It is expressing its pro-Socialist/Marxist class-struggle-scenario anti-capitalist message (a typical Hollywood-style of propagandized message) while doing so.

1697267,"4 Stars for Lovers of Bad Movies or Fans of The Books2 Stars for Everyone ElseEarlier this year, the Lifetime network premiered a new interpretation of the 1979 cult novel ""Flowers in the Attic"" by V.C. Andrews featuring Heather Graham, Mad Men's Kiernan Shipka, and the incomparable Ellen Burstyn. While I appreciated that this adaptation tried to stay truer to the source novel than the previous film version, it lacked a bit of suspense for my taste. Aside from Burstyn, the entire production was missing a bite and energy which left a certain blandness in its wake. Maybe they tried to be too reverent to the plotting and lost track of how the piece should make you feel (unsettled and uncomfortable). For good or bad, Lifetime has committed to bringing the novel's sequels to the air as well. I think it's fair to say that ""Petals on the Wind"" is not a particularly good movie, but at least it's a lot more lunatic fun than its predecessor. As the movie zips along with cartoon villainy, elaborate revenge schemes, and a truly Gothic horror finale, I found the movie entirely entertaining if you can embrace its bad movie mojo.""Petals on the Wind"" picks up ten years later than the events of the previous movie. Cathy, Christopher and Carrie are still haunted by their days in the attic. Cathy (now played by Rose McIver) is an aspiring ballerina, Christopher (Wyatt Nash) is a medical student, and Carrie (Bailey Buntain) is a tormented high school student. Their adopted father and benefactor has recently died, and they face a brave new world as adults. As they struggle with their new destiny, the life they left behind is never far from memory. As both of the older siblings attempt grown-up relationships (while struggling with the lingering attraction for one another), the screenplay races through a number of twists and turns. Cathy's trip to New York to be a prima ballerina, for example, is so rushed as to be almost laughable. Strangely enough, though, that is part of the movie's charm. At the shocking end of this particular storyline (on the opening night of a rather lackluster Romeo and Juliet), I simply had to laugh out loud. It was all so spectacularly silly, but I don't want to spoil any of its pleasures.Of course, what we are all waiting for is the final showdown between mother and children. Graham spends the entire movie renovating the family home while Burstyn is mostly absent (and, sadly, she is missed). After some more plotting and machinations, the kids force a confrontation at an elaborate party that embraces a delightful lunacy that I loved. As I mentioned, ""Petals on the Wind"" is never particularly good (the performances and dialogue can be stilted and painful) but it is loopy enough to be enjoyable. Burstyn shines in her brief appearance and even the wooden Heather Graham has some nice moments at the end. I credit this adaptation for just going for it and embracing its madness. I laughed along with ""Petals on the Wind"" and, for me, that was enough. I didn't find it shocking or moving, I found it spirited, somewhat twisted, and a lot of fun.

1329111,"Nine Things about the Movie &#8220;Blue Valentine&#8221; [USA, 2010]1. This movie is a brave portrayal of the last part of a relationship, when &#8220;Happily Ever After&#8221; turns out to be false.2. It was written and directed by Derek Cianfrance. It stars Ryan Gosling and Michelle Williams. Three years after this move was made, Gosling and Cianfrance paired up again for &#8220;The Place Beyond the Pines&#8221;.3. The movie moves back and forth between two times: The first is the &#8220;love at first sight&#8221; period when they genuinely believe they will be together forever. The second is the disintegration period some five years later, when they realize &#8220;for better or worse&#8221; is not what they expected.. The genius here is that eventually you realize you are sometimes seeing almost the same scene being depicted in each period...but with different circumstances.4. Gosling and Williams have a genuine, believable chemistry. You believe that they are in love, and you believe the bitterness that grows between them. They should have won some kind of acting award for their performances.5. To make it more realistic, Gosling and Williams acted like a couple before filming the downhill slide. They rented a house together, and lived according to their characters&#8217; budgets.6. In some of the scenes, Gosling and Williams went without scripted dialogue; they improvised it as they were being filmed.7. The power of the movie comes not only from the big arguments the couple has, but the small moments, too: the ignored caress, the eyes that hide the truth, the awkward silences.8. At first, the film got an NC-17 rating, for it&#8217;s depiction of Michelle Williams receiving oral sex. The rating was appealed, and Gosling accused the ratings board of sexism and misogyny, noting that plenty of movies depict males receiving oral sex, and it&#8217;s not considered a big deal. The rating was changed to R.9. None of the relationships in the movie are happy, not even the long-lasting ones. Everyone is dealing with the death of love in some form or another. Well, unless they are admitting that they never felt it in the first place.",N/A

The little town and its occupants are predictable and what comes next doesn't require a crystal ball, but the acting and the writing style makes up for that in numberous ways.
